<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, this week I have the tremendous pleasure of talking to Ger Milstein. Now, if that name doesn't ring an immediate bell, I'm sure the name of this company will, which is Tiptop Audio Tiptop is one of my favorite companies for Euro Rack modular gear. And they have been around for a long, long time. And one of the reasons that they've existed for this, this long is that they make great gear that is stable as rocks. So, given that, I was really excited to be able to have this chance to talk to him. And with that, I'll introduce him. Hi, ger, how are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur Milstein: </b>Hi, Darwin I'm good. Thank you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Ah, thank you so much for being willing to talk, to talk to me today. It's really, an honor for me. Thank you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>Appreciate the good words, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Yeah, well, like I said, I've been a long time user of your stuff, and it's, I've, I've always just been really impressed by this, how solid the engineering and, and stuff is. Why don't we kick this off by, first of all, having you give a quick overview of how you like to describe your company and what kind of things you're, are you're currently excited about? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>Yeah. Well, this is a good question, <laugh>. Yeah. I think tiptop, you know, is, is something that is evolving. So it's kind of hard to pinpoint something specifically, is what it is. 'cause I think that, as we move forward and we develop new instruments, we kinda looking back and say, okay, what we have just created and what can be done with that? And once we get our heads around that, we go back again and like, oh, so we can do this and that. So how can that be expanded or like, this is really cool, or this is not really cool, or, so, I would say the tip <span style="color:red" data-ts="119.845" data-end_ts="120.005" title="119.845" id=c_"119.845">__top__</span> in general is a technology company because, we are taking what we see as what the, you know, the founders of analog circuitry, left back in the late eighties. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>And, basically we continue from there. Sure. The world of electronics changed a lot since there because, it's, in a way it's easier to develop electronics these days. What you had to do with a pencil and a paper back then, you can do, you know, with mouse <span style="color:red" data-ts="150.125" data-end_ts="150.325" title="150.125" id=c_"150.125">__on__</span> a screen. And, and you can automate a lot of functions, during the design stage. So, we, we can, we can dream, we can dream larger than I think what, people could do back in the seventies and eighties, and really implement large scale, systems, in a small, footprint. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Well that, and that certainly describes how it is that we end up with Eurorack, as the predominant thing. I think back in the day, there was no way to even wedge any reasonable amount of musical circuitry in something the size of a Eurorack system now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>Exactly. Exactly. And, and for me, you know, when I started, I was looking at different formats. My first systems that I built were actually banana jacks, and there were just no format. They were just like, you know, panels I made myself without any restriction. But as I become more and more, involved <span style="color:red" data-ts="210.745" data-end_ts="210.965" title="210.745" id=c_"210.745">__in__</span>, you know, in the design of things rather than just, you know, DIY, I realized the opportunities to really squeeze all that amount into small panels and urac really made more, more sense than anything. Sure. And, you know, a lot of people don't even know that URAC is actually not a musical instrument standard. It's a, it's an industrial standard for, control system, you know, and industrial facilities. So, it's ha it has been there for many, many years and, and that laid out the foundation a really good and solid foundation from an engineering point of view for something that can grow up, and, and really be reliable over the long run. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Yeah, that makes, that makes a lot of sense. So, you kind of talk about having, giving a nod to the work of, of the master's past one. One of the things I like doing in my podcast is having people kind of describe how they got to be, the artist, engineer, maker, builder, inventor that they are. And I'm really curious because it sounds like you've been sort of a synth builder for a lot longer than you've been a businessman about it. And I'm curious to hear <laugh> Yeah. About, about your journey, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b><laugh>. Yeah. Well, first I still don't think I'm not the greatest, businessman <laugh>. But yeah, you know, you have to learn it when, when things start moving so fast. Yeah, so I'll give you a little background of, you know, the history of how I become what I've become. So, I started many, many years ago. I always been into music, you know, as a kid. I was a, you know, the local area dj, I was, you know, and, and I always like, also mechanical things and electrical things, you know, breaking things apart and checking them out. So I think I had those two qualities, but I, I never got them really connected together. It's only took, I think in the very late eighties and early nineties that I, I start hearing, what's called, you know, today everybody knows it as techno. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>Back then, it was pretty fresh, right. And that style of music really captured my mind and captured my soul. And, and I just, you know, went into it completely as one of the disciples of, you know, of that music back then. And at some point in time, I, I really wanna start making that kind of music, and it was fascinating. Where are those <span style="color:red" data-ts="355.245" data-end_ts="355.525" title="355.245" id=c_"355.245">__sounds__</span> coming from? Is, you know, it was like so fresh and new to me. And that's where I discovered for the first time, the modular synthesizer. I <span style="color:red" data-ts="363.565" data-end_ts="363.805" title="363.565" id=c_"363.565">__started__</span> seeing pictures of, you know, studios of people working with this stuff. And that was the early, you know, the Moog systems, the EMU systems, you know, the very early, you know, good stuff that was done by then. And obviously I was, start being aware of, the polyphonic analog <span style="color:red" data-ts="379.465" data-end_ts="379.685" title="379.465" id=c_"379.465">__sin__</span> of that time and, you know, and their power. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>And one thing I couldn't do is I couldn't buy this stuff. I was too broke and too young. And, I think that's <span style="color:red" data-ts="389.245" data-end_ts="389.325" title="389.245" id=c_"389.245">__a__</span> story we all go through. Yes. And, I was like, okay, you know, let me try and see maybe I can try and build that stuff. And to remind you, these were the earliest internet days, so all of a sudden you can talk to someone, you know, in the United States or in Europe, and I was based in Israel back then, so, you're pretty isolated over there, you know, and if you want to get some information, you really need to either, you know, fly back then or do like a long distance call. So, I, you know, I went online and there was like a, a synthesizer do it yourself mailing list, and over there I met crazy people just like me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>And it, it was already a miracle. <span style="color:red" data-ts="432.225" data-end_ts="432.445" title="432.225" id=c_"432.225">__It__</span> was like, wow, okay, I'm not the only, you know, I'm not the only crazy guy in town. And, I found some, you know, PCBs that people made of mostly clones, of all designs. And I start building those, circuits and remarkably they worked. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="450.115" data-end_ts="450.405" title="450.115" id=c_"450.115">__that__</span> was a moment of, you know, of <span style="color:red" data-ts="451.885" data-end_ts="452.125" title="451.885" id=c_"451.885">__tear__</span> and joys. And I, you know, I stayed in that phase for I think maybe one or two years, just keep building more and more stuff and building myself a big modular synthesizer and all getting excited about it. Like, oh my God, I got the gear I always wanted, and here is the sound, this is it. And, and, you know, and another thing happened those days is everybody was ditching analog and everybody were going through computer and digital, right. So I felt even more like, oh, I'm the, you know, the weird kid in the neighborhood, <laugh> <laugh>, you know, with the solar iron, like the weird, crazy professor there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>But, I, I believed in it because then immediately when I heard the sound coming off on the analog oscillator, it was like, okay, that's it. This is it. This is what I was looking for. That's the sound. And obviously I <span style="color:red" data-ts="498.405" data-end_ts="498.485" title="498.405" id=c_"498.405">__would__</span> start buying books and learning about the industry and the people and, you know, everything that involved, what hit me at some point is that I was trying to understand the circuits. And, at that point I was going to the Tel Aviv University, and I was, buying books, you know, for, electrical engineering Sure. And trying to study myself, you know, as much as I can. And I did that and it went well, but I always felt it up to a point where I was, there was a ceiling, you know, I couldn't pass that. I could never get my oscillator to tune very well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>I could never get the filter to be like really low noises, you know, as I could hear in some other, you know, either kits or even even sound recordings that I heard. Right. At that point, I felt that, you know, the, the knowledge, the technical aspect of it, the musical aspect, they all come and get together. And I really fell in love with the process of building those syns and getting to know how they work. So, my imagination took me on a whole different path all of a sudden. So originally I was like into it to build my own instruments and make my own music, but all of a sudden I was like, wow, I really like the, the, the technical aspect of that. Right. At that point, I decide, okay, I understand that this is a situation. I have a ceiling above me, what do I do? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>And I decided I'm gonna go to the university and, become an electrical engineer. And that's is probably the, the, was the, the right decision at the right time. I was, I think 27 years old when I did that. And, I said, you know, it, I, it cannot be a wrong decision. You know, you can always, it's like an insurance income in life. You're either gonna have a job as an electrical engineer in Motorola, or, or I'd be able to make some musical instruments at some point in life, right. But for sure I'll be able to tune my oscillators <laugh> <laugh>. And, yeah, that was the, that was the, the main goal. And then the interesting part was that when I went to the university and I was sitting at a class, I really liked it and I really enjoyed it because when the teacher was drawing sign waves on the board, I knew what sound waves are, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>I knew how they sound. And everybody around me looked at me like, crazy, what are you talking about? Like, I was like, guys come, there's another aspect of a <span style="color:red" data-ts="640.005" data-end_ts="640.205" title="640.005" id=c_"640.005">__sign__</span> wave behind the shape. It's not just a shape you see on a scope. It has a, it has a, it is a feeling, it's a sound come over, I'll let you hear it. So, you know, a lot of students don't even know that the electronic has another medium other than, you know, the visualized you can see on a scoreboard, <span style="color:red" data-ts="656.685" data-end_ts="656.805" title="656.685" id=c_"656.685">__a__</span> simulation, <span style="color:red" data-ts="657.495" data-end_ts="657.845" title="657.495" id=c_"657.495">__right__</span>? Right. It's the actual, you can actually hear the electronics, you can actually hear what, you know, what you are seeing on the board. So it was really, really fascinating for me. And those years at school was just amazing. And I felt that, you know, I was learning and I was coming home and sometime I could even practice the things I was learning into my kids and things I was building. And then I, when I finished school, I finished it very well. And, I was grabbed into a company which was, it was basically, like a startup company who was, doing design for, semiconductor process control and process generation. It's a sub-company of, applied materials. And this is really, really high tech and scientific stuff over there. And for me, this was like the part of exposure I needed to turn my education into practice. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>It was something that I didn't want to do just because, you know, I was like, oh, that's what I wanna do in life. It was because I knew <span style="color:red" data-ts="720.885" data-end_ts="721.005" title="720.885" id=c_"720.885">__I__</span>, there's another phase I need to go through before I can be independent and, and start really do what I want to do. And that was a great bridge because over there I really learned the, the bare bones of electronic design. But I learned it from a different point of view, a little from the practice side. And I work with professors, which are just amazing. And, and you know, it, it was a, it's, it was a fountain of knowledge. You cannot get in the university. It's the real world. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, let me, lemme stop you here 'cause I already have like 50 questions I want to ask <laugh>, but a couple of a couple of things. First of all, roughly what time? Not, not that I'm gonna ask you to gimme your age exactly, but what, what years roughly was this that you were in university studying electrical engineering? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>I, I started 27, I think I finished, what was it, 31. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, no, but I mean, I mean, what year? Like was it in the two thousands yet or, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>Early, yeah, early 2000. Late interesting nineties of 2000. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Because one of the things that I had heard is that a lot of universities <span style="color:red" data-ts="786.265" data-end_ts="786.485" title="786.265" id=c_"786.265">__ta__</span> sort of stopped teaching analog electronics. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>Very true. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Because it just wasn't widely used in industry anymore. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>Well, I think it's very much depends on the area because, <span style="color:red" data-ts="799.235" data-end_ts="799.845" title="799.235" id=c_"799.235">__Australia__</span>, for example, is a country with a lot of science and a lot of background in semiconductors. And semiconductors is still a very much analog design. Right. 'cause you design with transistors, it's true that eventually what you create are logic, you know, big logic 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Digital logics, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>Right? Yeah, exactly. But the, the bare bones of them are transistor. It's mostly analog design. I see. So there is a lot of respect to that, okay. Over there. And, you can see it, sinking down into the universities. And, I was actually very lucky because I had a teacher who was, he was amazing in analog design, and you could see he loved the thing. Right. And that, you know, it's always about that. It's either you got somebody with passion and I, I, you know, a good teacher can change your life. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Absolutely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>And you know <span style="color:red" data-ts="845.125" data-end_ts="845.285" title="845.125" id=c_"845.125">__what__</span>? A worst teacher can destroy your life. I really believe in that because when I was in high school, I, I hardly finished <span style="color:red" data-ts="851.405" data-end_ts="851.685" title="851.405" id=c_"851.405">__hard__</span> high school. And, you know, part of it is because the teachers there just couldn't fulfill my, my imagination, I think, you know, at that time. Right. And, and to the, the opposite, this guy was just so amazing that, you know, up to this date, I'm still in touch with him. And, he's now a big guy in the university and he grew up and he, and you know, he deserved this because he was just amazing. And for me it was, he was an inspiration, but also, you know, a lot, a lot of knowledge. And you can see he likes what he do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's fantastic. Yeah. Cool. So I didn't mean to sidetrack you, but I was just really curious because of this, it, it just seems like as, as, I don't know, it seems like the whole electronic industry just fell in love with the idea of cell phones and everything went, everything else went away for a long period of time. Yeah. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, so I was curious about how you were able to <span style="color:red" data-ts="907.025" data-end_ts="907.245" title="907.025" id=c_"907.025">__get__</span>, engage in the analog work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>So again, you know, for me, once I heard the analog sound right, I knew that's it. And for me, not only that, it was a battle because in those days, everybody were teaching their analog. Right. And not only that, they talk really bad about analog back days. Right. And digital was the new frontier and who even needs analog anymore. And I thought myself sometimes like, am I stupid or what's going on over here? You know, right 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, now there was, you know, so I, I kind of came up right around, you know, similar times, and I too was very entranced by, the sound of techno, the sound of techno spoke to my soul in a way that no other soul music would really do. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>Yep. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But, I was not, I was not technical. I, I used to joke that I always had trouble figuring out which end of the soldering iron to hold <laugh>. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="963.945" data-end_ts="964.165" title="963.945" id=c_"963.945">__Oh__</span>, that's tricky. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I've gotten better at that through hard work, but <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>And pain 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And pain. But one of the things that I remember is I used to have a studio. I, you know, I, I kind of was lucky because as people were dumping their analog stuff, I was kind of sitting at the bottom of the stairs with my arm out catching them before they hit the sidewalk. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>Wow. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And so I ended up with this enormous, wonderful studio full of analog sense. Wow. Except since I wasn't technical, three quarters of them were some in some way broken at any given time. Right. Because one of the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1001.285" data-end_ts="1001.485" title="1001.285" id=c_"1001.285">__doubt__</span>, one of the things that people don't recognize as part of that transition was that people were like, oh my God, this digital stuff hardly ever breaks down 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b><laugh>. Yeah. It's true. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, to, to what extent did you find that, that you were, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1018.105" data-end_ts="1018.325" title="1018.105" id=c_"1018.105">__the__</span>, the fact that you were adept at electronics helped you sort of bridge the gap with, with regards to analog stuff? Did that make it easier for you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>I think it did because once I, well, okay. I never had the opportunity to own a lot of vintage <span style="color:red" data-ts="1036.255" data-end_ts="1036.605" title="1036.255" id=c_"1036.255">__since__</span>. Oh, okay. I had opportunity to go to big studios around the world and meet people and try the gear and, you know, get to know it better that way. But I never really have like a collection of modules, to, you know, sit down and play with them. I see. I, I, I guess I didn't need to, you know, because the things I built is, is pretty raw, but it sounds amazing immediately. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1059.485" data-end_ts="1059.685" title="1059.485" id=c_"1059.485">__Right__</span>, right. And that's one of the things, like, I, I saw my friend sitting, you know, with a digital, you know, multi-track and trying to layer sounds over and over, like, you know, 20 channels of, of the same sound to get it bigger. Right. And I was like, just turning my oscillator, like, wow, that's all at once. Right. So I, I never had this, this phase. I, I, it, for me, it was immediately straight analog. And, and, you know, it might sound like I'm, I'm not liking digital and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1086.605" data-end_ts="1086.725" title="1086.605" id=c_"1086.605">__that__</span>, which is definitely not the case. It's just that the analog was the, the analog and the struggle to do analog, especially at <span style="color:red" data-ts="1094.645" data-end_ts="1094.845" title="1094.645" id=c_"1094.645">__the__</span>, that time was something that become like a passion for me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. And well, it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1100.525" data-end_ts="1100.685" title="1100.525" id=c_"1100.525">__the__</span>, yeah, it's the thing that was driving now. What kind of music were you making? And, did you ever, were you like in any, ever any groups or did you ever have releases or anything like that? Or did you focus more on the technology? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>I did a lot of music back then when I, made the, the gear that I built myself, recorded it. You know what? I don't think I have even half of it today. God knows where it is. I never been into a band, I've never been on, you know, live stage, just myself. But I was a DJ for many years, so I know, you know, I know the feeling and, and I know what it is to, play to like, you know, 3000 people, in the middle of the forest. Right. <laugh>. So, yeah, I, I got a lot of, a lot of hours in clubs and, and music events. So I know the thing inside out. Right. But I never really sat down and kind of play the, or made my own music that I can feel comfortable to, to put out. But it will come one day 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Well, it, it should, because right now isn't, my understanding is Tip <span style="color:red" data-ts="1167.725" data-end_ts="1167.925" title="1167.725" id=c_"1167.725">__Top__</span> audio has put out a, a music release, haven't they? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>Yes, that's true. That's very true. Yeah. And that's, you know, for me that's, that shows you that life. If you really believe in something and you like what you do, great things can happen because Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Indeed. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>For me, it's like, you know, I created the Canvas. I created a paint and I gave it to the artist, and they created these amazing masterpieces and, I'm able to print them <span style="color:red" data-ts="1191.465" data-end_ts="1191.685" title="1191.465" id=c_"1191.465">__now__</span> on I'm a record. Sure. Right. And bring 'em up to, you know, to the world. And, that is really the feedback, you know, that you kind of get from, from doing something that you really love, is that, if, if you like it and you enjoy doing it, it's there and people will use it and people will share it with you. And, yeah, the release has been going great. We've been working with, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1213.955" data-end_ts="1214.245" title="1213.955" id=c_"1213.955">__PIRO__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1214.545" data-end_ts="1214.765" title="1214.545" id=c_"1214.545">__Ola__</span> from Italy. He's part of, the Band Angle. They're also on that, on the first release Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, he's been basically the guy behind the label pushing it forward, and, getting in touch with all the artists and, you know, it's, it's one of those thing, we never restrict anybody. Oh, you have to use only our gear or whatever, you know, and all kind of stuff. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1236.325" data-end_ts="1236.565" title="1236.325" id=c_"1236.325">__Right__</span>, right. Because, you know, it's, it's music, music. You use the trumpet and you use the drum, and they're not necessarily made by the same man. Right. So, so I think that that is, is it on a lot of people let them feel that, you know, it's not a marketing pitch, it's really something artistic, you know, either it goes, either it doesn't, but it is what it is. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and it's, and, and the fact that you have the background as a, as a DJ means that the process of doing releases is actually really, really important to you because Yes, as a dj you're dependent on creative people <span style="color:red" data-ts="1268.945" data-end_ts="1269.165" title="1268.945" id=c_"1268.945">__to__</span> do releases, and so Absolutely. So you <span style="color:red" data-ts="1271.605" data-end_ts="1271.765" title="1271.605" id=c_"1271.605">__have__</span>, you have an understanding of how important that is. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>And, and even more, you know, it's like, it's very rare that people, release things on vinyl today, because in most chances you won't even pay off <span style="color:red" data-ts="1283.725" data-end_ts="1283.925" title="1283.725" id=c_"1283.725">__for__</span>, for the investment. But I insisted on that. I said, you know, I'm not gonna be releasing anything, without getting in <span style="color:red" data-ts="1290.405" data-end_ts="1290.525" title="1290.405" id=c_"1290.405">__on__</span> vinyl as well, because first of all, I listen to stuff on vinyl, and I think, just like the way, you know, analog in, in musical instruments get back, there's no doubt in my mind that, you know, analogs in some sort doesn't necessarily need to be a vinyl, but analog will come back, in some form of media, that we might not know today. And it's important to keep it alive, just so people know that, you know, things can sound different. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I, I absolutely agree. And I, I don't know, I think actually Vinyl has, is a strong player here. I was at a, at a bookstore on, you know, one of these national book chains the other day. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and, big Sign in the Front window, we have vinyl 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>Wow. <laugh>. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>If, if a bar, if a Barnes and Noble, if the Barnes and Noble system's gonna start carrying vinyl, there's, there's some, there's some opportunity there. And, and frankly, recently, I, I ordered some, I ordered some music for myself, and I searched out vinyl because there's not only the sound, but even just interacting with the music in that way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>Yes, exactly. Hearing 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It for that specific length of time, those kind of things are all a real valuable way of, or part of hearing the music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>Totally. I just heard, like, an interview with the Sting a few days ago, and he was talking about how he's making now a movie for theater, and, they were asking him like, wow, why theater from, you know, from everything else. And it was because it's the only medium today where I can create a whole set of songs that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1382.885" data-end_ts="1383.005" title="1382.885" id=c_"1382.885">__I__</span> will be followed the way I want 'em to be followed. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>Right. You know, I can make the story, and you know, this, this is, this is a good point. Right. But it's, it's interesting times, you know, a lot of changes, a lot <span style="color:red" data-ts="1394.245" data-end_ts="1394.365" title="1394.245" id=c_"1394.245">__of__</span> the technology really hits the music business from a lot of sides. And, I think in a way it's probably, it's probably the only thing in human history where we went backwards, <laugh>, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Maybe so. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>Yeah. But, sometimes you need to go back in order to move, you know, in 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Order to understand why you want to move forward 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>Exactly. And have the energy to do so. Right. Getting 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Back to your history, you came outta school and you went and you got some real world experience. Yes. At this company. I think it's really cool because it sounds like you knew what you needed to learn, and this was a great avenue for you to do that. Yes. So how did you go from commercial electrical engineer or electronics engineer to a guy living in, on the west coast of the us Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> making modules. What's, what's the connecting thread there? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>I think that there was <span style="color:red" data-ts="1448.765" data-end_ts="1448.885" title="1448.765" id=c_"1448.765">__a__</span>, a point in time where I realized that, that's it. I got the knowledge and I can do it. I was also very frustrated with, those who were selling, analog gear back then. Because I felt, either they were dishonest about stuff or, they would just keep you waiting for stuff for a very long time. Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1472.005" data-end_ts="1472.125" title="1472.005" id=c_"1472.005">__I__</span>, I, again, I couldn't fulfill my dream, which my dream was like, I wanted a modular studio. I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1476.725" data-end_ts="1476.925" title="1476.725" id=c_"1476.725">__want__</span> a big system where I can compose a complete track song on, on it. Sure. And, I needed sequences. I needed quantizer. I needed the VCAs. I I needed so much gear, and I needed reliable, and I needed in time, and it was just, it wasn't there. And not to mention the prices, which were just ridiculous. And at that point, I was like, okay, you know what, again, I'm at the exactly same, intersection, and if I cannot, buy it, I'm gonna build it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>And, from that point, I just left the company I worked for, and, I had some money in my pocket from all this, months I was working there. And, I say, okay, let's start doing it. And I start doing the, I learned how to design printed circuit boards. I knew how to design the, the schematics themselves. And, I had references, obviously, to design again, that was done, you know, in the seventies and the eighties. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I start with a project which was called ACS, the, the tag <span style="color:red" data-ts="1536.765" data-end_ts="1537.005" title="1536.765" id=c_"1536.765">__name__</span> for <span style="color:red" data-ts="1537.165" data-end_ts="1537.285" title="1537.165" id=c_"1537.165">__there__</span> was like analog control systems. And the whole idea was that, back then I wanted a sequencer that works. I didn't like working with a computer as a sequencer. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>I already had the oscillators and filters and VCAs, and these <span style="color:red" data-ts="1550.925" data-end_ts="1551.085" title="1550.925" id=c_"1550.925">__were__</span>, these were like, okay. You know, they kind worked, but I couldn't work. And, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1555.425" data-end_ts="1555.645" title="1555.425" id=c_"1555.425">__the__</span>, we are talking about, windows, 97, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, not fun. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>Not fun. Not fun at all with Cubase. And, yeah, not fun. It is like, an understatement, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1566.845" data-end_ts="1567.045" title="1566.845" id=c_"1566.845">__that__</span> that stuff just wasn't reliable and you could work with it really, and meaty and, you know, just, it's a, it's a mix. It's a bag of tricks. And, I said, I'm gonna build analog sequences, which I was totally fascinated by them. And I learned some things, you know, when I was working, at that company, I learned some things which were, how should we call them? Sensitive. And, I was, exposed to some interesting, technologies. And I decided I'm gonna make the world's most precise, fastest sequencer ever to be made. And that was my goal. And I created that sequencer. And, it was a one row of, 16 step with a high precision quantizer that I built next to it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>And you could just stack those rows, and all of a sudden you got this massive wall of, I think I had like eight or nine of those sequences, and it all played together, and it was amazing. And I start, doing some music. And then what happened is that I show it to some friends, and they wanted some, and I think this is the first time where people came over and like, Hey, would you mind, you know, can I, can I buy this for me? I was like, are you kidding me? No. How long it took me to build this thing <laugh>, you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Couldn't pay me enough. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>Yeah, exactly. And I was like, you know, okay, okay, I'll befriend with you. I got build you one. And I start finding myself, you know, soloing, you know, resistors and capacitors and ships and all that kind of stuff. And I sell, sold a few systems to people in Europe and in the States. And, through this experience, I met a lot of, you know, good people too. And then I moved to Germany, and I lived there for I think, almost a year. I lived in Frankfurt, which is pretty much the center of, you know, where techno came from. Right. And over there, I got inspired again, by the music, which, you know, kept evolving and, by the artist and, and the vibe. But over there I felt that I don't have the marketing, you know, the, I didn't know how, how to sell stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>I felt I got really interesting things in my hand, but I, I couldn't really, I didn't know how to approach people. So then I got back to Israel, and then I had a different opportunity with a guy I met, through common friends who was also in Israel, lived in the United States, who was a, a big, a big, mixing engineer in Hollywood. His name is <span style="color:red" data-ts="1707.445" data-end_ts="1707.645" title="1707.445" id=c_"1707.445">__Tall__</span> Hertzberg. He passed away, three years ago. He, he was a smart guy, and he came with an idea for a guitar, product. And, we were talking on the internet and he says, Hey, why don't you come to the States and let's try and make this together. And I say, you know, I don't have anything to lose. Let me try <span style="color:red" data-ts="1725.365" data-end_ts="1725.445" title="1725.365" id=c_"1725.365">__to__</span> do that. And that's how I moved to the States. So I got here, and the interesting thing is, he was a mixing engineer at the record plant in la Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>Which, you know, is a very, famous and, ous thing. Yes. So, you know, I'm walking there at the aisle and Bono is walking next to me and, you know, all the big names. And here I am in the middle of the American industry, the music industry. And, it gave me an exposure of how things are done here. And, and it was very interesting to see the differences between Europe and here because, when I lived in Germany, I was walking in studios and things are very, very different the way people work here and the way people work there. And we did this project, which was, like a guitar switcher, which was very interesting. And we start trying to see maybe we can find a company to invest in us, and blah, blah, blah. And, I was trying to make to survive over here, and I was broke, and I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1779.245" data-end_ts="1779.445" title="1779.245" id=c_"1779.245">__started__</span> making websites for people, and I was start doing again, side jobs that weren't musical at all. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>Right. And then one day I decided, okay, you know, let me try and make a, like a module. And, and again, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1791.565" data-end_ts="1791.685" title="1791.565" id=c_"1791.565">__will__</span> start looking at the opportunities that, you know, the electronic world has been gone through, as far as the modernization of, assembly of electronics and the, the miniaturization of components. And I saw an opportunity and I said, okay, let me try and do some interesting things here. And interesting enough is that the first module I did was actually digital, and that was the first, DSP module ever to be made. We call it the Z 5,000. And, it was me and another guy sitting in, my apartment in Los Angeles, you know, watching the view of the mountains and soldering boards, <laugh>. And, back then I met, the guy who runs Analog Haven. It's the biggest shop in the West Coast. Right. And, he was very encouraging <span style="color:red" data-ts="1836.885" data-end_ts="1837.045" title="1836.885" id=c_"1836.885">__to__</span> say, Hey, you know, why don't you get me 25 pieces of that? And I was like, blown away by, wow, are you serious? Like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1843.825" data-end_ts="1844.045" title="1843.825" id=c_"1843.825">__who__</span> will buy 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>That? 2025? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>Yeah. 25 <laugh>. And, and, even more interesting, once we got them, they sold <span style="color:red" data-ts="1853.065" data-end_ts="1853.285" title="1853.065" id=c_"1853.065">__in__</span> less than 24 hours. So, it's more than one an hour <laugh> if you did the math. Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, it really was a fresh and interesting start, and it just picked up really, really fast. So we got this module, and then I start working on the Z 3000, which was another thing I always thought was important is, you know, musician don't talk frequencies. They talk, scales, they talk notes. And, I thought it would be important to make, an oscillator that speak that language. Right. And, the Z 3000, fill that niche, you know, with a building frequency counter and a tuner where you can, you know, you can communicate with that thing. And I took the time, you know, I took the time to really do, the design the way I like 'em and implement them from the background and experience I already got by that time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>Right. And, you know, I think this, this also is, is a classic already for many years it's been selling very well, and it's been known to be the, you know, the most precise and stable oscillator on the market. And things just kept growing. The, the company kept growing and there was more and more demand. And, you know, the 25, pieces order turned into 50, and the 50 turned into a hundred and a hundred to 200. And, you know, it just keeps growing. And all of a sudden I'm finding myself giving service to people, and I need to, you know, to deal with insurance, and I need to deal with rent, and I need to, you know, and you turn into a businessman. Right. And, like, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Like it or not. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>Exactly. Like it or not. And, you know, and, and there's good parts of it. And, you know, just like everything in life, you know, everything is interesting. You can find interest in pretty much anything you deal with, as long as you're positive about it. Sure. And, and I try to keep myself positive about it, and it went well. It, it was paying off, I was learning a little bit of business, and I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1966.285" data-end_ts="1966.445" title="1966.285" id=c_"1966.285">__start__</span> learning a little <span style="color:red" data-ts="1967.045" data-end_ts="1967.205" title="1967.045" id=c_"1967.045">__about__</span>, about marketing and, and you know, how do you present something, you know, because back in the days I realized you can have gold in your hand if you don't know how to sell it, if you don't know how to present it. Right. People won't see you get gold, you know? Right. You think you have some piece of metal there. Right. Right. <laugh>, they don't know what it is. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>They'll give you scrap metal prices for your 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>Exactly. Exactly. And not to mention that the world is full of people who will tell other people that, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1991.395" data-end_ts="1991.685" title="1991.395" id=c_"1991.395">__that__</span> piece of gold they had Right. A piece of metal they have is gold. So now, yeah. So it's, it's a tricky world. But, you know, living in America has been an amazing experience for me because, I really like the way people interact here and sharing information and, it helped me grow up the business into levels that I could never dream of. Yeah. And that brings us to, these days, I guess. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Indeed. Well, I have questions that kind of are, questions about your, the, the tiptop audio product line and how that relates to your background. So you talk about the, the first sort of real build that you did was a sequencer. But what's interesting is your product line doesn't have a typical sequencer. You've got the, you've got the Z 8,000, which is kind of a, well, it's, it's a Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, it's a sequencer that bends my head. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>Yes. <laugh>. That's what it does. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And then, and then you've got the trigger riot, which is a great trigger sequencing system. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But you don't have what anybody would typically call a standard analog sequencer. Why's that? Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>I think you missed one, fresh, and that's the circadian rhythms. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, yes, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>Yes. Which was just released. So, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>One that I haven't played with yet, so there you go. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>Exactly. Well, I'll, I'll, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'll, I'll send you my address. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>You see, the thing is, the experience I gained with sequencing system gave me, gave me different perspective about the way they can be implemented. Right. And, on one hand, I didn't wanna create one big giant sequencer that does it all because I thought, I, and I still think that we are not yet ready for that, us as a company. And, and I don't think, generally 'cause u is not yet glued together very well, as far as the standards. So the next <span style="color:red" data-ts="2117.965" data-end_ts="2118.205" title="2117.965" id=c_"2117.965">__best__</span>, best thing, is a modular, a modular in a modular, basically taking the, the control system and turn it into a modular, where you have components of it. So you have, you know, you have like a trigger sequencer, like the circadian rhythm or the trigger, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2133.365" data-end_ts="2133.645" title="2133.365" id=c_"2133.365">__right__</span>? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you have a CV sequencer, which is the Z thousand. There's a Quantis <span style="color:red" data-ts="2137.405" data-end_ts="2137.565" title="2137.405" id=c_"2137.405">__that__</span> we're now coming with, which is, very interesting, which is gonna fulfill the, the notes and the scales and, and that part of the, of the formula. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So you're gonna basically modularize the concept of a sequencer. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>Exactly. And, you know, I found, you know, I talk with a lot of artists and, the most interesting thing is like, the feedback you get is that some people see things in a certain way and other see in a totally different way, and you cannot satisfy everybody. Right. So usually <span style="color:red" data-ts="2167.955" data-end_ts="2168.245" title="2167.955" id=c_"2167.955">__when__</span> this happens, what I do is I'm trying to satisfy myself. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2170.845" data-end_ts="2170.925" title="2170.845" id=c_"2170.845">__Hmm__</span>. And, and you know what, I've been working pretty well so far. It's, I'm just saying, okay, you know, I got too many ideas here. It's just too much information. Right. Let me just sit down and think, what do I need? I wanna make music, what do I need to do? Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that sounds like that was the way that you would've gotten to your drum modules because Yes. Prior to the release of the drum <span style="color:red" data-ts="2192.985" data-end_ts="2193.205" title="2192.985" id=c_"2192.985">__mod__</span> modules, that was a really weak part of the modular world. There was just, there, there were not ways to effectively get what we, you know, especially those of us that are kind of obsessed with techno sound. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, there's no way to get those sounds in an efficient way. You would end up using the better part of your modular just to get a cowbell sound. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>Right. Exactly. Yes. Yes. Six oscillator in this, right. <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. <laugh>. And so, you know, it, it, it's clear that you were thinking of what, what do I need to make sound? And it actually kind of seems like your head was, you know, even if you didn't actually have the great big modular studio, seems like your head is kind of in that place. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>Yes, yes. You know, I realize that the modular is amazing, but it's not a musical instrument per se. It was mostly a noise machine for many, many years. Right. And, the system from the seventies that were left and the eighties were having serious problems of tuning. So they were unreliable, in that sense. And, you know, I was like, okay, how do you integrate this whole thing? You turn it into a music system, something that you can really, really compose. I don't want a computer next to me. Right. I want just to sit down. And again, it's not because I don't like computer, it is because I felt there's something to be explored here on that front. And, and, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2283.485" data-end_ts="2283.645" title="2283.485" id=c_"2283.485">__it__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2283.645" data-end_ts="2283.845" title="2283.645" id=c_"2283.645">__it__</span>, it was pretty, pretty easy because just as you say, you know, I was too sitting down and devoting half of my module to make a kick, but you know, when I got this kick and I got the baseline running next <span style="color:red" data-ts="2293.965" data-end_ts="2294.085" title="2293.965" id=c_"2293.965">__to__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2294.085" data-end_ts="2294.165" title="2294.085" id=c_"2294.085">__us__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2294.165" data-end_ts="2294.285" title="2294.165" id=c_"2294.165">__I__</span>, wow, that just sounds so amazing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>It, it's so tight. Right. So I was like, okay, I need to, to think about this a little more. And, you know, the 8 0 8 and the nine oh nines have been amazing sounds since ever They're classic now. So, you know, I don't need to sell it to anybody. Everybody knows what it is. And, I start looking at those schematics and I was thinking, you know, how can I adopt it into <span style="color:red" data-ts="2317.805" data-end_ts="2317.925" title="2317.805" id=c_"2317.805">__a__</span>, into a modular, you know, the voltages on the modulars are different than what's in those machines, and how can I make it work reliably? And there was some attempts before, we did it to do that, which were, you know, not that great. So that helped me too, because I could learn what can be done wrong. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>And I think we nailed it pretty well. We, we did the sounds and, you know, they sound very authentic. And, you know, it's like a side story to that is that when I designed the 8 0 8, especially the, the bass drum, I was looking for source to compare, and I got <span style="color:red" data-ts="2354.565" data-end_ts="2354.685" title="2354.565" id=c_"2354.565">__a__</span>, so I bought an 8 0 8, and I was listening to it, I was like, wow, that sounds great. And I built a circuit and it sounds different. I'm like, wait a second. So I was, you know, I contacting some friends and say, Hey, you got an 8 0 8? Yeah, yeah. Send me some samples <span style="color:red" data-ts="2367.625" data-end_ts="2367.845" title="2367.625" id=c_"2367.625">__you__</span> recorded, and that sounds different. And I was like, whoa, the hell's going on over here. And every sample I got was so different now. It wasn't, you know, I, we all know that analog, you know, sounds different. One from each other. That's, you know, that's normal. But it was just so dramatically different Yeah. That I was Okay at that time. I realized that there's just no reference out there, and the only thing I can rely on is basically the math, the math behind those circuits to analyze what, you know, the creator wanted to this to sound like. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, it's, and it's interesting because actually I think for a lot of people, like the sound of the 8 0 8 has actually kind of been bastardized because now if you <laugh>, if you hear like an 8 0 8 sound on a hip hop track, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, it's probably a sample that has been hyper <span style="color:red" data-ts="2418.325" data-end_ts="2418.965" title="2418.325" id=c_"2418.325">__compressed__</span>. Right. And hyper frequency tweaked. Yep. And then Resampled four times <laugh>, and it ended up on an M pc 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>Yeah. <laugh>, you know, and 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's played off of a digital system. Exactly. But I know what you mean about the different sounds. I actually, I've, I've owned a couple of eight oh eights over the course of my life, and I remember in one specific one, the one that I had that was most pristine, you know, it's like all, everything was beautiful. It was like a mint condition box. It was like the crummiest sounding 8 0 8 <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>Interesting. Heard. Yeah. I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>See. Sadly. You know, and it was like the one that had bounced around in someone's, in someone's trunk of their car for 10 years. That was the one that just sounded wonderful. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>And, you know, it could definitely be, it, it could be that it was exposed to heat for many, many years. Right. And or humidity or, you know, things 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Degraded in a useful way, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>You know? Absolutely. You know, so, yeah. It's fascinating. That's, that's part of the fascinating part of, you know, when you're trying to clone things from the past. Right. It's, it's something not a lot of people like to do because it's pretty challenging. But I think if you got the knowledge, if you know what you're doing, then you could do it. Right. And, I think for us, it's really paid off because it turns our system into a, into what I just described, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2497.765" data-end_ts="2497.885" title="2497.765" id=c_"2497.765">__a__</span> like a whole musical system. Sure. Something that I can compose, you know, I can compose music on it. I can sit down and hit play and, and turn the buttons and, and people ask me, okay, so how do you, how do you play this? I'm, I, I'm, I'm, this is how I play. I turned a button <laugh>, that's playing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>You know? Right. That's what means. Yeah. I, for myself doing that, you know? Yeah. So, oh, but you, there's no media controllers. I'm like, no, there's no media controllers. It's just, it is what it is. What you see is what you get. Right. So, and, and, and you know, it's like when you do something like that and you start showing it to, to people around you, and you get good reactions, especially, you know, from musician who are experienced, you know, those who have like an 8 0 8 and a 9 0 9 studio and a modular, and they try to hook it all up together, and they're so used to work their way, all of a sudden you bring them that, you know, a station 2 52, a complete tiptop system, you put it on a table and it's all integrated, and the timing is just amazing. It just, you know, like, oh, okay, okay, let me think about this. Right. And you see the reaction, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2558.445" data-end_ts="2558.645" title="2558.445" id=c_"2558.445">__and__</span> that's, that is an amazing moment. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Indeed. Well, it's interesting you mentioned it to the 2 52 because, one of the things I wanted to talk about was the fact that perhaps one of the most influential things, or some of the most influential things you've done are not things that make sound, but they're like the infrastructure pieces. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> of a modular system. And, you know, maybe it was some of the influence there was you bringing high quality to the table, right? Yeah. Because to me, your introduction of your Zeus power system Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> was the first time that I felt people were actually taking the power side of mod of Eurorack systems. Seriously. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>Yeah. Yeah. Well, you know, the thing happened, I think it was the first NAMM show. I was standing there with, with a system from, basically our modules mixed with some other manufacture modules, and I was demoing it, and people walked by and were like, blown away by the sound. Right? Yeah. And like, Hey, I, I want to get into this stuff. What do I do? And I'm kind of thinking to myself, well, you need to buy a case and you need to buy. And, and then <span style="color:red" data-ts="2634.885" data-end_ts="2634.965" title="2634.885" id=c_"2634.885">__I__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2634.965" data-end_ts="2635.045" title="2634.965" id=c_"2634.965">__was__</span> like, how much is the case? I'm like, oh, the case is like $700, and you see the sour, you know, response, right? Right. It's like, what are you selling me? Like metal here for $700 just to try this thing? Right. You know, because the thing with modular, it's very intimidating for somebody who doesn't know those cables. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>The spaghetti is just like, you really need to lower the entry level in order to encourage somebody to take the risk. And that was the moment I decided I'm going to find a solution to this problem. And, it took, you know, about <span style="color:red" data-ts="2667.725" data-end_ts="2667.845" title="2667.725" id=c_"2667.725">__a__</span>, I think almost a year of development and I create this, what we call the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2671.445" data-end_ts="2671.565" title="2671.445" id=c_"2671.445">__today__</span>, the happy ending kids. Right. And I think this is what really, you know, made <span style="color:red" data-ts="2677.405" data-end_ts="2677.525" title="2677.405" id=c_"2677.405">__u__</span> boom because all of a sudden they start selling like crazy and people could afford to try this, and a friend could tell another friend, Hey, you know, I just bought this. It cost me, you know, $149 and I put this module and check this out. This is an analog <span style="color:red" data-ts="2693.165" data-end_ts="2693.485" title="2693.165" id=c_"2693.165">__<inaudible>__</span>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2693.485" data-end_ts="2693.805" title="2693.485" id=c_"2693.485">__Listen__</span>, how, you know, you, you could get the experience for really cheap 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And Yeah, you're, you're absolutely right. The, the concept of the concept of the, the happy ending kit and the, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2706.035" data-end_ts="2706.325" title="2706.035" id=c_"2706.035">__uses__</span>, or however you would say that 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2710.585" data-end_ts="2710.805" title="2710.585" id=c_"2710.585">__You__</span> call it The micro. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The micro. There you go. I mean, that, that combination changed things for people because I, I actually started off in modulars way back in the day, with a surge system. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and with some other quite expensive systems. And believe me, you didn't, you would, you would do anything to find stuff on the used market because when you would talk to Rex about a power supply for a surge system Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, it sounded an awful lot. Like three car payments. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>Yeah, exactly. <laugh>. Exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And so, you know, I could be excited about it, and I happened to be employed well enough that I could <span style="color:red" data-ts="2749.595" data-end_ts="2749.885" title="2749.595" id=c_"2749.595">__sort__</span> of kind of afford it, but I couldn't go to my, especially like younger kids would come and they'd hear this and they'd be so excited, and they'd be like, how do I get started? Exactly. And it was like, I can't even talk about it because it'll make you cry <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>Exactly. And you know, that's me. When you say those kids, I'm looking at myself, you know, a few years ago Yeah, that's exactly me, that's me sitting there wanting to buy this stuff and couldn't even dream about it. No. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2773.605" data-end_ts="2773.765" title="2773.605" id=c_"2773.605">__Right__</span>. It was so crazy. Right. And there's no reason, you know, I'm, I'm an engineer. I'm know exactly what I'm doing, and, here you go. I, I'm, I'm alive proof that things doesn't need to be so expensive and one can still build a, a successful company around that. Sure. So, now, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now the flip side of it is the, the most expensive modular thing I own Mm-Hmm. Is something that you make, and again, it's something that doesn't make noise. It's my Station 2 52 folding case. Oh, okay. That case has changed my life, because prior to that, I had a system that required a lot of effort to, to take somewhere. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And now there's, the idea of portable systems are a little more common, but still not super common. But I'll tell you that, the ability to fold this thing up to have a well sized system, so like with the 2 52, I've got enough to really do a significant gig. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>Yes, yes, yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And, but, you know, it's, it's an expensive piece, but the engineering is phenomenal. Yes. And I'd like to hear a little bit about the creation of that. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>Well, again, you know, it came from a need. It's, and, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2852.425" data-end_ts="2852.645" title="2852.425" id=c_"2852.425">__and__</span> NAMM show again, showed up there because we were hitting the shows. And, I really wanted something that first looks nice, but it's also portable. Something I can go with to the show, open it up, you know, play and get back home, without, thinking about it too much. You know, we, we didn't invent the concept. The concept of a folding case was, invented I think by Don Bookla. Maybe somebody before him did it too, but <span style="color:red" data-ts="2881.385" data-end_ts="2881.605" title="2881.385" id=c_"2881.385">__not__</span> that I'm familiar with. And, it's, it's been something that I was thinking for some time. Okay. I like the concept, but there's things I don't like about it as well. And, then start the stage of the engineering Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And this case took also about a year of development, maybe even more. And it was very problematic, I should say. It took a lot of resources, because, I needed to work with the mechanical engineers and, I needed to do a lot of prototypes. So that's working with metal shops and, you know, those guys sometimes just don't have the time for you. They're like, you know, just take your <span style="color:red" data-ts="2923.955" data-end_ts="2924.195" title="2923.955" id=c_"2923.955">__pass__</span> and go away from here. Okay, <laugh>, I don't wanna see you anymore, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>So I had to go through a couple of those situations. But it really is a, is a phenomenal case. It's made for more than 200 components. It's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2938.555" data-end_ts="2938.675" title="2938.555" id=c_"2938.555">__a__</span>, it's a little transformer, you know, it's, it's something that just, changes shape. Right. And there's electrical, it's an electromechanical wonder. Yeah. And there's also a safety issue into it, which people usually take for granted. They don't even think about it. But, you know, one of the thing, the word meal for a long time was that, you know, it's a big thing. It's, it's, it's heavy. It can hurt somebody. And how do we make sure this doesn't happen? And, a major part of the design was to try and find a solution that, you know, kind of satisfied, at least from a legal point of view. You know, just, you know, as long as you do it right. And you can at least sleep well at night knowing that you did the best, you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Did the best you could, Ryan. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>Yes. So, yeah. But, definitely that, that was the foundation of our systems and, and our us as a, you know, okay. We are not just making modules, we're making, you know, the whole, the whole thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. It's interesting because <laugh>, when I, the first time I saw Station 2 52 was at the NAMM show. I was there and I went by the, the Analog Haven booth. Yes. And, every time I'm at the NAMM Show, I always kind of hang out with Paul Schreiber a little bit, Uhhuh <affirmative>. And I used to be a big five <span style="color:red" data-ts="3015.265" data-end_ts="3015.555" title="3015.265" id=c_"3015.265">__view__</span> user, so I had a bunch of Paul's work stuff, a lot of synthesizers.com, and I was talking to him and he was like, Hey, Darwin I'm working on these Euro <span style="color:red" data-ts="3023.415" data-end_ts="3023.635" title="3023.415" id=c_"3023.415">__rec__</span> things. I'm like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3024.275" data-end_ts="3024.475" title="3024.275" id=c_"3024.275">__oh__</span>, come on man. Get real. Right. <laugh>, you know, don't, don't go to the dark side. And he said, I'll show you why I, I'm going to do it. And he walks me around the corner and points at a 2 52 and he says, that is the future. And I looked at it and I'm like, I don't know if it's the future for everybody, but he sure is the future for me. <laugh>. So, so nothing else you can think of Paul Schreiber as being one of your salesmen out there, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b><laugh>. Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3049.105" data-end_ts="3049.325" title="3049.105" id=c_"3049.105">__No__</span>, Paul and I, we know each other for many, many years. We're good friends. He's a great guy. Yeah, for 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. So, the final piece that I wanna talk about, again, not a sound maker, but this is one where you have probably touched every modular user that I know, and that's with the stack ables. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yes. Now it looks to me like somebody who'd spent a lot of time with banana jacks. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, decided, decided to do something about wires, <laugh>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3078.105" data-end_ts="3078.325" title="3078.105" id=c_"3078.105">__Now__</span> you mentioned before that your early systems were banana jacks. Was that kind of the influence behind it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>For sure. Yeah. You see, the thing is that when, when I, was in the States and I was looking at, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3090.275" data-end_ts="3090.565" title="3090.275" id=c_"3090.275">__urac__</span>, so I bought myself some modules and I stopped playing with them, and I immediately felt like a handicap. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>You know, I was like, whoa, wait a second. How can, how can, it's impossible to work this way. And, and malt were just, just didn't cut through to me. I mean, maybe some people like it, but I, I'm sorry, not for me. Yeah. And again, it was, okay, how do I do that? And I thought it was gonna be something simple, and it turned out to be something extremely complicated, because of the size. And, the, the eurorack cables are shielded, and that's the main difference between those people think it's like banana, right? It's just a banana, like a modified banana. It's really not just a modified banana. Because, because URAC is a jack, it's not just a, you know, a banana is a slot and this is a jack, right. It's totally different mechanism. And, it requires a lot of engineering and a lot of experimentation. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>And again, been throwing out of, you know, shops, here and there, like, take those drawing and I don't wanna see you anymore, <laugh>, you know, it's happening there too. Right. But this one was something that I, I felt that I need to, I need to do. It was just, I knew that if Europe need to happen, it, this has to happen too. Right. The barrier, the biggest barrier was the investment over there. It was just massive. Especially for us back then, you know, it's, it was just a lot of money because you need to invest in molds and plastic and metal and it's, it's, it's the big guy's game. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I would imagine that doing cables, you don't go and get 500 cables. No. You have to, you have to get 10,000 or they don't <span style="color:red" data-ts="3189.525" data-end_ts="3189.765" title="3189.525" id=c_"3189.525">__wanna__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>Talk to Oh, even, even more than that. Yeah. Oh, really? Even more than that. Yeah. So I was start going, you know, I was thinking, okay, I'll be smart. I'll go to China, I will, I talk to Chinese manufacturers. And they, they didn't wanna even hear about that because the quarantine was like, I said, Hey, yeah, I need like, maybe a thousand. And they were looking like, are you crazy? And then I say, okay, 5,000. It's like, what? Just, you know, go, go away. So, and, and, you know, for them, the, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3213.045" data-end_ts="3213.245" title="3213.045" id=c_"3213.045">__the__</span> most of it is like, they like to copy stuff, so they don't wanna go through the, the stages of r and d and the investment of that. They, they want <span style="color:red" data-ts="3220.685" data-end_ts="3220.845" title="3220.685" id=c_"3220.685">__to__</span>, you know, manufacture something that is already good and successful. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That they can squirt out. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="3225.605" data-end_ts="3225.925" title="3225.605" id=c_"3225.605">__Right__</span>, exactly. So, so I realized, you know, the only way I can do it is I can do it in the United States, and I can do it with local manufacturing and, and, you know, local engineers. And, and that's how I start doing this. And then a good friend of mine say, Hey, listen, if you're gonna invest so much money, if you're gonna basically invest everything you, you earn so far with this little business you've been working on, you better protect yourself. And, he introduced me to a, a friend who's, who's a lawyer, a patent lawyer, and he says, you know, I might be, able to work with you, something on that. And, yeah, we went to the patent office and we filed up for a patent for this thing because, you know, as simple as it is, it's actually quite innovative. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. It really is. And it, it, it, but it's easy enough to copy if you don't make those protections. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>Oh, exactly. Exactly. Right. And I knew that, you know, I have to do it. So it was an extra investment on top of the investment, but it's like you, you kind of, you, you were already so deep inside of it that you have to go, you know, you kinda like, okay, whatever. I just hope it's gonna be successful. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You have to go the whole way. Right? Yep. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b><laugh> and, yeah. And then we start producing them. And I remember we were sourcing some of the components from China, and we do the manufacturing over here, and the first round worked well, but they were not that great as far as the quality. And then I realized, okay, I just don't wanna deal with, you know, stuff coming from China because it was just, you know, you order a chair and you get a table, you know? Right, right. It's totally impossible. And I remember having like spools of wire, which are so heavy and cost so much, to ship over here, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="3324.565" data-end_ts="3324.725" title="3324.565" id=c_"3324.565">__they__</span> were just the wrong gauge, or the wrong color, or the wrong material or whatever. Every time there was something. So we went through another stage of design and we adopted it to things that are made locally over here. And, you know, it's obviously, you know, 10 times the price, but the quality is, is unparalleled. Right. And it gives us peace of mind again, you know, I'm doing something and I'm doing it right. And it's, it's fresh and new and it needs to prove itself, so its, it better be done. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Well that's, that sounds like that was quite a, quite a trail, maybe a trail of tears, but, <laugh>, also it, it explains why those cables kind of, I mean, literally everybody's got 'em. Yeah. And so that's a, that's a telling, telling story as well. Our time is just about up, but there's a couple of things that I do kind of want to ask. First of all, I wanna know, you already kind of sneaked in that you've got a quantizer coming out. Is there any anything else new you might be able to, to, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b><laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Clue me in on? Just so I can start saving up my money? <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>I tell you what the problem with that, the moment I'm telling you what it is, then I'll start getting emails. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You're gonna get orders, <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>When is it ready? When is ready? And you know what, again, it reminds me of myself hitting emails <span style="color:red" data-ts="3402.625" data-end_ts="3402.845" title="3402.625" id=c_"3402.625">__to__</span> those manufacturer back in those days, and they're like, I was like, Hey, when you finish the sequence, I was like, oh, yeah, yeah, next week, next week, next week. And I remember the feeling, you know, we, because we're junkies, let's face it. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Absolutely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>You're, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You're so right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="3415.585" data-end_ts="3415.805" title="3415.585" id=c_"3415.585">__And__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3415.805" data-end_ts="3416.005" title="3415.805" id=c_"3415.805">__it's__</span> exactly the way <span style="color:red" data-ts="3416.685" data-end_ts="3416.725" title="3416.685" id=c_"3416.685">__it__</span> said <span style="color:red" data-ts="3417.065" data-end_ts="3417.285" title="3417.065" id=c_"3417.065">__as__</span>, as a, as a dealer, I need to be sure I'm, treating my, you know, my junkies, right. <laugh>. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, okay, so I'll let you off the hook of that then <laugh>. But I'm gonna hit you up with a different, a different question. Okay. And, different people have asked questions like this in different ways, and often it's sort of like something like, you know, what would you say to a 20 year old version of yourself, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But I would, I would, I want <span style="color:red" data-ts="3448.085" data-end_ts="3448.205" title="3448.085" id=c_"3448.085">__to__</span> ask you something specifically different because it seems like you've been very thoughtful about the way that you approach the things that you've take taken on. If there was a person who had a dream to do, to become an instrument builder, maybe not a modular instrument builder, but a a an instrument builder of some sort. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, what would you say are the important steps? Is it education? Is it experience? Is it working with other people? What do you think is the, are the keys to making that really, making, becoming an instrument builder is sort of like a careers stage? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>I think, you know, I believe in something that, is, is a key in life in my opinion, is that, is that everything that happens happens for the best. Because when you try to make something to craft something, you <span style="color:red" data-ts="3505.685" data-end_ts="3505.765" title="3505.685" id=c_"3505.685">__are__</span> gonna run into good days and bad days. And the bad days can really turn your craft into crap 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>And these are the moment that defines you as a person who's going to be somebody who creates stuff. It's either you can take it or you can't. And for me, the way to take it is to, when this <span style="color:red" data-ts="3525.285" data-end_ts="3525.525" title="3525.285" id=c_"3525.285">__things__</span> happen, just be able to, you know, hold it and say, okay, you know, it probably happen for the best. You know, it's, it looks terrible this moment. Everything is gonna collapse. The end of the world is coming, but it probably is a good thing. And, you know, it's very hard to think that way. But I think that once you do that, I think the gates are open because education is absolutely a must. It's not even a question. Passion is a must. Not even a question. The real question is the soul. If you can, you know, have your soul in the right place, in the right time, strong enough to go through against the waves because the waves are gonna come and they're strong. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Wow. Well, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3567.715" data-end_ts="3568.005" title="3567.715" id=c_"3567.715">__Gura__</span>, thank you so much for spending time, spending time with, with me and with my listeners. This was a fantastic, view into you as well into the work you're doing and <span style="color:red" data-ts="3580.805" data-end_ts="3580.965" title="3580.805" id=c_"3580.805">__this__</span>, the work that you're obviously passionate about. Thank you so much for 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gur: </b>That. Thank you very much. Thanks. Bye-Bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright, bye.

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, there you have it. Many thanks to Gerr for, putting himself up for the interview. It was really fantastic. I want to thank everybody for their listenership, for continuing to continue on. I've got a bunch of interviews that I completed out this week, so we should be in pretty good shape for the next few weeks. Can't wait to get 'em out there for you.
