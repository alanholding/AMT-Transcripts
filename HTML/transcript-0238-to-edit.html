<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today I get to speak to somebody that's kind of new to me. I actually feel like I know a little bit about him. His name's Abraham Ingle He runs the, the company AI Synthesis, which is a cool little DIY shop, that's making some really neat modules. The reason I feel like I kind of know him is because he recently was interviewed on the Podular Mod <span style="color:red" data-ts="37.115" data-end_ts="37.405" title="37.115" id=c_"37.115">__Cast__</span>. There'll be a link to it on the site. It's a cool little, really modular, <span style="color:red" data-ts="43.365" data-end_ts="43.845" title="43.365" id=c_"43.365">__focused__</span>, podcast. And, so while I knew of his work, preceding that, I kind of felt like I got to know a little bit about him. And so he talks there a lot about the modules and stuff, but we're gonna talk about maybe a, a broader set of things, today. So I've already talked enough. Let's, let's talk to Abraham <laugh>. Hey, Abraham. How's it going? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham Ingle: </b>Good. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I am great. Thank you so much for, taking the time to talk to me. We were actually scheduled to talk last week, but I had one of these like, pervasive internet outages that can sometimes happen, I swear. Man, it was weird. It was, I felt like after three days of no internet, we were almost back to like, pioneer days, man. <laugh>. It was like the kids started playing guitar and stuff like that. I was like, pretty soon we're gonna sit around a fire and like, talk about, you know, what things were like when we were kids. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="103.825" data-end_ts="104.245" title="103.825" id=c_"103.825">__Retail__</span> Star Wars. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's right. <laugh>. Yeah, that's right. Star Wars becomes an oral history again. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So let's start off this, this discussion by talking a little bit about, about you and your work. Why don't you fill in the listeners a little bit about what AI Synthesis is all about? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>Yes. AI Synthesis is my little company. It's basically the company that I wish existed back when I was getting obsessed with modular synths in the late nineties. At that time it was very limited what was out there. You had dope <span style="color:red" data-ts="139.225" data-end_ts="139.445" title="139.225" id=c_"139.225">__fur__</span>, and probably some other DIY companies operating, but the level of entry was really, really high and complicated. And I had these really old, books that I was getting from the Evergreen State Library about, you know, how to build a synth. And, you know, all the parts were wildly outdated and there was no way to, to actually do it. So I was just dreaming at that time. But I started getting interested in, in DIY and modular synths and all that. But it wasn't until many, many years later that, the opportunity fell in my lap to really take a risk and, and get into it. And then once I did and circuits worked, I said, oh man, this is amazing. And I've, I've gotta share this with people. So, so I made a business to help do that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. And it's a, it's a really cool business because in addition to making modules, you actually go out of your way to be a bit of an educator. The way that you do your build instructions are like clear as day. It, it leaves a very little room for interpretation. You just make it so that it's really clear what you're doing and, it puts people in a position to have a high likelihood of success. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>Yeah. And I mean, that's, that's two part one, there's nothing better than when a module turns on after you build it or any, anything you build. Like if, if you don't have to do any troubleshooting, that just feels amazing. Right. So I definitely want that. Two, it, it cuts down on the support, which is great. And then, you know, three, I, I'm self-taught. I don't have any EE or anything like that. So, you know, there's always, when you're self-taught at anything, there's always weird little nooks and crannies of, of knowledge that you have missing because you kind of cheated your way there by doing instead of reading First <laugh>. And so, you know, a lot of the times, and I, I go back and forth on like, how much is too much, but I'll try, especially on the early modules, like the, the Mixer for instance, of like saying, you know, these are your input resistors and this is why they're there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>Right. And that not only gives the builder a little bit of knowledge as to why they're doing this, because other than that it's just Legos for adults. But it also forces me to, you know, dig into my own circuits where, you know, if I was doing this for just myself, I'd be happy once they worked. But since other people are building them, I want to take that extra step and, and say, you know, this is kind of why it works too. Although I, I don't go too heavy on that in the Build Guide. 'cause otherwise the Build Guide would, would be eight pages long and, you know, only takes an hour to build the thing. So <laugh>, it's a, it's a, it's a balance. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What you say though is that, that this kind of like, that the perspective that you have from being self-taught kind of informs you about the kind of things that you can help people out with. One of the things that I actually really love and, and the thing that I wish would've been around when I first started messing around with circuits, is your list of, Hey, go buy these tools and sort of like pointers to which exact ones to buy. Yeah. I can't tell you the number of like stupid purchases I made, either tools that I bought 'cause they seemed like they'd be a good idea and were never used. Or conversely the, you know, the wire stripper from hell that I, I saved 45 cents on and didn't work a wit. You know, so I have to say that stuff like that ends up being like super informative to people that are just getting their feet on the ground. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>Yeah. Thank you. That's, I I definitely hope it does that. It's that, that stuff and the articles that I put up in the, I think it's called DIY guide section, right? Where I just put up guides that have nothing, usually nothing to do with my product. A lot of that stuff is just, I'll get, you know, I'll be on, on a forum or on, although I'm on their, I'm on everything less these days 'cause I'm on a diet, social media diet. But, you know, I would be in a place where, people who are trying to learn common, you know, you see the same questions every week, you know? Right. And it's the exact same question. So I was like, Hey, I'm just gonna write it once and then I can link to it. Sure. And then, you know, if you learn something, then maybe you think I'm a nice guy and that's good for my brand, and then everyone learns something and everyone's happy. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>So, yeah. I mean, I, I was also thinking when I started the business, like it's a, it's a weird mission slash business because there, even though I'm trying to make it as easy as possible, there is still, I know a perceived very high barrier of entry. So it's just about like, where can I knock those down? Like, oh, the tools, it's a thing. Well, okay, here's the tools. Oh, what about this? Well, here's this. So, you know, if I can check all those boxes, then I can get people who've never built anything to build things. And that's super empowering. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It is. Well, the other thing I noticed is that you actually do a lot of sort of practical stuff. I was, I was kind of surprised because like your discussion about hey, get a soldering iron, you know, it has like get a nice one and I look and sure enough, it's that nice weller that, I love so much. Right? Yep. But then also you have, or get a cheap one and you go and you have a pointer to a $13 one, which is great because the fact of the matter is not everybody is in a financial position to say, okay, I'm gonna dump a hundred bucks on something that I'm not even sure that I'm gonna like. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>Right. Especially with DIY because most of the time, I mean, the way I started in was as a way to save money. Right. So, you know, you're, if you're, if you're just saying buy the, the best thing, it's like, well yeah, you know, I've been doing DIY for for years and years and I like the Weller and it's great. And I think if you are gonna do a lot of DIY you should get that Weller 'cause you'll love it. Right. But, you know, if you're just starting off and you're like, well, I'm broke and really I just wanted to make a guitar pedal for cheaper than I could buy it for, then it's like, yeah, buy the $13 one. It'll frustrate you sometimes, but you can get the job done. And, and if you do more stuff, then you can upgrade. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. And throwing away that 13 bucks isn't gonna kill you at that point. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>No, no. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So, I'm a little curious because you dropped a nugget there that I think think is really important, which is that you got into the DIY and, and actually the whole modular market thing, you got into it not because it looked like a marketplace, but because you were broke and you wanted a modular synth. And I'm kind of curious because that is, that's an interesting combination. <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b><laugh>, it's a, it's a very common combination. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, it is. It seems that way. <laugh>, but also, I mean, what is it about, I mean, you got into it before modular was a thing. I think some of the reason why that's a common thing now is because people see a lot of artists using modular systems and are like, Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Oh man, I gotta do that. Right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But if you got started in late nineties, that was a very different time. Modular was sort of like, kind of dead and buried and was just starting to come back around. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>Yeah. You just had the early seeds of dope fur and then, <span style="color:red" data-ts="597.275" data-end_ts="597.565" title="597.275" id=c_"597.275">__some__</span> of the ugliest websites you've ever seen. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, and Syntech started showing up. Yeah. I was working with Grant Richter on the Wired system at the time, and that was just starting to kind of come online. But man, I remember em did a thing like, Hey, modulars are kind of coming back and, you know, it was like a two page article because there wasn't that much to talk about, you know? Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>Yeah. I mean, I was going to college at the time and, at least at the time, evergreen had, some ULAs and some Arp 26 hundreds. Ah. And you know, the late nineties musically was a time when, when Analog as a sound was, was coming back and you had, I mean, stereo lab and air French band and, you know, a bunch of other, you know, chemical Brothers were like, we use analog synths. And they had been pretty much gone too, just in general in the nineties. Like there weren't a lot of 'em. And then you start to see the VAs and now, you know, analogs are everywhere. So yeah, I was just obsessed with, with analog synths. I had a Juno, 60 at the time, and like an eliss and I was just constantly, I was also a guitar player, a failed guitar player. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>So, you know, it started with pedals. I think it starts with pedals for a lot of us. And, you know, I was just obsessed with like, oh, you know, what if this pedal had like a, this knob or what if I can control this? Or what if I could sync up all of these rates on my pedal board and, but still have it be, you know, analog pedals or, or interesting pedals, and not just like a one big huge multi effect box and stuff like that. Like, how do I not dive through menus and just have the hands-on control that I wanted? Yeah. That's when I became obsessed. But I didn't actually get a modular until, I think it was 20, 20 11 or 13 or something in there was actually when I got my first modular. Oh, wow. Yeah. I, I'd never had one. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>I had had a couple semi modular pieces, but my early DIY days were, were pretty stunted because, I didn't have the level of education that was needed to be able to take advantage of the resources that were there at the time. Oh, okay. And, I was also, building pretty much everything on Perfboard that I would get from Radio Shack. And, what I later learned when I bought my modular is that I'm just really bad at Perfboard <laugh> and I can't, it's true. I, even now, when I, when I prototype, I never use Perfboard because I'm terrible at it. Everything I build on Perfboard either doesn't work or works for a little bit and then it breaks. Yeah. Say, say that what you will about my soldiering technique maybe, all I know is me and Perfboard don't get along. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>So a lot of my early trial and errors were, were pretty errors. And even when they worked tonight, you know, I'd build simple little oscillators or like lunetta circuits, like, oh, this is cool. And then, you know, one day it just wouldn't work. And I'd put it in a box full of repair stuff that would never get touched and actually stopped doing any DIY for a number of years. And then I bought, this guy, this kind of dad guy, he had a bunch of kids was selling his, no <span style="color:red" data-ts="797.925" data-end_ts="798.285" title="797.925" id=c_"797.925">__format__</span> modular synthesizer that he had built out of like various metal panels, that he got for free from his work. And they were all, music from outer space circuits. Oh, okay. Which is still a great circuit Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="810.565" data-end_ts="810.765" title="810.565" id=c_"810.565">__Rest__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="810.765" data-end_ts="810.885" title="810.765" id=c_"810.765">__a__</span> peace ray. And so they were all those circuits, just put into these weird panels. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>And he was selling not only his modular, which was, in like 75 to 90% working order, but he was also selling his, like his hobby, his electronics hobby. So when I bought that synthesizer, I also bought parts. I bought, some circuit boards. I bought a bunch of stuff came with it. I think it had probably some wire strippers and some probably some cutters. And I, it might have had a soldering iron, although I don't think so. 'cause I think I ended up buying the iron. But, suddenly I, I had a bunch of parts and I had a, a <span style="color:red" data-ts="857.495" data-end_ts="857.845" title="857.495" id=c_"857.495">__Music__</span> from Matter Space <span style="color:red" data-ts="858.745" data-end_ts="858.965" title="858.745" id=c_"858.745">__Way__</span> Freaker PCV, that had never been used before <laugh>. And I thought, screw it. I'm gonna, you know, buy a soldering and give this a shot. And then it worked. And I was like, oh, wow. That's the first, like, I just built a module. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>That's crazy. And then I went through and started fixing up the other modules that that came with the system and then gradually transferred those into nice bride <span style="color:red" data-ts="883.085" data-end_ts="883.365" title="883.085" id=c_"883.085">__chamber__</span> boards with, I think <span style="color:red" data-ts="884.545" data-end_ts="884.765" title="884.545" id=c_"884.545">__are__</span> at synth <span style="color:red" data-ts="885.125" data-end_ts="885.325" title="885.125" id=c_"885.125">__cube__</span> now. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So that, it looked like a really nice five U setup, and I still have it. And I actually have quite a big five u setup up in addition to your rack. And the great thing about mfo s is that it's 12 volts, so it all works with your U Rack system on the same power supply. Oh, sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, yeah. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>That's, that's when it started. And then once I learned how easy, how, like that I could actually build a thing. And at this point I, I was not really any, I don't think much more skilled than any beginner. Like, I had some experience, but not much. And a lot of that experience was frustrating and half failures. So at that point, I, I started doing this Build three Cell two thing. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, which I have somewhere in my DIY guides thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. You talk about it on, on the site. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>Yeah. And I mean, I, I literally, like, sometimes people say, oh, I wanna get into <span style="color:red" data-ts="936.245" data-end_ts="936.645" title="936.245" id=c_"936.245">__DIY__</span> and some people say, oh, you know, you wouldn't actually save any money with DIYI, I actually made quite a bit of money on DIY just at that time without running a business, per se. I would just make some modules and keep one and sell the other two and get that profit. And the Apollo I'm recording in today was bought using that money Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And then after I did that, I was just getting so obsessed with building and, and like, oh, I should write a better guide to how to build this thing because this thing is, is great, but it's a, it's not a good guide. And like, it's so frustrating and it required eight emails because these parts were wrong. And, and it just kind of started surfacing like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="975.345" data-end_ts="975.565" title="975.345" id=c_"975.345">__oh__</span>, I should, I think I should start a business. And, and I did. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. It's, this idea of, of, in the way you sit, talk about it on your site is like, build three Cell two 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative>, it's that, that literally was, was sort of like your nascent business plan to get started. But it's interesting you didn't, again, you didn't start because you were a builder. You started because you're a musician. Do you still play out? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>Oh, yeah. I, I haven't played out in a little bit because we just moved, but 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm in the same spot, by the way. There's something about relocation that'll really screw with your playing schedule. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It really does. I mean, I still actually, like this weekend, like right now, I only have two of my modular racks hooked up, and 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>There's another one over there. But yeah, I, I make music as, force damage.com. Oh, okay. Or I make music as force damage. It's at force damage.com. That's silly. But yeah, free albums on band camp and stuff. Yeah, I still absolutely make music. I make, a ton of music That's, one rule I had, because having been a, a builder for a long time, before I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1048.505" data-end_ts="1048.725" title="1048.505" id=c_"1048.505">__had__</span> a long time, like four years before I started the business, I, you would kind of see a life cycle that happens a lot where people start a business, they put out some circuits, some cool circuits, and then after a year or two or more, they stopped doing the DIY part because, there's too much support or Right. It's honestly kind of a lot easier too, just to make some prefab boards and just, you know, do the shipping stuff and, and people say, oh, you know, I, I gotta make music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>So that's one rule I I made for myself was like, I could always stop doing business and, and make music. You know, I have time to ship orders, so I could do that part, but, you know, people are always hounding me like, when's this module coming out? When's this module coming out? <laugh>? And, you know, it'll come out when it comes out, but, you know, right. I don't, if I end up not making music because I feel an obligation to put out a module, then that then I haven't really succeeded. Right. And, and I've failed. So I, I definitely need to keep that, that part alive. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I think especially you, you got a chance to be a little bit on the front lines because you saw, you know, especially coming from the five U world, you, you would've seen some people, literally take that track of like starting off as kit builders and like all of a sudden the kit thing gets to be hard. You know, I think an awful lot of people in the early two thousands really got into synth and synth DIY stuff based off of synth <span style="color:red" data-ts="1138.525" data-end_ts="1138.725" title="1138.525" id=c_"1138.525">__tech__</span> and the, the modem, which was originally <span style="color:red" data-ts="1141.365" data-end_ts="1141.765" title="1141.365" id=c_"1141.365">__module__</span> of the month club stuff. Right? Yep. And that was really, that was an important part of the process. But, you know, Paul just hit the wall of being like, you know, bagging resistors got to be something that he couldn't, he just couldn't handle doing anymore. What is it that you do that allows that to remain sort of still a bit of joy for you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>One, I think is staying a little bit small uhhuh, so that it doesn't take over my life. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>I think that's a part of it, but honestly, another part of it is, so I say I'm on a social media diet. That is totally true with the exception of Instagram. Because Instagram, and I'm super late to Instagram <laugh>. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So I'm, I'm very like old man about Instagram <laugh> because it, I was the, I I was such a late adopter. 'cause I'm like, I've just, I, I don't use any social media. I don't like any social media. I'm certainly not gonna use Instagram. And then I got on it and I can see people tagging me or my company AI synthesis, which is, they're my initials. It's me. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. You talk smack about my company, you talk smack about me <laugh>. But, you know, they tag me and they post up their, their little jams. And it's amazing because it's, it's like, oh, you know, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>Yesterday when I went into the studio, I, I made garbage, but yesterday when he went in, he made something great and he made it with like, my stuff. That's awesome. And that is such a completely amazing feeling, and experience. And it's like, I never thought that that would even be a part of it when I started this, but that actually keeps me going in a huge way because it's just amazing to see people, make things with, you know, something they made that is your, your thing that you've helped put in the world. It's just really cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right now when people talk about there being a lot of sort of like, support involved in the DIY world, what, what does that realistically mean for you? Does that mean like every night you have to sit down and answer a whole ton of email? Or is it like once in a while people are a little confused or they have something that doesn't work and they wanna ship it to you? I, what does that look like in the DIY world? I mean, in, in the commercial thing, it's like I get a module, it doesn't work, I send it back to somebody and then I shit on them all over social media. Right. <laugh>, that's, that's the process. Right. It's a well understood process. Yeah. What's that like in DIY? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>So luckily not too much shitting on me on social media <laugh>, which is nice. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That is nice. Although you're on a social media diet, so how would you know <laugh>? Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>Yeah. Either way, don't do it or it's my feelings <laugh>. But, you know, so I, I do get, I, it's not every day. It's definitely not every day that might change my outlook, but I mean, so again, part of designing the circuits and having the guides is like it, there are all the things that I got annoyed with when I was building beforehand. They're, it's all kind of tried to be fixed. So I don't, I, I'm pretty sure I get less support than your average DIY company as far as requests go. When I do get a request, I listen to what they say, and I usually ask for high res, pictures of the front and back of each board. There's never any wiring on any of my designs because I hate wiring. Right. And it's where most of the errors happen. So taking out wiring it, it means that I can look at something visually and, you know, usually spot like, oh, that looks like a cold <span style="color:red" data-ts="1376.845" data-end_ts="1377.085" title="1376.845" id=c_"1376.845">__solar__</span> joint over there, or this might be the wrong part. Double check this and try and figure it out that way. And that works a lot with usually not too much needed in between. If that doesn't work. I have a secret, are you familiar with bico modules? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, yeah. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>So they have a product or an offering called the, I believe it's called the Happy Ending Kit. Yeah. Where basically it's you <span style="color:red" data-ts="1405.435" data-end_ts="1405.725" title="1405.435" id=c_"1405.435">__play__</span>, pay a flat fee and ship your module to them and they fix it and send it back to you. Okay. I have that, but it's a secret <laugh>, ah, meaning it's, it's just not on my site. So I don't ever wanna leave anyone behind and it takes me an hour to build anything. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So, and I've actually only had to do that twice now over the two years. Usually we are able to sort it out in one or two emails, but if I can't explain what's going on, or, if, sometimes there's a language barrier because, , right. Via thunk, I sell a lot to Europe these days. Right. So sometimes there's just a language barrier and I just can't figure it out, you know, from what they're saying. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>I'll just, I shouldn't say this <laugh> in the case of Europe, I'll just be like, keep your <span style="color:red" data-ts="1449.965" data-end_ts="1450.125" title="1449.965" id=c_"1449.965">__module__</span>. I'm gonna send you a new one, <laugh>. Oh, right. And then they end up with two <laugh>. And, and in, in the states, I'll usually have them send it to me. Right. But I'm, I'm trying to figure out how to normalize that as a product and put it on the site because I, I think it's probably a good thing to market and, and tell people about. But I haven't figured out a good way to police the costs or whatever, because obviously I don't want people buying, you know, the cheap version, which would be like a PCB or a PCB in a panel. Right. And then, you know, and then getting a deal to have me build it for them when, you know, I offer built and tested modules. So if that's all people want, I want them to buy that. I don't want them to, to be sneaky about it. So I'm, I'm still trying to figure out how to figure that out, but we do that too. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Interesting. So in addition to making circuit boards and selling them and sending stuff around the world and helping people get their builds made, Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> you also are having to do the design work and building a module is one thing. Designing is another. And, you know, I had a little experience designing some circuits, mainly behind doing the hardcore, system. Yeah. And it was a fascinating process to go through, and it was very rewarding to do it. But at the same time, I really needed some people to help. And I remember like, you know, that was still when I was getting along with Grant Richter, and I would call in and I'd be like, man, you know, I, I finally figured out how op <span style="color:red" data-ts="1550.725" data-end_ts="1550.925" title="1550.725" id=c_"1550.725">__apps__</span> work, but you know, I can use any com. You know, resistors are just a ratio and I can use any resistors. How do I know what to use? And I remember him saying, you know, use a thousand and if a thousand doesn't work, use 10,000 <laugh> <laugh> and start off with that. Right. And I was like, what a brilliant, like, one sentence way of talking about how you start the process of doing some design, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, who are, who are some of the people that have that helped you out in the process of learning to become a designer? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>Yeah. So two big ones. First one is a guy named Charlie who blogs as, Charlie TROs, and I think he's got like TROs blogspot.com. And he actually was, initially going to be my business partner. He was gonna be the business partner as the brains behind it, because he is an EE and he does go to school for that, and he can design circuits, if I think of a thing. But then that, didn't work out. We still have a good relationship. He just didn't want to go into business. Got it in modules. So it's like, okay, cool. So then I had to do it myself. The second person is <span style="color:red" data-ts="1627.005" data-end_ts="1627.125" title="1627.005" id=c_"1627.005">__a__</span> person, I call him my mentor. I'm not sure if he would <laugh> go reverse, but that's, Dave Brown of modular synthesis.com. He is, brilliant, man and a good man. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>And he, if I'm ever super stuck, he will help me figure out why, this PCB doesn't work for me. The hardest part is the, the PCB design, uhhuh <affirmative>, because it's through hole. I would love to do more SMT stuff, but it's, there's various reasons why I don't, there's kind of like an age thing about it, right. Where like, it's super easy for young people, and I, and for most people, like most people should not be afraid of, of most SM D <span style="color:red" data-ts="1674.685" data-end_ts="1674.805" title="1674.685" id=c_"1674.685">__or__</span> SMT work, as long as it's that kind of larger size, right. You, you probably will have a, a high degree of success, but you know, a lot, a lot of people who are a little bit older, really, they actually can't do it. They, their hands move too much. And, so anyway, and also it, it scares new people, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>So, so it's kind of against my whole, I don't wanna say brand, but essentially, so through whole PCB is really hard because you're drilling through it all the time instead of just laying stuff on top of it. So, so that's what's really complicated, and it takes a huge, what I call brain ram, which is just, you know, the, if you put down a PCB design project for a week and then try and come back to it, like good luck, right? Because you <span style="color:red" data-ts="1719.165" data-end_ts="1719.325" title="1719.165" id=c_"1719.165">__had__</span>, you know, I keep a lot of notes, a lot, a lot of notes, but still, I would still, like, I guarantee that PCB won't work when I get it back. And you can, you can pass all the checks you want. It just, I know that it won't work because there's just a bunch of little things to remember, like, label this, do this flip, flip these caps, or else the PCBs won't fit together, right? Because with, with through <span style="color:red" data-ts="1740.525" data-end_ts="1740.725" title="1740.525" id=c_"1740.525">__hole__</span>, you're probably gonna have to do a sandwich, two boards stuck together. So anyway, the short answer to your question, <laugh> is Dave Brown. And, Charlie at this point, I rely on that less. I've gotten a lot better at utilizing the kind of building blocks that are used in modules, inverters, and op amps, and how to put those together to, to do what I want. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's interesting though, because, I mean, the other thing is there's, there's sort of like another weird process, which involves part selection. So it's one thing for like, help with design, and a lot of times that's people, right? Yeah. You get people that can help you with things like, Hey, use a thousand and if that doesn't work, use 10,000. Right? Right. But the other thing is, there's, there's kind of the weird world of part selection. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1794.235" data-end_ts="1794.525" title="1794.235" id=c_"1794.235">__Yeah__</span>. And I think when as a DIY builder, when you get a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1798.925" data-end_ts="1799.085" title="1798.925" id=c_"1798.925">__kid__</span>, it's like, oh, this is just a couple of resistors in these four chips who, who couldn't do this? Right. Well, the fact of the matter is, unless you're just doing exactly what everyone else did, even like finding the right chip to do the thing can actually be kind of a blistering process. Right. I remember, like, again, for the art <span style="color:red" data-ts="1820.285" data-end_ts="1820.485" title="1820.285" id=c_"1820.285">__core__</span> thing, finding a DAC that would, do what I wanted it to at the speed that I wanted it to Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, it was a really ugly situation. And, and all of a sudden then you're in that whole thing of like, well, not only do I have to like know how to get the data sheets for these chips, I have to know how to read 'em and how to look at the, like, example circuits and make fricking heads or tails out of any of it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>Exactly. One thing that Dave Brown, says a lot, which I think is really important to understand about design, electronic design and PCB design, is that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1857.765" data-end_ts="1857.885" title="1857.765" id=c_"1857.765">__a__</span>, a schematic is only a concept, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>It's not a board. And when you actually have a board, there's a lot of other things involved that have nothing to do with what resistors go into, what inputs it's about. Is there proper spacing for this, or is there too much tension on a capacitor because the, the widths aren't right. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, are the numberings Correct? Like, there's, there's so much stuff, like you say, with that part selection, you know, it's, it's translating a notion into the real world and like, yeah, okay, it's an op amp <span style="color:red" data-ts="1891.245" data-end_ts="1891.445" title="1891.245" id=c_"1891.245">__in__</span> some resistors. Why did I buy this kit? Well go to Mauser and see how many T <span style="color:red" data-ts="1896.065" data-end_ts="1896.285" title="1896.065" id=c_"1896.065">__oh__</span> seven twos there are <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>Which one do you wanna buy? Tell me which one is right. You know? Right. It's, it, it is daunting for a, a new person to do that. I, I do encourage the sourcing of one knowns parts, and we always link to, you know, the exact part to buy in the bombs of the build guide so that, you know, it's fairly easy to source your own parts. And I try to, like, I haven't done anything with vls yet, for instance, because I know that that's just gonna be a headache for 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>People Yeah. Sourcing headache, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>Yeah. So like, there's a lot of things that I probably won't ever put out just because it's hard to source those parts. And if I can't, you know, if I can't help you get them at, you know, in one or two orders, then, you know, I try for one order for one shopping cart. So I, I try to make it so you, someone can get everything from tdo because mm-Hmm. <affirmative> the parts are inexpensive. And for DIY, for what we're doing, you know, it's, it's a fairly non, I know it's audio and it's precious, but it, they actually are fairly non-critical operations when we're talking about analog, you know, analog mixers and stuff. So, and they're 1% resistors are just as good as any other. So, you know, I try to make everything with one shopping cart, but if you get into some of these builds, I was looking at a module, someone's like, Hey, you should build, you know, a version of this. And I looked at it and had a bunch of, bunch of different rals, some hard to find ics, and I was like, absolutely not. No way. 'cause for me to try and build kits, like, you know, trying to build, trying to get a hundred, 200 of those in quantity together is gonna be a nightmare. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, I was kinda looking over your guides and, and you actually use, you know, real common parts. So you're probably not in the unfortunate position of some where, where you're gonna end up having to like, discontinue products because the, the parts are unavailable. I mean, you use some really straightforward stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>Yeah, I try. I mean, I, I try to make it so that, you know, you know, if you've been doing it a couple years, you can probably build a mixer out of what you have laying around. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, yeah, I don't, hunting down esoteric parts is a nightmare. And, you know, getting a weird chip from eBay and then your module doesn't work and you don't know if it's because you did something wrong, or if, because you have a counterfeit chip, that's not fun <laugh>. And I don't want anyone to have to deal with that because it's, it's just too confusing. Who knows what to do in that situation right 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, you start, you talk on your site and, and you've mentioned before that you actually started off in the large format, the five u, style Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> systems. And in fact, that's still kind of the format that you love. And, and I understand that. I had a, my, my start was in five UI had a really nice combo unit. I had some, I had a lot of.com, but I also had a fair amount of moon modular. Oh <span style="color:red" data-ts="2076.405" data-end_ts="2076.485" title="2076.405" id=c_"2076.405">__yeah__</span>. I had a bunch of moon, moon modular stuff and a little of the, club of the Knob stuff. I, and I loved it, but it also was like the size of a trailer house. So, when I made a move, I also had to pare down and I went down to a much smaller Euro <span style="color:red" data-ts="2094.755" data-end_ts="2095.045" title="2094.755" id=c_"2094.755">__base__</span> system. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But I kind of missed that because there was sort of a, there was a physicality in using it that I really loved, but also when I was doing some design work on those systems, the, the level to which, the level to which Roger Eric described his part selection, you know, this is exactly the connector I use for all power supplies, and this is exactly, you know, what my output circuits use and stuff like that was really helpful to me getting started. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I mean, so when you started this thing, why did you choose to support Euro rather than trying to, trying to do five U stuff? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>So I actually wanted 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And want 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>To do both. I started with Euro as kind of a test of the business. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, because I knew and know that the market for Euro <span style="color:red" data-ts="2154.545" data-end_ts="2154.765" title="2154.545" id=c_"2154.545">__is__</span> probably 10 times the market for five U probably. Right. So I didn't want to, I wanted to do quote unquote the easy one first. <laugh>. And Euro Euro is a lot easier. There is, I mean, I, I live in Portland, the land of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2170.795" data-end_ts="2171.085" title="2170.795" id=c_"2170.795">__URAC__</span> manufacturers. Yeah. And every time you go to a bar, you meet one of your buddies who runs another business <laugh>. So, you know, it was very easy for me to, you know, get to the same panel makers that make panels for, you know, Intelli gel and, and the big guys because, you know, I want it, I want things to look nice. Like I come from Five U where things look nice. Right. So it, it was a little easier to enter that. There were like some kind of questions that were answered, like, jacks use these jacks, intelli design them, you know, do this, do that. The panels are just a piece of aluminum that's very easy when you compare that to, you know, a MOG format or mu format panel. Right. Right. Where suddenly you've got the things. And that's actually been the biggest hindrance because my, most of my system, I do have some 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Mu stuff. My live 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>Rack has two rows of MOTM and two rows of Euro, and most of my 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Modular racks follow that format with one or two rows of five view, and then a couple rows of Euro, just hanging out side by side, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>You know, MOTM, it's fairly easy to design for that. It's a, it's a piece of metal that is black and then screenprinted <laugh>. Right. So you can do that. But then, you know, when I look at trying to, trying to do the mu stuff, now that is a real, that ends up being a real concern because, you know, it's not really worth it for me to do a run of anything less than a hundred. And I look at the cost of getting, you know, those nice panels with the bent sides made for like, let's say my mixer or a molt. It's like, well, geez, how much are we gonna have to charge for that mixer? And 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Suddenly it's, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>It's not that appealing to do it. And there's also the fact that there's quarter inch inputs, which means even if I want to cut down on the wiring, I still need to use two PCBs. And then there's still sub wiring between the, you know, so it's just blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And it goes on and on and on. So I chose Euro simple answers. I chose it because if it, if the business was gonna fail, I wanted to have it fail on the proper terms. And, the second one was, it was just easier. And I would love to, I would really, really, really love to, to offer mu panels or have someone offer them for me, but I'm just not, I don't have enough faith in it yet. Maybe if I, if I just did like the higher end modules, like the filter or the looping A DSR, like that might work better because the pricing would be more in line. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>But I I do agree with you. It is a wonderful format. It does. I don't like eighth inch plugs. I use a ton of euro. I, I think they're silly <laugh>. Because I've plug <span style="color:red" data-ts="2335.405" data-end_ts="2335.565" title="2335.405" id=c_"2335.405">__in__</span> quarter inch right next to it, and I love quarter inch jacks. They have a wonderful form factor. They have a wonderful feel like ergonomics to me is so important. And it's one of the things that has really gone away in the internet age. It's, it's, but you know, like the feel of an instrument when you play it Yeah. Is so critically important to affecting your inspiration and your dreams, which is what fuels your inspiration. If you look at a panel, I'm looking at my five <span style="color:red" data-ts="2367.125" data-end_ts="2367.245" title="2367.125" id=c_"2367.125">__B__</span> system right now, and like, it's beautiful. I can just see my hand <span style="color:red" data-ts="2371.705" data-end_ts="2371.925" title="2371.705" id=c_"2371.705">__is__</span> turning that big old fbu knob and it, I can't wait to do it. And you look at like some Euro panels, which are just tons of those little tiny black knobs all stuck as close together as they can. You're like, I don't even wanna touch that thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, and, and especially you do live performance, especially in live performance, that that kind of stuff ends up translating into a kind of perform <span style="color:red" data-ts="2396.885" data-end_ts="2397.245" title="2396.885" id=c_"2396.885">__ability__</span> and, and your desire to perform with the thing too. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>Yeah, absolutely. I mean, and there's technically, technically, and this is such a small technically asterisk, asterisk, asterisk <laugh>, you know, you technically bet get better headroom out 15 volts than you do outta 12. But yeah, I mean, absolutely like the, the performance factor. Like, you know, whenever people see pics of my set of like oh five UAKA way too big and not, not portable, and I'm always like, drummers carry so much more than this to every single gig <laugh>. Great point. Every that's a single gig. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's a great point. That is a great point. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>Yeah. It's not heavy. It's still just a, a metal face plate and some PCBs like it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2436.205" data-end_ts="2436.285" title="2436.205" id=c_"2436.205">__light__</span>. Right. And I love playing with it, in my live sets, and I'll, I, I'll probably never not have five <span style="color:red" data-ts="2442.485" data-end_ts="2442.645" title="2442.485" id=c_"2442.485">__you__</span> in there because the, with that bigger knob, you just have a larger throw distance, you know, to get from zero to a hundred. Yeah. And, and it's great to, to feel like you have that control, even though, you know, the knobs still turning the same resistance, you're taking longer to get there. And it, I don't know, there is something about the larger knobs that just feels great. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and the other thing is though, I mean, it's, it is your instrument. And, you know, I always think of guitarists. You, you go and see a guitarist, and unless they're just playing a bog standard, you know, Strat or Les <span style="color:red" data-ts="2478.155" data-end_ts="2478.445" title="2478.155" id=c_"2478.155">__Paul__</span>, a lot of times, you know, they'll have, you know, they'll pick up their acoustic and it's some weirdo thing, or they'll have like an old Gretch guitar, you know, with gold Leaf on it or something, and you're like, why the hell do you need that? Why don't you just pull out a cheap Strat that you can replace tomorrow if you need to? Right. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And the answer is because it's the instrument, and sometimes the instrument inspires, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>Yeah, absolutely. I mean, it better. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Right, right. Or else you maybe pick the wrong instrument. Right. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>Exactly. I mean, that, that's what's, you know, with like, when you talk about, you know, wow, actually I won't go there, but, there are a lot of mass marketed things that come out. Some of them are reproductions Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and, you know, other things. And I check 'em out and I, I touch 'em and I'm like, this, these faders feel bad to me. Yeah. Like, I don't, I don't know, like, like if I, if I were mixing through this, I don't know, like something in the back of my mind, my reptile brain would feel how these faders feel, and I would start to mentally denigrate the quality of what I was doing. Oh yeah. Just because, you know, it's, and you know, you can do amazing things with all kinds of gear. So you're doing the right thing. Whoever you are using whatever you're doing, keep doing it. <laugh> out there, all the angry emails I'm about to get, <laugh>, I, I support you in all of your musical endeavors and I encourage you to chase your dreams. But, yeah. You know, I mean, it, the, the gear you use does matter so much, and it's regardless of the features, like features are to me, are so unimportant. You know, something with very few features that sounds good and feels good to use is something I'll always go towards then something that feels cheap and I have to dive through a bunch of menus. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. Indeed. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>I have an ambica in front of me, and I also have a Juno six behind me <laugh>. So same feature set, six voice, you know, analog one has analog os that are digitally controlled. I know the other is digital, honestly, I get it. But the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2614.805" data-end_ts="2615.085" title="2614.805" id=c_"2614.805">__MBKA__</span> has such a huge feature set compared to that Juno. Right. Massive feature set. But the filter is based off the same circuit. Uhhuh <affirmative>, which one do I play? Right. The Juno every time. Yeah. Come on. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>It doesn't even have midi. I still play it all the time. Way more than the Amica. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, it's, I mean it's the thing, again, it doesn't have to make logical sense. And, and it's why whenever I look back at like, big mistakes I made in instrument purchases, it's always because I purchased the instrument based off of like a spreadsheet that I put together. Right. <laugh>. Yeah. One that like says, well, this one has six oscillators, so surely it's better. Right, exactly. That's always like a good indicator that I'm about to like, waste my money <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>Right. So I mean, we look at the Beatles, you know, whether like you, you like The Beatles or not, their instruments had very few features. Right. It sounded very, very good. Yeah. Indeed. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="2672.885" data-end_ts="2673.045" title="2672.885" id=c_"2672.885">__if__</span>, when I look at those mixers, I've never touched one of those mixers, but boy, I would like to. 
</p>

<p>

<b>Abraham: </b>So, you know, would I get sick that I only have four channels? Maybe <laugh>, but it sure is beautiful looking. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Indeed. Indeed. Well, hey man, our time is, I can't believe we already blew through all the time. But before I let you go, I'm kind of, I'm curious about one thing. So right at this top, you said one of the things that you did when you put AI synthesis together is you wanted to make the company that you wish exist, that you wished for when you were getting started. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So I'm curious, what's something that you haven't done yet that you really want to do in order to further that dream? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>I don't know. I get a lot of really heartwarming emails, from people who I, I was their first DIY experience. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So from that perspective, I would say I'm living the dream because every time I get one of those emails, it, like, it melts my heart. Like I feel so good about it. Right. I do, I would love to put out a, a voice, a full voice. As much as I tell myself I don't wanna do any oscillators, I don't know, I guess I would, I mean, there's actually some fairly famous people using my stuff. I don't know, I guess if I saw it on like the Oscars or something, it'd blow my mind. But I don't even actually care about that. So I, I don't know how to answer your question. This is a very good question though. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, I, is there, like, one of the things that I feel like is when I, when I go on your site, I see that you're almost as driven by teaching as you are by selling gear. Right? Definitely. I mean, is there, definitely, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2788.205" data-end_ts="2788.325" title="2788.205" id=c_"2788.205">__is__</span> there anything, is there anything like on those, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2791.345" data-end_ts="2791.565" title="2791.345" id=c_"2791.345">__gut__</span>, the teaching part of it that you wish you either, I mean, maybe it's even something that you don't feel like you have the skills to do, but you wish you could explain better? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>Oh, yeah. I mean, I wish, I wish I had the knowledge. And your listeners are saying, well, go take an electric courts idiot <laugh>. And like, I, I know I have a day job guys. Like, I can't do that <laugh>. Like, I can't just go to college right now. You know, I I definitely wish I had, more of the knowledge. A lot of, you know, a lot, a lot of times putting out a a module is a little frightening because, you know, I know it works and I know basically why it works. I might not be able to do the math on why it works. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2840.705" data-end_ts="2840.925" title="2840.705" id=c_"2840.705">__Mm__</span>. Right, right. But you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2842.365" data-end_ts="2842.485" title="2842.365" id=c_"2842.365">__I__</span>, I know essentially why it works, but I also know, you know, I was talking with another maker the other day, I can't remember his company. He's in, I think he's in Canada. And his documentation is amazing. It's like, it's, it's like an electro notes manual, you know, like you get his, his filter, you're getting like 10. It's like those M-M-O-T-M models used to get Right. Where there's like 10 pages of documentation that come with this thing. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Like a book. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>A book. Yeah. And it's like, you know, would I ever read it? Probably not. But, it's cool that it's there. I love that the thought and energy went behind that kind of documentation, and I can do a certain amount of documentation up to that point. But at some point in time it's gonna fall apart. I probably should just challenge myself too, because then I would actually learn the things. So there's a little post-it note for me to write <laugh>. But, I would love for the web design to be like, it's pretty good, especially for a DIY synthesizer site. But, you know, like having cool little overlays and stuff would be cool. I am trying to, like, if you go to the filter and you look at the build guide, it's different than the other ones because it, it's a checklist, which is actually the checklist I used, I use when I build a thing. So I'm trying to get that together. I wish there were a lot more guides. Like I've got a to-do list with 30 articles that I wanna write, and there's just not enough time. So I wanna write all those things. I want someone to be able to learn everything in the, in the world about DIY <span style="color:red" data-ts="2939.845" data-end_ts="2940.085" title="2939.845" id=c_"2939.845">__sent__</span> from my site that then I'll win. How about that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Nice. There you go. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>Unreachable goal. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I like that. Well, aim high. You might hit it right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>Who knows 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> well, I, I strongly hope that you at least make a good, take a good swing at that goal. I think it's great. I, I am inspired. I, I kinda walked away from DIY because of some kind of rough experiences myself. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I look at your site and I'm inspired by it. I mean, I'm inspired to like pull the soldering iron out of the garage and, and, and get to building because it, it's not only exciting to think of like getting new modules and stuff, but I do really understand sort of the, the joy that comes with getting something working and being part of, it's almost like you become part of a part of a group by doing that. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But, with that, I, we are going to, wrap this up. I'm gonna let you have the rest of your evening. Thank you so much for taking the time to have the chat. It was really great. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>Oh, it's my pleasure. Thank you so much for, for having me and, and letting me ramble on. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It was a lot of fun, man. I appreciate it. With that, we'll say goodbye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Abraham: </b>Bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Many thanks to Abraham for, having a chat. If you are not familiar with this stuff, you oughta be, it's a really great way to get into DIY and, there's just some really great modules. So check 'em out. If you have any questions, you can drop me a line ddg@cyclingseventyfour.com or ddg@twentyobjects.com or darwin.Gross@gmail.com. I answer to 'em all. So drop me a line. Thank you so much for listening. Make sure you share this with your friends. And do me a favor. If you get a chance, just drop me a line and tell me where you listen. I've actually gotten a lot of noise from people lately that are listening on Spotify. I'd like to have a sense of where the listenership is coming from. So if you could do me that favor, I'd really appreciate it. And with that, I'm gonna let you go. Have a blast. Bye.
