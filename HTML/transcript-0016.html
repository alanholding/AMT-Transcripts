      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Okay today, we are going to be interviewing one of my favorite people in the world. This Matthew Davidson it goes sometimes artistically by the name Stretta he is, fanatic for so many things that I can appreciate such as model
        homes, modular sense, big cat guy. I'm not sure that I'm into that as much. He is, just a tremendous person to be around and spend time with and, really excited to be able to do this interview. Hi, Matthew, how are you doing? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Matthew Davidson: </b>I <span style="color:red" data-ts="38.61" data-end_ts="39.08" title="38.61" id=c_"38.61">__Darwin__</span>, cats like me. I, I, you know, I see that I share my life space with them and we kind of like coexist. I it's
      it's you know, I guess I like being around cats, but they, they seem to really enjoy being around me.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Well, good for you. Cats, for some reason, I have such a weird interaction with animals. It's not even funny. Cats seem to think that I'm going to eat them in dogs. Dogs seem to think that I'm actually holding, really
        interesting food in my pants. So there you go. That's my interaction with animals in a nutshell. So, thanks a lot for being part of the, the interview. I really appreciate it. The podcast needs a guy like you, </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Matthew: </b>Thanks for giving me this opportunity.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Sure. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="92.32" data-end_ts="92.35" title="92.32" id=c_"92.32">__I__</span> also thought <span style="color:red" data-ts="92.87" data-end_ts="92.93" title="92.87" id=c_"92.87">__of__</span>
        podcasts. Why don't we start off by having you give us a little bit of background? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Matthew: </b>You know, where, where did you grow up? Darwin, Northern Wisconsin. Okay. So I grew up in Iowa and so I'm from the Midwest and, we both kind of share that. I wanted to ask you a question about when did you first become aware
      that you were really interested in synthesizers?
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>I don't know that I was always like really into sound. So my mom has stories about like me being in the grocery store, like trying out the sound of rotting, rubbing my fingernail against different kinds of paper plates,
        because they each had their own sound right. And stuff like that. And then, my uncle had, was really into the Hi-Fi things. So he had a real, real tape deck and stuff like that. And he got me into the recording thing. And so I just would
        record, you know, I had this setup in the basement bathroom. That was my recording studio, and I would just record ridiculous things and do the whole pause, edit thing on cassette decks. And he had, he had, 10 30, four 40 real, real deck. So
        I got a chance to do a little, overdubbing, which was really pretty awesome, but it was when I, when I first went to college, one of my best friends there, was a keyboard player and he kind of introduced me to synthesizers. So I was like,
        well, that's cool. I was a guitar player. And I was like, well, Hmm, I like this kind of stuff. And then when I went into composition, in college, I all of a sudden realized that synthesizer gave me the opportunity to try out my compositions
        without having to get a full band together. And so it was kind of like a twisty passage. I've always been into sound and synthesizers just happened to be a really cool way to work on <span style="color:red" data-ts="220.39"
          data-end_ts="220.69" title="220.39" id=c_"220.39">__sewn__</span>. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Matthew: </b>That, that sounds very familiar because I I'm feel the same way. I was always interested in sound. And, and I, and things that could generate new sounds from nothing and before, you know, synthesizes are really available. What
      that meant was I was really kind of very interested in home organs and I wanted to, I wanted a home Oregon so badly. I pestered my parents and I never got a home organ. <span style="color:red" data-ts="248.52" data-end_ts="248.55"
        title="248.52" id=c_"248.52">__I__</span> never, never got one. But I had spent a lot of time, you know, down at the mall where they would sell these things and be fascinated by all the buttons and the multiple manuals. And that was just
      really very fascinating to me. And I was really kind of fortunate because my, my dad was a successful entrepreneur. And so we apparently had some disposable income that he pursued. One of his interests that today we would be calling multimedia,
      or, or maybe a few years ago we'd be calling multimedia.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Matthew: </b>But what it involved in those days was, he was a photographer first and he almost always shot on slide film. And so he got to the point where he had like multiple projectors under computer control and computer in those days
      meant like a dedicated sequencer device about the size of the <span style="color:red" data-ts="304.2" data-end_ts="304.59" title="304.2" id=c_"304.2">__Roland__</span> MCH that would control the brightness of these, the sequencing of the
      projectors and, and do it to time code. So you could have <span style="color:red" data-ts="313.08" data-end_ts="313.23" title="313.08" id=c_"313.08">__a__</span>, you could have this real, real machine that was like spewing off the time code on
      one track, and then another track would have the music. And so, that's how I had a reel-to-reel in my house and I had a basement studio and a guitar, and I would be, you know, trying to synthesize all sorts of weird sounds with tape. And, and
      then also I was fortunate enough that he had a really, you know, early interest in computers.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Matthew: </b>And when I first started composing music because of the Macintosh and we had a 128 K Mac in 1984, and I used a, I used a program called music works, and, and this, this program changed, you know, my life essentially because,
      what it allowed me to do was, it had a staff and you had like a pallet of notes and you could drag a note from the staff or from the pallet and place it on the staff. And you had four voices. Now we had Apple two computers before that, but
      unless you had like extra hardware, like a Mockingbird or whatever, you can only get one voice out of, it was not very interesting. The original one 28 K Mac had a four voice synthesizer, and you can get like kind of different tones out of it
      without any additional hardware. And music works allowed me to, you know, compose little motifs and, you know, dragging, notes since this stuff gets kind of tedious after a while.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Matthew: </b>So then you quickly learn, you know, I want to copy these two measures and paste it somewhere else in copying pasting, and then you could like transpose stuff, and then you could write, you know, some counterpoint to that. And,
      and so it was the computer that, that taught me how to compose. And that was really wonderful because it was not judgemental at all. Like I could, I could do, I could explore whatever I wanted and the computer wouldn't be like, well, that's
      crap. It would just play back, whatever it was that I, that I put on there. And then only shortly thereafter was able to, then upgrade to a <span style="color:red" data-ts="433.94" data-end_ts="434.21" title="433.94"
        id=c_"433.94">__Mitty__</span> interface, but that also involves, you know, having some type of synthesizer that also supported <span style="color:red" data-ts="440.12" data-end_ts="440.45" title="440.12" id=c_"440.12">__Mitty__</span> input
      and output. And, my, I had like in lieu of having like a home Oregon, you know, what I, what I did have was a Casio keyboard, which is almost as good.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Matthew: </b>I mean, you had to do all sorts of, there's all sorts of little hacks that you could do to make it sound kind of different than what they had intended. And then I, but that didn't have middy. And so my first real <span
        style="color:red" data-ts="467.72" data-end_ts="468.44" title="467.72" id=c_"467.72">__mini__</span> synthesizer that allowed me to connect to the computer was a Casio CZ one Oh one. And I had the code editor. I had, you know, you were all
      in. Yeah. Yeah. And that was, that was like 85 if I remember correctly. And by that time, I had, upgraded my Mac to a five 12, in a really, you know, brutal hard way by soldering the Ram onto the motherboard. Yeah. And upgrade you upgraded the
      ROMs to Mac plus <span style="color:red" data-ts="498.65" data-end_ts="499.13" title="498.65" id=c_"498.65">__runs__</span> anyway. So I had <span style="color:red" data-ts="499.91" data-end_ts="499.97" title="499.91"
        id=c_"499.91">__a__</span>, I had a five, 12 K Mac, and I had this other device that was, a, analog to digital converter that you could plug into your serial port.
    </p>

    -----

    <p>
      <b>Matthew: </b>It was an eight bit digital analog converter analog to digital converter. And it had like four different things you could do, you could sample with it, which was, you know, doing sampled stuff without a Mirage, which was
      available at that time was, it was kind of a big deal and be able to do that, but even more interestingly well, or, or at least on the equal footing was the ability to use all the Ram inside my Mac as a delay pedal and do, and do sound on sound
      recording. And I did this ridiculous stuff with my guitar, plugged into my computer, doing these really long delay lines. And I had so much fun with that. It was just such a great, great experience. And so <span style="color:red"
        data-ts="548.34" data-end_ts="548.52" title="548.34" id=c_"548.34">__the__</span>, that period of time between like 1985 and 1988, when I was just, you know, working with this computer and then acquiring either through borrowing or buying,
      other things and kind of augmenting that kind of putting together a little bit more substantial studio before I headed out to college. That's that kind of sums up my original background in musical theater.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Sure. Well, it's really interesting that you talk about sort of the nonjudgmental nature of working on these things. I think that that's incredibly important. I, I got an Intuit, roughly simultaneous with going to music
        composition school and I found, so I was, I went to North Texas. I was a guitar performance major. And, the brutality of the process was just not, I was not wired up for that and Oh yeah. Well, and then, so I switched over to the new music,
        composition thing, and I mean, it was fun. We did ridiculous things, you know, like writing, writing a piece for 27 marimbas and a guitar synth. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>But the problem was, I mean, it was twofold. One was that you had to like find 27 Roomba players, you know, first of all. And then secondly, was that, the second that you put that number, that amount of resources behind
        something, it, it right away went into the sort of like spanking machine where it was judged for validity. It's like, Oh, you didn't, you know, you would have done so much better if you would've had this passing line here or whatever. And it
        was really kind of, again, I wasn't really wired for that kind of, that kind of judgmental behavior. And it really put a bollix on me. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Matthew: </b>I think there's like two stages you have to go through when learning any sort of new technology. And the first stage is the exploration of the process and you, and you do this because you just love doing it. You're, you're
      intrinsically motivated to explore. You're not necessarily looking for an outcome. Like this is going to be a compositional statement that I want everyone to hear, but you have to get through, like, you have to love the, the, the mechanical or
      technological process behind it and just do it over and over and over again, without someone telling you that's bad, you know, you shouldn't do that. You should just, it should be aimless exploration for the love of doing it. The second stage
      is putting the technique that you've learned in the service of an idea and the it's and some people, they want to go right to stage two, but they don't have the technical or mechanical background in order to execute their ideas. And they get
      frustrated and quit. There's people that get so wrapped up in stage one and never leave. And so, right. And so what they do is just like aimless exploration all their time, all the time. And they never actually develop a compositional sense.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Yeah. Which I think for people who are looking for sort of a diversion from the real world, I think that's, that's awesome to, to be able to embrace that stage one behavior. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Matthew: </b>Well, you need to be clear what your goals are. If your goals are to have fun, then stage one, never leaving stage one is perfectly fine. It's awesome. Yeah. Yeah.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>So, one of the things that I think people will find interesting is that you have a background not only with keyboards, but you would rake on a guitar occasionally. And I see it's interesting because really, for me, at least I
        always think of the guitar as having been my prodo controller. Right. It was before someone had invented controllers, I had this thing that I could, I could do stuff on and it would generate sound that I could further manipulate. I would say
        that an awful lot of people, you came on a lot of people's radar initially, with your work, with the model, your development programs there, your interaction with the community cuss a little bit about why you got into the model home and what
        it is that was special about the model home that, that spoke to you. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Matthew: </b>You know, I don't want this, this conversation is going to involve a lot of Macs and it's necessary to talk about the <span style="color:red" data-ts="835.02" data-end_ts="835.47" title="835.02" id=c_"835.02">__monomer__</span>,
      especially with the way that I, I look at it. And so unfortunately, when you were going to have to invoke max here,
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>But I love me some max, </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Matthew: </b>It's, I I'd like to point out that it's 2014 and the Monome came out in 2006. So we're almost looking at a decade already, of, of the <span style="color:red" data-ts="856.23" data-end_ts="856.61" title="856.23"
        id=c_"856.23">__monomer__</span> and its cultural impact on the musical landscape. You know, it's almost time where we can kind of reflect back, you know, where we were at that time. So in hindsight, the Monome seems really obvious doesn't
      it. But, when I first saw the Monome, I immediately saw it as the physical expression of a max patch because I spent, you know, at, at 2006, I spent how many years using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_(software)">Max/MSP</a> and
      trying to draft like mini controllers into the service of being a max interface. And if you use like a PC 1600 or a mini keyboard, and you're trying to map your max idea to these two, these controllers, you're blind, the controllers don't give
      you any sort of feedback at all.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Matthew: </b>And so I've been frustrated for, with physical controllers, and it actually, the lack of physical controllers eventually kind of turned me off of max for a little bit. I just, and then I kind of went back to Dawes and, and
      focused on that for a long time. Moms were the things that actually brought me back to max. And so it's this idea of intelligent feedback. That is the not so obvious idea, with madams and grid controllers, see if, if mom had come from a
      corporation, there would have been some default led behavior that you would have to, or override in order to get to a permanently decoupled operation. Right. You know, if, if it was designed by a Kai or Roland or whatever, it would do something
      out of the box and, and that, and madams didn't, they didn't do anything. And, but the beauty of that is you don't have any LCD menus or like <span style="color:red" data-ts="966.65" data-end_ts="967.07" title="966.65"
        id=c_"966.65">__start-up__</span> sequences in order to get it into that state, which is its native state that it was actually designed for. So the, the not so obvious thing about the <span style="color:red" data-ts="976.43"
        data-end_ts="976.73" title="976.43" id=c_"976.43">__Monome__</span> isn't the, the grid or the LEDs, it's the fact that the LEDs are permanently decoupled from the LEDs. And that was, that was the revolutionary idea. Yeah.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>I have to tell you that I met Brian Crabtree, somewhat before he kicked off the model. He was working in LA with someone and I was asked to help out. And so I met him and we kind of got along pretty well right off the bat. And
        one day he comes, comes in and he's like, Darren, when I have to show you what I'm really working on, and this is my passionate thing, and he shows me this little block of like four buttons and I'm like, cool, <span style="color:red"
          data-ts="1020.97" data-end_ts="1021.18" title="1020.97" id=c_"1020.97">__you__</span> in <span style="color:red" data-ts="1021.42" data-end_ts="1021.51" title="1021.42" id=c_"1021.42">__your__</span> you're inventing buttons. He's like, you
        know, it's got these particular fields and stuff, but the main thing is, is the light underneath the button is decoupled from the button. And I was like, yeah, that's that sounds unfortunate. Little did I realize how important that was to
        the, to the, functionality of what became the model? And also, I think it really does point out something that you just mentioned, which is this idea that not having default <span style="color:red" data-ts="1056.37" data-end_ts="1056.88"
          title="1056.37" id=c_"1056.37">__behavior__</span> is actually a really freeing option when you're going to develop something that interacts with that device. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Matthew: </b>The decoupling made it more simple because, because you didn't have to accommodate any other default behavior. Now regarding Brian, I didn't know him before <span style="color:red" data-ts="1076.37" data-end_ts="1076.91"
        title="1076.37" id=c_"1076.37">__Monome__</span>, but you know, after I met him, I would have to say, it's hard not to like this guy. My, my theory about personal relationships, and people like Brian is you're fortunate to be able to meet
      someone like Brian, like every 10 years of your life. And, and the by definition, I'd say, if you meet someone who can change the way you think, or, or challenge some of the things that you, that you thought were true, that's, that's the kind
      of person that Brian is. And so every, every, every 10 years you might be fortunate to income to encounter someone like that. So, yeah. He's, he's a pretty exceptional guy.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>He's a special guy. Yeah. So, you actually developed several applications that, became pretty widely used in the Monome community. I'm thinking particularly poly go, man, that's how you see it. Right. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Matthew: </b>Probably gummy came from this, this larger application I made for the two 56 called Gulmay and it was, it was a monophonic thing and it was kind of, I don't know why, why they call it Gamay and why it was like, kind of weird
      like that. And gummy never actually saw the light of day. It was just kind of, and, and not very easy to use or understands. And I simplified it in one way and then made it polyphonic and that's, that was probably gummy. That's the way you say
      it. And, and I'm sorry, or I apologize for, bringing to the world another like weird word words that nobody knows how to pronounce. They're like afraid to mention in conversation like myself, like no one knew how to pronounce <span
        style="color:red" data-ts="1185.68" data-end_ts="1186.04" title="1185.68" id=c_"1185.68">__Monome__</span>. Right. So yeah, it's a weird name.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Matthew: </b>I'm sorry. But you know, the, the face of Monome and the, the, the killer application for it was MLR, and that was the, that was the sample cutting application that, that Brian made. And I think was really the, the drove a lot
      of the design ideas for, for <span style="color:red" data-ts="1206.63" data-end_ts="1207.07" title="1206.63" id=c_"1206.63">__Mon__</span>. And that's the one that everyone really knows. I think the, a distant second, maybe poly gummy, just,
      and the reason it was popular is because someone could get among them and play with MLR, but they wanted the idea that there was other applications there, other things that you could do with it, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1224.2"
        data-end_ts="1224.5" title="1224.2" id=c_"1224.2">__Polly__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1224.5" data-end_ts="1224.86" title="1224.5" id=c_"1224.5">__gummy__</span> had this. And when I first made it polyphonic and started playing
      with it, I knew immediately it was one of those fun things that people would enjoy playing. And I think that's why it became really popular. They could, they could show their friends like, Oh, here's MLR. And then here's this other application
      polygamy, and you could shove it into somebody's hands and they could start mashing buttons on it and get some really kind of pleasant. Yeah,
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>It's interesting you say it that way, because that was, that's been my experience. I, so I teach a little visual programming class at a local university and inevitably about once every quarter, some kid will come in and be
        like, Hey, have you ever seen this thing? And what they'll do is they'll show me a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1272.43" data-end_ts="1273" title="1272.43" id=c_"1272.43">__monogram__</span> or one of the <span style="color:red"

        you need anything else? You clean? Anything else it's, it's everything you could want, you know, and </i>

    <p>
      <b>Matthew: </b>There's two things you've established that it does more than one thing. Right,
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Right. Which is, which is kind of a big deal, right? Yeah. That's a big deal. You're good point. Now, to what extent do you continue to use, well, first of all, to what extent did the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1321.98"

    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Matthew: </b>I, I see max patches, and again, I'm gonna return to max again, as an expression of like a musical idea, it's like, you can ex you can express kind of a, an interactive or a, generative music idea in, in visually in code in max.
      And that's really powerful to me. If you then couple a physical interface to it, like, like a Monome you have this interactive system, I using these tools, a lot of the things that I made for the Monome they're good for, like, you can make an,
      a section of a composition, but transitioning from like an, a section to a B section, or like trying to really sculpt a compositional statement, that can sustain people's interests, would require editing or like something more involves, when I
      do something in max that is a musical idea that's expressed in a code.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Matthew: </b>Once it's done, I tend to forget about it. It's like, okay, that's, it's a finished musical statement and instruments like polygamy. And I think you could want then, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1409.43"
        data-end_ts="1410.21" title="1409.43" id=c_"1409.43">__***<inaudible>***__</span> in the same, in the same area, it's like, it's, those things are somewhat a large part is the expression of the person who designed that software. And then it's
      kind of being manipulated in real time by the person using it. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="1425.2" data-end_ts="1425.74" title="1425.2" id=c_"1425.2">__polygamy__</span> suffers from the same issues as I think that it's an Orien does
      that, to a certain extent, if you put it in different people's hands, it kind of masks the, the, the musical intention of the artist. So you're hearing more polygamy, or you're hearing more to Norian than you are hearing the person that's
      making the aesthetic decisions, pressing the interface. And, this isn't, this doesn't, isn't limited exclusively to like things that I make for the Monome. But it's like, I have this idea I want to, I want to express it and I express it in max.
      And then once it's done, I'm ready to move on to the next thing, because there are so many ideas that I want to get to and work on that I just don't have time to like, go back and, and think more about it.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>So, one of the things you just said in that last statement is that these kinds of devices and programs suffer from, the sort of like injection of the developer into the, into the music, but to a certain extent, isn't that what
        all instruments do in one way or another. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Matthew: </b>Yes. It's just exacerbated by the, by the fact that you're using software. And I want to, I want to say that it's not the device, it's not anything to do with the modem. It's, it's the software that's running behind it. And so I
      think there's a spectrum of like, where things fall and more like you're expressing the person who did the software and making your own expression. There's a spectrum where you could fall between, what any particular piece of software does.
      The, the main issue for me is you can take a guitar and you can put it in the hands of several different people. And when, if you can tell the difference between who's playing it, that's, that makes it more of a musical instrument. If you can't
      tell who's pressing the buttons, if you close your eyes and you can't tell who's making <span style="color:red" data-ts="1541.83" data-end_ts="1541.89" title="1541.83" id=c_"1541.83">__the__</span> music, then that's, that's the real difference
      for me. I, I like, I like what you're saying. I, you know, all musical instruments are an expression of technology. I totally agree with that. This is just like, my way of, of like drawing this particular line. If you, if you can't tell who's
      playing it, then what's the point.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Yeah. Now, to what extent do you think that that's just the, that there's an element of time involved there too? You know, so for example, I would say that during the early days of electric guitar, everybody sounded like
        Charlie Christian or Les Paul, and then eventually as people spent time and in and built facility on a thing that it took on more individualistic characteristics, software tends to be something that we roll pretty quickly. We get into
        software and then a month and a half later, we're like, Oh, there's a better thing out there. I'm sure. And we download something new and there you go. You're off to the races with a completely different instrument, even if it has the theme,
        same physical expression through a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1622.4" data-end_ts="1622.85" title="1622.4" id=c_"1622.4">__monomer__</span> or whatever the change out of the software sort of limits the, I mean, I hate to say it because
        this is getting to be a common theme in my podcasts, but I'm always interested in exploring with people what they think about sort of the rapid turnover, nature of technology and especially software. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Matthew: </b>I, in general, I think software when applied to music is a type of expression multiplier. And I like to divide that into two different, two different categories. There's, expression multiplier. If you're expressing something in
      real time, there's things that you can do with software by yourself, that would require multiple people, to do in real time. And that's, that's really powerful and not real time. In other words, like a recording environment, software is, is a
      different kind of expression multiplier. And I don't, I don't think it, and again, I treat software as, as a tool and I treat a musical instrument as a tool, but I think we also need to acknowledge that, automation and software automation are
      things that, are kind of fundamentally different than just saying, Oh, guitar's a piece of technology. And it, since we are, since electronic music and software assisted electronic music are still in their infancy, we really don't have any, we
      can't really make any sort of projections about where this is all heading and you, and you did key on something that I, that I totally agree with.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Matthew: </b>And that is the speed at which, things are turning over is accelerating, but that's true for, you know, any facet of technology.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>That's true for everything. You're right. Very interesting. Now <span style="color:red" data-ts="1730.15" data-end_ts="1730.48" title="1730.15" id=c_"1730.15">__what__</span>, what, as we talk about the <span style="color:red"

        music making world. And that is sort of the exact opposite, which is your interaction with modular synthesizers, which if anything, exchanges the flexibility and speed of software with the obsessive compulsive driven world of lots of little
        modules and lots of little patch cards. And, I mean, there are obviously similarities, particularly with your use of max and then your ability to use a modular synthesizer, but how do those two things, how do those two worlds match up for
        you, </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Matthew: </b>The Monome world and the modular world?
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>How did this match up at all? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Matthew: </b>Well, I mean, I spent a lot of time, you know, combining the two modular and, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1799.1" data-end_ts="1799.46" title="1799.1" id=c_"1799.1">__motto__</span>. So, I guess maybe we should kind of
      regroup and say, why modular, you know, why, what is the, what is the appeal of modular modular? So I asked you when you first started getting interested in synthesizers, let me, let me also ask this question when, what was your appeal for
      getting into modulars and when did you, when did you first have your own con what I would say complete modular system that, that you had, you know, available all to your own once himself?
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Well, that's kind of a complex question because, my, I mean, one of the things I didn't talk about with my early days of synthesizes was when I was going to school at North Texas, having an opportunity to work in a little,
        like, it was a time when the school was really excited about disklaviers or yeah, yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1861.8" data-end_ts="1862.01" title="1861.8" id=c_"1861.8">__It's__</span>, Claviers not Disklavier <span

        equivalent. So one of the things they did was they had a little room and they put a 2,600 in it and a 30, a 33 40 and, model three, a mixing desk from Tascam. And it was sort of like, okay, you undergrads, you have to use this <span
          style="color:red" data-ts="1890.93" data-end_ts="1891.32" title="1890.93" id=c_"1890.93">__scudi__</span> system and the broom closet and all of us really smart people, aren't going to use the same collaborators. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Well, it was great because for me, I could go in there and that was where I was like, Oh, okay, this is what, you know, this is what filtering does. This is what FM between two oscillators does. This is what an envelope does.
        This is what our envelope does when I'm F I mean, this is what these different kind of control stages do. And that was really, really important. So the 2,600 was sort of like laid out there as, as kind of the way that I learned synthesis,
        which is a pretty awesome way to learn synthesis. But, so after I washed out of North Texas, and I just like wandered the wilderness for a decade, I, the internet comes along and I stumble across this news, this mail list called analog
        heaven. And I start reading it and people start talking about all this stuff that I loved. I was like, Ooh, ah, so I started, I would just, I was traveling a lot of time. And so I would just like, say, </i>

    <p>
      <b>Matthew: </b>What year was that when you were on?
    </p>

    -----

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>I think I started in maybe 94 ish. Do you remember me at all from there? Not really. The main thing was that what I would do first of all, I mean, I remember getting on it through like pan and stuff, right? The, these old
        network interfaces, it was kind of ridiculous. But, one of the things that, that I would do is I would just be like, okay, I'm flying to Atlanta for work. I'm just going to find out someone on analog heaven that lives in Atlanta and drop in
        on them, or I'm going to San Francisco, or I'm going to wherever. And so I would just show up at these people houses and they'd be like, Oh, Hey, how are you doing? Let me show you my gear. Cause that's what we did. Right. And that was when I
        got kind of introduced to the, to the real modular systems, because a lot of these people had some form of modular system. It really blew open when I met grant Richter in Milwaukee, which is where I lived. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Matthew: </b>Now, at that time, all modulars were all vintage. There wasn't a new one.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>I mean, well, you could, you could still buy, you could still have Rex probe make a certain system. And that's how I got back into it was a combination of ha getting <span style="color:red" data-ts="2054.35"
          data-end_ts="2054.83" title="2054.35" id=c_"2054.35">__Serge__</span> equipment. And then, I ran across, the ability to purchase a bunch of old Aries modules. So I had, I had an <span style="color:red" data-ts="2063.5" data-end_ts="2064.01"
          title="2063.5" id=c_"2063.5">__Aries__</span> system and quite an extensive, like an 11 panel search system. It was awesome. But at the same time, much of it was, it was not only vintage. I mean, some of this stuff was the old paper sheet,
        front panels. And so getting the work generally involves a lot of shaking of the cabinet and stuff. It was pretty awesome, but I mean, I was just drawn to it because there was this sense that there was, there was always an unexplored world of
        I never plugged this thing into that thing. I wonder what happens, you know, there was that, and there was also this thing where you would plug something in, you turn it off when you turn it on the next day, a completely different thing with
        sound would come squirting out of it. I just sorta like the animalistic behavior of that, you know, </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Matthew: </b>I had, I had a good 10 years of music making with middy, from, from like 90, from the 85 to 95, it was all about, you know, Multiport media interfaces and buying lots of, you know, having one controller and buying a whole bunch
      of modules, you know, and you'd have a different synthesizer module, which would have a different of sound. And then if you wanted to edit anything, I, I tried, you know, various, you know, editor librarians, but I mean really when it comes
      down to, it involves knowing kind of like a different operating system in different, you know, LCD menu and how to get into each of these things. And then I remember reading in the mid nineties and, and a lot of my heroes at the time were
      making music the same way I was, you know, and I remember reading that Vince Clark was abandoning MITIE because the timing was awful.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Matthew: </b>And I, I thought that guy's nuts. You know, it, it seemed like it was such a huge step backward technologically. And, but that was the moment where I actually, that was the moment where I started thinking about analog and I was
      gone on analog heaven. And, you know, I've, I've been online since, since 84. And I had my first Unix shell account at, in like 89. And so I was, you know, accessing Usenet and, and all that back, back then, that's how I got in touch with the
      analog Kevin. And so the people there, there was no, it was all vintage everything. So it was like tracking down mano since, and, and, and having like a collection of monocytes or like a, you know, a really nice analog polysynth was like the
      ideal, like that was what everyone kind of like strove for and people were weren't really, it wasn't about the sound, although there's aspects about the sound that were, that was really compelling.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Matthew: </b>It was about interface, nobody in the mid nineties, in before with very few exceptions, it was all, you know, menu driven stuff and people, you were kind of getting the sense that people we're tired of it at the same time. You
      know, we're read if you're chasing these monocytes and they were <span style="color:red" data-ts="2248.07" data-end_ts="2248.43" title="2248.07" id=c_"2248.07">__gradually__</span>, you know, eBay came about and they started like rising in
      value pretty, pretty rapidly. Then it kind of shifted from like analog vintage stuff to trying to get your hands on modular and modular was re you know, your choice was vintage. And so it was impossible. And then doc first started, you know,
      making some modules. And I remember I was, I was at the point where I don't know what year this was, but I had a choice between I'm maybe building some models via a mot M or, or like trying to find something via, trying to find a system that I
      didn't have to build, but it was also pretty cheap.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Matthew: </b>And I, so my first modulator was, I spent a thousand dollars and I got it, from eBay in Germany. And I, I conducted the transaction through <span style="color:red" data-ts="2303.96" data-end_ts="2304.29" title="2303.96"
        id=c_"2303.96">__Babel__</span> fish. Right. And, so I got a six U you know, Duffer, basic system from, from Germany, for, you know, it was a nice little starter. And that was, that was the beginning of the, of the modular thing. And, so then
      I have to kind of ask myself, well, why modular, which is what, how we started this conversation. And I wanted to provide some background about where we were coming from, because I never had the first wave of analog. And I don't, it doesn't
      sound like you did either. So I came of age using, you know, mini and modules and, and I was tired of Ellie. I was tired of LCD menus and increment buttons and like page pages of parameters, it just got in the way of, of making, you know, under
      it got in the way of the process of making music that felt really natural to me.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Matthew: </b>And, and so I, I really began to appreciate one function per interface elements, as, as you would find on a, on an analog synthesizer. They, in other words, if you have a data entry knob, it's always going to be data entry. It's
      not going to be modal or context specific or changing its function underneath you via software products that do that drive me nuts. And there's, there's, you know, for space reasons or economy reasons there's still happens. But when I encounter
      a product that does it, it just drives me bonkers. So that was the, that was one thing why I really liked modular. The other thing that I really liked modular was the beauty of one volt proactive. And this has the kind of simplistic beauty that
      I see also in what I was referring to like Brian's, beauty when he designed something minimalistic, if your max is really awesome, if you were, if you were coming from, eighties or early nineties synthesizers, they displayed values and like
      arbitrary units, zero to one 27 octal displays, right?
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Matthew: </b>Octal display Mirage is a great, is a great example. And so when you got to max and then <span style="color:red" data-ts="2427.89" data-end_ts="2428.03" title="2427.89" id=c_"2427.89">__you__</span>, you got ways to express data
      in real-world units, which was, which is great. So now you can specify things in terms of frequency and, and, and Mitty notes. And that was really wonderful. But then you, you would create something in max and want to be able to use it with
      something else. And if you, when you start trying to create a reusable code, part of the reusability is the ability to hook one thing to another thing. And when you start doing this, you have like parameter mismatches, like, what is this
      message? Even though it's a rich, real real-world message, you're going to have to translate it or scale it to this other thing, the beauty of one volt proactive is that you can specify any parameter that you want, in mute from musical
      expression, you how loud something is the, the shape, the shape of the modulation, how the Tambor is changing. The note, everything can be expressed with the same one volt practice signal, and this is exceptionally powerful because it's so
      simple. And that was the thing that I really, those two things were the things that really, got me to enjoy using a modular. It wasn't about analog versus digital. It was about interface using your hands and an, and you, weren't worried about
      if, you know, I plugged this cable <span style="color:red" data-ts="2506.61" data-end_ts="2506.76" title="2506.61" id=c_"2506.61">__under__</span> this one, is it going to do the right thing? Or is it not going to understand the message?
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Yeah, I think that, you really laid it out. Well, I know that there are a lot of people that really have a strong reaction to the quality of the sound, since I've always been fascinated by sound, no matter where it's come
        from. Digital and analog sound are just gradations of the great world of sound, but that user interface, the end, I guess, had never really thought of one volt per octave has as having some sort of intrinsic and minimalist beauty. But, you
        know, maybe that's, for me, that's, that's a better expression of my love of being able to plug anything in anything and see what happens. I mean, there's, yeah. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Matthew: </b>Compare it to, OSC where you have a zero to one floating point range. Right, right. And it doesn't really compare one volt practice where if you add a, add a volt, you get an octave to kind of like cramming everything into this
      zero to one arbitrary, you know, you know what I mean? Right. And so it's actually more beautiful than I think, OSC in some, in, in that.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Yeah. In some ways. Sure. Well, now one of the things that I would say is maybe I shouldn't frame it as a problem, although it's expressed to me as a problem a lot of times, because I'm sort of out there as modular guy. Right.
        And I'll go, I'll do performances or I'll go to meetups or whatever. And people are like, Oh, you're the guy with the modular, you know, sort of like, Oh, you're the guy who lives in a van down by the river. But a lot of times they'll say
        something like, it seems really interesting. A great sounds come out of it, but I can't do it because I want to keep on doing music. I don't want to get like fall into obsessive compulsive world. And I think that there is a lot of precedent
        for people becoming so entranced with patch cables, and finding exactly the right filter and comparing exponential curves of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2636.98" data-end_ts="2637.18" title="2636.98" id=c_"2636.98">__on__</span>
        envelopes and stuff like that, then that there's never an opportunity to get around to actually making music in the end. How, how do you face that scenario? How do you find a way to engage with the modular and still be making music? I mean,
        the music you make to me is some of the most beautiful electronic music I've heard. And I'm just wondering how you sort of like bridge the gap of enjoying the modular as a play thing, into making it be a real musical instrument. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Matthew: </b>There's absolutely nothing wrong with enjoying the modular and having fun. And that's it, as long as <span style="color:red" data-ts="2682.56" data-end_ts="2682.76" title="2682.56" id=c_"2682.56">__you__</span>, and I said this
      before, as long as you're clear about your goals, and it really the interface and, and when you're presented with it, it encourages that type of that type of behavior. And, if you, if you don't have a clear goal set up ahead of time, that act
      of using the modular, is probably in the end a lot more interesting to the person using the modular then to someone who would be listening to it. Right. And when I'm trying to, with my goal is to create a finished piece of music for the
      modular. Then I spend a lot of time composing first before I, before I get to, expressing it on the modular.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i><span style="color:red" data-ts="2729.57" data-end_ts="2729.66" title="2729.57" id=c_"2729.57">__Oh__</span>, that makes sense. But at some point then you have to use the modules. Do you, how do you interact between the
        modular and, and your DAW or whatever you use for your composition and recording tool? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Matthew: </b>Well, if you came the background of being able to use a media arrangement is that you can work compositionally and here your orchestration, as it's, as it's going, and then you can go back and change bits of your orchestration
      that aren't working. And that's, that's the main thing that's different when you're using a modular. You have to be able to imagine the rest of your orchestration, and how it's going to fit together, because you need to commit your work to the
      record button on, on that, on that path. And so, to somewhat mitigate that, often what I do is the line that I'm currently focusing on. I will record a lot of different variations of, and I'll do all sorts of different passes because, you know,
      recording is cheap, it doesn't cost, it doesn't cost anything to store these different takes. And so if I'm recording a composition that I'm working on, there's a process that emerges where it's kind of conducive to doing things like laundry.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Matthew: </b>Especially if it's a really long, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2816.45" data-end_ts="2816.69" title="2816.45" id=c_"2816.45">__con__</span> you know, I might do a take that's that's five minutes long, you know, and
      all the, all the modulation is automated and, within with, with the software. And a lot of people don't work this way a lot, but this is the way that I, that I work and I will, set up the take, you know, listen, listen, to make sure that it's
      doing the thing that I expected to do. And I specifically do not listen to the tape as it's recording, because I don't want to, get, I don't want to hear it when I'm sleeping the next day. If you hear the same thing, 20 times over and over. And
      the other that allows me to do is, I'll just go ahead and double it because I'll, I'll record a take that is that particular tambour, and then I'll record another take. And, and because all the modulations are still, you know, specific to that
      point in time, unless I'm doing some type of free running, running modulation, they, I have another exact copy, but it's not exact exactly. Yeah. That can make a stereo patch out of it's actually just two takes left and right.

      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Well, I just, I, I guess I have to admit that I've never really thought about doing, using that as an option because, you know, again, I too did so many years worth of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2889.54"
          data-end_ts="2889.9" title="2889.54" id=c_"2889.54">__middy__</span> oriented stuff. And so what you tend to do is because you wanted to have the flexibility of changing everything after the fact you'd never committed anything to the record
        button, unless you absolutely absolutely had to. And then if you did, you would like, obsess over getting the ultimate take, because then that was gone. Now I've never really thought of the idea of with the modular system, do five takes, do
        little tweaks in each one of them, and later, if you need flexibility, there's the flexibility of multiple takes. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Matthew: </b>Sometimes I will, I will do a performance take, you know, we're where I'm manipulating the modular. I mean, most people do that, but for me, it's more kind of like, here's a special take that isn't going to matter. Right. You
      know, and, but mostly compositionally I'm going for something very, very specific. And if I'm doing a performance take it's to create a particular effect that is either difficult to automate, or I'm trying to leverage, you know, serendipity in
      some way, but that's, you know, it's less common than I do that.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>It's really interesting. And it sounds like a really cool approach, that sort of like plays with both the ability to do real time, the ability to have a very thoughtful, compositional and, and tambour creation process. That's
        pretty neat. So, </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Matthew: </b>Well, you couldn't, you couldn't do something like this before having computer control and monitor. Yeah.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>That's absolutely true. That's, that's really true. Good point. So at this point, where, where are you at with your creative output? Are you, are we going to see another release from you anytime soon? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Matthew: </b>And you're familiar with the phrase you're only as good as your last hit for, for, for pop stars. And so what that meant was like, you know, your last album or your last single, if you, if you bombed them, people didn't really
      pay attention to you to, a lot of things have changed in the recording industry in the last 20 years. Things have changed a lot, but one of the things recently that has changed for people like myself is the stream, things like Facebook and
      Tumblr best exemplified by, by Twitter. And what you see there is like, what have you done for me in the last five minutes? And, and so, and, and the stream something you worked on for 30 minutes has the same value as something that you've
      worked on for a year. Right. And it's kind of disheartening. And in this video collection of, Miquel Gondry videos that I have, he, he comes up and he says, I don't know if he's serious or not easily. I wanted to choose between it and choosing
      between quality and quantity. I chose quantity because quality fades and quantity stays.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Matthew: </b>So, what this obviously does is it increases the amount of crap out in the, in the world. If you, if you are in this trap of, you know, constantly feeding your audience stuff, that you just did, you know, kind of like few
      minutes of nonsense and Hey, maybe it's great, but, it really didn't take much effort.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Well, I'm going to assume that you're not talking about my podcasts when you're talking. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Matthew: </b>No, I'm talking about musical. I'm talking about someone who's getting <span style="color:red" data-ts="3092.92" data-end_ts="3093.01" title="3092.92" id=c_"3092.92">__an__</span>, a musical expression. Yeah. And for me, this
      gets back to like, who is, who is your master? And part of the reason I make music is because I want to make the kind of music I want to hear. It's the music that I want to create. And I don't want to cater to, I don't want the audience to be
      dictating what it is that I, that I'm doing, because I don't think that's fair to the audience. it's like you end up, optimizing for the maximum audience and that's not at all why I wanted to monitor to make music. And I don't want to make
      something that's, I, I value, I value your time. I don't want to put something out there that doesn't mean anything, or it's just going to be a waste of your time.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Yeah, that makes sense. I always, I'm always surprised by people who say that they want their audience to drive the direction of the music when I consider that the audience showed up originally because of the original content
        of this person's vision. Right. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Matthew: </b>It's fine. It's fine to do it. It's just not what I want to do.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Okay. All right. That's good. You want to embrace everyone and Sean Nolan, I get that. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Matthew: </b>No, no, I don't. I don't want to embrace anyone other physical desire to express this thing that's inside my head.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>So are, are you just sort of like taking a break or are you just doing, doing things for yourself at the moment, or are you focused on other projects? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Matthew: </b>Well, th there is the other projects thing. And, the main thing that I've, I've been kind of focused on the last last year, that's, that's significant is, the, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="3200.95" data-end_ts="3201.19"
        title="3200.95" id=c_"3200.95">__beat__</span> modular project that kind of consumed most of my, you know, available free time when that was being developed. As far as my music is concerned, due to, what I'm doing professionally, both, two
      aspects of my life, one was cycling and one with, teaching, that sort of blew up, any sort of available musical time that I have in the short term. I'm not, I'm not constantly, I'm not trying to work on an album right now. But I do see that
      changing. And, and, but at the same time, I can't not work on music. It's just that nothing is, I have, so I have lots of things that I haven't, I haven't released.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Matthew: </b>But at the same time, I'm kind of enjoying making things that make music, and kind of a more, algorithmic way. I would like to be able to make things that continue to make music when I'm not working on it. There's, I have some
      ideas for, for some, kind of longer term, music <span style="color:red" data-ts="3267.73" data-end_ts="3267.97" title="3267.73" id=c_"3267.73">__re__</span> releasing projects that one I told you about earlier, which is like the, the recording
      robot, where I was like a, a client of a max patch. Do you want me to describe that process? Okay. So, if you're not familiar with mechanical Turk, it's a way of kind of like, outsourcing a job to a lot of different people. And I wanted to, I
      want to create a max patch. That is, that is a mechanical Turk. And I am, I happen to be the thing that it hires.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Matthew: </b>And so the max patch will, via some inputs, will create a new piece of music. And then it will hire me to, render that piece of music. And I will render it in short little phrases, like one bar or two bars, either by singing,
      mostly by singing, but, via other instruments. And I will never hear the completed composition. It knows, it knows the structure of the toll, composition, but I never get to hear it. I'm just there recording the parts that it tells me to
      record, and then it assembles it and then uploads it to a SoundCloud account or a tumbler or something. And so it would have, it would do like a new composition, like on a regular basis. I haven't decided what that, what that is. And it's kind
      of an experiment in decoupling me as not being a composer or really involved in the composition of the project, of the, of the music, except for, you know, setting up the software that, that does it. And so I have no ego involved in the
      composition and I was just a client and I could actually, people could discuss it and I would have no idea what they're talking about.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Wow. All right. Well, that might actually solve your feeding, the masses exactly. Situation without having to get personally involved. I like the, I like this out of that. Well, Matthew, it's been fantastic as always to talk
        to you. I appreciate you taking the time out to, subject yourself to this interview. And, any last, any last notes for the listeners? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Matthew: </b>No, I just, I would like to say thank you for this opportunity. And, it was wonderful speaking to you.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>All right. Great. Thank you very much. Have a great day. Bye-bye.</i>
