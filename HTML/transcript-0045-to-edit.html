<b>Darwin: </b>Today's podcast is actually really kind of a privilege for me. Tommy Dogg is somebody that I've, seen on the internet for about as long as I've been on the internet. And so when I had an opportunity to talk to him about some other things, I raised the option of talking to us on the podcast as well. This is gonna be interesting for me because while I've seemed to have been around Tommy a lot, I didn't know a lot about him or about his work. I've run into him at trade shows and stuff, but I really wanted to learn more. So, luckily Tommy was willing to give up an hour of his time to have a chat and it was really quite fascinating. I hope you enjoy. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright, today we are going to meet someone that is sort of an internet legend to me. I first ran across him on the Max News list. He stood out because where everyone else would have things like, hi, I am Professor X, Y, Z here was Tommy <span style="color:red" data-ts="71.4" data-end_ts="71.62" title="71.4" id=c_"71.4">__Dog__</span>. So Tommy Dogg was, was a part of the, max, <span style="color:red" data-ts="74.88" data-end_ts="75.1" title="74.88" id=c_"74.88">__was__</span> like going back to the McGill days, I think. And and it was really fun to kind of follow, follow him as he was like getting his arms around what, was happening with Max. And then I ran into him at the AEs Show. I got a great story about that. Basically I was at the focal press booth. I was going through their books and this arm reaches in front of me to get a book and tattooed across the arm is the words Tommy Dog 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And I was like, oh, I know who that is, <laugh>. And, it seems like we have occupied the same virtual space for as long as there's been an internet, because right now he's active on the Muff Wiggler site, which is, where I hang out for the modular gear pile. We just kinda run the same circles, but we are very different people. And so, I really wanted to take the opportunity to talk to Tommy, have him talk a little bit about his work and also sort of his aesthetic and the way that he pulls together a diverse set of influences to do what he does. So, hi Tommy. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy Dogg: </b>I'm all right. How are you doing today? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I had a long day. It was soccer day with the kid a little bit. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>That's, that's real life. That's, that's where the, that's where the art comes from, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I guess. So I, I, well, I hope, I hope it does, because otherwise I just shot a day <laugh>. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>Well, well I, I'd like to think at least during Theder, you know, from <span style="color:red" data-ts="170.12" data-end_ts="170.54" title="170.12" id=c_"170.12">__hither__</span> to VI or, or what have you, you're, you are at least doing some coding or something, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? Well, I, I definitely, whenever I, whenever I do like one of these daylong tracks, it does seem like I come back with a head full of stuff. So that's a, that's actually a really good point. So let's kick this off by having you tell us a little bit about your artistic work, kind of the broad, the whole range of it, if you don't mind. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>I'm a couple of things and a lot of people are a little confused as as to what I am and what I do. So I'm gonna sort of break it down into the most simple way that I can. I am a fan collector and I am a musician and I'm a musician technician. So I do studio work and I collect things like musical instruments and records. And like most musicians, I also do some art. And because of the various technologies that musicians come in contact with beyond their distortion pedal, I got into the recording studio and the ideas that I had just kept mutating my background is punk, so I always wanted to find new ways of doing things, which put me in this odd place of being a guy who likes three chord dummy rock, who wants to then do programming to make a machine do three chord dummy rock <laugh> so I can learn how to play with that machine. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>And sort of out of that, I've grown into experimenting with building a robot who can't play drums very well. And I've gotten into projection devices and sort of, I've touched upon sort of all the things that a musician deals well, okay, most musicians don't deal with robots, but tomorrow is the future and we will be dealing with robots. But everything else I deal with is the technology that is around any musician. It's just that I actually take the time to learn a little bit about the language so I can kind of get what I want from a lighting person or from the studio or whatever. And I just sort of take my being a Dante a little bit too far <laugh> as I did with Max and everywhere else I go. Is that, is that a <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's a pretty good thing. It's what, what are some specific, works that you've been, you've been involved in, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>Specific works recently or over the years? Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Over the years. I mean, you talk about having a punk background. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>Okay. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I, how did that express itself? I, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>I got into punk in 1978 and I was 10 years old and nobody wanted to be in a band with me. And, because who the hell wants to be in a band with a 10 year old, particularly one who is extremely opinionated <laugh>. And, so I spent most of my time fighting in record shops with adults about what was relevant. And around the time, eh, at some point I started migrating into bands. And when I was 13, I took two friends of mine, neither of which were into punk, one of which was a Led Zeppelin fan. And one of them was a guy who liked disco and rap, which was somewhat cutting edge at the time. And I said, we are now a punk band. And I made a cassette recording of the three of us sitting in a room, sort of improvising music that involved yelling The song would break down, we'd start calling each other fag. And that became, that started my, my career as a professional musician because once I had pressed them, I knew I had to make money making, to pay for the pressing. So, I became a professional musician, by releasing record of three 13 year olds calling each other fag <laugh>, which would probably not sell as well now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Probably not. Although, you know, it's funny because you can take something like that and culture it in so many different ways within a certain context, it represents sort of like a performance art piece showing the essential evil of 13 year olds, maybe, you know, it could be many different things. The, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>The <span style="color:red" data-ts="454.02" data-end_ts="454.26" title="454.02" id=c_"454.02">__thing__</span>, the thing that it left me with the thing that turned me on about it, cuz it was a, it was a stupid thing that could have that any 13 year old might have done, except that I was born with severe learning dis disabilities. So I've always functioned in the world in a very broken manner. So having a musical situation where I'm playing with people who can't play. Now, I could play a little bit and one of the other guys could play better than me at this point. He can't. But I mean, I essentially formed a band with people who can't play music. And to me, having this background of non-music and trying to play sort of is what got me into jazz, what got me into listening to all kinds of different music because it's an adventure. I mean, how does somebody who plays bass decently play with somebody who's a child? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>You, you can't, it it's, and that's what actually got me ultimately a decade later around, I think version two or 2.5 with Max, was I met a, a, a gentleman who became my assistant in my recording studio and he told me about Max, he was studying at Columbia and he said, yeah, if you wanna write software that will allow your midi instruments to play three notes over and over again that they randomly choose. And I said, oh my God, <laugh>, it's perfect for me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="555.37" data-end_ts="555.86" title="555.37" id=c_"555.37">__Because__</span> it set up a surprise, which I then had to leap into and, and try to make the best stuff, which is kind of how life is for me. Since, if you're learning disabled, you are constantly at odds with the world. And I don't know whether that is a coherent tangent or not, but the brain people's name of that band, and, and that's sort of how I, from that is sort of the, the egg in which everything I do sort of comes from because everything is about dealing with chaotic circumstances and trying to address them all. My max work is about creating devices out of random number generators <span style="color:red" data-ts="604.3" data-end_ts="604.46" title="604.3" id=c_"604.3">__or__</span> pseudo random number generators and having effect processors or synths that surprised me. Basically cuz the two guys really don't want to be in this band is now over 30 years later. And, which is why I'm building the robot 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>Even as blue eyes match the drummer who, can't play either. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, so the perfect replacement, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>The only thing, I can't get this robot to do that the, and you can might be able to help me cause I know you're pretty swift with the Arduino, is that the drummer has a bit, has a bit of a substance abuse issue and tends to do a lot of vomiting and I haven't been able to figure out a way of setting up pneumatic pumps that maybe in time can vomit with music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that would be, that would be a winner. I have to, I have to tell you, it's funny that you, you talk about this robotic drum thing cuz I actually have a robotic drum story, back in, I'm guessing 1990 mm-hmm. <affirmative>, 1991, something like that. I had just moved to the big city, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Woohoo. And, I was Are you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>Friends? Are you friends with Grant? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yes. Very. I have a long history with Grant, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>Actually. I love Grant. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I used to <laugh>, but anyway, <laugh> we'll talk about 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>That someday. Are are you gonna interview him? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What's that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>Are you gonna interview him? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm not sure that we're on speaking terms in an appro a good enough way where that could happen. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, it's one of those things. I mean, I'm sure that he's, we each wish that we could replace the other with robots in our lives, but there you go. But yeah, so I moved to Milwaukee and I, I was trying to set up my, little midi studio. I just was just out of a divorce. I was trying to like, make my perfect life and I badly needed a drum machine. One day in the, newspaper, a drum machine comes up for sale. The one I was interested at the time, a Roland r eighth, <span style="color:red" data-ts="747.46" data-end_ts="747.58" title="747.46" id=c_"747.46">__I__</span> going for really cheap. So I call up the guy, I'm like, oh man, Roland R eight really cool, <span style="color:red" data-ts="754.14" data-end_ts="754.26" title="754.14" id=c_"754.14">__r__</span> is it still for sale? He's like, yeah, come and get this piece of crap. So I'm like, okay, I'll do it. Just don't sell it before I get there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I drive over and and I knock on the door and I'm like, I'm here for the drum machine. He's like, oh, the piece of crap. I'm like, yeah. Okay. I think it's actually a pretty cool machine, but I'm happy to buy it off of you. So, does it work? And everything, he's like, as far as I can tell, it works, but for my purposes it's a piece of crap. And I'm, as I'm sensing a theme here, right? I'm like, so what were you trying to do that that wasn't, wasn't working? He's like, well, I was making a robotic drummer. I'm like, really? That sounds awesome. And he's like, yeah, and this rolling <span style="color:red" data-ts="802.1" data-end_ts="802.3" title="802.1" id=c_"802.1">__mox__</span> is supposed to have like human humanizing characteristics that I wanted to use. And I was like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="807.6" data-end_ts="807.82" title="807.6" id=c_"807.6">__ah__</span>, interesting. That's really cool. It's like, let's go out in a garage, I'll get you <span style="color:red" data-ts="811.46" data-end_ts="811.62" title="811.46" id=c_"811.46">__the__</span> machine. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So we walk out, we walk out to <span style="color:red" data-ts="815.02" data-end_ts="815.14" title="815.02" id=c_"815.02">__his__</span> garage and to get to the place where the drum, machine actually was, I had to wade through, this enormous pile of punctured drum heads, <laugh>. I would, I mean, these are piles taller than my head, just hundreds and hundreds of drum heads with <laugh> holes <span style="color:red" data-ts="840.15" data-end_ts="840.5" title="840.15" id=c_"840.15">__spoke__</span> in 'em, because he never could quite calibrate the, the, the pneumatics to do exactly what he wanted. And so I think in the end he decided it was all that crap rolling drum machine that was causing the great big problem. But, that's, I, I don't know if that many people that have robotic drum, robot robot drum machine stories. So I thought that it would be worth sharing. Anyway, <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>It, it makes me wanna sort of see what, if there are any outputs on the, I have a, <span style="color:red" data-ts="878.18" data-end_ts="878.3" title="878.18" id=c_"878.18">__a__</span> R <span style="color:red" data-ts="878.62" data-end_ts="878.82" title="878.62" id=c_"878.62">__eight__</span> M here still. Yeah. I wonder if I could, you know, I don't know, do something with that to get this guy, this guy to be a little bit more, ambitious <laugh>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="893.05" data-end_ts="893.54" title="893.05" id=c_"893.05">__Because__</span> I mean, the vomiting thing is like, I, I, I, at this point, I'm not even looking at that code. It's just, it's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b><laugh> it's the trick actually with now unlike, unlike you and most people who do stuff like this, I really don't know what I'm doing. And in fact, my aforementioned learning disabilities, which are brain damage, mean that I can't do math. So everything I do is literally, like, I'm sitting there with the proverbial apple tossing it up in the air and waiting for it to hit me in the head so I can figure out how stuff goes. So there's a lot of explosions, there's a lot of magic blue smoke, there's a lot of real, like I've already blown out an Arduino board. But <span style="color:red" data-ts="942.49" data-end_ts="942.78" title="942.49" id=c_"942.49">__what__</span> I did learn, which could be helpful to somebody building some idiot who wants to build a robot drummer is whether you're using solenoids or or servo motors, is make sure that you're doing the striking is at a little bit of an angle because you're less, you're more likely to get a little bit of a bounce back and a little bit more freedom. And so it'll sort of scrape the drum head and will make the drum noise without actually poking a hole in it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, there you go. I mean, that probably could have saved Mr. Milwaukee drum, robot guy an awful lot of headaches cuz it was clear that he had pneumatics that were just like pounding their way right through the drum head. I mean, I just, I just think back to that and I was like, I wonder how many thousands of dollars of drum headss that was sitting in the, in the garage. It was hilarious. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>Well, but it was the nineties and I think we all had a little bit more money at that time 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1001.34" data-end_ts="1001.38" title="1001.34" id=c_"1001.34">__little__</span> bit more money. And, and I think to actually to continue punching holes through the same drum heads probably requires a pretty significant, a pretty stiff intake of of drugs and alcohol too. Right? <laugh>. I have a feeling that there was some of that involved. You know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>I don't think personally that I could be drinking and doing any of this stuff. I mean, I know that I banned alcohol from any kind of soldering situation, because there have been too many bad incidences, that I decided that I already have enough things going against me without actually adding alcohol to the mix. Now I'm not saying you shouldn't drink alcohol, I'm just saying you should do it after you solder <laugh> or, or a few hours before. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>But not during. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I think, I think one of the things that's really scary with soldering is that once you've been doing it for a while, you forget that you have a a 700 degree poker in your hand. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>Not me. I burn myself. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, yeah, I know I do too. But it's always sort of like, oh, my eye itches and I reach up and, and all of a sudden I've burnt the bridge of my nose <laugh>. Right. Not a good plan. Yeah. So I can't imagine that that drinking with that is gonna actually work out, out to the best. So I wanna explore a little bit, about this idea of, of your learning disability and how that might have actually informed you doing the things the way you do them. How does this disability, express itself? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>It's a, it's a number of different things, but they're essentially like dyslexia, dysgraphia, dyscalculia. Okay. So I have, the one thing I have going for me is I have, or two things, long <span style="color:red" data-ts="1122.14" data-end_ts="1122.3" title="1122.14" id=c_"1122.14">__term__</span> memory and the language skill, everything else about me is virtually subhuman my math skills, maybe third <span style="color:red" data-ts="1130.1" data-end_ts="1130.42" title="1130.1" id=c_"1130.1">__grade__</span>, third grade level. I have spatial perceptive issues and I have problems with many different functions where messages have to bounce back and forth between the two hemispheres. And it's possible that there's damage to the corpus callosum. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>So what happens, for example, is if I, I've never learned to read music. I can't, I can hear it in my head and I can play it. I can hear something once and play it, but I cannot actually read, I can't translate it into any kind of graphic. If I were to sit down and read something and then turn and write, try to write something about what I just read, I could not do it. So there's a problem with going from one discipline to the other, in very, very specific ways. I mean, the, the rest of it is mostly your day-to-day existence. I go into a grocery store, I recognize things by the package because my instinct is not to look at the words. The important thing is that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1207.61" data-end_ts="1207.81" title="1207.61" id=c_"1207.61">__Mi__</span> Mr. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1208.05" data-end_ts="1208.37" title="1208.05" id=c_"1208.05">__Bubble__</span> hasn't changed the package that much. <laugh>, I mean, they ruined, they ruined him 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>From cartoon standpoint, but they haven't changed the package. So I can actually buy Mr. Bub. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that's good. That kind of puts, a framework around it because that is really extensive, especially when you're working with music. You know, there's, there are so many different ways that there are visual components to, to music. So there's sort of the standard notation. But there's also, you know, when you're working on a timeline in music software, there's the functional blocks and the timeframes, there's all of the left to right orientation with markers and tracks and all that stuff. How mind boggling is that to you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>Well, I'm actually considered an extremely good digital editor. I do, in fact, a lot of, what, what was the movie? Was it Pulp Fiction where Harvey Cartel plays the guy who's like the cleanup guy? Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's the one. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>I get a lot of gigs where an older punk band, from the seventies or early eighties, I get hired by a label who's doing, let's say, an archival thing, and there's a portion of the tape that may be damaged. And so a song needs to actually be rearranged in a way that doesn't sound like it was rearranged. Sure. And they hire me and they pay me. And I don't take a credit because nobody wants to think that the record they're listening to has been doctored in that manner, particularly with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1307.1" data-end_ts="1307.22" title="1307.1" id=c_"1307.1">__that__</span> music. Right. So with digital editing, for some reason, that works for me. And, but I don't, you know, I don't pay a lot of attention to the actual grid, the timeline. I don't work in that way. So I think if I were, I pay attention to what I know to pay attention to and kind of block out the other stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So what is, what is the stuff that you key off of? Is it the shape of the wave form? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>Shape of the wave form, and I use my ears uhhuh. I mean, I've been mixing records since I was 13, so I, I know what I'm listening for. I also know, particularly for not dealing with disco, you know, to hear a, a, you know, loose rock and roll type of track, you have to feel it. You can't really make it just on the money. It has to sort of sound good. And I spend all my free time listening to records, so I know what it's supposed to sound like. So it's just a question of nudging things until they sound right. So it's not, it's not actually that difficult as long as I ignore all the numbers, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Well, but that seems to be something that runs completely afoul to how people want to work these days. At one point I did some, I, I had written some plugins, right. And I very specifically did not put, specific timing indicators or specific frequencies cutoffs for the filters or whatever, because I wanted to very much preference the use of your ears over the use of your eyes and your intellectual background. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>People hated it. I had a lot of people who were like very adamant that I was, messing up their ability to get their sound. And I was like, what the heck are you talking about? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1422.77" data-end_ts="1423.06" title="1422.77" id=c_"1422.77">__Well__</span>, I'm gonna, I wanna, I wanna, I can solve this <laugh> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1426.96" data-end_ts="1427.16" title="1426.96" id=c_"1426.96">__well__</span>, I'll solve it, but this is gonna be, this is gonna be the big thing that people are gonna learn from this particular podcast.

<b>Darwin: </b>Well, thank you so much. I I needed to hear that <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>Well, it's, I mean, that's what's gonna sell this whole thing because Right. The rest of the story is about a mental cripple and it makes robots that don't work <laugh>. But yeah, that's really the problem. And, and people want everything handed to them. And you know what, most people don't really know what those numbers are anyway. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>They don't, or, or the other thing is, is it somehow makes, I mean, to me, sometimes things like the exact frequency of a filter cutoff, first of all, that's completely arbitrary. I mean, in a mathematical way that means something. But in an Audi Audible way, it's, it's kind of a, there's a lot of wiggle room there, but secondly, I get this feeling like they <span style="color:red" data-ts="1489.12" data-end_ts="1489.4" title="1489.12" id=c_"1489.12">__wanna__</span> see it. It, it is sort of like the numeric version of, the walnut side panels that people put on plugins. Right, right. It like makes them somehow feel like, it's real gear. And I just, that makes me sad sometimes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>Well, this may also be a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1510.32" data-end_ts="1510.48" title="1510.32" id=c_"1510.32">__news__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1510.48" data-end_ts="1510.76" title="1510.48" id=c_"1510.48">__slash__</span> it kind of isn't anything that, that, you anything that you can't actually physically lift and move from one place to another. I mean, are computers real? Yeah. But, anything that's, if you can't go and recreate a musical situation 20 years later, it's hard for me to feel the same kind of relationship I have with hardware. And I know that that's counter where we are in the world, but I'm somebody who listens to LPs and, well, I listen <span style="color:red" data-ts="1551.32" data-end_ts="1551.44" title="1551.32" id=c_"1551.32">__to__</span> Moosa 45, but I, you know Right. I feel like, and, and I'm somebody who does actually keep going a lot of older computers, because there are plugins, there are things that I want to continue using and technology marches on in this very cruel way, leaving behind some great plugins. And, you know, it's a, it's a tough, it's a tough position to be in when you've, whether you've spent money on it, whether you've built it yourself to have to go, oh yeah, I can't do that anymore. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Or especially if it's some way you've like staked your artistic voice on something that's no longer technologically viable. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>All those artists who, who decided that they were gonna be using Cantos, that was a, it was one of those plugins. Oh, okay. Nobody used it except for me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, I know. But that was, that was, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>It was cool looking 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Though. It was cool looking. And it was, the, the thing with Cantos is you had to very particularly not be, not be focused on getting what you thought you were gonna get. And in a way, it sounds like it was probably the perfect plugin for you because you talk about how you like being surprised by the system and then have having to jump in with it. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>Well, except that with Cantos, it had such a specific sound. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>And, you know, I'm familiar enough with let's say hardware where I'll do a song and I'll say, you know, the guitar needs to be that 62 Jazz Master going through the four knob fender blender. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>I mean, I hear it in my head and I go, that's what it needs to be. So the surprises need to be like, I've played with people who play really fucking well, and I'm okay. I've been, at times, I've been terrible at times. I'm, I'm okay. I'm an okay player. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> as a guitarist and as a bassist I'm okay. But when you play with somebody who's really excellent, it's a, you're flying by the seat of your pants. It's a, it's just an amazing, wonderful thing. And the same for me as playing when I've tried to play music with children or with my two oldest friends, God forbid, they'll listen to this podcast, <laugh>. But, it's anything that, that is not is, is not me, is me trying to relate to the world. So I'm, I'm sort of fighting to either be better or worse, I guess. But it's, it is the same challenge one way or the other. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>So yeah, Cantos didn't work for me. <laugh> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1733.14" data-end_ts="1733.26" title="1733.14" id=c_"1733.14">__every__</span> piece, but the, the one piece of software I really, it killed me that it didn't move forward, was Sonic Works artist that I Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I, that was, that was one of those plugin packages and it was like such a broad base of, of, little bits and pieces mm-hmm. <affirmative>, but I remember like sitting with my Mac 66 or six 60 av like going through each one and tweaking little things to hear. They had like oddball stuff, like the anti reverbs and stuff like that. Right. That were just so creatively fun and Yeah. That, that never made the leap to OS 10, did it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>No, no. In fact, I have an os I keep an OS nine machine just for that. Oh, wow. I, I have that with Plug <span style="color:red" data-ts="1783.54" data-end_ts="1783.66" title="1783.54" id=c_"1783.54">__O__</span> in it and maybe hypno maybe in that as well. There 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You go. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>But I mean, that's it, you know, that's the only reason that I have that OS nine machine really is for that. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Now, if, if we talk about the concept of, you know, sort of making, making work that's gonna last over the long term, this also seems to kind of butt into a lot of work that you're interested in or you're kind of working with, you know. So first of all, my assumption is that a lot of this recording work that you're doing with, punk, punk bands, perspec, especially like archival information is all working on tape. So I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1830.98" data-end_ts="1831.1" title="1830.98" id=c_"1830.98">__am__</span>, my assumption is you still have your hand in tape a bit, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>Well, I, I do. Usually what happens is someone delivers a, depending on when it was transferred, usually it's been baked and transferred at some point. Very often, the band, somebody in the band at some point did something else where they had money. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, okay. And, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>And they had a big label or something behind them, and they snuck in and got the tape baked and they transferred it to DAT 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Oh, nice. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>And so they bring me a DAT tape or they bring me a cdr. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>So I, I generally try to save the tape for when it's necessary, Uhhuh <affirmative>, and it's very often not necessary. And I also like to keep the budget under control. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, I hear that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>So I'll get the, the material usually in a digital form, and then I, I sit down, usually I'll do it in pro tools, you know, I'll do it as a two track. You know, I might spread it out a little bit just to, just to get those little, little mistakes lined up properly. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, but, you know, I do it like anybody else, with the exception that I don't look at the numbers. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>I think, I think I was, I was actually thinking about the, I think the best example for the, where the numbers come into play in a negative really negative way, or where I can't get around it, is like when you're dealing with robotics and you have a servo motor, and you are told that it has this amount of torque 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>For me to understand how much force it's going to use at what speed it's going, plus the electrical of how much power it needs, it becomes a jumbled mess in my head. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>And usually it involves me buying, continually buying better and better servos until I got have one that actually hits the drum or, or whatever it's supposed to do in a way that I'm satisfied. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>So those kind of things where you're dealing with science at a level that's well beyond my education or experience. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. But to a certain extent, the, whether it's the maker community or the creative coding community or whatever, they've kind of put together things so you can at least experiment with them. So it wasn't that long ago where if you wanted to do a microprocessor controlled anything, you better have your EE degree polished up mm-hmm. <affirmative> because you're gonna need every bit of it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>Yeah, absolutely. No, I'm, I'm sort of in a lucky position because I was the dumb guy with the loud mouth at, at max 2.0, who David happened to, to have a soft spot for. And so I never got thrown off the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2025.58" data-end_ts="2025.78" title="2025.58" id=c_"2025.58">__forum__</span>. And also I'm not ashamed of saying, I have no idea how to do this, or ask the same question over and over until I get, you know, I'm not, I don't have a problem saying I'm not, I'm not like you guys, I'm not educated, nor do I have this skill base, but this is what I'm trying to do, and all I can do is hope that the idea I have is interesting or funny enough that somebody will say, you know what? I'm gonna help this kid because 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. It'll, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2059.79" data-end_ts="2060.14" title="2059.79" id=c_"2059.79">__it'll__</span> capture their attention. Right? Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>Yeah. Yeah. And I had so many people, reach out to me in that max community and give me little bits of code and, and all of that. And I mean, some of them I'll talk to years later, they don't remember helping me. Right. I remember Jen, is it <span style="color:red" data-ts="2081.2" data-end_ts="2081.42" title="2081.2" id=c_"2081.2">__Jen__</span> or Jen? It'll be embarrassing when, if he ever listens to the, podcast, but I, I didn't even know at the time. He was a member of the pos Okay. Really nice guy. Did, did really went way out of his way. David also went way out of his way for me. There <span style="color:red" data-ts="2103.9" data-end_ts="2104.06" title="2103.9" id=c_"2103.9">__was__</span> a lot of really great people in that community. I, I think, and I think that the modern modular synth world is very similar to that. I think you have a lot of people who actually like helping each other. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So, so let's talk about that a little bit. What, what engagement do you have with modulars? I know, we kind of got reconnected because you were selling, or you were thinking about selling some lzx gear, so, well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>You, you forget that I was involved with the Manta, so, which 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, that's right. Of course. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>Yeah. And, and the, I know that you, you had done that, that nice interface, was that, or did you just 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Do No, that was, hand 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2149.06" data-end_ts="2149.34" title="2149.06" id=c_"2149.06">__Bone__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I did, I did a thing where it was, it basically allowed you use it as a strumming surface. I think you're thinking of the honeycomb thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>Right. So that wasn't yours. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>No, that was, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>You did the strumming surface. Did you also do an the Max <span style="color:red" data-ts="2166.14" data-end_ts="2166.26" title="2166.14" id=c_"2166.14">__O__</span> object? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>No, Luke Dubbo was working mostly with that. So Luke, I helped do with some testing on it, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2172.98" data-end_ts="2173.18" title="2172.98" id=c_"2172.98">__Kept__</span> your feet up and didn't do anything here. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, thanks. Thanks a lot for that. I really needed to hear that today. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>Well, considering how, Jeff talked, I had the sense that you were quite involved. So he may think that you were doing all kinds of stuff, or, or he certainly was quite happy with whatever 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Else. Well, yeah, I think I, I think a lot of it was that, when I saw, when I first saw it, it really, it really rang some bells for me because it was the first thing I saw. I have, I have real problems with my hands. My hands now are getting to a point that I have to be very careful about anything where I'm doing impact hits. Right. But it had already started to be a problem then. And when he first showed me the surface, I was like intrigued because it was the first time I could interact with <span style="color:red" data-ts="2225.26" data-end_ts="2225.42" title="2225.26" id=c_"2225.26">__the__</span> controller that wasn't either a grab and move kind of thing, nor was it an impact thing. I could just brush my hand across it. Right. Yeah. And so I started talking to him a lot about what that meant to me. I had mocked up this, this strumming surface mm-hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative>, and then he had brought the Manta out to an X, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2247.05" data-end_ts="2247.34" title="2247.05" id=c_"2247.05">__that__</span> first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_%2774">Cycling '74</a> expo. And, I had, it was really early stages, but I had my little thing where I made like a little, it was basically an auto harp, you know, for, for the Manto. And, I helped him set that up and I showed it to a bunch of people and people's eyes lit up. And I think about half of the mantis he ever sold, were in one way or another related to that, to that show and tell that he did where we were doing it. So he 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>Also, you know, it speaks his language because he has a deep connection with traditional instruments and, and interfacing electronics and making electronic instruments that, that borrow from traditional instruments. So I think that that <span style="color:red" data-ts="2302.12" data-end_ts="2302.34" title="2302.12" id=c_"2302.12">__the__</span> idea of strumming it really connected with him. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Probably so. Well, and it's funny because you look at his, the other instruments he's made. Yeah. And all of it looks like, you know, some sort of crazy, steampunk combination of the 18 hundreds and the 20, you know, 22nd century, right? Yeah. So it's, it's craziness. He's, he's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>One of, he's one of those, the people that I think is one of the most sting designers out there now. I, he and I have some definite disagreements. Like the whole Manta <span style="color:red" data-ts="2341.22" data-end_ts="2341.46" title="2341.22" id=c_"2341.22">__mate__</span> thing came about because I really felt like u sb is a disposable thing and it's connected to my computer and I don't want it. Right. I want this thing to be standalone. And we kept <span style="color:red" data-ts="2355.24" data-end_ts="2355.46" title="2355.24" id=c_"2355.24">__ta__</span> I kept bugging him about it, like, can't you make, you know, and I was saying like, make a Manta survival box, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2363" data-end_ts="2363.22" title="2363" id=c_"2363">__cuz__</span> I love the Manta, right. But I don't want to attach, I don't want to make music always in front of the computer. And so I, I was just bugging him to find even the most bare bones way of doing this so that the Manta could live on beyond just like the plugin so it could live on beyond, it's it's current stage. And that's, that sort of turned into the man <span style="color:red" data-ts="2392.62" data-end_ts="2392.82" title="2392.62" id=c_"2392.62">__to__</span> made. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well now, getting back to the modular thing, okay. Again, that really kind of points to this idea of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2401.16" data-end_ts="2401.38" title="2401.16" id=c_"2401.16">__ha__</span> having music, making devices that are not necessarily built for immediate disposability. Now in preparation for this, you pointed me actually to, the Optic Kinetics, solar two 50 effects projector. Right. Which was, it was fun to see that. And actually I think that I've seen, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>I got a pile of them here. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, do you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I think that it's something that I run into occasionally. When I go to like old planetarium, they have them like, you know, in the rim around the planetarium, they'll have lots of little weird 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2444.12" data-end_ts="2444.34" title="2444.12" id=c_"2444.12">__The__</span> star projectors. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, yeah. But, at least some of the optical ones that I've seen also had effects projectors too, just for when they're doing like wacky, dark sided moon night or whatever, you know, <laugh>. But, it, looking at this and then kind of, kind of, you know, tying that in with, an interest in the modular stuff, it makes me, it really gave me this sense of, sort of, a person who gets some joyfulness out of, kooky old hardware or kooky hardware, not whether it's old or new. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>Yeah. I, well, I, I mean, I originally had and still have vintage sinces, and I've always been a stomp box guy and I've always liked gizmos and I collect instruments that are bizarre, whether they're acoustic or electric or whatever. So I have, and I sort of want, I, I want everything, every possibility at my fingertips, which is not necessarily realistic, but is, you know, my nature and I got into vintage lighting. And the vintage lighting thing, also was a position where I did not know anything about it. And I, I had an opti kinetic projector that my aunt, my aunt had had like a sort of little disco in her basement <laugh>. And she was closing her house up and she said, do you want this thing? And I said, oh yeah, of course. <laugh>. And it ended up in storage and after my marriage ended, I, it was one of the things that I kind of pulled out and in, in my grief, instead of going for making an album about how fucked up and sad I was, I went and I went toward the light. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>But instead of using the, the wheels that these things come, you know, that, that were made for them, I started making my own. So I would use the prisms that, and all the electronics and stuff that come with them. And I started collecting all the ephemera and all that stuff, but I was also building my own as well. And so there is a tie between that stuff and the modular synths because the light <span style="color:red" data-ts="2597.05" data-end_ts="2597.34" title="2597.05" id=c_"2597.05">__show__</span> thing, I mean, these come from the psychedelic light shows, right. People, people started going, you know what, the whole oil thing is a fucking mess. We're not gonna do it. And mobile DJs started using things like this and small clubs started using things like this cuz they weren't messy. Right. Same thing as the, as the modular <span style="color:red" data-ts="2616.79" data-end_ts="2617.14" title="2616.79" id=c_"2616.79">__since__</span> became Minimoogs and other things like that. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Much less messy on stage. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>It's less messy and roadworthy. And I like roadworthy, even though I'm somebody who prefers the studio, I like things to be made. Well, and now that we're in this place where, companies like DOPA sort of kicked off this modular revolution, which it really in many ways is way beyond it is more of a true revolution than the original thing was. Oh, I agree. We now have stuff that doesn't fall apart. I mean yeah. It's charming that my EML 1 0 1 kind of sounds a little broken <laugh>, but it's still, I can't open it up and replace a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2673.22" data-end_ts="2673.5" title="2673.22" id=c_"2673.22">__part__</span> actually the eml particularly because the wiring is so horrible. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>You know, you can't, it's not quite the same thing. And now you have all of these companies making the modern modular since and they've opened up all sorts of doors. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2692.09" data-end_ts="2692.38" title="2692.09" id=c_"2692.09">__Yeah__</span>. They've opened up negative doors too. It personally, it makes me insane that people don't understand that a synthesizer is, contains specific components that just simply having an electronic noise is not a synthesizer. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>And is not synthesizing. If you heard that bang. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2716.25" data-end_ts="2716.54" title="2716.25" id=c_"2716.25">__Yeah__</span>. I don't know if you, did you hear that bang? I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Did. Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>There's a woman who lives above me who wears Uggs, and I sometimes write about her on the interwebs because I, I really don't like to fight with my neighbors. Cause I think you live with them, so you should try to be pleasant. Right. But whenever she does things like that, I think it was her falling over or something. <laugh>, I comment. So the woman from with the odds, just fell, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2743.82" data-end_ts="2744.06" title="2743.82" id=c_"2743.82">__Just__</span> killed over <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>Yeah. But I I I I, I do as picky as I am about the modular sim thing, I do like the fact that it makes people who are never gonna learn how to play a traditional instrument, make music. Like now you have problems with your hands now and you with the manta, you can strum all of a sudden you can do a gesture that wasn't that comfortable. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>So <span style="color:red" data-ts="2774.91" data-end_ts="2775.13" title="2774.91" id=c_"2774.91">__it__</span>, I like anything that puts art right in your hands as long as it doesn't make you do it in a very specific way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>Yeah. That makes sense. Like garage band is crap, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>You know, things like that where you really, there's no creativity. Yeah. But when non-musicians can do it, you know, it's great. I mean, obviously there's gonna be a reckoning since there's so many <span style="color:red" data-ts="2802.59" data-end_ts="2802.81" title="2802.59" id=c_"2802.59">__be__</span> records coming out at some point, all these kids are buying modular stuff right now. 90% of them are gonna dump them 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>As they get interested in something else. Maybe trading baseball cards or whatever. But technology needs to have those explosions and then, you know, Peters out and then comes back. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right.

<b>Tommy: </b>And that's what's happened with the lighting thing too, I think certainly has happened. I know with laser technology and I think robotics is also one of those things that sort of was a hobby thing, but nobody could really do it properly. And now it's computing. I mean, computing is, is, I think it's constantly a up and down thing as, as we, we experiment with something go only as far as we can go and we have to wait for technology to catch up to us. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. It's really interesting you say that. Last week I interviewed, Tim Weaver, who's a, an academic that works in media arts, and we were kind of talking about this ebb and flow as well. Now I hadn't really thought of it quite in, in the terms that you just laid it out, but, you know, a really good example of that is the whole virtual reality thing, which was, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2880.76" data-end_ts="2880.88" title="2880.76" id=c_"2880.76">__I__</span> was really groovy there for a while and then everyone got bored of it. And then the next thing you know, you know, Oculus Rift makes some, makes some technical <span style="color:red" data-ts="2890.28" data-end_ts="2890.68" title="2890.28" id=c_"2890.28">__logical__</span> advancements and mm-hmm. <affirmative> all of a sudden it's back in play again. Which is, I guess interesting. I don't know, maybe that's <laugh> you were talking about trying to find a way to make your, your, robotic drummer puke. But maybe if you gave everyone VR goggles, your audience could all puke and you wouldn't have to worry about the, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>I I've never had a problem getting the audience to puke <laugh>. That's not the issue. <laugh> the issue is that the real drummer vomits a lot and this robot doesn't. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So you're just looking for more quantity. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>And I'm thinking, American Science and Surplus having a, a sale on pneumatics. So I'm gonna probably try to rig something <span style="color:red" data-ts="2944.24" data-end_ts="2944.44" title="2944.24" id=c_"2944.24">__up__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Gonna dive into it, huh? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2948.23" data-end_ts="2948.52" title="2948.23" id=c_"2948.23">__tell__</span> me, I, we've already, I mean, it was funny because when we first started talking about this, you're like, I don't know where we're gonna come up with 45 minutes. And so now we're an hour in <laugh>. I wanna, kind of wrap it up. I don't want to use up any more of your time, but, I would like to know, because you've been doing this for a long time and because you have very peculiar interests and particularly interests that that 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>Wait, we talking about my sex life? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2976.31" data-end_ts="2976.6" title="2976.31" id=c_"2976.31">__Yeah__</span>, no, no. We're talking about instruments. Man, I don't want to, that's a different podcast. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b><laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Which I'll be calling you back at 2:00 AM for that one. No <laugh>. But, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>Yeah, I'll be wearing a fur coat. Yeah, yeah. And slippers, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And I'll be wearing a glove, but <laugh> anyway. I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2999.44" data-end_ts="2999.56" title="2999.44" id=c_"2999.44">__would__</span>, I would like to know from you, what is the most, what is the most bizarre instrument that you have or bizarre instruments of whatever type, whether it's visual or musical or whatever, and what's the thing that is, what's, what's the thing that's the white whale? What's the thing that you're looking for, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>Man? You know, <laugh> instruments are so in itself, they're so bizarre to begin with. I mean, whether I would say any number of things that Reid Gonzales has built for me, or water phones or, I mean, I have so many, I have so many, I mean, I made a series of corns out of toilet plumbing, you know, I, there's no, I mean, I collect animal hunting calls. I don't know if there is a single bizarre, thing. Probably it's probably me, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>I mean, I'm the instrument, I guess. Sure. Good point. Bizarre. The white whale might also be me. It could also be, could also be a, matrix mixer for my <span style="color:red" data-ts="3079.68" data-end_ts="3079.9" title="3079.68" id=c_"3079.68">__mug__</span>. You know, I haven't <laugh> I've been very lucky and I I have not, I I've always had dreams that I could, that were just a little bit out of my reach. Right. And so I've been able to do things including building a Moog one module at a time. So I don't know that there's a white whale there, there's always a white whale, but there isn't one at this moment. I'd like an electric banjo, one of the, one of the Tyco ones. Oh, sure. There's always something. I mean, I'm a collector, so every day of my life there are packages arriving with 40 fives in 'em. There's constantly parts and, and records coming into my house. My wife left me because of this or part of it anyway. The other part was the flippers and the fur coat. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, there is that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>Yeah. It's hard to say, but there's always a white whale. It's just, what's this week's white way <span style="color:red" data-ts="3139.1" data-end_ts="3139.26" title="3139.1" id=c_"3139.1">__off__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. I hear that. Well, it has been fascinating and you know, you've left enough in, over the course of this conversation, you've not left enough breadcrumbs that, we're gonna have to come back and talk about some of these things. But, it was fascinating to, to get a little more in depth with you than certainly I have. This is easily the longest conversation we've had, and, but it was really <span style="color:red" data-ts="3166.16" data-end_ts="3166.38" title="3166.16" id=c_"3166.16">__get__</span> great to, to have the chat and to kind of share some of this with, with the world, and to kind of, really see how you've, integrated sort of the punk philosophy of life with, technological one and all wrapped up in sort of the difficulties in life that that got dealt out. So, it was really interesting and I thank you so much for taking the time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b>I, I thank you. I've been to be in your company and to be in the company of some of the people you've interviewed. It's a big compliment, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Well thanks. Thanks a lot. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3206.88" data-end_ts="3207.1" title="3206.88" id=c_"3206.88">__All__</span> right. You have a great evening and, we'll talk again soon. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b><i><span style="color:red" data-ts="3210.72" data-end_ts="3210.94" title="3210.72" id=c_"3210.72">__All__</span> </i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, man. All right. Bye 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tommy: </b><i>Bye. </i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Wow, that was pretty incredible. As you can imagine, there's a lot of additional things I would like to dive into there. I really would like to know a little bit more about him growing up and growing through the punk world, but also at the same time embracing, sort of the techno technology end of things. Sounds pretty incredible and sounds like pretty fun life to me. So, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="3243.42" data-end_ts="3243.62" title="3243.42" id=c_"3243.42">__want__</span> to take this opportunity again, thank everybody that is listening and passing these longer to friends. Here's my call to action for this week. If you could do me a favor and just reach out to one person and say, Hey, check out these podcasts. Let's see if we can get a little jump in our, listenership. We're getting close to number 50, which is, kind of a really cool bridge point for me that'll represent roughly one year's worth of of podcasts. But also I'm gonna try and pull together a special guest for that one. So hopefully that works out. But in the meantime, keep on racking up, your listens. If you have any questions or any ideas, please reach out. I've been getting good suggestions and I'm trying to follow up on them. And, in the meantime, thanks again for listening. Drop me a line if you have anything to say. Otherwise, I'll talk to you next week. Bye.
