<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. This week I am getting to talk to somebody who, whose work I find really intriguing and who has actually captured a lot of people's attention. His name's Walker Farrell and he's kind of one of these people that is showing up like in a lot of the corners of the world that I poke around in. He's, he works, with the Make Noise Company, and so he's certainly part of that, part of my obsessions, but he's also been performing a lot at, various venues, including, some of the Modular on the Spot things, which is another one of my little passion points. And, and he's done a phenomenal nu number of releases, which always intrigues me because that means that there's somebody here who knows how to finish the game. So I'm always interested in that as well. So with that, I'm gonna say hello to Walker Farrell Hey man. How's it going? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker Farrell: </b>Hey, it's going great. Thanks for having me on. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="68.075" data-end_ts="68.365" title="68.075" id=c_"68.075">__Yeah__</span>, thanks for taking the time out to, to chat. I really appreciate it. So why don't we start off by having you just, give, I kinda gave the quick version of your bio. Why don't I have you give a little more, bit more detail, particularly, I know you came out with a release recently, so just some information about what you've been currently up to. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b>Sure. So I'm, I have a few, different musical kind of projects that I'm always working on. Oftentimes the main one being just anything that I'm doing with modular synthesizers, and that's, that is my main focus and which is great because I also work for, as you mentioned, make Noise a modular synthesizer company. So, so I get to focus on that a lot, both at work and when I have time at home as well. But the recent release that you mentioned is a little different, taking a little different path, which is, that it's a, it's a piece or a set of pieces or even more of like a performance platform that I've created using Max MSP. And it does integrate with modular to some degree, but I mostly have considered it to be computer music, so, Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="138.725" data-end_ts="138.805" title="138.725" id=c_"138.725">__I__</span> see. That was something that I worked on for a long time and kind of got to a, a, a release point on recently. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's really interesting. And you know what, this is kind of a, this is a discussion I've been having with a lot of people lately, is them taking, you know, people especially that I know in the modular world, kind of taking a break and going off and exploring some classic computer music ideas, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="165.125" data-end_ts="165.525" title="165.125" id=c_"165.125">__because__</span> there's an awful lot of area there to be explored still. What, what kind of things are you doing that, that you consider computer music ish? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b>Well, I mean, this particular piece, which I've called music for Zero point Infinity Musicians, it's, it's something that I probably couldn't really do with a modular. It's, I've, I've taken the max platform and used it to sort of create a, what I'm considering to be a, an algorithm or a, or a framework for improvisation in a computer music, environment. Generally, it's doing a lot of number crunching that would not be feasible with a modular system. And a lot of times I find that like computer music and modular aren't, they have some similarities, but I definitely take a different approach to them. But in a lot of ways I have kind of thought of in some ways things that I've done with computer music as being like, what I would do if I had a modular that was, you know, 50 times the size that it, that it can feasibly be all in my lap and I could re I could make exact calculations Right. Instead of more analog calculations, so to speak. Yeah. And I could recall it, call up presets, do calculations of different types once, once every few seconds or something like that. So there's a, a bit of kind of overlap there in my mind. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Although it's, it's interesting, you, you know, you just right there started down a little bit of the road of what are the differences between what you can do with <span style="color:red" data-ts="267.685" data-end_ts="267.805" title="267.685" id=c_"267.685">__a__</span> actual analog system and a virtualized analogs or virtualized modular system. Right? Yeah. And, you know, some of the, some of the restrictions of an analog system can be kind of interesting, but some of them are a little frustrating. The lack of the inability to come back the next day, turn on the power and know for sure that it's gonna come up the same way that you left it. It's a <span style="color:red" data-ts="293.365" data-end_ts="293.445" title="293.365" id=c_"293.365">__little__</span>, it's a little disconcerting sometimes, you know? Yes. And so often it's because, oh, you just happen to have, you know, because you like missed a ratchet on a timer or something, all of a sudden things got out of sync and now they're syncopated in a cool way. And it's hard to even intellectualize how to do that stuff with, with an analog system, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="314.505" data-end_ts="314.725" title="314.505" id=c_"314.505">__You__</span> know? Yeah, that's true. How create 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b>So one thing that, that I've kind of focused on more with when I'm doing stuff with Max to, to date, and it's always changing, but, but I've usually focused more on the, on the control and composition side. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> of, of using the MAX program and less on the sound design side. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b>Because, and one reason is I think there's already so many fantastic tools made by dedicated people for, for making sounds. I mean, for example, I mean, the synthesizers that make Noise makes, which I am lucky enough to have a hand in designing, but, we also, there's so many great plugins and stuff that I find that when, if I'm trying to design a synthesizer from scratch <span style="color:red" data-ts="360.025" data-end_ts="360.245" title="360.025" id=c_"360.025">__in__</span> Max, I'm not gonna do as good of a job as something that's already available. So I've seen it more as like, in fact, like what if I had, well, I guess you could even say that my, my framework for this piece was what if I had 60 sequencers that could all be set to the exact same values anytime I wanted to, or shift to different values. Right. So it's more like the control side of it than the, than the sound design side. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's a, that's really interesting because that actually mirrors a lot of how I like using my computer in conjunction with my other stuff, is I, I tend to think of it as sort of like my third, fourth, and fifth arm sometimes. Right. Uhhuh, I can set, I can set things up and then kind of make meta controls that allow me to control a lot bigger swaths of functionality with kind of relatively crude gestures. And that's kind of 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b>Ah, absolutely. Yeah. It's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>A, that's a neat way to work, especially if you get some overlap because then they start like messing with each other and you get this little sense of indeterminacy, which can be kind of fun. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b>Yes. Definitely. I like, the, the potential for what feels like indeterminacy when it's actually not <laugh> <laugh>, you, you give enough variables and you're getting to what feels like something that's sort of random, but you still are actually controlling everything about it. Right. I just get to the point where I like getting to that point where there are so many things I'm controlling with any given gesture that I'm not gonna know exactly what any given node or change is gonna be, but I still am controlling the overall flow of it. Right. You know, moment by moment Right 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, one of the things I know, because it's another corner of electronic music stuff that, I poked in that, that you also were in, is, is the use of the Snyder Phonics Manta, which I always found to be like one of the most responsive control surface things I'd ever laid my hand on. It was fabulous. Right. You're still using that, right? Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b>I am. Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Do you generally map map it through Max and use that for parameter control? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b>Yeah. Or do you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Use it for like a strike plate, like for notes or something? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b>It's somewhere in between. I, I kind of use it for both. So the way that I do it, <span style="color:red" data-ts="508.885" data-end_ts="509.005" title="508.885" id=c_"508.885">__I__</span>, it am Manta has a couple like shell programs that are available with it that you can use to, to do some basic things with it. One of 'em is like the, the great, the straight, just basic turn it into a MIDI controller thing. I don't use that. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> I use, what I use with it instead is the, the external object that's made for <span style="color:red" data-ts="531.105" data-end_ts="531.325" title="531.105" id=c_"531.105">__Max__</span> to, that just puts the, the data from Manta in, and then each outlet has numbers that come out based on what you touch on the Manta. So what I've done for, for the piece that I've been working on for a long time is that I'll have, most of the middle nodes are, are controlling individual notes, and then I have several different nodes on the bottom and the top, and then the sliders and buttons that do more macro type of things like transposition or selecting whole sets of instruments that are active or even selecting, different motifs that they're all gonna follow and things like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So, so basically I'm taking the input of each, from each pad, and then I'm just like mapping it to its own sub <span style="color:red" data-ts="582.685" data-end_ts="582.965" title="582.685" id=c_"582.685">__patch__</span> that does whichever thing I, I want that pad to do for the, for the algorithm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So now one of the other things that I was curious about, because these are all related to kind of your current work style, but, I'm really interested in the modular work you do, and I, I dropped into your SoundCloud page. I'll have a link up in the show notes for people to check that out. But at the very top of the page, you have a, a set that you did with Modular on the Spot, which was remarkable in, its in the number of variations that occurred throughout the course of that set. You know, and I would say one of the things that's kind of a commonality of most of your music that I've heard is the sense that it's an ever, there's like an ever-changing palette underneath whatever you're doing to generate sounds. Right? So it's almost like there's like two layers of change that are happening. The what, what's happening from a playing and note generation standpoint, but then also what's happening in the sound design palette. I mean, it seems to be changing all the time. How do you manage that in what, since you have to carry a box into modular spot <laugh>, it <span style="color:red" data-ts="654.605" data-end_ts="654.725" title="654.605" id=c_"654.605">__needs__</span> to be a finite amount of stuff <span style="color:red" data-ts="656.385" data-end_ts="656.605" title="656.385" id=c_"656.385">__and__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="656.605" data-end_ts="656.725" title="656.605" id=c_"656.605">__it__</span> won't let computers show up. So how do you get something that has that much variation out of a relatively small modular system? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b>The way that I do it now is typically what I'll do is take, I have about a 12 U system at home. I will build a patch that I'm going, that I'm planning on performing, and I'll build it with an eye to making, basically, so that every single thing that's patched has more than one thing it can do. Okay. So that, so that I can, any control that I turn will have an effect on, on a great number of things. I see. And then what I'll do is I'll take that 12 U system, and once I've like kind of gotten the patch to where it's very expressive, I will, I will start cutting out modules until I can fit it all into a six U system. So I, I only ever use a a six U system, but I've usually, I've usually built it on a 12 use system. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b>Right. Then written the pieces down, all pieces, all the patch notes. Sure. Yeah. Pulled it, pulled it, rebuilt it into a six U and then I go for basically, yeah. Like I, I want for everything to be, to have the maximum like dynamic range that I can create for any given gesture. And I also really aim toward making it so that it's unbreakable as much as possible. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Right? Like, it's not really dependent on any particular set of things being in a, in the right place. Right. Because what I've, what I had done in the past sometimes was like, I do things that, that were either really dependent on a bunch of things being tuned together or, or maybe I do things where like one sub, I had a bunch of different sub patches and I move from one thing to the next. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> I've found now that like I work best if, if everything in the system is really as interconnected as I can make it, and it's more of just like a playground that I've already played in a lot. And then for this particular performance, I'm just gonna play <span style="color:red" data-ts="776.565" data-end_ts="776.765" title="776.565" id=c_"776.565">__in__</span> it for 20 minutes, feel it out how it goes, try to make some peaks and valleys, and then when it's done, it's over. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That, that makes a lot of sense. And that also then would explain why I've done things where I've done like this segmented modular thing, and what, what tends to happen is it almost ends up being like, you know, here's act one and now here's act two, and it has a very linear flow to it. Right. Right. Your music tends to not do that. And, and it makes sense now that you explain it why that would be the case because you kind of have this big ball of complexity sitting in front of you need to start, start changing things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b>Yeah. Well, I think that a, a lot of, I see a lot of my musical, concepts are about relationships between the different components, Uhhuh, <affirmative>, and I think depending on how, how it's all strung together, you can find it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="828.845" data-end_ts="828.965" title="828.845" id=c_"828.845">__all__</span>, I feel like I'm kind of, I'm finding different types of relationships between the components. So the more interrelated it all is, the better. Sure. Also, that sort of like segmented linear thing. I know there are some people who are fantastic at doing patches like that. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, Peter Tran is one who I've seen a couple times. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, Richard Devine does that <span style="color:red" data-ts="848.485" data-end_ts="848.565" title="848.485" id=c_"848.485">__these__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="848.565" data-end_ts="848.605" title="848.565" id=c_"848.565">__days__</span>. Richard Deines 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Does that a lot. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b>And, and what I find when I do it is that each one of those patches is not as dynamic on its own <laugh>, you know? 'cause it's only a small number of things you can do with it. So instead, I really, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The other thing that I find in, in doing that, what I found was that eventually, you know, by the time I would like play with it and rehearse with it and stuff, and I'm getting close to the gig, one of those patches would end up being the one that I really like the most <laugh>. Right. And so then I'm like burning through the previous ones just to get to this one that I like. And then I sit on it too long and then I don't wanna leave. And then on the way out I'm going back to it and it just <laugh>, it ends up like messing with my, messing with me a little bit, too much messing, changing my priority play, I guess. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b>Yeah. I also find that I almost always tend to forget something that I plan to do. If I'm playing live. I'll have some kind of like vague outline and there's some really cool thing, and I'm like, and then as soon as the set's over I'm like, oh, no, I forgot to do that one thing because I get, I get, you know, it's always a different, a different mindset when you're playing live than when you're playing in your, in your studio or even prepping for a live performance or even just playing for like one or two people or something. Yeah. That's okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm kinda curious, you, mentioned that you, you agreed with me that you work at Make <span style="color:red" data-ts="930.685" data-end_ts="930.885" title="930.685" id=c_"930.685">__Noise__</span>, which is good. <laugh>, I mean, I wasn't a total idiot. Yes, I agree. But I mean, with, I noticed, I noticed you at, at trade shows and stuff, in their booth. So that's how I, I assumed that. What do you do? What do you do at Make <span style="color:red" data-ts="943.765" data-end_ts="944.005" title="943.765" id=c_"943.765">__Noise__</span>? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b>Well I, my current position is of Instrument Specialist, which is kind of a vague title. It's evolved over the years. For a long time I was production manager, which meant that I headed up the production crew, did a lot of ordering of parts and just basically making sure that we had the inventory of things that we needed to sell, and then making sure that everybody knew how to properly test stuff. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, we've handed a lot of those duties over to somebody else at this point, and my job has been focused much more into the, the instrument, I guess, support, support for stuff that we already have out in the field. I see. <span style="color:red" data-ts="991.705" data-end_ts="991.905" title="991.705" id=c_"991.705">__So__</span>, so I make, I make videos for our YouTube channel, typically at least one per week. And I, I still train the crew members on quality control procedures and calibration. I work with Tony, the founder on and head engineer on, on new product designs. And I do a lot of going to events and representing the company. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And we also have started holding some, some like educational workshops and other events around town for, for people who are less, already versed in this kind of thing, kind of spreading the word in that way. That's cool as well. So yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Given that you work at Make Noise, what percentage of your modular rig is make Noise Pieces? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b><laugh>? For my personal system, it's probably about 75 or 80%, something like that. Cool. I was just, I have a, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I just, I always wonder about that because it's like, you know, is it uncomfortable if you like buy a braids or something <laugh>? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b>No, no, no. It's, it's, you know, we're, it's not, you know, it's Make Noise is, is definitely within the, the Eurorack format. And we, we realize that everything that we make is made to work with, with anything else that's in that, that format too. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1070.185" data-end_ts="1070.405" title="1070.185" id=c_"1070.185">__We__</span>, you know, make Noise has been around long enough that we make a full system and you can do a full system with just make noise. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And we definitely encourage that for whoever's, whoever's into that <laugh>. And I do that quite a bit, but I do have a few, a few choice pieces that, you know, over time have kind of made it into my rack and stayed there for a really long time. I always use the, the four MS Peg pretty, that's pretty heavy on that performance we were talking about a minute ago. Sure. I have some dope <span style="color:red" data-ts="1103.065" data-end_ts="1103.285" title="1103.065" id=c_"1103.065">__for__</span> stuff that is indispensable for what I do as well. And, and I've always liked the, synthesis technology stuff as well. Morphing terrarium, the, and the, quad temporal shifter. Those are both, those are both pretty, pretty integral to my rig. But yeah, it is mostly make noise though. Sure. It all is kind of so well designed to work exactly together, and I use it so much at work and have used it in my own practice for such a long time that I just, it's, it's all just like second nature to me at this point. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You're, you're a musician. You are, you've done, you know, work in the mi industry, music industry, you're quite an accomplished trainer slash video maker. You seem really comfortable talking and, and kind of educating, teaching people this stuff. What is the background that you have that kind of brings, you know, brought all those things to the table to kind of put you in a spot that you're in now? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b>Well, I had a roundabout path to where I am now, <laugh>. I have always been into music. I was really interested in it from a young age. And when I was a kid, I took piano lessons and, I learned how to, I also knew how to play the guitar and I poked around with making music and, and messing with sound in computers as well when I was a kid. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, in a really non rigorous sort of way, taking like primitive sound editing programs and just, just drag <span style="color:red" data-ts="1203.325" data-end_ts="1203.485" title="1203.325" id=c_"1203.325">__and__</span> dropping stuff and making collages and things like that. And I messed with like early stuff, like rebirth and stuff like that, but I never really started using a computer or hardware synthesizers either of those things for like any, in any serious way. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1219.835" data-end_ts="1220.125" title="1219.835" id=c_"1219.835">__Till__</span> later when I was about 18, I discovered, or I was in some store guitar center type store, I think, I think it was a guitar center. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b>There was an <span style="color:red" data-ts="1230.085" data-end_ts="1230.125" title="1230.085" id=c_"1230.085">__m__</span> Corg MS 2000 in there. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And that was the first like nobby synth that I really played. Okay. And I decided that I needed that <laugh> saved up, saved up my money for it. And, and my folks split it with me as a graduation present. And that was kind of like sending me into the, the, the deep end for a while, just turning knobs and seeing what happened when I was in college. I played that in a band along with other keys and stuff. And then, I actually didn't really study music in college. I took some, some classes, and actually that was where I first encountered Max too, was in college. It must've been on version three or four or something. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And at the time, I don't think I really quite got it. I don't, I don't think I really understood what the appeal of Max was. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b>I was really just end playing notes at the time still. Right. Even if I like to tweak them into oblivion. Sure. But, so I studied philosophy in college, which left me with a lot of concepts in my head, but not a lot of job opportunities. So then I worked in hospitality industry for a pretty long time where I think that's where I kind of maximize my off the cuff conversational <laugh> approach because just, finding myself talking to all kinds of people about all kinds of different things and usually without any choice in the matter. Right. So I never really, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1318.165" data-end_ts="1318.285" title="1318.165" id=c_"1318.165">__I__</span> don't really have a background in education per se. I think I just naturally like explaining things to people and being friendly while I'm doing it. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>One of the things that has to happen in, in order to kind of be an informal teacher is that you have to really understand the concepts cold. Right. Because then what you're gonna do is, you know, in a conversational way, you're gonna introduce people slowly to things that they don't understand, but you're hoping you can kind of talk 'em through. Was it literally just you worked the MS 2000 until you understood all of the tenets of synthesis? Or did you do any kind of study? Or did you like, dive into books or like hoard, keyboard magazine issues, <laugh>? How did you, how did you come to the point of having that level of facility with synthesis? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b>I, I think it's kind of a combination of all that stuff. I mean, I'm really, really into just research and learning in general. Almost any topic that I find any interest in, I will research the hell out of it. I'll get every book I can on it and find out everything that there is to know about it. And that's true not just of, of synthesis at all. I mean, it's true of all kinds of, philosophical and historical topics that I've been interested in over the years. And music generally, I mean, I, I know a ton about different, of the history of different types of music and stuff, and that all kind of ties in with it as well. So I know that I, I spent a lot of time doing things like reading manuals and trying out different, different synthesizers. Once I was kind of a, a private citizen in my twenties and had some disposable income, I did a lot of like buying and selling of synthesizers. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And it wasn't for a while, even after that, that I really discovered that modular was an option. But, but once I did that, kind of kicked it into high gear because it's possible to buy and sell and trade like little bits at a time. Right. And it doesn't, it's not quite as a big of a budgetary thing if it's a little bit at a time. And I would learn, I would buy or trade for something, learn, learn it really well, get a bunch of new knowledge out of it and then move on to the next right thing. So I did, I did that kind of like Franken constantly evolving Franken <span style="color:red" data-ts="1464.455" data-end_ts="1464.805" title="1464.455" id=c_"1464.455">__synth__</span> thing for, for several years while I was kind of figuring out how it all worked. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So the MS 2000 was your first, snobby synth. What was your first modular? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b>My first modular was actually, synthesizers.com five <span style="color:red" data-ts="1481.725" data-end_ts="1481.845" title="1481.725" id=c_"1481.725">__U__</span> system. I did the, they had the oppor option for kind of a payment plan for it. You would, you would subscribe for a year and pay, I don't remember what it was, but not too terribly much a month by, by standards of synthesizer costs, costs. And, by the end of the year you had a very basic, like East coast voice, a couple oscillators, a filter, A-D-S-R-V-C-A, et cetera, a couple VCAs probably. And then I kind of started adding onto that and I was with that for a couple years before I was, then looking in, wire magazine and saw a photo of, of Robert Ike Aubrey Lowe with his Euro rack system. And I was like, how come my system's not portable like that <laugh>? So I kind of dove a little further into the internet and, that must've been 2010 or 2011. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b>By that time I'd been using the five U stuff for a couple years. And when I, and at that time the eurorack kind of explosion was really just beginning to heat up. Yeah. It already felt at that time it was already in full <laugh> effect. Right. But yeah, we hadn't really seen anything yet <laugh>, but so I basically just pieced, pieced out the five U system and started going into, into Eurorack because, once I discovered that dope, really it was, it was all dope <span style="color:red" data-ts="1571.745" data-end_ts="1571.965" title="1571.745" id=c_"1571.745">__for__</span> that, that really got me into some new concepts. I, I started reading all the manuals for things like sequential switches and logic and low <span style="color:red" data-ts="1581.445" data-end_ts="1581.685" title="1581.445" id=c_"1581.445">__pass__</span> gates, and these were all things I'd never encountered before that Mm-Hmm. And the idea of using these sort of like, kind of mathematical scientific concepts as basis for music was really eye-opening to me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It therefore then makes sense too that you're working for, you're working for make noise where things like the maths are sort of like the, the complete birthing of that concept into a module. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b>Definitely. So, and, it, it was probably a few months into my, my Euro kind of renaissance that I did get a mass. And that that definitely opened a lot of new paths for me as well. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right on. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b>At that time, I did not know that I lived in the same town that, that make noise <span style="color:red" data-ts="1623.525" data-end_ts="1623.725" title="1623.525" id=c_"1623.525">__was__</span>, are 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You kidding me? Are kidding. Yeah. <laugh>. That, that was just a fluke. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b>That was, that was just <span style="color:red" data-ts="1629.245" data-end_ts="1629.365" title="1629.245" id=c_"1629.245">__a__</span>, yeah. Basically unreal. Just serendipity. I, I was walking at a street fair downtown and, the MOG Foundation had kind of a tent or booth there. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> that it was inside of a building, but it was part of the street fair. And I was poking around at the Voyagers and stuff, and somebody there asked me if I'd ever used a synthesizer before, and I told 'em I had modular. And that was when they told me that later that day, Tony from Make Noise was coming in to show <span style="color:red" data-ts="1659.525" data-end_ts="1659.725" title="1659.525" id=c_"1659.525">__off__</span> a system. So that was when I met Tony just randomly at a street. Fair. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Unreal <laugh>. That's, that's a story 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's, that's amazing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b>It life-changing event. Definitely <laugh>. Yeah. Indeed. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So I wanna talk a little bit more about your releases. You have, when I go over to your band camp site, I see that you have 14 releases, which is pretty amazing. And anytime I see someone that's able to commit that much, that much noise to, to products, I, it makes me want to ask like 50 questions about their process. Right. Because to me it's like, I am always fascinated by how people approach the pro the, the concept of saying this work is done. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And so it's something that a lot of times when I ask really productive people about how they do get their work done, that's one of the things I really like delving into is, is how do you know when you're done? And I'm curious with, with your stuff, especially since it's so performative and since it's, there seems at least to be a lot of chaos involved, <laugh>, how do you know, how do you know when it's either done or when you hit the right one? You know? Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b>That's a good question. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>If it's a chaotic system, it's sort of like each time you run it, something different's gonna happen. How do you know when you hit the right one or the best one? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b>Typically, I do not do music with the idea that I'm gonna record it. So, so usually when I release something to SoundCloud or Bandcamp, it's, if it's SoundCloud, it's usually just something I recorded. I, I liked enough that I thought I should hit record on it, <laugh>. And then, and then I, did several takes picked one that I liked the best, decided that it was good enough for somebody to hear somewhere and just went ahead and uploaded it. Okay. With Bandcamp, I usually, I think of that as like a little more, I try to curate it a little more and only put up stuff that I'm proud enough of that I wouldn't just upload it the same night that I made it, but rather I thought about it a little more. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Usually what happens with that, especially in the last year or two, has been that I will make a recording of one of those patches that I was telling you about earlier where it's made for performance and I spent a really long time kind of building it Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And then I'll, and then I'll kind of like try to create the perfect performance of it and record it and release it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b>But in the case of the, the, the computer music piece that I released recently, I, I did a whole bunch of recordings of it over the course of like a year and a half. And, I don't know, it was getting, it was, it seemed to be getting more, enthusiastic responses from people I played it for than I'm used to. Mm-Hmm. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1836.245" data-end_ts="1836.285" title="1836.245" id=c_"1836.245">__<affirmative>__</span>, which people have always told me that. I mean, I've always got people who <span style="color:red" data-ts="1838.885" data-end_ts="1839.045" title="1838.885" id=c_"1838.885">__tell__</span> me that they like my stuff. And, and usually there are a few people who are really enthusiastic, but I don't know, I, I felt like it was a bigger project, so I spent more time getting that one prepared. Got it. And I ended up just sort of spending quite a bit of time kind of like deciding on the sequencing of the different parts and getting some album art from an artist who I liked and things like that. So, and I think that for that kind of thing in the future, I will continue to put a lot of time into it, but I also have, will always have like minor releases that are just random recordings of things that I really liked <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b>Sure. At the moment. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now can the, the title music <span style="color:red" data-ts="1878.755" data-end_ts="1879.045" title="1878.755" id=c_"1878.755">__four__</span> Zero Infinity Musicians, what does that have a particular meaning for you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b>I came to that over time. One of the ideas that that that kind of hits It's, first of all, it's, it's a little bit of an homage to Steve Reich 'cause he Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> wrote <span style="color:red" data-ts="1896.105" data-end_ts="1896.325" title="1896.105" id=c_"1896.105">__at__</span> at least a couple pieces that were music for some number of musicians. Right. Yeah. Some of the conceptual, basis of, of what I'm doing in that piece definitely has some roots and things that he did. The idea of, of a number of musicians playing the same motif just at different speeds is, is really like, it's the foundation of what that piece is. Although what Resch would typically do is to have everybody play it at a speed based on rules where they have no, where there's no, there's no breaking out of the rules and there's no individual 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b>Musician. Right. And what you hear as melodies and, and motifs and rhythmic things are, are all about the relations between the musicians. But there's no room for improvisation in any way. And I'm pretty sure he explicitly said that. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Whereas what I've done with, with my piece is that each of the musicians are, they're virtual, first of all. Each one is like a node on the, on the Manta. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But they all play the same notes in the same order, but it's globally, it is improvised. So it's, so it's an homage to Raj. And then the idea of Zero Point Infinity was, I had a couple, a couple, ideas for, for why I called it that one is, the idea that it's many, that it's kind of like many, many musicians at once since I had a whole bunch of different parts that were being played and juxtaposing with each other. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b>But also that it's really just one musician who's, who's actually doing the, the playing 'cause it's me who's playing it. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And then finally the idea that a zero point infinity kind of, I, I picture it on a graph as kind of an asymptote something That's right. Approaching one. Approaching one, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2008.845" data-end_ts="2009.005" title="2008.845" id=c_"2008.845">__yeah__</span>. But not quite there. Yeah. And that's both, that's both kind of just conceptually where I was at with the idea of it, it being somewhere between one and many musicians, but also just the idea that sometimes music for electronic musicians might not be seen as music for musicians at all. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b>But that's, I don't know, that's, that's just kind of an offside <laugh> of it also. Oh, and there's one more thing, which is that the idea of music being for musicians rather than listeners is something I encounter. Sometimes it's really abstract electronic music. It'll be thrown out in, in reviews and things that, that this musician or that this music cannot be understood by people other than the one who is making it. Things like that <laugh>. And thus it's like music for musicians rather than being music for listeners. Right. And there's kind of in that way, like an anti into intellectualism almost. Yeah. In the, in the music review world where Right. Where it's like the concept behind the music is not thought to be important. It's only what it sounds like. Yeah. And I, I am definitely not really into that Yeah. Idea. So, so it's kind of a, a minor tiny little, passive aggressive backlash against that as well. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, but you know, it's kind of funny. That's, that's actually really, that's a really good point because in other art forms it's really just the opposite. Any, any painting that's done just to look pretty is kind of considered trite, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b>You know? Yeah, that's a good point. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2106.625" data-end_ts="2106.845" title="2106.625" id=c_"2106.625">__If__</span>, if it's a pretty painting, that's fine. But what is the deeper meaning? What is the context for it? How does it in some way, you know, point to something deeper similar? Similarly with, you know, video art or experimental cinema. I mean, it doesn't even have to be experimental stuff. I mean, really straightforward sculpture and stuff. The assumption has to be, if it's just done to look pretty Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. That's, that's not being an artist, that's being like a product designer or something. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b>You know, it's interesting you say that. 'cause now I'm, I'm kind of thinking about this and thinking that people do really like a narrative around music, but usually it's something that's extra musical that they find to be interesting. Ah, yeah. Like, you know, the, the stories around like of the Fleetwood Mac album or things like that, <laugh>, like these, these are, these are stories that give people something to grab onto Yeah. While they're listening to it and understand it through. But if you're, but if your story is just about the musical concepts, then it's harder for people to grab onto. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well that's, it's kind of unfortunate, but 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b>Yeah. Not sure how to get around it really. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. I don't, I don't know that I'm, I'm sure about that either. But anyway, getting, getting back to the, to the releases thing I, in, in your process then, it sounds like all your preparation actually occurs as kind of a result of, you know, like a pending live performance and, and everything else just kind of happens as a result of that. Is that kind of true? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b>Yeah, it is. Definitely. I, I kind of hate doing like editing and mixed down and stuff. The things that take like 80% of the time to make recorded music. Right. But that are barely anything of what the creation of the music is. So I, almost everything I do musically is like trying to maximize my ability to improvise and play in the moment. I don't really care for, I don't even really do overdubs like 90% of the time because I just want it to exist in the moment that it's being created. And then if I like it enough to record it, then I will. But Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But I definitely don't focus on maximizing it as a product so much as just like, making it the best performance in that moment that I can. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well you seem to have intuited the direction I was going on this. 'cause I was wondering how much time you spent doing work that was like multi-track and then had to be mixed and produced in some way and all that stuff. It sounds like the answer to that is virtually not. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b>Yeah, it is the, for everything on my, I don't think I have anything on Bandcamp that's multi-track. I have some. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Do you just, do you just hate it? Does it just, something that you don't enjoy? Or is it more of a political statement? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b>Well, I don't know. It's not that I hate it and it's not really that I have anything against it. It's, it's, it's, I think part of it is, for me it's that, when it comes to doing like really intricate editing where like where each part is like very well thought out and especially if you're kind of like pointing towards genre signifiers and stuff, which, which is a lot of what mixing is, it's like mm-Hmm. <affirmative> deciding which part is gonna take up, is gonna kind of occupy which, which 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>One's gonna be the bridge 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b>And the mix. Right. <laugh> Yeah. You know, stuff like that. Which one's gonna be the bridge or, or even like, just which part is 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, which part comes forward now. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b>Yeah. Which part is gonna come forward? Like, it's thinking about like how this space is occupied in terms of how you're listening to it. You know, I've learned a lot about how people mix jazz versus rock versus, you know, hip hop or techno. They usually have a different, each one has its own relationship to the drums, the bass, the mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, the melody, the vocal. And there are a lot of people out there who can do these things at a very high, very slick level. And I don't think I can really compete with that. I'm really just a musician. So what I, I just kind of take a different approach. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, one of the other things that when I look at your list of work, practically all of it is Walker Ferrell and none of it is Walker Ferrell and someone else. I haven't really found any scenarios where you've worked with other people. Do you, do you ever do collaborative work or have you ever worked like in a group kind of scenario? Or is that something that you don't enjoy doing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b>No, it's, I, I do usually do my, my musical work alone and a lot of it is just due to time. 'cause I work, I work full-time and then, I'm also a parent and so I mostly do my, my musical work late at night and fill it into nooks and crannies and stuff like that. Right. And then if I'm gonna do a show, I find out about it long in advance. I al I couldn't do something I found out in the same night. I'm, I really don't have like, the regular available time to like work in a group over a long period of time. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. That said, I do have some, collaborators who I'm soon gonna be working with on some things. That's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2423.445" data-end_ts="2423.565" title="2423.445" id=c_"2423.445">__good__</span>. Yeah, I haven't played, I mean, I, I haven't ever really played modular or anything, like more like that live in a group setting. It's something that I really want to do though. But I, you know, I, I haven't, I played in a band way back when I was in college most like keyboards and stuff and I really enjoyed it. So yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'll tell you <span style="color:red" data-ts="2443.605" data-end_ts="2443.765" title="2443.605" id=c_"2443.605">__too__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b>Not at all against the idea <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Doing kind of collaborative or group work on synths is actually kind of interesting because it always takes a while to formulate because at first, you know, everybody can make all the noise and everybody does. Right? Mm-Hmm. And it's when you get to the point where everyone's like, I wanna listen to what that guy's playing. And people start focusing more on listening than on playing Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and all of a sudden really amazing kind of things can, can happen. But 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b>Yeah, definitely 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It takes a while for that to occur. Sometimes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b>You know, I should actually say that I did perform in a group setting. I just, I just overlooked this while, while you were asking me this, but, just a couple months ago I played in a group improv using, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2488.435" data-end_ts="2488.925" title="2488.435" id=c_"2488.435">__Seattle__</span> Lombard Instruments. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> where I played the, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2492.635" data-end_ts="2492.925" title="2492.635" id=c_"2492.635">__Crac__</span> and there was some, a bunch of other ones involved too. And it was a group improv, but with kind of a structure with two other guys. Okay. And we played at a house concert and that was great fun. And I'm hoping that we'll be doing that again soon. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It sounds like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2506.265" data-end_ts="2506.485" title="2506.265" id=c_"2506.265">__it__</span> sounds like that would have to be an amazing cater wall <span style="color:red" data-ts="2509.345" data-end_ts="2509.565" title="2509.345" id=c_"2509.345">__of__</span> getting a bunch of Lombard stuff all fly 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b>At once. Yeah. Yeah. Well it's, I think that, we're all pretty experienced musicians, so we and I have played a lot in groups in the past, so, so we had a good sense of like the ebb and flow and we weren't really fighting each other Right. At any point. I think, like what you were saying is like, that's sometimes a concern if you're playing with like, really, especially with modular type stuff live, it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2533.095" data-end_ts="2533.445" title="2533.095" id=c_"2533.095">__there__</span>. The, the temptation is it's very easy to have your own instrument just making sounds all the time. And it's really important to keep the dynamic movement of the, of the overall thing in mind. Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative>, given that I am curious, what, what are some of the future things that you're looking to do? Obviously some collaborations are in the work, but what are, what other things do you have in mind as like areas that you're gonna kind of expand your work? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b>When it comes to computer music, I, I've got a number of ideas for, for evolving the music for zero point Infinity Musicians concept. So you may have noticed that it was labeled as volume one on the, on the EP page, <laugh> and originally I just thought that was, 'cause it's just an arbitrary set of recordings of this improvised patch and I'll probably have more. Okay. But since then I've, I've kind of been developing the overall concept of it in kind of several directions. And one is, that I'm, I got a little burned out on having it control mostly multis <span style="color:red" data-ts="2605.045" data-end_ts="2605.405" title="2605.045" id=c_"2605.045">__sampled__</span> instruments. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="2607.685" data-end_ts="2607.805" title="2607.685" id=c_"2607.685">__a__</span> a big reason for that is that I'm really interested in just intonation right now. And for a while now I've been reading and kind of studying a lot of what Lamont Young and other people have done over the last 50 years with that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b>And those are concepts that I want to explore and that I think that my kind of platform for playing many instruments at a time will be really good for that once I've gotten it to where I'm, where I'm actually picking the tunings for the instruments I'm using and stuff like that. So, Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So that's something that I'm pretty excited about. And then I also have a couple ideas for incorporating visuals into it. I want, I want one of my releases to come in video form as well. So I'm working with, at this point a couple different artists on different ways to, to do that and have the visual structure be integrated into the control structure that creates the music as well. So I'm pretty excited about that as well. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That sounds, that sounds amazing. That sounds like fun. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Walker: </b>And then with modular, I'm just always continuing <laugh> tweaking. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2674.925" data-end_ts="2675.005" title="2674.925" id=c_"2674.925">__Yeah__</span>. Continuing to patch and 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's what, that's what modulars do, right? 
</p>
