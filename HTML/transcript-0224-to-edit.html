<b>Darwin: </b>This episode of Art, music and Technology is brought to you by Recording Magazine. According magazine is a great place to go if you're just getting started in recording or if you've got a long history of doing it, there's always good information. They are actually carrying a series from me called Studio 1 0 1, which is kind of a great way to learn more about the beginner mind part of recording. So hopefully you'll check it out. With that, I hope that you'll enjoy this interview with <span style="color:red" data-ts="37.705" data-end_ts="37.995" title="37.705" id=c_"37.705">__Gana__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="37.995" data-end_ts="38.435" title="37.995" id=c_"37.995">__Cashwell__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today I have the great pleasure of getting a chance to talk to somebody who I've met a number of times. He was actually part of a lot of the meetups that I was attending when I was living in the Denver area. His name is Gannon <span style="color:red" data-ts="57.055" data-end_ts="57.275" title="57.055" id=c_"57.055">__ua__</span>, and he has, quite a history in the audio world. We'll talk to him a little bit about his background, and you'll get to hear all the places that he's been. It's some pretty amazing stuff, but with that, rather than me acting about it, we'll talk to Gannon himself. Hey, Gannon, how's it going? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gannon Kashiwa: </b>Great, Darwin. Thanks. And, thanks for having me on your show. This is really fun. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Thank you for, for doing it too. This is kind of cool. Recording Magazine is kind of helping set up some of these recording <span style="color:red" data-ts="87.635" data-end_ts="88.035" title="87.635" id=c_"87.635">__focused__</span>, recording <span style="color:red" data-ts="89.715" data-end_ts="90.035" title="89.715" id=c_"89.715">__focused__</span> podcasts, and they, really wanted to have you be one of the participants. So, that works out really well. Why don't we start off by having you describe a little bit about what your current gig is? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gannon: </b>Alright. Well, my current gig is very fresh, very new. I started in February. I've been an employee at Universal Audio for the last five years. And, in February, I changed jobs from being Technical marketing guru, which was my actual job title on my business cards to senior product Manager. And so, as of today, I am, one of our handful of product designers and product managers at ua. And on my plate is hardware, specifically our digital hardware. So many, many people know about the Apollos and the satellites and, some of our other, PCIE cards and things like that. So that's my bailiwick. Now, I'm, I'm in the driver's seat and, working on some incredibly fun new products that, of course, I can't talk about. But I'm also developing, new features across the UAD platform for plugins and, for things that will run on today's Apollos. So it's a, it's a very forward looking job and, I'm really excited. I'm right now, I, I'm kind of drinking from the fire hose, if you will, learning how to, work in agile development and design products and get things through, through the pipeline. But man, I couldn't be happier. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that's fantastic. It's interesting, I just, for recording magazine, I was just involved in a, in a team effort to do a review on the, recent Arrow hardware, which was, really a nice, nice little piece of work. That was very cool stuff. What exactly is the product manager's job? I mean, are you, are you on the design side? Are you on the marketing side, or where, where exactly do you sit in sort of like the, the world of the corporate run through? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gannon: </b>Right. Great question. In product management at ua, we have a level of, a level of person that is called a product designer and a, we have sound designers. We have product designers that, that strictly work on, you know, what the design of a certain product is going to be. Then we have product managers of which I am, and I'm al I'm a designer, but I'm also, you would probably consider me a mini CEO of the projects that I'm on. So that means I have to pay attention to the cost, the opportunity costs, the physical costs. How, how much does it cost us to make something? How many engineers is it gonna take us to do something? What's the business case for it? I need to go out and do market research and do competitive analysis and see what other manufacturers are doing to solve problems, and then bring my experience to bear and say, how can UA solve problems in a unique way that that advantages us, in ways that other, other companies don't have? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gannon: </b>So, <span style="color:red" data-ts="283.365" data-end_ts="283.485" title="283.365" id=c_"283.365">__a__</span> senior product manager, since I'm, I have the name senior in front of me because I've done this, I did this 10 years before this at, AVID and digit design. That means I have a lot of responsibility making the right business case, making the right decisions for the products, and making sure that we're spending our research and development money in the smartest way we possibly can. And I follow the products all the way from, conception to the end of life. So in, in product management, in the classical term, I manage products from their birth to their death, and I'm responsible for their success in the marketplace. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That's, that's actually really interesting because I think that people don't really, don't really get that they, they understand that there's a, there's a huge amount of excitement around the, the beginning of the birth of a new product, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, absolutely. The fact of the matter is products are evolving right up until the day that they aren't available anymore. And, all of that requires a lot of, a lot of handholding. But it also means there's almost like two kinds of research that you have to do to stay on top of that before it goes out. You, you have what would be typically called like market research. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But once it's out there, doesn't that kind of also flip to something that might be maybe more appropriately called, like customer research, interacting with the customers, finding out how they're actually using it, finding out how it could improve now that it's in the field, stuff like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gannon: </b>Oh, absolutely. And, sustaining engineering and redevelopment of products is a huge part of being successful in this world. You know, you could, you can do the best you can do to get something out and think through all the scenarios and all the personas as they're called, who's gonna use this? How are they gonna use this? But until it's in people's hands, you really don't have an opportunity to see, you know, how well your calls were thought out. So that's a big part of it, and that's a, a, a great connection. And one of the things that, that led me to, this is five years of being the technical marketing guru, I sat on the front lines of, uas social media. So I was on forums, I was on Facebook, I was on Gear Sluts, and, you know, all the places that people go to do their, their personal market research. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gannon: </b>And I developed, a bit of a persona out there and made some really great relationships with power users, new users, various people in the market. And bringing that customer perspective and that information back to the product development side of things is, I think, one of the most critical things a company can do. Because when you sell someone a piece of equipment that's just the beginning of your relationship, you're, you are essentially married, and it's your job. It's my job to make sure that, that we get through the arguments that we get through the spats and, and <laugh>. You know what I'm saying? <span style="color:red" data-ts="467.935" data-end_ts="468.285" title="467.935" id=c_"467.935">__Right__</span>. It's to continue the analogy, but you've gotta, you, you have to listen to people and then respect what they have to say and, try to honor what they're asking. So it's a big part of it. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I think that actually, <laugh>, you mentioned gear slots, which is, I think that anybody who's spent any time out there probably is cringes a little bit, thinking about a job that requires you to spend time <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gannon: </b>Whoa, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>There, because I would assume that it could feel pretty brutal sometimes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gannon: </b>Very, very brutal. And just like any company, you know, you make mistakes and you people gain, they gang up on you because it only takes one or two influencers early in a thread, and all of a sudden you've created a, a monumental problem for everybody. Problems that they didn't even know they had. But just because, you know, one influencer mentions something, all of a sudden it becomes a really difficult issue for everyone. Right. So man managing that, the, especially in social, because there people are unidentifiable, everybody goes by a handle of some sort or an alias. So you don't know who people are. I from doing this and getting to know the, the, the audience out there, I am reasonably sure that a, a fair percentage of those people are trolls. In other words, people from other companies or people that have a vested interest in doing harm to us. And, you know, they, that's what, that's the name of the game these days. People don't know who you are. You don't know who they are. And so everything is fair game. It's, it's a crappy job. <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, I imagine. So now, in addition to doing the work with, with ua, you also still maintain kind of a, a fairly active, like engineering life. I know that at least you've done mastering for a number of my friends over the years. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, are you maintaining that still? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gannon: </b>I do. And to me, it's, it's critical. Especially now that I'm in product design, it's critical for me to have my hands on the gear every day and really live it, really push it and use it in a professional way. So I have a, a business on the side. I have a wonderful home studio called the tardis. I mix master, I do audio posts, I do sound design. And I, I, owned a studio in Denver for many, many years. And I still have clients from the old days, from 30 years ago that are still ringing my doorbell and asking me to do post work for 'em. So I have some stuff up there now for YouTube and Chipotle and Cannon, and Chobani, Adidas, just to name a few. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Wow. That's something. So one of the things I like doing in, in the podcast is talking to people about kind of their, their journey to become the person, the artist or the, the maker, the inventor, the imagineer that they are, <laugh> <laugh>. I'm a little curious about what your travels are, because you've already dropped a couple of good sized neutron bombs on us here, about working with Avid Digi about doing, about owning a studio, about some of this stuff. Why don't we, reel back and talk a little bit about the process of you coming up through the world of recording and, and how you got to where you are now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gannon: </b>Okay. Well, I'm old, so this is gonna take a while. <laugh> <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="680.025" data-end_ts="680.245" title="680.025" id=c_"680.025">__Ah__</span>, yeah, let's not talk about that anymore. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gannon: </b>All right. Okay. All <span style="color:red" data-ts="683.645" data-end_ts="683.725" title="683.645" id=c_"683.645">__right__</span>. Forget about that. But, I thought that I would be a musician from a very young age. I started playing the guitar and the ukulele when I was about five years old. I had, I grew up in a skiing family in upstate New York, and I broke my first leg of three when I was five. So I was laid up for a long time, and my older brother had a guitar, and I used to listen to him play it. I thought, I like that. So I started playing the guitar and, and, really just kind of hacking around at it. And then I, I grew up in a, a very small town in the Adirondack Mountains, and there were 22 people in my graduating class. Wow. So, yeah, it, so a very small high school. And, we did have a really good vocal and instrumental music program, and I was the fill-in guy because I kind of had musical aptitudes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gannon: </b>So I played everything from the flute to the trumpet, to the guitar, to the bass, to the drums, to the tuba, snare drum, the tenor, and all the different, whatever they needed in any of those bands I would play. Okay. So, I, and then in, in high school, I started gigging with the instrumental music teacher. So at 15 years old, I started knowing about the real book and going and playing tuk gigs at the fancy bars in around where I grew up. So that was <span style="color:red" data-ts="773.975" data-end_ts="774.325" title="773.975" id=c_"773.975">__kinda__</span> my interest in music. Got started early. Right about that time, I started taking classical guitar lessons at Syracuse University. My mom was kind enough to drive me the two hours each way. I learned from a maestro Spanish guitar, teacher there. And that really set the hook. So, my degree from college, I went to Middlebury College in Vermont, is in, classical guitar performance. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gannon: </b>And, but hidden behind that, in 1980, the, the director of the music program there named, George Todd was great friends with a man named John Appleton, who was the creator of, an instrument called the Sinclare. And, that was developed in White River Junction, Vermont, which is about 40, 40 miles away from Middlebury. So we had <span style="color:red" data-ts="828.385" data-end_ts="828.605" title="828.385" id=c_"828.385">__Vir__</span> number two when John Appleton would make his thing right. He would drive down the road and he and George would, you know, drink a bottle of scotch together and then whip out whatever was, you know, new in the Sinclare. So, you know, they had the first, the first sampler, we had the first FM synthesis. We had, you know, a 16 track sequencer, and all these things were just amazing to me. I couldn't believe the sound that was coming out of this amazing computer that took, you know, 15 minutes to boot. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gannon: </b>It was just cool. We also had a Moog 2,600, or an R 2,600 and a big Moog 9,000. So all of these synthesizers were kind of part of my, my classical experience. And I used to write background music tracks that I would then improvise classical guitar over, and I would put heaps of reverb on and do this atmospheric stuff that was, you know, really fun for a, a 17 and 18-year-old kid. Right. So, I took a year off during that time, and I went to the Berkeley School of Music, learned bass. And then that was my college career. I graduated in 1982. And right after that, I got married and my wife and I moved to Colorado. I played in bands here. I worked in a sporting <span style="color:red" data-ts="905.445" data-end_ts="905.565" title="905.445" id=c_"905.445">__good__</span> store, and we started our family. So for several years, I was a part-time, guitar bass player. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gannon: </b>I did tons of casuals, tons of lessons, and I taught at a music store. I worked in a music store. Did the whole thing that the, the Starving Musician wanted to do. Right. About, oh, this would've been in about 1985 or so, I started getting gigs at, a studio here in Denver called Community Creations. And, I was a session player, of which that's a dying <span style="color:red" data-ts="938.125" data-end_ts="938.365" title="938.125" id=c_"938.125">__breed__</span>. There aren't that many more of those anymore. Right. Especially in Denver. So I started playing bass on these, different jingle sessions in people's records, and they, the studio expanded into video, and a, an engineering chair opened up in one of their small rooms. So I worked for Free, that means no money. <span style="color:red" data-ts="958.105" data-end_ts="958.325" title="958.105" id=c_"958.105">__Wow__</span>. Yeah. Yep. I, <span style="color:red" data-ts="959.235" data-end_ts="959.525" title="959.235" id=c_"959.235">__yeah__</span>, I worked for Free for, oh, about a year. You know, I was playing gigs at night and then doing this thing during the day. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gannon: </b>And then finally they said, all right, <span style="color:red" data-ts="966.845" data-end_ts="967.085" title="966.845" id=c_"966.845">__well__</span>, you're worth it. We'll hire you <laugh>. So, I did that for a number of years. Let's see, that would've been 85 to about 89. And then in 1989, my dear friend and, and then future partner, Paul Va, and I opened up Rocky Mountain Recorders, which is a still going studio in Denver today. We were definitely, pioneers and groundbreakers. And that's when I discovered recording to, hard drive and using a computer and doing, doing digital recording, read about that time. That's when Pro Tools and, actually preceded by Sound Designer, came online. So I bought Pro Tools interfaces, the four four twos. First we started with Sound Designer, but when we finally got to Pro Tools, I had interfaces 14 and 15. Oh, wow. Of, yeah, the 4, 4 2 way back when. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gannon: </b>Right off the bat. I said, wow, this is way different from working on a 24 track and flying in sound effects using a two track machine. Right. And locking up to video with, you know, center <span style="color:red" data-ts="1031.965" data-end_ts="1032.245" title="1031.965" id=c_"1031.965">__track__</span> time code on a two track, which, you know, no one ever does anymore. Right. But I started using Pro Tools and almost instantly came upon, you know, some bugs that were really, really hard things to solve, things that had been overlooked. And, you know, we expanded our systems out to 16 Voices, which was unheard of, not only did it cost $40,000, but you know, there, there were, they were buggy. So I got in touch with a couple of guys at what was then called Digi <span style="color:red" data-ts="1061.245" data-end_ts="1061.605" title="1061.245" id=c_"1061.245">__Design__</span>, and I just called 'em on the phone and I said, Hey, I got a problem. Who can I talk to? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gannon: </b>So I started talking with one of the QA engineers originally, and then he immediately passed me on to one of the senior designers, who was, you know, mark Mike Rockwell, who's now VP of Dolby. Right about that time, they said, man, we need you to work with us. So I became a beta tester for those guys in 1991. And that was, right at Pro Tools 1.0. From that time, I, I worked on pretty much every Pro Tools released until about Pro Tools 10. Oh my God. And this is all while I was working, you know, doing my day <span style="color:red" data-ts="1102.785" data-end_ts="1103.005" title="1102.785" id=c_"1102.785">__gig__</span>, get Rocky Mountain Recorder. So I was very <laugh>, I was careful, but I used, you know, way, way pre-released stuff on customers, and I never lost, I will say it proudly. I never lost an <span style="color:red" data-ts="1117.365" data-end_ts="1117.485" title="1117.365" id=c_"1117.365">__a__</span>, a piece of data, never lost a session. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gannon: </b>'cause I would print it to Pro Tools and then immediately dump it to a 24 track. Right. You know, safety, safety net. Right. And so that went on for several years. We, we had a fantastic run there at Rocky, and in 1999, Digi said, you know what? We actually need you to come and work for us full-time. So I left Rocky Mount Recorders <span style="color:red" data-ts="1141.515" data-end_ts="1141.805" title="1141.515" id=c_"1141.515">__with__</span>, Paul was still running it, and I said, I'm gonna take a six month sabbatical. I was hired on as a hardware designer right off the bat, and I was working on a, a control surface called Pro Control. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, which was the, the first to, you know, motorized fader control surface. Right. So I worked on that and then worked on the Huey, and then six months went by and I, decided not to go back. And I finally sold my interest in Rocky to Paul in 2004. And I kept working, kept working at what became Avid then till about 2008. So just shy of 10 years. But through that time I did all of the control surfaces. So I started with Pro Control, and then I did the original Control 24. I worked on the, the 1 9 2 series of, interfaces and the Sync io. Right. I've then worked on the Command eight. I did the decontrol, the D command, the surround <span style="color:red" data-ts="1206.735" data-end_ts="1207.085" title="1206.735" id=c_"1206.735">__panel__</span> for the Decontrol. So <span style="color:red" data-ts="1209.345" data-end_ts="1209.565" title="1209.345" id=c_"1209.345">__it__</span>, that was, quite a run there. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>No kidding. Well, it's interesting too that you, I mean, so you literally started like in the Old Sound Tools days, right? With the very first 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gannon: </b>Yep. I actually, I had an emulator, so I needed an editor for my emulator. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright, got it. <laugh>. So my question then for you is, given that you started from kind of like Digi day one Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, what was the point that you were like, oh, okay, this is gonna take over? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gannon: </b>That would be probably around Pro Tools 4, 2, 4 3, something like that. So, 1994 ish, you know, it was, we got off to a rocky start. We had issues with hardware issues with sync, issues with software stability, and it was still quite a novelty. People were basically, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1262.185" data-end_ts="1262.405" title="1262.185" id=c_"1262.185">__it__</span>, it's, it's been an evolution. And people initially used Pro Tools as just a replacement for their tape deck. Right. So they'd lay a bunch of tracks down, and then they'd bring all those back out IO and then into a console and mix in the console. Right. And right about that time with, with Pro Tools four ish, you know, we had some new hardware that sounded pretty good. We were going 24 a bit. Stuff started to sound really good, and it became feasible. We started to get some more plugins. It started to become feasible to start to mix in the box, as people call it today. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gannon: </b>Right, right. And I saw, right then, I said, there is no way in heck I'm going back <laugh>, honestly, because you could not only edit, you could do arrangements. You could completely take something down and re recreate it very quickly and very easily. And it had instant recall, total recall. Not this SSL total recall, but total recall plugins, audio mixer, everything. And that reproducibility allowed you for the very first time to put a project away, go do something else for a while, come back to it, go away, put it away, you know, come back and, and so it, it, it was a mindset change that I think has been the, the biggest turning point or tipping point for, you know, coming into the digital domain. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, it's funny that, that you mentioned that too, because I think a lot of people, I mean, you see, you, you hear a lot of talk about people saying, oh, one of the real downsides of of digital is that you can obsess your way into oblivion. Right. And that is true. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I mean, you can, you can record 500 tracks of the vocalist and in, and in, you know, basically comp in syllables if you want. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But the one thing, and I, you know, I grew up through the recording world during that timeframe as well, and I think people forget the fact that what digital does do that you couldn't do is give you the chance to walk away. There was no way you could walk away from your analog studio and come back and, and even be close with all the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1398.445" data-end_ts="1398.725" title="1398.445" id=c_"1398.445">__effects__</span> settings. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Because even if you saved, even if you had automation, you could save that Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> that didn't do anything for you when it came to, when it came to all the effects processors and all the, all the line processors and all that stuff, and even for that matter, things like, level control and stuff, the whole thing, you ended up kind of like recreating an awful lot of stuff. And it was, you'd get close, but there was always this feeling like, oh, it was more magical before I shut things down. <laugh>, <laugh>, you know, you would build up this fantasy in your head that it was more, it was better before I hit the off switch. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gannon: </b>Yeah, that's so true. That's so true. And, you know, even <span style="color:red" data-ts="1438.465" data-end_ts="1438.685" title="1438.465" id=c_"1438.465">__the__</span>, the best automation systems back then gave you, you know, fader levels and mutes. But what about send levels? Right? What about pans? All that stuff. So, you know, you had these multiple hands on the console and everybody was looking at their, their check marks. Okay, where's my tick? Right. And I'm gonna go here. And it was very choreographed. It was a, it was a beautiful thing. I I really enjoyed that, that kind of mixing. But you're right, you could, it was, each one was a unique performance. Each mix was a unique performance. So yeah, the, the automation thing does allow you to become so microscopic. You know, we call it slow tools now because that's what it turns you into, right. Maybe. Yeah. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, given that you were focused on, on doing a lot of control surface design, it probably meant that not only did you bring in your experiences in the studio, but you had to spend a lot of time around other people's studios as well, right? Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gannon: </b><affirmative>. Yep. That's right. My tenure at Digi was probably one of the most exciting times of my life. I've, I traveled the world and I went to some of the best studios on the planet and talked to engineers about workflow. We had listening, parties. We had mixed demonstrations where people would say, I need to solve this problem. And so they would load up a tape or load up or whatever. And, you know, we would, we would talk about what issues and what problems we can possibly solve here. So that was a, it was a tremendous time. So, yeah, I, I feel very blessed to have set foot in some of the, the best studios in the world. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I remember working on the pro control and, and some of those things. And, and it was really clear that it was informed a lot from, some of the classic consoles. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> what were, at the time. What was it that you were looking at that represented the state of the art? I mean, was were you trying, did you feel like you were having to compete with SSLs at that point? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gannon: </b>Sure. SSL flying Faders, those were the two kind of predominant automation systems that were available at that time. So yeah, the total recall, as I mentioned earlier, you know, if you're looking at a screen and you had to physically reset the buttons and then <laugh>, and then toward the later e evolutions of that, they would at least give you the, the knobs would change color when you were aligned properly. Right. But, you know, those, that was one of 'em. And you looking at how we did it, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1590.825" data-end_ts="1591.045" title="1590.825" id=c_"1590.825">__how__</span>, how do you express groups in the digital world? That was one thing. How do you, you know, handle mute groups? How do you handle VCA groups, which we didn't do for a very long time. Yeah. Those were, those were the models. And because we were trying to bring in people from that world, it was, there was a very strong design guideline that we, we needed to make these things feel comfortable to analog engineers. So that was kind of, that was a big, driving force behind the design. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, it's, it's funny that, you were, you were so involved in the recording world in Denver. I actually was, I was doing recording stuff in the Dallas area, and, my partner in the recording studio actually got to know some people in the recording world over in Denver. And we actually ended up kind of like spending, spending time with folks out there. Denver was sort of like the regional center for that kind of near west. What kind of work were you seeing? The recording studio do. I mean, I, I have to admit that those kind of like the great days of big studios, I, I, there's still a time there that I, I romanticize in my, in my head because there was so much activity around studios, things were really hopping. Right. Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gannon: </b><affirmative>, you know, it well, both Paul and I, are musicians. So we went into Rocky Mountain Recorders with the, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1676.525" data-end_ts="1676.645" title="1676.525" id=c_"1676.525">__i__</span> that we wanted to make hip cool, luxurious studios. We wanted state-of-the-art. We wanted, you know, the best we could possibly afford to put together. We built it ourselves with our bare hands and, you know, a bunch of other really dedicated people that, you know, helped us launch that place. But the main focus of our work was commercial work, because, that's really, that was the, the heyday of when you could, you know, bring in a, an advertising agency and charge them a package price for some music, for some audio post, and, you know, make, make a pretty handsome dollar there. Another piece of technology that sort of came along a few years after we opened was called the Land Patch. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gannon: </b>And some people know it by ISDN, but basically they're, you know, digital, high speed digital phone lines. And you put a really expensive box on one end in a sending studio and a really expensive box in the receiving studio. And you basically have a 20 to 20 k, recording link in real time. Right. So, Denver being isolated and in the near West as it is, you know, we, we had a talent pool for people doing voiceovers and actors and things like that. But it wasn't la it wasn't New York. It wasn't, London. It wasn't, you know, any of the, the major centers. And so what the Land Patch did is, is bring those worlds closer to us. And that was, that was something that really set us apart from anybody else. 'cause we had, we had three of those boxes. And back then when you were doing a land patch session, all locked up to video with, with music playing in the background, all that, that, that was a $575 an hour, studio. Holy shit. Wow. Yeah. Right, right. And so that's, that's how you build a business, right? You can't build a business on 35 bucks an hour cutting drum tracks. So, you know, we still had, we did cut a lot of music and we used a lot of studio musicians. We played ourselves. We actually had a record label for a few years called Baby Jane Records. And that was really fun. And I <laugh> learned how not to do a record label. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gannon: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's the first, the first, the first rule of thumb of running a record label is learning how not to run one. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gannon: </b>Exactly. Yeah. I mean, we, we were trying to do the whole thing. 'cause we had, the theory was we had the studio, we had the chops, we could make records, and I bought a CD replicator. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, way back. This is again, in the, in the late nineties, you know, spent 15 grand on a CD replicator. And so we cut the stuff, we would farm out the artwork, we would replicate the CDs, print them, and sell 'em. And the artists would be, you know, satisfied. They would, they would start to see money long before the studio bill was paid. Right. So, you know what, try not to be evil about it, but you know, you just, it again, a tough lesson there is you can't make money doing it that way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gannon: </b>You can't even support yourself. <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, that's true. Well, it's funny because you talk about like doing commercial gigs and stuff like that. I remember, the studio we were in, we would do these like package gigs for like banks, you know? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you'd make like a generic bank advertisement set, and then it would be a package that would be sold. Right. All that kind of stuff doesn't really exist anymore, or at least not in that way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gannon: </b>Yeah. It really doesn't, the way things are produced now, agencies themselves have become edit houses, you know, so it's not uncommon for most agencies to have, you know, either a final Cut Pro system or a media composer system, and they're doing audio post up to a certain point. Yep. So they don't need to go out for a lot of things. So that model has shifted dramatically. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So you worked at Digi until 2008. Why, why did you end up leaving Digi? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gannon: </b>I burned out, you know, this is one of the things that was difficult for me. I have lived in Denver my whole life, or, you know, my whole adult life. And I commuted to San Francisco for, for those 10 years. So I spent a lot of time on the road, a lot of time away from my family. You know, I have three boys and I missed a lot of their, growing up. And, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1934.665" data-end_ts="1934.885" title="1934.665" id=c_"1934.665">__and__</span> that wasn't fun. And then the, the political atmosphere at the company really started to change, and it stopped being, as gratifying as as I wanted it to be. As you know, I think if I'm, if I'm doing all the sacrifice and, you know, really committing a huge part of my personal life, this better be fun. So it stopped being fun, and I left them, after, right after we shipped the, decontrol and the surround <span style="color:red" data-ts="1965.165" data-end_ts="1965.405" title="1965.165" id=c_"1965.165">__panel__</span> for Decontrol. And that would've been Pro Tools seven four. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. And what did you do after that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gannon: </b>After that, I went to work at the Denver <span style="color:red" data-ts="1972.985" data-end_ts="1973.205" title="1972.985" id=c_"1972.985">__for__</span> Museum of Nature and Science. That's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>When that happened. You know, it'ss funny because actually, in terms of like tracking your name. Yeah. I didn't really, I didn't really know of you related to Digi, but I I heard about you in relationship to the museum. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gannon: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1990.425" data-end_ts="1990.645" title="1990.425" id=c_"1990.425">__Ah__</span>, okay. Yep. Then, you know, I did that for one, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1994.225" data-end_ts="1994.445" title="1994.225" id=c_"1994.225">__it__</span>, it's less than a mile from my house, <laugh>. And also I, a good friend of mine was the vice president of technology there, and they were embarking on some really ambitious plans and needed some, significant help. This was, they were underway developing the, the health exhibit there, expedition Health, and they were redoing the Space Odyssey exhibition, redoing the, planetarium, upgrading the, IMAX theater to an IMAX 3D. So there were a lot of really deep infrastructural projects going on at the same time. Oh. And then we also worked on the, new expansion, the Mortgage Family Science Center. So I came in and I wrote the technology plan for Expedition Health and, finished that project, got it up off <span style="color:red" data-ts="2047.565" data-end_ts="2047.765" title="2047.565" id=c_"2047.565">__the__</span>, off the ground. There's about 60 computers that run that thing all in a network, all accu accumulating and contributing to a common database. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gannon: </b>And, it's a really fantastic, exhibit Plus it has a 5.1 surround theater. And I got to work on that and do the content for, for the theater and the performance stages. And basically, I, I brought automation and high definition audio and video, networked audio and video throughout the whole museum, and gave 'em a, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2079.685" data-end_ts="2079.805" title="2079.685" id=c_"2079.685">__a__</span>, hopefully a platform that will stand growth for about 50 years, is what the plan is. So we'll see if <span style="color:red" data-ts="2087.525" data-end_ts="2087.685" title="2087.525" id=c_"2087.525">__the__</span>, if it, let's see if A VBV is around in 50 years. Right. <laugh>. Right. Because that's what I stuck, that's what I stuck us into <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2096.275" data-end_ts="2096.565" title="2096.275" id=c_"2096.275">__Yeah__</span>. So, are you still involved with them? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gannon: </b>I am, I consult, I just actually got a call today. They're, upgrading the, expedition Health Theater. They're gonna change the, the movie that's in there. And, I got a call and they said, Hey, can you help us out, re-edit this and help us mix it? So I, I go over and help them tune spaces when there's new temporary exhibits going on in the upstairs gallery. Put in a big networked, system in there from audio. And if you guys are anybody listening that is doing installed sound, that's the bomb. The audio systems are fantastic. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You know, I think a lot of people who, who play around in the sound world, kind of look at, or they go to a museum and they see the kind of exhibits that are in a museum, and they imagine that that has to be a really fun, really exciting place to work. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2153.835" data-end_ts="2154.125" title="2153.835" id=c_"2153.835">__What__</span> was your experience that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gannon: </b>Oh, very much so. I, I really enjoyed the collaborative, part of the, of that, because there are educators, a lot of people don't know. And, and I think DMM <span style="color:red" data-ts="2167.125" data-end_ts="2167.245" title="2167.125" id=c_"2167.125">__and__</span> s is somewhat of a unique place because there is a huge visitor programs, department, and these are people that really concentrate on what's the experience gonna be. And then they work with educators. There's a large outreach division that goes to schools and really educates young minds in, in science and technology. Then there's the, the exhibits department. Those are the people that actually, you know, take care of the 110 dioramas and bring in the new temporary exhibits and stuff. So there are some tremendously talented and passionate people there. And, you know, to help them realize their vision and bring to the table, Hey, let's do this with surround sound, or let's do this with HD and we can really make the smoke and mirrors thing a lot more real than a slideshow or, you know, what it was before I got there. And so I, I really enjoyed that. It was, it was, quite a dream job. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and I also think that for a lot of people, working in that scenario is gonna probably give you the biggest potential audience that your work could ever experience, because it's not gonna be uncommon if you do something in a, in a high volume museum like that for your work to get in front of a million people. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gannon: </b>Exactly. One, 1.3 million anniversary visits. And that's, you know, they have the, they have more memberships than any museum in the country. It's the fourth largest museum in the fourth largest science museum in the country. I didn't realize that until I was there. Wow. By traffic. Yeah. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Mm-Hmm, <affirmative>. So in your work there, what is the oddest thing that you had to do? What's the weirdest thing that they asked you to do? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gannon: </b><laugh>. That's a tough question. What would be odd? I don't know, maybe putting sound in bathrooms. What do you, what's, what's <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You had to, you actually have to do sound design for bathrooms, or You mean the sound install? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gannon: </b>Sound install in the bathrooms, but I wanted to also do, you know, I wanted immersive experiences that, that, you know, took you in different places. So when we built the new Mortgage Family, edition, oh man, we put in, we did great sound, and I spent more money and raised more eyebrows at that than you can just shake a stick at <laugh>. So next time you go in, go into the, the Mortgage Family Edition and look at the big, micro <span style="color:red" data-ts="2315.495" data-end_ts="2315.845" title="2315.495" id=c_"2315.495">__tiles__</span> wall there. And then hopefully they'll have some sort of a music program. 'cause I put in a 10,000 watt, PA system that services that video wall. And, connected to that, because we had the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2328.765" data-end_ts="2328.925" title="2328.765" id=c_"2328.765">__biopsy__</span> system, you know, I could pipe ancillary sounds into the bathroom, <laugh>. So we did <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>For the truly immersive experience. That's hilarious. That's fantastic. So now you're, so you started working with UA and we already kind of talked about some of the stressors involved in, doing social media work with the company. I'm curious though, I mean, it's, the social media work wouldn't have been just, you know, putting out social media fires, but it also had to probably be also kind of an on <span style="color:red" data-ts="2363.205" data-end_ts="2363.405" title="2363.205" id=c_"2363.205">__the__</span> fly support guy, but also doing some of that customer research as part of that too, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gannon: </b>Yeah, exactly. And, you know, my, my gig being the, technical marketing guru was, you know, they made that job for me. I had friends, I have lots of friends there, and, they needed some help, but really that job was, I sort of spanned marketing and product management and engineering and customer service. So I sort of sat in between all of those and gathered information and passed it to the right places. So that interesting. It was more than just handling and gathering, you know, it was, I was fixing stuff too, so it was very cool thing. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What of the things that I find interesting about Universal Audio is that unlike a lot of sort of.com era audio companies, there are people from kind of throughout the ages of recording that are deeply embedded in that company. I mean, I, I know people from all, you know, that I've learned, that I've gotten to know over my career from all different aspects of the music and recording communities ended up finding, finding places in, in UA because they seemed to like focus on finding people with great depth of knowledge, right? Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gannon: </b>That's so true. And you know, bill Putnam is still the man, right? He is, he is still driving and he's passionate, he's involved in our new developments. He's involved with keeping the, keeping the wheels on the wagon. And you're right, he, he seeks people that, that have the fire. So it's kind of a self-selecting crew. It's amazing that it's not a publicly held company, right. It's still, you know, it still feels like a startup. Ideas can come from anywhere. So the meritocracy thing is still very real and very alive. And that's one of the things that attracts I think, people who are, perhaps a little less willing to just sort of toe the line. You wanna, you wanna be heard, you wanna be able to say anything that is, that you think is relevant and important and have it heard. And I think <span style="color:red" data-ts="2501.025" data-end_ts="2501.245" title="2501.025" id=c_"2501.025">__QA__</span> is, is really about that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I mean, in a way that's kind of like built into their DNA because if you kinda look at the origins of the company and the origins of some of that, some of that engineering, a lot of it kind of flew in the face of common, you know, the common recording beliefs of the time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gannon: </b>That's right. And, you know, when Bill started ua or relaunched it, his dad started the company, the analog side way back when in 1958. But when Bill and Jim relaunched it in 1999, actually Bill started doing this other company called kind of Loud a couple years before that. And I beta tested his stuff. So very, very much in the early, surround days before there were surround buses and pro tools. He hijacked, you know, a bunch of buses and let you mix in surround, gave you a little panner called Surround Pan Pro. So that's when I met him. I, I met him. God, that's 20 years ago, right? Wow. So when, when they relaunched ua, the notion was we can take this digital stuff and make it sound analog and really give it an analog, feel. And so, you know, Dave Burners came along and these guys made it up. So how do you model stuff? I don't know, but let's figure it out. And they did it. And the e even their earliest plugins, the, you know, the brand, the first LA two A, the first 1176 were head and shoulders above anything else that anybody else had had done. So that's really the kind of the seed that's still alive there and growing all of us. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So being a guy that's inside the building, I, I always like looking for people's favorites, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Mm-Hmm, <affirmative>. So you have access to everything. You have access to all the plugins you want and all the hardware you want. What is your dream setup? And especially among the plugins, what's the thing that shows up in every session? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gannon: </b>Preamp wise, let's start at the top of the channel. I love the six 10. I love the six 10 <span style="color:red" data-ts="2626.155" data-end_ts="2626.445" title="2626.155" id=c_"2626.155">__beat__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2626.685" data-end_ts="2626.805" title="2626.685" id=c_"2626.685">__I__</span> Me too 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gannon: </b><laugh>. It's just, it's so warm and gentle and sounds good on everything. And, you know, I, the, the older I get, I use less and less eq, less and less compression. I'm much more APTT to change the microphone choice. Gee, what about that? What, what about moving the microphone? I try to get it right from the top of the channel and that, I think the six 10 is amazing. We just released, another Mark two version of the Helios, type 69, which is also an incredible Mike Preamp and eq. I love the API Vision channel strip. I, I've always enjoyed API consoles and their, their, EQs are just fantastic. So those are, I, I like the top of the channel stuff there for reverbs. I think the most enchanting is by far the BX 20. I just, I love what it does, the lexicon, you can't go wrong with a lexicon. You can't go wrong with a EMT one 40. All those are great, but there's, when you want that vibe and you've got space and you're not playing too many notes, the BX 20 is, is definitely the one to go to. Let's see, what do I like in some of the other places? Dynamics? Oh gosh, there's so many. I, I really, I still go for the LA two A and the 1176 almost first. But 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Is that just because, is that because you're really familiar? I mean, I, I noticed for myself, I always jump to 1176 because I know from back in the hardware days, I know it so well that I can like, make settings without having to think too much. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gannon: </b>Sure. And it's the sound, you know, the, it, I'm used to the sound, right. You know, it, it does produce a certain sound. We've got, you know, probably the best model of the stressor now. So I find myself, you know, if I really want pop poppy drums, I'll go for the distress. You know, the Fairchild, that six 70 is an another amazingly vibey, piece. So I use that quite a bit. <laugh>, believe it or not, one of our oldest ones, is the LA three A. I still go for the LA three A. I love it. <laugh> interesting. So yeah, the older, older things are cool too. What else do I go for? The Shadow Hills definitely has a place in there. The mastering compressor is cool. The Summit audio, the TLA 100, that <span style="color:red" data-ts="2773.185" data-end_ts="2773.405" title="2773.185" id=c_"2773.185">__it__</span>, it's almost an LA three A, but it's, it's really cool. Try that on your record path. 'cause, you know, hit it with three to five DB a compression, it's invisible and it's, it's just very, it's a beautiful compressor. So. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And do you find yourself using different tooling for mastering than you do for recording? Or is it that those are your main tools for work, however, however it expresses itself? Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gannon: </b>That's a good question. I think I tend to go for, I wanna listen to the music that we're mastering first and then think about, you know, what's appropriate to it. Like, you know, if I listen to Mark Moser's stuff, I'm, I'm not gonna try to color that at all. Really what I, what I'm looking for <span style="color:red" data-ts="2817.985" data-end_ts="2818.205" title="2817.985" id=c_"2817.985">__in__</span> his stuff is just protecting the speakers and, seeing if I can get his level to be competitive and maybe widen it a little bit. But, you know, he brings such a great palette to it that there isn't a lot of, a lot of shaping that that needs to be done. So in his stuff, I'll use more, I'll use some of the cleaner things. Like I'll use the, the Oxford limiter, you know, I'll use the massive passive EQ or, you know, things like that. The Alicia stuff is super clean and, you know, although here, I'm gonna go back on what I just said. I use the EC EQP one a, one of the <laugh> oldest things we have because it's got that beautiful 30

<b>Darwin: </b>Hertz thing. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2861.005" data-end_ts="2861.125" title="2861.005" id=c_"2861.005">__It's__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2861.125" data-end_ts="2861.165" title="2861.125" id=c_"2861.125">__a__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2861.165" data-end_ts="2861.205" title="2861.165" id=c_"2861.165">__funny__</span> thing again, right? Yeah, yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gannon: </b>Yeah. Nothing makes it glow like that. Right. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. So Canon, unfortunately our time is already up in kind of then some, but before I let you go, it would be wrong of me for, to let you off the line without at least getting some sense of what you think the future looks like, right? Because you're, again, in kind of an interesting seat at the table. And so while I know you can't tell me about specific problems, what is your sense of the general direction of the, the technology of recording? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gannon: </b>Well, definitely our computer-based systems are here to stay. That's a, that's a given. I think, you know, UAS approach with DSP is unique in the industry, and I still feel very strongly that a real <span style="color:red" data-ts="2914.685" data-end_ts="2914.965" title="2914.685" id=c_"2914.685">__time__</span> system is, is gonna be with us for at least several years, maybe 10 years, even maybe longer, because of the fixed low free, the fixed low latency, the predictable real-time performance. So I think you're gonna see low latency interfaces from everybody else. You're gonna continue to see integrated interfaces with DSP from ua. I think we're, we are hitting some new levels of accuracy in how we model. And so I think you're gonna see more and more incredible emulations, we'll probably go back and do more, because we know so much more now than we did 15 years ago. And so I think we're gonna see more attention on the analog front end and try to recapture, people's imagination as they hear things. I think one of the things that we've sort of, the pendulum <span style="color:red" data-ts="2974.815" data-end_ts="2974.975" title="2974.815" id=c_"2974.815">__is__</span> swung far to the right when people just want a squeaky clean, antiseptic recording. I mean, how, how fun is that to listen to <laugh>? It's, it's not, and so I, I think there's a wonderful place for us to inspire people while they're recording to give them sounds in real time. So that's, that's where I think, at least our segment of the market is gonna go. We're gonna try to inspire people with sound.

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, Gann, I want to thank you again so much for taking the time <span style="color:red" data-ts="3003.535" data-end_ts="3003.735" title="3003.535" id=c_"3003.535">__to__</span> talking to us. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gannon: </b>My pleasure, sir. Thank you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And we'll talk again soon. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nobody: </b><i>Bye. </i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Many thanks to Gannon for having the discussion. It's really interesting to hear about kind of the early days of digital recording and especially the world of, digit design slash avids pro tools. You can imagine what a wild world <span style="color:red" data-ts="3034.085" data-end_ts="3034.365" title="3034.085" id=c_"3034.085">__that__</span> must <span style="color:red" data-ts="3034.685" data-end_ts="3034.885" title="3034.685" id=c_"3034.685">__have__</span> seem like, especially for a guy who was used to doing three code <laugh> or three track, recordings for sync and, synchronized 24 tracks. That was pretty heady stuff. Thank you all for listening. The numbers for the podcast have been great. It's been fantastic. I also want to thank everybody who has gone out and supported me on Bandcamp. It's darwin gross.bandcamp.com. I've had some really nice messages from people there, as well as some nice sales. It was really, interesting and fun and kind of heartwarming to have some people buy my music. It's a chance to hear some of what I've done. I I'm putting <span style="color:red" data-ts="3078.425" data-end_ts="3078.645" title="3078.425" id=c_"3078.425">__up__</span> some archival stuff there. If you could check it out, I'd appreciate it. Also, one other thing, we started streaming these out to YouTube and, YouTube has, some special opportunities for us if we get a number of subscribers. So if you have a chance, jump over to YouTube, find one of the podcasts, subscribe to our, subscribe to our feed, and that'll just help us out in the future. I really appreciate it. And with that, I'm gonna let you go. Have <span style="color:red" data-ts="3107.285" data-end_ts="3107.365" title="3107.285" id=c_"3107.285">__a__</span> great one, and I'll see you next week. Bye.
