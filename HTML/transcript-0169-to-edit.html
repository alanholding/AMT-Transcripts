<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today I have the great pleasure of getting a chance to talk to somebody whose work I've been following for a while. His name is Darren E Cowley and he is, like the Mastermind or one of the masterminds behind Isotonics Studios, who I've actually been using their work a lot lately because I've become a little bit obsessed with the Novation circuit. And they wrote the editor for the synth engine of that. But their work spans an awful long period of time in a lot of different technologies and ideas. And so now I've said my piece, and rather than me Yammer on some more, let's talk to, to Darren a little bit. Hey, Darren, how's it going? Wonderful. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darren E Cowley: </b>Good to see you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Hey, thank you so much to, for, taking the time outta your schedule to have this chat. This is really great. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darren: </b>Not a problem at all. It's, when you first suggested it, something I've been looking forward to and <span style="color:red" data-ts="65.875" data-end_ts="66.075" title="65.875" id=c_"65.875">__the__</span>, the rest of the team have been, quite excited about the opportunity of, hearing my voice for a change rather than me rabbiting on it, <span style="color:red" data-ts="74.035" data-end_ts="74.155" title="74.035" id=c_"74.035">__them__</span> through Messenger and, and the like, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Right. There you go. So, why don't we start off by having you explain, what you're doing, what you do with Isotonic, as well as, you know, sort of like the bigger picture of what your artistry looks like. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darren: </b>Cool. Well, isotonic really kind of started as just myself. It was, born out of, really mucking about with originally an ExOne 1D from Alan and Heath. It, it did so much, but actually promised more. So I, I spent days, weeks, months working with the Bones translator software to make page upon page of controls and that kind of thing. I <span style="color:red" data-ts="120.755" data-end_ts="120.955" title="120.755" id=c_"120.755">__had__</span> kind of moved on and then bought a <span style="color:red" data-ts="123.075" data-end_ts="123.275" title="123.075" id=c_"123.075">__called__</span> pad control and, I dunno if you remember, it was <span style="color:red" data-ts="127.475" data-end_ts="127.595" title="127.475" id=c_"127.475">__a__</span>, a little bit of utility software, which I think was called Farm <span style="color:red" data-ts="131.615" data-end_ts="131.835" title="131.615" id=c_"131.615">__Pad__</span> way back when, probably seven, eight years ago. And that was kind of my first experience of doing any form of proper coding, if you like. But eventually, max <span style="color:red" data-ts="144.955" data-end_ts="145.155" title="144.955" id=c_"144.955">__for__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="145.155" data-end_ts="145.315" title="145.155" id=c_"145.155">__live__</span> got released and I, I've never touched Max itself. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and coming from writing lines and lines of if statements and global parameters and stuff, having the visual environment was just enlightening for me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darren: </b>And, having just received an A PC 40, I say received, begged one of the retailers to sell me their demo version 'cause they're, we just couldn't get them in the uk I <span style="color:red" data-ts="172.315" data-end_ts="172.515" title="172.315" id=c_"172.315">__seem__</span> to walk into shops and Yeah. Yeah. We, we, we are getting a shipment, but it never materialized. So I, I set about working with Max <span style="color:red" data-ts="181.045" data-end_ts="181.205" title="181.045" id=c_"181.045">__for__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="181.205" data-end_ts="181.445" title="181.205" id=c_"181.205">__live__</span> and the <span style="color:red" data-ts="182.685" data-end_ts="182.805" title="182.685" id=c_"182.685">__A__</span> PC 40 and I think it's probably only about two or three months later, max <span style="color:red" data-ts="188.905" data-end_ts="189.125" title="188.905" id=c_"188.905">__for__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="189.125" data-end_ts="189.965" title="189.125" id=c_"189.125">__live.com__</span>, the repository of possibly thousands of max <span style="color:red" data-ts="194.125" data-end_ts="194.285" title="194.125" id=c_"194.125">__for__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="194.285" data-end_ts="194.405" title="194.285" id=c_"194.285">__live__</span> devices now. Right. That, that was born. And, I whacked up a device called Isotonic and it was named quite simply. I was sitting there in the evening doing my patching away and the first advice I did was, around trying to get some looping kind of behavior going, which was ultimately forgetful <laugh>, didn't, didn't work particularly well, but I took some inspiration. I was just staring at my old school hardcore Rave records and one of them was called Liquid. And so the first device was called Liquid. The second device, which was Isotonic, took its name from the Everywhere I go <span style="color:red" data-ts="239.935" data-end_ts="240.285" title="239.935" id=c_"239.935">__tuned__</span> by Isotonic, who is, seemingly a very nice guy who's ended up being one of my customers, some many years later. So that's, that's, that's really where it, where it started. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's hilarious. So these first, these first Maxi devices that you did, what, what kind of stuff did they do? I mean, I have a Dimm memory, but, I think I might have had a few beers between then and now. So it's, it's <laugh> <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darren: </b>I've had a few bottles of Red Wine as well. <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="267.895" data-end_ts="268.245" title="267.895" id=c_"267.895">__Great__</span>. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darren: </b>I think the thing was <span style="color:red" data-ts="270.835" data-end_ts="271.125" title="270.835" id=c_"270.835">__with__</span>, because Max <span style="color:red" data-ts="272.285" data-end_ts="272.485" title="272.285" id=c_"272.285">__for__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="272.485" data-end_ts="272.685" title="272.485" id=c_"272.485">__Live__</span> was the first in live kind of approved hackable way of doing things. Right. There was the IAPI projects before, right? But when Max <span style="color:red" data-ts="284.245" data-end_ts="284.445" title="284.245" id=c_"284.245">__for__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="284.445" data-end_ts="284.605" title="284.445" id=c_"284.445">__Live__</span> started sort of the devices I was seeing were delays and granulator and, you know, all sorts of audio effects. And it didn't really make much sense to me. 'cause I, I, I'm actually, I'm not a producer. I'm a dj. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, first and foremost, I, I, I like performing and able to appeal to me on the original basis that I <span style="color:red" data-ts="307.725" data-end_ts="307.845" title="307.725" id=c_"307.725">__can__</span> make mix tapes quite simply dragging into <span style="color:red" data-ts="311.035" data-end_ts="311.525" title="311.035" id=c_"311.035">__arrange__</span> mode and pretending that I could beat match perfectly every single time and mix 10 tracks, which my friend thought was quite amazing until I showed them exactly how I was doing it. So I didn't really want to go down the route of producing another flanger or anything like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darren: </b>But Maxwell <span style="color:red" data-ts="330.445" data-end_ts="330.605" title="330.445" id=c_"330.445">__Life__</span> actually allows you to get under the skin of Ableton. And so I wanted to create a kind of one controller mega <span style="color:red" data-ts="340.705" data-end_ts="340.925" title="340.705" id=c_"340.705">__set__</span> kind of thing. And, there's a guy called Tom Cosm, who you've probably heard of Yep. Who I'm delighted, has now joined the Isotonic Collective as part of the circuit artists that are putting <span style="color:red" data-ts="353.425" data-end_ts="353.645" title="353.425" id=c_"353.425">__out__</span> patches. He, he put together this me mega set principle where you just broke your whole tracks into individual clips. So you could put them in tracks and then basically phrase your mixing as you went without any real sort of, I'd call it proper preparation. 'cause you still had that element of grabbing a record out the box. You did have to walk your clips and split them beforehand. But I'd had them all set up in sort of eight tracks, five clips per tune effectively. And I wanted to do a little bit more with them. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darren: </b>So with Max <span style="color:red" data-ts="391.685" data-end_ts="391.965" title="391.685" id=c_"391.685">__Alive__</span>, I was able to dig into the control surface itself. And so whilst the APC 40 on one level, the, the first version of it was kind of trigger clips, change volumes, and affect the track that's in question. And the device that's in question. It didn't really work for me as a dj Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> because if I was on track one and I was playing with a bass and filtering it down, I'd wanna be doing a similar kind of thing on track two as well. So I basically designed the device to enable me to take over the encoders, which still are pretty much some of the best encoders out there with their visual feedback that you can switch between banks and see where you are. I still think there's a, there's a gap in the market for someone coming out with a, a, I'd say a reasonably priced version of just the, the encoders type thing. <span style="color:red" data-ts="448.745" data-end_ts="448.965" title="448.745" id=c_"448.745">__See__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Encoders, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darren: </b>Yeah. That, that would be really cool. But my idea was simply to get rid of the track control and the device control and actually arrange those encoders vertically. So I would have four in a row for four tracks base, mid tre and game, and then I could switch to another bank. I'd have high filter, low filter resonance, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="474.505" data-end_ts="474.725" title="474.505" id=c_"474.505">__pat__</span> a flanger and that kind of thing. And it, it was really digging deeper and deeper into what is still actually undocumented areas of, mats <span style="color:red" data-ts="485.005" data-end_ts="485.285" title="485.005" id=c_"485.005">__alive__</span> to find out how I could disconnect an encoder, take control of it, listen to what it moves, light it up, change the way it lights. It really was a kind of Sudoku puzzle, that my wife calls it my homework, it's my hobby. It's <span style="color:red" data-ts="502.645" data-end_ts="502.845" title="502.645" id=c_"502.645">__the__</span> <laugh>, you know, there's a puzzle. I've gotta fix it. I'll, I'll finish, I'll put the laptop down, we'll go in the front room. And then 20 minutes later, the idea of how to solve that thing I've been working on for the last two days will come to me and I'll, I'll excuse myself and she knows where I'm going. <laugh>, that's, she's <span style="color:red" data-ts="521.365" data-end_ts="521.565" title="521.365" id=c_"521.365">__very__</span>, very, very considerate on that <span style="color:red" data-ts="523.485" data-end_ts="523.725" title="523.485" id=c_"523.485">__basis__</span>. <laugh>. Well, that's, <span style="color:red" data-ts="524.545" data-end_ts="524.765" title="524.545" id=c_"524.545">__it__</span> might be insane if I'm sitting there and it's going around my head. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, especially when you're doing that problem solving, it's like you get that thing where you think, I think this is how it would solve it. And it's like going to eat at you until you find out if it worked or not. Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="540.425" data-end_ts="540.645" title="540.425" id=c_"540.425">__Oh__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darren: </b>It, and to be fair, max and Max <span style="color:red" data-ts="543.795" data-end_ts="544.085" title="543.795" id=c_"543.795">__life__</span> doesn't help. It really doesn't because there's, there's like 40 ways of doing the same thing. And I'll find a solution and I look at some of the stuff I released right at the start, and I look at it now and go, oh my God, that's, that's almost embarrassing <laugh> if anyone opened that up and had a look at it with, its like 375 send and receives of <span style="color:red" data-ts="566.645" data-end_ts="566.765" title="566.645" id=c_"566.645">__a__</span> one simple task. I, every day I am learning. And it's really helped me with the guys on the team digging in and reverse engineering their stuff. Yeah. And we run a, a Facebook group, so <span style="color:red" data-ts="580.125" data-end_ts="580.245" title="580.125" id=c_"580.125">__it__</span>, it's a private one, and if anyone gets stuck, they throw up a piece of code and people pull it apart, put it back together, and I <span style="color:red" data-ts="587.305" data-end_ts="587.525" title="587.305" id=c_"587.305">__nip__</span> the snippet and then use it my own stuff. It's quite useful. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's actually interesting though, that you talk about it in that way because, you know, given my position, I get to kind of go all over the world and talk to people at Max. And one of the things I would say is that most people are scared to show me their max patches. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darren: </b>Really? Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And the reason I think is because there's this assumption that there really probably is just one right way to do things. And I'm gonna look stupid if they see what I, what my patch looks like. Right. And I'm like, I'm like, no, that's the cool thing about Max is there's like 50 ways. Anything you want to do, there's 50 ways to do it. Right? Yeah. And whichever way you choose to do, if you get the job done, that's the winner. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darren: </b>Absolutely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But, I think that you actually cracked something that a lot of people don't, which is if you allow yourself to kinda like open your patches and share it or whatever, you'll get hints and you'll constantly be growing and you'll learn stuff at a rate that you never would by just kind of like trying to intellectually figure stuff out. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darren: </b>Absolutely. I mean, I, I pretty much have patched and probably will always patch on a trial and error basis. <laugh>, every now and again, the alt click on what does this object actually do and <laugh> Oh, I see. Right. Okay. But pulling stuff apart, and I, I tend to finish a patch. I'll send it to probably Lee, Huddleston, who, who's probably one of my closest, partners on the team. And he'll open it up and he'll go, right, okay, well you can delete about 20 objects in that path by doing this, this, and this. And every now and again, I'll just be staring at something for an hour. Right. And I'll send him a Messenger message on Messenger, and it will come back in an answer that's so in unbelievably simple. I'm, I'm looking for, an object that that doesn't exist, but the combination of two and, and wiring the patch cord backwards to the way I thought actually does what I'm looking for, and that, that's the beauty of it. In reality, it does allow you to do what you want. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You said that you're kind of a DJ at heart, but also you talked when you were playing around with doing things with the, with the core drum pad, that you were kind of a coder at that point. You came to vis the visual programming of Max kind of because of Max for Live. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darren: </b>Yeah. It, it, it really was literally, I, I DJ'ed for many, many years lugging around record boxes, six at a time. Before I had a car, I actually managed to get six on a bus at one point to get myself to a, to a gig, which was, enjoyable at the other end watching the bus driver just stare at me making him late. Yeah. Right. And then as time moved on and it, it got into C DJs, I got the first, mark thousands, which are still in a box somewhere in the house, <laugh>. And I was always looking for the next thing. And I, I must admit, going across the CDs, I kind of lost quite a bit of my love affair for, for DJing. Sure. <span style="color:red" data-ts="780.745" data-end_ts="780.965" title="780.745" id=c_"780.745">__It__</span> became very formulaic. You'd look at the countdown and it was one minute 45 press play, you know, you've got exact time to phrase it in, bring the next one in, mix out. And I just looking for something more. And when I packed the CDs away, and, I'd moved on at that point to Serato and back into vinyl and vinyl control, I was recording my mixes, and I'm sure you'll be appreciative of spending an hour and a half trying to get a mix perfect. And just at the point where you think, <span style="color:red" data-ts="814.885" data-end_ts="815.125" title="814.885" id=c_"814.885">__right__</span>, I'm done. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darren: </b>You slip. Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="818.665" data-end_ts="818.885" title="818.665" id=c_"818.665">__It__</span> goes <span style="color:red" data-ts="819.045" data-end_ts="819.245" title="819.045" id=c_"819.045">__outta__</span> time. And you're like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="820.305" data-end_ts="820.525" title="820.305" id=c_"820.305">__ah__</span>. So it, it was, it was always a challenge to get that perfect mix and, put it on a cd, put it into a promoter's hand and find your big break, which unfortunately never happened, but hey, things happen for a reason. So I think it was Ableton Life five, and actually bit of a confession myself and, a friend, by the name of Neil, we went halves on buying it Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and, split the unlocks between us. So he had it on his, I had it on mine. And, I set about creating perfect mixes in that way. It led me to start playing out with Ableton on that basis with various different MIDI controllers. The pad control, the ExOne 1D, which became two of them. Then it's the AP PC 40. Then there was a launch <span style="color:red" data-ts="874.255" data-end_ts="874.475" title="874.255" id=c_"874.255">__pad__</span>, and there was another launch pad. Then there was some coders. And I'm, I'm staring at like three of those packing boxes that are just filled with various <span style="color:red" data-ts="886.535" data-end_ts="886.755" title="886.535" id=c_"886.535">__mid__</span> controllers. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Controllers, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darren: </b>Yeah. That have buttons and lights and Yeah. My wife buys shoes. I <span style="color:red" data-ts="893.325" data-end_ts="893.525" title="893.325" id=c_"893.325">__buy__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. So, what is it about working, I mean, 'cause to a certain extent you could say that working inside of Ableton is sort of a different version of the thing you didn't like about CDs, which is, it kind of, it has the potential of making everything perfect, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darren: </b>It does, but it allows me to focus on other things. And I know the argument of sync or, or not sync. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I've been a DJ for 20 odd years, so I think I know how to be sync. Now, <laugh>, I, I don't need to prove it to anybody. Right. But if I've got a, a baseline of one tune mixed in with the drumbeat of another, I've got the synth and strings coming over another, and then I'm dropping an acapella that I've cut up, I can create something new. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and yeah, I appreciate if you are playing out to a big crowd, they want to hear tunes in the way that they were made. And I've not made my own things, but I, I really sort of go back to the age of cold cut and the like, and doing Cutups and stuff like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Doing live remixing basically. Right. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darren: </b>Basically that was it. And the whole, the whole appeal of Ableton was to be able to do that admittedly pre-prepared at the start, but then getting more and more spontaneous as time went on and Max <span style="color:red" data-ts="974.355" data-end_ts="974.645" title="974.355" id=c_"974.355">__Live__</span> really made that possible. 'cause I could access the stuff that I couldn't via <span style="color:red" data-ts="979.715" data-end_ts="980.005" title="979.715" id=c_"979.715">__bare__</span>, like via any media controller really to do looping on each track simultaneously. Right. Follow actions at clip ends, that kind of thing. Right. Yeah. It, it kind of opened up Ableton to another level when Maxville <span style="color:red" data-ts="994.405" data-end_ts="994.565" title="994.405" id=c_"994.405">__Live__</span> came out. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. So since you kind of were a coder before you were a max, were you a coder before you were a dj? Or were you a DJ before you were a coder? I mean, which was first the art or the technology?

<b>Darren: </b>Co coder is a, a very, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1013.285" data-end_ts="1013.405" title="1013.285" id=c_"1013.285">__I__</span>, I basically learned by trial and error writing, text code, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1016.805" data-end_ts="1017.085" title="1016.805" id=c_"1016.805">__dunno__</span>, CI dunno, anything else. It was very rudimentary, but it's definitely the DJ that came first. I see that that's the first love. That'll be the last love. I've just managed to persuade my wife that the decks are going back into the lounge and the proviso that we get a nice piece of furniture made to house them. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, nice. Good call. Yeah, good call. But, so since the art came first, since DJing came first, what is it that drew you into, into doing Code? What, what, what made you say, I'm gonna move away from doing the DJ work and focus on trying to figure out how to be in essence a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1062.285" data-end_ts="1062.725" title="1062.285" id=c_"1062.285">__technology__</span>? I mean, if you think of what is a coder? A coder is just really a technology hacker, right? Yeah. You're ha you're using their tools to hack their systems, right? <span style="color:red" data-ts="1071.625" data-end_ts="1071.845" title="1071.625" id=c_"1071.625">__Yes__</span>. What caused what caused you to make that jump? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darren: </b>I think having DJ for many years and slowly sort of fell out of love of traveling three or four hours to play a two hour set that none of your friends were there, get back in the car, that was your weekend. It, it, it slowly dwindled in its appeal. I was fortunate enough to play upstairs at, space and IBI for one of Carl Cox's nights and came off the Decks ambition achieved. I've played to probably 30 people in this bar, and they turned the sound down the minute I stepped on the deck. But it didn't really matter. I, I'd kind of reached the point where I'm like, I've achieved this. And I, I found that, I thought at the time with, the Maxwell live.com patch rising in downloads to the point at, at one point it was actually the most downloaded patch was like 10,000 downloads. Wow. I thought I could do something with this. Right. And actually a, a little payment came through on PayPal from a guy called Tens <span style="color:red" data-ts="1136.805" data-end_ts="1136.925" title="1136.805" id=c_"1136.805">__Snake__</span> who was using it in his live show. And I quickly Googled him, found him, and he ended up having one of the hits of that summer in a track called Coma <span style="color:red" data-ts="1145.685" data-end_ts="1145.845" title="1145.685" id=c_"1145.685">__Cat__</span>. So it gave me a little bit of a boost and belief in myself that this actually could be a decent direction for me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>On your site, you have a really extensive set of tools for people to get their hands on. How much of that stuff is, I mean, you have some stuff that's obviously not Max for live or even, I don't know if it's max <span style="color:red" data-ts="1166.845" data-end_ts="1167.085" title="1166.845" id=c_"1166.845">__based__</span>. You have stuff for like Beringer's is some of this, is some of this stuff just, basically the Python scripts to make 'em work inside of Ableton? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darren: </b>Yeah, very much so. Oh, okay. Alright. Yeah. I, I was fortunate enough to get hold of, one of the K <span style="color:red" data-ts="1183.365" data-end_ts="1183.685" title="1183.365" id=c_"1183.365">__series__</span>, the K two from Alan Heath. Oh. When Andy Rigby Jones was working there, he basically went, what can you do with this? And it was, it was quite a pig to work with. 'cause there was no Python script for it. So you were kind of trying to translate the midi and do stuff with it. And it, it wasn wasn't 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1201.965" data-end_ts="1202.005" title="1201.965" id=c_"1201.965">__Right__</span>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1202.005" data-end_ts="1202.205" title="1202.005" id=c_"1202.005">__Was__</span> doing the mid mapping, which is always a pain in the ass, right? Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darren: </b>Yeah. And you, you restricted, so, and the thing was, it was like a mini <span style="color:red" data-ts="1211.405" data-end_ts="1211.525" title="1211.405" id=c_"1211.405">__a__</span> PC 40 to me. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, there was a guy out there called, will Marshall, who'd made a Python <span style="color:red" data-ts="1217.525" data-end_ts="1217.725" title="1217.525" id=c_"1217.525">__and__</span> script for it, but it wasn't quite finished. And just happened to bump into Lee, Lee Huddleston through Facebook and various other forums and stuff, and asked him if he'd be willing to have a look at it. He pulled it apart, rewrote it from scratch. And that was our first kind of controller script, if you like. I see. That's really the start of, that relationship which has grown and grown and grown. I mean, we've done stuff as simple as just the a PC mini <span style="color:red" data-ts="1251.455" data-end_ts="1251.805" title="1251.455" id=c_"1251.455">__Excel__</span> adding session control to it. But then there's other stuff like the, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1256.385" data-end_ts="1256.605" title="1256.385" id=c_"1256.385">__aai__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1256.635" data-end_ts="1256.925" title="1256.635" id=c_"1256.635">__MIDI__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1256.925" data-end_ts="1257.085" title="1256.925" id=c_"1256.925">__mix__</span>, which is a great, really, really cheap controller, but doesn't do a great deal in Ableton. So we put a really supercharged script behind it. Then the, the bearing is stuff which it's a meaty, massive controller. If they could slim that down and make it really cheap and popular, it, it, that could be my dream. I've actually, I'm sitting, staring at two of them 'cause I, I bought one and I won one on eBay that I forgot. I bid on <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darren: </b>So that that's gotta be used in a video before I put it back on eBay. I think <span style="color:red" data-ts="1293.985" data-end_ts="1294.405" title="1293.985" id=c_"1293.985">__that's__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>One of the things that I have noticed though, and I noticed this first of all, because it was recently announced for the isotonic circuit editor. Novation for the editor for Novation, is you've started doing, VST and au ports of your stuff too, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darren: </b>Yeah, that's, I can't claim any credit for that bar giving Lee a hard time on it. <laugh>. Effectively the, the circuit editor, the original one was a joint project between ourselves and Novation. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, they'd created a Max Patch to originally create the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1333.245" data-end_ts="1333.565" title="1333.245" id=c_"1333.245">__synth__</span> presets for it. I think if you put it out on a piece of paper, it would've taken up about 30 screens in size. Right. So our job was to pull it down and actually make it work within Ableton, which as, you know, ableton's restricted to one MIDI <span style="color:red" data-ts="1348.965" data-end_ts="1349.205" title="1348.965" id=c_"1348.965">__channel__</span>, one MIDI <span style="color:red" data-ts="1350.285" data-end_ts="1350.605" title="1350.285" id=c_"1350.285">__channel__</span> per track. Right. And the circuit works on three. So if you wanted an editor, we were faced with three different tracks all affecting different things and different floating windows. And it was, yeah. It was gonna be a challenge. And Lee basically came up with a way of bypassing the, the midi track restriction, with his LMH external within there. Right. And with that, we, we developed a circuit editor, which to be fair was gonna be maybe a couple of weeks work, but when we sent back our first draft ovation, they saw what it could be, became more like three months work. Which, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The dreaded enhancement requests. Huh? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darren: </b>That that's the one <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh man. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darren: </b>And to be, to be honest, they were really good because the, the team that was there were coming at it all from all different angles. They had a great QA team, so what I would, let's slip previously, they would challenge back and it, it was literally down to that's a pixel too wide. That's, that's got the wrong capitalization. The, the attention to detail was a massive learning for us. Sure, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1423.125" data-end_ts="1423.565" title="1423.125" id=c_"1423.125">__Certainly__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darren: </b>For me, probably not so much for Lee as he would, we say I don't test thoroughly enough as it is <laugh>. We, we wanted to, to do more. And so we then launched the Circuit Editor Pro, which again, was based in Max, has a standalone but a max for live variety. And the point of having the Max Maxwell Live variety was to get round ableton's limitation of 128 parameters. So Oh, sure. Okay. With the pro, you can, I think there's about 305 parameters from memory. You can automate all of those and actually use the circuit itself as its own, its own sort of standalone synth. Right. So you're not tied to the sequencer. So you can play clicks into it, get the mythical triplets that the unit won't allow you to <laugh> to do with the sequencer. Right. I don't see that's an issue, to be perfectly honest, but every single time, and there's a really active, circuit Facebook group if you've seen that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I'm a member. I, and a actually that group is what sort of convinced me that I had to get go, I had to cross over the boundary. I had to give it a swing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darren: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1495.185" data-end_ts="1495.405" title="1495.185" id=c_"1495.185">__Oh__</span>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1495.405" data-end_ts="1495.645" title="1495.405" id=c_"1495.405">__They__</span>, it's the most rabid bunch of fans I I've seen in some time. And where kind of other synth groups get a bit narky with each other and one, one man upmanship, there's such a camaraderie in that group and they're constantly trying to come up with new ideas and new different ways of using the, the limited synth and it, it's pushing the boundaries. And we kind of fell into that myself and Lee and, and wanted to do more and more and more and to expand it to, to other people and more users. It was decided to go down the, the V-S-T-N-A-U route, which we'll have a standalone version as well. I think on Monday, if everything goes to plan, we're gonna continue to develop that because that probably has the widest base of users that's realistically where the, the future of that particular product would, would traverse into. Sure. It also gives us the opportunity for copy protection, which is a, a challenge with Max as you can understand. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, I can. So the question is how do you make the transfer? I mean, I think there are a lot of my listeners that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1570.125" data-end_ts="1570.245" title="1570.125" id=c_"1570.125">__would__</span> be like, wow, I would love to make that transfer from a max driven development to something that is VST based or even, you know, true standalone based. Did you use the Max Patch then just as a sort of like, prototype for what the VST and the standalones did? Or did you find some bridging technology you could develop? How did she handle that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darren: </b>I can't talk about the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1599.805" data-end_ts="1600.045" title="1599.805" id=c_"1599.805">__actual__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1600.325" data-end_ts="1600.725" title="1600.325" id=c_"1600.325">__PST__</span> <laugh>. That's, that's Lee entirely. Okay. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1603.405" data-end_ts="1603.525" title="1603.405" id=c_"1603.405">__Alright__</span>. He's done that induced effectively, but Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darren: </b>You, you're describing it as a prototype is exactly where both ourselves and Novation came from. Got it. We originally had a look at do we do, do we do the knobs so that they look like the circuit? Do we replace the graphics? So it's kind of skimmed and VST looking. And we actually went, no, let, let's make it in max <span style="color:red" data-ts="1628.665" data-end_ts="1628.885" title="1628.665" id=c_"1628.665">__for__</span> live and use Max <span style="color:red" data-ts="1630.345" data-end_ts="1630.565" title="1630.345" id=c_"1630.345">__for__</span> live objects. And with that encouraged people to give us feedback and we <span style="color:red" data-ts="1636.225" data-end_ts="1636.445" title="1636.225" id=c_"1636.225">__set__</span> a feedback form and collated all the feedback. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1639.425" data-end_ts="1639.645" title="1639.425" id=c_"1639.425">__We__</span> sharing that backwards and forwards with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1641.605" data-end_ts="1641.885" title="1641.605" id=c_"1641.605">__Novation__</span>. I think it's, fair to say that even we didn't know what innovation's, full plans for that synth were. We, we knew they had a team working on the next step. And then when we saw it and then saw the next one and the next one we're up to 1.4. I don't <span style="color:red" data-ts="1661.685" data-end_ts="1661.765" title="1661.685" id=c_"1661.685">__know__</span> if there's any further development, but hey, they, they've taken that so much further than what came in the original box and I can still get an acid line out of it in 20 seconds. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Yeah. But when I saw the initial box and what was in it, I was like, oh, that's cool, but not very interesting to me. And with each update it was like, oh, wow. Well, they chopped away about half of the things I would've had a problem with. And the next one was half again is better, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1691.005" data-end_ts="1691.165" title="1691.005" id=c_"1691.005">__and__</span> it's like, holy cow, this is, so finally that 1.4 release, it was like, I don't really have any reason to stop, you know, considering I have to give it a swing. Right. Yeah, absolutely. But it was really important to have access to your, to your editor too, which was really cool. Now, one of the other things I know about Isotonic is, is it's actually kind of a funny thing, but I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1713.415" data-end_ts="1713.765" title="1713.415" id=c_"1713.415">__wanna__</span> talk to <span style="color:red" data-ts="1714.325" data-end_ts="1714.405" title="1714.325" id=c_"1714.325">__him__</span> about it because it's an important issue. I think, quite a while ago, one of the sound designers whose work I liked to get whenever he came out with something was this guy who went by the moniker Ned Rush, right? Yeah. And, I really liked his sample work. It was just, it, it just kind of really tickled my, my ear in the right way. Right. And then all of a sudden he announces on Facebook, oh, great news, I'm <span style="color:red" data-ts="1742.645" data-end_ts="1742.885" title="1742.645" id=c_"1742.645">__gonna__</span> be joining the Isotonic team. And I was like, these bastards are getting everybody, you know, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But, how, first of all, what is it, what is it that helps, has you Desi decide when someone would be a good fit for your team? But even more importantly, oftentimes when we think about things like sound design or sound tool development or whatever, it tends to, in our mind, be kind of a solitary activity, right? Yeah. I've got like a crazy idea and I just have to find a way to make it, I mean, it's like art in a way. I just, you know, I am compelled to make this thing. How do you take that kind of perspective? And I, you know, I'm, I'm projecting, but I'm sure there was a lot of that in Ned, right? <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darren: </b>We call him Sharon. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh yeah. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darren: </b>He's got so many different personalities that Sharon seems to be one that that fits the best. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's hilarious. So how do you take diverse personalities and bring 'em together in a team that's got a direction and a focus? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darren: </b>It's, I, I was finding, I I would be and you Exactly. So spot on with the, the, the solitariness of the, the sound designer, the coder, the staring at the screen for probably three, three to four months to produce anything that you'd share. And I was finding it in the modern age, keeping up with social and everything else. So I was spending more time doing that and coding. And then when I did release something, it would be in someone's newsfeed for a millisecond before it fell down. And I, it's like, I'm doing all this <span style="color:red" data-ts="1849.325" data-end_ts="1849.485" title="1849.325" id=c_"1849.325">__but__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1849.485" data-end_ts="1849.725" title="1849.485" id=c_"1849.485">__pulling__</span> effort in. And I, I think it's really brilliant and it's over in a flash. And I saw Ned was doing a similar type of stuff, but in a slightly different direction. His, was more of the audio plugins and the like. Right. I befriended him on Facebook as with pretty much the entire team. And we just, we gelled to be fair. And he had similar challenges to me. He couldn't keep up an up an output. So if we combined what I did with what he did, he'd released something one month. I'd <span style="color:red" data-ts="1885.005" data-end_ts="1885.085" title="1885.005" id=c_"1885.005">__released__</span> something the month after and then there'll be a barren month. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darren: </b>And that's where the idea came from of inviting people to join in, to be fair. And it's very much on a collective basis. Each of the guys is on a a month contract. Effectively. If you've seen, the, 24 hour party people, the story of factory records, et cetera, it's a collective. We all contribute towards it. And, we shout up our ideas on the Facebook group. So if someone comes up with an idea first, that's it. It's bagsy. No one else can do it, <laugh>. But what has happened is people have started to combine and collaborate together. And certainly the, the stuff that, that Ned did, 'cause he, he kind of reached a point with the audio stuff that he'd run out of ideas. So he wanted to do something completely different and came up with the brainwash visualizer, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darren: </b>Did a couple of others. And then we kind of went, wouldn't it be great if you could merge all of these together? He was working at the time with, Bob, the guy behind Visible as his kind of mentor on those visual devices. So brought him along and we came up with this idea of the world collection with one viewer and multiple modules. And from then it's, it's, that's been a massive ride of learning. And we've basically got a guy called Chris Vic, other end of the, the planet to me. So I speak to him in the morning before I go to work, <laugh>. And, we've got, Adam <inaudible> from the Tami guys. He's done some stuff for us as well. And we've just released a new pack from <span style="color:red" data-ts="1991.555" data-end_ts="1991.845" title="1991.555" id=c_"1991.555">__Send__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1991.845" data-end_ts="1992.125" title="1991.845" id=c_"1991.845">__Similar__</span> as well, another guy that's really active in the jitter world. And, he's been working with us probably for four months or so. Okay. And we host everything on a git like most development teams, albeit ones that are spread around the world, we build modules. It's, it's the point now where I who do nothing with visuals can pick up the little snippets and modules and patch 'em together like Lego. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's cool. It's, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darren: </b>Yeah, it's, it, it's great fun and it's really challenging working with all of these different guys and different experience, different personalities. They're all artists. And that, that's one of the great things of working in a team like this. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So you mentioned those guys and you've mentioned, Lee. Who else is, who else is part of the Isotonic team? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darren: </b>Well, we've got the Audio Outlaw, which is Antonio Sage, one of the Ableton certified trainers, I believe out in la. But he'll tell me off if that's not, not correct. He's, he's kind of the same mindset as me. He's a great ideas man, a designer and he works with various programmers to bring his ideas to life. Okay. There's a guy called Ernesto, who's the gentleman behind Strange Lines. He's just taken a break at the moment 'cause he's doing his education and thesis and that kind of stuff. But he's released three or four, three or four devices and he's got a ton of more up his sleeve as well in the MIDI worlds. Mark Towers is absolutely smashing it out for us at the moment with his arcade series, which really works around the principle that me, him, most of us as our youth, we're putting 10 <span style="color:red" data-ts="2095.765" data-end_ts="2095.885" title="2095.765" id=c_"2095.765">__p__</span> pieces into arcade games. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darren: </b>Yep. <laugh>, and now we are in music. So to combine the two, asteroids and Poly <span style="color:red" data-ts="2106.065" data-end_ts="2106.285" title="2106.065" id=c_"2106.065">__Pin__</span> based on pinball. Tetric based on Tetric. Right. He's just, he's just working on his, arcade series returns. It's not AADE series two, it's arcade series returns, and that's another great pack of narrative sequences for melodies and drums and all based round roughly an eight by eight grid. So they work with integration with the push, with the launch pads, and now with the, the Machiner Jam because we've been working with Native Instruments, with regards to their scripts <span style="color:red" data-ts="2137.445" data-end_ts="2137.525" title="2137.445" id=c_"2137.445">__in__</span> Napleton, and they've been awesome as well. Yeah. It's great working with manufacturers, especially when they listen. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well that was my next question because in addition to collaboration within your team, you have <span style="color:red" data-ts="2150.655" data-end_ts="2151.005" title="2150.655" id=c_"2150.655">__start__</span>, you have actually been doing some significant collaborations with manufacturers Now. Do you find that they come to you because you've got experience in the genre, or do you contact them when you see an interesting piece of hardware? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darren: </b>Originally I contacted Novation, with a device called Octa <span style="color:red" data-ts="2169.605" data-end_ts="2169.805" title="2169.605" id=c_"2169.605">__Pad__</span> that gave eight layers of control to the launch pad. There was a guy there called Simon Holsted, and he said, oh, that looks great. Where'd you live? And I live an hour down the road, from <span style="color:red" data-ts="2181.925" data-end_ts="2182.125" title="2181.925" id=c_"2181.925">__them__</span>. So popped in, we hit it off and I think a month later they gave me a Twitch, the dj Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2189.785" data-end_ts="2190.005" title="2189.785" id=c_"2189.785">__And__</span> stroller, oh. Create something in Max <span style="color:red" data-ts="2192.565" data-end_ts="2192.885" title="2192.565" id=c_"2192.565">__Alive__</span> for it, and I'm just about to, and they did it in house. And I was like, oh, oh, nevermind. Simon moved on and he went to Ableton and it's a very small industry as you can imagine, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. It's, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darren: </b>And his replacement then invited me over to <span style="color:red" data-ts="2209.395" data-end_ts="2209.685" title="2209.395" id=c_"2209.395">__High__</span> Wick <span style="color:red" data-ts="2209.885" data-end_ts="2210.045" title="2209.885" id=c_"2209.885">__and__</span> again, and, showed me the first launch Control xl. And I was like, oh, that's really cool, right? We want a sequencer. Oh, okay. Yeah. Brilliant. So set about designing that, pulling that together, and that's where the circuit work came from as well. We were actually working with one of the largest synth manufacturers in the world, but I can't say who. And they did just email us and say, hi, we are, and we would like to talk. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, which was Yeah. Fantastic to get that kind of feedback. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it seems like for a lot of people that innovation editor did kind of put you on the map because while the stuff for like true believers, I think a lot of us knew your work leading into that. I don't know that anybody expected the circuit to kind of catch a wave like it has. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darren: </b>Yeah. You 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Know, it's, it's, it's not, you know, it's not the most popular thing, but it's caught a lot more attention I think people expected. And a lot of that is due to Novation sticking with it and continuing to make it better. But a lot of it too was you putting some of this editing functionality into people's hands. That was, that was a pretty big deal. And so that was the first opportunity for you to really get in the face of sort of like the broader music community, I think. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darren: </b>Yeah, I think, up until that point, I mean, I sending out press releases left, right and Center, I've been very fortunate to get some features on <span style="color:red" data-ts="2302.145" data-end_ts="2302.565" title="2302.145" id=c_"2302.145">__Create__</span> Digital Music and Ask Audio and the like. But when the circuit editor dropped and there was a feature in Music Tech magazine, actual printed hard copy, and I'm standing in WH Smith and going, oh my, wow, <laugh>, that's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Amazing. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darren: </b>And then <span style="color:red" data-ts="2320.065" data-end_ts="2320.285" title="2320.065" id=c_"2320.065">__Syn__</span> Topia and Sound on sound, and it, it, it exploded. It really did. We, we have roughly sort <span style="color:red" data-ts="2327.285" data-end_ts="2327.325" title="2327.285" id=c_"2327.285">__of__</span> 20,000 people on the mailing list, but nearly half of those are because of the circuit editor. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Wow. That's wild. So you talk a little bit about having to be out there being active and kind of marketing yourself through social media. Mm-Hmm. One of the things that I'd say is, you know, because of what I do and because of the things I'm interested in, I get to see the broad base of people. And there are some companies that are almost obnoxious with the amount of marketing, right. And there are other companies that market so seldom that when they, when they do put a marketing piece out, I'm go, I'm like, oh man, I forgot all about them. And then I immediately forget all about 'em again. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darren: </b><laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You seem to have kind of hit the, I think hit the right stride in that I kind of see your stuff fairly often, and I think some of it is because you're generating stuff relatively, you know, you're, you often will have a new thing coming out, right? Yeah. So, so I get a chance to see it and I recognize it, I recognize the name, everything's there, but I never feel like pummeled by your marketing <laugh>. How, what is your perspective on doing that in a way that's like respectful of the viewer while still feeling like you're actively getting your message out there? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darren: </b>The day job has nothing to do with music as you could probably imagine. I work in the car industry and Okay, actually that, that's kind of a, a thing I took from there. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2424.545" data-end_ts="2424.765" title="2424.545" id=c_"2424.545">__We__</span>, in an industry that needs to hit a certain volume and units, the temptation is to have a sale every weekend, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darren: </b>So if you tell a customer that you've got a sale this weekend and they don't come, and then you tell 'em next weekend you have a sale, you can guess what you, you lose your credibility pretty quickly. Right? When we, when we started, when I started, I was quite often sort of every two months slashing the prices, doing a 50% sale, sticking it on Facebook, et cetera, and it, it didn't really have the impact I was looking for. And actually, if the products we sell are worth the price that we charge, then they should stick at that price. We, we do have a Black Friday sale, but we tend to be consistent. And with the marketing, I really kind of threw it out to the team and said, look, each of us is putting a month, two months, three months or so into a device, into a product. If I release it and then put another one out in 24 hours and another one after it, nothing's got a chance to breathe. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darren: </b>And like you say, you see something and you remember it for 24 hours, then you forget it. What we find is when we release something new, we'll also see people come back for stuff that they forgot about two weeks ago, which is obviously a, a great benefit to being part of a, a larger collective, but we try not to send anything out unless we have something to say. That was the simple kind of approach. We will break our <span style="color:red" data-ts="2518.385" data-end_ts="2518.605" title="2518.385" id=c_"2518.385">__new__</span> stories into videos and have those staggered over a period of time on social media because of the transient nature of it. But actually the mailing list and, and people's email, et cetera, is probably the most valuable commodity that we have. And we respect people not getting stuff every 24 hours. I still stay on mailing lists <span style="color:red" data-ts="2538.525" data-end_ts="2538.765" title="2538.525" id=c_"2538.525">__that__</span> I detest <laugh>, but I do it because I, I like to see what they do. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darren: </b>You, you learn from every email that comes through. Sure. I believe, anyway, it's, we are never gonna be taking out adverts in the tv. I don't see us as taking out static adverts in the magazines in any shape or form, but we'll certainly do pay <span style="color:red" data-ts="2560.805" data-end_ts="2560.925" title="2560.805" id=c_"2560.805">__per__</span> click in the future and that kind of thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I know for myself in having released product over the years, there are some of them that were good sellers that I didn't even, that kind of surprised me and I didn't even care for 'em as devices, but people, people liked them, so boom. Yeah. Great. All of a sudden I love them too. Right. Yeah, <laugh>. But, you know, I had some favorite things, both in, when I was doing plugins as well as Max for live devices. I have a couple of favorites. I'm curious for someone who's had their hands into so many different things, what's your favorite, what's like your kind of proud moment, your proud Papa moment? <span style="color:red" data-ts="2599.985" data-end_ts="2600.205" title="2599.985" id=c_"2599.985">__Oh__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darren: </b>Challenging. There's one from the guys and that's the multi <span style="color:red" data-ts="2606.075" data-end_ts="2606.365" title="2606.075" id=c_"2606.075">__clip__</span> editor that allows you to select various midi clips, whether they're in session or actually across, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2613.765" data-end_ts="2613.925" title="2613.765" id=c_"2613.765">__in__</span> a range view of Ableton and edit the MIDI notes. And that's grown and grown to have modulators of, it's, it's immense that, that one caught me by surprise because the first device from Sebastian was actually around creating light shows on the launchpad, which I thought was gonna be the most amazing device <laugh>. And it does work brilliantly. It just didn't have the appeal that I thought it would have. Whereas the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2640.595" data-end_ts="2640.885" title="2640.595" id=c_"2640.595">__mini__</span> multi <span style="color:red" data-ts="2641.285" data-end_ts="2641.565" title="2641.285" id=c_"2641.285">__clip__</span> editor, that that's blown me away. In reality, if it was one of my own devices, then probably Follow, which is part of the modular series, which very simply triggers a follow action to play a different clip and you choose which one at the end of the current clip, it can also trigger a scene. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darren: </b>And that's the bit that I really underestimated the appeal, when a guy called Christian Ponsford, did a video of it, using it effectively in worship and having it as backing tracks. And I know a number of people that use that in backing tracks on their stage. People like Public Image Limited, I know use that. There's a fair few others as well that have contacted me over time that have said, thanks for this. It's great. If we have a guy that's not in, we've got his track, it plays, if we get to a point we want <span style="color:red" data-ts="2698.925" data-end_ts="2699.005" title="2698.925" id=c_"2698.925">__to__</span> extend, we just hit loop, then our backing track continues looping. So yeah, that, that's the one that's probably had the, the longest appeal for me. So one of the first as well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I have to admit that that multi <span style="color:red" data-ts="2710.315" data-end_ts="2710.605" title="2710.315" id=c_"2710.315">__clip__</span> thing that makes my head hurt the complexity that must have gone into making that, that's an amazing piece of work. So then, kind of flipping the script, instead of talking about past stuff that you love, can you tell us, give us a little insights on what we're likely to see in the near future? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darren: </b>Oh, yes. There is, there's a new version of the Circuit Editor of VST that's, hopefully gonna be out by the time this podcast gets forecasted anyway, and we'll continue developing that. That is a complete new set of generative sequences from Mark Towers under the arcade series banner, including Pacman or or other ghosts. That's, that's a trademark obviously. Of course. The multi <span style="color:red" data-ts="2756.765" data-end_ts="2757.045" title="2756.765" id=c_"2756.765">__clip__</span> editor and MIDI modulators, will have a new arpeggiator that works on a completely different basis to other arpeggiator. That's quite exciting. Looking forward to more stuff with controllers. I've got a product called Opta <span style="color:red" data-ts="2775.125" data-end_ts="2775.325" title="2775.125" id=c_"2775.125">__Map__</span>, which will allow you to have eight pages of buttons pre-programmed, going back to kind of my controller <span style="color:red" data-ts="2782.645" data-end_ts="2782.885" title="2782.645" id=c_"2782.645">__wrist__</span> phase, the likes of Matt <span style="color:red" data-ts="2785.485" data-end_ts="2785.725" title="2785.485" id=c_"2785.485">__Mold__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2785.725" data-end_ts="2785.965" title="2785.725" id=c_"2785.725">__over__</span> et cetera, and pressing buttons and making them do 20,000 things at one time to audio. That's gonna be great. There's so much more to come from the world collection with the team that we've got assembled. And that plus the stuff from Lee, predator, which allows you to remap the auto <span style="color:red" data-ts="2806.395" data-end_ts="2806.885" title="2806.395" id=c_"2806.395">__mapping__</span> blue hand feature as you want it, name your banks and everything else with various controllers that's getting an upgrades and various other scripts. There's with a team this big, there's always something going on, but I never count it until it's in my hand that it's actually gonna be finished. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. I hear that. Darren, this was a fascinating conversation. It was really fun to kind of drill into, into your work and into your head a little bit. I really do appreciate it, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darren: </b>Man. Thank you. It's been fantastic. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright, and with that, I'm going to let you get along with the rest of your day. Thanks a lot and we'll talk again soon. Okay,

<p>
<b>Darren: </b>Thanks very much. Bye 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Bye.

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Hey all, thanks again for listening. Thanks to Darren for taking the time to talk. It was a really interesting chat, really cool stuff that his team is working on. Make sure that you check it out at the isotonic site. Other than that, I want to thank you again for listening. Thanks for a lot of the feedback we got from the tripod thing that was happening last month. I hope you all enjoyed <span style="color:red" data-ts="2879.545" data-end_ts="2879.765" title="2879.545" id=c_"2879.545">__the__</span> Sacks for live video that, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2882.145" data-end_ts="2882.365" title="2882.145" id=c_"2882.145">__it__</span> can put out.
