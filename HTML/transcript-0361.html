      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Okay today, I have the great pleasure of speaking to someone. Actually it was, brought to my attention from a PR person who tricked me. They got my attention by sending some photos of their studio, where I saw a tremendously cool set of
        gear. And, all y'all know that I can get entranced by gear once in a while. But as I did a little more digging, I, I found I really like <span style="color:red" data-ts="26.64" data-end_ts="26.7" title="26.64" id=c_"26.64">__the__</span>
        music that was made by this group. And, this PR person got me in touch with, sort of like the technologist of the team. His name is Luke Thornton The band name is elder island, and I am very glad to have you on the podcast. Hey Luke, how are
        you? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Luke Thornton: </b>
      Hey, I'm good, darling. Thank you. Thank you very much for having me. Yeah, I think
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Thanks a lot for joining. This is, this is really a cool opportunity. I appreciate it. Yeah, pleasure. So why don't we start off for people who might not be familiar with elder island? Why don't we have you just, give us a brief, kind of the
        brief elevator pitch of, of what the band does and what you do within the band? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Luke: </b>
      So yeah, we're three piece sort of electronic pop act live. I predominantly do the drums and bass guitar, and then we have Dave, who's also another technology head. He does the guitar and synthesizers and then Katie, our lead singer who, she
      sings and she also plays the cello. Our music live is predominantly based on loops. So we make the show as we go along and we rehearse it quite thoroughly. So we get our loops, right. And, we, we try to make it as free as possible. So we're not
      playing to a backing track, you know, for three people trying to make quite a lot of layers of music. It can be quite challenging, but we try and to make it as organic and as free as possible and without laptops, because we just find that, I
      guess in history of when we've tried it, it's a bit unreliable. And so we prefer, a more sturdier way of control. We have, analog gear.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>That's really interesting. Well, and I would say that, from even even the looks of your studio, your creation process is clearly not the, in the box pro tools, focused production scheme. Right. You have, you really take a different approach
        and, and one that re relies on sort of the fuzziness of actual electrons. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Luke: </b>
      Yeah, yeah, exactly. I mean, when you, when you throw in, a cello into this electronic world as well, we've always been like, oh, Christ, how do we, how do we, you know, mold it correctly? Yeah. Yeah.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Well, it's really interesting though, to hear that your live work is, is a loop oriented. Are you saying that you literally do the creation of the layers live through stack looping? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Luke: </b>
      Yeah, exactly. Everything, not everything entirely like I use drum machines. So the sequencer is, is the control of that. But, you know, Katie has about three loopers herself, maybe four. Now Dave has four loopers. Like he has a bunch of
      synthesizers and sequences as well. And I, I have a couple of loopers, one for the voice and one for the bass guitar. And yeah, so it, it, it is, it is there as it is basic. We have the control of muting sequences for the <span
        style="color:red" data-ts="221.7" data-end_ts="222.15" title="221.7" id=c_"221.7">__spices__</span> and stuff. Generally it's like we try and do it as, as much on the fly as possible to, you know, just build it up, build it up. And our songs
      on the records, the way that they're written is with that premise, we go into the studio, we press record. We've got all of our equipment in front of us and we just work loop layers. And when we want to bring it down, we take the players out.
      And after we finished recording, when we listen back to it and we go, okay, what, you know, sometimes that could be a wall of sound. There can be so much going on. So we listen back to it and we go, okay, that's not needed. That's needed, you
      know, and then we start to, you know, pick it apart and produce it if you will.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Yeah. I w I would say that, there are aspects of your music that just hearing that are really kind of hard to mesh together because in fact, your music is very layered in, and some of it is your choice of instrumentation, you know, the sound
        of drum and bass, but with also, you know, synthesis a lot of processing, I would say that the, one of the things I hear is a lot of, of processing of all the layers, but also just like stacks and stacks of layers. And it's really hard to
        even imagine that having, a live, you know, there being an opportunity to do that life. That seems a little intimidating. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Luke: </b>
      I mean, that's one of our biggest challenges that we were finding now, cause we're doing rehearsals for live sets and stuff, and it is, you know, it always comes back to that. Like sometimes we've used like seven synthesizes, doing the same
      pattern, on a track. And so when we come to play it live, we're like, well, we can't take a mood Voyager, Anna Moog, minor tour, and a prophet and a dah dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, we've, we've got to figure out how we can create that thickness
      with, with little right. And sometimes that's kind of trust and reliability on the venue and the sound system itself and being like, right, let's just, let's do our stripped back versions in, in quotations. And, and, and just see how much we
      can beef it up with the layers that we can create.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>I'll admit that one of the things that I did as part of, as part of, figuring out even what, how to describe the band was I, I did the thing that I should probably never do, which is looked up your Wikipedia page, where it says you started
        off as like an experimental folk thing, which there's a mismatch between what I hear today and that kind of phrase, what is, what is, what was the, the Genesis of the band? Well, </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Luke: </b>
      The Genesis, so Dave and I have known each other since we were really, really small, like three, four years old and around 16, we got into, we got into playing music and that was more like rock and indie sort of music. He was very guitar, bass
      drums, but one thing at that age, I got quite obsessed with, just the active, looping, not knowing what middy is not knowing what synthesizers really are. Just thought they were keyboards. We got really into loopers and, and then me and Dave
      went down this rabbit hole of, oh, what if you got like a delay pedal and a reverb and phases and, you know, blah, blah, blah, fast forward four years, we go to university and we meet Katie and Katie, Katie was very shy in the sense of like,
      she, she would never sing in front of anyone.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Luke: </b>
      She would just be in a bedroom <span style="color:red" data-ts="442.51" data-end_ts="442.66" title="442.51" id=c_"442.51">__like__</span> singing and we would overhear and be like, oh my God, what's that? And then, you know, as well, she'd be
      playing the cello and be like, oh my God, there's a cello. The way the folk experimental thing came about is it was like this intrigue of like, let's get a microphone, let's put it in front of the cello, let's loop it, let's cut it up with
      these loops. And so we just started making music like that, just experimenting with whatever sounds that we had, which were essentially a bass guitar, a normal guitar and a cello. And instead of, you know, making folk music, we would just kind
      of mess with it and kind of destroy it a bit. That was the basic introduction of us as three people playing music together. And at that time we were, you know, we're just broke 19 year olds.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Luke: </b>
      We, we didn't have any money to string together cause we're students. So we, we never even thought about buying a synthesizer and learning keyboards or learning a drum machine or a sampler. It was only years later where we were going out to
      more clubs in the city and, you know, we were heavily into deejaying and, you know, just that sort of electronic music production, we always really thrived off it and enjoyed it, but never really understood how it was made. Ableton was getting
      more popular. I think it was around Ableton seven sort of time. And we were like, oh, okay. That, you know, you can just draw in your drum and we're learning more and more that, you know, there are these tools and these things that you can do
      that will, that will progress something else. And we can just put down the guitar and play a different instrument. And it was the first time that we actually thought, oh, like let's, let's not focus on the guitar and the bass anymore. Let's
      like focusing on tinkering with these mad sounds that you can create. That just seems so foreign to us. I think that was the appeal as well. You know, it's foreign. Yeah.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>It is. It, it seems right. The idea that it has seemed so alien, but you still get a chance to play with it. Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="571.91" data-end_ts="572.27" title="571.91" id=c_"571.91">__Hm__</span>. So I, it's hard for
        me too, though, to think of starting off with loopers in ending up with something that is like really beat driven and really synchronize the way that you do. I mean, so often when people, especially if they come from a background with guitars
        and stuff, first of all, the louvres tend to focus on people doing solo work. Like, you know, I'm going to do a guitar line now I'm going to do the baseline. I'm going to do a backup vocals and I'm going to sing over the top of it. Right.
        It's oriented more towards a single person, sort of like developing a set of layers. How is it that you like relatively early on, got this idea of like having collaboration with, with looping, cause that's sort of like the antithesis of
        almost people use loopers. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Luke: </b>
      Yeah, I guess, I mean, at the time I <span style="color:red" data-ts="625.73" data-end_ts="625.88" title="625.73" id=c_"625.73">__was__</span> quite naive thinking about it. Like we, we didn't really, there wasn't many loopers that had middy
      either. So we were using loopers that didn't sync with anything. And it was only, it was only after we were getting fed up that we were, we couldn't just leave the loop to let it play that we were like, we need to find something that we can
      just sync and just like, it will just, it'll just be in time. You know, at the time we would be playing with a drummer or I'd have a drum kit and somebody else would be looping and I'd try and play the drums. But I was going all out at a time.
      And I guess that's where the introduction of we'd always talked about like MPCs. That's the introduction of when we started going fully electronic is the, I bought an MPC 1000 and then Dave or a cog Ms. 2000 synthesizer and, and a PNL and a
      Looper that could be sinked sure. From there, it was like, right now we can, now we can do the, the keys side of things and loop it with drums. But we also don't have to just have a simple drum beat. We can, we can sample stuff or we can layer
      stuff. We can layer stuff. We can, we can mix and match how we do it. That's really interesting
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>That the MPC was kind of like your entree into sequencing again, something that is really popular also often drives people towards more, you know, an awful lot of the MPC styling tends to be more, you know, hip hop based rather than, rather
        than house space. Although it was, it was really popular in host world, especially at that timeframe of the MPC 1000 you saw a lot of house producers using using that as well. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Luke: </b>
      Yeah, for sure. I mean, totally under appreciated it at the time, knew it could do so much, but at the time it was like, this is just too baffling. MIDI sequencing is here. I'm just going to use it to put in the sounds and, and loop it. And it
      was only like years later where you buy more gear and you're like, oh, I can actually plug this, that yeah. Plug it, synthesize it into it. And then I've got a <span style="color:red" data-ts="761.91" data-end_ts="762.27" title="761.91"
        id=c_"761.91">__middy__</span> loop and you know, it goes deeper and deeper, like, like so much gear.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Did you ever pursue any kind of like educational path to try and figure some of this stuff out? Or was it all made up at the, on the cuff? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Luke: </b>
      We kind of fell into being musicians. You know, like my university degree was in documentary photography. Dave's was in graphic design Katie's was in fine art. So we were just art students, just, just doing this in our spare time. And it was
      only until like 2013, 14, <span style="color:red" data-ts="799.32" data-end_ts="799.47" title="799.32" id=c_"799.32">__where__</span> we bought the MPC in 2012, 13 and the <span style="color:red" data-ts="803.61" data-end_ts="803.94"
        title="803.61" id=c_"803.61">__scents__</span> and stuff. And it was only around then when somebody heard some of our tracks, they were like, oh, I'll put that out on a record. And we were like, yeah. Okay, cool. Do a 50 50 deal for a year.
      You know, it's, it's no skin off our back. It's just, <span style="color:red" data-ts="817.1" data-end_ts="817.19" title="817.1" id=c_"817.1">__it's__</span> different. And, and then it just exploded it, like we had, you know, like half a
      million and half a million plays of the, of these songs in like a month. And we were just like, oh wow.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Luke: </b>
      People, people are really enjoying and it got played on radio and yeah, we, we <span style="color:red" data-ts="833.72" data-end_ts="833.85" title="833.72" id=c_"833.72">__were__</span>, you know, we were like, okay, let's figure out how the
      players live now. Then I guess it's like, and we're still using a bit of drums and cymbals and you know, me and David swapped between guitars and bass and stuff, but, yeah, it's, we just kind of fell into it and by falling into it, we, we just
      got more and more obsessed, I guess, with making it sound better. Like why, why is it doing, you know, why is it phasing? What is fame? And it's, it, it is just a case of our own. We're all very DIY. And so it just, just reading about it and
      getting absorbed into it is, is what we do when, when we're, when we're gripped on something really.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>That's really great though, because what that also means is you're not relying on somebody like spec sheet or something to determine whether it's going to work for you or not. You're like plugging it into a mixer and finding out if it sounds
        right for the way that you do music. I mean, that makes a lot of sense, but it also, it, it probably leads you to some pretty bizarre revelations. I mean, are there things that surprise you because they became inexplicably became part of your
        sound? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Luke: </b>
      Yeah. Yeah. There's many things really. It's so funny because you start off with like, I see photographs now and I've literally just got an MPC and a Looper and a mixer with all my channels running into the mixer and then out. And that's how I
      used to run everything and I'm looking at it now and I'm just like how I get it, because I listened to those early tracks and it's like, there wasn't much going on. There's a lot of space compared to our newest album where it's like, there's a
      lot of layers. There's a lot more layers because we've learned how to balance the layers for one. But also we've learnt how, how to harmonize certain things. We've learned that, you know, stupid things like, you know, a base channel frequency
      should be going through similar base channel frequencies as opposed to something that's high hats.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Luke: </b>
      Do you know what I mean? Right, right. We were just so naive and just learning what, what to do. You know, Dave is also a lot more, he's got a lot more in-depth with it as well. Like he's the soda, man. You know, he, he, he's making his own
      boards. He's, he's designing his own, his own rig and how to wire it he's kind of the guru of the group. So when we're, when we're a bit lost, we just go a day. I take a while because I know Dave would w give me an answer and then he will carry
      on with the possibilities of what you can go with. And it's like, no, no, no, I don't need that answer. I needed the original question. So it's like, I'll hold off for as long as possible until I'm like, Dave, it's been two weeks. It's do my
      head in, I can't figure it out. Do you know how it's, how to do it? And he'll, he'll be able to figure out in a few days or a day,
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>But in a way that kind of aligns with your role in the group, which was kind of your, you really are involved in the production end of it. Right. And one of the roles of our producers started to say, okay, give me the whole palette of
        colors. Now I'm going to, I think that we need to limit it to these colors, which it sounds like it, it sounds like from a collaboration standpoint, you found a really comfortable way of working with each other, working with the technologies
        that you interact with, but also working just musically with, with this stuff as well. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Luke: </b>
      Yeah, for sure. Out of the group, I find myself, you know, like I was saying earlier with our, with our processes that we go in, we record whatever's our fingers tips. And we, we listen back to it. I find myself when we come to producing it, we
      rerecord it. But I find myself always loving that, that first recording, because it's, it's, there's, there's a lot of freedom within something that makes it organic. And when you are always putting it to a grid and producing it and making sure
      that it's super tight, which you need to do with electronic music in a sense like house music, especially is always very quantized, right. We're always kind of fighting that edge of like, you know, w we need it to still have that, that freedom
      that organicness, that was created in the first place. And the only way you can recreate that is by having it be as free as it was originally. Right. I always find, you know, w we always like tinker it with it and tinker with it and keep going.
      And I always find myself going, no, let's just, let's just go back to the original or just stop rather than keep on going. It's like, why, why are we going on for another, like week doing this when it sounds good already?
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Well, but, but again, that is, that is sort of like one of the most difficult parts of production is knowing when to say, when, I mean, when you hear about horror stories in production, it's always like, you know, well, I ended up with 120
        tracks of guitar or, you know, in how do I even cope with that? Right. It's, sort of like now the ability to be obsessive compulsive is one of the horror stories of doing production. Yeah. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Luke: </b>
      We're quite good as a three because, because we've known each other for so long, our friendship is always first over the band. And so when we're in, in the studio, we can say anything freely, cause it's a safe space. You know, it doesn't mean
      that you appreciate what they've said. I mean, like there's been points where you've been really knocked up by the, the opinion that's been thrown at you, but, you know, it's like, no, it's, it's fine. Like, that's, that's cool. We can, we can
      work on a compromise or we can work on the harmony to make sure at the end of the day that the product or the final result is what we're all happy with. And yeah, I feel like all three of us would say is that we wouldn't put something out. If
      all three of us weren't happy. It still wouldn't be
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Done. Now, unlike a lot of the artists that I speak with, your music is very much focused on vocals as a way of portraying meaning, right? Which means that it's on one hand, it's maybe a little less abstract than instrumental music, but on
        the other hand, it means that from a development standpoint, there's a lot of, there's a lot of things that require attention. And I guess this is where I I'm. I imagine I listened to the music and I imagine the creation of the music and
        especially hearing about the process that you use to bring it together. I think that there has to be a significant amount of effort. That's used to basically say on one hand, we have the ability to develop a wall of sound. A friend of mine,
        one time said <span style="color:red" data-ts="1274.32" data-end_ts="1274.49" title="1274.32" id=c_"1274.32">__that__</span> the downside with most modern musical instruments now is that you could create all the sound, right. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Each person can create it all. And, you know, there's a downside to that because you can end up with this wall of sound, but you have a specific responsibility though, of being able to carve out space for a vocal to sit, to be able to carve
        out space for in, you know, the cello especially is a very vocal like instrument. So that too has this kind of a space that it needs to own. You mentioned before that, that a lot of your work is involved in balancing either some sort of like
        harmonizing the system as, as you're putting tracks together. What is the, what is sort of like your, strategy for creating stuff that does allow for vocals to have their upfront and center space? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Luke: </b>
      He does a very good job of writing this unique melody. Anyway, she's got a very good talent of, you know, when we do it in the studio quite often, it won't be like just saying words and just figuring out it will. She'll she'll think of, her
      melody and she'll sit on just that for quite a while. And she'll, she'll go back and forth of like, what is the right words to fit in to what I've written here? And so we just, we just give her the freedom to do it, essentially. If sometimes
      she'll, she'll come in and she'd be like, oh, I've written this new part for this song. Do you think it works? And sometimes it doesn't work as much. And we, we have to say, we think it doesn't need any vocals or we think the space has, is
      already there.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Luke: </b>
      What you've originally created. She's very open or we're all very open because at the end of the day is a collaboration. So it is, it, is this <span style="color:red" data-ts="1402.68" data-end_ts="1402.92" title="1402.68"
        id=c_"1402.68">__a__</span> tuning and froing of like, what, what works here for the song rather than just being like, no, this is going to be, this is going to be a powerhouse of a song. This I can, I can hear it all already. It's like, no,
      we just need to feel it out. Or sometimes we'd be like, there's, we've got the instrumentation of the song. And it was like, Katie, we need something here. W what, what, what you think of, what, what can you get? And, you know, it, sometimes it
      happens quick. Sometimes it happens slow, and it's just like, well, just come to us when you think you've got something.
    </p>

    <p>

      <i>Well, this is really interesting though, because it really does kind of point to the sort of like collaborative process that you have for production. And it's sort of like the, again, the antithesis of what I think of as like typical music
        industry production thing, where you have <span style="color:red" data-ts="1452.61" data-end_ts="1452.79" title="1452.61" id=c_"1452.61">__a__</span>, a producer who comes in and very efficiently, tries to assemble the tracks necessarily to
        do a release and then move on to the next project. I mean, you, you have, it sounds like you really organically grow these pieces over time and together, which is really great, but, your music has a, an incredibly like modern production sound
        and quality. Do you work with external mixing engineers or other producers or something that helped you sort of like tailor, the resultant sound or is this all stuff that you're making up on the fly? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Luke: </b>
      A bit of both through the different projects have had different things. So the first records that we ever did, my first DP, we, we did everything because we were just, you know, no money, no <span style="color:red" data-ts="1507.21"
        data-end_ts="1507.51" title="1507.21" id=c_"1507.21">__sales__</span>. Right, right. Like, it was like, we don't know how this has just put out. Let's put sure. The second one, we produced it all and we'd mixed it. And our manager said, no,
      we need, we got a new manager at the time. And he was just like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1526.05" data-end_ts="1526.32" title="1526.05" id=c_"1526.05">__wait__</span>, this needs to have a step up, have a punch. So he brought in, or
      the label who signs that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1534.18" data-end_ts="1534.81" title="1534.18" id=c_"1534.18">__EAP__</span>. It was metropolis studios in London. Oh yeah. They were like, oh, well, we'll use one of the mics and
      engineers to do it. So they got a guy there called Liam Nolan. And we heard the first, the first mix we heard from him, we were like, wow, this is, this is, this is just has elevated what we made.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Luke: </b>
      And then there was another guy that did it, and he did a few songs, but there was a lot more back and forth. And one of the tracks, we were just like, no, we're going to mix ourselves and get out. And then the first album that we did, we were
      kind of stuck. Really. We kind of had these songs for like three years, some cases four years is this the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1579.03" data-end_ts="1579.78" title="1579.03" id=c_"1579.03">__***<inaudible>***__</span> album, the
      Omni time collection. So we had a whole bunch of songs and some were pretty much done, but a lot of them were just like, we need to finish this. Otherwise we're never going to get an album out. And so we went to a guy that we had met in the
      past, who runs a studio in Bristol called alley charm. And that was really great. Cause it was the first time that we had worked with an external producer in the room.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Luke: </b>
      <span style="color:red" data-ts="1610.22" data-end_ts="1610.64" title="1610.22" id=c_"1610.22">__Somebody__</span> that was actually a professional with like dream equipment equipment that we couldn't or can't afford still. And that was really,
      really, you know, we learn a lot in the space of like six weeks because the stuff where there's three of us going back and forth, not signing something off when you've got somebody else that you're paying to be like, you know, time is money.
      He's like, well, let's sign this off. It's like, okay, great. Yeah, that sounds good. That sounds good. That doesn't, let's change that. Dah, dah, dah. So we, we worked quite closely with valley charm, but you helped us like really push those
      songs and finish them for the album. And then this album, we knew we wanted to step up from the Omni tome, but we also knew that we wanted it to be a bit sonically, different. We had written it all in the basement in the studio, but when we
      were talking about the project, we were like, right, let's actually get a mix engineer for the whole album.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Luke: </b>
      And we love Liam Nolan stuff. So we were like, let's, let's get, go back with Lim. Let's see if he's up for mixing it. And so before having the finished project, we got Liam on boards and he was totally up for, so that was really nice reworking
      with someone that we had worked with three years previous. And then we also, we then had the same thing where we, we had the songs, but we just couldn't finish them for the life of us. We had one song where we had just, we had played every
      instrument in the house and we still were just racking our brains been like, how the hell are we going to, like, where is this? And so we went back with Allie again to his studio and we were like, Allie, help us, man. Like we, we we've tried,
      we've really tried on this one.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Luke: </b>
      And then he, he basically would just take on board what else our, our vision is and how big we want it. And he would, with the Omni tone, Allie did all the mixing. And because we had got Liam on board for this album, we were like, it was a bit
      hard to say it to <span style="color:red" data-ts="1736.49" data-end_ts="1736.73" title="1736.49" id=c_"1736.49">__Allie__</span> as well, but because he's a friend and he understands, he was just like, I get it. You've got somebody on board.
      You, you want a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1742.37" data-end_ts="1742.88" title="1742.37" id=c_"1742.37">__different__</span> step up from the sound. So Allie helped us produce and finalize the stuff that we couldn't. And then we sent it
      off to Liam, to get, to get mixed again.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>That's great. So one of the things that can happen when you work with external producers or mixers or whatever is you learn in the process too, right. Just from watching them operate, what did you come away from those people? I mean, sounds
        like both Liam and Ali were ha were really instrumental in helping you complete projects, but also get the sound that you want. D were there things from working with them that you came out of the process knowing better and, and put you in a
        better position for making your own <span style="color:red" data-ts="1783.93" data-end_ts="1784.11" title="1783.93" id=c_"1783.93">__tracks__</span>? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Luke: </b>
      Yeah, for sure. I mean, with Liam, we've always, when we've spoken to him, he he's so chilled that we, we send him the track and we'll be like, okay, so what did you think of our mix? Like, have you had to do much work to get it to where you
      have? And he would just be like, ah, you know, I just, I just tamed that on the compressor and I just did this. I didn't have to do much really. I just, but it sounds wildly different. With Allie, just watching him in the studio is really fun
      and interesting because he's got a lot more equipment than us for starters. But like for years, just racking your like racking brains about like, what's the right microphone to use, or what's the right four or five microphones to use on a drum
      kit or vocals, like what preamps is he put in it through?
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Luke: </b>
      And then what compression is he doing it? Like what sort of gear and why is he using it? And like watching somebody do that, that just seems so very fluid going over to a Neve <span style="color:red" data-ts="1850.58" data-end_ts="1851.3"
        title="1850.58" id=c_"1850.58">__173__</span>. And it's been like, June, June, June for Allie, it must be a bit annoying because we could spend half an hour just quizzing him and he'll be like, oh, I get back to work. We're like, okay. But
      yeah, it seemed valuable just even watching him on pro tools. We don't use pro tools. We use Ableton, but watching him just even cut up tracks and spice them back together, just learning things like that, that you blow little tricks that you
      could do in Ableton to, to stop degradation of sound or like little clip cut out points that hadn't even thought about before, or even cross fading clips together. So you, yeah. So you don't get all of these horrible noises and cutting it out.
      Yeah. A lot of utility based things really, which is <span style="color:red" data-ts="1903.83" data-end_ts="1904.13" title="1903.83" id=c_"1903.83">__important__</span> in recording. Yeah.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>That makes a lot of sense. And, and I can imagine that, that, when you hear things like lock in, it's really important for you to send them to say, okay, that was a 10 73. And to mark that down now, again, I was kind of like sucked in to
        having this interview <span style="color:red" data-ts="1922.61" data-end_ts="1922.91" title="1922.61" id=c_"1922.61">__be__</span> because of the pictures of the studio. You have no lack of equipment. There is no, there is no shortage there
        that you're working off of. And I mean, I saw everything from like the old boss, half racks to a real centerpiece, which is the mug Voyager. It seems like that has a real prime position, but also you work at a kind of a large format console.
        It's clear that, you know, going all the way back to your MPC days, having a mixer as part of your development process is really a key part of how you do your work right. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Luke: </b>
      Of the show. Yeah. Like, even like you said about <span style="color:red" data-ts="1961.96" data-end_ts="1962.23" title="1961.96" id=c_"1961.96">__Allie__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1962.23" data-end_ts="1962.38" title="1962.23"
        id=c_"1962.23">__and__</span> learning, like he uses a Trident. I can't remember what it is, but it's a very big console and just how he was rooting it. We were using an Allen and he Zed our 16. We were using that for years and that's fine.
      Cause it's, you know, it's a nice, it's a nice sort of, beginner's home studio desk, you know, you've got six channels and it goes straight to your computer. But the biggest thing that we found that happened is that you just get, you get
      digital noise or you get clipped. So you get pops that shouldn't be there because I guess the FireWire conversion over to the computer. And we just basically realized that, Hey, we need more channels. You can never have too many channels.
      Right. And just the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2010.29" data-end_ts="2010.8" title="2010.29" id=c_"2010.29">__rooting__</span> of it, we've, we've got like a, a different Allen Heath desk now, but the way that we route it is, you know,
      like 32 channels coming out of the computer, but 32 channels that are, I guess, our tape, but it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2023.52" data-end_ts="2023.64" title="2023.52" id=c_"2023.52">__are__</span> straight in that we can, our
      monitors channels.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Luke: </b>
      But you know, just having the effects on the orchestra is that you're, you're able to control and having them routed all around the studio, like when we did the album, we did an overhaul, like a big overhaul of buying new equipment because we
      had learned quite a bit from Allie. If like, right, we need, we need bad. Pre-amps for Katie's vocals. We need better preamps for the drums we need, that a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2053.19" data-end_ts="2053.58" title="2053.19"
        id=c_"2053.19">__preempt__</span> for the Rhodes. I bought a whole, I got into modular at the same time. So it's like, right. How can we, how can we re insert? So Katie can be singing and then I can take her feed and mess with it on the
      modular. So she's singing away and not knowing that I'm looping her and manipulating her voice, just things like that really where we could not be afraid of not staying at our stations.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Luke: </b>
      We didn't want to just be like, oh, I do the bass and drums. It was like, no, I want to play the, I want to play the piano. So play the piano, you know, it's, it was kind of like this freedom of, you know, I don't want to do the bass. Katie got
      a bass synthesizer. So she's doing the base, Dave's doing the drums. You know, it was, it was a very much like let's just open it up more than we ever can. It's kind of worked it, it would be good to <span style="color:red" data-ts="2105.82"
        data-end_ts="2106.02" title="2105.82" id=c_"2105.82">__do__</span> more. It's it's always the problem. Isn't it. You want to do more, you want to add more. And it's only when you get to listen to it, it's like, right. Take it away, take it
      away. No, of
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>All that equipment, especially the effects. This is the place where I saw the greatest variety was in the effects. You guys have a lot of like guitar pedals kind of laying in every corner. You've got a lot of kind of rack stuff. You've got
        delays, you've got all kinds of stuff. What, what you would you say from an effect standpoint, really our primary pieces for creating, creating your song. Cause I would say you very much have a sound kind of like this dark thick, layered
        sound, and it's kind of lasted throughout, you know, even in what you call kind of like a more primitive time it's always had that kind of voicing. Right. What is it that, to, you really represents the tools that, that make that sound. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Luke: </b>
      Yeah. That's interesting. That's interesting thing to pick up on actually, which makes total sense really when we first started, I remember me and Dave just being obsessed with plate reverbs. Like the first DP is just a plate reverb or all of
      the time can sound snow moody because it's just like, all right, how do we make that sound like bigger and crazier? It's just like put it through a bigger plate or just, just put it through eight plates, you know? So we really, really loved
      plates back then over time, we, I mean working with <span style="color:red" data-ts="2203.58" data-end_ts="2203.91" title="2203.58" id=c_"2203.58">__Allie__</span> as well, we, we've got to fall in love quite heavily with spring reverbs. They
      were just so percussive and beautiful, especially on drums and like little, you know, short sort of sounds having that trail of
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Little of boiling Springs. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Luke: </b>
      Yeah. It's really nice. And I don't know, there's something very like dub and reggae about it. There's like, yeah, we, we always fantasize. I mean, I've recent, I've become more and more obsessed with delays of, different varieties like
      striving to doing or have been doing some incredible effects for years now. And we've been pretty hooked on them for about four or five years. The phaser on a guitar. Dave's always obsessed with that. We got quite obsessed again, I guess, with
      the what's it modeled on the, the harmonizer for Katie's vocals, the, the Evan tide harmonizer. I can't remember the numbers now, but it's like the famous one that David Bowie and Tony Visconti use to like fuck with the fabric of time they say.
      But, we, we got a couple of page nines, so we were messing around with that and sound toys plugins because it, it creates an amazing width.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Luke: </b>
      Especially with Katie's vocals live. She messes around quite a lot with her at vocal effects creates a deeper octave, as her backing. Interesting. Yeah. Which sounds oddly quite like me. So when I'm singing, there's kind of two of me and then
      when we play live, that's wild. That's amazing. Yeah. Just like I said, I I've got into your rocket at the past year and the way that I got into your act compared to Dave, Dave went in the normal way of going, right. Let's let's, I'm a surplus
      first, right? Yeah. Yeah. And the way when I was starting to do my research on it and built up my modular rack on most of the grid, Dave was just like, you've got no sense here. These are all the facts. And I was like, yeah, I just want an
      effects rap. And David's just like, but what's the point?
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Luke: </b>
      And I was just like, you'll see, man, and you get a clouds and the clouds it's, it's more than like a reverb it's, it's it's mind bending, like what it can do the same with like the, the make noise <span style="color:red" data-ts="2353.48"
        data-end_ts="2353.66" title="2353.48" id=c_"2353.48">__mirror__</span>, your phone, like, right. That thing is, I, I want that as a, as a desktop effects unit because it just, it just does some mad looping stuff. I mean, the beauty of it is
      that you can modulate the hell out a bit we've CV. Yeah. I mean, I've just been blown away with just how, how much opportunity there is really. And now I've started to get into the synthesis side of it, but it's just too easy to add a delay and
      double your, what source you're putting into it. Yeah. So true. So true. Well look,
