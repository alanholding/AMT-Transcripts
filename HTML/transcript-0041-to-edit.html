<b>Darwin: </b>I first got to know Dan Nazel, because he ran across my concept <span style="color:red" data-ts="11.48" data-end_ts="11.7" title="11.48" id=c_"11.48">__for__</span> Arduino based module, some years ago and contact me and wanted to get it working in his Euro system. And then he opened the door to talk about, actually producing a eurorack based, commercial module out of it. And thus the, Euro version of the ARD core was born. He's been a pretty tireless supporter of that concept. He produced, an expander board for it. That was really pretty awesome. And I actually use his version of the art <span style="color:red" data-ts="48.38" data-end_ts="48.62" title="48.38" id=c_"48.38">__corn__</span>, my own system. I of course use <span style="color:red" data-ts="52.14" data-end_ts="52.26" title="52.14" id=c_"52.14">__a__</span> standard 20 objects, one in my five U system, so I'm just up to the hilt with art, art <span style="color:red" data-ts="58.18" data-end_ts="58.42" title="58.18" id=c_"58.18">__course__</span>. But he also, kind of pointed me to the work that he had been doing on guitar pedals and subsequently on modules, which included, a lot of things that used, chaotic behaviors. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>In order to provide content. It's really, an interesting area of, exploration. And the thing is, is it produces deep modules, modules that maybe don't necessarily excite you 12 seconds in, but are able to provide you with a lot of interesting, conceptual basis over the long run. There's a class of modules that are like this. I think probably the most, the most popular one out there has been the, grant Richter's <span style="color:red" data-ts="104.86" data-end_ts="105.06" title="104.86" id=c_"104.86">__walk__</span> book. But, in reality, Dan's work with, chaotic behaviors and attractors and stuff like that really kind of pushes the envelope on the interaction of science and, and music technology. So I wanted to interview him, have a chance to chat about where he's coming from, what his perspective is, and why he chose to make the kind of modules he did. I hope you enjoy this discussion. All right. This week we're going to be talking to, Dan Nazel. I am very, pleased to be able to get a little of his time. We've kind of been <span style="color:red" data-ts="146.06" data-end_ts="146.34" title="146.06" id=c_"146.06">__chasing__</span> each other around for a little bit, trying to get this scheduled, and luckily we were able to put it together. Hi, Dan. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan Snazelle: </b>Good. How are you doing today? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm doing all right. A little, a little off kilter. A friend of mine died over the weekend, and, I'm having to kind of cope with that a little bit. It's pretty rough, but, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>Well, sorry about that, <laugh>. That's, thanks for taking the time to talk to me today. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, it's, my pleasure. I, I've been looking forward to this discussion because, I find that in the world of the modular synth stuff, you have a real unique view on, making some, making modules, of kind of a particular bend, which is, I guess would be like somewhere in the, in, in between ultra creative and plain wacky, right. <laugh>. I hope you'll, I hope you'll accept that as a, as an identifier 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b><laugh>. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. So what I, I will have prefaced this with a little discussion about the work that you do, but, a lot of your stuff has like, random factors in it and, chaotic factors, which makes me really curious about your background. What is, what is your background and how did you get to the point of making guitar pedals and modules that, kind of embrace that kind of brain? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>Well, I think that, you know, it's, it's not so much that I make guitar pedals and modular stuff that embraces that. It's that sort of everything I do, embraces those ideas. And I think that for me, when, you know, back in the day when some people sort of said to me, Hey, Dan, you know, you should start a company. The only way I was willing to do it was if it, you know, was an extension or a continuation of ideas that I've been interested in or pursuing my whole life, well, not my whole life, but my whole artistic life. And, you know, for me, I've always seen, it as, as an art project, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="283.46" data-end_ts="283.74" title="283.46" id=c_"283.46">__yeah__</span>, I do sell the things, but at the same time, I'm trying to create tools both for my own work, but also for other musicians to be able to explore, new territories in sound or in composition and, <span style="color:red" data-ts="298.08" data-end_ts="298.3" title="298.08" id=c_"298.08">__and__</span> actually take it kind of seriously. Not in the sense that I'm, you know, like boring or uptight, but just that I think that, you know, synthesis is a really exciting tool that's available to artists, you know, in this century. And there's so much more, exploration still to be done. So it, for me, it's, you know, science is a big part of it, right. And I, I really like the parts where science and art meet. So that kind of goes back a long way for me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, tell me, tell me about the back <span style="color:red" data-ts="338.06" data-end_ts="338.18" title="338.06" id=c_"338.06">__a__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="338.18" data-end_ts="338.34" title="338.18" id=c_"338.18">__long__</span> way, part of it. How did you get started, playing with these kind of processes and ideas? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>Well, it, it is actually kind of funny because if you go way, way back in my life, there's a real, anti or a very rigorous anti-scientific bent to the way I was raised. I was raised extremely fundamentalist Christian, and was not allowed to pursue science or philosophy. I went to a church where, you know, we were basically told that, evolution was wrong, and that rock music was satanic. And that most ideas that, you know, make up, modern scientific thought were labeled as liberalism or humanism, and were not to be trusted, especially in my household. So, you know, I had a very turbulent childhood, but some of my earliest memories are of my, my mother, you know, throwing my brother's books into the trash can, or tearing down our posters and stuff. So I think that, you know, for me, one of the reasons I'm so intense about a lot of things is probably because I have that classic having to rebel against something, <span style="color:red" data-ts="420.26" data-end_ts="420.46" title="420.26" id=c_"420.26">__right__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>At a pretty early age. So, you know, I got, because I have older siblings, I got introduced to the very things I wasn't supposed to pretty early on as far as rock music. Luckily my sister, you know, turned me on to Elvis Costello and the Cure and r e m probably when I was, you know, 10. And that's all you need is that, you know, initial push, the violence, fems, things like that. And I was the kid who, I guess I was, this was 19 89, 19, it was sixth grade. And my brother who's older and who had a job and stuff, somehow it, it was decided that he would buy a four <span style="color:red" data-ts="472.34" data-end_ts="472.58" title="472.34" id=c_"472.34">__track__</span>, a Fostex X 26, and I would learn how to use it. Okay. And maybe that, maybe that wasn't the original idea, but that's what happened. You know, he had his little brother who was, you know, much younger than him, read the manual and try and learn how to use the darn thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>And that machine had a pretty convoluted sub <span style="color:red" data-ts="494.08" data-end_ts="494.3" title="494.08" id=c_"494.08">__mix__</span> structure. You had to put it into a different mode to bounce down or to mix down. And, you know, so really early on, you have to understand I was going to huge, huge churches, the kind of churches that fit maybe 1500 people, 2000 people. Okay. And I knew right away that I wanted to be involved in sound. And this one church I went to had a program that was open to, you know, everyone that went there, that if you wanted to learn how to do sound, they would subsidize you to take these classes that were put on at a, a church. This was in the Boston area, okay. Suburbs of Boston. And I was like, you know, in sixth grade, little, little kid. And I went to these classes with all these like 30 and 40 year olds. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>And it was great. They taught you, you know, polar patterns and phantom power and how an EQ works, how a compressor works, how a, a big board works. And I shadowed the main, once I took those classes and they decided I was like, safe to work with the equipment. I shadowed the main engineer at the church. And this church, you know, these are three and a half hour long services, sometimes even longer cuz they have a, a band, they have, you know, a praise and worship section. They have a sermon and it's all off the cuff. It's not like a 30 minute sermon you might get at a, a Catholic church. You know, it's, it's completely unscripted, right? So you never know it's gonna happen. And you have a stage that's comparable to, you know, a pretty darn big rock club with, you know, maybe 10 mics, any of which could go live at any time, monitors on stage. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>So there's a monitor mix, there's drummers, keyboardists, everything. And you have people speaking in tongues running up and down the aisles who might grab a mic and start prophecy prophesizing into the microphone. I'll never forget, you know, the first time that the main engineer, you know, he was thrilled to have some kid that would let him go, you know, sit with his family while I took over. Right? And the first time he really let me do that, somebody ran up onto the stage, and of course I wasn't quick enough and we got some feedback. And I'll never forget the pastor saying, oh, you know, we've, we've got a little one up there today, everyone in the church turning around and looking at me. And it was just, you know, complete embarrassment, right? But, you know, they weren't being mean about it. But, so I learned that was like my, you know, trial by fire to learn when you're doing live sounds, you've always gotta be, you know, on top of things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>And so that live sound and learning, my brother's four track, I I started a band, with actually a guy who nowadays is, is pretty successful. A man named Ryan Power. He has records out, on some labels, really good stuff. But anyway, we had a band called Quantum, and this was junior high. We did the Cure and r e m covers also originals. And we made a tape, which I guess I produced of all originals, and I still have a copy. And it is so hissy <laugh>, it's the most hissy. It's like, you know, because back then you, I would use these low bias concert <span style="color:red" data-ts="704.18" data-end_ts="704.4" title="704.18" id=c_"704.18">__Ma__</span> Radio Shack tapes, and I would do high speed dubbing on my mother's Montgomery Ward dual tape deck, and we'd sell them at school for three bucks, right? But the problem is with high speed dubbing, and granted, I was no professional engineer, so I didn't really know what I was doing. And so the only remaining copy I have is like, you know, I've tried to use, you know, bias and sound soap and all that stuff, and it's so hissy, but you know, you, that's how you learn. <span style="color:red" data-ts="737.61" data-end_ts="737.9" title="737.61" id=c_"737.61">__Well__</span>, that's true. And so by That's true. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>You know, so by eighth grade, by the time I was, you know, graduating junior high, I knew really in a very solid way that I loved recording that I was always gonna have a four track or some kind of means of recording and that I also like technical stuff, but you know, that some of that comes later. But you have to understand the same time that this is all going on, that I'm starting to get into live sound, starting to, to do all this stuff. I'm also starting to doubt all the things I've been taught my whole life. And it's not something I'm into now. But my brother gave me a book by Anne Rand, called Atlas Shrugged, and I think this was like sixth grade. And that was the first book I encountered that, you know, didn't say God exists, didn't say There's a Heaven <span style="color:red" data-ts="797.18" data-end_ts="797.46" title="797.18" id=c_"797.18">__that__</span> said the exact opposite. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>And while Anne <span style="color:red" data-ts="799.98" data-end_ts="800.18" title="799.98" id=c_"799.98">__ran__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="800.18" data-end_ts="800.38" title="800.18" id=c_"800.18">__as__</span> kind of sophomore philosophy, it was to a very young boy, extremely powerful because it, it talked about, you know, living for yourself or ideals, questioning things, different forms of really, I mean, it talked about epistemology and metaphysics and things that I'd, I'd been raised to not question. I'd been raised to always think I was gonna go to hell. So this was like, you know, throwing gasoline on a flame. And after Quantum broke up, I shaved my head and was in a punk band and, you know, started getting to the Sex Pistols and the Clash. And of course skateboarding was a big factor. So junior high, it's like I, I got technically proficient or started to, or wanted to, started getting into recording and into, you know, mics and things like that. But also started getting into science and philosophy and interested in, you know, just interested, sort of exploding as someone who wanted to learn. And of course that was not something my mother was happy about <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>So, and then I got, my parents got divorced and I got sent to boarding school. Oh <span style="color:red" data-ts="882.9" data-end_ts="883.1" title="882.9" id=c_"882.9">__man__</span>. So, and then, you know, so fast forward to high school, I got into, and man, I mean, my age, I'm 38, 19 90 to 1994 in America was like, oh my God. I mean, we were so lucky music wise. I mean ride, my Bloody Valentine just as far as like 19 90, 91, you had the whole Shoegazer thing, right? But you also had, you know, the Pixies, you had so many things going on in America, dinosaur Junior, and I was just being flooded with music <laugh>, and got into bands like Spaceman three, which things like Spaceman Three and Loop and Slow Dive. And My Bloody Valentine had a really big impact on me as far as production goes. I started saying, wait a minute, how are they getting these sounds? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>What are they doing? And I remember hearing, ministry for the first time, and all those syncopated 16th notes that are so obvious to me now is sequenced. Right? Well, I had no idea how they were doing it. I mean, you know, when you're a little kid, maybe now it's completely obvious to kids cuz they have things like garage <span style="color:red" data-ts="954.69" data-end_ts="954.98" title="954.69" id=c_"954.69">__band__</span>, but you know, in nineties America, you were pretty lucky to have any kind of midi equipment at that point mm-hmm. <affirmative>, or <span style="color:red" data-ts="962.17" data-end_ts="962.46" title="962.17" id=c_"962.17">__even__</span> any sequencing. So, you know, I had a Cassio tone, but you know, the kind of things, the Ministry album, the Land of Rape and Honey, the, the synthesizers also on Skinny Puppy, <span style="color:red" data-ts="976.46" data-end_ts="976.66" title="976.46" id=c_"976.46">__two__</span> Dark <span style="color:red" data-ts="976.86" data-end_ts="977.1" title="976.86" id=c_"976.86">__Parker__</span> Rabies. Those were some of the things I was hearing as well in the early nineties that just, you know, brought that real fascination with technical things, but also starting to creep in with synthesizers, and saying, what are these sounds? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>These aren't guitars. Where are these coming from? And I guess, you know, my school had a, a weird video program, like a telecom department. Okay. Cause you know, we were poor. We had lost everything. When my <span style="color:red" data-ts="1012.54" data-end_ts="1012.7" title="1012.54" id=c_"1012.54">__par__</span>, long story short, I ended up living with my dad in this really rich town called Lake Forest. Okay. Which is a suburb of Chicago, right. Like where Mr. T lives. Right. And that high school was really nice. It was actually in an old mansion. Part of the school had like marble floors and stuff, and they had for the time a very high tech telecommunications department. So this is really the second real point where I'm like, oh my God, you know, I have access to open reel, two <span style="color:red" data-ts="1044.42" data-end_ts="1044.7" title="1044.42" id=c_"1044.42">__track__</span> reel <span style="color:red" data-ts="1045.14" data-end_ts="1045.26" title="1045.14" id=c_"1045.14">__to__</span> reels, svhs editing decks, you know, with the jog shuttle controls. This is before non <span style="color:red" data-ts="1052.06" data-end_ts="1052.22" title="1052.06" id=c_"1052.06">__letter__</span> editing had kind of taken off. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>But we did have a video toaster and we had, you know, we had satcon, cameras that we could, the, you know, the kids that were kind of weird, you know, maybe the the stoner kids that I was friends with, that I was part of that group. We would go in after class, take over the little fake TV studio and aim all the cameras at the monitors, <laugh>, put 'em through <span style="color:red" data-ts="1078.84" data-end_ts="1079.06" title="1078.84" id=c_"1078.84">__pro__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1079.16" data-end_ts="1079.38" title="1079.16" id=c_"1079.16">__key__</span> and do video feedback. Sure. And we made these, we made these compilations of video feedback going through the toaster. They also had <span style="color:red" data-ts="1087.9" data-end_ts="1088.06" title="1087.9" id=c_"1087.9">__an__</span> an old analog Panasonic deck that made a lot of stuff similar to what you might see with the Lzx system, you know, as far as video synthesis, where you're getting square waves, sine waves, et cetera. But you're seeing it. Right. And, and that, that was just mind blowing to me. But, you know, it's funny looking back because I, I, I still had no real formal structure for any kind of artistic thought. It was all just kind of a mishmash of, let's see what happens. You know, throwing paint at a wall kind of stuff. Right? Sure. And an, and an art, I was doing really abstract stuff, process art, you might call it. And I actually got banned from the art department because they said I was using too much paint 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>You know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1137.92" data-end_ts="1138.24" title="1137.92" id=c_"1137.92">__because__</span> I, I would do these huge canvases where I would layer and layer and layer and I guess I was using more paint than my art fee allowed. So that was no longer allowed. But anyway, so that was, telecom was kind of the second big thing. And if it hadn't been for my brother who was both a good and a bad influence, I probably would've gone to school for film because, you know, I, I won awards for telecom and I had a teacher who was really pushing me to get a scholarship. But, you know, my big brother <span style="color:red" data-ts="1172.37" data-end_ts="1172.72" title="1172.37" id=c_"1172.37">__kinda__</span> pushed me towards going to school for philosophy. Oh my. Which is what I did. Okay. Totally useless as a major. But that's what I ended up doing. But oh, another important thing, or maybe not, I don't know, but in the grand scheme of things, in high school I met one of my really important musical partners for many years. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>John Hughes, who is actually the son of the director. And we, we put out three albums as a band called <span style="color:red" data-ts="1205.71" data-end_ts="1206" title="1205.71" id=c_"1205.71">__Bill__</span> Ding, which in the nineties, you know, we were on CMJ Top 20 and stuff. We did pretty well and got good reviews and, worked with Critter mm-hmm. <affirmative> as an engineer who had worked with ministry and stuff. Right. And that's some of the music that, you know, I'm, I'm really proud of doing and we still talk and stuff. So that was another important thing cuz John had a 16 track reel to reel in his house. He had, a June oh 60, that's the first time I ever saw like a polyphonic analog he had. And he had a Sonic EPS 16. So he was really into sampling. I mean, he was amazing. He would like, you know, remix BC boys tracks or Public Enemy tracks and go out live with an mc and, you know, sequence them live. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>I'd never seen anybody do anything like that. You know, he didn't have an mpc, but he had, he had, you know, the, the basic tools. And so I encountered sampling, encountered, you know, a large console mixing board, et cetera. So that kind of sets the seeds for a lot of things, you know, so sort of all while all this is going on, I'm getting more and more interested in science. And when I go to school for philosophy, I actually have sort of a breakdown because philosophy, the more you get into it, and the better you get at it, the more you cannot talk to any of your friends anymore because everything is so layered that if they don't know the person who's referring to the person who's referring, they're not gonna know what the hell you're talking about. Sure, sure. And so it caused a really radical problem for me because I would go to my professors and say, look, I, I can't talk to my friends and say, don't worry about it. Once you're an academic, you won't need to talk to these people. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You won't need friends. <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>Well, you'll talk. They're like, you know, you'll talk to other academics. Right. And they were sort of, they were sort of pruning me to, you know, learn German and, you know, go the whole nine yards. I was taking graduate classes as a sophomore, you know, really getting into phenomenology and things like that. You know, it might be called continental philosophy. Right. In America. And, you know, I, I read on the road for the first time, which may sound cheesy or cliche, but you know, the idea of diving into experience for experiences sake, which was something that, you know, my brother had always cautioned me against. He was a real, like, logic, you know, as I said <span style="color:red" data-ts="1363.86" data-end_ts="1364.06" title="1363.86" id=c_"1363.86">__and__</span> Ram, he was like super into logic and reason. And he always told me that Carac was no good <laugh>. So I read on the road and proceeded to drop out of all my philosophy classes and never went back to them because I realized that all I was doing was reading books I wasn't experiencing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>And I took Carac really seriously for a while, maybe a little too seriously. Right. And sort of, that was the first time I dropped outta college. But it's also, you know, during that time when I'm like, you know what? I'm not gonna go to classes, my philosophy classes anymore. That's when I started really collecting, you know, I always had four tracks, but by this point I'd gotten <span style="color:red" data-ts="1407.18" data-end_ts="1407.3" title="1407.18" id=c_"1407.18">__a__</span>, a micro move at a yard sale for 25 bucks and, you know, like a, a beat up micro move. It had like, you know, mice poop in it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>That kind of a thing. And I, John, John gave me a Yamaha CS 15, which is a, a great monophonic synth mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And I had a little boss drum machine and a four track. And that's really where, you know, it just kind of exploded as far as my interest in technology. But also, you know, in science, and you have to remember, this is like 95 by now. Okay. And Drummond bass is exploding. Ambien is exploding. I'm hearing the orb for the first time. I'm hearing, you know, orbital, but also like the fax compilations. I'm hearing techno, you know, just a bunch of different stuff. And I'm putting out real full length albums with buildings. So I'm, I'm going to Chicago tracks, or crc I'm going to real studios. So many things are happening at once. And it was really kind of where things started coalescing because I got it really heavily into, that's really where I started reading a lot more science, a lot more chaos theory, complexity science. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>You know, there was a lot of talk around that point in the nineties. You'd hear all the time this term paradigm shift, everybody was talking about, you know, how science was changing. And chaos theory and complexity science were really, creating a lot more interdisciplinary. A a lot more people were coming together. It wasn't just, you know, physicists staying with physicists or artists staying with artists. You actually had cross pollination between disciplines. And that was really exciting. You know, I'm not a MAs guy. I'm not good at things like that. So I sort of had to accept that I probably couldn't go into science. But it was an exciting time because people were reading science and people were talking about it on campuses. At least the people I, and I actually took a class, a multimedia class on Max mft. And that was exciting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>Like, you know, there were all these things starting to happen where more power was being available to the average musician. Right. And John gave me his old EPS 16, I got an MMT eight, and then I started collecting analog synthesizers kind of seriously. And I, that's when, the, the real, you know, explosion point for me with analog synthesis was this band I was in called Lakita Soma. And we did live drum <span style="color:red" data-ts="1575.15" data-end_ts="1575.31" title="1575.15" id=c_"1575.15">__and__</span> bass live techno in house, mixed kind of with, experimental post rock kind of stuff. And, you know, live drums, live sub bass, trumpet, vibraphone guitar, four analog syns being played live and started collecting. Syns started, but I also started going to raves and everything just kind of fell apart from there as far as, you know, being purely a rock musician. I got an MPC and, you know, just sort of never looked back. So that's a little bit of the background of, you know, how science and music and art all sort of got mixed together for me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You and I actually share an awful lot of that same background. I too grew up <span style="color:red" data-ts="1625.94" data-end_ts="1626.14" title="1625.94" id=c_"1625.94">__Okay__</span>. In a, in like an oppressively, fundamental religious, kind of environment. And, I didn't realize that that was your background. Okay. And so I wanna kind of explore something with that because Sure. I, I don't know that many other people that have gone through that background and ended up where we're at. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1647.81" data-end_ts="1648.1" title="1647.81" id=c_"1647.81">__Okay__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I have a conjecture that is because I grew up in an environment where I was not allowed to listen to popular music, that it actually made it so that my ears developed in a different way than most of the other kids that I grew up with. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. You know, I was, I grew up with the music in the church and then whatever, what, what little, most of the, most of the, religious radio my mom listened to actually was like, preachers ranting away. So there wasn't, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>Right. Well, same, same with me. My mom would listen to either cassettes that she bought at church mm-hmm. <affirmative> preachers ranting, or she'd listen to preachers on the radio. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. And so as a result, it, the, the dimensions of the, the sonic background that I grew up with, okay. It's very different from what other people grew up with. And it's always been my conjecture that, that open, that that set me up to be able to hear things differently. So I grew up, you know, once I did my rebellion thing. Yeah. For me, I found that pop music and metal and bluegrass and, classical and it all was equally interesting to me. I didn't necessarily have a favorite kind of music or anything that I was, extremely passionate about because it was all, to me, it was all new and all music, practically all music had some sort of like, rebelliousness built into it. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>Well, plus it's just the idea. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1760.42" data-end_ts="1760.62" title="1760.42" id=c_"1760.42">__And__</span> in a way, and like my take on that is just the idea that you are allowed to listen to it. You know, it's this precious thing because when you tell a child that they can't have something or that, you know, there's this whole world that you're not supposed to be encountering, there's gonna be some kind of reverence for it if you get exposed to it. At least that's how I see it. But, you know, there was, I just real quick, I want to tell you one thing before I forget. There was a case where, when I was in that punk <span style="color:red" data-ts="1791.7" data-end_ts="1791.98" title="1791.7" id=c_"1791.7">__band__</span> in seventh grade and I had a sex pistol tape, and of course my mother didn't listen to it. She just saw the word sex and freaked out <laugh>. She locked, she locked it in a suitcase in her bedroom and then locked the bedroom door. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>And by this point, my parents were divorcing. So my dad had been away for like a year. So it was just my mom and I, cuz my brother and sister had graduated. And my level of passion for trying to get that music was so intense. And it sounds kind of, you know, crazy now, is that I took a hammer, smashed the doorknob, you know, broke into the bedroom mm-hmm. <affirmative> right. And destroyed the suitcase to get the tape out. I wanted that tape so badly and was so tired of being told that I couldn't have the music, that I just completely rebelled and said, I want this. And as you can imagine, my home life was, you know, complete chaos at 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That point. Right. Sure. Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1854.1" data-end_ts="1854.26" title="1854.1" id=c_"1854.1">__What__</span> was, but 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>Anyway, so, so go back to what you're saying. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, you know, I just, I just like, I just wanted to explore that a little bit because I think that the process of not, I mean, now, you know, certainly my, the family that I'm raising, my, my kids, I'm introducing them to all music and, and trying to have them embrace the value of all music. But I realized that the reason that I grew up embracing the value of all music is because it was all wrong and so <laugh>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1887.9" data-end_ts="1888.18" title="1887.9" id=c_"1887.9">__Yeah__</span>. It was, it was all equally, exciting and equally valuable. Right. And equally kind of dirty, you know, but, in, in a wonderful way it was. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>And isn't that such a dilemma for us as parents? You know, I have two boys and the problem is, it's like, you know, if you, if you let them listen to all this great music and you don't, you don't repress them, it's, it's almost like I worry that they're not gonna have the same, you know, bombastic drive to discover things. And hopefully they will, and hopefully they'll find their own path and stuff. But it's, you know, I, I kind of feel like people who are oppressed and, you know, I, I've met other people who, you know, not a lot, but I've met other people who've grown up in these really, really dogmatic families. They usually turn out to either be really, really messed up or really, really talented mm-hmm. <affirmative>, you know, because they have so much that they're having to, to work against and that working against something can be such a catalyst. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1958.02" data-end_ts="1958.3" title="1958.02" id=c_"1958.02">__Cause__</span> you know, children don't necessarily have an ethos or an ideology or a goal, you know, qua goal. But if they have something that they have to fight against, you know, it's almost like an automatic drive that they just, they have to get past it. They have to get away from it. And I think that as much as it's, it's, it's painful to look back on a lot of my childhood. You know, I wouldn't trade it for anything cuz it, it made me so much of who I am. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I agree. Now you talk about, sort of your embrace of, and, yeah. Your, your embrace of science and technology mm-hmm. <affirmative> mm-hmm. <affirmative> kind of happening. When, when you talk about that timeframe, it reminds me of a lot of things. It was like the early days of Wired magazine, the whole techno <span style="color:red" data-ts="2011.76" data-end_ts="2011.98" title="2011.76" id=c_"2011.76">__pa__</span> Yeah. The whole techno paganism thing was coming in. Yeah. Yeah. Terrence McKenna was rattling around in all of our heads. Right. Right. And, <laugh>, and there was this, there was this sense of sort of like chaos and chaos theory as being some sort of like elemental, elemental portion of our souls and, and sort of like one of the bedrocks of, of an improved humanity. I mean, was that kind of the milieu that you found yourself in as, as all these things started, started coming to the fall for you? Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>Yeah. I mean, I, well, first of all, I don't, I don't know if we're the same age or not, but the thing is, is that for me, I was, okay, there was a book that came out and it's funny you mentioned McKenna because there was a book that came out that was called Chaos Gaia Aeros. And it was by Terrence McKenna, Ralph Abraham, and I can't remember the other guy. And that book was kind of a distillation of everything you're talking about. It was, it's funny now because so many of these ideas are just, you know, they're commonplace now. They're completely taken for granted. Right. And people growing up now wouldn't even think of them as anything, you know, out of the ordinary. But like you're saying, a lot of these ideas, I think what happened, and this is before my time, but in the, when chaos started becoming popular as a science within the science community, and you have to understand that it, and you may know this or you might not, it was considered, you know, a lot of people hated it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>A lot of other scientists were very against it. Because it, as far as mathematicians went, a lot of them thought that it was too much, like, you know, getting their hands dirty, dealing with real things. It wasn't abstract enough. Some scientists thought that it was too, you know, interdisciplinary. Some people thought it was just a bunch of pocus focus <span style="color:red" data-ts="2135.65" data-end_ts="2135.94" title="2135.65" id=c_"2135.65">__that__</span> it wasn't real. That there wasn't enough data to prove it. And I know that, what's his name, the guy, the, Lorenz Lorenz, like the really, one of the most key figures in <span style="color:red" data-ts="2151.48" data-end_ts="2151.7" title="2151.48" id=c_"2151.48">__ca__</span> theory, he was really rallied against, and was considered kind of a crack pod by a lot of people in the beginning. But as it gained steam and as it became more and more popular, it also sort of somehow got picked up by non sciences. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>And I think that was good and bad because you started getting a lot of those books that were sort of like, you know, the Dow of physics mm-hmm. <affirmative> or, books that sort of compared Eastern thought to physics or compared complexity science to Buddhism or whatever. And some of those books were really great and generated a lot of good ideas, but they also did some to discredit it in some people's eyes. Sure. And I think what was going on from my perspective, it felt like, wow, you know, things could really change. These ideas could really, you know, help shape society or help change things. It was very exciting and it, it felt, no, granted, it's also part of being young. It, it felt as if, you know, I I was, you know, on the crest of a wave something that was really gonna make a difference. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>Right. And I don't think I ever lost that sort of excitement about, and, and, you know, it's not as if complexity science is dead. It, you know, it, it's still very young. And, you know, ideas like cellular <span style="color:red" data-ts="2232.77" data-end_ts="2233.06" title="2232.77" id=c_"2232.77">__auto__</span>, automata, neural networks, you know, obviously things like chaotic contractors and, and things like that are, it's, it's not like those are outdated ideas. They're still extremely young. You know, I believe that the chew circuit, which is in, a modified version of one of the chua circuits is in one of my products, the, the dreamboat, and I believe, I could be totally wrong here, but the Chua circuit was developed by a, a Japanese man was either the late seventies or very early eighties. That was kind of the first physical electrical representation of chaos where they could build it. And every time it would create, you know, chaos and they could say, look, it's not just a theory to <span style="color:red" data-ts="2283.46" data-end_ts="2283.58" title="2283.46" id=c_"2283.46">__I__</span>, it, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2284.18" data-end_ts="2284.42" title="2284.18" id=c_"2284.18">__cause__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Here's the manifest manifestation of it. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>Exactly. And you, and you can build it every time and it'll, it'll do it. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Right. And to me, that is so beautiful. The same way that when I, I first started reading about complexity science, and it's funny you mentioned wire because Kevin Kelly, he wrote a book called Out of Control, which was, I believe, published around 95, 96. And you know, he, I believe he was the editor of Wired and it took all these ideas, a lot of stuff about bees and ants, cuz those are, you know, one of the poster children for complexity science and all these wonderful ideas about organic systems and the hive mind and, you know, not top down thinking, but bottom up. And when I was, when I first decided to, to make a module, but of course the first thing I said was, you know, I wanna do something related to these ideas throughout the whole, the whole system that I make. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>Because for me, when I get a bunch of those things going, when I get a, a chaos brother <span style="color:red" data-ts="2347.94" data-end_ts="2348.14" title="2347.94" id=c_"2347.94">__in__</span> a dreamboat and, you know, maybe some cross coupled oscillators or just a bunch of systems that will go into complex states, you know, not random, but not completely periodic either. Right. It's like there's entities in the room. I love it because you can, you can get a bunch of them going and just see what happens. And you don't always notice it when you listen to it as audio, but if you use it as a control source, it's phenomenal. I mean, that, that guy, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2379.61" data-end_ts="2379.83" title="2379.61" id=c_"2379.61">__the__</span> Untold, he's a UK producer, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>He, he uses some of my modules and what he does is he takes the Chaos brother and the dreamboat, he takes the outputs of them, and he somehow converts it into information for his computer, which he then sequences melodic lines with. And he's sent me files where he was using chaotic modules as the springboard, and they sound like, you know, fully fleshed out compositions mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And, you know, a lot of times when people just listen to the audio output of a chaotic module, they say, well, this sounds kinda like noise. But within that noise there's so much information. And to me it's just wildly fascinating. And I think it's something that people are just kind of scratching the surface of. You know, because there's, there's tons of different attractors. There's, I mean, there's cellular automated explorer. There's, I'd love to get into neural nets and there's just so much out there. And that to me is just so exciting. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2447.45" data-end_ts="2447.8" title="2447.45" id=c_"2447.45">__Cause__</span>, you know, if music is the area that I have decided to work in, I don't wanna just be passively, you know, I do write pop music and I do write many, many songs. I've written hundreds of like, songwriter kind of songs, but I also have a lot of reverence for like, you know, astronauts and explorers. I wanna be trying to do something that, you know, may have some small impact on the future. And I think that's important. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I, I think that's, that's an awesome way to approach, approach the work that you do. Let's talk a little bit about the modules that you create, because I think that Okay. It's not always obvious how each one, how they differ from each other, but also how they can work together as a group, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2498.86" data-end_ts="2499.1" title="2498.86" id=c_"2498.86">__because__</span> Sure. I like this idea that we talk about the, the depth of, of the functionality and the depth of the complexity. Because one of the things that actually really got me excited about some of your, cast modules was, one time I saw a video that you did where, if you listen to the sound, it was like one of those modular make a bunch of wacky uncontrollable noise things, right. <laugh>, but you also had a scope hooked up to it, right, right. Where these beautiful patterns were being developed. And just because the, just because the audio output was this, brash, chaotic mess. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>Right, right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>When you saw the implementation through the scope, you just realized, oh my God, that despite the fact that there's this craziness of, of a sonic footprint, there's this patterning and there's this, this depth and this order. It's just not the first order complexity. It's like fourth order. You know, you have to, you have to go past the gloss of the obvious in order to find some of the, some of the really real details in these modules. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>I'll be the first to admit that, you know, my modules are pretty uncompromising. I don't <laugh>, I try and make a module the way that I think that it'll be most powerful mm-hmm. <affirmative> and that it'll, because I, I have kind of a, a grand, not grand in the sense that it's awesome, but like I have a sort of a plan for how all these modules will work together. And when I just came out with the first one, the dreamboat, I think a lot of people were confused and we're like, you know, first of all, because chaos, and I've been told this time and time again from dealers and from people who just didn't get it, that, you know, nobody knows what to do with chaos. And that's true and it's not true. I mean it, in the beginning, it was definitely true. Ian Fritz has had quite a bit of success with his chaos modules and he's done a lot of work to bring some of the academic, stuff from other researchers into the world of synthesizer modules. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>And he was a big inspiration to me. But, you know, he works with what he does. There's, as I said, there's so many different types of attractors out there. There's so many ways of approaching it. And what I wanted to do was sort of ultimately create a system. And I'm, I'm getting there. I mean, I have seven modules now. And, and the next one is about to come out where you interlock them in such a way that you can create, you know, generative music or music that you, you're, you're flying it, you're, you're at the controls, but it's also flying you. And it's a system and hopefully a complex system. And, you know, the telephone game, which just came out this year mm-hmm. <affirmative> was sort of the culmination of a lot of those ideas because the telephone game works perfectly with the chaos brother. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>And the chaos brother works really well with the yard <span style="color:red" data-ts="2682.98" data-end_ts="2683.22" title="2682.98" id=c_"2682.98">__core__</span> and the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2683.7" data-end_ts="2683.86" title="2683.7" id=c_"2683.7">__yard__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2683.86" data-end_ts="2684.1" title="2683.86" id=c_"2683.86">__core__</span>. I mean, and obviously the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2685.85" data-end_ts="2686.14" title="2685.85" id=c_"2685.85">__yard__</span> core, it can do so many different things. And that, that module, well, you know, that module, I mean, you know what I'm talking about. It's right. It's, it, it's a, it's a great thing because it can do so many things. And by the way, that's one module that I really want to get more people to understand. I think that's a module that a lot of people are scared of. You know, that's the thing, when you talk about any of these modules, if it's not a vcf, if it's not a vco, if it's not an lfo, if it's not immediately accessible, it can oftentimes be intimidating for people. And I think that there's different, levels of users in the modular community. You have guys who've been doing it for years who know their way around pretty much any synthesizer you put in front of them. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>And then there's guys who've just gotten started who are just learning what a filter is and what a VCO is. And I think that, you know, sometimes people make the assumption that something is crazy or hard or ridiculous because they're, they're not used to the parameters or they're not used to how it might function. You know, the yard core, for example, you know, you made the very smart decision of a USB port, and that right there is a smart decision, but it also scares people, right. Because they see a USB port and they think, oh my God, I'm gonna have to know how to program. I, I, I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Don't, or I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2778.74" data-end_ts="2778.82" title="2778.74" id=c_"2778.74">__ha__</span> or I have to have the computer hooked up all the time and I don't wanna do that. Right. Exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>Right. And, you know, when I play live, and that's another thing is that my modules, and I mentioned this earlier, I make things, I would not run a company if I was making products that I couldn't use in my own art. Right. Because I don't, I don't run a company just to be in business if I don't believe in what I'm doing. If it's not something functional and exciting, there's no point in doing it, you know? <span style="color:red" data-ts="2810.06" data-end_ts="2810.34" title="2810.06" id=c_"2810.06">__Cause__</span> it's, it's not as if it's easy. It's so much work. But, you know, when I play live, if I have a system with a couple <span style="color:red" data-ts="2818.22" data-end_ts="2818.5" title="2818.22" id=c_"2818.22">__hard__</span> cores in it, wow. I mean, the possibilities are endless. You know, I just load up something different or hit the reset button, literally on those, you know, combination patches mm-hmm. <affirmative>, you hit the reset button and there's four different things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. But, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>You know, the telephone game, the way that it works with the other modules, you know, I had to really, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2843.3" data-end_ts="2843.58" title="2843.3" id=c_"2843.3">__really__</span>, and partially it's my fault. I have to work, I have to get better about, you know, documentation and education. And it, it can be hard as a one man operation because the longer you're in business, the more customers you have, the more products you have. If you're still just one person, you're just, your being at baseline every day. Like just to the point where you've answered all your emails, you've taken care of everything that point in the day gets farther and farther towards the end of the day. You know, when you first start off, you only have a few emails a day. Right. But after five years, you know, it could be three in the afternoon before you've gotten through all the administrative stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>Right? So the telephone game, when it first came out, a lot of people thought, oh, this is just an analog shift register. Or, oh, this is just a sample and hold. And those are both true, but they're also both not seeing the whole picture. The way that I designed it is very different than most other analog shift registers. And it's really meant more as a way to once again, help create, complex and or random patterns that, you know, are good for generative stuff, are good for interfacing with other generative modules, and are great in a live context for creating stuff on the fly. And you know, for me, I felt really, really good about that module because it, it's doing really what I want to be doing. When I get it going and it's suddenly creating weird bossanova patterns or techno stuff and it, it's going and it's like a, once again, it's like an entity or, or an organic system that's in the room and you don't know what it's gonna do next. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>You can feed it punch cards or you can feed it food <laugh> and you can be part of the process and you can be like, happy that your pet is doing something cool, but you know, ultimately it has a mind of its own. And you know, one of the things that impressed me so much about what the Untold is doing with my chaos modules, it's like he just completely got it. He, he saw that these are streams of information that you can interact with and just get such rich data out of them, which you can then use as a springboard for creativity. And, you know, if you feed the output of the chaos brother into the telephone game, you're giving it something that varies over time. Same with the hardcore, if you load up the fact drums sketch and the <span style="color:red" data-ts="3003.3" data-end_ts="3003.54" title="3003.3" id=c_"3003.3">__hardcore__</span> has, you know, the CVNs, if you take the dreamboat and you take the x y out and you put them into the two CVNs of the hardcore on the fact drum sketch, and then you give it, you know, a regular clock, you get drums that continually change mm-hmm. <affirmative>, the pattern will always be changing. Right. And it doesn't sound crazy. It doesn't sound like, you know, some guy just knocking over his drum set. It sounds good. It sounds like, you know, a continually changing drum beat. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I think that that's, that's the important thing. And, and in a way, I think that there's a misconception or there's, there's a misstep taken because a lot of people hear someone talk about chaos and think in terms of random 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>Yes. Oh my God, you, you know, it, this is the whole part. This is the whole problem, is that chaos had a had meaning as a word before, it had meaning in the scientific community mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And it doesn't mean crazy and, you know, nonsensical <laugh>, it, it doesn't mean, you know, your modular is exploding and just making a bunch of white noise. Right. White noise is really what people are thinking about when they think of the word chaos in the standard sense. I think they think of something that's totally random, that's just a bunch of noise. And that is crazy. And I'm not the guy to explain this on a mathematical level. I'm not the guy who is really that good. You know, I'm more of an intuitive person. I, I definitely know when I've created chaos in a system, I, I, I can see it on the scope mm-hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b><affirmative>, I know how it behaves, but, you know, I'm not someone who can really understand the <span style="color:red" data-ts="3112.26" data-end_ts="3112.5" title="3112.26" id=c_"3112.26">__math__</span>. But I know when something like, you know, there's a lot of, pseudo random or, you know, ship register based noise makers, whether or not those become chaotic is something that I'm interested in, but they don't necessarily become chaotic. There are systems out there that vary over time that change, but that don't ever actually reach a, a chaotic state. And this is a really weird territory for conversation when you're trying to talk to a beginner in synthesis, or even just to somebody who's never, you know, talked about it and you're trying to explain to them why the chaos brother is different from a white noise generator. Right. And it's not an easy thing to do. And usually I end up just trying to patch it up and say, look, here's the difference. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>But even then, you know, it's so comes down to how you make music because these, you know, chaos as a tool is just another color. It's just another way of getting from point A to point B. And even though it can generate stuff, it's still in certain hands can still sound like a bunch of nonsense <laugh>. So I mean, like what you're saying, people think of chaos as one thing, and I've actually been thinking more and more that in the future, you know, I might not use that word so specifically in the product names or in the manuals because it, it's just, it ends up being a lot of work to try and explain it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I, I understand that. Now, the flip side of it is, I, I think that, that your modules are a, among the few modules that have the kind of depth that rewards study, right? Like Sure. For, for example, the telephone game. The telephone game is actually a great example in that, you know, on the surface you could imagine it to be one thing, but it, it's one of those things where every time you'll spend an hour <span style="color:red" data-ts="3244.68" data-end_ts="3244.9" title="3244.68" id=c_"3244.68">__or__</span> two learning the nuances of one of the controls, you end up, you end up gaining something that would be very, very difficult to do in any other, in any other way. That is almost the antithesis of what a retailer wants to hear, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>Oh, exactly. Yes. And this is the super problem for me as a company. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and it's, and my question is, is it really a problem or is it just the way that some companies have to exist? I mean, one of, one of the problems with, with an environment like the modular synthesizers if mm-hmm. <affirmative>, if you only focus on making things that are immediately gratifying. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What you develop is you develop, an environment, that's too simplistic for long-term value. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>Well, because what you do is recreate basically the voice architecture of a profit Right. Or something like that. Right. You know? Right. Where you, you give people modules that they can create sins, voices that they're used to mm-hmm. <affirmative> and might sound really great. And there's nothing wrong with that. It's just, you know, for me, it, and for many others that I know modular is like, you know, it's this great open frontier, right. It's sonic exploration. It's, it's so many things. And it, you know, it's almost as if when it, it died and went away for a while, you know, on the, on the grand, you know, marketplace, it was like a, it's almost like somebody lost the plot. Like, you know, how could this go away? <laugh>, this is such a beautiful open-ended thing. And granted, there's, there's wonderful analogs to it in software and, and that's great. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>But, you know, sometimes people like to have the, the physical thing, as well. And I think that when I say it's a problem for my company, what I mean is it's a problem for me making a living. Oh, I see. Yeah. Right. Because, you know, it's been very, you <span style="color:red" data-ts="3376.22" data-end_ts="3376.38" title="3376.22" id=c_"3376.22">__know__</span>, I'm, I'm lucky that I have been able to survive and, you know, I have some of the best customers in the world who they buy every product I come out with, I have some of them who, you know, they say as soon as it's ready, you know, just let me know and I'll send you the money. You know, I have people who have me build them custom stuff or, you know, just weird little things I make cuz they know I need the money. And I'm not saying that I'm, I'm like, you know, a failure or anything like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>In fact, you know, we had our best year ever. It's just that when I see the marketplace and I, and I see, you know, the systems that are out there, I know that if people could just get a chance to sit down with them and quote unquote get the modules, that a lot more people would probably enjoy them. Right. It's just how do you do that on a retail level? Because, you know, whether it's a store or an online thing, they're gonna probably push the things that are easier to explain because they might not have the time to spend even two or three hours with every module. When you consider how many manufacturers there are now and how many modules to get something like The Chaos Brother, which is a really simple module, you probably wanna spend at least an hour with it. Right. To be able to explain it to somebody mm-hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b><affirmative> and to be able to really explain something like the telephone game probably is even more time. Right. I did a demo at Control who've been very supportive of, of snazzy effects and who've, you know, always carry the stuff, et cetera. I did an in-store demo where I spent two, two and a half hours just talking about how the telephone game worked, <laugh> and it, it wasn't a super packed audience, but everybody who was there was, you know, asking a lot of questions and, you know, there's a lot to go over. Right. And, but I think the reward of that is that when you buy one of my modules, there's a lot to go over, but it's not like it's, you know, rigorous, boring study you study by using them. I always encourage people to write, you know, write me questions or to email me if they get stuck and, you know, they're kind of modules that you can grow with and that you'll find new uses for them. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>I, I still find new uses for them. I try and design them in such a way that they're, you know, they're almost like a, a puzzle that there's different solutions to and you can use it <span style="color:red" data-ts="3531.6" data-end_ts="3531.82" title="3531.6" id=c_"3531.6">__in__</span>. And I also, you know, try and stick little things on, like how the Wow and Flutter has an envelope follower output. The telephone game has a white noise output. You know, the Chaos Brother and the Dreamboat both have the chaotic gate outs, which by the way is one of the most under noticed functions of the chaos modules. But probably, in my opinion, one of the most important, because you can use it to add a natural live field to drums. You can use it to add offset sequencers. You can do all kinds of crazy stuff with chaotic gates. Once again, a, a situation where you're using chaos as a control parameter, not as an audio parameter. And it really shines in that, that situation. And right now I, I've got like 10 more designs that are on the, they're, they're almost done, you know, and I, the main problem right now is that snap <span style="color:red" data-ts="3589.82" data-end_ts="3589.98" title="3589.82" id=c_"3589.82">__the__</span> effects is one person. Right. I'm designing way, way more than I used to, but I have less time than I used to to bring them to fruition. Sure. So there's a lot coming down the pipe, but it, it's just taking me a little longer. But the, the tidal wave is gonna be really exciting, I think. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I'm looking forward to it. As I look forward to everything that you produce. I'm one of these people that is a big fan, if for no other reason than the, the rewarding nature of what you do and, and how you, put it together. Just the, the idea of being able to sit down with something and having like, almost these childlike revelations as you learn one new function or you try one new output or whatever. It really, it really does leave a lot of room to grow into. I really, I appreciate you taking the time to talk to us about it and to kind of, give us some context, to think of these things. And I think that that actually helps a lot to sort of like humanize the module as well, because then you start thinking of it as, as, you know, where it came from as well as what's just on the front panel. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>And, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3666.26" data-end_ts="3666.46" title="3666.26" id=c_"3666.26">__one__</span>, one just last little bit is, I would say as, as well as humanizing them, you know, I really encourage people to try and think of my modules as, as almost like organic systems. I mean, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3679.16" data-end_ts="3679.38" title="3679.16" id=c_"3679.16">__and__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3679.38" data-end_ts="3679.54" title="3679.38" id=c_"3679.38">__now__</span>, now obviously, you know, our collaboration, the, the, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="3683.02" data-end_ts="3683.3" title="3683.02" id=c_"3683.02">__hardcore__</span> is anything you want it to be. I mean, that's, that's a whole different ballgame. But as far as the, the rest of them, they really are, you know, just try and think of them like your friends <laugh>, you know, you, you, you grow with them sometimes. Sometimes maybe they're not quite right, but other times they are, you find different ways of interacting with them. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And like your <span style="color:red" data-ts="3704.46" data-end_ts="3704.7" title="3704.46" id=c_"3704.46">__friend__</span>, like your friends. Sometimes, sometimes they're, they're more complex than you might want them to be <laugh>, but that's what makes them be, that's what makes them be able to be friends over the long term. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>And you know, by the way, the, the manual for the Dreamboat, which is pretty long, but not in a, you know, a grueling way, talks a lot about these ideas of chaos. It's all my manuals are freely downloadable on the website, under the instruction tab. And I recommend anybody listening, even if you're not interested in, in necessarily getting the modules to check out the manual for the dreamboat, because it does have some, discussion about chaos theory. It also has links, some recommendations on books you can check out. You know, I think that chaos theory and complexity science are things that people should be enjoying and looking into. I mean, as with science, I mean, you know, I think that encouraging science, interacting with, with art is a really good thing. And I, I try and bring that Ben and I, you know, obviously you did with the art core too, that joyful learning. And like you say, sitting down and, and playing with something on the carpet, the yard core, for me to get involved in that project, I had to try and teach myself c and that was so fun and so rewarding. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3787.38" data-end_ts="3787.5" title="3787.38" id=c_"3787.38">__and__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>You know, and 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Those, to me, to me, it's like, it's one thing to say, well, I'm gonna learn c it's another thing to say I'm gonna learn C in a way that I can make sequences occur in my synth. You know, those are two different things. So the second one's a lot more fun than the first. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>Yeah. And it's so rewarding. And that's, that applies to all these things, you know, with, with any of these modules and other manufacturer's modules too. It's, you know, modular synthesis. It's, it's so much a learning thing and it's, you know, maybe to some people that sounds lame or nerdy, but who cares? I mean, what, what better way to spend some of your free time than to sit down with a, with a machine and really an instrument, something that you can interact with and touch and, you know, sit on the floor with, or not have to worry about if you're writing a, a ballad or a pop song or a metal song, but just pure play. And when learning is play, it's so enriching and it, I think it, it's good. It's also good for kids and for, you know, just hanging out with friends. I mean, it's, I think it's modular synthesis at this point in time is so exciting because it's, it can fulfill all these different roles. And that's, that's what worries me sometimes when I hear the constriction or people wanting it to be oversimplified or only a certain way, but I think it, you know, allow it to be whatever it can. And there's so many exciting things going on with other manufacturers too. Yeah. It's a really great time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, thank you so much for your time. I really, appreciate, you taking the time to have this chat. There's a bunch of other stuff I wish I could have chatted about. Maybe we'll get together again, in a little bit and, follow up the conversation. But, yes, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>There's always a future. There's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Always a future in the meantime. Well, I hope, good. Yeah. <laugh>, we're, I certainly am looking forward to the next module and maybe all 10 of these designs that you have sitting on your bench. I'm anxious to see 'em. And, on the site, I'll put some links so that people can check out some videos, of, of the things you're doing. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3924.65" data-end_ts="3924.94" title="3924.65" id=c_"3924.65">__Okay__</span>. But I just wish you the, the best of success. I think it's, I think that in, in the world of options that is the modular system, I think it's important to have the kind of options that you're providing. And so, good on <span style="color:red" data-ts="3938.78" data-end_ts="3938.9" title="3938.78" id=c_"3938.78">__you__</span>. Thanks for, thanks for doing God's work there. And, and thanks a lot for spending time to have this chat. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dan: </b>You too. Bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, and there's the story. I wanna really thank Dan for spending the time talking with me. It was a pretty interesting insight on someone who both, both has a shared background with me, but also someone who really takes the science aspect of music technology. It takes it seriously and really wants to, extend its availability into the Euro rack world. I would strongly suggest if you are into the kind of things that he talked about, that you check out, some of them, his modules. I know, some of the earlier designs are starting to become harder to find. And really they're amazing. The thing to do is to make sure that if you get 'em, you give them sufficient time and kinda let 'em grow on you because, you will be amazed at what you find out about, about technology and science when you start working with that within a musical domain. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I want to, again, thank, all of the supporters out there, opia in particular. They always do a great job of helping people stay aware of what we're doing. And in the meantime, please, if you enjoy these things, drop me a line, let me know, let me know about it. Let me know if there's any people that you would like to see interviewed. I've been getting some interesting emails. Some of 'em may be asking for impractical interviews, but I've been surprised before, so I'll keep on asking. I appreciate everyone's reaching out though. I also wanna shout out to the Boulder Synthesizer meetup. I went out to their barbecue yesterday and had a great time, and everyone was so supportive of what I was doing with the podcast. So just saying, hey to all those folks as well, especially Mark Moser, who's sort of the coordinator for it. So again, thanks everyone, and I'll talk to you next week.
