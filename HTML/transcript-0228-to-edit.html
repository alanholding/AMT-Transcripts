<b>Darwin: </b>This podcast is made possible in part through the support of Recording Magazine. Recording magazine is a great place to find out more about recording tools, techniques, ideas, and directions. So thanks to them for their help. And now enjoy this discussion with Erin Berra. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today I have the great pleasure of getting to speak to Erin Berra. I was first introduced to her by Ben Casey, one of the product specialists for Ableton. He, pointed me at her as having a pretty incredible resume. And I, and when I looked into it, I was pretty stunned. It was in fact an amazing resume. And so she helped me out with an article that I did for Recording Magazine and I took the opportunity to bug her for a podcast interview. And so here she is. So with that, I'm gonna say hello to Erin. Hey Erin. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Erin Barra: </b>I'm so good. Thanks for having me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="66.425" data-end_ts="66.645" title="66.425" id=c_"66.425">__Oh__</span>, thanks so much for taking the time. I really appreciate it. And, I really like the fact that you have a co-pilot with you today. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Erin: </b>I do my, yeah, my five month old son is actually about 12 feet away. My husband is luckily here and holding him, but we, we are in the same house. So you'll, you'll hear him 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Indeed. That's great. Alright, so I gave a really mealy <span style="color:red" data-ts="88.525" data-end_ts="88.725" title="88.525" id=c_"88.525">__mouth__</span> version of, of what you do because you have such an incredible, both resume and current working stacks. So why don't we have you describe what you do? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Erin: </b>Well, I'd say in the past five years, it's kind of been this like pyramid where I'm spending time on one of three projects. So my main focus a lot of the time these days is working for Berkeley. I'm an associate professor there in the songwriting department, but I manage all of their technology curriculum. So it's, you know, I focus on teaching technology tools to really creative people, which is more or less my niche at the college. And I also do a lot of curriculum development for Berkeley online, which is largely, again, creative Ableton curriculum. Right. So it's composition based. And then another third of the time, I, I run an organization called Beats by Girls, which is a, an organization which mobilizes local groups of women to sort of start their own, I like to call them Digital Girls Rock Clubs, <laugh>. Right. It meets like music production, rock clubs for girls. And then the other time is spent freelancing. And those projects are real extremely varied <span style="color:red" data-ts="171.285" data-end_ts="171.525" title="171.285" id=c_"171.285">__because__</span> sometimes I'm working for music tech companies. Like I just, I did a huge project for Rollie. Sometimes I'm freelancing for private clients. Like I'm working for Wayne Brady right now on his comedy, special artists production. It's kind of, you know, whatever comes at me that's not beats by girls in Berkeley. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. In that freelancing work, you kind of have a, you kind of have a nice role on your website that kind of introduces people to some of your production work. And it's kind <span style="color:red" data-ts="203.645" data-end_ts="203.805" title="203.645" id=c_"203.645">__of__</span> remarkable the breadth of stuff you've done. You've done everything from kind of contemporary country to hip hop and everything in between. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Erin: </b>Yeah. I like making music <laugh>. That's, that's the only continuing thread through all of that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. That's great. And, but I, I am really curious about the Beats By Girls thing. I've, I've actually run into, different organizations that have, have talked about it. Can you explain a little bit more about what that organization is, where it's located, and how people, run across it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Erin: </b>Sure. So it started in 2013. We had a single chapter in New York City, and that was at the Lower East Side Girls Club on the far east side of Manhattan. And at first it was just music production classes for school girls, and there was a huge amount of traction and response right away, which is rare, I think for music, music industry, anything. So I kind of knew I was onto something right away. And from there, instead of sort of forming chapters ourselves, we put together the steps and the materials for local women to start their own chapters. So we're really enabling, regional groups of women to, take the steps to make their own beats by girls chapters. And then they get to take ownership over that work and be responsible. So it's, I think, better for both parties. Like we don't have to work hard, and then they also get to feel really attached and per, like, it's their personal work that they've done, which I think is missing in a lot of, the role of helping people. It's, it's strange and convoluted. Yeah. So now we have chapters all over, you know, we've got Boston, New York, LA Bridgeport, Phoenix, Minneapolis, Chicago, Austin, Edmonton, Canada. Like, it just goes on and on. And we get, I'd say maybe four people a month that reach out to us about wanting to start their own chapters. And, you know, sometimes it's not meant to be. And then other times it happens. And we've been growing organically and steadily ever since 2013. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What do you do when people reach out to you? What do you do to sort of like either encourage or discourage them? <laugh>? I mean, do you have, do you have like materials and sort of like a setup pack to get going? Or is it more just, kind of like emotional support that you provide? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Erin: </b>Oh, yeah. We have, there's a page on the website that sort of outlines all the different pieces that need to fall in place for a chapter to successfully launch. I mean, the real issue is that every community is different, right? <span style="color:red" data-ts="373.705" data-end_ts="373.925" title="373.705" id=c_"373.705">__So__</span> being in LA there's a lot more access to, like-minded individuals or DJ production schools or just even spaces where you could hold classes where versus we're starting a chapter in Duluth and that's not the case. So they've had to really spend a lot of time sort of developing, the different things that are necessary. So we, we, you know, we outline what you need in order to make it happen, and then the ways that we can help make that possible. But the, the hard part is beginning, we just sort of get in where we can and help each of these groups of women. So after they sort of peruse the many necessary elements, then we set up a call. We have two women who work on chapter development and sort of see how we can help. And, you know, we just very plainly give it to them straight saying, this is what it takes, this is how we can help. And if they feel like they are capable of taking those next steps, then we hold their hand through them. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I live near Minneapolis, and I know the beats <span style="color:red" data-ts="440.925" data-end_ts="441.045" title="440.925" id=c_"440.925">__by__</span> girls here is connected to the Slam Academy, and they are really excited about what they've seen. Not only, not only in terms of, you know, the support, but just kind of the energy that comes from the whole project. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Erin: </b>Yeah. That, I mean, the women in Minneapolis are very dedicated and they're one of our more thriving chapters for sure. They've, they've taken an idea and created like real tangible results with it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Right. Now let's talk, let's go to the third leg of the triangle here, which is your work at Berkeley. I, I noticed, that you really kind of, you, you have two like significant chunks of teaching, which is a lot about songwriting, but also about music tech. And I, I have to admit, a lot of times it seems like those are really two very disconnected, worlds. Right. But you ha you found a way to connect them in some way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Erin: </b>I mean, I don't think that they're disconnected. I think that's the misconception, actually. Oh, especially in academia, is that, you know, these, these processes are siloed, <laugh> like this, this technical person over here that's behind the glass does all the technical tasks and they don't contribute to the creative elements of the composition. And then vice versa, there's this very creative individual who doesn't understand or know any of the technical aspects of what goes into it. But I was just talking to somebody at the career center, I have to look up, what was the word they used? It was something like shifters or I, it's like, it's like instead of being millennials, it's like this, this generation of people who are, they are multidimensional, are like multi hyphenates, right? Oh, right, okay. Social media specialists slash songwriter slash producer slash manager because they, you know, they require this very wide breadth of skills in order to be employable in what's a very volatile situation in the industry. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Erin: </b>Right. So, you know, more often than not, I think it's, I find it to be very surprising when there's a writer who doesn't know how to, at the very least, demo their own songs. And just that skill in and of itself makes such a huge impact. <span style="color:red" data-ts="583.705" data-end_ts="583.925" title="583.705" id=c_"583.705">__And__</span> over maintaining control over your content or getting results out of a producer that are much more aligned with what your initial vision was. You know, like whatever, however the tech skills manifest themselves. I, I think that all writers or all composers need to have them now. Whereas even 10 years ago, that was not the case. So, you know, for me, when you're, when you approach teaching it, if you're teaching technology to a, create a creative person, then it really only makes sense to teach them those tools through their own creative process. 'cause then they get excited about it, then it makes sense. It seems applicable. You know, there's not a lot of conversation about, you know, how it all works. And it's really focused more on making it work and making music within like the first five minutes of class. And, you know, it's, it's very powerful. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Do you ever find situations though, where someone comes in thinking that they want to be a songwriter and falls in love with the technology part of it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Erin: </b>Oh, yeah, absolutely. I mean, I have students, so I, I do teach the songwriting core at the college. So, you know, I'll have third semester, I think that's like the earliest that I've taught this third or fourth semester students. And they'll come into my songwriting one class and I'll start demoing some of the technology because I use it as a teaching tool also. Right. And they'll, you know, say to themselves, that's cool, <laugh>. Like, I need to know, I need to know more about that. And so then they'll enroll in an Ableton course with me. And then, you know, since I'm teaching it as a writing tool, it's just, again, a further extension of their creativity. And then all of a sudden, you know, you'll have met them when they're 19 years old and they were acoustic singer songwriter, like folk musicians. And then, you know, by the time they're 22 or 21, they're like electronic goddesses or, you know, whatever. Like I've seen, I've seen so many transformations take place, and I think that a lot of them just feel powerful. You know, it's like you gave them every single sound, every single idea, like, and just write at their fingertips. And, you know, that's an exciting thing for a creative person. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I imagine you, you see people just really, really flying once they get access to all that stuff. One of the things that I like doing in the podcast is I like talking to people about, their background and how they got to be the, the artists <span style="color:red" data-ts="733.265" data-end_ts="733.485" title="733.265" id=c_"733.265">__and__</span> creators that they are. And, one of the things you didn't even talk about is the fact that you have a very active songwriting and, and, artist schedule as well. And so you, you kind of have this really renaissance multihyphenate kind of life yourself <span style="color:red" data-ts="750.985" data-end_ts="751.205" title="750.985" id=c_"750.985">__as__</span> kind of an academic, but also this community builder, a producer, a product person, and technologist, but also an artist. Where did you come from <laugh> that you feel comfortable in all these zones? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Erin: </b>I'm from Utah. <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="769.945" data-end_ts="770.235" title="769.945" id=c_"769.945">__That__</span> explains everything. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Erin: </b><laugh> <laugh>, yeah, no, I'm from Salt Lake City and my father is an audio file. So he, I mean, he's just like, lives for extremely high-end audio. And he places speakers for a couple high-end speaker companies. Okay. So, you know, they're like, these speakers are like 900 pounds each. So sort of like when you put them down, that's where they are and they don't move. Right. So he travels, he travels around and just helps people put speakers in the right places. <laugh>, which seems like a silly job, but that's really what he does. <laugh>. So we always had a room in our house that was just dedicated to listening and, you know, he's constantly like swapping out gear and I knew about like ins and outs and signal flow and I was like nine years old. Right. But, and then I was also simultaneously classically trained as a, a piano player from <span style="color:red" data-ts="829.635" data-end_ts="829.915" title="829.635" id=c_"829.635">__very__</span>, like, I think they had me in a music preschool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Erin: </b>So it was just always as far as, as long as I can remember, music was always a thing. Whether I was like a hands-on active participant, but then also a huge amount of time as a passive listener. And I think that those two things combined really, you know, it was everything because, you know, I find that people are typically good at one or the other, like listening or, or, or actually saying something. And I, I happen to be kind of good at both of them. And it came, you know, it came into play as well when I started getting behind the tech tools, is that I could use my left brain, I could also use my right brain. Yeah. Once I, I mean, I went to Berkeley actually. I got a, a piano performance and a songwriting degree from them in 2006. Okay. And then, you know, I never was really encouraged to get involved with technology until maybe I was 25. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Erin: </b>You hear the same story, writers are like, oh, I just, these songs, my records are just not turning out the way that I envisioned them to be. I think this is like a, a tale <span style="color:red" data-ts="900.145" data-end_ts="900.365" title="900.145" id=c_"900.145">__as__</span> all <span style="color:red" data-ts="900.525" data-end_ts="900.645" title="900.525" id=c_"900.525">__as__</span> time. Right. And, you know, I felt that way, but I just, I think I had spent so much time listening my entire life that I literally was just, would not accept things to sound exact anything, but exactly the way I wanted them to. So just one day out of sheer frustration decided I was gonna get behind the computer and just figure it out, because that was the only thing that really made sense to me. So I started with Pro Tools, an engineer friend taught me how to edit. And that was kind of my first step into feeling like I was in control. And then the rest is just history, you know, like after Pro Tools, then I started experimenting with Ableton Live on stage, you know, for the same reasons. You know, like musicians weren't doing what my was in my head 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Weren't doing Right by you. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Erin: </b><laugh>. Yeah. So I started experimenting with like non-linear creative technologies as well, as opposed to just linear dws. And then that, that was sort of like the explosion for me. And, and that's when my career really took off as well, is when I got into using Live on stage and kind of found the tools to articulate things that had been floating in my mind for quite some time. And yeah, I mean, I just, that was it. Once I had all the tools, I just, you know, I was able to engage with so many different types of people and so many different types of projects and, you know, work really hard. And I think that people like working with me. So it just made it possible for me to do pretty much whatever I wanted. And I've been doing that, which is whatever I want for, I'd say <span style="color:red" data-ts="999.565" data-end_ts="999.765" title="999.565" id=c_"999.565">__for__</span> the past six years. And it feels great. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So growing up around an audio file that had to put like, some pretty extreme pressure on what became good sounding music to you, right? Yeah. Did you grow up, were you mostly listening? I mean, when I think the people I've known that have been audio files, some of 'em are like extreme classical purists, and some of 'em are like extreme classic rock purists or like certain timeframes of jazz vinyl or whatever. Right. What, what was your dad into and how did you find that influencing sort of both your tastes and your kind of creative vision? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Erin: </b>Well, he's not a purist in any sense of genre. I mean, he definitely has, he listens to a lot of classical music. Okay. But he was born like 1949, so he's, he was like a child of the sixties and the seventies. So there's so much classic rock. I mean, not even classic rock, I would say more singer songwriters like James Taylor, Billy Joel, Elton John, you know? Right, right. So I think in that respect, I de that definitely influenced me as a writer. Huge. In a huge way. But then he does the jazz thing too. He's got like the old school Ella and Louis albums that he listens to a lot. And then like newer, newer recordings, anything that's extremely high deaf, he's, he's actually always looking for new music that's recorded really, really well. And Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, it's a, it's a strange thing to talk about with somebody who's never really had the experience, but honestly, it's less about the music as it is about the sounds. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Erin: </b>Right. Because he, he'll listen to a song over and over and over and over and over <laugh>. Right. Like Paul Simon. Yeah. So Grace <span style="color:red" data-ts="1111.125" data-end_ts="1111.405" title="1111.125" id=c_"1111.125">__Land__</span> is his reference song he uses when he is, tuning rooms. Okay. So, you know, he'll listen to it 15, 16 times over and it's really like the process of inserting a new amplifier and, you know, making sure the, just tweaking how the room sounds. Like that's what it, that's what it's about for him. It's not even about lyric, melody, harmony, anything. It's, it's all about sounds and frequencies and depth and warmth and width. It's, it's a totally different way of listening to music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. And yeah, that, that kind of concept of knowing something so well too, that it, it ends up being able to point out even like minor inconsistencies. That's probably really important in that kind of a gig, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Erin: </b>For better or for worse. Like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1156.605" data-end_ts="1156.725" title="1156.605" id=c_"1156.605">__it__</span> can make you crazy, but <laugh> Yeah. It's, you know, once you get it right, it's, you should see him. It's like, he'll, he gets really excited and I, I don't even like to start talking with it, talking to him about it. 'cause once you get started, you know, he's like, somebody will talk to me about the things that I'm interested in. Let's sit down and talk for hours. I'm like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1177.825" data-end_ts="1178.045" title="1177.825" id=c_"1177.825">__ugh__</span>. No, I know. The dog <span style="color:red" data-ts="1179.605" data-end_ts="1179.765" title="1179.605" id=c_"1179.605">__is__</span> Augustino Amp is so great. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Well, you know, it's funny because every once in a while I get, this like, wild urge. Oh, I'm, I'm gonna find out what these guys, so I'll go to a, like a Barnes and Noble or something and pick up like the absolute Sound magazine or something. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I'll get about halfway through and I'm like, oh my God, this is where the religious zealots of sound live. <laugh>. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Erin: </b>Yeah. It is like a culty thing for sure. Yeah. Lots of very expensive components, that's for sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Right. The other thing that you mentioned there, though, that I found interesting is that, is kind of this connection to some of the classic like vocalists and, and vocal songwriters. You know, I, it's, it's interesting to me because I feel like there are not as many, or we don't, we don't run across that as much in, in pop music anymore. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1232.865" data-end_ts="1233.085" title="1232.865" id=c_"1232.865">__It__</span>, it's almost like different, different parts of the music has, has come to the fore at the expense of songwriting in some cases. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Erin: </b>I mean, I guess you <span style="color:red" data-ts="1244.895" data-end_ts="1245.095" title="1244.895" id=c_"1244.895">__can__</span> mean that you could debate that either side. I think because, you know, sometimes there's many writers and like songs they take so long to sort of take form and lots of people get their hands on them. And, there was just this really interesting piece in New York Times about that song called The Middle. Right. Which had seven different producers, and they had like 14 different vocalists cut the song before they actually chose the one. So, you know, in a way, I think that recordings these days, there's, there's actually a lot more that goes into it just for better or worse, you know. And I think in a mainstream capacity, the typical writer, singer songwriter isn't as prevalent. Not to say that 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's a prominent, right. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Erin: </b>Yeah. It's, I mean, it's still there. You could definitely identify like Charlie PO or you know, like John Mayer's still out there doing something. Right, right. So it's, it's not like they're gone and just in the, in the mainstream, especially in a top 40 cents, you, you're not seeing a ton of that. But underneath the surface, there's a huge amount of people who are swimming in the middle that are, you know, not in this top tier of monetized recordings. And there's, there's so much happening. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="1322.965" data-end_ts="1323.085" title="1322.965" id=c_"1322.965">__then__</span> on the independent side that, you know, I'm, I'm encouraged, I'd say more than discouraged. Well, that's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1328.925" data-end_ts="1329.045" title="1328.925" id=c_"1328.925">__great__</span>. Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1329.485" data-end_ts="1329.645" title="1329.485" id=c_"1329.485">__But__</span>, but it is kind of sad, you know, like when you turn the radio on, you're like, what is going on? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>? Yeah. I hear you now. One of the things I I, I'm glad I get to talk to you because one of the things that Berkeley does that is, has always been really interesting and kind of amazing to me is they've made a course of study around songwriting that almost looks like, the technology of songwriting. I mean, there, there are many books that like break down structure or break down, song, narrative movement or whatever. I, I just, the other day I was at a, I was at a local, bookstore and I ran across a series of the Berkeley, books and songwriting. And I just love 'em because they, you know, it's like poetry, but with music <laugh>, you know, there's a very studied approach to breaking down songs into the influences that it came from, the structure that it, that it, it has and why that structure works with this kind of lyricism and stuff like that. It's really amazing. Is that the kind of thing that you studied when you were there? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Erin: </b>Yeah, definitely. I mean, the curriculum basically breaks down into four different elements. It's lyric, melody, harmony, rhythm. Right. And then the application of that. And there's, there's a concept that's the kind of the cornerstone of everything we do, which is called prosody, which basically just means like choosing the right musical tool to tell your story. Okay. So it's always connected back to like communicating some sort of a concept or emotion. And so when I was a writer, you know, I was focused on those main four tools as a writer. But post Berkeley, I decided I wanted to work with Sounds as well. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And that was, that was never a part of it. So now, you know, that's like my contribution to what we do with the department is the same idea. You know, it's like choosing the right musical tools to tell a story, but through these digital tools as well. So, you know, reverbs or audio effects, processing, virtual instruments, sequences, you know, it's, they're just more tools. But while I was there, yeah, it was definitely all just sort of, you know, nuts and bolts typical or what people would typically assume is what a songwriter's role is. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, from the time that you went there to now, the time that you're teaching, what have you seen that's changed significantly 
</p>

<p>
<b>Erin: </b>Inside of the department? It's, it's kind of interesting because not a lot <laugh> <laugh>, except for all the stuff that I'm doing. I mean, the reason I was hired is because they, they knew, they were kind of like staring down the barrel of the, the technology future, those hurtling towards them. So, you know, I was hired to update things. Sure. And, but you know, the, the core curriculum in terms of how we teach lyric writing, how we teach melody writing, like none of that's really changed. Okay. Maybe some of, some of the examples or the application of those, those ideas has changed as the sounds and industry is, you know, pivoting. But, you know, the, the tools are the same. It's, that's, that's what we say. We teach tools, not rules. So it's like, here's an idea, here's a progression, here's a contour. Like use it in whatever genre and apply it however, however you want to. So, I mean, in that respect, I'd say nothing has changed. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's actually interesting because, you know, in that time period, music has changed significantly, but it's interesting that at least from these kind of methodologies and the, and the concepts that those still remain valid despite the changes in music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Erin: </b>Yeah. I mean, I, I believe that to be true. I mean, like, I guess the, one of the big differences is that lots of people are top lining now, as opposed to 15 years ago when I was at the college, I was responsible for coming up with a harmonic progression playing the instrument. And now people are writing melodies and lyrics on top of tracks that producers have already created. I see. See, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. I, I didn't know what top lining was. So <laugh> Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Erin: </b>I mean, it's just basically melody and lyrics. Right. Got it. But the, the idea of how to write a melody hasn't changed. You know, maybe the application of how you actually, when you're doing it, how you're doing it is changing. But, you know, stepwise motion is stepwise motion. Like that didn't change in the past 10 years, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And now, within, within the framework too, one of the things that has changed, and it's actually been longer than that timeframe, but nevertheless, we'll just use it as, as kind of examples, there have been changes that, that seem like they would break, break the process of typical songwriting tools and, and uses things like, rapping and, MCing in, in hip hop genres, or complete lack of, you know, certainly lack of lyrics and oftentimes a lack of almost a discernible melody in a lot of EDM styles. How do the kind of classic songwriting concepts still match up when you have that significant of a change in the, in the core understanding or the core <span style="color:red" data-ts="1656.565" data-end_ts="1656.685" title="1656.565" id=c_"1656.565">__ion__</span> of music? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Erin: </b>Again, I think it's just a matter of application. So, you know, even if something has a significant amount of repetition or if the, the main, you know, spotlight is put on the rhythmic components of what's happening. Right. You know, the idea that like 10, like stable and unstable tension and release, and nobody wants to listen to music that does not develop at all. Right, right, right. It's just your ears become fatigued, nobody, because you will literally change the channel <laugh>. So even within, music, which is highly repetitive, let's say even like loop <span style="color:red" data-ts="1693.845" data-end_ts="1694.085" title="1693.845" id=c_"1693.845">__based__</span> EDM music or, hip hop music, which is, written over a loop, like there has to be some sort of interest in there. So it's all about rhythmic development. In that instance, if there's not a melodic, emphasis in that case, or variation within patterns, whether it's like automation or fills or variation like <span style="color:red" data-ts="1715.675" data-end_ts="1715.965" title="1715.675" id=c_"1715.675">__that__</span>, the idea that something has to develop and exposition of an idea of the development of that idea, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1721.665" data-end_ts="1721.885" title="1721.665" id=c_"1721.665">__the__</span> recap, recapitulation of those ideas, I mean, that's like classic Sonata formm. Right. And that's still, that's still the, the case with hip hop music. You know, it's like the idea that motifs are shown to you developed and then reone to you. That's still true. Even, even genres when repetition is like the, the main component. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Even if the delivery's different, that mechanism still remains the same. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Erin: </b>I, I believe that to be true. Yes. Sure, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Interesting. Now, I'm curious as a, as a teacher in this, when you see students come in and then you see students grow over time, what are the, what are the places where you see the most development? You know, this is painting with a broad brush, I realize, but I'm, I'm wondering, do you, do you find that, that people generally become deeper in their, in the kind of lyrics that they gravitate to do they find, do you find people generally moving to more complicated harmonic structures? Or what, what do you, is there any way to generalize how people grow in that kind of thing? Because oftentimes in academic academia, what you try and do is you try and say, okay, we're gonna grow you along this path. I'm just trying to wonder, I'm wondering, like within the Berkeley system, what does that path look like? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Erin: </b>Well, it's, I think, different for every single division and department. But, you know, once for our writers, once they hit a threshold of having taken, you know, certain prerequisites, then we allow them to sort of choose their own adventure. So, you know, we have one path that would lead them down a much more lyric centric destination. And we have another one that's more for people who want identify as singer songwriters who want to be performing and making a living as such, we have a path that's more for team writing. So again, like being involved as a, with a publishing, publishing company or a label and writing for other artists. And then we have a self-producing songwriter track as well. Okay. So it's like once they, once they get past a certain amount of curriculum, then we let, we let them decide, you know, how they identify. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Erin: </b>Because like you said, like some people are really gravitate towards the technology tools. Others are just about words. And, you know, we do this, well, I, in my, in my songwriting one classes, we do an exercise where, you know, I'll put four words on the board, lyric, melody, harmony, rhythm, and then I, I have people put down what they think is the most important out of all four of those things at the top of the page. Okay. And then at the bottom of the page, they have to choose what's least important. And it's, it's a very difficult question to ask because they're, you know, they're all very important. It's not like, you know, we're gonna get rid of one someday. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1896.205" data-end_ts="1896.425" title="1896.205" id=c_"1896.205">__The__</span>, I think <span style="color:red" data-ts="1896.825" data-end_ts="1897.225" title="1896.825" id=c_"1896.825">__they're__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1897.225" data-end_ts="1897.425" title="1897.225" id=c_"1897.225">__there__</span>, everybody's perception of is so varied. You know, some people are all about lyrics. Other people are all about harmony. And some people don't care about lyrics at all. Right. So the only reoccurring theme in, and then I've asked this question to hundreds and hundreds of students at this point, is that nobody thinks melody is the least important. That's it. <laugh>, that's, that is the only thing that we can say for certain <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's, that's actually really interesting. Mm-Hmm, <affirmative>, that's really interesting. Especially because most people kind of think of like the loop slash groove oriented stuff as kind of eliminating the necessity of, of melody. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Erin: </b>Well, I mean, rhythms are pitches, right? Right. It's just like, eventually, if, if <span style="color:red" data-ts="1944.185" data-end_ts="1944.305" title="1944.185" id=c_"1944.185">__a__</span>, a rhythmic or a cycle gets played fast enough in secession, it becomes a pitch. So, you know, I, I think that even, even if there's not pitch in a traditional sense, there, there absolutely is some sort of a contour. I mean, there's a rhythm and a melody to the way that we're speaking to each other right now. It's like, whether or not, you know, it's there, melody exists in, in every, every sense, every context. And I think that it's very, it's, it's a substantial part of hip hop and rap, just maybe not in the traditional context. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Yeah, that's, that's a great point. And it's one of those things where you have to, you have to just look at it from a different direction to see that, see those same things occurring. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Erin: </b>I think about this stuff all the time. I don't usually get a chance to like dive deep into the philosophical ideas about rhythms and melodies. Oh. But 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>This is kind of cool because it's like, it's kind of neat to be able to geek out about something that doesn't have a fuse sticking out of the back. But it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2001.565" data-end_ts="2001.765" title="2001.565" id=c_"2001.565">__why__</span>, it's one of the reasons I was excited to get to talk to you, because again, with like this idea of approaching songwriting and song development in almost a technical, from almost a technical perspective, is something that somehow simultaneously speaks to the, creative and the scientific, or over intellectual parts of my brain simultaneously, which is really powerful. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Erin: </b>I agree. Yeah. It's, when I'm, when I get into my flow, uhhuh <affirmative>, when I'm being creative inside of a DAW, it's like, it's like I almost black out because my brain is working so hard on both sides that I, I, it's almost like a meditation of sorts. Like, I become, my brain becomes so active that I'm actually unable to think regular thoughts. Right. Which plague, plague my every day, you know, <laugh>, I think I think about shit all day long once I stop. It's, it feels fantastic. So, you know, I think that's really why I love creating this, in this sense right 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, given that you kind of have, you, you have this, this thing where part of your, practice is like doing, doing freelance work with like people doing hardware and software. I'm curious, and, and also that music tech is part of your teaching practice. What is, what for you represents the point at which tech, the technology becomes kind of important for its own, for its own sake? And how do you prevent that from like messing with your ability to still do creative work? For me, a lot of times the second that I start embracing the technology, my creative mind slam shut, and now I'm, I am in, you know, screwdriver <span style="color:red" data-ts="2114.085" data-end_ts="2114.245" title="2114.085" id=c_"2114.085">__and__</span> soldering iron mode. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Erin: </b>So I believe that like everything reveals itself in its own time. Right. So I, I don't believe that, you know, this week we're gonna talk about the MIDI <span style="color:red" data-ts="2128.805" data-end_ts="2129.095" title="2128.805" id=c_"2128.805">__spec__</span>, right? Like, this is a hugely important thing to understand, especially if you wanna do certain type of work. Right. But the midi <span style="color:red" data-ts="2136.735" data-end_ts="2136.895" title="2136.735" id=c_"2136.735">__spec__</span> works without us having to understand it. Right. So I, I sort of allow my students to stumble into these, these concepts. Like I'm trying to get my device to sort of listen to me in one context and then not in another, but then be able to do this on another track. You know, it's like they're trying, they're, they're describing a creative thing that, or a vision they have of something that they want to accomplish, but they don't yet understand the mechanism behind any of these devices or how it works. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Erin: </b>And so it's like, in that sense, when somebody is creatively invested in how something might work, then we start talking about being really technical. And I'm like, well, let's talk about how the MIDI protocol works. This is the, this is the messages, this is how they get set, this is what CCS are. You know, and then they're just like, minds are blown, you know, like, I've been doing this, this wrong the whole time and <laugh> and, but then the technical process becomes creative because it's like, okay, there's, you know, x number of ways to get to this destination. I could put things on multiple tracks. I could have separate virtual instruments. I can group them all into a multi <span style="color:red" data-ts="2205.225" data-end_ts="2205.445" title="2205.225" id=c_"2205.225">__tam__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2205.445" data-end_ts="2205.685" title="2205.445" id=c_"2205.445">__role__</span> situation. You know, so then all of a sudden the technical task becomes, creative one. It's like, how are you going to accomplish your vision using a technical tool? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Erin: </b>So actually I get, I get a lot of pushback, from a lot of my peers at the college, because, you know, for them it's all about foundation. Like, let's teach them what gets sent on. You know, channel 126 <laugh>. It's like, I don't care. Right? Right. I don't care about that. Or, you know, same thing with compressors. Like, we'll be in class and we'll be listening and someone will say, you know, I'm missing half a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2246.085" data-end_ts="2246.205" title="2246.085" id=c_"2246.085">__year__</span> words, you know, and then, then, then they need a compressor. And then I talk about how compression works and, and why they need compression. And you know, I'd say nine times <span style="color:red" data-ts="2255.705" data-end_ts="2255.925" title="2255.705" id=c_"2255.705">__out__</span> of 10, the, the, the journey unfolds in exactly the same way. Just it's, it's non-linear. Right, right. For everybody. And that's what, that's how creativity manifests itself. That's how composition manifests itself. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Erin: </b>And I truly think that that's how learning technology in the right way is also non-linear. Because if it's like step one, step two, step three, that is, that shit's boring. And I'm not interested in that. So, you know, for me, I, I don't think that it's so far fetched to teach in the same sense. And then my students, you know, walk away knowing, knowing things very deeply and in a way that makes sense about how it applies to them. Whereas if it was another course where it's like, this is accelerated pro tools, you know, they might not, they might know which, where the different, you know, pull down menus where you can find the MIDI editor. Like why. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. Because you're maintaining kind of this experiential connection throughout the whole thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Erin: </b>Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. Well, and also what you're doing by doing that is making it so that there isn't a clear delineation between technology time and creative time, which is probably setting them up for a pretty good, pretty good run. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Erin: </b>I think so. I mean, there's another colleague at the college, his name's Enrique Gonzalez Mueller, and he, we have the same sort of concept. Like he's a, he's a diehard pro tools user, very engineer centric person. And you know, we're talking about EQing kick drums. And so people are like, I wanna know how to do it. You know, or like, give me, give me a rule. Right? And then he'll say, okay, you know, I could teach you how to, I could teach you how to EQ a kick drum. But the question really is like, why, why are you EQing it? What's wrong with it? And so like those underlying questions about why you're using this technology and for what purpose, I think that's really the core of why somebody would ever learn anything. And if you don't give them a reason why, then they're not actually learning it ever. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. So now one thing you said though is that you do, you do a lot of curriculum for Berkeley online. It sounds like you have a very dynamic teaching style in the classroom. How does that translate to online learning? I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Erin: </b>Mean, it's largely the same. I've, I've actually done equivalent courses that exist on, in the brick and mortar campus for the online school. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know, it's the same. We, it's the same. We do a lot of video content and, you know, you do have to create some sort of a framework, but it's like, somebody gave me this analogy to raising children, right? Like, if you wanna raise them, right, you have to give them a, a frame. Like here's where the, here's where the rules are, and then everything in inside of it, you are free to do whatever it is that you want. And then they grow up knowing that like, life has limitations, but that they are largely in control of their destinies <laugh>, right? So it's the same thing with the online learning. It's like you create a framework and then within that you encourage creativity, you encourage questions, and you make sure that, you know, you leave some, you leave questions to be asked. They can't, you can't have every single piece of information. And even with online learning, there's, there's a, you know, a person <span style="color:red" data-ts="2458.365" data-end_ts="2458.585" title="2458.365" id=c_"2458.365">__to__</span> person engagement. It's just digital. So, you know, it's again, just a, like a rigid frame. And then inside of, inside of that, they get to be as creative as they can be. And I encourage that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure, sure. Well, I just looked at the clock and I realized that our time is almost already up. My god, that went fast. Before I let you go though, I am, curious, what does, what's next for you? I mean, it seems like you have a full shopping cart already, but, as we know, Russ never sleeps, and so we all have to be pushing for the next thing. What are, what are you pushing yourself in? What's the area of self-knowledge that you're pushing yourself into and learning more about for yourself? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Erin: </b>You know, I think, so I've been thinking about this a lot and I, I sort of feel like I'm at a precipice where I wanna do something different. And I don't know exactly what that is. You know, I don't see myself teaching forever. I think I'll probably do another five years, so I'll, I'll do a decade of this. So I feel like I've said everything I have to say that I've made the impact that I can and walk away feeling really good about it. And then in the meantime, you know, just getting involved in projects that I find to be exciting, but more, more often than not, what seems to be excitingly are projects which have some sort of entrepreneurial, element to them. And I've actually worked, there's an institute at the college called the Institute for Creative Entrepreneurism, and I have sort of just like fallen into doing this. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Erin: </b>So the idea of like taking and building projects of my own and seeing them to fruition as in terms of the project management and the execution, whereas, you know, when I'm typically freelancing, I'm working for another person, you know, it's like create content for said, developer manufacturer, do product demo at <span style="color:red" data-ts="2583.975" data-end_ts="2584.195" title="2583.975" id=c_"2583.975">__now__</span>. You know, like, I'm always working for other people, right. And so I think in the future, I'd, I'd really like to be the person that's like generating the ideas and generating the work. So, you know, and I am doing that with Beats By Girls is a good example of this happening. You know, but with Great Power becomes great responsibility, <laugh>, <laugh>, and, you know, I'm, I'm working towards that. I, I just had a baby and I, I have the intention of having another at some point in time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Erin: </b>So right now I'm just focusing on continuing to do the best possible job that I can in all of these elements and all these projects so that when I know exactly what my next move is, I'll be able to make it in a heartbeat. And that, you know, whatever questions I'm asking, whatever requests I'm putting in, the answer's gonna be yes. So I guess the answer is, I don't know what's happening. I don't know where I'm headed or what I'm learning, but I've got my eyes wide open and I know something else is coming my way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Wow. Sounds fantastic. Sounds like an exciting future for sure. Well, Aaron, I want to thank you so much for, spending the time talking about this <span style="color:red" data-ts="2655.305" data-end_ts="2655.595" title="2655.305" id=c_"2655.305">__talk__</span>, kind of like letting me go kind of free range on songwriting and technology, but it was, really educational for me and really interesting to talk to you about it. Thank you so much. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Erin: </b>You're so welcome. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And with that, I'll let you have the rest of your day. Thank you so much, and have a good one. You too. Bye 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nobody: </b><i>Bye. </i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Many thanks to Erin for having this chat with us. It was really great to check in, find out what she's been up to at Berkeley when, what she's been up to in her personal life. And especially working with the, beats for Girls is really <span style="color:red" data-ts="2691.405" data-end_ts="2691.525" title="2691.405" id=c_"2691.405">__a__</span> interesting and exciting, avenue for her to be pursuing. I wanna thank, recording Magazine again for, helping facilitate these podcasts. I want to thank Ben Casey in this case for opening the door to meet Aaron. And I wanna thank you, the listeners for being involved for all of the email that I've been getting lately. It's been really great to get that. And then again, just a reminder, we're putting a little push here in May to actually poke YouTube in the eye a little bit. So if you can go over to YouTube, figure out where it is that they are, posting these things to just do a search for Art Plus Music plus Technology, or for Aaron <span style="color:red" data-ts="2734.725" data-end_ts="2734.925" title="2734.725" id=c_"2734.725">__Berra__</span> or whomever, find us, like it or subscribe to it or something. Let's find a way to make Google say, Hey, these people do exist. We're getting huge numbers right now in terms of downloads. I'd just like to make it so that we, this gets surfaced for more people, get more people the opportunity to hear what's going on. So with that, I'm gonna leave you. Go Happy Mother's Day to all the mother's out there. And happy Sunday for everyone else. We'll talk to you later. Bye.
