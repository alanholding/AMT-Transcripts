<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. This week we have a very special guest, Brian Crabtree who is the, one of the two people behind <span style="color:red" data-ts="23" data-end_ts="23.35" title="23" id=c_"23">__Manum__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="24.24" data-end_ts="25.15" title="24.24" id=c_"24.24">__manum.org__</span>. Is going to be chatting with me. Now, I have to admit, I have a, quite a history with, with Brian. He and I worked around some of the same crazies early in his career and <laugh>. I was also lucky enough to, for one, one day for Brian to have come up to me and said, Hey, Darwin I have to show you what I'm working on. And he showed me a button and I was like, cool, a button. He was like, no, no. You don't understand the, the light behind the button is decoupled from the button itself. And I was like, yeah, good for you, man. Cause I in no way imagined the, the importance and the future that that little button implied. So, with that, let's say hi to Brian. Hi, Brian. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian Crabtree: </b>Hey, Darwin How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm all right. So, my memory, my memories of you are, are pretty much hiding behind a hoodie most of the time. And then this button story, which was, you know, I look back on with quite, quite a pile of chagrin. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Yeah, yeah. And, and I, I love just how, how totally positive your podcast has been from the, from the start. Cuz you had a real opportunity for, some shit talking with that last job you were mentioning. <laugh> <laugh>. But I, oh, but I wanted to point out that, that Mono is, now three of us. It's also our good friend Trent Gill, who we imported from Australia. And he, he was a monomer from the beginning who, became a, became a close friend. So he's now living in Brooklyn and, working, you know, working closely with us too to make things happen and kind of keep all of us on track. And, so yeah, we're very happy to have him as well. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I didn't, I didn't realize that you had actually pulled him into the country. That's great. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, the working with, the United States government to, import workers is, it seems a little daunting, but it's doable. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that's cool. Fantastic. So, let's kick it off by first of all, talking a little bit, about, what <span style="color:red" data-ts="156.26" data-end_ts="156.55" title="156.26" id=c_"156.26">__mono__</span>, has been up to recently. You guys just came out with a module, kind of on the heels of having done the, the aif, which was, is that, did I pronounce that right? I never, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>We <span style="color:red" data-ts="171.97" data-end_ts="172.19" title="171.97" id=c_"171.97">__put__</span> history. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What do you, how do you pronounce it? <span style="color:red" data-ts="173.67" data-end_ts="174.03" title="173.67" id=c_"173.67">__Because__</span> in fact, this seems to be one of the things around your whole business is making names that nobody is sure they're pronouncing correctly. <laugh>. I think ARC is the only thing everyone has a handle on. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Yeah. It's, it's the minor discomfort that makes them so attractive. <laugh>, I, I pronounce it oli, and that's kind of what we've always said, and I think Oli like within, like really an <span style="color:red" data-ts="196.12" data-end_ts="196.34" title="196.12" id=c_"196.12">__it__</span> is, is proper. But, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="199.3" data-end_ts="199.7" title="199.3" id=c_"199.3">__pronoun__</span> I preferred the, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="201.38" data-end_ts="201.5" title="201.38" id=c_"201.38">__e__</span> and, but I think after the, you know, after we started calling it mono on the, and then we realized the internet had, you know, 20 different other ways that they wanted to say it internationally. We were just, you got embraced them all and it's pretty fitting with also how people decide to use, use this stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well that's, that's certainly true. Yeah. Yeah. So recently you, you started, you did a module, called the white Whale. I'm gonna assume it wasn't Wally, right? <laugh> <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>We were, yeah, well, yeah, the Moby Dick, not the Wally, right. <laugh> <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Why don't you tell people a little bit about what that is? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>We've, we've been doing kind of these open-ended, open source kind of devices and controllers for making, making music with this kind of idea that it should be shaped by the artist. So the tool is kind of as minimal and abstract as possible, and it's, it's really just capable of being transformed into whatever you can possibly imagine. <span style="color:red" data-ts="271.96" data-end_ts="272.18" title="271.96" id=c_"271.96">__And__</span> in, in my exp or part of what my goal was always like, the more transformable it is, kind of the, the more exciting it is to me. But with this recent thing, the, the white whale is a eurorack module. So it fits into, you know, this, this paradigm of, you know, having, mixing and matching a bunch of different functionality from different manufacturers. And they all speak this common language of triggers, triggers and control voltage. And, you know, of course the first thought was like, we, well, we should just make some open-ended thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>That can be whatever, whatever, people imagine. But then I think after the oli, which was that, we realized that we actually need to be trying to develop instruments that people can approach, you know, very directly. And I need to start thinking more about like, how do you actually make music and not just, you know, fixate on creating tools to make music. So the, I I think this was the really my big first effort to, you know, make a, make a workable instrument. So it, the, the, module fits into the context of the other, the kind of URAC ecosystem, but introduces this ability to plug in a mono grid, you know, via USB into the front. And this was exciting to me cuz it, you know, can potentially introduce gesture and this kind of deep data and these layers that typically can't, that typically aren't accessed on, kind of like a eurorack setup. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Which is one of the beauties of urac though that makes it so kind of exciting, is that the simplicity and the kind of one-to-one nature of most, like the, you know, you have a knob, it does something, if you have a jack, it kind of does something <laugh>. And so it's right, it becomes kind of clear memorizable. But, what was exciting to me about the grid very early on was that I could have this surface, you mentioned the decoupled nature. So something visually can be represented on this grid that doesn't necessarily directly correspond to what you are, to what you're pressing. So the, the interaction is determined by the computer, the program that's, you know, plugged in by U usb. So having that same sort of flexibility with the UAC is what we <span style="color:red" data-ts="413.06" data-end_ts="413.18" title="413.06" id=c_"413.06">__are__</span> going for. So the first thing, this white whale is a step sequencer, and that sounds boring, but we've been making step sequencers for about a decade now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>And, and we, we include the whole world and the world of mono users, you know, internationally who have been kind of, you know, mutating these maxim s p patches and putting them back up. And, the grid is very well suited for <span style="color:red" data-ts="438.71" data-end_ts="439.06" title="438.71" id=c_"438.71">__steps__</span> sequencers because of the data and, the data that can be displayed. And the fact that you can use, you know, all 10 fingers to kind of rapidly change, change the data that's happening. So there's a focus on the kind of live performance element of it, but also the, the just being able to try lots of ideas really, really quickly. And, I feel like that had a big, big influence on, you know, how I thought about making music, but also incorporating a lot of ideas of, you know, just indeterminacy and, and randomness and probabilities and really looking for this, this emergent quality where, where you can set up a, a bunch of rules and then, you know, kind of pre compose a framework and get somewhat unexpected results and trying to steer, trying to steer this thing that's kind of behaving, you know, slightly not totally under your control, but you can kind of take, take some, take some degree of aesthetic ownership of the machine, even though I'm very, terrified of this idea of pure randomness. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>And, you know, kind of what, what that means for having the artist voice in there still. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I think it's actually kind of interesting too that yours, that this white whale is actually one of the first instances, outside the range of like, you know, midi interfaces, the first <span style="color:red" data-ts="530.74" data-end_ts="531.18" title="530.74" id=c_"530.74">__instances__</span> where, the smarts are in the modular, but the interface is external. And I actually think that that's pretty smart, especially for people like myself who want to have either relatively or highly portable machines. It means that you don't have to, you don't have to use a lot of panel space for your user interface on what, <span style="color:red" data-ts="554.92" data-end_ts="555.14" title="554.92" id=c_"554.92">__but__</span> you know, certainly from the, from the videos I've seen what, what appears to be a, a fairly complex sequencing system. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Sure. And, and also since the, the kind of user interface panel is the grid, you can, it can be pulled away from the, the spaghetti nest. And so you're not trying to navigate inside of <span style="color:red" data-ts="576.7" data-end_ts="576.82" title="576.7" id=c_"576.7">__a__</span>, in, inside of a maze that's kind of visually obscured. Right. And, and yeah, <span style="color:red" data-ts="583.26" data-end_ts="583.46" title="583.26" id=c_"583.26">__what__</span> you say, the, the, the whole, tremendous amount of functionality <span style="color:red" data-ts="587.17" data-end_ts="587.46" title="587.17" id=c_"587.17">__fits__</span> in, fits into, like six hp and what's, but what's really most exciting about this to me is going back to having a transformable surface, is this, this prospect of having several, several different modules, all that can speak to the grid and then kind of continue operating on their own while, while you're hot swapping the USB cable in between several different ones. So one, one way that that users, mono users, on the computer will typically be running three or four applications at the same time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>And just like, you know, mouse focusing between a bunch of windows, you know, people will have hot keys to, you know, swap applications. But, you know, in the modular environment, there's, you know, there's this, it follows this analogy where you're, where you're patching a cable into different places, and, but this, you know, this really works seamlessly to patch a USB cable back and forth between different modules. And then you're, you're suddenly looking at the data from, from a totally different application. So we have a, we have a, a couple more that we're, just finishing up right now. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, I was gonna, I was gonna ask, because you're kinda laying some breadcrumbs there that make that kind of clear. What kind of things do you, do you mind telling us a little bit about what, what might be around the corner? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Yeah, yeah, a little bit. We've, I've, I've gotten, you know, this is the, this is the longest we'd ever been able to keep a secret before this whale thing, <laugh>, you know, you know, typically, you know, even, you know, even the olive, we worked on the olive for a long time, but, you know, Kelly gets Kelly's like at the kitchen table helping, helping build this stuff. And she's like holding her phone, like, just like waiting to take the picture and post it somewhere, right? And just like, gets so excited about this. But, we managed to, you know, do the whole, do the whole well development in, you know, about, it was really only about three, three and a half months, four months that we decided we needed to make something new quick to, to kind of keep going with everything. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>And, and I, I feel like it was really, really a helpful headspace to be in, to be developing something that had, that had fixed functionality that was, that was really going to be, you know, manifest an idea, with, without having to also be, kind of negotiating everything else that comes with, kind of building this, this hype machine. And also, and also, you know, you get to put the object in people's hands, like right when they find out about it, which was really powerful compared to the, you know, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="747.38" data-end_ts="747.54" title="747.38" id=c_"747.38">__LF__</span> did have, a numerous manufacturing hangups that were totally beyond our control. And it's just, it's, it's incredibly disappointing to be the perpetual bearer of, bad news that someone's gonna have to wait. But anyway, so yeah, we do have, I this the next, we're doing a series of modules. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>This one that's coming out should be ready by the end of the month. And, it's, it's basically a hardware manifestation of the, the metaphysics, which is a, it's a, it's an olive operator and it's a max patch. It's gotten a little bit of attention, but I, I don't think that it's been, kind of widely recognized for the potential. It's a, it's a complex cascading counter is the, complicated language I've been using for it. But it's, it's really, it follows this sort of tradition of, of having multiple, multiple rows that can be counted down. And then, and then, it creates a variety of, of polyrhythms in the way that you can set how long it takes for these to count down. Sure. Sort of like, the historical max patches are, like the Flynn and the <span style="color:red" data-ts="820.72" data-end_ts="821.14" title="820.72" id=c_"820.72">__Boeing__</span>, and, I think there are several others that kind of like follow this idea of just being able to make simple poly rhythms. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>But this, but metaphysics in addition, has <span style="color:red" data-ts="830.38" data-end_ts="830.5" title="830.38" id=c_"830.38">__a__</span>, the ability to kind of cross influence each row as a row is counting down. When it hits the bottom, it can tell, you can route it to count down other rows. And so it can be tangled in such a way that these emergent behaviors will, will start to come out to where you'll get polyrhythms. But then you'll get these long, long form shifting polyrhythms that'll happen over time. And then, of course, it sounds complicated, but it's actually, it ends pretty much here. Is that, then on top of this, there's a whole, there's a whole set of rules that can be applied to each row, and it hits the bottom so that they can re randomize its position or increase by one or tell another row to set a different position. And so after, after a while you can make these, these neat little machines that, that generate these, kind of idiosyncratic rhythms that these triggers can then be mapped to, you know, pitches or drum hits or the, the beauty of modular is that the, <span style="color:red" data-ts="883.84" data-end_ts="884.06" title="883.84" id=c_"883.84">__the__</span>, the data is, totally neutral and it can be, can be anything and everything. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>So I'm, I'm really excited to see this in the modular platform. Cause it's been, it's been a lot of fun for, for me on the computer and on the all if it's amazing, to have that running without, without anything. But, it, it helped me kind of make some full pieces that I just felt like I didn't even want to add anything to, cuz it's, it's, remarkable when you stumble upon these kind of magical combinations of, of, data and rules and what that can produce. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, you recently put out like two different releases. One on 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>One is, one is Detroit Underground. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, Detroit Underground. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Yeah. That's, that's run by, carro who, from back from Reflex. And then, the other one is a Frank Rose is a longtime, mono mono community organizer that, started, started a little kind of online, online presence. Kelly and I both decided to commit to making some music for him. You know, I, I haven't made music kind of in this <span style="color:red" data-ts="947.94" data-end_ts="948.06" title="947.94" id=c_"947.94">__c__</span> committed album form for like literally a decade. Prob since I started, since we started Mono as a, as a business. It really <laugh> it's, it's kind of, inversely proportional to how much, creative energy comes out musically. So, so I've been, you know, playing live and, making little recordings here or there, but, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, you got, you got my money on those recordings. I thought they were, were beautiful. And so, but it's, it's definitely the kind of music that I really enjoy listening to, just as I am, you know, and I think this is, this kind of goes back to, to your aesthetic in general. You tend to do things that, are, are usable and interesting to me, while also being aspirational. I mean, there's, there's something about your recordings, there's something about your devices that makes me, even if I'm not using them, I want to try and find a way to use them, right? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, or if I'm not listening to it, I wanna put myself in a position where that might be what I wanna listen to. It's kind of, it's kind of odd, but, you know, it's, so it's, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>It's that's fantastically kind. Thank you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, yeah, it's, I mean, the thing is I'm trying to say is that you're not being something as crass as like a taste maker or something like that, right? And I'm sure that's the last moniker you'd want hung on your head anyway. But what it does seem is that, is that this, the aesthetic that you bring is something that a lot of people find attractive and, desirable when they're thinking about their artistic lives, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Yeah. And, and, it's, it's interesting to me because I, well, well, you mentioned this, this is, I mean, these, these interviews really give people an insight into, you know, the lives of the people that you're interviewing. But, you know, Kelly and I are largely very private people. I mean, we live out in the middle of nowhere, right? And, and, you know, the sort of assumptions about what our lifestyle are, are, are really just, you know, they're stories at this point, <laugh>. So <span style="color:red" data-ts="1079.78" data-end_ts="1079.9" title="1079.78" id=c_"1079.78">__I__</span>, so I really like the idea that this, this sort of aspiration and inspiration can be infused into, into, you know, the object or the recordings. But <span style="color:red" data-ts="1091.1" data-end_ts="1091.22" title="1091.1" id=c_"1091.1">__I__</span>, what's, I think what's most, it's, but it's less about me and more I think about, just, just minimalism and what I, what I kind of identify both in the devices and, you know, their potentiality. And, and also, you know, minimalism in music, just giving, giving the listener the, this space to kind of in interpret and kind of fill in, fill in, you know, the interstitial spaces and, you know, allow your brain to kind of exist and not be terrifically overstimulated in a certain way. Mm-hmm. So it, it kind of leaves the idea of leaving, leaving room for the user and the listener and the person experiencing it. Does that make sense? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's exactly what I was going to kind of pitch in, was that it, it seems like in almost everything you do, whether it's the machines you build or the music you create, or even, you know, I've, I've read a number of the interviews you've done on online that are posted online and stuff, or your interactions with the community without seeming to obsess about it. You seem to always leave room for the person at the other end of the wire to do the thing that they, they need to do, which is, you know, and if you consider that sort of a part of minimalism, well, I think, there's a lot of people that really identify with that kind of minimalism. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Well, it's, well, minimalism may, maybe that's like actually a, a terrible word to to say. Cause it's very, it's, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's pretty loaded. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>It's, yeah, it's loaded and it's, it's controversial, but, I think it's may maybe openness makes, makes more sense. Sure. And, and, you know, Kelly and I spend a lot of time talking about language, and it's, it's very tricky to get a precise meaning across, and particularly when my personal writing style has to do with, ooh, kind of like spilling a whole ton of stuff out and then, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1213.64" data-end_ts="1213.86" title="1213.64" id=c_"1213.64">__and__</span> then kind of just cutting it back and back and back until it's very small and it means almost nothing in every single word is super loaded, so you have to read it a hundred times to glean any means. So I'm, I'm really the worst kind of marketing, self-promotion engine to could ever really exist. And so we, we really just rely on hopefully people that identify with, with the ideas or with the, you know, with the aesthetic that we're trying to create. Or, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You are sort of like the ee Cummings of, the media art world. I'll say that 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b><laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I don't think I've ever seen you use a capital letter, which is the opposite of marketing world, right? So, oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>You wouldn't believe this, but, you know, now, so we shifted to using retailers, but, I've, I've realized that I just feel like I'm being more legitimate if I write to, even though I know these people, you know, like, you know, Jason Kramer like in, in Portland <span style="color:red" data-ts="1276.72" data-end_ts="1276.94" title="1276.72" id=c_"1276.72">__is__</span> like, I know you, but now we have a business relationship, right? I should use capitals. I'm gonna, I'm still not, I'm still not wearing any shoes and I'm in my barn, but I'm gonna pretend. So <laugh> <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That's hilarious. So, given kind of the aesthetic you, you bring as well as your vision for a particular kind of performance and a particular kind of artwork, I am really curious about what is the background that, that you bring to this? I you say you've listened to <span style="color:red" data-ts="1308.58" data-end_ts="1308.78" title="1308.58" id=c_"1308.58">__the__</span>, to the podcast, you know, full well, that I like diving into what made people, the artists they've become. Yeah, I'd like to know what your background is. I'm really curious. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Yeah. Strangely enough, I, I think like, as a kid, when I first discovered synthesizers, I thought like, it would be cool to work for Roland or something one day I should make synthesizers. And so it's really horrifying that I actually ended up here. And, but, I started off playing piano as a kid, you know, stuck with it, stuck with it for a while, was, was interested in writing things myself. But, you know, once, once you get into middle school, they, you know, mandate that you play a wind instrument. So I then did, did that in around the same time, started getting into computer. I was born in 1980, so computers were actually starting to, you know, get available by the time I was, you know, in, in middle school. So that, that kind of simultaneously got me interested in like, what can you do with digital things, you know, while also, you know, splitting that time with this skateboarding and playing role playing games and things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Sure, sure. So early on in the computer days, my parents, you know, saw the, the potential of the computer with music and went in, got an old like Roland Midi sound canvas, and a really cheap MIDI controller. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="1394.75" data-end_ts="1394.87" title="1394.75" id=c_"1394.75">__I__</span> think it was, you know, windows 3.1 and Master Tracks Pro. And that just totally, I don't know that there was such an amazing thing to be able to sequence things. And suddenly my whole, my whole world was, you know, making these little, little songs. And it took me a very, very long time to identify an aesthetic, if that makes sense. Right. It's like when you, I feel like when you're young, hearing so much different music and kind of emulating everything. So I was, yeah, I had some older uncles, you know, that exposed me to like, industrial and new waves and you know, but also I found I somehow like found Yani and Enya, like completely captivating <laugh>, so Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>I was going back and forth between, you know, making things that sounded like video games and then, you know, making things that could definitely be, you know, played at a, at a health spa. And, there was a, there was a kind of formative moment that happened when, I was in high school and entered a, entered a, like, composition contest. It was this, you know, song that I wrote with a, with like a chord music workstation. And, you know, they, you know, I won at some level, like locally. And so they invited me to come perform the song. And of course, you know, most people they're writing music back then. If you were that young, you were probably a piano student and you'd written something, you know, nice. And, but I showed up with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1487.78" data-end_ts="1487.9" title="1487.78" id=c_"1487.78">__his__</span> keyboard and I was like, I guess I have to perform this. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>And of course I just sat up on stage and then just pushed play on the sequencer, <laugh> <laugh>. And, you know, I was like 16. And like, and it didn't dawn on me that that was going to be awkward until it was about, you know, 10 seconds into it when I didn't <span style="color:red" data-ts="1505.54" data-end_ts="1505.66" title="1505.54" id=c_"1505.54">__real__</span>, I realized I was on <span style="color:red" data-ts="1506.7" data-end_ts="1506.82" title="1506.7" id=c_"1506.7">__a__</span> stage and had nothing to do at all. Right. So, I, I kind of just like ghost played some of the keys here and then, and then kind of like looked up and then, you know, decided that didn't work and, you know, it was a kind of grueling five minutes and got down and realized that there was a, a little bit of problem solving that had to happen. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's kinda interesting that you, you went through that process where most people are actually like in a bar when they go, when they first encounter the fact that, what they're doing with their computer and synthesizer is not engaging to an audience. So maybe congratulations for you for having a better venue for that 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b><laugh>. I've, I've ex I've experienced that too, don't worry. So I was still, I was still using a lot of computers and making music in, in high school, decided to kind of shift, went to uc, San Diego to study electrical engineering cuz it just seemed different. But, you know, really, really quickly I realized it was a lot of differential equations, which was, you know, not, not hard, but didn't seem terrifically like it had any application to anything substantial. Right. So I shifted to the computing and the arts program, which is where I met, you know, Peter Otto and Miller Puckett and, you know, a lot of fantastic faculty. And, you know, MaxMSP was one of the first classes that I took <span style="color:red" data-ts="1593.9" data-end_ts="1594.1" title="1593.9" id=c_"1593.9">__and__</span>, you know, since I already knew how to program and see, I already kind of understood how <span style="color:red" data-ts="1599.06" data-end_ts="1599.34" title="1599.06" id=c_"1599.06">__data__</span> worked. And I've basically just, you know, stayed up for three months every night at the, computer music lab, you know, just learning Max all the way through and through, I think this is max three or something, somewhere like two and a half, like right before MSP or something. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Oh, sure. But that, that just really transformed, that really transformed everything. I had been, I had been, trying to perform electronic music again with a friend, Peter Segerstrom, who now goes by portable sunsets. He makes, he makes terrific techno. But we, we kind of started experimenting with performing, you know, live electronic music. And we just kind of ended up bringing our entire studios to the gig every single time, which was, was ridiculous. It was that all these, all these samplers and synthesizers and, and just trying to make them kind of like talk in a way that would allow us to make, to make music for an hour or so. So after, after discovering Max realized that we could, you know, potentially build these, you know, monolithic performance machines that would let us do, they let us kind of make music in ways that, you know, we had, we had envisioned that were outside the boundaries of how the, you know, designers of these, you know, commercial music making objects had kind of decided. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>And, you know, it worked for a while. It was, it was difficult to make music for more than half an hour with these, with these funny sets of max patches, but primarily because, yeah, we were just clicking the mouse a whole bunch. Right. And, typing on the keyboard. So this is where, this is where <span style="color:red" data-ts="1700.42" data-end_ts="1700.5" title="1700.42" id=c_"1700.42">__I__</span> realized that like a grid surface or something, you could actually touch like a drum machine. But then, but then I think the breakthrough was realizing that the interface needed to change and the way that to do that would be if it was back lit and then secondarily that they had to be decoupled so it could run our several different patches at once. Yeah, this idea stuck with me for like, for a whole year, and then I ended up, going to going to, Cal Arts to do grad school in their, in their composition department. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Which I had gotten a, a, introduction to <span style="color:red" data-ts="1737.54" data-end_ts="1737.74" title="1737.54" id=c_"1737.54">__Martin__</span> Nik through working for Peter Otto and doing a lot of specialized audio. So I, so I was making max patches as a kind of artist assistance, and then in the meantime, trying to work on this grid interface and that it kind of became the focus of my, all of my work in grad school. And after the first prototype was working at the end of, at the end of the first year, I just started performing with it all over Los Angeles. And, it was amazing how, I don't even think anybody really heard the music was the thing is that the, the, the kind of light display and the sort of like, all of the gesture that was involved, that was, that was, you know, generating these sounds was like so, so captivating that luckily I think people were pretty forgiving with, you know, potentially how, how kind of sloppy I was being. But, it's, there were really interesting days because the device really overshadowed kind of everything else. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, sure. But I mean it in a way, and, and this is what I didn't see when you first kind of showed me the button as a concept, but it's certainly, I, I use <span style="color:red" data-ts="1803.22" data-end_ts="1803.34" title="1803.22" id=c_"1803.22">__a__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1803.34" data-end_ts="1803.62" title="1803.34" id=c_"1803.34">__mono__</span> often in live performance, and one of the things I notice is that, my dog is like really trying to influence me right now. What I notice in <span style="color:red" data-ts="1816.76" data-end_ts="1816.98" title="1816.76" id=c_"1816.76">__per__</span> in performance a lot of times is that, it, it plays to people's pattern recognition, systems of curiosity mm-hmm. <affirmative>. So they'll see what is my sort of like ultra abstract user interface, and they'll, they'll start playing with it as if it's hieroglyphics. Right. Right. As if they're trying to say, okay, what is the meaning of that circular thing with the thing going around it? Oh, he hits it and when he hits it, the starting point, oh, I wonder if that isn't the loop that's playing, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, oh, there's a thing. And sometimes he presses it and it goes up and sometimes he presses it and it goes down. And that's the same time the volume of something goes up and down. I see people who, again, like you say, they're, they're completely, drawn away from the music to watch the watch the display. But to a certain extent that might actually be a lot more effective and a lot more valuable than, say, having a big screen video display blowing with, some sort of visual eye candy. At least what they're doing is they're really closely tied into the process of performing, which is ostensibly why they're there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Sure. And that's, that's something that's been, you know, discussed a lot, is how to, how to potentially like, help the audience understand, or, or just be able to see, you know, the interface so that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1904.62" data-end_ts="1904.66" title="1904.62" id=c_"1904.62">__you__</span>, they can see that some actual performance is taking place. Around that, around the same time when I started performing, my friend Alfred who goes by Dataless, you know, was also starting to perform, and he, I think he really quickly saw the potential that this, this device would allow in terms of, you know, having a really variable improvised performance. So I gave him, I lent him the prototype, and he then promptly toured the world and, helped popularize in a way that, you know, I couldn't while in while in grad school. But it was, it was definitely, that was definitely something that, that was important, was making sure that people could see what was happening, you know, with the performer's hands and that it wasn't a DJ set, or it wasn't some, it wasn't a kid pressing the play button on the sequencer on their, on their core keyboard. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I was gonna ask about Dataless because he seems to be a really important player in the early days of this. As <span style="color:red" data-ts="1968.74" data-end_ts="1968.94" title="1968.74" id=c_"1968.74">__he__</span> suggests, I think first of all, you're right. He was a person who was out there and, he, he kind of popularized it, but he also did something that I thought was really interesting. He's a first performer that I saw that was using, an interface for his computer based system that would tilt it towards the audience. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Yes. Yes. That's what I was gonna, that's what I was going to suggest. Oh, okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b><laugh>. Yeah. That's, that's exactly, that's, that's exactly what I mean by trying to get the audience to see it, to, to see the interface more. And that, that in a way it fit into, it fit really well into his narrative that he was trying to make with his, you know, stage presence. Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2013.3" data-end_ts="2013.5" title="2013.3" id=c_"2013.3">__You__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2013.5" data-end_ts="2013.54" title="2013.5" id=c_"2013.5">__know__</span>, with his, with his, his costume and his magic weaving and the, you know, he's, he's gone on to make other, to make other, kind of, you know, stage performance sets a big, this, this fantastic big wall of mirrors and, that, that sort of mimic this, this, centerpiece, which is, you know, the, the lit up grid, which creates all of the sound. Right. And so the, the performance is both him and it is also the, the grid, which I, you know, you know, talking to him in the past, I, I feel like it's a similar <span style="color:red" data-ts="2048.34" data-end_ts="2048.46" title="2048.34" id=c_"2048.34">__c__</span> contentious issue. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Whether, whether it's, it's just like, it's like what is, what part is doing the, what part is doing the work, right. In terms of like, is the technology or is, or is it the performer? And I mean, and of course the performer is doing the work is anyone who actually has played one of these nos <span style="color:red" data-ts="2065.42" data-end_ts="2065.66" title="2065.42" id=c_"2065.42">__that__</span> it, it can literally sound horrible if you're doing it badly. You know, and there are absolutely virtuos performers on this, on this device. You know, but still, but, but still, it comes up, quite often, which to me is a very, you know, mundane debate, but the kind of like, what is an instrument? Because I, I, I thought we all understood that everything is an instrument, you know, back when John Cage decided that in the sixties, so Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I think maybe the memo didn't get widely dispersed or something, but <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So that's really interesting. Now, what, what is it design-wise that's speaks to you about sort of like the minimalistic design? <span style="color:red" data-ts="2108.56" data-end_ts="2108.78" title="2108.56" id=c_"2108.56">__Cuz__</span> that is something that's kind of UBI ubiquitous with all of the instruments that you and Kelly and now Trent have, have been putting together is a very minimalist aesthetic, but also it seems to emanate from something deeper. Where did that come from? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2124.68" data-end_ts="2124.9" title="2124.68" id=c_"2124.68">__You__</span> know, when, so during the same time when, when I went to Cal Arts and was working on this grid, this, this second year, my second year at Cal Arts is when, was when Kelly showed up, as an experimental animator. And we've, we met through a mutual friend and decided to start working on these mechanical film installations. So we started actually making, making these physical objects and really, really quickly what I realized is that I was focused on just making things work functionally mm-hmm. <affirmative>. So I was always okay with like, you know, the wires hanging out and you could see the guts and, you know, that was, that was fine. But she, she was always very insistent on the, on the visual presentation. And, you know, making sure to have the emphasis be clear and, you know, have the, have the actual work, get the attention and not, not just kind of fetishize the guts. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>And so in a lot of ways, you know, our collaboration has really shaped the, the identity and the aesthetic. And I think helping recognize that the, the min the minimalism is a way of, of taking away distraction and also having it be as open as possible. And then there's this kind of, there's this kind of last quality that, you know, we both <span style="color:red" data-ts="2209.1" data-end_ts="2209.22" title="2209.1" id=c_"2209.1">__j__</span> just, you know, developed a mutual appreciation for, you know, craftsmanship and that having that fit in with a sort of way that we want to exist in the world in terms of making objects that are going to last and, you know, that are beautiful, that you're gonna wanna spend time around. And you don't wanna have the sense that it's a, it's a disposable object that you will have to, you know, buy again or, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2236.64" data-end_ts="2236.86" title="2236.64" id=c_"2236.64">__and__</span> there's a lot of music equipment that, you know, I, I feel like I've been forced into buying for certain reasons and I, I just have like a guilt surrounding them cuz I know that I don't care about it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Like, the moment, even when it shows up like brand new, it's like, and, you know, and that it eventually probably will end up at a thrift store or it'll be broken in, in <span style="color:red" data-ts="2258.3" data-end_ts="2258.42" title="2258.3" id=c_"2258.3">__a__</span> landfill. So there are sort of layers of responsibility that're also tied up in the way that we, we make these. And I think, you know, we, when we started Mono, you know, we were right out of art school, like, you know, mid, mid twenties, very, very optimistic. And, we're really going to hold to all of our ideals about how the world should work. And, so I think at the beginning, you know, we were pretty, you know, we were pretty righteous about putting forth how, like, how the, the manufacturing methods were going to happen. And, you know, and as a result we had a really, really difficult time figuring out how to do this stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>And, and after a while, once we did figure them out, it kind of mandated that everything was going to be really expensive. And then, you know, that made us really, really nervous. But, I think the commitment to the object just, just made us realize that we were going to have to have to roll with it. And to our surprise, there were, you know, enough, there were enough people that were, that were respecting those decisions. And so we feel incredibly fortunate that, that there's a community that just wanted to support this project that really, all of the people that I approached for, you know, some form of investment or support, they just would not, they would not touch this idea of, especially when it came to the open source element that we were going to, you know, share everything and tell everybody how to make their own if they didn't wanna buy one or they couldn't afford to buy one. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I want to talk about something that may not be super comfortable, but, we'll talk about it anyway. You said that <laugh>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2358.55" data-end_ts="2358.9" title="2358.55" id=c_"2358.55">__cause__</span> that's how I do, sorry. You said that some of this aesthetic really was pointing towards, not fetishizing the guts, but I would say that if there's, if there is a knock on mono, it's sort of like a, a dual knock. One is that you, you fetishize presentation mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And secondly that the stuff is really expensive. Now, we've already talked a little bit about the expensive part of it, and frankly, knowing a number of wind of high-end wind and stringed instrument players, the cost of amano is pretty much paled by even, even, middle, low end violin or a middle, low end saxophone. But for some reason, I think people are, people that are working with computer based stuff and, and keyboards are used to, the plastic, result of a production line that squirts this stuff out, like Sure. Digital poop of some sort mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And, and so you get, you get a knock for the expense. And, and to a certain extent, what that expense really represents is that one, one could think of the mono as sort of like a first world instrument. How, how do you react when you, when you see those kinds of, of knocks? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Well, okay, so most of the time I, I see these, it's on the internet and 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, right? Yeah. You're not, it's, there's not an actual face behind it. Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2456.3" data-end_ts="2456.38" title="2456.3" id=c_"2456.3">__Yeah__</span>. So maybe I'm the first person that's done that. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>I've never, I've never had, like, I've never had like a real conversation like that. I mean, of, of course I've been in a position where people will come up to me in person and we can have this, we can have this discussion, but it's typically really, really fast be because when you have an in-person experience, you're going to have, you're going to have empathy, and you're not going to see that someone's trying to pull something over on you or that, you know, that I'm actually like fantastically wealthy and I've like really cashed in on the electronic music crowd. Right. But the, I think my response is that we, that basically we kind of held to those the ways that we felt comfortable producing these devices. And it's still, you know, it's still just a couple of us and, you know, building these by hand in our, in our home. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>And the, you know, the digital poop machine that you described <span style="color:red" data-ts="2512.38" data-end_ts="2512.58" title="2512.38" id=c_"2512.38">__is__</span> very, it's, it's very real. I mean, the other, other large corporations can leverage, a production and marketing machine that, that make it very viable for them to produce in such quantities, and, you know, use labor that we don't have access to or don't, or choose not to use or choose not to use. Right. And just a lot of things that we consider compromises, but also, you know, compromises in the potential quality of the objects because they know that it's more important for their specific demographic to have something be cheap than to be instead of being, you know, open or something that may potentially last <span style="color:red" data-ts="2554.5" data-end_ts="2554.66" title="2554.5" id=c_"2554.5">__them__</span> a very long time. So I, I don't think that, yeah. Yeah. I think just maybe what you said hit it hit right on the head, which is there's, there's typically not a problem when people imagine a, a very expensive guitar, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Given that there are also incredibly cheap guitars. But, but anyway, so yes, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2576.85" data-end_ts="2577.09" title="2576.85" id=c_"2576.85">__that__</span>, so the comments that I hear like that are, are typically on the internet and, is wonderful of a place is the internet is for sharing. It just, it just seems to let people spend too much time focusing on kind of very negative thought patterns. And you know, what, I feel like what anybody complaining about our devices should really think is like, like, isn't it great that these people were, you know, sufficiently successful in a, in a couple of years to, you know, have let these other big multinational companies, you know, kind of copy the designs and make them accessible to everybody at a very cheap cost. And so you can, you can at least experience something, you know, pretty similar to what we're doing with these objects. And if you acknowledge that, you know, it's a really valuable part of your workflow to, you know, be working with grids, I'm sure at some point you could rationalize, you know, the, the investment into an instrument that's going to kind of, you know, repay you in, in a, you know, creative energy and inspiration over the years. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>And so, you know, when I was trying to develop this thing in school, I got, I got a couple of grants and I, I was, you know, I was, I was willing to spend like innumerable kind of hours and just, an insane amount of efforts to kind of manifest this idea that I thought had so much promise. And so, so I think it's just important to recognize that we all don't have the same value systems and we, you know, we different, different objects have different levels of meaning and different value. And, you know, it's okay if to let you know some group of people be really passionate about something and, you know, you don't have to get really upset that somebody else thinks something is, is worth money. So yeah, it's best to just like, go on and feel, focus on, the, the things that don't make you sad. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, well said. And, and, I'm, I'm glad we brought it up because, you know, I guess in my mind I imagined what your answer was going to be, but hearing you say it is actually really, it's, it's cool. It's cool to hear that. And it's, and I'm also now sitting here with a, one of your most recent grids as well as a couple of other grids that I have from the past. And, because maybe I am a little obsessive, when it comes to my playing surfaces, <laugh> <laugh>. But one of the things that, that from, from the oldest device, device up to the most current that is really pretty amazing, is the level of craftsmanship. Now you talk about these being hand handmade, but you also talk about having some manufacturing processes. What is, what is the handmade part of it and what is the manufactured part? And my God, where do you find manufacturers that can do this kind of, this kind of work? Because if there's anything, it looks more like you're making, like you would have to find people who are skilled at making jewelry rather than typical industrial manufacturers because this, this tolerances on some of these things are amazing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Yeah. And it's, yeah, some of the, some of them I'm, some of them I'm very proud of, and some of them, I feel like I'm still, I'm still refining, you know, the, the grids, it's a little bit shameful the, the perfectionism that plays into this because it means that there are, so, there are too many generations of, of grids which have happened in this, in this kind of, you know, chasing both, you know, reducing the amount of labor that we have to do and kind of making sure that they're going to be robust over time. It <span style="color:red" data-ts="2810.94" data-end_ts="2811.02" title="2810.94" id=c_"2810.94">__was__</span>, like thinking back to like the first, the first 40 hs. Those were all, those were all completely <span style="color:red" data-ts="2817.17" data-end_ts="2817.46" title="2817.17" id=c_"2817.17">__hand__</span> soldered, and we made, you know, 400 units. And, you know, that's where, that's where like Kelly learned how to solder super, super fast. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>And, I can't imagine how many, you know, years of our lives we knocked off with those fumes. Right. But, these, the, the components finding manufacturers is, it's, it's hard. It has to be, it has to come with recommendations, I think. And we, we were very, very fortunate that, one of Kelly's friends from college worked his, his, his father owns a, a medical silicone molding company. Okay. And so, so the first thing we had to overcome was figuring out how to make these keypads because, because, you know, that was not a, that was not something you just found out how to do. But he was, you know, he was willing to kind of, kind of, you know, take us on as a, a little hobby project, but we, you know, we went through a ton of revisions trying to get the tactile snap correct and make it feel like an instrument. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>And I feel like we, we really invested in that where, you know, there are a lot of, there are, there are a lot of, kind of i y keypads available now. And, you know, you can, you can tell that they just, there was a different level of, you know, there wasn't a musician behind that work. Sure. It was just kind of like, make it, make it happen, make the light come through. And the, the, so that was the first big thing. They still make the keypads for us. They're based right outside of Pennsylvania, right outside of, Philadelphia, in Pennsylvania. I, I got a reference from him to a machine shop, you know, down in Baltimore that did all of the aluminum work for us at the beginning. And we've, we've, we've, we've kind of been out-priced since they've, they've, grown and had to, increase their prices. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>So we've been looking around for different places now, but, also referred through them were on the arc, particularly the first edition of the Arc. We weren't quite satisfied with the kind of OEM and coders from Bournes, even though they were wicked expensive. They had just like this tiny bit amount of wobble in them that kind of was like a little bit unpleasant for kind of, you know, this musical level of, of gear fetishism. So we ended up designing our, our own, bearing and shaft mechanism that we had made by a scientific instrumentation company that had incredibly tight tolerances. And this is where we, you know, also learned about all of the different kinds of, you know, sh shaft greases in the world. Their whole industry is devoted to making potentiometers feel a particular way or, you know, make a really cheap switch in the car, feel good when you, when you touch it, turn it, you know, turn a 5 cent switch into something that, you know, feels like the interior of the BMW or something. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>So it, we, it just, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2992.74" data-end_ts="2992.94" title="2992.74" id=c_"2992.74">__the__</span>, yeah. So many different companies involved another company in the arc to create the light separation. It's a, it's a, there are pieces of etched steel in that radial pattern and, you know, the, we in sort of insisted on always using real glass, so it's water jet cut glass in the, in those components. You know, we're very, could have easily saved a lot of money using, you know, laser cut plastic and this sort of thing. The wa the, the wood has always been like the most handmade component of it, and also the most frustrating because, you know, wood is, wood is a living material. And you know, particularly right now in the middle of summer, it's very, very humid. So we're dealing with all of the, all of the expansion and contraction issues of, you know, furniture making and trying to match that with the machined aluminum plate is, I think what's, you know, it's sometimes disappointing to me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>I, I, I mean, I, I appreciate the praise for the, for the worksmanship, but, you know, sometimes the realities of, of, of wood moving, just kind of prevent everything from lining up completely, perfectly. But, you know, seasonally it shifts and it looks perfect again in the, in the wintertime. So <laugh>, so yes, we, I mean, we do all of the, we luckily now have the circuits, you know, assembled by robots in a new, company in California is doing a great job. And we, you know, we were previously using a place in, in Pennsylvania, which, which also kind of grew outside of our, our size limitations. So when a company gets big, then they can't kind of handle our small orders anymore. Right. Which is, which is, which is sad. So, you know, previously we were really sourcing within, you know, within a hundred mile radius almost. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>And now we've, you know, we've spread out, just a little bit more, but, we're still keeping everything inside of the country and, you know, it feels, it feels really good to have, you know, fast, responsive, you know, small companies that we can work, work together with. And, you know, this is how we're able to, you know, turn around, turn around these production runs pretty quickly. But yeah, in the, so in the end of the day, at the end of the day, all of this, all of this stuff is still built. You know, here in our little barn workshop, which, which we've now really only had for about two years prior to this, we, whenever we were doing an addition of something, it's just like the, the living room and the kitchen would just get taken over by all this junk, and we'd <span style="color:red" data-ts="3139.98" data-end_ts="3140.14" title="3139.98" id=c_"3139.98">__have__</span> to, you know, eat standing up for, for <span style="color:red" data-ts="3143.1" data-end_ts="3143.22" title="3143.1" id=c_"3143.1">__a__</span>, a couple of weeks or something like this. So it's, I, I do, I do advise anybody who plans on going into sorts of productions to first and foremost separate, separate your, your life from it a little bit with some physical space <laugh>. It definitely improves everybody's mood. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, in talking with you about this and about the decisions you make and stuff like that, it actually sort of infers an answer to the next question that I was going to have, which was, you know, what are your feelings about, all the many different grid makers that are out there doing their thing? But you've kind of, you've kind of spoke to that, just by saying that there's room for everyone, and you're hoping that there's room for sort of <span style="color:red" data-ts="3189.54" data-end_ts="3189.66" title="3189.54" id=c_"3189.54">__I__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3189.68" data-end_ts="3189.9" title="3189.68" id=c_"3189.68">__end__</span>, which, makes, makes sense, to me. But do, do you ever get irritated by it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>I mean, a little bit. But I really, I mean, I really think that, I really think that the other, the other grid manufacturers are, are capitalizing on some of the, some of the least interesting uses of the grid. And they've really, they've really overlooked the kind of principle, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3222.64" data-end_ts="3222.86" title="3222.64" id=c_"3222.64">__you__</span> know, idea, which I, which I was really excited about was the decoupled nature and the openness and being able to make it do a whole lot of different things. And actually, these, these devices can do this. It's just not, it's, it's not, you know, directly presented to the user as, as the reason for this device to exist. And so it, it, you know, by having, by having like a minimal blank slate, it's inviting people to, to really explore it and own, own the surface. Like both as a, a toolmaker, as an, as an artist, or, just making decisions about how you want to work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>The other part is that, as I said before, these being a, a starting point, which, you know, allows somebody on a budget to, you know, decide whether or not they need, they're interested in making music with grids. That's fantastic because it also, it, it prevents, you know, impulse buying of a very expensive object in being kind of alarmed and disappointed, you know, which, which, which wasn't so big of a deal in the early days when alternatives didn't exist, because somebody could instantly resell it and actually probably make a profit, which was, which was a kind of secondarily horrifying thing that happened in the late two thousands. Right. But, but yeah, I mean, recently, I mean, gr have been around, we started eight years ago, and, you know, I, I feel like they are now in the consciousness of, of, electronic musicians. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>But I, I'm not <span style="color:red" data-ts="3312.04" data-end_ts="3312.33" title="3312.04" id=c_"3312.04">__sure__</span>, IM, I'm not sure, like a, a fully, I'm not sure all electronic musicians have like a fully correct representation of what the, you know, initial intention was with them in terms of being a, a really open platform. So we're hoping to kind of reintroduce a lot of those concepts with, you know, making the, you know, we've tried to make our documentation a lot clear, make it more approachable to people that don't want to program, but just want to explore this huge library of, you know, contributed applications. And, yeah, in terms of being angry about it, it's, you know, maybe, you know, those couple of months where like, you know, we really struggle every once in a while. Like, I can feel a little, a little, frustrated, but, you know, maybe, maybe someday like Novation or somebody will, like give me an artist grant or something and let me make, like, just make music for a month or two and not have to worry about making a living. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Novation, that's a call to action on <laugh>. Well, I wanna explore this idea of openness a little more, because from the very beginning, you've been incredibly open about every part of what you do. And so all of the, all the software that's kind of tied into it is open sourced. And, that has kind of like followed, followed through on every device that you've created. The modules, the, the source code and stuff is available even for the stuff inside those modules. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Yeah. In fact, I just, I just posted that up today and I haven't, gotten a chance to publicize it yet. But yeah, the idea is that, they are available, but I didn't want to kind of promote that as the f kind of fundamental selling point Sure. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3419.1" data-end_ts="3419.46" title="3419.1" id=c_"3419.1">__Because__</span>, you know, open-ended modules already exist and, you know, the, the, you know, the module is really intended for just being able to be instantly usable. And if I feel like the kind of open source programmable, tag kind of scares people away, that they'll have to do a lot of work. And that's definitely true of, like, for example, the Olaf. I mean, it does have things that will launch automatically, that are set up scenes, but it really, that was really a device designed, you know, for building your own, building your own tool set and right. And, and so we're trying to, trying to keep this, trying to keep this as, approachable as possible. But yes, I, I am enthusiastic about potentially, you know, people, people doing some little mods to, to the sequencer or doing, just reinterpreting how the grid works, like with this particular little piece of hardware. And, and, we'll see how that, see how that shapes up. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Well, I wanna kind of explore the idea or sort of like the difference between open-ended and open source. So the open sourcing is, is really clear. It's, the, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="3489.79" data-end_ts="3490.14" title="3489.79" id=c_"3489.79">__tools__</span> or the, the source code that makes up the work that you've done is all available for free. The open-endedness, though, I think that that's something that you have probed in different ways practically with each different iteration of hardware that you've come out with. I, I would say that, and, and you can tell me if I'm wrong, I'm more than happy to have you tell me I'm delusional. But wait until I make the statement before you say that <laugh>. But it seems to me that, because of Dataless, sort of like influence on the early vision of the grid, that for a lot of people, the grid was a tool by which you could play mlr. Or for me, the one that caught my eye was Flynn. It was available to me, but there, but, but the concept for a lot of people was <span style="color:red" data-ts="3549.54" data-end_ts="3549.74" title="3549.54" id=c_"3549.54">__there__</span>, there was still an instrumentation aspect to it, right? It was, or an instrument aspect to it, in that it was kind of combined with a software personality that led people to, to do the thing you did. And I would say that at least for a while, a lot of things that the community came up with were very strongly influenced by mlr. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Certainly though I would, I, it, I think it, it's, I feel like MLR is just such a strong intuitive match for the grid, right. That that's why it really resonated with a lot of people. And it's, you know, the fact that it, it was sample based, you know, made it work with a lot of different, with a lot of different genres. But, you know, pretty quickly, pretty quickly after the grid came around, you know, particularly Matthew Davidson, you know, Stretta started, I think he saw immediately what the potential was with the decoupled grid, like exactly the, the way I did, you know, back in college. And he, he immediately started making, you know, great arpeggiator and, different, different things that were taking advantage of, you know, traditional, you know, traditional harmonics and this, different ways of interacting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>And I think just, just seeing, seeing a community emerge and the, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="3634.73" data-end_ts="3635.02" title="3634.73" id=c_"3634.73">__Wiki__</span>, like really rapidly filling up with different ways to use it, was just, you know, mind, mind blowing to me. And in fact, I mean, even to this day, I haven't had a chance to kind of try even half of the stuff that people have made for the grid in just trying to keep up with just making the grids to keep getting them to people. Right. But, but they, that might have been a, that might have been, I might have diverged you from what you were saying. I'm sorry. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, no, I, no, I, I don't have any grand unifying <span style="color:red" data-ts="3668.36" data-end_ts="3668.78" title="3668.36" id=c_"3668.36">__scheme__</span> to these, podcasts. I'm just kinda riffing off the top of my head. But what I'm, what I'm kind of curious about is, so you start off with a system that seemed to be kind of, because, as you say that, excuse me, MLRs seemed to really be a great match to the grid. There's this sense of <span style="color:red" data-ts="3688.04" data-end_ts="3688.26" title="3688.04" id=c_"3688.04">__an__</span>, of an, in an overall instrument mm-hmm. <affirmative> with the, with the arc and elf, the less so to the point where the elf was, was very much, it, it kind of is a toolbox. Yes. Rather than being an, being an instrument on its own. I mean, you were kind enough to let me, let me play with one for a while. And I, I saw where it sort of matched a lot of the way that you do things, the way that you have events and you have settings and values being able to kind of like cross-fertilize one another. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> was very, was very reminiscent of almost everything that you've, you've, you know, you've provided the community. But now, now with the modules, you're coming back to something that has more of a defined, or in these cases it has a very defined, personality instrument. Personality is, do you personally have a preference? And when you think in terms of developing the instruments or developing these modules, what are the things that influence you to do the things you do? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>I, I think that, well, the modules are really an extension of, you know, the same sorts of programs that we were making that would just run on the run on the computer. And in a lot of ways, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="3771.74" data-end_ts="3771.9" title="3771.74" id=c_"3771.74">__oli__</span> was trying to get the same functionality that, for example, that we could get out of Max, but kind of tie it closely to, you know, a selectable kind of dsp, like a VST plugin that was running internally. And then have that be paired with both, you know, the grid plugged into it with a particular, application and, you know, foot switches and knobs and this sort of thing. So <span style="color:red" data-ts="3794.02" data-end_ts="3794.18" title="3794.02" id=c_"3794.02">__is__</span> the idea of having, having a toolbox that was like a computer or <span style="color:red" data-ts="3798.3" data-end_ts="3798.46" title="3798.3" id=c_"3798.3">__the__</span> ostensibly is a computer, we, cuz we had to make a computer more or less. And then with the modular, I really just liked the idea of being able to have this, this sort of context for the exploration that we're doing with these kinds of sequencers and, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3815.65" data-end_ts="3815.94" title="3815.65" id=c_"3815.65">__yeah__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Different, different applications to live inside the, of this, context with, you know, control voltage and triggers being completely open-ended. And to tell you the truth, I mean, I I, I can't even really still say that I'm like a person who is into modular because I'm really, really bad at buying things. <laugh> <laugh>, most of the, most of the modules that I've gotten have been, you know, for, for trade with, with, different, different people. And, and I really, I really have a good time with it, but I'm also really, I'm really, I'm not scared of, but just like not, not inclined towards like, kind of this like mass collector. So I can't quite tell if I, I know every once in a while it's like I really need something that does percussion of some sort. So, you know, I, I'm excited to kind of continue to build on this idea, but, but I'm, I'm really excited about modular just as this sort of like open data format that there's no complicated like OSC strings and there's no sort of like mapping mechanisms and it's just your plug-in wires together and, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And getting what you get. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Yeah. And, and just, it can be, it can just be so, so versatile. So I'm, so I'm really, I'm really excited to have these, these, kind of grid applications live in that environment where that can be, that can be the, the sound generation. And, I'm really happy to have been, you know, pulled, pulled into this universe and, you know, I keep, I keep discovering things that people have been doing with, you know, modular that, that are, you know, pretty astounding. So I'm looking forward to continuing on. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well that sounds great. And yeah, the modular thing, I, it's, it's kind of funny to me. Whenever, whenever there's an environment that first of all is kind of built around collectivism, which is a little bit what the modular world is, the, the methods that different people use in order to prevent just mania from taking over. Like, so for my, my example, I actually actively have gotten rid of any case other than the ones that I have to. So now I can say, now I can't really get any more modules cause I don't have a place to put 'em, <laugh>. I mean, that's sort of like that faux discipline that, you know, I guess card collectors have to do, you know, oh, my, my, booklet where I keep all my trading cards is full, so I can't buy any more trading cards. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>I think that's, that's really important being you <span style="color:red" data-ts="3971.42" data-end_ts="3971.58" title="3971.42" id=c_"3971.42">__have__</span> beans being selective and acknowledging when you don't use a particular tool. And I mean, maybe that's more what I'm, what I'm thinking is if if suddenly I realize all of these, all of these tools are indispensable in some sort of way, I'm going to have to, you know, dedicate a room to this 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Stuff. So. Yeah. Well, I have to admit though, I your, your style of discipline is another one of those aspirational things, because I can't seem to actually be able to say, well, I need to be more disciplined about my life, <laugh>. I have to, I have to create artificial structures to make that happen. So good for you. Not so good for me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Oh, all right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>All right. So before we go, and I have used up a lot of your time already, I really appreciate the time you've spent. I wanna talk a little bit again about your, your recent releases. The, the names of them are escaping me right now. Could you, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>The, on, on the Leap, which is, the, new <span style="color:red" data-ts="4032.18" data-end_ts="4032.38" title="4032.18" id=c_"4032.18">__modern__</span> community, label, it's, the name of the album is Sky Clad, and I have links to this stuff via my website, which is, nnn <span style="color:red" data-ts="4042.16" data-end_ts="4042.38" title="4042.16" id=c_"4042.16">__nnn__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="4042.38" data-end_ts="4042.5" title="4042.38" id=c_"4042.38">__n__</span> n n <span style="color:red" data-ts="4043.02" data-end_ts="4043.14" title="4043.02" id=c_"4043.02">__n__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="4043.54" data-end_ts="4044.26" title="4043.54" id=c_"4043.54">__n.org__</span>, which is <span style="color:red" data-ts="4044.72" data-end_ts="4044.94" title="4044.72" id=c_"4044.72">__aid__</span> nst 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Org eight Ns. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>And then, and then, through Detroit Underground is, is a, is an EP of two sides. It's, 18th Weathervane. And, he's actually hand <span style="color:red" data-ts="4057.06" data-end_ts="4057.3" title="4057.06" id=c_"4057.06">__cutting__</span> these, these, these records. So it's a little 10 inch, clear vinyl. They're, they're really gorgeous. And, I'm really excited to, you know, have some music actually committed to a physical medium. Sure. And, I also wanna say that, you know, Kelly also just released her, her, you know, first album, which is first, first magnitude, which is also on the leap and, and it's spectacular. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, fantastic. Well look at that. What, what did you use to create, these things? <span style="color:red" data-ts="4088.46" data-end_ts="4088.78" title="4088.46" id=c_"4088.46">__Because__</span> though the times that I've seen you perform mm-hmm. <affirmative>, almost always it's been like, you know, a computer, a grid and roads. Right. But it's clearly in listening to this, there's a lot more going on. What did you, what, what kind of tools did you use to, to actually make these, make these albums? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>It, it was, it was really varied on these, on these tracks, and I tend to, you know, while I tend to, you know, create a lot of software and hardware, I get a real, I get pretty nervous about kind of overusing technology when making music so on, you know, on sky clad, there's a lot of, you know, me, you know, shaking grass into a microphone. And, there's, you know, some pretty, pretty simple synthesizer things that then end up sounding completely not simple after they get run through some olive patches <span style="color:red" data-ts="4142.74" data-end_ts="4142.86" title="4142.74" id=c_"4142.74">__a__</span> a couple of times. The metaphysics is used in there to create some kind of, you know, generative melodies. And, you know, I, I still really enjoy, you know, Juno 1 0 6 into a space Echo <laugh>. It's, it's just like, it's so cliche, but it's, it just feels so impossibly good to play those two things together. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's, it's funny you say that because to me, that if, if I had sort of like the dream combo, why it'd be, you know, like you think of the Desert Island synth thing or whatever, which if actually, if you do think <span style="color:red" data-ts="4180.94" data-end_ts="4181.14" title="4180.94" id=c_"4180.94">__of__</span>, tend to think about that a lot, well, too bad for you. Yeah. But, the fact is, you know, if you think about that some of the most enjoyable, the, the two most enjoyable instrument combos have been one, exactly what you said, a 1 0 6 with, Roland Space Echo. And then, and then when I used to play an MPC a lot, there was something about just like beating on pads without, without any kind of screen or anything like that, that was actually really compelling. What do you use as a recording media? Do you just record to, to <span style="color:red" data-ts="4217.58" data-end_ts="4217.82" title="4217.58" id=c_"4217.58">__Heart__</span> Drive, or do you have, tape that hidden away in the barn somewhere? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>I do, I do re record to various things, but, you know, mostly, mostly just into whatever, you know, digital audio workstation I'm using at the moment. I have a really hard time with a allegiances. So I think between all that music I used, I used Reaper at some point. I used Ableton, I, all of Sky <span style="color:red" data-ts="4248.86" data-end_ts="4249.06" title="4248.86" id=c_"4248.86">__Cloud__</span> was done on Bit Whig, which Okay. It's, it's a pretty fascinating environment. Oh, on, on the, on the, on the Detroit Underground, record, a lot of, almost actually all of it, yeah. All of the, all of the synth sounds on, on Weathervane were, created with Alto by, Madrona Labs, Randy Jones. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Which is basically, I, I think the only soft s synth I use. And it's just, it's truly spectacular. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, it is. In fact. Well, Brian, I'm, I'm gonna let you, get on with your life. We're, we've spent a lot of time on the phone here and, as, as with all these things, you know, I start off wondering, are we gonna get a good hour out of it, and then an hour in, I'm like, well, now that I've just started, I have a whole bunch more. I'd love to talk about <laugh>. But frankly, I mean, we, we kind of touched on things that I hadn't seen in, in interviews before where you got a chance to talk about some specific things. I appreciate that, appreciate your willingness to do this and, be part of the podcast. And, and also for, for talking about some of the future because I, I feel like, the mono world had been kind of in stasis for a while, and it's really the introduction of the modular stuff has really, as well as some of the new design, that new grid design is just gorgeous beyond belief. I think that there's some real excitement in the mono community again. And so I'm glad to get a chance to talk to you, about that. 
</p>
