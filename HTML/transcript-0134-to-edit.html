<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. This week I have the pleasure of talking to somebody. I've met him, I've met him out in LA and I've gotten a chance to see some of his work, and it's pretty phenomenal. His name is David <span style="color:red" data-ts="23.075" data-end_ts="23.365" title="23.075" id=c_"23.075">__Beri__</span>, and he runs a little shop called <span style="color:red" data-ts="26.075" data-end_ts="26.365" title="26.075" id=c_"26.075">__Beri__</span> Interactive. I was just about to call it Beri International. Maybe that'll be a couple years from now. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David Beaudry: </b><laugh>. Right. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But, Beri and Interactive has a great gig, which is doing interactive software, hardware, media, <span style="color:red" data-ts="43.115" data-end_ts="43.405" title="43.115" id=c_"43.115">__rich__</span> environments for everything from kids theme parks to int Televis shows, to, to theater and dance, dance work. It's, it's a phenomenal, phenomenally broad range of work. So with that, that stammering introduction, what I'm gonna do is actually talk to <span style="color:red" data-ts="65.845" data-end_ts="66.005" title="65.845" id=c_"65.845">__Dave__</span> and let him tell us about it. Say, Hey David. How are you doing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Ah, doing great. Thanks so much for having me here. I'm looking forward to the conversation. Yeah, well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thanks a lot for being willing to take some time out to do this. I know you're a pretty busy guy, so, it's nice to be able to, to get a little bit of your time. Oh, certainly. So, so I kind of did, I kind of stumbled over myself trying to explain what you do. Why don't you do the elevator pitch for us? 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Oh, goodness gracious. You know, it's one of those things that, I've always struggled with over the years of trying to condense what we do into the five second, summary. Well, right now, what the elevator pitch is, it's, we do interaction design and performance technology. And with that, it's kind of two, two approaches that we take. First, we like looking at experiences and trying to figure out how we can make them dynamic. How can we empower the guests? How can we empower performers? What are the handles that we can give into a show? Why would we give the handles into a show? How does it affect a story? So we look at it conceptually first for a lot of these projects. And then, what's really nice is that we can put on a different hat, and then we look at the, you know, how do we solve that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>What tools do we bring in? What hardware, what software? What do we bring in the backend to kind of make those connections? How do we sense things? How do we, how do we, what's the show control that we're using? How do we actually get, when someone's moving around and waving their hands, how do we get the right output and have it make a meaning as far as story or structure or, or, you know, within the context of a performance. So, yeah, that's kind of, in general, that's the kind of the approach that we, that we take with this kind 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Of work. Right. So you actually get involved then in the design and sort of like the imagining of ideas as well as the implementation. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Yes, definitely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's, that's really interesting. How did you get, how did you get into that? I'm, 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Oh, sometimes I feel like I lost a bet. <laugh>. Nice. Well, it's, it's really interesting 'cause my, my background is in, well, I, I've followed two paths for most of most of my life. I started playing the clarinet in almost 10 uhhuh <affirmative> and, you know, kind of never really put it down for almost 30 years, and actually ended up getting a doctorate in clarinet. Which always surprised everybody that you could actually get a doctorate in an instrument. Great. At the same time, I was always really active and not just active. I mean, my degrees are actually in the math and sciences, atmospheric sciences. I was doing research and my microbial ecology and, you know, all sorts of craziness. And so got into, you know, a lot of logical thinking and approaches to things. A little bit of programming certainly got introduced to technology. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>And along the way, I kind of, I got introduced to a, a, a great professor Robert Winter up at UCLA, who kind of helped me bring those two worlds together. I was always keeping 'em separate, you know, it was always one or the other. And in, in the conversations I had with him and in actually taking some of his classes, it, I really got bit by the bug of trying to figure out what role technology can play <span style="color:red" data-ts="253.025" data-end_ts="253.245" title="253.025" id=c_"253.025">__in__</span>. And, and then for me it was <span style="color:red" data-ts="254.565" data-end_ts="254.765" title="254.565" id=c_"254.565">__with__</span>, in the context of traditional performance, it was, how do I do it with my clarinet? How do I do it in theater? And then by extension, how do we get that into dance and themed entertainment? So it's, it all kind of grew from the desire to bring, you know, those two parts of my life together in some way. Yeah. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="272.685" data-end_ts="272.845" title="272.685" id=c_"272.685">__it__</span> kind of evolved into a, into the work that I do today. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. What class was it that Professor Winter was doing that caught your attention? 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>It was, it was actually specifically a music technology class. Which is kind of funny because his background isn't necessarily in technology either. So, I mean, I think that's one of the reasons why we bonded so well. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, he's actually a performer and a brilliant musicologist and, and, music, music theorist and historian. And along the way he kind of got involved in technology. He was one of the first people to put together a CD rom, an interactive CD rom. And it was kind of a, a click and play and explore of, I forget what the first piece was. It was one of Mozart symphonies. And, and at the time, this is when, you know, CD rom drives cost thousands of dollars. Right. And he was just one of the first people that kind of was, again, trying to bridge that gap. How can we use technology to explore and find new, you know, pathways into the art? 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>And it wasn't so much the class that he was teaching that <span style="color:red" data-ts="339.955" data-end_ts="340.245" title="339.955" id=c_"339.955">__that__</span> wasn't the content necessarily. It was just, you know, the enthusiasm and the, and the doors that seem to open of, of, you know, if you start bringing in these other disciplines into something that's, you know, trying to remain pure Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, being traditional performance, you know, especially for, for an orchestral musician, it, it, it was, it was very enlightening. And, and he, he just, all he <span style="color:red" data-ts="365.245" data-end_ts="365.285" title="365.245" id=c_"365.245">__had__</span> to do was say a couple words and I'd be like, oh, yeah, that's great. <laugh>. And I just, I would just go nuts and, and, you know, start exploring and, and, you know, trying to find different ways of bringing in technology into my own work and Sure. It was fascinating. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So what kind of timeframe was this that you were introduced to him? 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>This was probably 94, 95. Yeah. I was just, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I was gonna say, yeah, <laugh>, it's, it sounded like that time when you could start getting your hands on music technology, but it wasn't completely sussed out yet. 'cause now when people say, Hey, there's a music technology class, it's like, really everybody understands what that means. You're gonna learn a sequencer, you're gonna learn how to use, how to use a control service, you know, when you talk about music technology. Right, right. It's like really clearly laid out what that means. But at that time, in the, the early to mid nineties, you know, clearly MIDI was floating around, but there's, digital audio was starting to show up. And also, you know, some, there was some kind of aggressive toying around with weird, instrument design. It was kind of a, a, a very, a very well <laugh>, maybe I'll say it this way. It was a very well fertilized garden at that moment, you 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Know? Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="446.705" data-end_ts="446.925" title="446.705" id=c_"446.705">__No__</span>, no, definitely. And, and, and at a time that I was getting into it, just like you're saying, it was just the time of doing real-time DSP. Right. So it was, you know, I was kind of at the right place at the right time. 'cause, because for me, I wasn't so much into, into synthesis or any of any of that stuff. I, I wanted to play my clarinet. I wanted to record it. I wanted to do, you know, figure out other things that I could do with the clarinet. Right. And even for me, it was just like, well, how can I, you know, can I do poetry while I'm playing the clarinet? Can I do, which it really was one of my first, you know, clarinet slash sound design pieces was actually, a shell Silverstein poem snowman in July. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>And again, it was just at the beginning I remember using like an apple talk microphone, uhhuh. Right. Those little ones that came with <laugh> and, you know, recording in my apartment, which had this crazy reverb. And anyway, just kind of just getting bit by that bug. 'cause it was just, it was just at the beginning of that, you know, kind of consumer approachable, real <span style="color:red" data-ts="510.285" data-end_ts="510.485" title="510.285" id=c_"510.285">__time__</span> DSP. And, and I think that's, you know, it again, it was just kind of being at the right place at the right time and having the right people to kind of say, Hey, look over here. And, and, yeah. I hadn't, hadn't really looked back since. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So one of the things that you sort of glossed over there, you talked about how you started, clarinet when you were 10. When was it that you started playing around with technology and with tech stuff? I mean, were you the kind of kid that was like, would like take a radio and tear it apart to see where the music was coming from? Or was that stuff kind of a later adventure for you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>It was, it was a later adventure actually. 'cause it was funny 'cause I, you know, you hear all these stories of these brilliant people that have worked in, in this industry and all of 'em have these fantastic origin stories of, you know, I've <span style="color:red" data-ts="560.805" data-end_ts="560.965" title="560.805" id=c_"560.805">__found__</span>, you know, found this shortwave radio and started taking it apart and putting it back together again. And, no, not me, I was just very curious about all sorts of different types of technology. I had chemistry sets at home and electricity kit and, you know, the making simple circuits. But, you know, nothing really grabbed me. It was like, this is what I wanted to go into. I think I was really, what really got me into it was more of the scientific process. I know that sounds kind of weird, especially if I was a kid, but I love trying to figure out how things worked and kind of taking 'em apart and, kind of deriving how, how things were, were put together. Mm-Hmm. <span style="color:red" data-ts="599.605" data-end_ts="599.645" title="599.605" id=c_"599.605">__<affirmative>__</span>. And so, I mean, that's one of the reasons why I always would do so well in math and, and a lot of times in the sciences. 'cause I, I hated memorizing anything, so I would always try to figure out how to get an answer and that kind of rather, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Rather than memorize the table 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Rather than memorizing it. Yeah, exactly. So that kind of, I, I think it was, it was that approach in, in math and science that I, that really got me, that really got me excited. So it wasn't necessarily any, any particular type of technology or, or anything that, that reach out and grab me. It was the process. I think that was really kind of exciting to me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Now, one of the things that also kind of happened at the time, and especially when you were talking about nascent DSPN stuff is you had to kind of do some sort of coding in some way, some sort of programming function. Right? Right. What was your introduction to that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Well, that was, that was interesting. Especially well with programming, because I actually came to UCLA to get a doctorate in atmospheric sciences, doing climate modeling. So I had a little bit of programming chops. I was doing more of the analysis side. Okay. But I knew, I knew FORTRAN 77, which, you know, I'm sure everyone knows that kind of dates me. Fortunately it was past, punch cards. Right. <laugh>, but I, you know, so I had a little bit of experience with programming, but nothing that was in the way of doing any sort of media programming. And, and so what, and, and I, after I had, you know, kind of embraced the idea of dealing with technology and then figuring out how to bring it into, into my clarinet, it took me a couple years to figure out how to do that and what was the right tools to use. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>And just by accident, there was a, a gallery opening at UCLA and my advisor had introduced me to a visiting professor in architecture. And he said, I think he's using a really interesting tool. You should go and use this. And he was using Max. And that was my first introduction to Max. And he was using it pretty, pretty simply. It was, it was mainly just, oh, what was that thing called? It was just infrared MIDI device thing. You waved your hands around it. So he had that and had a very simple patch. So you do that. And it was playing some notes. And I was like, well, that's kind of cool. And then, and then that's when things got, you know, started getting kind of crazy for me. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, because I finally had found an environment that could possibly do the things that I wanted to do. Having been introduced to that. Then I just, I went nuts and I, I <laugh> downloaded the software, started doing all the tutorials. It was all self-motivated, self-taught. It was like, I've gotta learn this. And I learned, you know, max within a couple, couple months. And, yeah. And then obviously never, never looked back from that either. I've continued <laugh>. I think there's been rarely a day that I have not actually programmed in Max. Oh, that's interesting. Since then. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, one of the things I think that a lot of people can't imagine is a time when it was possible to program, but almost oppressively hard to use media. Right? Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Yeah. Exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>For those of us that, that, you know, struggled through it, the incredible experience of that first postage stamp size QuickTime video under your control <laugh>. Yeah. Amazing. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>It is, no, definitely. Even just the first recording, I mean, you, what was it at the time that I was using, sound edit 16. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>I mean, just, just doing that and then doing multiple tracks. I mean, that was, that was, that was a eye-opener for me too. I mean, just all that, all that media stuff. Yeah. Or 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Grab a section and immediately reverse it and it'd be like, oh 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Yeah. Exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Amazing. Right. <laugh>, you know, now that's, that's something we <span style="color:red" data-ts="828.405" data-end_ts="828.605" title="828.405" id=c_"828.405">__takes__</span>, takes so much for granted. But, you know, even in the programming tools, I think it's, you know, people are, sometimes I, I hear people who are like into programming kind of poo-pooing the, sort of media <span style="color:red" data-ts="844.155" data-end_ts="844.645" title="844.155" id=c_"844.155">__focused__</span> development environments. But, you know, my response to that is, why do you want to shackle people with having to figure out how wave file headers work, <laugh>? Well, what they really want to do is do something interesting with a wave file. Right. Right. It doesn't make sense to say that, that you have to, you have to struggle through that gritty stuff in order to enjoy the experience. And so, that's it, it's cool to, to know that that was a real enabler for you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>No, definitely. And, and it's, and it is exactly what you're saying. It was just like, I, I, you could immediately start making things within 20 minutes of sitting down, and learning the software as opposed to if you were writing it in c or whatever, whatever the language at the time was. It's, exactly what you're saying. You had to learn how to, you know, read the headers, you know, to translate all the zeros in ones afterwards and figure out how <span style="color:red" data-ts="900.285" data-end_ts="900.485" title="900.285" id=c_"900.285">__it__</span> actually turns into music. And, yeah. The, the being introduced. And it's, and it was funny that it, I mean, it really was one of my first real introductions into a, into programming was Max mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, you know, I didn't know that, you know, I mean, like I said, I did a little bit of Fortran stuff, but that was mostly just for, you know, trying to get plots made right. And analyzing data sets. So there wasn't anything terribly complicated with that. So, I mean, starting, having able to start at that level, I mean, it opened up so many doors and, and for someone who wanted to be creative, it was like, well, I don't have to learn, you know, the fundamentals of how this happens. I now, you know, I know now I just have to learn how to control that tool, not how the tool was made. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So what were, what did some of your first explorations then look like? Because, you know, it sounds like all this stuff kind of was in a collision course and like crashed all at one time, kind of 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b><laugh>. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So what were, what came out of it? What were your first expressions of coding and technology and music and art and all this stuff? What, what did the first bits look like? 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Well, the first piece that I did was pretty funny. It was, I, I think the first approach I wanted to take. 'cause I, I was never one into trying to change. I'd spent so many years trying to get my clarinet to sound the way it does. Mm-Hmm. <laugh>. And I love the way I sound <laugh>. I don't <span style="color:red" data-ts="991.045" data-end_ts="991.085" title="991.045" id=c_"991.045">__know__</span> if anyone else does. My mom probably does <laugh>, but <laugh>. But, you know, you work so much on that. And, and so the last thing I actually wanted to do was to, to take my sound and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1001.525" data-end_ts="1001.685" title="1001.525" id=c_"1001.525">__then__</span> manipulate in some way. Right. So what I immediately started doing was, okay, well, what other things can I reach out to? And so the first piece that I did was, going back to your QuickTime reference, was actually, I, it was a time of when the first matrix had come out. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>So there was that green screenshot of Keanu dodging the bullet scene where that kind of spun around. And, which is now used as a shot everywhere, but at that time it was pretty exciting. So I did that and, played a piece by Astro <span style="color:red" data-ts="1033.645" data-end_ts="1033.765" title="1033.645" id=c_"1033.645">__p__</span> Zola, a little tango <span style="color:red" data-ts="1034.775" data-end_ts="1035.125" title="1034.775" id=c_"1034.775">__Etude__</span>, and basically made Keanu dance <laugh>, nice. And so my part with that and how I was using Max was I was doing real-time analysis of what I was playing. So I knew exactly where I was within the score. And the, I knew, you know, the pitches I was playing and the volumes and all that sort of stuff. And I used those, not only those, those places in the score to control motion of the video, but also as, you know, paying attention to the, some of the nuances. How fast did I do a particular thing would control what speed he rotated at, or what direction he did, or if there was a particular volume that I was doing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>So I was really trying to get into more of what can I, you know, quote unquote sense with what I'm doing with my clarinet, and then what are those interesting connections that I can start making into other forms of media and, and then later into, into the environment. So yeah, that's, so that's kind of what's what got me. That was the very first piece that I did. And then after that, it was, it was kind of interesting. I, I ended up getting a little bit of a detour because, there was a lot of professors, particularly in design and media arts, that found that I was both a musician and a sound designer and could program Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So I started, becoming their developers for some installations. Right. And started getting into, and, and that was interesting because that got me into, you know, all the different types of sensing technologies and what was, you know, what was available, and then what could we build and, you know, invent or whatever. And, and so that, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's nice, nice to do that on someone else's dime. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1134.865" data-end_ts="1135.085" title="1134.865" id=c_"1134.865">__Oh__</span>, trust me, <laugh>. And I got <span style="color:red" data-ts="1136.405" data-end_ts="1136.485" title="1136.405" id=c_"1136.405">__to__</span>, I got to see a lot of, a lot of Europe <laugh> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1138.925" data-end_ts="1139.045" title="1138.925" id=c_"1138.925">__Yeah__</span>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1139.185" data-end_ts="1139.405" title="1139.185" id=c_"1139.185">__On__</span> someone else's dime too, which was quite lovely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's cool. Well, it's interesting though that, going back to this idea of not wanting to, not wanting to manipulate the sound of the clarinet, but adding to it, I actually think, so I've gotten a chance to see some of your work. In fact, you know, I moved up here near Minneapolis, and this last weekend I took a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1164.565" data-end_ts="1164.765" title="1164.565" id=c_"1164.565">__co__</span> couple of kids up to the Crayola experience Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and saw, a thing that you had done for them called Rainbow Rain. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Yes. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And what I thought was interesting was you found a way to take this very, this very fantastical thing of like pouring paint, but combining it with, the image, the unchanged images of kids in front of the screen. It's now the kids could run and the paint's splashing over their images, but it's still clearly an image of the kit. Right. You know, so it's, what you did was you took the image of the kit and you added stuff to it. I also watched the video that you shared with me about, about how you put sensors inside of a, inside of a wand, and then by <span style="color:red" data-ts="1214.465" data-end_ts="1214.885" title="1214.465" id=c_"1214.465">__follow__</span> tracking certain kind of movements and stuff, an actor using <span style="color:red" data-ts="1219.205" data-end_ts="1219.485" title="1219.205" id=c_"1219.205">__this__</span> wand could summon up storms and crushing trees and all this stuff, <laugh>. Right. Again, it's, it's like providing an adjunct function to an existing performer rather than either replacing the performer or in some way changing what they actually do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>No, exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And I think it's, I think it's kind of interesting that from your very first piece, you still kind of have, you know, know the things you're choosing to do and the thing the way you're choosing to do them seems to be like, I'm taking the real thing and enhancing it, but not in any intrinsic way, changing the real thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>No, that's <laugh> that's really interesting. 'cause it, it, it, now <span style="color:red" data-ts="1266.115" data-end_ts="1266.405" title="1266.115" id=c_"1266.115">__that__</span> you've mentioned it has guided almost all of the work that I've done is, is having, I mean, it's, and again, it's, it's ba you know, it goes back to me being a, you know, a very traditional, classically trained performer and, and knowing the, the time and effort that it's taken to master that craft, I never really wanted to go to, to approach anyone else and say, well, you know, all this stuff that you've done, I'm gonna throw that out and we're gonna do this. Right. I, I've always wanted to try to figure out how to enhance, you know, how, how, how to, how to make new connections. Right. Rather than alter, you know, existing, you know, existing structures and, and sounds and movements and stuff like that. So it's, no, it's really, it's, it's a really interesting observation. But yeah, it's definitely been a motivation for sure. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it also resonates for me. I've had a chance, one, one of the most interesting things that I've had a chance to do is work with a dance company doing like really large format, I imagery behind them while they danced. And, I've also had a chance to see work that other people have done. And, you know, I'll go to some, and it's like these, there's these beautiful dancers, but behind them is an 80 foot wall with a great big particle system. And it's impossible to watch the dancer because the particle system overwhelms your senses. Right, exactly. In a way, it, it takes away from the thing that's actual, in order to sort of like, do this particle system demo, for example. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And it's something that I found really disturbing in a lot of media art in these live performance environments. And so I always made it like a real personal, there was like a real personal commitment to me or by me to say, you know, what I'm gonna do is point back to the dancers rather than try to replace them or distract from them. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b><laugh>. Right. No, exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And it seems like a lot of the work that you do has that function as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>No, definitely. And then, you know, we've done the, we've, we've also worked with dance, we work with the Diablo Dance Theater here out of LA and I don't know if just an amazing acrobatic, almost suicidal <laugh> dance company with the stuff that they do. Okay. There was, we, we collaborated with them on a, on a piece, and it was exactly the, exactly what you were saying. We, and it, and it's been a kind of a mantra of ours in the background. It was like, yeah, we use a lot of high-end technology and low-end technology. We use a lot of media. But the idea is that that needs to go away. You don't want anyone coming out saying, wow, that was a really pretty picture, or, that technology was awesome. It's like, how did they track that? You want them coming out and talking about the dance. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Right. You want <span style="color:red" data-ts="1434.925" data-end_ts="1435.085" title="1434.925" id=c_"1434.925">__them__</span> and, and that there was something else that was a part of it that, you know, maybe they can put their finger on it, maybe they can't. I mean, for us with Diablo, it was trying to figure out, I don't think anyone knew in the end that, except for the dance company that we had sensors and that there was a lot, there <span style="color:red" data-ts="1453.125" data-end_ts="1453.245" title="1453.125" id=c_"1453.125">__was__</span> several interactive moments within that piece. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So, for instance, one of the dancers in the opening sequence, it was a, it was a really interesting collaboration. It was a, a collaboration with a spoken word artist, sound designer slash composer, and then obviously with all the dancers and then with us, and we kind of played a role of the middleman. And in this case, it was trying to figure out a way of getting the dancer, making, finding a way to have them be the voice of the spoken word, which is already prerecorded. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>So we, you know, put sensors in his costume and almo, you know, turned him into an instrument. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So his, so again, the focus was on him, on his movements. And he, as a performer was, it became an extension of him. It's like, not only was his movement, he can now could trigger text and do it in any way that he wanted to, based on how he felt. And it became an extra element that did nothing but enhance his performance and, and the emotional impact of the scene. But 100% of the attention was focused on him and what he was doing. And the same thing with the other elements that we were doing. You know, we put sensors in, in skateboard decks and on, and on, quarter pipes. And, no one knew that it was done, but it was done to kind of get an immediacy of response and to what the performers were doing. So that when they did something, the environment immediately responded to them. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1543.665" data-end_ts="1543.885" title="1543.665" id=c_"1543.665">__It__</span>, it responded to them in that, in that moment Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So it was more, more for them. And it was more for, you know, as an extension of them and as an extra tool for them. And also from the audience point of view, it was just something that was just very holistic. There was just more to, to the dance, to their, to their movements. But again, everything was focused on, focused on them. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Now, when you're helping, when you're helping people design this, whether it's, whether it's experienced designers in a theme park or choreographers and dancers in a company, or directors and actors in a theater or whatever, how, first of all, how often do you find yourself having to say, I don't think that's a good idea, 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b><laugh>. You know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And then the other, the other thing is, how often are you put in a position of sort of having <span style="color:red" data-ts="1608.625" data-end_ts="1608.845" title="1608.625" id=c_"1608.625">__to__</span> say the direction you want to go in my artistic voice don't, aren't a match and we probably shouldn't work together. Do you find it happening much? 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Not too much, because by the time we've gotten to the point where we're working together, we've already hashed that out. I see. Okay. Right. Which, which is great. I mean, there's a, there's reason there's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1626.485" data-end_ts="1626.525" title="1626.485" id=c_"1626.485">__sort__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1626.525" data-end_ts="1626.565" title="1626.525" id=c_"1626.525">__of__</span> the 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Front end dance, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>It it is, it is. And a lot of people, because in particular when we got started in this is, you know, going into this full steam in 2006, Interac, you know, interaction design was, was new. The fact of doing any sort of a show that was, you know, possibly non-linear, and, and no one even knew what that meant at that time, that, you know, that could be triggered by per, you're, like, you're giving control to performers. You know, that's, you're crazy. Right. So if they were already talking to us about a particular show, we had gotten past that threshold and, and that we were, you know, kindred spirits in some way for, you know, we've been very fortunate that that has not really come up. And I think too, going back to what you were saying is that our focus has never been, we've never come in with a particular tool like, we have to use this particular technology and this particular system. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>It's always been about what the end experience needs to be. And then we step back and say, okay, what are the right tools for this? What do we have to build for this? And having that approach where the content and the experience is paramount to anything kind of, you avoid those pitfalls <span style="color:red" data-ts="1697.425" data-end_ts="1697.645" title="1697.425" id=c_"1697.425">__of__</span>, of having, you know, like if you've take, if you, if we had gone down the road of particularly a part taking a particular technology, choosing a particular technology for a job that could in, you know, down the road really limit what the performance can be. Right. You know, it starts defining, you know, what the flavor of the performance is. Right. Right. And, and fortunately because of the approach that we always take to these kinds of projects, we try to remain as open as we possibly can all the way to the end until, until we actually have to start developing and bring in the tools that are appropriate for that particular experience. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>But it's the experience itself that's been, that's been paramount. I think that one of the hardest challenges that we usually have is when people start coming in with a preconceived idea of what the technology should be, and then trying to, trying to convince them that it's, that it's not the right tool to use and that what they want to get in the end isn't going, you know, the tool that they want to focus on isn't going to get them the end result that they're, that they're looking for. Right. I think that's been one of the, the hardest things. And the other hard thing for us is being brought in at the end, <laugh>. Oh, of course. After all, all the work is done and, you know, all the conceptual designs been finished and the scripts have been written, and, and, and then we get brought in at the end, you know, it's like an afterthought. It's like, oh yeah. And we wanna make this interactive <laugh> <laugh>. And we're like, okay. So then it's trying to figure out how you can shoehorn, you know, an interactive experience into something that was never really conceptualized as being interactive. Right. That, that becomes a really, a really big challenge for us. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Do you find yourself put in a, I mean, you mentioned being a middleman, but I think you were talking conceptually, but do you ever actually find yourself being a middleman of like, between one player says, here's what we want technology <span style="color:red" data-ts="1810.195" data-end_ts="1810.485" title="1810.195" id=c_"1810.195">__wise__</span>, and another player says, here's what we want, performance wise, and you're brought into glue the pieces together. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Yeah. No, definitely. 'cause we're the only ones usually on <laugh>, on location or wherever we are that can speak both languages. Right. So we can talk to the artist, we can talk to the director, we can talk to the programmers. So we're, we, we literally play a translator role, for a lot of that and trying to figure out, you know, what the intentions were of the performer or what the desires of the performer and how that gets translated into, you know, into code or hardware, whatever that that's needing to be. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Because I think in terms of like bigger show type type environments or, particularly theme theme park type environments, you, there are already, those people have their controller systems in place. So if you're going to provide data, you have to do a lot of formatting it, it to make it work with their existing systems or like big show control systems, they're all using Q <span style="color:red" data-ts="1875.185" data-end_ts="1875.405" title="1875.185" id=c_"1875.185">__Lab__</span> or whatever. Right. And you need <span style="color:red" data-ts="1877.045" data-end_ts="1877.125" title="1877.045" id=c_"1877.045">__to__</span> be able to feed 'em data that makes sense in that context. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Right. No, exactly. And and I, and, and that's definitely the approach we've taken. I mean, obviously we've built tools for doing audio playback and video playback and any other stuff, but yeah. If we're working with someone like Disney, they're very entrenched in their, in their existing systems. But I think that's one of the things that I've loved about Max and why I've continued to use it through all these years, is that, it has, you can get handles into anything, right. Whether it's network, whether it's midi, whether it's serial, whether it's some other format. Okay. We're not the one doing the playback, but we can talk to the device that's doing the, so, so again, we kind of play that, that middleman that, you know, that bridge role of, you know, we're gonna translate, we're gonna figure out what a performer's doing, what a guest is doing, what a group of people are doing, and what conceptually that will mean and, you know, to the design, to the experience Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And then translate that into, okay, you have to trigger these particular sound cues and you know, this is where you're gonna pan this and this is the video content you're gonna put up and here's the pyro you're gonna trigger and, you know, whatever else that you need to need to do. No, we, we've often found ourselves in, in those roles, and, and that's roles that we're fine. We're, especially when it comes to pyro, we don't want to deal with <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1955.335" data-end_ts="1955.685" title="1955.335" id=c_"1955.335">__Would__</span> be the ones responsible for that. It's like, we'll talk, we'll talk to the system, and your system is the one that has to figure out whether or not you should blow up <laugh>, blow up somebody, <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>We'll give you the number seven. What you do with it is your problem. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Exactly. Exactly. No, we're more than happy to play, to play that role. And then there's, on the flip side, you know, there's times where we've come in and, and, you know, we provide the entire system, right. Of, you know, through audio and video and whatever else that we, that we need to do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, I'm, I want to kind of move away from the technical side and talk a little bit more about, a little more about the design side because, and I will use, again, this Crayola thing that I saw as, as an example. It uses this pouring, pouring paint metaphor, and kids get to run under it and they cup their arms and it pools up, or it splashes off their heads or whatever. And it's great fun, but it's also done in a way that's simple and approachable. So I asked my, I have a 10-year-old boy and my niece who is seven, and I was like, there's this thing, can you go and try and figure it out? And two seconds in, they had it figured out and 10 seconds in they were having fun. And I thought that was amazing because I've had the opportunity to work with people that were attempting to put together like children's experiences, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And they're like, you know, I'm, I'm listening, I'm going through the design cycle with them, and they're like, well, we want it to be educational, and we want it to be colorful, and we want it to have an interesting noise thing and all this kind of stuff. And, you know, they end up developing an extremely complicated thing, then they put it in front of a kid who's like, can't make it through the first of 45 steps. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Right. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And, it's very frustrating to see that in action, especially when, you know, because of the way that design process is going, you have no way to influence it. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You, in, in this in instance, made something that was immediately understandable and immediately fun, but that doesn't come easy. I don't think. I, I think it's, it's hard for people to intuit how simple fun can be 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b><laugh>. Right? No, it's, it's definitely, it's definitely a challenge. And it's, and it's fortunate that I, I figured a lot of that stuff. I was still in academia Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, before I was actually trying to make money off of this. Sure. And, and it, and it, and it is exactly what you're saying. It's, it's, it's, if you're, if you're trying to create an interactive, you know, environment in some way, there's an exchange that's happening, you have to then create a vocabulary of some sort. There has to be some way for you, you know, through, you know, whatever action that you're doing that's gonna affect the space. And the question is, what is that vocabulary? Do you have to have them be fluent in that vocabulary right off the bat, or do you start, you know, with simple things? And, and I learned early on that just getting people, you know, it's, it's funny. I heard a, I heard a great analogy. It's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2153.965" data-end_ts="2154.085" title="2153.965" id=c_"2153.965">__the__</span>, it's the Angry Birds analogy. It's like, it's easy to learn, it takes a lifetime to master. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>And it's, and it's, it's, it is that approach. It was just like, get you hooked in, get you interested, learn the very first, you know, learn how to say, where's the, you know, train station Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know, right off the bat. And, and get something interesting out of it, something that's intriguing. And then almost without realizing it, you start teaching 'em more of the vocabulary that's, you know, needed with this. Right. With the experience. If you set it up immediately that, okay, you're gonna have to learn all these things first for the next half hour, and then we're gonna have fun. It never works. And, and, and like, like you said, we've seen many experiences that are exactly like that, that have, that have failed because of that, that, you know, in the end are <span style="color:red" data-ts="2204.325" data-end_ts="2204.445" title="2204.325" id=c_"2204.325">__a__</span>, you know, could be absolutely brilliant, but if you're not finding a way to engage your audience and, quickly, then, you know, it's all for naught. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Exactly. So what, from your perspective, particularly in terms of design for kids, what is, what is the thing that to you represents sort of like the best work you've done? 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Oh, goodness. I mean, the thing that we're <span style="color:red" data-ts="2235.525" data-end_ts="2235.605" title="2235.525" id=c_"2235.525">__the__</span> probably the most proud of is, our first foray into museum work was the inspector training course, which is a, I guess, best described. It's like a high tech scavenger hunt. It's, it's here at the Discovery Cube in Los Angeles. It's takes place in a 2200 square foot California bungalow house. It is a real house that was built inside this museum. And we were basically brought in to <laugh>, teach the very exciting material of sustainability, home safety and earthquake preparedness to five to 15 year olds. I mean, talk about a tough, you know, oh goodness. A a tough subject material to sell in the end. I mean, it was basically, we try, we, we, we approached it as a performance, you know, it's just like, we gotta get the kids interested in this in some way, you know, that, that engages them in a really interesting way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>We've got to be careful that we're not competing against, you know, all the, you know, because there was, there is like a, you know, a tablet facing component to, to the experience that we weren't competing against all the first person shooter games and all that sort of stuff. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2299.425" data-end_ts="2299.645" title="2299.425" id=c_"2299.425">__And__</span> the thousands of games that are on the iPad, we can't compete with that. We don't have the budget for this is museum work. Right. I think the thing that it was kind of a coming together of all the, all of the concepts that we had learned from themed entertainment, from live performance, from, you know, doing quick one-offs for kids. It was, it was trying to come up with what the approach should be for this. The thing that that stuck and worked the best was you turn into a game, you turn anything into a game, you put points to anything, and the kids are hooked. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I mean, obviously there needs to be more than that, but that was, that became, you know, kind of the backbone to what, what the experience was in the end. I, I think what made us the the most excited was that the kids just, they had a great time going through. It's a 15 minute experience, which was unreal for a museum. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And in the end, they are really excited about what they've accomplished. They're excited about getting their faces on the super inspector wall. And in the end, it's like, almost when they come out, it's like, yay, that was great. And it's like, damn <span style="color:red" data-ts="2365.445" data-end_ts="2365.645" title="2365.445" id=c_"2365.445">__it__</span>, I just learned something <laugh>. And I think that was one of the things that really, you know, that we're the most proud of being able to do, is that we made it fun. We made it entertaining. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>We took subject material that's very important, but very hard for kids of this age, and made it very approachable and entertaining. And the thing that I think is, is even further testament to that, that made us even even happier was, you know, from our friends who have kids that were of, you know, of that age and did the, and did the inspector training course, the kids became tyrants at their house. <laugh> <laugh> they going through. And our son was the same way. I have an 8-year-old, and he was the, he was, you know, I remember the story that was relayed to us. My, my mom was, you know, washing dishes in our sink, and the sun comes into the kitchen and it goes, Grammy, what are you doing? And, you know, yelling, <laugh> yelling at her, you know, scaring the bejesus out of her because she was, you know, being a person from Virginia wasn't quite used to the drought ridden <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Right. The water was running, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2426.505" data-end_ts="2426.725" title="2426.505" id=c_"2426.505">__was__</span> the water was running. And so, so he ended up, not only did he learn it, but he was able to absorb it and then teach it. Right. And this is, you know, he was, what, six and a half, seven years old at the time. So that was, that was crazy. Just that revelation of, of, you know, not only can we, you know, make it entertaining and teach, but then the kids are actually absorbing this or absorbing the material. So it was, and, and I must say that, and to do that, we, we really did pull out all the tricks that we knew it was, you know, what can we bring in from themed entertainment? What can we bring in from live performance and from dance and all these things? And, you know, the importance of touch and, and, you know, physical interaction and, and knowing where you are within the space was actually pretty cool for the kids. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>'cause, you know, nothing would happen until they actually went to the particular locations or, you know, they, you know, if they found what it was, and the fact that there was some omniscient system in the backend that that knew what they were doing. And that, for them, it was really intriguing. Not, again, not that they were focused on that, but the fact that, you know, they were actually playing an intelligent game and having a conversation with the house in some way, that was, that was pretty, that was pretty outstanding. Yeah. So that's, that's, that's one of the pieces that we're super proud about. And, and unfortunately we've won, actually won <span style="color:red" data-ts="2506.325" data-end_ts="2506.445" title="2506.325" id=c_"2506.325">__a__</span> several awards for it too, which is kind of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2508.485" data-end_ts="2508.885" title="2508.485" id=c_"2508.485">__<crosstalk>__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now. One of the things that I'm curious about is, I, I've noticed that a lot of the stuff that you do, it, it's not first order sensing. So it's not like, oh, he's near, so let's make it louder. Oh, he's far, let's make it quieter as much as it's like, this shape will do this thing, or this amount of time will represent this level of commitment, or something like that. Right. You have, there's, it's more complicated, but maybe more subtle approach to interacting with the system. What, is this software or is this conceptual IP that you've designed, or is this something, or is this something off the shelf that you use if it's something that you designed? How hard was that 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b><laugh>? Well, yeah, it's, it is, it started off as our knee jerk reaction to what was originally called, I mean, this is starting in, you know, the late nineties and early two thousands, what was being called? Interactive. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And then for us being, and again, being a, being a musician and knowing what it meant to have an interaction with other, you know, fellow chamber players and stuff like that, that what was being called interactive was definitely not being interactive. I mean, it was, you know, you push a button, something happens, push a button, the same thing happens, push a button, the same thing happens again. Right? And, and so it was that motivation that kind of led, I didn't wanna fall into that trap. So I've always wanted to create a system that was more complicated. But again, going back to what we were originally talking about, where the vocabulary wasn't, you know, overwhelming, you know, off the Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b><affirmative>, you know, off the bat. But there was something that was intriguing. Like, I did this. I pushed that button, something happened. I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2611.285" data-end_ts="2611.445" title="2611.285" id=c_"2611.285">__went__</span>, I came back and I pushed that button again. But something was different. Right. Why was it different? And it made people start to think, and that's what I really wanted, you know, the kind of experiences I wanted to create. Now as far as the tools that existed there weren't basically wrote 'em all. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, it was more of a conceptual, you know, approach and then trying to figure out what to do. I must say that ID everything that I've written, I've written in Max, I can't program in any other language. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2637.265" data-end_ts="2637.485" title="2637.265" id=c_"2637.265">__Wow__</span>. So it was just using those tools <span style="color:red" data-ts="2639.985" data-end_ts="2640.205" title="2639.985" id=c_"2639.985">__and__</span> putting <span style="color:red" data-ts="2640.445" data-end_ts="2640.605" title="2640.445" id=c_"2640.445">__it__</span> together in unique ways. And, and, you know, I, I think with Max it was, I love the way it's set up. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>I, it, it, the way you build and program and, you know, the way you build patches and stuff, how you spatialize everything and compartmentalize stuff. That is very much the way I think. And it's very much the way I approach these experiences. So that environment, both, you know, conceptually of how Max is built and how I wanted to conceptually build <span style="color:red" data-ts="2669.345" data-end_ts="2669.565" title="2669.345" id=c_"2669.345">__and__</span> experience, were very one <span style="color:red" data-ts="2671.285" data-end_ts="2671.445" title="2671.285" id=c_"2671.285">__in__</span> the same Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So basically was, you know, in order to create the stuff that I did, was basically starting to build a toolbox of, you know, how do we, what is it that we're sensing? What is interesting about those particular things that we're sensing? Where's the depth that we can get? Like I said, if you're hitting the same button three times, you shouldn't have the same response, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2688.995" data-end_ts="2689.285" title="2688.995" id=c_"2688.995">__then__</span> obviously you're interested in something. Right. So the environment, the system should give you other information in, in response to that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>So it was creating those tool sets that, that allowed that to happen. Sure. But no, it was, for me, it was just, yeah, it was all, it was all just kind of putting together those tools and finding the right sensing stuff. I mean, most of the stuff, the sensors that we use, most of it's off the shelf. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> stuff that you, you know, you could find it, you know, down the street in the electronic surplus store here, or, you know, spark <span style="color:red" data-ts="2720.325" data-end_ts="2720.605" title="2720.325" id=c_"2720.325">__Fund__</span> or any of those companies. That was started off very simple, but we've also used, you know, $30,000 tracking systems at the same time Sure. To create, you know, the, those kinds of experiences. But, again, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Hopefully on someone else's dime 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b><laugh>. Yeah. Yeah. Seriously. Yeah, <laugh>, it's just for that it was just, you know, just figuring out, I, I think one of the, the things that we kind of realized is that we are great curators of technology, that we're, we're always on top of what the latest thing is and what, you know, what's just coming out. What are cool new sensing things, and we're great at finding them, and then reappropriating for something else that was completely not, like, for instance, that one that you were talking about. Yeah. The sensor that's in there is actually the sensor that was, that's used in missile guidance systems. Fortunately <span style="color:red" data-ts="2767.245" data-end_ts="2767.365" title="2767.245" id=c_"2767.245">__a__</span> considerably cheaper, but it's the exact same technology, the same algorithms. But we just <span style="color:red" data-ts="2771.845" data-end_ts="2771.965" title="2771.845" id=c_"2771.845">__said__</span>, well, let's give it a try. And throwing that sensor inside that wand, we know within a degree of where that wand is pointing at all times. So, you know, there's those tools that give you the, and, and I must say it's those tools that actually afford us the capability to get more complex dialogues going Right. And exchanges going with the, with the guests and the performers. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So in terms of like all the different technologies that you, that you inter you have to use in order to put together an experience, what in your experience is like the most fragile of the technologies? Is it the computers themselves? Is it the sensors or wireless radios? Or what, what are the fragile parts of putting together these complex systems? 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Probably the sensors, I would say. Particularly if you put the sensors in the hands of anybody <laugh> else beside, beside you, of course. I think that's the part that, you don't realize how much abuse it will immediately take, particularly if you're doing work for themed entertainment stuff, even museums. It was crazy. We did, last year it was a favor for, museum in, in town. We built a, a full scale, operation game table. Yeah. Okay. <laugh>. And, it was kind of our first foray into, I mean, we obviously built a lot of prototypes and, you know, quick, you know, quick and dirty, things that we would need props and, you know, structures and things like that, that we would need for an experience. But we're never building the end thing, usually <laugh>. But this time we did, and it was crazy, within maybe an hour of it being installed, there was a five-year-old dancing on top of the table <laugh>. And it's like, how do you, how do you design for that? So it, that 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Wasn't <span style="color:red" data-ts="2882.205" data-end_ts="2882.245" title="2882.205" id=c_"2882.205">__in__</span> the 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Plan, right? It wasn't, it wasn't in the plan. It's like all this, fortunately, I guess the still worked after that, but it was like one of those things, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2888.245" data-end_ts="2888.445" title="2888.245" id=c_"2888.245">__it__</span> was just like, quick, we gotta get outta this building. It <span style="color:red" data-ts="2889.925" data-end_ts="2890.005" title="2889.925" id=c_"2889.925">__was__</span> like, I don't <span style="color:red" data-ts="2890.405" data-end_ts="2890.485" title="2890.405" id=c_"2890.405">__want__</span> <laugh>, I don't wanna be responsible for that. I think that's probably one of the most fragile, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2895.785" data-end_ts="2896.005" title="2895.785" id=c_"2895.785">__so__</span> the most fragile part is, is anything that you're putting in the hands of anybody. We've fortunately, 'cause we've been doing this for so long, the CPUs, we, you know, it's, we, we know we build our own usually with CPUs. And so we know what we're getting and what we're getting ourselves into and what works and what doesn't. So those usually aren't terribly fragile. I think with the approach that we always take is everything's very modular, very nodal. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And so it gets much easier to, you know, track down problems and issues that we, that we'd have. So if there is something that is delicate, it's easy to find and fix and, and stuff. But, yeah, really the bottom line is anything you put in anyone's hands, you're, you're screwed. <laugh>. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's hilarious. So you actually, admit to being kind of a, a bit of a cool hunter when it comes to devices and technology. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What is the thing that's just, just around the corner that seems the most exciting to you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Oh goodness. I mean, that's kind of funny. 'cause we're at the moment <span style="color:red" data-ts="2960.825" data-end_ts="2961.045" title="2960.825" id=c_"2960.825">__not__</span> I'm really <span style="color:red" data-ts="2961.825" data-end_ts="2962.045" title="2961.825" id=c_"2961.825">__cur__</span> All right. The thing I'm really curious about is what VR <span style="color:red" data-ts="2964.185" data-end_ts="2964.405" title="2964.185" id=c_"2964.185">__is__</span> gonna end up doing. Mm-Hmm. We have had this ebb and flow of virtual reality and how it's gonna be used. Yeah. It comes and goes, you know, we've done, you know, headsets before, we've done cave environments, and, and I mean, I actually worked for several years at UCLA in this visualization portal thing, which was another VR space. I think the thing that we're really looking closely at is what's gonna happen now, especially with, you know, Oculus and all the other things that are coming out. There's gesture gloves that are, you know, there's dozens and dozens of those being made. It's not just the technology that is interesting. It's, it's the use. I think, I think that's really where it's gonna become interesting is, is are we really going to become isolated beings and look at these things and, you know, look at our world through headsets, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Or are people gonna come up with really interesting ways of, of using that to augment, you know, our physical space in some way? And I, I think that's, that's one of the things that's really intriguing me right now, is trying to figure that out both with, this is probably gonna go away with a feeling <span style="color:red" data-ts="3029.125" data-end_ts="3029.285" title="3029.125" id=c_"3029.125">__of__</span> this is probably gonna go away again. Or, and also with the feeling it was like, well, this could actually end up being something cool if, if we've answered, you know, some of those issues of, of isolationism and all that sort of stuff Yeah. Of, of, you know, that kind of technology. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and again, we end up with your desire to be an adjunct instead of a replacement. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Yeah. There you go. <laugh> bringing it all full circle. Indeed. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, Dave, thank you so much again for your time. This is a really fascinating insight into what you do and how you kind of approach things. I think it's really cool to get to see inside of people's heads like that. So, but my time is up. Thank you so much for spending the time and for being willing to talk about this stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Oh, please. I had a great time. Thank you so much for asking me. And, hopefully the journey into my head wasn't too treacherous, <laugh>. Oh, no, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's awesome. It was, it was really a lot of fun. Thank you so much. Have a great day, man. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Thank you, Darwin Take care. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Many thanks to David for the fantastic interview. I always like talking to people that are that excited about the work that they do. Many thanks also to you, the listeners, for continuing to stick with me through, this journey. Can't believe we've done over 130 podcasts, and I'm looking forward to hopefully doing that many, in many more over the coming years. So keep listening, keep on telling people about the podcast, and I'll catch you next weekend. Bye.
