<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. It's, the day after Valentine's Day. All the people at Sherry's Berries and one <span style="color:red" data-ts="14.16" data-end_ts="14.48" title="14.16" id=c_"14.16">__800__</span> flowers.com and all these other places that advertise obsessively prior to, Hallmark's favorite day are going to be able to take the chance to sleeping late. But not us. We've got a new podcast this time with an amazing character, an amazing person, and somebody who's on fire. I hope you enjoy this interview with Sam Botstein 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright. Today I have the, the pleasure of introducing somebody to you who you've pro, whose voice you probably heard. If you listen to this podcast, I hope that you are also tuning into another podcast called The Distillery. It's run by Samuel Botstein, or as we like to call him, Sam, apparently, those of us who listen to him in our head. Sam does a, does a podcast called The Distillery. It's really focused on music makers in sort of the modular <span style="color:red" data-ts="74.68" data-end_ts="74.88" title="74.68" id=c_"74.68">__and__</span>, and analog, electronic space. But recently, he's also, done some interesting things. I met up with him at namm. This is, it's where we kind of got the idea of getting him on the podcast, ran it <span style="color:red" data-ts="88.92" data-end_ts="89.04" title="88.92" id=c_"88.92">__to__</span> at namm because he's also started a little modular company that's doing kind of an interesting thing that I'll let him talk about. So, with that, let's say hi. Hey, Sam. How's it going? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam Botstein: </b>Hey, Darwin It's going really well. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm all right. It's that time of year, so I have a little frog in my throat, so if I cough a little bit extra, we'll just hope that I remember to edit it out. So, you are apparently really stinking busy, based on what I saw at namm. You have a scary amount of stuff you're in the middle of. So why don't we kick this off by having you explain all the different things that you do? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Excellent. So, a lot of your listeners probably know me from hosting my own show called The Distillery. The Distillery is a music technology interview podcast. I'm embarrassed to say that I did not know about your podcast when I started it, and I might've tried harder to make it a little more, different from it. But, essentially, ultimately, I was aware of, <span style="color:red" data-ts="154.4" data-end_ts="154.56" title="154.4" id=c_"154.4">__and__</span> yet another podcast called Waveform City, hosted by our friend Bryce. And I just sort of thought, man, I would be asking some different questions, <laugh>. So, you know, ultimately even, you know, there are people that all three of us have spoken to on our own shows, and it's all different stuff, you know, with not a lot of overlap. So the distillery is really all about learning a little bit more about the people behind all the, you know, nerdy music technology stuff we love. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>And also, just figuring out what it takes to actually do all that stuff, whether it's making the gear or the music or, you know, any behind the scenes stuff. And the other thing is I also like to talk to people as much as I can, all over sort of the strata of people who work in this field. So I don't want to just talk to, you know, the c e o of a company. I'd equally love to talk to someone who's like, you know, has a starting level position or whatever, because it's really tough if you're not already in the industry to first of all, break in and second of all to sort of know what to expect. So it's been an amazing learning experience for me, both the stuff that I get on air and off air, and, I'm, I'm just delighted that other people listen to it as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Sure. So, it's interesting that you talk about getting into the industry because, it is, it, while it has historically been difficult, it seems like there's no better time than the present. I can't remember a time since like the mid eighties where you could just kind of put on a hat and say, I am in business, in the music business, in the music technology business. And, you, a couple of episodes ago you started talking about your new company that you've started. Can you tell us a little bit about that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Right. So essentially I'll tell the story when you ask me about my background, which I know you're <span style="color:red" data-ts="277.23" data-end_ts="277.31" title="277.23" id=c_"277.23">__gonna__</span> do <laugh>. Okay. But, I, I met, my great friend, rich, he is, is best known as dj, hard <span style="color:red" data-ts="284.35" data-end_ts="284.59" title="284.35" id=c_"284.35">__Rich__</span>. And essentially he and I really wanted to work together, and we had lots and lots of ideas, but I arrived on the idea of, Hey, I really want to make a Eurorack sampler. And so I sold Rich on the idea of Eurorack. You know, I showed him my big Euro system that I already had at that time. And, he's the ultimate sampler nerd, so I thought I knew a lot about it. But he, I think he owns every single vintage and Sonic sampler and, he and DJ Kubert, who for, with whom we work really quite a lot, especially Rich. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>We've have every single vintage sampler represented, I think. So we tried to build something that would essentially fill in a lot of the sort of missing workflow things that we really wanted. And as we were building this, it just sort of grew and grew and my sort of self-styled Steve Jobsian demand for quality. And, Rich's, immense knowledge of not only sampling, but to all of the sort of technical side on the digital side of things, led us to do three and four hardware revisions until we essentially had, a module that was able to do way more than sampling. Sure. So we called that module Emperor, and we brought a functional prototype to the NAMM Show a couple weeks ago. And essentially what emperor is, is a very powerful brain for a Euro system. The <span style="color:red" data-ts="387.11" data-end_ts="387.4" title="387.11" id=c_"387.11">__show__</span> floor model we brought had a core I five processor, a quad core core i five processor in it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>It had a high resolution touch capacitive display on it, and it had <span style="color:red" data-ts="399.92" data-end_ts="400.14" title="399.92" id=c_"399.92">__six__</span>, 32 JAKs on it, 16 of which were for eight audio ins and outs, which were at 24 bits, 192 kilohertz, and eight of which were CV inputs and outputs. So, right away on the show floor, we were showing things like sampling into native instruments, machine software, with, you know, the hardware controller that we brought, and we were doing things like showing certain modules as insert effects and others as effect sends. And we were sampling right from the modular and everything. And I, I think that, once we got into showing, some other things, like we showed reactor patches including System 63, which, from Romans audio, which actually includes models of, physical euro eurorack modules. So you can get sort of like an inception shot, right. <laugh> where you have them side by side and, you know, Maxim s p stuff, and Right. A lot of people really saw the value in it. And as, as we, predicted that we got a lot of advanced Hatter stuff Oh, of course. Which was really cool. I, I think that it's, it's interesting to see how passionately people reacted to it either way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Yeah. Well, I think, I, I think it's actually pretty, pretty ama pretty amazing what you did. I mean, I, I saw it and I was like, alright, there have been many modules that have been crowned the Uber module mm-hmm. <affirmative>, but I think that you have defined what the Uber module is going to be. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>At least I've raised the bar. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Yeah, definitely raised the bar. It was amazing to see that, and amazing to see it, it operating the way it was. So that was really cool. So, you dropped a whole bunch of nuggets there that I can't help but, scoop up. So let's, let's take the jaunt into that background discussion. Okay. Because, between talking about samplers and talking about Bert and talking about all these other things, there's obviously some tales to be told. So why don't you give me your background and how you've gotten to be where you are now? 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Okay. Well, I'm classically trained very thoroughly, classically trained. My parents are scientists, but, my father's brother, Leon Botstein is a musician, as well as a college president. And essentially my extended family and my new, my whole family could tell that I had some sort of, spark of musical talent or something in that I was able to carry a tune from a very, very, very young age. So I was, made to start playing the violin in the Suzuki method, which, did not exactly work out for me. That was about, I must've been about three years old. And then, you know, after a very short hiatus, I, I really wanted to go to this school in California, in the Bay Area called the Neva School. And, my parents convinced me, that I had to play an instrument to be admitted to this school. Okay. That, that's not true <laugh>, but I'm glad that they did that. And I've been playing the trumpet ever since. Oh. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Parents are notorious liars. I'm a parent, and so I know <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Oh, I mean, I, I'm, I'm glad they did it. You know, I, there's no hard feelings there. Sure, sure. So, I played the trumpet constantly. I wish I practiced more, but you know, as a kid, you know, whatcha gonna do. But essentially this opened up a lot of opportunities, and I remember, I must've been six or seven when the story took place and authority figure at, <span style="color:red" data-ts="625.55" data-end_ts="625.77" title="625.55" id=c_"625.55">__Eva__</span> School said something like, oh, you know, we're gonna invite you to play all these different kinds of things. All you have to do is say yes. And sort of went, oh, okay. So, you know, I said, yes, and I would play at this event and that event and wherever. And, I really gained a lot of confidence in terms of life performance and, really a lot of playing experience from a very young age. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>E eventually, we moved across the country. My father moved from Stanford to Princeton, so we moved to the Princeton, Princeton, New Jersey. And I went through essentially all of the local music opportunities you could do there. I played in this youth orchestra and that youth orchestra. And, you know, I played fourth the trumpet and eventually played principal trumpet in each of these. And, I sort of became clear that I would have to start looking a little bit farther, for more musical opportunities. So, it really came down to either going into New York City every weekend to study at, you know, Manhattan School of Music or Julliard on the weekends. Right. Or, I had gone to Interlochen Arts Camp and, after, you know, much debate, my parents made it possible for me to go to Interlochen Arts Academy. So I went there, and there, I had kind of a mixed experience. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>I, I don't usually talk about it a lot, but, I certainly learned what it means to be serious in terms of, you know, if you're going to actually do this, you're gonna go to college for music and then be a professional musician. Right. And, <span style="color:red" data-ts="724.58" data-end_ts="724.8" title="724.58" id=c_"724.58">__the__</span>, the other really notable thing was I studied with Ken Larsson, who not only is a fantastic, player and teacher, but also makes some of the best trumpets in the world. And, I learned a lot about making trumpets, but also just sort of the value of instruments and sort of what it means to make them Sure. In terms of like, the lifestyle and, sort of what's required in terms of technical know-how versus, like personal aesthetic. So it made a really big impression on me. And then the, the, the very last thing I'll say about Interlochen, is that I went for four years, which is, relatively rare. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>And in fact, students at Interlochen like to have their own internal mythology about how oh, four years will drive you insane, or whatever, <laugh>. And yeah, it gives you sort of like a, a weird, status, at least like a footnote in the back of people's minds that like, oh, he's a four year or whatever. Right. So those things really made a big impression on me. I started going to college at Bard College, immediately afterward, there a lot of things happened in close succession. So right before starting Bard, I attended the International Trumpet Seminar of the Center for Advanced Musical Study at Chosen Veil, which is, it's really hard to explain what that actually is, but it's basically a meeting of the trumpet Illuminati. Okay. It's, I can't explain it a much better than that, but what I really learned there is that there's way more to do with the trumpet than the Midwestern pedagogical mafiaa. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>What have you believe? I saw performances by <span style="color:red" data-ts="830.1" data-end_ts="830.52" title="830.1" id=c_"830.1">__Marcus__</span> Stockhausen, son of Carl Hines, who, really has an incredible approach to improvisational music and a very, very deep relationship, of course, with his father's music. I, saw performances by people like <span style="color:red" data-ts="848.13" data-end_ts="848.48" title="848.13" id=c_"848.13">__Hocon__</span> Hardenberger and Mark Gould, and people like this, and also people who were much more out than, than even Marcus. Like, Peter Evans, who's a sort of New York based, experimental jazz musician who plays a lot with, electronics. Yes. And I also, saw performances by people who specialize in what I would describe as extreme technique or extreme extended technique like Paul <span style="color:red" data-ts="879.9" data-end_ts="880.32" title="879.9" id=c_"879.9">__Hubner__</span>, played just impossible pieces where you're blowing in the two trumpets at the same time and just all kinds of stuff, while buckets of water are involved. And <laugh>, you know, I, I just, it, it, you know, it was just incredible and amazing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>So I, I went there for two years and I was among, I was not the youngest to ever go that my title probably belongs to my great friend, Baldwin sson. But, the second year I went, I had started studying with Ed Carroll, who is involved with California Nstitute of the Arts. He's been the brass program coordinator there for many years, and who, runs the Chosen Veil. And before that, the, the Lake Placid program. And Ed encouraged me to play this piece, which involved, trumpet and Max M S P. So that was really the first time that I had to use Max in a serious way. I was aware of it before, but I had to actually perform in a masterclass with this Max Patch. And, a spoiler alert, the patch did not work, of course, for the Performance <laugh>. So, so, you know, I, I learned really a lot through that experience. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>And I think during my first or second year of college, I went out to visit my father who was on sabbatical from Princeton in back in the Bay Area. We stayed in sort of the, the newest development part of, San Francisco Right. Where, U C Ss F is sort of building out all their new stuff. Right. We stayed in graduate school housing, which was incredibly nice for graduate school housing <laugh>. Yeah. And, I had come out there for so long, you know, at, at Bard College we have this, like a lot of New England schools. We have a giant winter intercession. I think it's almost six weeks long at this point. And that dates back to when we didn't want to heat the place in the Winter <laugh>. Anyway, so I, I went out for this entire break to see, see my father out there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>And I had a internship, or actually I think it was supposed to be a real job, lined up with, let's say a less than reputable, music instruments company based in San Francisco. And, on the plane out there, I got a call from somebody at the company who said, oh, we have no money. Sorry, it's off. So I, I got on the Bart and I went over to Berkeley, where I had gotten a meeting with somebody at Keith <span style="color:red" data-ts="1027.64" data-end_ts="1028.04" title="1027.64" id=c_"1027.64">__Millon__</span> Instruments, I believe Matt Ick. Right. I, I said that I knew how to program, which was true. 'cause I, I had learned through working in my dad's lab, and essentially, I was kind of feeling <laugh>. It was silly, but I was sort of feeling kind of like down and out because I was out of this job. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Right. And, Keith McMillan gave me a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1048.6" data-end_ts="1048.72" title="1048.6" id=c_"1048.6">__q__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1048.8" data-end_ts="1048.92" title="1048.8" id=c_"1048.8">__o__</span> and an internship. So, that, that was a huge, impression on me. I really learned really a lot quickly, what they had essentially brought me in to do was port over all of the control service scripts, which are written in Python between Ableton Live eight and Ableton Live nine. Sure. And when Ableton introduced Live, live Nine and Push, there was maybe sort of an interesting political move in that, you know, they had been working with these different hardware partners prior to that. And, there was no backward compatibility really, between the two control service script things. And I, I'll say for the record, I don't really know how good of a job I did at that while I was there, but I definitely learned really, really a ton. It was there that I learned the power of Max M s P. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Essentially everyone who had been working in the room I was in at Keith McMillan was, a huge Max M s P had nerd whatever. Especially people like Connor Lacey who, oh my, yeah. Who heads up their, software development. Right. And I also got the idea into my head that I had to go to Cal Arts or Mills. If you look at the, <laugh>, if you look at the Keith McMillan website and you find, you know, the list of people who work there <span style="color:red" data-ts="1124.64" data-end_ts="1124.76" title="1124.64" id=c_"1124.64">__in__</span> the little bios or whatever, you'll notice that almost everybody who went to Kel Arts Mills or both. Right. So that sort of brings me to, discovery that I was really, really into a kind of music which involves turnt ableism and emphasizes it over, say like a rapper or even the beats being played, really. It's just sort of all about the scratching. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>And I became aware of this place in New York on 14th Street called Dubs <span style="color:red" data-ts="1150.6" data-end_ts="1150.72" title="1150.6" id=c_"1150.6">__Spot__</span>. And, I didn't, I've never taken a Dubs <span style="color:red" data-ts="1153.6" data-end_ts="1153.72" title="1153.6" id=c_"1153.6">__spot__</span> class, I have to admit. But essentially, I knew of DJ Shifty who had recently won the, B M C World Championship. Right. Which is probably, you know, the highest profile turntables prize you could ever win. Two years prior to that, he had, brought home, first New York in a long time to bring home the World Battle title, which I, I think at this point, the D M C is unironically calling the Battle for World Supremacy, which I have to say is, pretty cool. I, I knew, I knew of Shifty and, I said, Hey, can I take a private lesson? And, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1190.83" data-end_ts="1191.12" title="1190.83" id=c_"1190.83">__depo__</span> said, of course. And I couldn't believe it, you know, for <span style="color:red" data-ts="1194.56" data-end_ts="1194.68" title="1194.56" id=c_"1194.56">__a__</span> x amount of dollars. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>It was not only possible, but easy to go meet, you know, this person that you really looked up to. Right. And I, I was also really wrapped up in Schiff's story, like me, he's actually named Sam, he's sort of a New York Jewish kid, and by sort <span style="color:red" data-ts="1209.36" data-end_ts="1209.48" title="1209.36" id=c_"1209.36">__of__</span>, I mean absolutely a New York Jewish kid, <laugh>, and, you know, like people like a track. He had actually gotten his first pair of turntables as his Bar mitzvah present. So, I, I had, you know, I, I had the whole narrative of it was very meaningful for me. He taught me how to do some scratching and beat juggling. And if you had told me at that time that, you know, a couple years later I'd be working with DJ Hubert, on a regular basis, I, you know, I would never have believed that, this really stuck with me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>And while I was learning a lot about electronic music in school, mostly more academic subjects like Stockhouse or Pierre Schafer's, or these other people's electronic music, I was really interested in, you know, how can I get turntable <span style="color:red" data-ts="1250.4" data-end_ts="1250.6" title="1250.4" id=c_"1250.4">__with__</span> involved with this? So, I learned a lot at Bard in my first two years, but during that time, I, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1259.74" data-end_ts="1259.96" title="1259.74" id=c_"1259.74">__it__</span> became aware of Brian Crabtree and, Kelly Cain of, I, I, I knew I somehow I figured out that they were living in the Catskills. Right. You know, maybe they changed <span style="color:red" data-ts="1271.28" data-end_ts="1271.44" title="1271.28" id=c_"1271.28">__the__</span> head around their site or something. Right. And I had wanted a, a mono since I could remember. You know, it was just growing up. For, for me, it was just a really big part of the zeitgeist. And that, you know, Bjork had one on stage at one point, and dead <span style="color:red" data-ts="1286.2" data-end_ts="1286.44" title="1286.2" id=c_"1286.2">__Mouse__</span>, and people like this. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>And, I, I had known historically that it had been kind of difficult to get a grid that, they usually sold out on the first day. Right. And, you know, I couldn't exactly afford that at as a teenager, which is very reasonable. And I somehow, I'm, I'm not, I'm not encouraging anybody to do this. I somehow invited myself over to the house, <laugh>, I'm not exactly sure, I'm sure I can look up what I said in the email, but I said something like, Hey, I live in the area. I wanna know more about what this is all about. And I really <span style="color:red" data-ts="1319.22" data-end_ts="1319.44" title="1319.22" id=c_"1319.22">__got__</span>, really look up to you guys, can I, come over for a meeting? You know, I have this internship with Keith McMillan and whatever, and long story short, after much back and forth, 'cause you know, they, they have stuff to do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>They're, they're busy. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, I eventually went there and was one of like the best days of my life. <laugh>, I'm sure they're, they'd be appalled to hear this, but, I was absolutely captivated with everything Brian and Kelly said. And, if you've ever been to their place, it, it, everything belongs in <span style="color:red" data-ts="1352.6" data-end_ts="1352.8" title="1352.6" id=c_"1352.6">__this__</span> in a design magazine. It looks exactly the way that you would think, you know, based on the look of the mono stuff. And it was just like seeing 5, 10, 15 years into the future, you know, I, I had by that point a like quasi encyclopedic knowledge of every controller everybody was selling at that time. Right. And just sort of see, this beautiful workshop, which Brian, had just completed for his barn. He showed me things like, at that point they had figured out, how to do sort of modular circuit boards and that a 64 grid and a 128 grid. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>So essentially a 100 a, 128 grid was just 2 64 grid boards put together. Right. And I sort of, this really made a big impression on me, in terms of, oh, you know, so this is how you make stuff. You know, <laugh>, if only I knew that they made like the mo the highest quality, you know what I mean? I had no idea that theirs was by far, you know, the biggest thing ever. I, I sort of figured out, based on asking Brian about it, that all of the stuff I loved, like the APC 40 or the Novation Launchpad or whatever, was really a kind of like a rip-off of their grid idea. And a lot of these controllers really missed the point of the sort of decoupled nature of the device. And the other thing that really made a big impression on me there was they had things like a teenage engineering op one lying around <laugh> in the beginnings of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1446.88" data-end_ts="1447" title="1446.88" id=c_"1446.88">__a__</span> Euro system, and actually spilled the beans, sort of showed me what would later become the olive. Right. And I was, I was beyond mind blown. Right. Drove back with some of their eggs from, from their chickens. And I a lot to think about. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>My, yeah. So before you go on, for those listening who think that the best opportunity to get a mono grid is to call up Brian and Kelly, invite yourself over, I think at this point now, you'll be invited over, but you'll also be required to shovel goat shit for a day before you get to talk to anyone. So I'm just, <laugh> gonna throw that warning out there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Oh, to be clear, they, they didn't give me a grid, <laugh>. They did, they did. They did give me eggs, though. It <span style="color:red" data-ts="1493.64" data-end_ts="1493.68" title="1493.64" id=c_"1493.64">__was__</span> much appreciated. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1494.16" data-end_ts="1494.32" title="1494.16" id=c_"1494.16">__They__</span>, they were absolutely delicious. I would later go back, I, I got invited to a, an, an event there, in which I saw a lot of really interesting people play with different, you know, mono apps and controllers and things like that. My, my work with Youth McMillan actually turned into a actual job. I decided to go out to Cal Arts for a year. And again, I sort of talked myself into this. There is no exchange program between Bard College and, California issues of the arts. And it is kind of weird to take a year abroad within the same country. You know, it was, it was complicated to work out. But essentially I was able to spend a year at Cal Arts. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>I became the Keith Millon product representative for Los Angeles. And, I, I learned a ton through that experience. Really met a lot of really interesting people. And around this time, not to be a downer on your podcast, I, but it is important that it was sort of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1549.84" data-end_ts="1549.92" title="1549.84" id=c_"1549.84">__a__</span> big turning point for me. It was, I was diagnosed with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, which is a super aggressive and rare form of cancer. And I, it might've been reasonable to take some time off of school or something. Maybe it would've been an overreaction, but I did. I did not. So, the reason I bring this up is through working at Keith McMillan and going to school at Cal Arts and doing some other work, I did like instructional videos and stuff at the time, on top of my radiation treatments. I sort of learned what it meant to work hard and to sort of manage time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>And that's how I'm able to do so many different insane projects. 'cause compared to that academic year at Cal Arts, it's like I'm <span style="color:red" data-ts="1594.36" data-end_ts="1594.44" title="1594.36" id=c_"1594.36">__doing__</span>, it's like a walk in the park now. So that brings me to, a year ago today, my friend from Chosen Vale Trent Austin, was able to finagle me a NAMM badge, shout out to me all Adams of Adams musical instruments. And I was able to go to namm, which is an overwhelming experience just in and of itself, because trade shows are loud. But a trade show about music tech is just like guaranteed to be crazy, loud and big. You know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Insanity. That's 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Right. Insanity. And, you know, it's, it's worth mentioning that at this point for my cancer treatment, I was on at least six different meds. So I, I think that I was just, just in a crazy state. But I, I made sure to go down to <span style="color:red" data-ts="1638.92" data-end_ts="1639.2" title="1638.92" id=c_"1638.92">__Holly__</span> and see all of the cool synthesizer stuff. 'cause at, at that point, that's where every everything cool was really in <span style="color:red" data-ts="1644.76" data-end_ts="1644.96" title="1644.76" id=c_"1644.76">__Holly__</span> E. And, at that point, I started a Euro system. And this is where I actually met Rich. So Rich had come out from, Indiana. He'd been working at Thud Rumble, which is DJ Bert's, label and company. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>And so, I'll, I'll tell the story the way that I remember it, but there's a, I recently learned an important piece of information, which really changes it. So maybe you can experience this with me. On the last day of the show, I think I went all four days. I, was walking back to my car and I've run into this guy who has a thud Rumble hat and a Thud Rumble shirt, and his badge <span style="color:red" data-ts="1679.44" data-end_ts="1679.64" title="1679.44" id=c_"1679.44">__just__</span> thud Rumble. And I went, whoa, you work for a thud? That's crazy. I had no idea that people worked for Thud. I thought it was just sort of another name for DJ Kubert. And he goes, oh, you work for Keith McMillan. That's so awesome. He's like, oh, we're working on cool turntables. I go, I'm working on this cool turntable. It has CV inputs, and you're able to do like, through zero frequency modulation on the physical motion of the platter and stuff. And we exchanged infor information, and that's sort of how my partnership, partnership with Rich began. But I learned recently, rich admitted to me that I had been blabbing about the school project in which I was doing like a CD turntable. Right. Just to whoever would listen at NAMM <laugh>, and it got it. And stuff gets around that show so fast. Oh, it's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Unreal. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>It's, it's crazy. And the, I mean, I probably would have died if he had told me this, but, you know, the two greatest Scratch <span style="color:red" data-ts="1730.94" data-end_ts="1731.16" title="1730.94" id=c_"1730.94">__DJ__</span> of all time these styles in Kubert, had heard of my CV turntable before, you know, I had ever even thought that I might have met them at the show or whatever. Right. So Rich is just so good at following all the stuff that he hunted me down outside of the convention center to talk to me so that 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>He could bump into you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Yeah. Yeah. Right. So, <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>You know, I eventually finished up this crazy time at Cal <span style="color:red" data-ts="1757.88" data-end_ts="1758.12" title="1757.88" id=c_"1757.88">__Arts__</span>, which brings us up to, I guess, last summer. And, you know, after sort of taking care of some details that I hadn't been, I called up Rich and, we've been working together ever since. So that sort of takes us through all of the background stuff that we were doing. I, I, I definitely think that those experiences were really important to highlight because, you, I think it's important to find your own way into this stuff. There isn't really any formula to go, oh, you know, you know, I, I like to think that there is, you know, people say, well, how do I learn more about this stuff? And I go, okay, sign up for muffler.com. You know? Right. But it, it really is more than that. I think that you have to do a lot of I r l, you know, in, in real life meet space, things to actually get there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>I, I think that's true. And I think, I think also the, the concept that there's no, that there's no straight path through this stuff is really, really important. You know, now it's for people looking to sort of develop a career, develop a business or whatever mm-hmm. <affirmative>, they look at people doing these different things and, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1826.48" data-end_ts="1826.64" title="1826.48" id=c_"1826.48">__are__</span>, and, you know, will come and say, how do I get a life or a business or a career like yours? And, you know, it's like, you don't want to say, well, start off failing at Suzuki violin, and then Oh, sure. Pick up the trumpet and then go to crazy illuminati trumpet meetings while also becoming fascinated with turntables. Right. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>You should become fascinated with turntables and go to peace Trump <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>I'll, yeah. I, I, I have to admit that those both sound pretty awesome. Yeah. <laugh>, but, now one of the things I'm curious about, well, first of all, let me just, let's just talk about the elephant in the room here. So the, this lymphoma diagnosis, oh yeah. How serious is it? I mean, do you, is it something that you have under control? How worried should I be for you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Okay, well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Because here's, here's my, here's my gift to the podcast listeners. I did not know this, 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>So, oh, okay. Well, it's very serious. Non huskins lymphoma of any type is, you know, a pretty heavy diagnosis. It's certainly, you know, life threatening. And in terms of how under control do I have it, I'm not technically in remission, so I am undergoing chemotherapy right now. But, you know, you can sort of tell from how I'm doing that my general health otherwise is great. You know what I mean? It's not like I'm also, it's not like I have separate, you know, health issues. Right. So it, I mean, not in any kind of like dire situation, but it is definitely something that I have to take really seriously. And I had to, you know, take some lifestyle considerations into account. So, I'm, I'm very careful about, for example, how much alcohol I use. And, in the middle of the week, you know, surrounding my, the day I, I do chemo and the day surrounding, I, I don't drink at all, but these are all really relatively minor things compared to the radiation that I had to go through at first. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>So it's, it's, it's fine. I, I'm going to live a long time, you know, probably there's no accounting for, you know, getting hit by a bus or whatever. Right. But, it, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1957.76" data-end_ts="1957.92" title="1957.76" id=c_"1957.76">__it__</span>, this isn't something where I have 10 days to live. I, I'm, I'm fine, you know, but it, it is different. And typically people who have this disease are quite a bit older mm-hmm. <affirmative>. So it's, it's, you know, relatively unusual to have a 21 year old CT c l patient. It's just something that takes seriously. Please support the l l s, the Leukemia Lymphoma Society. I really appreciate everybody's support there. And, I wish that we had a, a date and venue to promote right now, but our friends, you know, hard, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1985.24" data-end_ts="1985.52" title="1985.24" id=c_"1985.24">__rich__</span>, and I, and DJ Kubert and everybody are going to do, you know, some L L Ss fundraiser shows, soon, which I, I'll take this opportunity to plug. I, I bring it up, not because I like to burden people with this information, but because it, it really made a huge difference in terms of my growing up and getting serious and stuff be, before that I was really kind of, doing, going with the flow a little bit more. Like, oh, working for Keith Millon. Cool. And then after that, you know, I really had to plan everything out. 'cause I just don't have as much flexibility, you know, compared to the typical 21 year old guy. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>It seems like at that point then you, you no longer have the luxury of having a cavalier attitude about life. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>I think I'm, I think I can be overly cavalier still <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Well, that's nice. <laugh>. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>I, it's, I think it's okay to have a, I don't know, I've always been kind of an intense kid. Right. And, my parents have always been kind of intense, you know, they're not like chill or lack of physical people necessarily. Sure. I, I just think that the way that I dealt with it was to thrust myself into doing way too much work. So, like, know when, if you go, if you, you know, go to YouTube and you search for Sam Botstein or whatever, and you find some machine tutorial video, just know that I'm like strung out on chemotherapy while I'm trying to explain how to do poly rhythm or whatever. That it's, it was, there was really a lot of double tasking and Right. There was a lot of eating in the car, sitting on the 4 0 5. There was a lot of, there was, to be honest, like a lot of that year was spent sitting on the 4 0 5. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Let's move on from that. Okay. I appreciate you taking it head on and, and Sure. Filling us in. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Yeah. So I have to tell you that I'm blown away that your interaction with Rich is, a year old because I listened to the distillery interview that you did with them. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, it, I would've guessed that you guys had been, had become friends, like in middle school. It has that kind of dinner tenor to it. It has a tenor of like, people who are incredibly comfortable with each other's background. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Oh, that, that's, that's so funny to hear because between meeting at NAMM and that podcast recording, rich and I had essentially zero interaction. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>That's unreal. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>So, but, but I, we definitely get got one another right away. Do you know what I mean? Like Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Oh, sure. I mean, you, you had interests that were shared at a very deep level. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Oh, sure. Sure. And you know, the other thing was is that I really respond well to people who are kind of living something, right? So, like, it seems to me, that, you know, Brian and Kelly of Mono are really living, their whole thing, you know what I mean? That, that it's, it's an all encompassing kind of deal. I mean, maybe they wouldn't, maybe they don't think that and don't appreciate that. I think that, but Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>No, I think that they absolutely appreciate that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2156.3" data-end_ts="2156.52" title="2156.3" id=c_"2156.3">__It__</span>, you know, I, I don't wanna speak for people, but, rich is definitely living this turntable <span style="color:red" data-ts="2161.8" data-end_ts="2162.04" title="2161.8" id=c_"2161.8">__some__</span> thing. So, you know, right now, he's probably at work at Thud Rumble, and then, you know, he'll probably go to bed for briefly before getting up at around midnight to go make beats with DJ Hubert from like midnight until eight. And then at 9:00 AM he starts over again. You know, it's pretty clear that he's all in on this stuff. And I, I, I really respect that kind of thing. I, I've always had an issue with people who are like, oh, I think I can do what you do because I own a guitar. You know, it's not the same thing. <laugh> and, at Interlochen, you know, and still now, you know, I'm still in school. Right. And I definitely have a respect. I should probably just tell these people that I respect them, but <span style="color:red" data-ts="2207.14" data-end_ts="2207.36" title="2207.14" id=c_"2207.14">__the__</span>, these people who, you know, practice six, seven hours a day or whatever, I, I understand what they're doing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>It's their life, you know? And I, I think that Rich and I sort of understood that on a certain level. I, I definitely saw that, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2222.1" data-end_ts="2222.32" title="2222.1" id=c_"2222.1">__you__</span> know, I, at some point, in my adolescence, I tried to make some iPhone apps and stuff, and none of them were really a success. But Rich makes all these different apps for Thud Rumble. And so he had succeeded where I had failed, and it was so clear that he was on like, a whole nother level in terms of programming and the digital side of things. Right. And he, and he sort of knew that through the distiller, through the distillery and my various like, modular adventures that I had, you know, some sort of, res respect among people in the analog community, they'd be like, oh, we should bring these two things together. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. So that's probably the energy that you're hearing on that, podcast. And 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Apparently, because I, I'll tell you in some cases when listening to that mm-hmm. <affirmative>, I was like, dude, you don't have to pretend to not know him. I know that he's your, like, like grade school buddy. No, just go ahead. No, I mean, that's how it <span style="color:red" data-ts="2270.64" data-end_ts="2270.8" title="2270.64" id=c_"2270.64">__felt__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>I'm hearing, yeah. I'm hearing all of that stuff for the first time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b><laugh> Okay. <laugh>. Yeah. Well, it's, it's interesting because, I, I think what you certainly did find is you find that found a good partner for you because the comfort that just exudes from that conversation is really, is like visceral. It was really interesting. Let's talk a little bit about the development of the, you said it's the, was it <span style="color:red" data-ts="2295.74" data-end_ts="2295.96" title="2295.74" id=c_"2295.74">__the__</span> empire? Em, 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Emperor. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Emperor? Okay. Yeah. The Emperor model. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>I would, I would guess I would consider like a product line <span style="color:red" data-ts="2302.85" data-end_ts="2303.2" title="2302.85" id=c_"2302.85">__since__</span> around Emperor, I would call that empire. <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>The Empire. Right. Something like that <span style="color:red" data-ts="2307.43" data-end_ts="2307.72" title="2307.43" id=c_"2307.43">__line__</span>. Yeah. So you've, what you've basically done is you've, you've put a compute module together at sort of like the highest level that could not have been easy. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Yeah. So I wanna emphasize that the hardware revision that was seen at the NAMM Show was put together in about three weeks. That's not a lot of development at all. We were working really hard. I don't know that we could have worked any harder on it. But leading up to that, we had had some interesting ideas. We found a board that would probably be able to do all the sampling things we wanted to do mm-hmm. <affirmative>, but sort of our energy led us to revise. I, my ideas for the sampling, were not really lining up with everything that Rich wanted to do for the sampling. And I, Rich's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2358.6" data-end_ts="2358.8" title="2358.6" id=c_"2358.6">__ideas__</span> are probably a lot better, to be honest. What, what I really wanted was, because I, I use Eurorack, I had really gotten this idea into my head that we need a sort of automated deep sampling module. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Yes. Which would allow you to, for example, patch up a synth voice or something that's a loop or whatever, and then sample it across the entire keyboard range, and then go through another dimension of, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2383.06" data-end_ts="2383.28" title="2383.06" id=c_"2383.06">__and__</span>, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2383.48" data-end_ts="2383.68" title="2383.48" id=c_"2383.48">__maybe__</span> that would be like a CC or Velocity or something. But in, in modular you could just say control voltage, and then just fill that in through however much resolution you want and so forth and so forth. Or even you could just sort of let it have an algorithm and just leave it patched up for however long you wanted. And it would just keep building a sample library of like round robin layers and different resolution and fill in the holes until, you know, it was more and more complete just as long as you left it up. It's like a set it and forget it kind of thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Sure. Which, which for me <span style="color:red" data-ts="2413.43" data-end_ts="2413.72" title="2413.43" id=c_"2413.43">__that__</span>, and we, I guess we have that now in, you can run whatever software you want on Emperor, so you can go ahead and run Green Noise either on Linux or on Windows, by the way. And, and, and do and just do that, which totally knew what I meant. 'cause he, you know, he's a huge, e p s 16 plus <span style="color:red" data-ts="2430.42" data-end_ts="2430.64" title="2430.42" id=c_"2430.42">__and__</span> a SR 10 head, which, which does exactly that. So you can plug in, say like a minimoog or something, you know, that has midi Yeah. And it'll just sample it deeply, whatever <span style="color:red" data-ts="2441.08" data-end_ts="2441.36" title="2441.08" id=c_"2441.08">__patch__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Oh, I see. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2442.34" data-end_ts="2442.56" title="2442.34" id=c_"2442.34">__So__</span> it's sort of like what that old matic or red Matta key thing Did 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>I, I actually don't know to what you're referring. Oh, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2450.8" data-end_ts="2451" title="2450.8" id=c_"2450.8">__really__</span>? But maybe, anyway, for me, this would completely change patching and also the kind of size of system I needed. Right. Because you would be able to do things where, by the way, I, I'm not trying to suggest that this kind of sampling would replace tracking out whatever you wrote on your sequencers or <span style="color:red" data-ts="2467.84" data-end_ts="2467.88" title="2467.84" id=c_"2467.84">__whatever__</span>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2467.88" data-end_ts="2468" title="2467.88" id=c_"2467.88">__Of__</span> course, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Of course not. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>But <span style="color:red" data-ts="2468.92" data-end_ts="2469" title="2468.92" id=c_"2468.92">__it__</span>, but, but like, you track out whatever you want and then you leave the patch up and then you, you can come back at it with a, for a remix or I don't know, you know, whatever. You know, you would have like a personal library of all your patches at in audio form. Of course. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Well, I, I think that what that is is that's, it's kind of an interesting, interesting use of sampling that I think isn't done often enough. And that's, the ability to sort of like, deal with massive complexity using sampling as a tool. And where, where I used to see this a lot was people doing really significant, whether it's turntableist moves or mm-hmm. <affirmative> significant other stuff and doing real <span style="color:red" data-ts="2511.96" data-end_ts="2512.16" title="2511.96" id=c_"2511.96">__time__</span> sampling into an M P C. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Right. Because then, you could take that now what was this complex physical movement that was based on a certain record on a table at a certain speed mm-hmm. <affirmative> Sure. You capture that, that frees you up to do another thing. While that sound is still available, you actually, you increase the access to complexity without necessarily having to have a more complex system. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Oh, yeah. Okay. Sure. So, in, in terms of like a Eurorack modular, which, a lot of your listeners probably are into, you know, you could have X number of modules, so you could leave up that patch and then sample it, and then take it down, but leave it going, you know what I mean? And then use all those modules for other things. Right. I, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2556.72" data-end_ts="2556.84" title="2556.72" id=c_"2556.72">__I__</span> also, there's, there's two things I just wanna add in Right. There is, that's not the only sampling stuff I'm into. People who know me probably know I'm really, really, really into machine. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, and I got into machine right at the beginning of that product because I, I knew of MPCs, but the, the idea that you were just gonna use the computer, you know, it seems, it's sort of like an early full circle kind of thing for us, because we showed, we plugged in DJ Bert's, like artist series machine, which, now belongs to Rich, you know, on the show floor. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>And we were like putting, using machine within our <span style="color:red" data-ts="2590.36" data-end_ts="2590.52" title="2590.36" id=c_"2590.36">__product__</span>, product. So, you know, it's not like my sampling was so limited to this one idea. Right. And the other thing is, I was explaining this to some people on the show floor, and a lot of people got the sense that it had to be a one-to-one patch for that to work. Mm-hmm. You know, like, just like a one shot. I'm like, it would also work with a loop. And to be honest, even if it was just kind of a random thing, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2609.31" data-end_ts="2609.6" title="2609.31" id=c_"2609.31">__like__</span> you could totally still do this, you know what I mean? You would just record lots and lots and lots and lots of round robin samples or, or, or, you know, like have different CV points that change it a little bit. It doesn't have to be one-to-one for this to work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Sure, of course. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>But a anyway, to get back on topic, I, I told Rich I wanted to do this. He said, oh, renos does that, and, guess what? It'll run on our board. I'm <span style="color:red" data-ts="2632.16" data-end_ts="2632.2" title="2632.16" id=c_"2632.16">__like__</span>, oh, that's, that's fantastic. He did some early tests with that, but we sort of decided to do a hardware revision. He said, you know, you know, I'm running kind of like a hacked version of Renos or whatever, and if, if we ran this other board, we wouldn't even have to ask them to port anything over. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, you know, it would, we would just be able to install it and go. Sure. And they, we even talked about, you know, renos is not like all that expensive, so, you know, you could ship it without it and people could just buy it or we could just eat the cost or maybe get a deal with Bundle it in. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Bundle it. Yeah. We were like, oh yeah, let's do like a tracker module. That sounds dope. Right. So we were doing that, and I don't know, rich just eventually found, I can't give away what it is probably still, we, we came up with something that you could absolutely fit into a Euro module, and that had essentially no heat issues at all. So that's one of the big questions people always ask us. They're like, how big does your case have to be? What special heat considerations? The answer is none. Like, you can really throw this into whatever case you're using, like a skiff or, you know, your mono rocket, whatever, your defer, whatever, you know, anything. And, and it should be just fine. We, we run it all day on the show floor with, you know, all kinds of different things and you, it's not even like hot to the touch or anything. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, you know, Intel's really killing it. So they totally understand that the paradigm of computing is changing. So, it didn't turn out that everybody just wants smartphones all the time, although that is a thing. But, something like, say like the Surface Pro three, that sort of like form factor or there, there's another one called I think, the yoga maybe. Right. But, but you know, that it, it, it's like, it is all things to all people all the time, you know? Right. It's kind of a tablet, it's kind of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2732.6" data-end_ts="2732.72" title="2732.6" id=c_"2732.6">__a__</span>, the laptop, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2733.84" data-end_ts="2734.12" title="2733.84" id=c_"2733.84">__they__</span>, they totally understand those needs that different, you know, hardware manufacturers have with the same sort of development kit that a lot of people would make into a tablet. Right. We made into a really powerful eurorack module. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Yeah. That's, that's really exciting. Now, you said that you have both CV ins as well as audio ins and outs. Yeah. My assumption this is, there's, there's some sort of magical hackery going on in the background, because if you look at the machinations that many people that are trying to interface a, an external computer with a, with a Euro <span style="color:red" data-ts="2772.02" data-end_ts="2772.24" title="2772.02" id=c_"2772.02">__Act__</span> modular doing, you know, you're having to deal with DC coupled outputs, and then what the hell do you do with the inputs? And it gets a little bit messy. How difficult was it for you to design something that could be a great interface that wasn't hella, hella bad development? 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>In terms of our CV stuff, I, I kind of had hella bad development, as you said, <laugh>. Okay. But, that prototype does not necessarily indicate the exact nature of the io. Without giving like too much away, of what as of today, of this recording of this podcast, I think the commercial release of this product will be like mm-hmm. <affirmative>, for example, we may very well be able to, for example, I'm not necessarily confirming this, we might be able to just say that you have 16 ins and 16 outs and you can use them for like, whatever. I'm not, you know, comfortable necessarily confirming this stuff. I, I kind of, I, I don't know. I kind of wanna dodge this question a little bit. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Okay. That's cool. I mean, I, I guess because there are a lot of people that listen to this podcast that are just kind of into hearing about the beads of sweat that appear on your forehead when you're trying to design something, right? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And, you know, just thinking about what you must have gone through in order to develop that prototype. I'm thinking that, you know, at least if I, if I project myself in that position, it seems like a bit of an overwhelming task. And maybe that's exactly what you're alluding to, is that it wasn't overwhelming task, and it doesn't mean it's even close to complete at this point. Oh. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>It is very close to complete at this point in laying it out. I really did not want to label this as, oh, this is your gate out and this is your, you know, pitch in. I, I didn't wanna do any of that because that, that's not really what I'm all about. If, if you've looked at some of my influences in terms of interface Yeah. Like, people, like the Mono or Keith McMillan, there's, there's not a lot of like legibility on that stuff. Right. Right. And in fact, on, mono stuff, there is no legibility at all, typically. Right. So, on, on, on anybody's grading, it doesn't even say mono anywhere or like a serial number or anything. Right. Right. So, and I, I'm kind of into that. We, we might just label them like, these are all your inputs and these are all your outputs, but we're, we're gonna make them all configurable in software on, on the touch interface. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>So to really allow you to do whatever you want. I also definitely want to emphasize O S C over midi. Okay. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2923.69" data-end_ts="2924.04" title="2923.69" id=c_"2923.69">__There__</span>, there's, there's no reason within our products that you have to use MIDI as, I mean, we'll, we'll, we'll let, we'll let you, you know, in your D <span style="color:red" data-ts="2930.08" data-end_ts="2930.2" title="2930.08" id=c_"2930.08">__A__</span> W or whatever. W why, why down that, why live yourself that way? That Yeah. Yeah. W I'm just not as big of a fan as some other people are. And that, that has to do with my being 21 probably, that I, I, I just don't have as much midi stuff as some other people do. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And it's, it's just like <span style="color:red" data-ts="2948.66" data-end_ts="2948.88" title="2948.66" id=c_"2948.66">__if__</span>, if we're going to open Eurorack format where, for example, in the mono modules, you're gonna patch with U S B cables, you know, and if you're gonna have full on computers in there, why limit yourself to MIDI for any reason? 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Right? Sure. So in fact, I've seen people online on forums or Facebook or whatever, shout about, like, I, I wish at least <span style="color:red" data-ts="2966.89" data-end_ts="2967.24" title="2966.89" id=c_"2966.89">__Manum__</span> would label the different sections of pads, different things, and like, I can't even take that seriously. Like, it's, it's just misses the boat entirely. So <span style="color:red" data-ts="2974.94" data-end_ts="2975.16" title="2974.94" id=c_"2974.94">__we__</span> we're gonna try to make our design language very clear. We, we <span style="color:red" data-ts="2979.2" data-end_ts="2979.32" title="2979.2" id=c_"2979.2">__did__</span>. We're just trying to figure out right now on the business side of things, not necessarily really on the technical side, because that's for all practical purposes, very close to being finished. Okay. We're trying to figure out how to release the highest quality product as soon as possible, you know, such that we can make enough to meet demand and things like that. A lot of other people that you've spoken to on this podcast and you yourself, will attest that that's a completely different game or, or task than just making it work, right? Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Absolutely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>For, for, for example, for the show we had a three D printed panel, shout out to Mitch Gitz for three d printing our panel for us. And that panel was printed the Friday before the NAMM Show. <laugh> and I wired everything the panel and soldered it together at the thud office, you know, practically, you know, 10 feet away from Bert's turntables or whatever the night before we had to leave. So, you know, what I really liked about our booth at the NAMM Show was, first of all, the fact that there's a Muff <span style="color:red" data-ts="3038.96" data-end_ts="3039.32" title="3038.96" id=c_"3038.96">__Wiggler__</span> booth to support all of these small manufacturers and people who are just starting out like Rich in me and, and whatever is super exciting. And to sort of unite everybody either under this big Shriners Laden analog haven W m D booth or the Muffler booth is really exciting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>I, I really just liked the number of people who saw, oh my God, that module is running Razor or Max m sb or a reactor or a machine and just got it right. You know? Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3068.91" data-end_ts="3069.2" title="3068.91" id=c_"3068.91">__That__</span>, that was really what we wanted. And it, the na show and the people who came by the booth really delivered on all that stuff. And, and I, I have to give like shout outs to, people like Bit Wig who on the plane finished a build that had a, like, multi-touch interface that we were able to show <laugh>. So that that's really amazing. That's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Awesome. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Yeah. And to, people like Output in, in, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3093.44" data-end_ts="3093.64" title="3093.44" id=c_"3093.44">__out__</span> in Hollywood, you know, I, I had been working with them for a while and we said, Hey, please come downstairs, we'll show you our module running Rev. And they went, what? You know? And that, that's been just really a positive thing that a lot of people really get the potential of what it is. And to be honest, you know, I'll say what I said to almost everybody on the, on the show <span style="color:red" data-ts="3113.96" data-end_ts="3114.16" title="3113.96" id=c_"3113.96">__for__</span> that, a lot of us probably including you, Darwin you know, perform out with like a Euro system mm-hmm. <affirmative> and use the computer for one specific thing. Like, oh, I run this one Max Patch, or I just multi-track my performance, or, or I have a backing track or whatever. And this like is way more than capable of filling that whatever that one purpose is. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Well, I think too that, that people underestimate the value of having the tools in the case with the rest of the U racks. So a really good example in my case is I have one of the O'Toole Oscilloscopes, okay. I also have an oscilloscope. I have a really nice oscilloscope. I just, there, there's something about having the OTO in my, I have one of little tip top fold up cases, right? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. So, so space is at a premium, but there's something about having the oscilloscope built in there, part of every patch. It, it becomes a real part of my performance system in a way that an external device, just can't I actually use it to like, pay attention? Oh, am I distorting, am I approaching levels that are gonna be distorting? Is that an interesting looking animation of the waveform? Things like that. I, it, it sort of like helps me reinforce what I'm hearing by giving me something to watch as well, which in performance <span style="color:red" data-ts="3193.16" data-end_ts="3193.4" title="3193.16" id=c_"3193.16">__land__</span> is really important. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Similarly, I think that what you're doing here is provides a similar option, but kind of on a grander scale. So, as you suggest I perform using, oftentimes using a Big Max patch in that case, you know, the question is, well, . How bad, you know, first of all, is it going to irritate the, audience that I'm using a laptop? Are they gonna assume that I'm just dialing in the performance, you know, to what level can I use it and or can I use it like lid closed version? So like that, it just gets messy, right? And the fact of the matter is, I'm not doing laptop performance, I'm really doing modular performance, but the laptop open implies something to people in the same way that like walking on stage with a guitar sort of <span style="color:red" data-ts="3248.13" data-end_ts="3248.48" title="3248.13" id=c_"3248.13">__apply__</span> implies something, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Mm-hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b><affirmative>. And, I don't necessarily always like that implication. So the other nice thing is having something like, like your emperor it put in in rack allows me to avoid the implications of that, which seems pretty smart and pretty, pretty useful to me as a performer. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Yeah. I I figured that you, you might bring this up. I think that the ability to consolidate your performance set up, is important. I, I know that I have performed with some ridiculously huge setups in the past, and I <laugh> I thoroughly enjoyed it and kind of, don't necessarily fetishize bringing such a small thing to perform on. But I, I will say that like, like a lot of people I've had to, for some reason, I think United changed the rules for what you could carry on, like how big it was. Right. You know, I, I bought like a really small flight case. I think it was just like a six U by 104 HP shout out to Elite Cases. I really enjoyed it. You know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3311.12" data-end_ts="3311.24" title="3311.12" id=c_"3311.12">__I__</span>, you know, I, I, I put, and I didn't necessarily fall into the trap of putting small modules in there, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>I put one of the biggest Euro modules, I, like, I have a Q qmf four from Shaman that I, I threw in there mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And I really enjoyed that experience. But with Emperor, one of the things that we can deliver on is that you can put your whole performance thing then at least the same box. Yeah. So maybe you're like me and you show up to a gig with a mono rocket Lexington <span style="color:red" data-ts="3339" data-end_ts="3339.2" title="3339" id=c_"3339">__two__</span>. Right? Which, for those who don't know is 150 HP by 12 U, there's a really big box. Right. But, you know, you can fit a lot of Euro modules into that box. I, I definitely think that people are going to enjoy it for performance situations. And I was talking to some people about this sampling thing. I have sort of mixed feelings about the whole sample library sales deal. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>I, I've done some of that stuff in the past and will probably continue to do it. And I think it is, is nice <span style="color:red" data-ts="3368.24" data-end_ts="3368.56" title="3368.24" id=c_"3368.24">__during__</span>, I mean, like, I, I certainly appreciate all the sample packs that been sent over the years or that I've bought, but I think it would be really cool to bring it into the future in, in the sense that there are these people who patch up a patch when they arrive. Right? Right. Like, say like a Richard Divine character mm-hmm. <affirmative> or something like that. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, what if after they're set, they left it patched up and they let Emperor sample it for a while, and then you could do something where you would like sold the product every month, which was like your patches from those different performances. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Well, if you start thinking about in that way, all of a sudden, you know, one of the big things to do at gigs now to make some money is to be able to burn up or, or provide, digital copies of whatever performance a person just saw. Sure. What if, what if, for those of us that are electronic music, the opportunity came <span style="color:red" data-ts="3415.68" data-end_ts="3415.96" title="3415.68" id=c_"3415.68">__with__</span> saying, well, you know, here's <span style="color:red" data-ts="3417.52" data-end_ts="3417.64" title="3417.52" id=c_"3417.52">__a__</span> thumb drive with, sample series based off of the patch that was used. I mean, if nothing else, even if it was just for a matter of revisiting the sonic experience, it seems like it'd be really an interesting tweak on, on a merch kind of concept for a live performance. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>That, that's, that's interesting. We talked about before the NAMM show, bringing like a CD drive and just burning CDs, right. So that when, when we were talking to say like, you, we could be like, oh, hey, do you like this? Do you want it? And we'll just, you know, make you one <laugh>. And we did do some of that. I, I made a beat on the show floor that Rich actually liked Uhhuh <affirmative>, which I was, which 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>I was, I 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Was pretty proud of myself. So we're like, Hey, before we shut this thing down, let's like make sure we record that and, you know, pull it off the prototype and everything. And Right. A couple times people sent like, wow, can you send it to me? And we're like, yeah. Just, you know, do you have a thumb drive on you? And you know, we did, we did that whole thing. I definitely think that that's an exciting culture. Another thing lined up for us, we, we went to a not very good show, which was hosted by a group that trades Serato Vinyl. And we were, we're really into the idea of taking that into the future where you're trading records or, or, or, or something that's like a physical thing that you have to meet up with somebody to trade. Right. That, that does more than say like a Serato record. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>So without giving away too much of our end game, I definitely think that's gonna make sym tome it's a lot more fun. And that you have a reason to go beyond seeing the performances, beyond seeing the new toys, beyond, you know, hanging out with your friends. There's actually like, another piece of business or something that you want to get done there. I, I'm, I'm excited about this different performance, paradigm <span style="color:red" data-ts="3519.82" data-end_ts="3520.04" title="3519.82" id=c_"3519.82">__to__</span> sort of talk about what I'm thinking. Maybe this is getting a little off the rails for your podcast, but I'm, I'm a big fan of Drip fm. People won't know you can go, like, subscribe to a record label and then all of your, all of their releases just sort of show up in your Dropbox, right? Like, it's, it's, it's really nice, especially if you're like a DJ or something and say like, you're a drum <span style="color:red" data-ts="3539.08" data-end_ts="3539.32" title="3539.08" id=c_"3539.08">__based__</span> dj. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>They've able to subscribe to like hospital records and just have all that new stuff whenever it comes out for like $10 a month is really cool. And so some artists have started their own grips, which I'm a little less on board with. But if, if you were able to do something where, you know, let's say that you play like four gigs a week or something. You're a real touring artist and you play live synth stuff, the ability to share the deep samples of all those patches in a subscription service is something that I'm actually thinking about offering. I I think that could be really exciting if you're a diehard, like Twin Braids fan or something. Right. Wouldn't it be cool to get to hear whatever patch they were using that night, or, or, or whatever. I, I think that there's a real opportunity for growth there. And, I I think that people are ready for different ways to consume music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>I, I think you're absolutely right. And I, and I think that, I think that there are a lot of implications, not only from how we're interacting with music and music delivery, currently through networks and stuff like that, but I think that even when you're, when you take a look at what, you know, you go to NAMM and you see that, well, last year there was one, you know, two years ago there was like zero booths about <laugh> Modular since, I mean, I know that's not true. Big City's been out there for a while. Has, and you know, now this 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Year, ca and WMD started. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Yeah. Well, but now this year it's, there's like eight different places you go <span style="color:red" data-ts="3624.72" data-end_ts="3624.88" title="3624.72" id=c_"3624.72">__for__</span> modular stuff. So that implies, 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>And, and like, I I, I really wanna emphasize this, like, this was a huge year for synthesizers. Yeah. Like, Nam was crazy this year <span style="color:red" data-ts="3634.14" data-end_ts="3634.36" title="3634.14" id=c_"3634.14">__for__</span>, I mean, for one thing, we're not all relegated to Holly. I mean, I, I was, but there, there were, you know, there was this WM d booth upstairs in <span style="color:red" data-ts="3643.48" data-end_ts="3643.72" title="3643.48" id=c_"3643.48">__Hall__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3643.85" data-end_ts="3644.2" title="3643.85" id=c_"3643.85">__Holly__</span>, you know, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="3644.68" data-end_ts="3644.92" title="3644.68" id=c_"3644.68">__that__</span>, that's unbelievable. That's, if that's not an arrival, I mean, you know, but that's really huge. And, I, I'm glad that NAMM <span style="color:red" data-ts="3651.56" data-end_ts="3651.76" title="3651.56" id=c_"3651.56">__is__</span> turned into this like, synthesizer destination, you know? Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>But, you know, I, I think the implications of the, the growth of modulars, the growth of synthesis in general, the, the growth of controllers and a lot of different, controller, types, the continued growth of, of DJ and turntable Yeah. Technologies, all of these things are just implying, this thing about not wanting to be passive consumers. And if there's anything that warms my heart, it's the, it's the idea that, you know, maybe there's gonna come a time where, where people can't really imagine just pressing a synth preset and playing a tune, right? Yeah. Maybe there's, you know, where the idea of like wiring up a specific oscillator to a specific filter is just considered how I work with a synthesizer. I think that's, I think that's a really exciting potential future. But in, in any case, I think there's implications with all this stuff that, that there's a really exciting future. And it seems like, you, what, what is the name of your company? I forgot <span style="color:red" data-ts="3722.08" data-end_ts="3722.24" title="3722.08" id=c_"3722.08">__it__</span> was wrong 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Tip of my head. We we're calling ourselves Tipsy Circuits. We might be called something else soon. Okay. <laugh>. But, at the, at the time of this podcast, we're still going strong, calling ourselves Tips, tipsy circuits. All <span style="color:red" data-ts="3732.68" data-end_ts="3732.72" title="3732.68" id=c_"3732.68">__right__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Well that's a, that's a good one, <laugh>. I like it.

<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Thanks, Darvin. This is really nice. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Well, and with that, I'm going to, allow you to get on with your day. Thanks for your time. I really appreciate it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Absolutely. It was, it was an honor. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Alright, catch you later. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And there it is, number 67 in a bag. Thank you so much for listening. Thanks for sharing it with your friends. The numbers are really pumping up nicely. Please do me a favor. If you get a chance, if you get this stream through iTunes, please pop over there and give it a nice review. I could really just use the attention over on that side of things. Awful lot of people get the podcast through direct downloads, but nevertheless, having some good reviews over at iTunes will be great. Otherwise, share it with your friends. It's always great when people post stuff up on Facebook that always seems to have a great result. And, if you have ideas for people that I should interview or if you think you yourself, should be interviewed, let me know. I'm always game for everything, so thanks a lot and we'll talk to.
