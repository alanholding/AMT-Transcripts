      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Okay. Today, I have the great opportunity to meet someone who I, I have been wanting to, I've been actually working myself off to ask, ask him to be on the, on the podcast. I've been following him for a while on Facebook. I
        finally was like, I've got to do it. And so I reached out and he was very happy. It seemed like <span style="color:red" data-ts="20.73" data-end_ts="21.18" title="20.73" id=c_"20.73">__too__</span> to have a chat. So, the person I'm talking
        about is Carl Stone And with that, I'm going to stop talking and start conversing. Hey Carl, how are you? Hey, </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Carl Stone: </b>Nice to talk to you. Yeah, I mean, I,
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>I want to thank you so much for taking the time I have followed your work. It seems like for a long, long time, it's always been so influential to me. I want to thank you for doing that stuff and for being willing to talk
        about it, for people who might not be super, I, I think most of the people listen to my podcasts will know who you are and know some of your work, but, why don't you talk a little bit about what some of your most recent work has been? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Carl: </b>I mean, my most recent work sort of fits in to my overall kind of compositional strategy and approach going back to when I started, which was, gosh, when I think about it, you know, almost 50 years ago using found, so my, you know,
      appropriated music or some might even say stolen music as a starting point for creating my own unique works. So back in the beginning, I was working with tape recorders, taking LP records and, and using tape recorder techniques to radically
      modify them. And today I do that in the digital domain using the technical sampling and programs like max, but, typically the starting point is familiar or perhaps unfamiliar a piece of music, which serves as a jumping off point for my own
      particular creativity
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Right now. I, for me, you were one of the people that, in a very, maybe modern way, you really represented the beginning of sampling from one aspect. So there was like sampling on, on one hand was kind of coming in from the
        hip hop genres and stuff like that, or pop music. They used it for very emulative tasks, but you were very early on the scene doing things that were in a very creative and in kind of more abstract way. Now I will, I would say that, that for
        me, this has been really reiterated by, by two compilations that were recently put out. And by recently, I mean, in the last few years, one called electronic music from the seventies and eighties and one electronic music from the eighties and
        nineties, which to me, it was great because they sort of like put in one place, that, that material for me to go over again. And it was really, it was really amazing because in a lot of ways, some of that early stuff, even the stuff from the
        seventies, I can imagine that being produced yesterday, when I listened to your current stuff, that, that thread line of how you manipulate stuff has kind of stayed the same. It it's, it's really clear that rather than just a technical
        exercise, this was a voice that you had in your head. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Carl: </b>Yeah, I think that's very true. It really is been something that's sort of consistently stayed with me for better or worse. For a lot of these many years, it is kind of my singular approach and the, of course the technology has
      changed and, that's sort of enabled new ways of doing what I do, but, whether I do what I do this way, or I do what I did that way, it's still what I do. And, and that's been pretty consistent through line for, for a long time.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Right? Sure. Now you are currently located in Tokyo, correct? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Carl: </b>That is correct. I've been in Tokyo for 20 years.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>That's what I thought. And, I, what ha what caused you to go there and stay there? What drew you there and what, what makes you want to stay? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Carl: </b>I started going to Japan in the eighties. I had a, a residency grant in 1988 for six months from a support institution called the Asian cultural council to live in Tokyo. And my stated purpose was to, I had actually had sort of
      three fold purpose. One was to meet with composers and people on the musical scene in Tokyo and find out what was going on there. Number one, number two, sort of introduce myself and my particular music to the Tokyo scene or the Japanese
      musical community. And number three, maybe the most important for me was to document the urban soundscape of Tokyo at that time had a digital or a portable digital recorder and a stereo microphone. And I wandered around the city fascinated by
      the soundscape while being in Tokyo. I, you know, I did meet a lot of people and it was sort of at a high point in the tote in the Japanese economy, the so-called bubble. So, there was a lot going on. It was very, very active. The town was hot.
      And I had, after I finished my residency, found a certain degree of success and appreciation from the Japanese audience, sort of like a Tom waits, big in Japan kind
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Of thing, and
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Carl: </b>Being unknown in the U S but somehow popular in Japan. I have many invitations to return to work on projects. So I was going back every year and, you know, they had developed friends and started learn the language a little bit and
      so on and so forth. And then this continued even after the bubble so-called bubble burst, things were not as deluxe economically, but I still find myself, you know, visiting Japan at least once a year, until I did another residency back in the
      year 2001 at a media arts center in the middle of the country, a place called yamas. And while I was there, I was headhunted by a university who was looking for someone to fill in for a teacher who had just left to go to Paris, a towel Tanaka.
      So a towel to NACA was at a university. He left to go to Paris and they found me and, made me an offer.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Carl: </b>And I decided to stay, I mean, it was 2001 Bush was the president. You know, the attacks had just happened. Things were getting very weird politically. And I thought, well, maybe it's, I, I had never imagined living as an ex-pat
      anywhere. And I had never met, had definitely never imagined being a professor at a university. I was kind of proud to not be affiliated with the university. I thought that, you know, that, you know, being a professor sort of takes off your
      age, you don't really have to fight things or to secure. And, but I did it. And so, that happened in 2001. I've been here ever since I've been, you know, a full professor at a university and still they gave me enough latitude. I mean, part of
      the deal that I negotiated when I was still being able to travel and tour and performed, I could still go back to the states to see my parents who were alive at the time.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Carl: </b>And, I didn't have to fight for tenure. I came in with full tenure from day one. And so I thought, well, you know, I guess they really want me and nobody else stayed. And so, and I like it here. I mean, the most important thing is
      that, I really liked the life in Japan and have been able to make a goal of it. So the soundscape is remains fascinating. It's changed, but it's still interesting. The lifestyle fits to my personality. The music scene is interesting. The food's
      great. Yeah. And, so here I am before COVID happened, I was, you know, coming back to the states a couple of times a year, I kept a place in, you know, an apartment in California where I'm from originally and, you know, was visiting fairly
      regularly. So, I mean, I w I was ex-pat, but I didn't feel like I severed my ties. And now with COVID, I haven't been able to go back for a while. So it's a little more of a patriotic feeling, but nonetheless, you know, I, I still, I still, you
      know, I have a lot of friends in the U S and it was still a keep in touch with them. I'd like to go back, see how my apartment's doing
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Well. And I mean, you are, you're kind of like well-known for being, not only, not only a laptop performer, but one of the first actually, but, someone who would do you, you know, you do live performances with, with your laptop system. Has,
        has, have you been able to do any performances at all since the beginning of the pandemic? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Carl: </b>Well, I've done some, but not a lot. I mean, much, much less. I haven't been able to tour with any regularity. I mean, at the time, depending on the kid, I had a full tour book, you know, in the U S and in Europe, everything got
      canceled, by the fall of 2020, you know, I had a few remaining festival gigs, which were able to convert to online performances. And, since then, you know, I've done a couple of things here in Japan. I haven't been able to go outside. Yeah.
      What is,
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>What is the situation there? Are, are the borders fairly well locked down? I mean, we just, the Olympics just happened and I guess I should, I should even remember from that, that was pretty clear about them not wanting people
        traipse in, in and out of the country too much. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Carl: </b>Yeah. Basically the borders are closed for people without sufficient rationale. I mean, right. Family emergencies or work obligations, or if you're a permanent resident, you know, with the so-called, you know, what an America would
      be called a green card, right. A work permit and a work permit, which is I I'm a permanent resident here. So I, I, I could go out if I wanted and I could come back and would have to quarantine, I suppose, but people from, I just was on the news
      yesterday, said that compared with, two years ago, 2019, the number of foreign tourists is down 95%, 95%. Wow. So that gives you an idea. You know, it's basically pretty closed. I mean, I feel very sorry for the tourist <span style="color:red"
        data-ts="684.82" data-end_ts="685.16" title="684.82" id=c_"684.82">__space__</span> businesses. A lot of them have, folded, right. It's definitely an economic crisis, but as just someone it's been, it's been very nice actually, but to be able
      to wander around without a bunch of tourists, everywhere you go, sorry to say,
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>I, I was lucky enough to be able to be a tourist in Japan sometimes. And it was, it was an amazing place to visit, but it was, there were an awful lot of people plowing their way through it. So one of the things I like doing
        on my podcast is talking to people about their background and, and how they got to be the artists that they are. And in your case, I'm particularly curious because you sort of, you, you came from kind of a, from what I can tell kind of a
        classical background, but you really kind of adapted to working with technology as kind of a core of your song. And so I'm kind of curious, like growing up, how, how did you get engaged in music? How did you get engaged in technology and what
        was the impetus to combine the two? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Carl: </b>I was kind of a music enthusiast from a very early age, as a small child, seemed to love music. My parents reported one of the first gifts I got as a little child, was a record player, like a 45 RPM record player and a set of
      disks. And, I sort of stepped through, I loved classical music as a little boy, eventually. I, grew to appreciate opera Italian opera, like Puccini, and then later Wagner. And so, yes, my, my earliest instincts were, I loved also folk music,
      but, classical music was kind of my main hit. And, then in the mid sixties, like the Beatles came out, I was kind of interested in them, although, I, I was sort of actually, I was kind of a classical music snob actually at the age of 11. Okay.
      And, so, you know, I liked the Beatles, secretly, but I didn't tell any of my friends at school and, you know, listened to like a am radio late at night in Los Angeles, KFW B a w.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Carl: </b>And so I developed an appreciation for Motown and things like that. Technology, I don't know. I mean, I, my parents gave me a tape recorder and I fooled around with it, you know, recording my voice and shifting the speed up and
      down. And it actually had a sort of an over, they called it sound on sound, right. Or you could overdub. Yeah. And I experimented with that a little bit, but what happened was in 19, I guess it was 68 or 69, Paul beaver in Bernie Krauss, Bernie
      Krauss. I think people note today because of his fantastic, collection of environmental recordings at the time he was partnered with a guy named Paul beaver who is maybe a little less known and they put out an anthology, a box set of, I think,
      two LPs of nothing but <span style="color:red" data-ts="889.56" data-end_ts="890.19" title="889.56" id=c_"889.56">__MOBE__</span> synthesizer,
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Not so not songs, just the sound just, </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Carl: </b>I, you know, it's been so long since I've revisited that said that I, I don't remember if they did any songs, like maybe as one side, but certainly the majority of it was just, this is a sine wave. This is a square wave, that kind
      of thing. Right. I was just kind of fascinated by the sounds and I, and then I actually, you know, dug some of them onto the tape recorders and tried mixing them together. And, you know, I wasn't like composing per se. I was kind of
      experimenting with what these sounds would be like if you combine them. And just at that time, I heard that a place in the Los Angeles area where, which is where I grew up a place was opening up. It was called the California Institute of the
      arts Morton Subotnick was going to be in the music faculty.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Carl: </b>And they were going to have not one, not two but three synthesizer studios. And I thought, well, this sounds pretty interesting. Maybe I should apply to go. And I did apply and I didn't get in, but because I didn't really have any
      formal training. And they were looking for someone who knew something about the history of electronic music, other than a beaver and Krauss record. So I got rejected, but I went anyway on the advice of a friend, a family friend, and went and
      went to all the classes, signed up for studio time, use the studios and started to kind of find my groove about it a little less than a year later, because the studios were under such heavy use. They were also very heavily damaged just from
      overuse, I guess. And, the decision was instead of letting 60 people sign up for studio time, they were going to limit it to 12 and more Subotnick was going to make the decision who's at 12, we're going to meet.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Carl: </b>And I guess he had noticed that I was working diligently and I was doing something. And, so he put my name on that list of 12 having forgotten that he was the one who rejected me in the first place. So he w you know, they, he
      submitted my name to the registrar's office and they got the message back. This guy isn't even a student. So he, you know, he took a second look at my, my situation, made me a student that gave me a scholarship. And then that really is kind of
      the open the door to my work with technology.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Got it. All right. That makes sense. So, I mean, there wasn't really any bridge between the beaver and cross album and Morton spot, Nick. I mean, that, that, cause that seems like a really big chasm, </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Right? Or was it just the synthesizer, just getting in front of a synthesizer?
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Carl: </b>Well, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1066" data-end_ts="1066.12" title="1066" id=c_"1066">__see__</span> the synthesizer. I wasn't like, oh, I got go to a school where more than surviving as a teacher. I didn't know that much
      about Morton Subotnick. Maybe I had bought silver apples of the moon at that point. I don't remember exactly when I got it, but I did get it. And it was very interesting to me that was his first kind of a debut album. Right. It was, I think the
      first album that was commissioned, especially for it was the first electronic music commissioned for the medium of the LP record. Right. And so what came first? I can't recall, but you know, somehow that gap was bridged. I mean, when Subotnick
      said, you know, I'm sorry, you can't be a student here, go home and learn about electronic music, learn about new music, which I really didn't know anything about. He said, read the RIAA, which was, I don't know if you know, Darius, but, this
      was a very, very academic European take on new music. I mean, stuck housing Xenakis, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1135.62" data-end_ts="1136.43" title="1135.62" id=c_"1135.62">__legality__</span>, people like that. Right. So I did take it
      seriously as <span style="color:red" data-ts="1140.75" data-end_ts="1141.04" title="1140.75" id=c_"1140.75">__advice__</span> seriously. And I did study up. So this was all part of kind of bridging the gap that I was, you know, I was doing the
      bridging <span style="color:red" data-ts="1148.85" data-end_ts="1149.03" title="1148.85" id=c_"1148.85">__work__</span> while I was attending these classes, auditing the classes really as a, as a non-student back in the earliest days of the, of
      the school.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Right. Interesting, interesting. Now, you know, again, I recently got the vinyl, copies of the, of your early music collections. And there is a period where it's kind of like synthesis synthetic stuff, but relatively early, you also
        started working with, appropriated sound samples and sample manipulation, right? Yup. Yup. But when I look at the dates of when that happened and I'm like really familiar with all the sampler technology, there's a mismatch because, because
        you are doing some of this stuff before, I feel like there was viable sampling technology to be able to do that kind of work. How were you, how were you approaching it? I want to talk more about, about the process you use to do this, but it's
        hard for me to even imagine like that there was a framework for you to even build this on. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Carl: </b>It's true. That my, my earliest work was strictly with synthesis. I was using the boot <span style="color:red" data-ts="1227.71" data-end_ts="1228.01" title="1227.71" id=c_"1227.71">__GLA__</span> synthesizers that were installed
      at Kelarts and that's what everyone was doing. That's what Subotnick was teaching. You know, it was dead rigor to the pieces on that compilation album. You mentioned are from that era 72 and 73, I guess. But what happened when I think about it,
      the first thing that happened was I was working with a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1250.53" data-end_ts="1250.77" title="1250.53" id=c_"1250.53">__time__</span> friend, someone I knew since junior high or high school, a guy by the name of
      Stephen wiser, who later became known professionally as Zev and Zev is known mostly as a kind of, action performer using percussion and a lot of found metals and things, you know, and coming from sort of a punk noise sensibility, but he's also,
      he was a very creative artist and, a poet, I don't remember, I think maybe he proposed, or somehow we had the idea to record his reading his own poetry, and that I would manipulate it with the tech, with the equipment in the studio.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Carl: </b>The synthesizers had a certain amount of, you know, they had some things you could do to modify, microphone collected sound and they were tape recorders and things like that. So I began to experiment with the techniques. I had
      heard a little bit of the tech sound poets, Lars gurnard Modine came through the school and introduced the idea of, tech sound poets working in sort of an extra lingual way with electronically manipulated voice. And so his lecture and my
      friend's impetus led me to experiment with, these microphone collected sound. And at the same time I was working at the music library at Cal arts and discovering all sorts of fantastic material, early music, pre Baroque music, 20th century,
      avant garde music, and a lot of world music. Cause <span style="color:red" data-ts="1352.38" data-end_ts="1352.83" title="1352.38" id=c_"1352.38">__Kelarts__</span> had a fantastic world music department and this was just a complete revelation.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Carl: </b>And somehow I just thought that it might be interesting to take, you know, the voice of this child singer from Burundi and record it and, and see what would happen if I looped it or did some other thing to it. So I began to
      experiment with those things, and that really started me on my path to the point where, you know, the sort of the first piece that I considered, the sort of my breakthrough piece from 1977 was a piece called <span style="color:red"
        data-ts="1390.48" data-end_ts="1390.75" title="1390.48" id=c_"1390.48">__sukkah__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1390.75" data-end_ts="1390.96" title="1390.75" id=c_"1390.75">__tie__</span>, which took an, an LP recording of a
      harpsichord music and just multiplied it again and again, to build up a, a very, very rich texture. So that, that kind of was the path from synthesis to using found, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1406.44" data-end_ts="1406.62"
        title="1406.44" id=c_"1406.44">__set__</span>, found sound.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Sure, sure. That makes sense. Now, were you using like a physical tape loops? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Carl: </b>Yes. Everything was done with tape. Everything was done with tape until, until the late eighties. Well, everything was done with tape until maybe 1982, at which point I started to work with a digital delay harmonizer, box called a
      <span style="color:red" data-ts="1428.74" data-end_ts="1429.09" title="1428.74" id=c_"1428.74">__***<inaudible>***__</span> song, which I acquired and used for live performance with a stack of the LP records in a turntable. But up to that
      point, you know, I did, you know, I worked a reel to reel tapes in the studio. And then when I did live performances, I worked with cassettes and, you know, did pieces and like <span style="color:red" data-ts="1448.24" data-end_ts="1448.57"
        title="1448.24" id=c_"1448.24">__cookie__</span> one, which is also on that, anthology, which is all cause that recordings that I made well on tour and, and the tour was such that every day in the daytime I would record sounds from whatever
      city I was in Belgium or Paris or wherever I was. And then I would incorporate those recordings plus all the recordings from previous days on the tour into a performance. And so the piece would significantly evolve
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Over time. Yeah. Wow. That's cool. So what, what had you doing all this traveling? Was it literally touring to perform performing these works? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Carl: </b>Yeah. At the time in eyes, I was fairly aggressive and, and, sent a lot of, to get letters out to Europe. And so on just, saying, hi, my name's Carlstone, is there any chance I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1502.08"
        data-end_ts="1502.2" title="1502.08" id=c_"1502.08">__get__</span> to do a performance and, you know, 90% of the people rubbed back either? No, and they didn't write back at all, but you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1511.32"
        data-end_ts="1511.44" title="1511.32" id=c_"1511.32">__the__</span> kind of scale, you know, I did a first tour. I don't remember exactly where I went, but it was not insignificant, especially for a guy who was, the 28, 29 in a market that is
      completely different from today. Yeah. You know, played in Holland, France, Spain, Germany, Italy.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>And this was, this is mostly performances in academic environments </i>
    </p>

      so they, they gave me a couple of concerts and I also did radio, you know, because I, I was working as a music director of a radio station at the time. And so I kind of played that card as well. And so I would go and do lectures on new music
      from California, new electronic music from California and introduce artists like, oh, like John Bishop and, Paul Drescher, Maggie <span style="color:red" data-ts="1584.02" data-end_ts="1585.03" title="1584.02" id=c_"1584.02">__Payne__</span>
      and people like that. Right. Right
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Now, one of the things, you know, and we talked about it right at the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1592.14" data-end_ts="1592.83" title="1592.14" id=c_"1592.14">__frontend__</span>, that, a lot of what you're known for is
        working with, with found or appropriated sounds in, particularly with, working with what, the way I would say is it's like the space between, granular and looping and it's like this other thing that's sort of like stuttering or high
        repetition stuff, but where you can, you know, there's still a significant amount of the, of the actual sound to be understood. Now your range of the range of things that you used for as source material is all over the map. I mean, there's on
        one hand, it's like, it sounded to me, like you saying, test 1, 2, 3. And it was actually funny because, you know, when you first listened to it, it's you hear two and then you hear tooth and then all of a sudden you realize, oh, okay, that's
        actually part of Tesla, two, three. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>And, and it becomes, it actually has kind of this neat narrative flow to it. Right. But in other cases, you're using, you're using musical tracks. Sometimes they sound like pop music. Sometimes they sound like world music.
        What I'm really curious. What, what is it that in your mind, when you hear something says that would be good source material, or is it just experimentation or is it just like I happened to be in Antwerp today and the sound of Antwerp was like
        this, and here's the sound sound of the piece? I mean, I, I'm curious what draws, what makes you say that's the source? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Carl: </b>That's what I'm trying to find out is what, what it is that has fascinated me about some piece of music that I've heard, whether I've heard it, you know, coming up, randomly on a playlist somewhere, or whether I've heard it, you
      know, walking around on the street and it's playing as background music in a, in a store, something will catch my year. And I won't know what it is actually, but I know that it's something and the process of figuring out what that something is,
      is the process of making the music. Got it. So what I, what I think my music does in a way is, attempts to sort of microscopically examine what's going on in a piece of music, or just a sample, a phrase of music, or just a note itself what's
      going on in that unit that has got me intrigued and finding the answer is basically composing the piece. So I don't care. You know, my, my tastes are fairly broad and it's not necessarily music that I respect it just as music that I love
      somehow. And the two things are different. In fact, I made kind of a matrix, a two dementia, two by two matrix of music. I love and respect music. I love, but don't respect music that I respect, but don't love and music that I neither love no
      respect. And, you know, I can fill those, those, quadrants in
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Your pieces pretty well, speckled throughout all four quadrants, </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Carl: </b>Well, music that I neither love or respect. You usually doesn't make it. Okay. Unless I, unless I've been, you know, commissioned to do a re, in which case, you know, I'm, I'm a whore I'll do, but, but no, I mean, it's usually, I
      mean, the love is the most important thing, of course, and, but it's, it's, it's very hard to quantify. I mean, I've got, I've figured out some things about, music that I'm attracted to, but they're not universal. And really the, the process of
      figuring out why I like something is, is, why I choose to deal with it in the first place as a, as a musical sample. But also, I mean, that's one thing, but another thing is working with iconic music as I have done from time to time, there's a
      kind of philosophical level and a level of sort of a postmodernist approach of deconstruction of the familiar, to create something new.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Carl: </b>And so if you hear a Ariana Grande, they sample, or you hear Motown and you hear it radically reconfigured, you're using the original as a reference point. And that has given you certain guidances as to how to interpret what I'm
      doing and, you know, for, for better or worse. And so in that way, I see myself very much coming from a postmodernist tradition. As I had mentioned, I grew up in California, the California, w both the light artists, people working with light
      like, James Tarell or, some of the other light artists, but also the, the postmodernist from the U S like Rauschenberg or even Duchamp and, people working with a pop icon, graphy, and we fashioning it into their own, you know, was very
      interesting for me. So that's happening at another level as well. Right.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Sure. Okay. That makes a lot of sense. Now, if I were to talk about how I feel like your, like, your music has changed over the years, I feel like a lot of the sort of like ways that you explore the music are similar, but in a
        way the sources have changed. One of the things, I guess, one of the things I would say is that your current music seems a lot more PR oriented around percussion and percussive sounds than I felt like earlier work was. Do you think that, does
        that, does that sound writer through, am I misreading this misreading it, well, I don't know. That's just not part of even your consideration. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Carl: </b>It hasn't been part of my active and maybe on a subconscious level, something that's happening. So you're saying there's more percussion now than before it
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Feels that way to me. Yes. You know, I think of stuff like, well, I've been listening to his stolen car a bit in in fact that's become kind of a, I listened to it while I'm bicycling, which, which makes for a very interesting
        soundtrack for my neighborhood. Right. But, </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Carl: </b>You're not using headphones. You're just blasting it out. No, I'm using headphones, but nevertheless,
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>It's still, for me, it's a, it's an interesting soundtrack and, you know, there's, certainly there's, there's a lot of percussion, a lot of, kind of typical percussion with your manipulation of the sound onto it. You know,
        that's not what I, that's not what I tend to think. I tend to think of somebody who, older stuff as being a lot more explorations into voice and vocal sounds, stuff like that. I think there's still some of that now, but, this Picasso stuff is
        just something that, to me seems more, more current. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Carl: </b>Well, it's true that there is a strong, rhythmic impetus to a lot of the music on this stolen car release. And a lot of the samples that I use come from pop, which as, you know, a lot of drums or whatever. So that's inevitable, but
      there's a lot of voice too. Yeah. I think a lot of female voice I've always been attracted to the voice, especially female voice for some reason. And while earlier pieces like Fanta Sri or shin QI, both based on female voice have really no
      percussion, no drums. It's true that in stolen car it's voice plus drums. So in that sense, I think, I think you're right, but it's not a conscious decision that I made. You know, I, I just kind of, I don't set out to say, okay, today I'm going
      to use a piece with a lot of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2084.56" data-end_ts="2084.95" title="2084.56" id=c_"2084.56">__drum__</span>. This is my drama album. I drum album. I, I never do that. I simply, you know, kind of follow the news
      and whatever hits me in the morning will be something that I'll be taking apart, you know, later in the day. Got it. And, I guess more recently it's been a more pop that's for sure. And with pop comes drums, and there's just no way around that,
      I guess. Yeah. Right.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>So from my perspective, you are kind of on the forefront of playing around with this, with samples in the way that you did. I mean, there was, there's obviously the music and crap people and stuff like that that had come
        before you, in terms of working with, with recorded sound manipulation. But, there wasn't, I didn't know who were people that influenced you and who are people that still influence you from an art standpoint? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Carl: </b>Early on when I was a student Subotnick was an influence through his synthesizer work. James Kenney was also a teacher of mine. He was also an important kind of theoretician. And he had done a kind of breakout piece that I have
      most people don't know, but, used Elvis samples is a piece called blue suede. And he used the Elvis blue suede shoes and cut it up and looped in and did things like that. And I thought some going on there, that's interesting then Charles
      Armour, Connie Ann came through the school and introduced the tech sound people, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2178.92" data-end_ts="2179.03" title="2178.92" id=c_"2178.92">__and__</span> sort of the Lars gunner Dean. There was one German,
      by the name of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2184.51" data-end_ts="2184.74" title="2184.51" id=c_"2184.51">__fair__</span> Denine, Creve it who was recorded. He, he came to New York and just recorded a lot of television sound and refashioned
      it into a piece called voice of America. And, I recently started rediscovered the piece I had kinda, it was, it was important piece for me back in the day, but I, I thought about it recently and dug it out.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>What was the name of the piece, again, voice of </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Carl: </b>America, voice of America. I have to look it up, is like Ferdinand Creve. It is K R I w E T. These pieces were influential. I found <span style="color:red" data-ts="2228.24" data-end_ts="2228.3" title="2228.24"
        id=c_"2228.24">__know__</span> Steve <span style="color:red" data-ts="2228.59" data-end_ts="2229.17" title="2228.59" id=c_"2228.59">__***<inaudible>***__</span> and Phil glass both came through Cal arts and did performances with their
      ensembles right there in, in the central atrium, the music, so-called music gallery or gallery space at Cal arts. That was very influential, the worst. Some of the world musicians that were brought by the music department, chic <span
        style="color:red" data-ts="2251.67" data-end_ts="2252.06" title="2251.67" id=c_"2251.67">__Cheena__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2252.06" data-end_ts="2252.75" title="2252.06" id=c_"2252.06">__Milana__</span> came through use of
      Narda Swaran performer and totally blew my mind. Fantastic stuff. So these were all influential. Did I mention Bernard Parmegiani? I should, because he, his music touched me very deeply from all the people from the GRM use my <span
        style="color:red" data-ts="2273.54" data-end_ts="2273.72" title="2273.54" id=c_"2273.54">__fit__</span>, my favorite composer. So, so I knew a bit about musical credits. You know, it was sort of part of the history courses that I took at
      Kelarts and also just familiarizing myself, but I didn't really study them in a way.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Carl: </b>And then, you know, by the time I started working with my pop samples, my Motown, things like that, you know, hip hop and rap were happening on the east coast and maybe in LA, too, but I had zero awareness of it. I was working with
      turntables, I was cutting them up, looping them with my stereo digital delay, you know, I didn't, who is Grandmaster flash, you know, I had no idea. And of course they, those guys didn't know anything about me. Right? <span style="color:red"
        data-ts="2319.89" data-end_ts="2320.11" title="2319.89" id=c_"2319.89">__Like__</span> guys, you know, I mean, people were starting to turn to the media as source material. You know, this was a big turning point in 83, 84 and so on for a lot
      of people. And by then sampling technology was just starting to take hold. I think that by, I don't know when it was 85 or so commercial samplers were starting to hit the market. There was, expensive ones, like I'm blanking on the name, but,
      well, the Synclavier of course was everybody knew, but nobody could afford right. Then there was a
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i><span style="color:red" data-ts="2358.16" data-end_ts="2358.46" title="2358.16" id=c_"2358.16">__Fair__</span> light and then the emulator </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Carl: </b>An emulator. Okay. So that was kind of getting into the realm of affordability. And then by the time, you know, I had the stereo digital delay and it was a pretty expensive machine. It cost about what a car would cost at the time,
      $5,000. You could buy it, you could buy a Honda civic for 5,000, but I got a grant to buy one, and then I got stolen. And so I, I use the insurance money to buy another one and then it got stolen. And then I said to hell with it. And by then,
      this was 1986 by then Mitty had arrived, a portable Macintosh was on sale and like a Mac plus. And so I took my $5,000 or whatever it was. I bought a Mac, I bought a prophet 2002 sampler. I bought a Yamaha, TX eight, 16, and a Dex seven. And
      that's really was kind of the turning point.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Carl: </b>That's where I developed the pieces that I brought out of my first CD thing called four pieces, which had the original recording of shin <span style="color:red" data-ts="2427.34" data-end_ts="2427.82" title="2427.34"
        id=c_"2427.34">__QI__</span>, and, some other, you know, Mitty pieces. And that was 19 86, 87. The influences that I had by then, and I had listened a little bit to, you know, there was a group called the art of noise. They were using either
      a fair light or an emulator, I don't know. And they use these short little musical samples, like just like the opening three notes of the Peter Gunn, television theme. And people were like, oh, wow. They're not just using like a sample of a
      note, they're using a whole phrase.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Wow.</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Carl: </b>And so I'll see your phrase and I'll raise you the whole piece, which was kind of my concept,
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>But nobody folded. Right. So now, you said that your current listening, tastes are pretty broad, but I mean, what now, if you got stuck on a desert island, inexplicably, a stereo and like five albums, who would you, whose work
        would you pick now? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Carl: </b>It's a tricky question. Yeah. And that really requires side because <span style="color:red" data-ts="2510.68" data-end_ts="2510.76" title="2510.68" id=c_"2510.68">__I__</span>, you know, there's music that I love. Let's, we'll
      limit it to music. I love and respect. I think would be reasonable, but music that would also stand, just the test of many, many repeated listenings. So probably you have to be <span style="color:red" data-ts="2524.36" data-end_ts="2524.81"
        title="2524.36" id=c_"2524.36">__Bach__</span> a lot of Bach in there. I would think of Ray Goldberg variations would probably be in there. And, what I consider to be the classic Philip Glass, like music, music, and 12 pounds,
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>You know, I w I was going to say in my head, I was thinking, I bet Phil glass is going to be one of those. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Carl: </b>I, I could, listen to that for, for many years until I got rescued. Sure. You know, I don't know. I'd have to think a little more about what the other three would be, but, not my own music. Well, maybe no, I don't think I would
      include my own.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>So unfortunately our time is already up, but I have one very important question to ask you before we go, what's up with you and food. So first of all, I'm not a big fan of Facebook, but I have, I keep up on it and I have a
        very carefully curated group of friends in that. Almost none of them will do pictures of food. So whenever I see a plate of food come across, I know it's coming from you. But also my understanding is like the name of a lot of the, a lot of
        the pieces, especially early pieces were like named after your favorite restaurants or something. All of them. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2609.32" data-end_ts="2609.5" title="2609.32" id=c_"2609.32">__Yeah__</span>. Stupid idea that,
      </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Carl: </b>Well basically, well, to get back to, you know, the, the medic question, what's up with food. I love food, love to eat it. I love to chew it. I love to look at it. And, and I'm just, I, I'm a person who really enjoys good food, so
      there's that, but, as it ties into my music, to the extent it does, or to my titles, I was, you know, struggling with titles back in the early days, you know, trying to come up with a way to sort of represent a piece, in, in words that, you
      know, had, you know, the, the title of the piece would have some relation, some clues, some insight into the music itself. And I really just had a rough time with that. And so I thought, well, I need maybe a more arbitrary system, just, you
      know, give each piece a number or yeah, just call it like a two number, you know, Opus, whatever.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Carl: </b>And that really wasn't very satisfying either. And plus it really wouldn't help people distinguish, you know, titles are just kind of markers, they're signifiers. And so, you know, I was in, this is <span style="color:red"
        data-ts="2692.35" data-end_ts="2692.64" title="2692.35" id=c_"2692.35">__nine__</span>. I think I started doing the 74, 75, something like that. And I was eating even Nan. And I was like, really into like, so-called ethnic food. Like Thai
      food had just started to become a thing in Los Angeles. The Thai community was coming into its own. They had opened up these restaurants. The food was a revelation. I really liked it, especially when they were just creating a food for the Thai
      clientele. And so I thought, well, you know, I love this restaurant. And so I think probably I just gave my piece that title of the, you know, child Priya, which is also the name of river in, in Thailand. And then I gave another piece of name
      of another restaurant. And then I thought, well, this is kind of a good arbitrary system. It's random. I can randomize it. I'll just create a sort of a database of the places I've gone to that I, like most of them are Asian anyway. So the
      titles don't have any inherent meaning to a Western audience, right. Like Daniel, John, or say John, or cook hill Quan or <span style="color:red" data-ts="2762.7" data-end_ts="2763.66" title="2762.7" id=c_"2762.7">__layover__</span> or child
      Priya. Well, and
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>It's also, it's divorced from that source material too. So there's a bit of mystery involved. Yeah, </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Carl: </b>That's right. And there's no connection, there's no tie music in, you know, the piece called child pre-op right. And so I just, I started doing it and then I did, it's where it was working for me and I've never stopped. The only
      thing that's happened really is that, you know, as I continue to fill up my database, it's not just Asian restaurants. And so, you know, you'll have a piece called moms or Dad berries or something that, it, it, it can happen. But, I think that was one of them. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's a great pub. You should try it. I
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Think I will try it next time in London. Well, you know, the other thing I would say is that connection to food. And again, like on Facebook, seeing the plates and stuff, there's something about that that just like really
        communicates a joy of life too. And I have to say that I really appreciate that. And I appreciate, I appreciate the joy that you've brought to my life. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Carl: </b>Oh, wow. Wow. That's really nice to hear. Thank you. All right. Well with that, I
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Am going to, I'm going to say goodbye. I want to thank you so much for taking the time they have this chat. </i>
