<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, today I have a very special guest. His name is Tony Rolando. He is the, big chieftain behind, make Noise Music, the people that make some my favorite modular gear in the world. And he is involved in a lot of stuff. I'm gonna let him kind of tell us about it. So with that, I'll introduce him. Hi, Tony. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony Rolando: </b>I'm good. How you do, how you doing this morning, Darwin? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm doing great. It's a beautiful day. I'm, I'm loving this fall weather with all the sunshine and stuff. We're having it pretty nice up here in, in Minnesota. How are things down in North Carolina? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Sunny, but cold, but probably not as cold as it is up there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That might be true. That might be true. Let's start off by having you describe what it is that you do, because I labeled you a chieftain already, which is, probably a new one. I'm not sure I've heard anyone else call you a chieftain, so I've got that on my crown. But why don't you tell us a little bit about what you do? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Well, I can guess technically I, I'm the founder here at Make Noisey, where we design and build synthesizer modules and now, standalone synthesizers as well, and of course, modular synthesizer systems. At one time, I, I did it all. I basically sat in a spare room in a house in Marshall, North Carolina, which is about 25 miles north of here, of Asheville here, out in the middle of nowhere. And I had days where I was working on designs, days where I was building stuff and testing stuff, and days where I was packing and shipping at that time, which was about eight or nine years ago. I, I never, in my wildest dreams thought that I would end up with a, my own office in a, building in West Asheville with, anywhere from 10 to to 14 people working to do all those same things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>So today I have people who work with me and help me with design and people who work with me and help me with production and, and shipping and sales, the whole thing. And, and really, if you, if you wanna talk about who the chief is around here, that that will be Kelly Cowbell. She's the one that, that propelled the business to where it's at now. She handles all the, the top, you know, level management and sales and stuff like that. She hires, she fires. Really, at this point, most of what I do is development and then helping the production line stay up and running, because if you know anything about trying to manufacture something, you, you know, it's not for the faint of heart. And then when you start trying to manufacture analog stuff, even the digital stuff that we make is still quite analog. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>There's a lot of, a lot, a lot of knobs and buttons and jacks and stuff on it. So it's just a lot of parts on everything. There's a lot of places where things can go wrong. So every day is full of surprises on the production line, and I've gotta be around to help, smooth out those bumps in the road for the crew that's building and testing <span style="color:red" data-ts="195.245" data-end_ts="195.525" title="195.245" id=c_"195.245">__this__</span> stuff down there. So, so today most of my work is split between development on one hand and, and then, keeping the production line, you know, you know, problem solving, putting out fires on the production line on a day-to-Day basis. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I grew up in a manufacturing environment. My father, was a QA manager at a place that made big metal farm machinery, which is a lot different from manufacturing, modules and little standalone systems. Tell me a little bit about what your production system looks like. Do you have a whole pick <span style="color:red" data-ts="228.485" data-end_ts="228.685" title="228.485" id=c_"228.485">__and__</span> place system? Do you have all of that machinery in-house? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>No. There was a point, maybe I know maybe like five or six years ago where I was looking at doing that. And, at that point Kelly had just come on as a 50% owner of Make Noise and she was gonna start managing the business, and we had a chat about that and, and she really felt strongly that that would cut into my time doing development. And I think she was probably right. Friends of mine who'd taken that route, such as Josh Holly up at Malco. And, and Will over at WMD told me there was a good two years where they were basically getting their pick and place line set up and, and, getting all that up and running, it's an art, it's a, it's, it's an art to get a pick and place line running smoothly and to keep it running smoothly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>And, you know, we really don't do the kind of volume that you need to make something like that worthwhile, which is why you'll also see Josh and, and will now produce several of the other, smaller eurorack company products. I don't know the whole list, but I'm sure they'd be glad to talk to you about it. So, no, we still use CMMS that are based here in the us. We have one in, in Atlanta and one out on the west coast in la. And, we're, in toss with a third one up in Virginia. We basically, we get all the job files all sorted and perfect and, and communicate with them what we need. And they send us finished, built forwards. They, they just do it a lot better than we ever could. The place down in Atlanta is, it's topnotch. I mean, <span style="color:red" data-ts="329.845" data-end_ts="330.045" title="329.845" id=c_"329.845">__they__</span>, they just, they've got everything down there, man, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="332.845" data-end_ts="333.005" title="332.845" id=c_"332.845">__they__</span>, the lines run so fast. It's actually kind of a fun place to visit because it really kind of feels like you're watching a miracle take place right when you see one of the boards built. It's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting, and I actually think you're fairly smart for not, not taking that on. I know, I had the opportunity to go visit Will and, see his operation in place and it's fantastic. It's really an amazing thing he's put together, but then a part of the business becomes keeping the line full, you know, by <span style="color:red" data-ts="363.715" data-end_ts="364.005" title="363.715" id=c_"363.715">__find__</span>, finding other customers work and stuff like that. And I'm kind of, in a way, I'm kind of glad to hear that you've, you've kept your focus on design. That's, that seems really smart. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Yeah. Yeah. No, and design and just keeping, you know, the rest of our production process running, you know, that that's part I didn't really get into, you know, once these products land here, once these vendors deliver, you know, for example, the finished boards, and then we have a shop in, you know, metal photo of, Cincinnati Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> out of Ohio. We ship us the metalwork and, a shop called Rogan that's just outside of, Chicago, Illinois, that makes the knobs. All those things converge on, four 14 Haywood Road in Asheville, North Carolina, <laugh>. And we've got a crew here, those individual pieces and builds them up into, modules or, or zero coast and standalone synthesizes in this case now. And, and then they have to test them. And, and man, the testing is really, I don't think people will understand just how much time it takes to test every potential fail that could happen in a given module. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Every knob button, jack, LED, and it, it, it really can <laugh>, it takes quite a while actually on something like a <span style="color:red" data-ts="434.485" data-end_ts="434.725" title="434.485" id=c_"434.485">__match__</span> where you've got 20 something jacks and 10 knobs and two buttons, it's a, it's a lot, it takes a lot of time. So we still do quite a bit of work here. <span style="color:red" data-ts="443.625" data-end_ts="443.845" title="443.625" id=c_"443.625">__We__</span>, we just don't do the soldering, right, unless there's a problem. When there's a problem, then it gets pulled off of the production line and, and, it gets steered over to, Devin, who's our, technician, who does all the rework. Unless he gets stumped, then he might come up to my office and we might troubleshoot something together. But generally he gets it and then it goes back and starts <span style="color:red" data-ts="463.465" data-end_ts="463.685" title="463.465" id=c_"463.465">__the__</span> process all over again, gets rebuilt, backed up and put through quality control, and hopefully makes it all the way over to that shipping table where it gets wrapped in some pretty pink bubble wrap and put into a white box that's stamped make noise. We have to have so many different sizes of boxes for all the different little modules that, we can't make the quantities needed to get a custom stamped box affordably. So we still hands stamp all of Ty. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Now, it's, interesting that you talk about the testing process because I imagine especially something like the mass, not only are you, do you have to check to make sure the lights light up and all this stuff, but in something like that, you have to check to make sure that the ranges on all of the controls are, you know, properly inverting or properly attenuating that you're getting the right output levels and all that stuff. It was something like a mass. How long does it take from the time you have a populated board on a face plate to the time that it's ready to ship, how much, how much handling time is required to really do that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>You know, it's funny, it's funny you ask that because this is the kind of stuff that we just started tracking and, and, and this is, again, this is kind of where Kelly is really kind of changing how we work here. We kind of <span style="color:red" data-ts="537.605" data-end_ts="537.805" title="537.605" id=c_"537.605">__got__</span> to this point where we had hired some people to help, and then we were still struggling sometimes. And so we hired some more people and then we were still struggling to meet orders and, and, and it kind of got to this thing where we had to stop and look and say, well, is it just that our order numbers are, are growing so fast that we just have to keep expanding the business? Or is it that we're not working at full capacity? And so we had it, we actually just, I know it seems crazy, but we just started tracking stuff like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>As part of what we're having, our, one of the newest, members of our crew, John King, who's our production manager now, is, actually tracking time from, you know, delivery to when it gets on the shelf, ready to go out as a finished product on something like the maths. It's funny because we used to know, we thought we knew how long it took. And what we realized is that when we were timing people, they work really fast, <laugh>. And then when you just get into the standard flow workflow of a, of any given day of the week, things slow down quite a bit because people are kind of settling into the flow and they might be chatting a little bit. And we do want it to be an enjoyable place to work, so we're not gonna be cracking the whip all day long. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>And so that's where actually taking maybe a wider, you know, as you, you probably know, you've gotta collect data over a wider range of time and look, you know, come up with an average, right? Because our, our times were all wrong. Everything was <span style="color:red" data-ts="627.325" data-end_ts="627.525" title="627.325" id=c_"627.325">__taken__</span> longer than <span style="color:red" data-ts="628.205" data-end_ts="628.325" title="628.205" id=c_"628.205">__the__</span> thought it should have, but it was because we'd say, okay, we're gonna time how long it takes to make a mass, and then everyone would just be <span style="color:red" data-ts="634.045" data-end_ts="634.245" title="634.045" id=c_"634.045">__worth__</span> to make the best possible time. But then when we'd actually build, you know, 20 or 30 <span style="color:red" data-ts="638.745" data-end_ts="638.965" title="638.745" id=c_"638.745">__mat__</span> on an afternoon, we'd notice it would take a lot longer. So we're still figuring that out. Actually, I know it seems crazy, but this is one of the ways that we're growing and the reason we're figuring it out is, <span style="color:red" data-ts="649.405" data-end_ts="649.525" title="649.405" id=c_"649.405">__is__</span> we're trying to figure out do we need to hire more people or do we need to improve our process? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Which I think is, is kind of an important thing to know, is if you hire too many people, then next thing you know, you don't have enough work for 'em, and you might have to lay one of 'em off. And I really don't <span style="color:red" data-ts="662.805" data-end_ts="663.005" title="662.805" id=c_"662.805">__wanna__</span> have to do that. 'cause I've worked at places where I've been laid off and it just, it feels terrible, right? Because you, you, you don't wanna leave a job, but at the same time, you kind of need a job <laugh>, right? So we're trying to avoid getting into that kind of situation by tracking stuff and seeing, well, if we added one more person and one more test station, you know, a test station might cost us a couple grand to add, you know, the outfit with a scope and a DBM and a test system and so on and so forth, a chair and all that stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Well, if we add this and this, then we could actually make our orders by this month or whatever. You know, it gets pretty complicated to be honest with you. And it's not anything I ever thought I'd be thinking about really. <laugh>, <laugh>, I gotta be honest. It's just not. But luckily there's folks like, like Kelly and and John who do think about that stuff, and that's kind of where their <span style="color:red" data-ts="711.015" data-end_ts="711.365" title="711.015" id=c_"711.015">__skill__</span> sets lie. That's where they, they get excited about figuring stuff like that out. And so, really my work with them is more just pointing them in the right direction. Oh, well, we need to outfit a new test station. You know, that gets me excited because then I <span style="color:red" data-ts="723.885" data-end_ts="724.005" title="723.885" id=c_"723.885">__get__</span>, get to buy a new oscilloscope, which everyone loves buying Oscilloscopes <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's great. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>To answer your question. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It does. It's cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="732.945" data-end_ts="733.165" title="732.945" id=c_"732.945">__No__</span>, but I bet John knows, I bet John is, is working on a figure right now that he will, you know, hopefully Tell me about sometime soon, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, it's, it's interesting to talk about a, because I come from this background, so it kind of, I, I still get a kick out of seeing stuff made, right? There's something like you said, Mm-Hmm, <affirmative>, there's something almost magical about seeing stuff get made, right? But I also think it's useful to talk about, you know, the realities of doing a small modular business because you are actually, you have, you're kind of at this conundrum point, and I think a lot of people, you know, within the modular community, you're one of the big manufacturers, right? You produce, you, you turn a lot of quantity of the, the work that you do in relative terms. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative>. But I think people are, would find it interesting that, you know, even as one of the bigger dogs in the industry, it's still a small enough business that it makes more sense to stamp your boxes than getting them manufactured. And that it's, you're actually not that far away from like still building them on your kitchen table, right. That it's, you know, it's, it's that kind of, industry still at this point. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Yeah. Yeah. You're, yeah, you're a hundred percent right. It, it's funny because I, I find that people either think, you know, we get visitors here more and more often, and I find that people either think we're way smaller than they imagine, or we're way bigger than they manage. It's matching. It's rare that they, they're, they come in and they think, oh, well, this is exactly what I thought it would be like. Right. Because like you said, we, we are one of the larger modular synthesizer companies out there, but at the end of the day, our company is smaller than 15 people, which as you probably know, coming from your, your background where your father worked, QA at what was probably a much larger company, 15 people is a small company. You know, I can still, I can still say hello to everyone in my company on the way in to work in the morning and under three minutes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Right. <laugh>, you know, <laugh>, really small company, and you're right, it's still, it people, it seems really big to people who are in it because they're so excited about it. And they're in this, this Eurorack bubble where they're, they're on the forums and they're on Facebook talking about it, and they think everyone I know is into this stuff. But the reality is, you know, we make, I, I guess what dealers have told me is one of the most popular modules they've ever stock, which is maps, you know, there's still, there's, there's somewhere around 5,000 maps in the whole world. Uhhuh, <affirmative> the whole world, you know, that's, that's nothing, right? The whole world of musicians, you know, all the musicians in the world, there's certain portion of them that play with electronic musical instruments and that certain portion of that certain portion, we have 5,000 of them. And, you know, then you're <span style="color:red" data-ts="903.645" data-end_ts="903.685" title="903.645" id=c_"903.645">__gonna__</span> even take into account the people who have two maps. Right. <laugh>. So the customer base is still pretty small on <span style="color:red" data-ts="910.805" data-end_ts="910.925" title="910.805" id=c_"910.805">__a__</span>, when you look at it from, from real terms like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Or if you take a look at it like, you know, for, for a company like say, Corg making 5,000 is like a hiccup. Right? Right. And so it's, it is a different, it's, it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="925.725" data-end_ts="925.805" title="925.725" id=c_"925.725">__a__</span> different leg of the industry, but certainly one that for those of us in the bubble is really exciting. Now, you talk about focusing on design. Do you do the electronic design? Do you do the product design or both? And has that been the case all along? I mean, did you start off doing the circuit design, or how did you get into the design part of this, and what is that to you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>To me, design starts with conceptualizing, you know, coming up with an idea for a module or for a synthesizer instrument. And so to me, conceptualizing <span style="color:red" data-ts="960.545" data-end_ts="960.765" title="960.545" id=c_"960.545">__is__</span> the first step. And, and then after that, you've gotta get some hardware going. I've always done the conceptualizing. I write a description of operation. I do now collaborate with some people, even on the conceptualization. But for example, the work that we do with, with Tom Herb, Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> I would say is, is more of a collaboration. So for example, when we work on a module, I mean, sometimes I come to Tom and say, Hey, I really wanna make something that's like this, and it should do this and this and this. But I find that with Tom, he and I have such similar aesthetics that I often find that myself riffing with him more than just telling him what we want to build. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>So in that case, in the case of those sound hack make noise modules, I really feel like those are a collaboration in every way, both in, in the conceptualization of the, of the instrument and then in the, final product. So for example, I would design the, the hardware and, and, and collaborate with Tom on the conceptualization. Tom would design the, the DSP algorithms and implement them. He would write the firmware on other products. You know, anything that's a hundred percent analog, like the DPO is pretty much just gonna be, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1035.205" data-end_ts="1035.325" title="1035.205" id=c_"1035.205">__I__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1035.325" data-end_ts="1035.605" title="1035.325" id=c_"1035.325">__gonna__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1035.605" data-end_ts="1035.965" title="1035.605" id=c_"1035.605">__design__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1035.965" data-end_ts="1036.085" title="1035.965" id=c_"1035.965">__the__</span>, I'm gonna conceptualizing it and then design the hardware. And then, of course, also I'm leaving out one big important step <span style="color:red" data-ts="1042.105" data-end_ts="1042.325" title="1042.105" id=c_"1042.105">__is__</span> the beta testers. So in some ways, I feel like beta testers are a really, really important step in design too. So in that case, I, I manage beta testers, I guess you could say at this point. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>I, I, I have like five or six people on a product, and I'm just taking in their emails and kind of processing them and trying to figure out where the redundancies are and what's a real problem versus what's just a pilot error and or perhaps core design bringing upon us the pilot era. Right. And so in that way, I also feel like there's some collaboration with beta testers that we work with, in the development of a, of a new, instrument. So, yeah, I guess I do do the hardware design and, and I do do the conceptualization, but at this point, I think <span style="color:red" data-ts="1086.795" data-end_ts="1087.085" title="1086.795" id=c_"1086.795">__Make__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1087.115" data-end_ts="1087.405" title="1087.115" id=c_"1087.115">__Meno__</span> is, is quite collaborative with the folks that we work with, like Tom Orb, our beta testing crew, Walker Farrell, who works for us, he does all of our videos, is, one of our most important beta testers. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>He's usually first, the first, level beta testing, which is some of the hardest stuff to do, because that's when the product is just <laugh> barely limping off of the, off the laboratory table, you know what I mean? It's just, it's just barely working, but we, we gotta start testing it. And, and that's when we call <span style="color:red" data-ts="1115.005" data-end_ts="1115.165" title="1115.005" id=c_"1115.005">__on__</span> Walker. See also another firmware engineer. We worked with Matthew Sherwood, who we worked with on the Tempe and, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1122.195" data-end_ts="1122.485" title="1122.195" id=c_"1122.195">__MIDI__</span> for, zero Coast. He's also someone that, we collaborate with a bit. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1127.465" data-end_ts="1127.685" title="1127.465" id=c_"1127.465">__He__</span> didn't initially start like that with Matthew, but he's gotten more into modular synthesis. His time has passed. So I feel like he's been able to put more, more of himself into the work <span style="color:red" data-ts="1139.445" data-end_ts="1139.645" title="1139.445" id=c_"1139.445">__<inaudible>__</span> than when he first started. Okay.

You know, you got, he's using this stuff more and he's, I don't know, just <span style="color:red" data-ts="1149.965" data-end_ts="1150.125" title="1149.965" id=c_"1149.965">__come__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1150.125" data-end_ts="1150.285" title="1150.125" id=c_"1150.125">__to__</span> me sometimes with an idea, oh, hey, what if we did this? And sometimes they're good. So we, we go ahead and we use those ideas. So you end up kind of collaborating with everyone you work with. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1160.135" data-end_ts="1160.485" title="1160.135" id=c_"1160.135">__These__</span> people down on the crew, you know, just yesterday actually, Mike was, running Zero <span style="color:red" data-ts="1166.125" data-end_ts="1166.445" title="1166.125" id=c_"1166.125">__Coast__</span> and he found a bot and, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1168.465" data-end_ts="1168.685" title="1168.465" id=c_"1168.465">__and__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1168.685" data-end_ts="1168.885" title="1168.685" id=c_"1168.685">__some__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1168.885" data-end_ts="1169.005" title="1168.885" id=c_"1168.885">__media__</span> firmware. And, and I got call to come down the line and, and check it out. And so that way, even the, the crew that's building this stuff is, is kind of collaborating. They, I always tell 'em, you, you're the last set of eyes on this stuff. You're the guardians of the sound. And what I mean by that is that I can't listen to and, and check every unit that goes out the door at this point. But that said, I do really want them to work and operate and feel and sound this very specific way. And so I'm gonna teach you what that way is, and then I want you to be the guardian of that sound so that when stuff leaves <span style="color:red" data-ts="1205.825" data-end_ts="1206.045" title="1205.825" id=c_"1205.825">__the__</span> shop, it still has that special quality that we need it to have. And they always have to have their eyes open, and, and they do, they find stuff all the time. So, even the production crew, it's kind of, collaborating in the, the finished instrument that people are hopefully enjoying out there in the field. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, that's interesting. And it really points to the idea of having a vision for what you're wanting to do, which, is I think one of the keys to why Make Noise has seen the success that it has. I mean, there's, there's sort of like a, a way that the products seem to be all part of a vision that's really, really compelling and really, really awesome to see. Now I'm a little curious. One of the things I like to do in my podcast is talk to people about the backgrounds that they bring or their journey to where they got. And especially since you've come to this place where you do have, you have not only a company, but you've got this vision for a product, and it, it emanates in lots of different ways, the creation of the modules, but also the development of the shared system, and also development of the Zero Coast, and also the development of the label that produces shared system recordings. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, all these things are part of a vision. I'm curious about, how did you get started in both music and electronics, and how did that lead you to this place? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>I was initially just a, a musician that was curious about how <span style="color:red" data-ts="1301.365" data-end_ts="1301.605" title="1301.365" id=c_"1301.365">__stuff__</span> worked. I'm, even when I was a kid, I was one of those kids that would open it up, whatever I got, open it up and see what was inside. Even though I had no idea what I was looking at, I just wanted to look at it. And, and after a certain point, I think I, I had enough time on my hands to start maybe learning a bit about what was on the inside. And I was actually living in New York City at the time, and, and I hadn't really found my, my place in New York City yet. It's, it's tough in New York City. I think a lot of people could probably understand, what I mean by that. You get there and initially it seems like there's all this, opportunity, and then you realize actually it takes kind of a while to really, if you don't go there with, with already having something set. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, it can take a while to find your place in New York City to find your job, to find your, your friends, to find your places you'd like to go. All of it. I mean, it's just, it's just a very, very complex place to navigate. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="1359.885" data-end_ts="1360.005" title="1359.885" id=c_"1359.885">__I__</span>, and I had gotten there and really felt kind of lost and, and kind of lonely. And, and my partner, Kelly, was already kind of set into motion with her life there. And so I found myself at a lot of time, and I started going to the Brooklyn Public Library and reading their, reference library for, analog Electronics, which hadn't been touched <laugh> much in, in recent years at that point. So all the books were there. They had the whole, like analog devices library, a bunch of stuff by Bob <span style="color:red" data-ts="1389.365" data-end_ts="1389.685" title="1389.365" id=c_"1389.365">__piece__</span>. It's really kind of a, a cool collection of somewhat outdated, electrical engineering test that just happened to be of interest to me because I was interested in analog electronic Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b><affirmative>. And so I read the heck out of those <span style="color:red" data-ts="1401.685" data-end_ts="1401.965" title="1401.685" id=c_"1401.685">__office__</span>.

I bought a cheap oscilloscope. I just started trying to figure it out. At one point, Kelly asked me what it was that I, you know, where I was going with it, what I wanted to do. And I said, well, I, I, I really would like to work for, for either Moog or Ula. And, which is crazy to think, you know, but this is a while ago, right? Mogue hadn't made all the stuff that they've made now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>All they had at that point was the Voyager, so Right. They were a lot smaller company, and Ula was even less known than it is now. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1445.485" data-end_ts="1445.605" title="1445.485" id=c_"1445.485">__I__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1445.605" data-end_ts="1445.685" title="1445.605" id=c_"1445.605">__mean__</span>, it's not well known now, but it was very excu at that time. So it, it, it, at the time, it seemed like a pretty achievable goal, to be honest with you. And it, and it actually, it was because I, and I called Ula and they weren't hiring. That wasn't even, that conversation was quite quick <laugh>. But I also, I called <span style="color:red" data-ts="1462.645" data-end_ts="1462.765" title="1462.645" id=c_"1462.645">__him__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1462.765" data-end_ts="1462.965" title="1462.765" id=c_"1462.765">__up__</span>. I said, you know, I'm looking for a job. I, I'm, I'm learning analog electronics and I want to work for a place that makes synthesizers. The girl who answered the phone, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1470.045" data-end_ts="1470.245" title="1470.045" id=c_"1470.045">__who__</span> still works there, her name's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1471.125" data-end_ts="1471.485" title="1471.125" id=c_"1471.125">__Siobhan__</span>. She's a salesperson there, she's been there for many years. She says, well, we might be hiring, let me ask our, production manager lead. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>And he gets on the phone and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1479.725" data-end_ts="1479.805" title="1479.725" id=c_"1479.725">__he__</span> asked me a few questions. He said, well, can you come in for an interview? Sure. When, and then I bought a ticket and went down there and I interviewed and took a job working on the production line there. They were setting up to build little Fatties, but that was gravely delayed. So I ended up actually working with Amos, who was also still there doing warranty service and rework. It just kind of took off from there. I just learned a lot while I was working there. Not so much about how circuits work as much as how manufacturing works, like what it takes to make that analog synthesizer <span style="color:red" data-ts="1514.405" data-end_ts="1514.685" title="1514.405" id=c_"1514.405">__that__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1514.875" data-end_ts="1515.165" title="1514.875" id=c_"1514.875">__most__</span> is <span style="color:red" data-ts="1515.445" data-end_ts="1515.725" title="1515.445" id=c_"1515.445">__time__</span> a thousand times in a row, and have it be really good every single time.

</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>And that's really what I took away from there. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1527.545" data-end_ts="1527.765" title="1527.545" id=c_"1527.545">__And__</span>, you know, seeing the folks in engineering at that time, the, which, Cyril their lead engineer, and, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1535.765" data-end_ts="1535.965" title="1535.765" id=c_"1535.765">__<inaudible>__</span> was their CBD, who's still there.

There was only 20 people there when I was working there. And it was really, really kind of relaxed atmosphere. And I could just walk into engineering whenever I wanted and just kind of look over people's shoulders and see what they were doing. And I feel like I really learned a lot just seeing how they did what they did back in engineering and seeing how the production line worked. Learned a lot about how to respect customers and how to deal with them and keep 'em happy. I think that's part of Mo's success. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Keeping customers happy. They <span style="color:red" data-ts="1570.285" data-end_ts="1570.445" title="1570.285" id=c_"1570.285">__had__</span>, they had a good technical support program there that led me to a point where I wanted to make modules. And at the time, modular hadn't really, it wasn't really very popular. So, you know, when I talked to the folks at <span style="color:red" data-ts="1582.125" data-end_ts="1582.325" title="1582.125" id=c_"1582.125">__MO__</span> about modules, they weren't really interested. So I had this dream of either getting into doing, freelance, printed circuit board design, or, making modules. And I set off to try and do both. Of course, no one would hire me to design a circuit board because I didn't have a portfolio. Right. So making the modules was kind of an attempt to build a portfolio of, circuit board designs, I think used to get other jobs doing printed circuit board design. But then modular kind of started growing and it's just, it seemed like that was the direction life was headed. So I, I let it take me that way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What were the first module designs that you put together? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>The first ones were really small, really simple, because, I, I was, I gotta be honest with you, at that point, there was really only one place that people sold to, analog Haven. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And then a little bit after that, Andrea Schneider, over at Schneiders Borough. So one place in Europe, one place, one place in North America. And so I would actually talk to those guys more Sean than Andreas, but even Andreas, they would just tell me stuff that they thought they could sell or that they needed. Because at that time, we kind of felt like Dieter Doper had made the modular system <laugh>, and all we were doing was just kind of supplementing it with the things that Dieter either didn't wanna make or maybe didn't have time to make. So, you know, the first stuff that I did was really simple <span style="color:red" data-ts="1662.665" data-end_ts="1662.885" title="1662.665" id=c_"1662.665">__is__</span>, like the format Jumbler, which was just something that Sean asked me to make, because he said, I've got these guys that have SAGE systems and they want to use their <span style="color:red" data-ts="1671.045" data-end_ts="1671.165" title="1671.045" id=c_"1671.045">__D__</span> system with their Share Sage system. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>So it really just, just changed cables. So you could use banana jacks with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1678.485" data-end_ts="1678.605" title="1678.485" id=c_"1678.485">__a__</span>, with a, UVAC system, and vice versa. The <span style="color:red" data-ts="1682.285" data-end_ts="1682.565" title="1682.285" id=c_"1682.285">__quad__</span> Multim <span style="color:red" data-ts="1683.085" data-end_ts="1683.165" title="1683.085" id=c_"1683.085">__mo__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1683.165" data-end_ts="1683.405" title="1683.165" id=c_"1683.165">__gate__</span>, a low Passade thing was an exciting one for me just because that was something I actually wanted to make. And then, you know, Sean said, Hey, you know, the doer low Passade doesn't have that <inaudible> sound. It's good. Doesn't really have that, that sound. And, so that'd be really, you know, it'd be really cool if you did something that had more of that <inaudible> sound that's, I think people would be interested in that. So I started working on that, and it wasn't really, I didn't want <span style="color:red" data-ts="1706.485" data-end_ts="1706.565" title="1706.485" id=c_"1706.485">__to__</span> just clone it, you know, I didn't want, didn't wanna just make Don's circuit and Euro <span style="color:red" data-ts="1710.405" data-end_ts="1710.685" title="1710.405" id=c_"1710.405">__apps__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1710.745" data-end_ts="1710.965" title="1710.745" id=c_"1710.745">__so__</span>, Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I spent a bunch of time like, trying different configurations and different feedback paths until I found something that was interesting and made the QMMG.

I just wanted one for my Eurorack system. And, and so for my birthday, I, I bought myself, 20 circuit boards from, general Circuits online, retailer, PCB cart, and probably a lot of your listeners have used and that, yeah, it was a birthday project <span style="color:red" data-ts="1750.025" data-end_ts="1750.245" title="1750.025" id=c_"1750.025">__for__</span> myself. I said for my birthday, I'm, I'm gonna make this little module, and I wanted two of 'em, but you know how it is getting two circuit boards cost the same amount of getting 20. So I got 20 and I sold 18 of them and kept two, and was kind of amazed at how fast the other 18 sold. So that was a pretty, pretty fun birthday present. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1767.295" data-end_ts="1767.645" title="1767.295" id=c_"1767.295">__Right__</span>. Yeah.

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. You kind of bought your, you kind of bought your future for your, for your birthday present, which is interesting 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Kind of. Yeah, yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1779.475" data-end_ts="1779.765" title="1779.475" id=c_"1779.475">__Kind__</span> in a, in a very strange way. That's that's exactly what happened. Yeah. Completely. You know, there was no designs on that, man. There was never a business plan. I mean, we're, we're the closest having a business plan today that we've ever been, and we still don't really have one. We're trying to make one. Business plans are hard. It take a lot of time, and then the whole time you're making, doing the business instead of trying to come up with a plan for the business <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So I'm curious about a couple of other things about the start. First of all, why Eurorack? Was it an the influence of Sean or was it that it was the thing that seemed like the most complete system? Or is it just something that spoke to you size and interface wise? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Well, you know, for a minute it was <span style="color:red" data-ts="1822.005" data-end_ts="1822.205" title="1822.005" id=c_"1822.005">__your__</span> rack or frack. I actually have both. I still have some small remnants of my frack system. Yeah. No, and it's funny if we can <span style="color:red" data-ts="1830.125" data-end_ts="1830.285" title="1830.125" id=c_"1830.125">__back__</span> on that. It was, it was like, okay, wait, do, should we make this frack too? Or should I make it only in frack? I mean, this was something that people actually thought about. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1837.645" data-end_ts="1837.845" title="1837.645" id=c_"1837.645">__two__</span> years ago, <laugh>. I, I think for me, the, the, the thing that really moved me to try and, and, make some more modules besides doper, I did like Doper and I had a lot of doper modules. But it was the Harvest Man, who has changed his company's name recently to Industrial Music Electronics. But he had made what I thought was just the coolest module, because for years I had used, I can't remember what they was, it was like a plugin environment that was kind of modular, where you could kind of tie things together with little wires and could load BST plugins and stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>But there was a plugin in this plugin environment called the Decimators Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, he had made a, a hardware decimate, an algorithm. And I just thought, I thought it looked really cool, and, I really wanted one, and I got one and I just, I just loved it. And I thought, this is what I want my company to be like this. I wanna do something that's a little bit on the fringe of what <span style="color:red" data-ts="1898.065" data-end_ts="1898.285" title="1898.065" id=c_"1898.065">__Di__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1898.375" data-end_ts="1898.725" title="1898.375" id=c_"1898.375">__Doper__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1898.725" data-end_ts="1898.805" title="1898.725" id=c_"1898.725">__is__</span> doing, which is admittedly already kind of on the fringe, right. But I wanted to sort of supplement the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1904.905" data-end_ts="1905.125" title="1904.905" id=c_"1904.905">__DOR__</span> system with some really weird, strange ideas, and Stop was already kind of doing that. And so that sort of offered me a glimpse at, at how that could be done, you know, stranger Graphics colors, for example. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, I was gonna ask about that, because Doer is about as plain Jane as it comes, and then all of a sudden, I remember the first time I saw the format Jumbler, I'm like, what? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b><laugh> <laugh>. Yeah, exactly. It was just like, Hey, let you know if, if we're gonna do it, let's do it in kind of an interesting way. Yeah. And Scott was doing that. The algorithm had, it was orange and black. Right. You <span style="color:red" data-ts="1942.405" data-end_ts="1942.445" title="1942.405" id=c_"1942.405">__know__</span>, there was no color in <span style="color:red" data-ts="1943.605" data-end_ts="1943.685" title="1943.605" id=c_"1943.605">__the__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1943.685" data-end_ts="1943.885" title="1943.685" id=c_"1943.685">__DOR__</span> system. So when you saw that algorithm next to, next to your dope, I mean, it was a stark contrast, and I think that really inspired me. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1951.035" data-end_ts="1951.325" title="1951.035" id=c_"1951.035">__Yeah__</span>. It's like, yeah, this is really cool. This looks cool in the system. And then the other company was Plan B Peter Grenada's Company. I really liked his aesthetics as well. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, I had gotten his model 15 <span style="color:red" data-ts="1964.485" data-end_ts="1964.885" title="1964.485" id=c_"1964.485">__BCO__</span>, which I really liked.

</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>So that was very exciting <span style="color:red" data-ts="1976.745" data-end_ts="1976.965" title="1976.745" id=c_"1976.745">__too__</span>. And then, you know, also there was, there was Live Wire who, while they didn't have a lot of color, he did have a, a pretty neat aesthetic, you know, the kind of, old laboratory gear aesthetic that he had going on there, those <span style="color:red" data-ts="1991.205" data-end_ts="1991.405" title="1991.205" id=c_"1991.205">__module__</span> too. So yeah, I think those seen those really, honestly, it was the Harvest Man, but also, I mean, I guess I gotta give credit to Plan B and, and Vibewire too, because just seeing those, those companies making stuff to supplement the DOPA system, because that's what we thought we were doing. We didn't, none of us set out to make a whole line until much later. It was at that time like, well, what hasn't <span style="color:red" data-ts="2011.495" data-end_ts="2011.845" title="2011.495" id=c_"2011.495">__deter__</span> done yet? We should do that.

Okay. So it wasn't until <laugh> things started taking off that we really thought we'd make all the other stuff. You know? I mean, we make a malt here Now. I never thought we'd make a malt Dieter already made a malt, right? <span style="color:red" data-ts="2032.125" data-end_ts="2032.325" title="2032.125" id=c_"2032.125">__But__</span> then people were like, well, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2033.085" data-end_ts="2033.205" title="2033.085" id=c_"2033.085">__want__</span> a malt.

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, now, but it's interesting to kind of think about your planet, sort of like aligning, but in opposition to the, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2047.725" data-end_ts="2047.925" title="2047.725" id=c_"2047.725">__depth__</span> stuff, because that actually does then, both for you and for the Harvestman and, and some of these other things where the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2055.055" data-end_ts="2055.405" title="2055.055" id=c_"2055.055">__defer__</span> stuff is really clean, both in looks and in sound. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> a lot of you who started started these early modular companies had a tendency to make, make messy things. Right. The QMG was messy. The, the stuff that the Harvest Man was making was messy stuff. Right. And, I, I'd never really thought of that as being sort of like how you fill in the blanks of the system, but it makes perfect sense in that environment. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Yeah. Yeah. No, that's, that's a, that's that think you, I think you hit the nail on the head there. Yeah. Yeah. Why make another, you know? Yeah. We, we don't need an analog VCO, we need, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2094.565" data-end_ts="2094.685" title="2094.565" id=c_"2094.565">__a__</span> algorithm to make that analog VCO sound really completely sonically decimated.

</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So now a, a lot of your designs seem to be ULA influenced without being <span style="color:red" data-ts="2110.425" data-end_ts="2110.845" title="2110.425" id=c_"2110.425">__buchla__</span> clownish, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So, you know, you've got, well, the waggle bug you worked with, with Grant, I assume, to bring that home. Absolutely. And, the, you know, your DPO has got some of the sort of like, complexity, but it's expressed in a different way. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, your filters, your envelopes, your, your VCAs, you know, you have this strike thing always on your modules, which sort of really implies this ULA orientation, but it's not unlike some other people who have taken that. You're not trying to in any way clone it. You're, you're bringing your own take on it. Mm-Hmm. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2150.285" data-end_ts="2150.365" title="2150.285" id=c_"2150.285">__And__</span> I'm wondering, Mm-Hmm, <affirmative>, what was the influence that made the, that ula sensibility work for you? Why, where did you get that from? But at the same time, what makes you need to do your own variations on it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Well, I, I think, working at Moog, with Moog Instruments all day long, long, when we'd come home from work, I think a lot of times we'd, be looking for something else, <laugh> and, I, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2183.445" data-end_ts="2183.665" title="2183.445" id=c_"2183.445">__not__</span>, not because the mug wasn't great, the mug was great. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>I hear you. The Voyager instrument. Yeah. It, it's <laugh>. I think, you know, there was a couple things. I think for one, I, I think there was some music made on the booklet. It really spoke to me just in, in the way that it was so freeform and, and so different than anything else that I had had ever heard. And, and, and then also there was the thing of like trying to, you know, the, the booklet system wasn't so documented, . Especially pre-internet times where you're, you're sort of looking through books at the library on electronic music for any mention of, of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2221.755" data-end_ts="2222.105" title="2221.755" id=c_"2221.755">__Boola__</span>, just to try and learn a little bit more about it. Right. So there was a certain mystery about the instrument and a certain, intrigue because of that. It was just so different than anything else that, that I'd ever, come across. And, I, I mean, I would just, I would literally just, I had pictures saved on my hard drive that I'd find on the internet of, of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2245.585" data-end_ts="2245.905" title="2245.585" id=c_"2245.585">__Google__</span> systems that I would just stare at. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Did you ever get <span style="color:red" data-ts="2249.625" data-end_ts="2249.865" title="2249.625" id=c_"2249.625">__hand__</span>, did you ever get hands on time with them? Or was it just looking at the pictures and imagine imagining what they did? 
</p>

<p>

There was no system for us to play. I mean, it was just more like, I would just stare at these pictures. And there was a couple of other guys who worked at Moog that would sometimes, get into talking to me about it. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, one of the guys, Aaron, that used to work on <span style="color:red" data-ts="2279.915" data-end_ts="2280.035" title="2279.915" id=c_"2279.915">__the__</span>, a little fatty line would also, we'd talk about the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2283.035" data-end_ts="2283.195" title="2283.035" id=c_"2283.035">__vocal__</span> system a lot, and, we'd just stare at pictures of it. Yeah. Like, yeah, I would just, I would try to imagine like, what is this, you know, what is this knob doing? And, and, and I would think about some of the records that I knew Google system was used on, and try to think about how these pictures of the modules corresponded with, with that record and how they were using them to make those sounds. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>It wasn't until quite a few years later, I was at a event in Chicago, one of the really early, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2311.075" data-end_ts="2311.355" title="2311.075" id=c_"2311.075">__sent__</span> events are pretty common these days, but at that time you had analog, analog heaven with <span style="color:red" data-ts="2316.205" data-end_ts="2316.365" title="2316.205" id=c_"2316.205">__do__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2316.365" data-end_ts="2316.605" title="2316.365" id=c_"2316.365">__events__</span>. And then, the trash audio crew <span style="color:red" data-ts="2319.485" data-end_ts="2319.805" title="2319.485" id=c_"2319.485">__<inaudible>__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2319.805" data-end_ts="2320.125" title="2319.805" id=c_"2319.805">__would__</span> put on events in, Chicago. And there was a guy who had a <inaudible> system in Chicago, and I got snowed in after that event. And he said, Hey, man, you're, you know, as long as you're snowed in, you wanna borrow this uc <span style="color:red" data-ts="2329.245" data-end_ts="2329.325" title="2329.245" id=c_"2329.245">__glucose__</span> system for a few days while you're stuck here. And so I said, hell yeah, <laugh>. I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2335.965" data-end_ts="2336.085" title="2335.965" id=c_"2335.965">__would__</span> say this really nice guy, Rob. He, he loaned me this system and, and I just gotta to play with it for a while. That was the first time I really, that was the first time I got to use the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2343.885" data-end_ts="2344.045" title="2343.885" id=c_"2343.885">__<inaudible>__</span> system. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>It was a 200 E so it wasn't the vintage, you know, it wasn't the original 200 series modules that I had spent all this time staring at photos of, but the spirit was still there. So yeah, I think it was just being completely intrigued by it and just wanting to know how those things worked because I, I couldn't get my hands on 'em. And so that led to like breadboarding a lot of the circuits too. There was a few people who had somehow, had complete collections of schematics, which I'm now informed by Mark Barbo that most of those schematics are wrong or contain grave errors, <laugh>. Right, right. But, you know, it was enough to cobble together stuff on a breadboard to see, kind of probe around and, and, and see how they worked. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2383.985" data-end_ts="2384.205" title="2383.985" id=c_"2383.985">__Now__</span>, one thing I do a lot is I, I'll build a circuit on a breadboard and then take my scope probe and just, just look at all the different points in the circuit and see what it's doing in different points. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>To me, that's like, that's just a good way to learn how an electrical circuit works. So, yeah, so I do a lot of that too, just probing those circuits and just seeing like what's, you know, why does he, why does he have this cap here when he already has this resistor here? What's he trying to do with this? And, and trying to figure out what he was trying to do. I think by that time, I'd much <span style="color:red" data-ts="2413.205" data-end_ts="2413.405" title="2413.205" id=c_"2413.205">__been__</span> studying, I, I didn't have any interest in just like, recreating it. Yeah. I kind of wanted to take it and expand on it, I guess. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and it's funny because if you want something that's inspirational, some of those <inaudible> front panels are that because the naming conventions are all over the map, you know, and so you could, you could apply a lot of imagination to what you saw in the pictures. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Man. Yeah. Oh, for sure. Like, you look at a picture of, of the original 200 series, source of uncertainty. Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2444.425" data-end_ts="2444.645" title="2444.425" id=c_"2444.425">__And__</span>, and I mean, that would just set my mind reeling man. I mean, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2448.605" data-end_ts="2448.845" title="2448.605" id=c_"2448.605">__just__</span>, just the name alone, source of uncertainty, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2451.825" data-end_ts="2452.045" title="2451.825" id=c_"2451.825">__and__</span>, and then the little drawings and, and the hiogly that are on there. And Oh, man. I mean, it would just, it really made me, made me wanna make music. So <span style="color:red" data-ts="2461.475" data-end_ts="2461.765" title="2461.475" id=c_"2461.475">__yeah__</span>. To try to capture that feeling in my heart and try to fill some of that <span style="color:red" data-ts="2466.425" data-end_ts="2466.645" title="2466.425" id=c_"2466.425">__in__</span> what we do here. 'cause while people probably wouldn't go down on record saying that, that make noise are the most accurate or precise set of modules out there, the people who do like, make noise, I think would be glad to go down on record saying that they, they find, some good inspiration in them. And that's enough for me. That's, that's what makes me happy to hear. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Sure. Now, when you talk about having listened to records that you knew Ula, synthesizers on, what were some of those artists and records that were influential? Because on, on one hand, like looking at 'em and imagining the synthesis is one angle of it, but you also, I would say that your, your modules are very instrument, very instrumental. They're very much, they're clearly musical devices, right. Even ones that have very utility purposes. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, they seem very Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> musical in nature. And so I, I'm curious, what are the kind, what are the artistic, what, what, who are the artists that kind of informed you about that? So like that put the sound in your head? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Well, the first one was probably the first one for a lot of people. Morton. Saba. Right. I came across, at a library record cell, you know, when libraries are kind of ditching their records to get into cassettes or CDs. And I found a, a pretty nice copy of Silver Apples <span style="color:red" data-ts="2550.485" data-end_ts="2550.645" title="2550.485" id=c_"2550.485">__of__</span> the Moon. Right. Also found some strange, music punk CRA records <span style="color:red" data-ts="2554.715" data-end_ts="2555.005" title="2554.715" id=c_"2554.715">__same__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2555.005" data-end_ts="2555.205" title="2555.005" id=c_"2555.005">__day__</span>, well, you know, 50 cents or something like that. And, but that was when I was quite young. And, and at that point <span style="color:red" data-ts="2559.645" data-end_ts="2559.885" title="2559.645" id=c_"2559.645">__there__</span>, the internet wasn't really something that was available to the common person. They were probably using it in <span style="color:red" data-ts="2564.945" data-end_ts="2565.165" title="2564.945" id=c_"2564.945">__the__</span>, in the military or on college campuses or something, but that would've been like 1988 or something like that. So, okay. There wasn't really <span style="color:red" data-ts="2571.765" data-end_ts="2571.885" title="2571.765" id=c_"2571.765">__a__</span>, a way to learn much more about it. Now fast forward many years and having spent a lot of time looking for mentions of, ULA or even Morton Nik and library books and whatnot, oddly enough, I was able to find quite a bit about music re in some libraries that, that were, available to me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Which I thought I've always thought was kind of odd that somehow <span style="color:red" data-ts="2592.415" data-end_ts="2592.765" title="2592.415" id=c_"2592.415">__Lukla__</span> and Morton Nik eluded me, but music, Rett Pier <span style="color:red" data-ts="2595.645" data-end_ts="2596.045" title="2595.645" id=c_"2595.645">__Shafer__</span> and, and all that was somehow like very, was everywhere well documented <laugh>. Right. I just got lucky and found a couple of really good books on tape music. But fast forward a little bit and, and, I actually had a great email conversation with Peter Grenada once where he recommended, this is really early on, while I was, working at Mode, he had recommended some records to me, and one of them was a record <span style="color:red" data-ts="2619.275" data-end_ts="2619.565" title="2619.275" id=c_"2619.275">__Lost__</span> Atlantis by, Barry Schrader. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And that record just blew my mind. I mean, it was just, the fact that it had been made on this <span style="color:red" data-ts="2629.625" data-end_ts="2629.845" title="2629.625" id=c_"2629.625">__BCA__</span> 200 system was, had already had me intrigued, but just the sound quality of it and how it was composed, the use of, of both negative and positive space, the tams that he achieved, I, I mean, it was hard to believe, for me, it was hard to believe that <span style="color:red" data-ts="2645.095" data-end_ts="2645.135" title="2645.095" id=c_"2645.095">__it__</span> was a record that was made back in the seventies. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>And it really made me believe also that the, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2650.775" data-end_ts="2650.975" title="2650.775" id=c_"2650.775">__CLE__</span> 200 series instrument was, more powerful than I had imagined. Right. That was a big one. That, that very Schrader record was a big one. Of course, the Terry Riley Harrison, some of the Terry Riley stuff. And then, once you start digging, you can start getting into, you know, now there's a lot of really cool books out there that will talk about people like Pauline Ros and, Raymond Sender. And it, it just kind of opens up to you nowadays because there's resources where you can go and you can find these people and you can go and you can find their records and you can get them pretty quickly. Yeah. It kind of goes back to this original email computer Grenada, though, recommending that <span style="color:red" data-ts="2689.965" data-end_ts="2690.165" title="2689.965" id=c_"2689.965">__very__</span> Shrader record that really set me off when I heard that record. That's interesting. Have you heard that one,

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Like, one time I was over at Grant Richter's house and he played it, and he's like, oh, you gotta check this out. And I was like, yeah, it's amazing <laugh>. But, and then I've never ran across it again, and it's quite a rarity. I think

<b>Tony: </b>He's, he's, he's a special character man. He, that he is, he's a cool guy because he's really, he's, he's like the guy that held the torch for so many years between, you know, when Don stopped making modular and was making MIDI controllers. And, and then, and then Dieter started making, you know, modules and stuff. You know, he had this guy, grant Richter, who somehow taken great interest in the stuff that apparently no one else in the whole world gave a damn about for about 15 years. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>He gave me a hell of an education just by being able to set me in front of a system a, a model 200 and saying, here, check out this, check out that it was such a, it was such a mind altering experience to do that. So it, that's, yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>I bet, man. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2767.205" data-end_ts="2767.325" title="2767.205" id=c_"2767.205">__I__</span> bet. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Let's talk a little bit now about, about some of the stuff you've done. First of all, it's interesting that given where you started, it's, it's been only kind of recently that you've even put together enough modules where you could make a full system. So the shared system, you started producing those, what, like a couple years ago, right? A little bit after the DPO became available? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Yeah, no, that's, it's, you know, it's, it's funny, it's, it's doesn't seem like long ago, but I think that's actually about five, six years ago. Jesus <laugh> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2800.145" data-end_ts="2800.365" title="2800.145" id=c_"2800.145">__now__</span>, five years ago. Wow. Maybe five years ago. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that just tells you how time is flying for me, but there you go. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>It's for me too. I mean, I'm always getting myself into this kind of travel where I think something just happened, but it actually happened a while ago. The <span style="color:red" data-ts="2814.645" data-end_ts="2814.965" title="2814.645" id=c_"2814.645">__Longine__</span> came out in 2010, so that would've been when we made the first shared systems, would've been 2010. Unbelievable. But I mean, you gotta understand it was, they were far and few between because, you know, getting the quantity of modules and the cases altogether, so you, you're talking about maybe in 2010, we maybe made like three, you know, <laugh>. Right. And one of 'em was the one we sent out to people to make the records with, to 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Make the records. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Probably, I guess 2011 would maybe be more of a more realistic, I guess. Sure. Because, you know, really the first systems weren't something we really offered as a product. It was more like some musicians wanted a system, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2850.605" data-end_ts="2850.725" title="2850.605" id=c_"2850.605">__I__</span> came up with that configuration and then we decided to make the records for it. And then after we make the records, then we started actually offering them just on the website or whatever. So I guess maybe 2011, I'm guessing this is a great que Kelly would know the answer to this question. She has a great memory for that kind of stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I think it's really interesting though, that you came up with that primarily as sort of like a vehicle to put together this, what I would call an art project of dev, of taking this one system and sending it to people and saying, Hey, can you make a record using this? I think that's, that's pretty interesting. First of all, it's probably something that your newfound manufacturing experts would say, Hmm, this doesn't make sense. <laugh>, you know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But, right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But it also though, it really speaks to, again, sort of the fact that you're developing, you've got a vision and it's a musical vision, and having that done was really, it. It seems like a natural part of that vision. Did you do it on a lark, or was it actually something you had always hoped to do? Or was it something that people said, Hey, why don't we do this? How, how did you get into actually producing music? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Well, <inaudible>, a good friend of mine and I were in New York City and we were outside of, this bar. It was actually a cool place. You could see some cool shows there. It's closed now, but we were just talking about stuff we could do that would be fun. And, we had talked about making records and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2949.365" data-end_ts="2949.805" title="2949.365" id=c_"2949.365">__because__</span> he's search, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2950.765" data-end_ts="2950.885" title="2950.765" id=c_"2950.765">__I__</span> loves records, and I said, yeah, man, making records would be kind of cool, but, but we can't, we should make something, you know, we should make, make some sort of a framework around it. And he and I just gotta talking. And he and I got this idea to ask five friends to make a record all using the same instrument. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I said, yeah, like, you know, they would share the system. And then we came up with the idea like, you <span style="color:red" data-ts="2975.885" data-end_ts="2975.965" title="2975.885" id=c_"2975.885">__know__</span>, we'll call the shared system series and, and send this same system. And at that point we didn't have five different copies of that system. We just had the one, like I said, and we didn't <laugh>, so that's why it took so long to make the records. Like, we, when we shipped <span style="color:red" data-ts="2989.385" data-end_ts="2989.605" title="2989.385" id=c_"2989.385">__the__</span> Keith Bulletin Whitman, he had it for quite a while. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2991.525" data-end_ts="2991.725" title="2991.525" id=c_"2991.525">__So__</span> I think he had, he had left the country for Australia or something. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2994.585" data-end_ts="2994.805" title="2994.585" id=c_"2994.585">__It__</span> was just sitting in <span style="color:red" data-ts="2995.725" data-end_ts="2995.845" title="2995.725" id=c_"2995.725">__each__</span> bedroom for like four months or something. Oh 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>My, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Okay. But yeah, I mean, we, the idea was just sort of, it sort of came about that night in New York City hanging out with <span style="color:red" data-ts="3004.685" data-end_ts="3004.925" title="3004.685" id=c_"3004.685">__searcher__</span>, talking about how could we make records, but how could we do it in a way that maybe be a little more interesting? And, and you're right, it was kind of an arc project. It was this idea, you know, well, here's a, here's a theory. Let's, let's see if we can use the process of making records to prove it. And the theory was that if you create an instrument that's open-ended enough, the artist's voice could shine through the instrument. And because there's this sort of thing that's happening with electronic music where people, they want it to happen automatically, almost. And, and it's almost like the software and hardware, designers have as much control over electronic music as the musicians themselves. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>And the hope was that you would get five really unique records. And there was some concern, like there was part of me that thought, well, what if we get five records and they all kind of sound the same <laugh>, that would be a great disappointment, <laugh>. But, you know, you <span style="color:red" data-ts="3053.845" data-end_ts="3054.045" title="3053.845" id=c_"3053.845">__gotta__</span> accept the outcome. But no, I think we did get five really unique records, and especially considering that most of these people didn't have the system for that long, they had to sort of just apply their general knowledge of, of synthesis to the system. Sure. In order to create something. Especially, I think Alessandro didn't really have much time at all for his piece. He was scheduled to leave out on tour for a while, and he really just had this short period of time to develop his pieces. So some of them had very little time and, and still I think produced something pretty memorable. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Indeed. It's, it's a incredible body of work. I think it's, it's something that, you know, if, if you think about the fact that we still, you know, listen to the <span style="color:red" data-ts="3098.575" data-end_ts="3098.925" title="3098.575" id=c_"3098.575">__Subic__</span> records as like elemental things to listen to and to get inspired by, I think that you build something that kind of has, has that feel to it as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>I think for the <span style="color:red" data-ts="3109.925" data-end_ts="3110.125" title="3109.925" id=c_"3109.925">__artists__</span> too, I think some of them like to go back and listen to it. I know I was talking to Richard Dev Divine last week and his record came up and he said he, what did he say? I think he did like 27 hours of recording before he got the one he wanted or something. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. He came across some, some like other variation that he had almost chosen, as his final cut was listening to it and just really enjoyed it, kind of going back and listening to that. And he was thinking, he was like, I was just thinking about, I, I used to have these like techniques that I was doing when I was making that, that record. And so now I'm trying to remember what those techniques were so I can kind of dig them out and, and start using them again. So yeah, it was, I think it was fun. A fun challenge for the artist too. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Now, the shared system is a very, is a fairly large and complete system with a lot of functionality. Recently, you've kind of gone the opposite way with, with your new Zero <span style="color:red" data-ts="3160.975" data-end_ts="3161.325" title="3160.975" id=c_"3160.975">__coast__</span>, product. Can you explain a little bit about what your thinking was behind that and how you chose to, include the functions that you did on it? Because it's, it, it breaks some conventions for make noise. Right. And so I'm curious about, a little bit about your thought process going into that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Well, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3183.525" data-end_ts="3183.645" title="3183.525" id=c_"3183.525">__I__</span>, I mean, it, it's funny because so many people will say something along the lines of, I know it's called No Coast or Zero Coast, but it's really kind of more West Coast. And I think they're kind of, they're, they're missing one really big point, which is the form factor <span style="color:red" data-ts="3197.105" data-end_ts="3197.325" title="3197.105" id=c_"3197.105">__in__</span> which has been delivered is, is actually quite, east Coast. You could say, you know, something that's sort of ready to go, ready to use a committee. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I was gonna say keyboard oriented, which is very, very East coast. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Yeah, exactly. And I think, you know, people so often they think of East Coast, they think of transistor ladder, lowpass, you know, 2040 <span style="color:red" data-ts="3215.605" data-end_ts="3215.725" title="3215.605" id=c_"3215.605">__B__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3215.725" data-end_ts="3215.925" title="3215.725" id=c_"3215.725">__per__</span> Lowpass filter. And you know, obviously that's a big part of the Moog sound. But the functionality of the Moog, I think has as much to do with the music that was created with it as the, sound of <span style="color:red" data-ts="3227.565" data-end_ts="3227.685" title="3227.565" id=c_"3227.565">__a__</span> filter. For example, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3228.785" data-end_ts="3229.005" title="3228.785" id=c_"3228.785">__the__</span>, the use of the, four stage A DSR envelope as opposed to, something like, you know, the, the two stage envelopes that were so common in the West Coast instruments from Serge and <span style="color:red" data-ts="3238.755" data-end_ts="3239.045" title="3238.755" id=c_"3238.755">__Bula__</span> right there. I mean, playing a modular synthesizer with an organ style keyboard with, with black and white keys, with the A DSR allows you a lot more functionality than playing a ULA instrument, for example, with an organ style keyboard, having only the two stage envelopes, it just gives you so much more functionality. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>And it also kind of sounds a little bit more like the classic organ sounds because the classic organ sounds had that, that really, sharp, noisy attack percussion, I think they would oftentimes call it followed by <span style="color:red" data-ts="3271.605" data-end_ts="3271.885" title="3271.605" id=c_"3271.605">__access__</span> and a release. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And so that the Zero <span style="color:red" data-ts="3274.965" data-end_ts="3275.165" title="3274.965" id=c_"3274.965">__code__</span> has that. And I think really for me, I just wanted to kind of take the two worlds that I've been inhabiting. You know, having worked at Moog for a while and spent so much time studying the work of, of both Bob Moog and then Don Ula, I kind of wanted to see how the two of them could come together to make an instrument. And I didn't want to sound anything like a Moog and I didn't really want it to sound much like a <span style="color:red" data-ts="3297.765" data-end_ts="3297.965" title="3297.765" id=c_"3297.765">__ula__</span>, which is a little bit easier to do because most people haven't actually used a <span style="color:red" data-ts="3301.565" data-end_ts="3301.725" title="3301.565" id=c_"3301.565">__ULA__</span> instrument. <laugh>, they think they know what it sounds like, but they, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3305.565" data-end_ts="3305.805" title="3305.565" id=c_"3305.565">__they__</span>, they don't actually. And, and for what it's worth <span style="color:red" data-ts="3308.405" data-end_ts="3308.605" title="3308.405" id=c_"3308.405">__it__</span>, the Zero post obviously sounds less like a <span style="color:red" data-ts="3311.505" data-end_ts="3311.725" title="3311.505" id=c_"3311.505">__MO__</span> than it does at ula, but it really doesn't sound like Abu <laugh>. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. I haven't had a chance to actually have my hands on one, but, a friend of mine sent me some recordings that, that he did, and it was, it really did have unique sound. I mean it for me. This person had also done some stuff using like older corg analog stuff. Mm-Hmm. And it really had that mm-Hmm. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3335.045" data-end_ts="3335.085" title="3335.045" id=c_"3335.045">__<affirmative>__</span> kind of flavor to it, which I thought was really interesting. Interesting. And so, yeah. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>That is 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. But, you know, I wonder it could just as easily be the fact that he's done it that way before with cogs and that's how he naturally approaches instrument. I think I like that whenever I find, I find interest instrument builders who, the way that they create the instrument invites people to bring their own voice to the table. I always find that really fascinating. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Yeah. That, yeah. And, and important really, I mean, it's kind of an important part of a design. If, if a design only allows for a limited range of use, then it's, in my opinion, it's not the greatest design. You know, you look at someone like Alessandro Cortini worked on <span style="color:red" data-ts="3374.805" data-end_ts="3374.965" title="3374.805" id=c_"3374.805">__the__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3375.085" data-end_ts="3375.325" title="3375.085" id=c_"3375.085">__<inaudible>__</span> system are quite different than the works of Barry Strader. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3379.205" data-end_ts="3379.485" title="3379.205" id=c_"3379.205">__Were__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3379.485" data-end_ts="3379.725" title="3379.485" id=c_"3379.485">__were__</span> Martin ot. Right. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="3381.325" data-end_ts="3381.525" title="3381.325" id=c_"3381.325">__they__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3381.525" data-end_ts="3381.725" title="3381.525" id=c_"3381.525">__did__</span>, they're night and day, but they were created on a, the same instrument, which is a, what most people would considered a, a very quirky and strange and unique instrument to begin with. So the fact that you could have these artists that, that sound so different using both using that same strange, unique instrument, to me points to a a, a good, a good design. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. So I've already burned through my time. I appreciate you being, you being patient with me <laugh>, but before I let you go, one of the things I would like to ask is what do you think the future looks like? And this could be any of the futures that you're interested in, whether it's the future of make noise or of modular systems or music tech or even music. I'm curious to know how you imagine the future looking. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Yeah, I spend so much time in the present <laugh>. For me, I, I think I look, you know, I, I just got my, my little nephew, one of those ation circuits. It's been interesting seeing how he interacts with that. I feel like kids, you know, like when I was his age, you know, we were using <span style="color:red" data-ts="3453.825" data-end_ts="3454.045" title="3453.825" id=c_"3453.825">__the__</span> microphones built into a boombox to, you know, record hammering on an old beat up acoustic guitars or something like that. I mean, I just feel like the technology that the young, the youngest, musical generation is having access to <span style="color:red" data-ts="3469.385" data-end_ts="3469.605" title="3469.385" id=c_"3469.385">__is__</span>, is so complex right now. And when they actually get to an age where, you know, I realized something like <span style="color:red" data-ts="3476.405" data-end_ts="3476.645" title="3476.405" id=c_"3476.405">__<inaudible>__</span> Circuit, it comes with a lot of presets and, and, and ready to make beats, so to speak. It's literally the antithesis of what we do here at Make Noise. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>But the reason I got it for him is that I kind of wanted him to be satisfied. You know, he said, I wanna make beats that while this is what people do to make beats these days. Right. And my hope is that by the time he gets to be a little older, he will kind of grown out of that and <span style="color:red" data-ts="3499.485" data-end_ts="3499.685" title="3499.485" id=c_"3499.485">__he__</span> be looking to explore more deeply electronic music. And, and having already done, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3505.245" data-end_ts="3505.365" title="3505.245" id=c_"3505.245">__I__</span> already worked with an instrument that's, that is, very, focused on a sort of prefabricated type of music. I felt like if he could get that out the way at a young age, by the time he gets to be in his twenties, he's gonna be ready to break some new ground. Sure. I feel like a lot of young people have that potential as they're starting with iPhone apps and, and, and little hardware instruments that are so complex already. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3527.905" data-end_ts="3528.125" title="3527.905" id=c_"3527.905">__If__</span> by the time they grow out of those, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3530.405" data-end_ts="3530.525" title="3530.405" id=c_"3530.405">__I__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3530.525" data-end_ts="3530.645" title="3530.525" id=c_"3530.525">__mean__</span>, I imagine that they're going to need electronic music systems of complexity that we don't really even understand right now. Look at even like Max MSP for example, I mean, the number of people using maths now that it's been incorporated, and I understand it's not full, it's not like using Max MSP, but <span style="color:red" data-ts="3546.865" data-end_ts="3547.085" title="3546.865" id=c_"3546.865">__Max__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3547.155" data-end_ts="3547.445" title="3547.155" id=c_"3547.155">__four__</span> live in Appleton Live.

</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's true. Very true. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>I, I feel like in just a short period of time, I, I'm going to to be a dinosaur. I I'm gonna be completely outmoded when these kids get to that age. You know, right now if someone looks at the make noise system and they think something like the Tempe or the Maps or whatever it is that they're looking at is so complex. But I guess I just wonder, I feel like in 10, 15 years, that's gonna be the equivalent of a, of a basic electronic instrument. The acoustic guitar of electronic music. Right. Everyone will learn it because that's where you start. But they're gonna be looking for something even more complex. And I honestly don't know what that is. And that's probably the scariest thing about owning <span style="color:red" data-ts="3594.405" data-end_ts="3594.525" title="3594.405" id=c_"3594.405">__a__</span> business, like make noise and having people who come in <span style="color:red" data-ts="3597.125" data-end_ts="3597.205" title="3597.125" id=c_"3597.125">__and__</span> work every day and <span style="color:red" data-ts="3598.415" data-end_ts="3598.765" title="3598.415" id=c_"3598.415">__wanna__</span> get their checks cashed at the end of the week.

<b>Tony: </b>My job is to kind of figure out what that future is so we can keep on keeping on. But right now, when I look into it, I don't, I don't have the idea. The only idea that, the only thing I know is that it's, it's gonna be a lot more complex than than we, than we could ever imagine.

So that stuff's no longer mysterious. Right. It's no longer mysterious. It, it doesn't, it, everyone can get their hands on it either in hardware or in software versions. Everyone knows how to program a 9 0 9 now by the time they're 18 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Yeah. That's become the new baseline. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>E Exactly. So if that's our baseline, if what was at one point for me, if that's our baseline now and a few more years, the, the, the paradigm of, of modular synthesis, you know, what was once a mystery to me when I was staring at those pictures of, of the, the, the 2 59 and, and, you know, the, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3662.005" data-end_ts="3662.205" title="3662.005" id=c_"3662.005">__the__</span>, the whole ULA 200 system, potentially that could become the baseline next. And, and that will be, everyone will just work towards having a knowledge of two stage function generators versus four stage function generators and frequency modulation, versus wave folding and so on and so forth. Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3680.845" data-end_ts="3680.965" title="3680.845" id=c_"3680.845">__I__</span> think it's, I don't know, it's entirely possible. And then where from there, I mean, that's not something that we know right now. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>True 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Enough. I don't think. Well, if you know it, man, let's talk about it afterwards. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, yeah. Well, Tony, I want to thank you so much for your time. It's been fantastic talk and fantastic to hear about how you got got here, but also to really get a sense and a feel for your continued excitement with doing this stuff. I really appreciate you taking the time. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Yeah, no, I appreciate talking to you as well, darling. It was a good conversation 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Indeed. Well, thank you so much, and we'll talk again soon. All 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Right. All <span style="color:red" data-ts="3714.085" data-end_ts="3714.125" title="3714.085" id=c_"3714.085">__right__</span>. Take it easy. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nobody: </b><i>Bye. </i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Many thanks to Tony for getting together and having the chat. It's really interesting to hear about his background and the kinds of things that he's done over the years and the way that he's got a vision for the future as well. It's really pretty exciting. I wanna thank you to listeners for dropping in, checking it out. Hope that you enjoyed this as well as all of the previous ones. Go check the archive. There's plenty of good stuff there.
