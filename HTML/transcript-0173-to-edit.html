<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today I am very pleased to talk to somebody who kind of is one of my heroes. He's been around the scene for as long as I've been paying attention to the scene, the scene being music and technology and synthesizers and all that good stuff. His name's Jim Akin, and, I just want to start off by saying hi to Jim. Hey, Jim. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim Aikin: </b>I'm doing great, Darwin. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm great. Thanks a lot for joining us for this podcast. I really appreciate it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>Hey, it's a pleasure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So why don't we kick off for those people who might not be, immediately familiar with their name. Why don't we give, the listeners, a quick overview of who you are and what you do and what you're currently up to? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>Okay. Well, a quick overview. I don't know that would be, that'd take an hour or so, <laugh> what, what I have done o over the course of my career is, I started at, keyboard Magazine as an assistant editor in 1975, and I worked there until I was downsized out the door in their third round of layoffs in, 2002. And, because I was sitting at that desk at keyboard, over the course of those years, I was very heavily involved in all kinds of wonderful developments in music technology. You know, starting from, the early days when, you know, even before the Prophet Five was released, Dave Smith and Barb Hurst used to come by, they'd drop by the office and hang out with Tom and Dominic. And so I knew that the prophet was coming down the pike, you know, then the DX seven and, you know, and all the other stuff that happened over the years. And I was just lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time to get involved in that. Prior to that, I had had no background in music technology to speak of, as a, as a rock bass player. In 1970, I had tried, soldering a patch cord for the <span style="color:red" data-ts="135.605" data-end_ts="135.765" title="135.605" id=c_"135.605">__base__</span>, and I decided soldering was not for me. So that was the extent of my involvement in technology until the, until I started at keyboard. That's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Really interesting. So, I mean, were you friends with these people and that's how you got the gig, or did they just, were they so desperate for someone who could write that they opened the door? How do you, how do you get in the door when you can't, when you don't even know the tech? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>That's a good question, and the answer is yes. I was friends with these people. <span style="color:red" data-ts="164.225" data-end_ts="164.445" title="164.225" id=c_"164.225">__Ah__</span>, okay. There's, there's a big history background here, which is that, I, I live in Livermore. I, when I was at the magazine, I was in the South Bay on the peninsula, but I grew up in Livermore and I'm back there these days. Okay. And Tom Darter and I, Tom was the founding editor of Keyboard, were in the same class in high school, and so we were good friends. When Tom and I decided to start a rock band in the late sixties, we were looking around for a drummer, and there was this jazz drummer who ran a local bookstore, and his name was Jim Crockett. And so Tom and I knew Jim from, the days of the bookstore, and then various other things happened, and the bookstore, went belly up. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>Livermore has never been a popular destination for book buyers. And, so Jim Crockett moved down to, Los Gatos and started working for Buddy Eastman at Guitar Player. I actually worked at Guitar Player for six or eight months, and I decided that I wasn't really interested in string gauges and what kind of pick people used. Right. Which there was a lot of that. Right. So I quit guitar player and I went and played in another band. But then in 1975 when, Jim was very successful with guitar player and he decided to start a keyboard magazine, he called on Tom Darter to be the editor. And, Tom picked up one of his, students from Roosevelt University in Chicago, Dominic Milano, to be the first assistant editor. Dominic was 19 at the time, and played accordion. And then they, when they got ready to hire somebody else, I kind of stuck my foot in the door and said, gee, whizz, I think I'd like this job. And that's what happened. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So that was in 1975. What did music technology even look like then, from your, from your eyes? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>From my eyes. Okay. What happened was that Dominic and I were actually roommates briefly before I got my own apartment. And he had a MiniMogue and so, and we, he had no speakers, so you had to futz around with a MiniMogue while wearing headphones. And Tom lived in the same apartment complex just down the walk, and he had an arc 2,600 and which did have speakers. And so my introduction to music technology was, those devices, which at the time were a state <span style="color:red" data-ts="300.005" data-end_ts="300.125" title="300.005" id=c_"300.005">__of__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="300.125" data-end_ts="300.245" title="300.125" id=c_"300.125">__the__</span> art, you know, but I had no background as a keyboard player because I was a, cellist and still am, and a basic guitar player, which I'm not anymore. It was my knowledge of music and my ability to write that attracted, them to the idea that they ought to hire me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, one of the things I like doing in my podcast is I like talking to people about their beginner story, and I'm sure that you have a very interesting one. And so I'd like to step back before Keyboard Magazine and kind of set the table, because one of the things I know from just doing a little study with you, you're, you have kind of tendrils into a lot of different worlds. So you mentioned already that you're a cellist and fairly accomplished one. You've, long had this interaction with music tech, but you're also, if I am, if I am not mistaken, you're also, kind of known as a science fiction, enthusiast and writer. Correct? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>Yeah. That's among my, alleged accomplishments. I, <laugh>. I like to call myself one of the west coast's least active and least well-known science fiction writers. You know, I had a couple of novels published along the way. I'm a member of Science Fiction Writers of America, yada, yada, yada. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But I'm, I'm no longer very active in that area. I've discovered that while I am a natural writer, I'm not a natural storyteller. And so, I, I tend to try to write novels and they tend to, turn into train wrecks on me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>So I've mainly concentrated on the, on the music thing. I've done a few other things along the way. I actually, for a while, I was pretty heavily involved in the text adventure game, development field. I wrote half a dozen, adventure games that were released and are available online for free. That is another of the, technologies that is kind of in a slump or in a permanent slump, <laugh> shrinking, because, you know, computers can now do much more than text. And so, but there are still people who are clinging to that, field. So that was kind of fun. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's interesting you say that because, I recently kind of re my, my son was, is really into gaming, and I introduced him to some of the, some of the zork adventures. Right. And 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>Exactly, that was what inspired me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, I was, I, I found it so exciting when it was, when it was first available, and he kinda looked at me like I was a little crazy <laugh>, but, I liked it Anyway, <laugh>. Yeah. So how did, how did you, I mean, this is a really interesting combination of things, and I'm curious, like, what, growing up in, in Northern California, what was kind of the background that got you to sort of feel free? 'cause one of the things I would say is with somebody who has this many different kind of varied background interests, you must have had an, an interesting time growing up to where you felt free to explore all these different things. What, what did that look like? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>Well, I don't know that I ever felt free growing up. I think that would be a, a, a mischaracterization of my misspent youth. What it was for me, I think, is that from the time I was very young, I placed a high value on, things that I found interesting in an intellectual way. I've been pretty, free to explore because there's lots of stuff to explore, you know, so amateur, hobbyist computer programming interests me, you know, I, as an adult, I have, learned to play the piano, and I play Bach on the piano, Bach and <span style="color:red" data-ts="518.845" data-end_ts="519.245" title="518.845" id=c_"518.845">__Hayden__</span> and, and Clemente, you know, I'm, I'm a bad pianist, but I, I enjoy doing it. Pretty much anything that piques my interest, you know, I bought, I get books from the library on cosmology, you know, and, and, and, microbiology, just it's interesting stuff. Right. So that's really where it comes from. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Then as you, as you made your transition into working as a, as a writer, did you feel like you had writing chops before you started working at the magazine? Or was it sort of like the daily grind of writing that kinda honed your craft? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>Well, it was a little of both. I mean, I was, I was certainly a highly verbal person, and I do not suffer from dyslexia. And, you know, I, I knew how to write. I mean, I had written stuff in high school and college, and so, you know, the, the craft of writing was not something that I had to pick up. It is certainly something that I honed over the course of all of those years for sure. You know, I think when I was, 20 years old, my writing was a lot more, verbose, and there were a lot more long sentences and big words. And one of the things that you learn writing for a monthly magazine for a general readership is how to write short sentences and use little words <laugh> when appropriate. Right. And, you know, so, so that was kind of, the, the process of learning that and learning to write a good lead, you know, I, I didn't necessarily know that, or, you know, and for many years I wrote a lot of the headlines for keyboard too, heads and subheads in the articles, you know, so, there are people who are better at that than I am. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>David Patino, when he was at, doing the Music and Computers magazine <span style="color:red" data-ts="623.025" data-end_ts="623.245" title="623.025" id=c_"623.025">__is__</span> a very clever guy, and he would come up with headlines that I would just go, wow, I wish I'd thought of that. But you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="629.875" data-end_ts="630.165" title="629.875" id=c_"629.875">__this__</span>, these are the kind of skills that you develop. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, how do you take the concept of, you know, I'll use quotation marks here, the craft of writing. How do you take that concept and bring it to something that, I don't want to use the wrong word here, but I'll just say it this way, that that's as mundane as talking about keyboards and people that play 'em. How do you impose sort of like a craft and an artwork of writing into something that is really highly technical? And, you know, quite frankly, before, you know, a lot of the other things that discuss this stuff, the magazines were almost as dry as the manuals for the synthesizers, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>Yeah. And, and over the years, I think we developed an ability to, communicate more effectively in terms of, you know, I mean, if you go back to the very, very earliest product reviews, I don't think we even had separate sections that would say conclusions or Right. User interface. We just kind of wrote stuff. But, so as time goes on, I think you focus more on how to get the message across and, and, you know, certainly when to use a commonly understood metaphor or whatever it might be to let people know. And to you also become very careful about defining your terms and making sure that, you know, if, if you're gonna talk in the early days, you know, if we were talking about, you know, voltage control, let's say, you would want to let people know what that was and make sure you put a definition in so that you wouldn't lose your readers. And so you're constantly thinking about how to bring the reader along and how to make it clear to them what it is that you're saying. So, yeah, you know, that's certainly something that we all developed on the <span style="color:red" data-ts="733.445" data-end_ts="733.605" title="733.445" id=c_"733.445">__job__</span> training. I mean, keyboard, I gotta tell you, keyboard across the spectrum was the best on the job training that anybody could have. I was getting paid for transcribing jazz piano solos, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>Okay. Note for note. <span style="color:red" data-ts="747.815" data-end_ts="748.165" title="747.815" id=c_"747.815">__Right__</span>. And I would, because Leonard Feather was writing a jazz's piano column for us. And so I would sit there, these were in the days of reel <span style="color:red" data-ts="755.405" data-end_ts="755.605" title="755.405" id=c_"755.405">__to__</span> reel tape. You will understand. And I would, I had a reel <span style="color:red" data-ts="759.005" data-end_ts="759.165" title="759.005" id=c_"759.005">__to__</span> reel tape deck, and I would record, let's say, a, a solo of, you know, whoever it might be. And I would play the tape and try to stop it very quickly just after the, the chord or the notes that I wanted to hear, so that it would, those notes would stay in my ear, and then I would scribble them down, and then I would rewind the tape and roll it forward again. Right. This is great ear training. So you've got great ear training, you've got great writing training, and then there's the fact that for 20 years, or a <span style="color:red" data-ts="787.925" data-end_ts="788.005" title="787.925" id=c_"787.925">__little__</span> more, I was writing the record reviews. And so here again, I was exposed to everything from, you know, Zydeco accordion to Elliot Carter piano, sonatas <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>And, you know, amazing. And getting paid for it. So I learned so much about music just from that, because I had <span style="color:red" data-ts="807.485" data-end_ts="807.645" title="807.485" id=c_"807.485">__no__</span>, I had no background in jazz when I started out at Keyboard. You know, I thought, what is bebop? I remember, I think I actually asked Tom Darter one time, what is Bebop <laugh>? And now, you know, I can, when I go to the gym and I'm listening to, to my jazz, station on Pandora, I can go, oh, yeah, that's not Miles. It could be Dizz. You know, <laugh>, I know this stuff now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And I am, I'm sorry for like, focusing on the writing thing, but one of the things that I find really interesting is we're seeing, things like, sort of like the failure of a lot of magazines in, in being able to maintain a business model <span style="color:red" data-ts="844.595" data-end_ts="844.885" title="844.595" id=c_"844.595">__that__</span> works, while at the same time, it seems like writing is becoming more and more important, because it's what you do in order to make a website. And in fact, for things to be searchable, they kind of have to be textual, otherwise they're, you know, they're ignored in a lot of cases. And so it seems like while, while magazines themselves are starting to are kind of disappearing, the primacy of the written word still is right front and center. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>You know, we could certainly talk about the decline of magazines in the 21st century, or about the impact of the internet on, not only the print media, but on, on, the ability of musicians to make a living. I'd rather talk about synthesizers though, because that's the fun stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Well, let's do that because, and I'm in the middle of doing this series of interviews with people that have been involved in, synthesizer design, but I'm really interested in your view of the landscape, because while these guys were sort of like, you know, on the ground floor beating it out, you kind of got a chance to fly at 30,000 feet and see things coming and going and seeing trends develop and reside. I'm curious from your perspective, what you see as the, as the factors that have been most important about synth design over the years. So we could kind of probably break that out into different timeframes. You know, certainly there's the time premit where things, things were developing, and, and that's especially interesting to people now as there's this resurgence of interest in control voltage. And, you know, there for a while there's been interest in vintage synthesizers. Sure. So, from your perspective, what were the things that defined the Premit era, and what were the things that you felt like were the driving factors at that time? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>That's a, a complicated question, and I'm not sure what I, what the driving factors were. I do know that, marketing had a great deal to do with it. There was a guy who, who took mini mugs around to music stores and convinced them to stock one. That kind of thing was what got people interested. That, and, you know, Keith Emerson's Solo Unlucky Man, and Wendy Carlos's albums, those were the things I think that created <span style="color:red" data-ts="992.645" data-end_ts="992.765" title="992.645" id=c_"992.645">__a__</span>, a sense among musicians that, Hey, there's something new here. Now. Pop music is always about finding something new that's an important, characteristic of, of pop music across the board. And so, you know, when this whole thing started to happen, a lot of pop musicians jumped on the bandwagon, so to speak, because they wanted to be able to, present something new and fresh to their, to their listeners. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>That was really, if you go back to, you know, the mid seventies, or the before, let's say the prophet came out in 1978, the Prophet five came out in 1978. So let's say pre 1978, there were certainly people who were grabbing the Monophonic synths. You know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1033.395" data-end_ts="1033.685" title="1033.395" id=c_"1033.395">__Jool__</span> was using <span style="color:red" data-ts="1034.205" data-end_ts="1034.325" title="1034.205" id=c_"1034.205">__a__</span>, a 2,600 <span style="color:red" data-ts="1035.085" data-end_ts="1035.285" title="1035.085" id=c_"1035.085">__and__</span> Weather report, and he was also using, the Oberheim, four Voice. I think when it came out for a while, chick <span style="color:red" data-ts="1041.755" data-end_ts="1042.045" title="1041.755" id=c_"1041.755">__Cara__</span> was using a micro <span style="color:red" data-ts="1042.905" data-end_ts="1043.125" title="1042.905" id=c_"1042.905">__mo__</span> as his solo voice. So these things were, just in the air at that time. But I don't know that that has anything necessarily to do with design. The designs at the time were, were limited by the fact that these were analog instruments, and you can make a certain number of waveforms using an analog oscillator, from what I understand. I mean, you, the reason that they had sawtooth Pulse Square and, triangle and sign Waves was because they were easy to produce using circuits. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>That's what I've been told. Anyway. And then you have to do something with a filter, because otherwise it's just gonna go all day long. And so they put a filter on it. Those were the limitations at the time. Now, there were certainly some innovations that proved durable. I mean, you know, Bob <span style="color:red" data-ts="1090.465" data-end_ts="1090.685" title="1090.465" id=c_"1090.465">__Mug__</span> came up with the idea of the, the pitch and mod wheels that were on the mini <span style="color:red" data-ts="1094.705" data-end_ts="1094.925" title="1094.705" id=c_"1094.705">__mug__</span>. And those are still, I feel, kind of a industry standard, or ought to be. But yet there are other, manufacturers who over the years, from the very beginning, and still today, Roland, for example, with their panel, have gone, oh, no, well, we don't want to do those, you know, we're going to do it our way. And Arp was really the first company that did that. And, and so I call that ARP Think, because what happened was that Arp looked at the mini mug and they said, oh, well, we don't want to do the Pitch and Mod Wheels because they do that. So ARP came up with something that they called PPC, which is, I think was proportional pitch control or something like that. It was a series of three pressure pads that they put on, like the Odyssey, and they just didn't work as well as <laugh> the Pitch and Mod Wheels. So that's, that's why I call it arp think 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>In the pre midi days, or I guess maybe right near the MIDI days, we had the introduction of the Prophet Five, which that was the point at which I started seeing players really embrace keyboards. And I, I always felt like it was because of presets, you know, and I guess other keyboards before that had presets, but it was sort of like the predominance and or the, the big part of that presets played in the case of the Prophet Five that made that a real powerful tool for sort of the every man, because now all of a sudden, you could be really convincing in a band environment without necessarily knowing how to program your synth. Or at least you didn't <span style="color:red" data-ts="1187.485" data-end_ts="1187.565" title="1187.485" id=c_"1187.485">__know__</span> need to know how to program it to begin with. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>Yeah, that's a very important point, because with a MiniMogue, well, one of the early rumors was that there was a famous British rockstar who had a bank of mini mugs, and all of the knobs and switches had been taped with, masking tape so that they couldn't be moved so that he would have the sounds that he wanted. Now, I don't know that that's a true story, but I think it relates to what you were, you're talking about. Yeah. That all of a sudden the prophet had not only polyphony from the keyboard, but it had a system of presets so that you could, in performance, even if you did know how to, program a sound, if you were at a gig, you could dial, you could press one button, and you'd have your string sound. You could press another button, and you'd have your brass sound, I mean, using the words string and brass loosely here. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>And that was a tremendous advantage, even if you did know how to program. But certainly it was attractive, for people who had little or no understanding of what was gonna happen when they turned the knobs. Now, there was a rumor, a persistent rumor in the late seventies, that when profits went back to sequential circuits for repair, that most of them still had the factory presets in them, that most, users were not reprogramming any of their sounds. There was a counter rumor to the effect that people were reloading the factory presets before they sent it in, so that the guys at the factory wouldn't steal their presets 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Oh, that's hilarious. That's great. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>Yeah. I can't tell you which story was true. I, I have no idea. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But they're both good stories, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's neat. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>So yeah, the preset thing, I mean, and, and sound design from the very early days was something that became an important marketing consideration very early on. I don't know who did the sound design in the original profit. I do believe that when the DX seven came out, for example, that, Michael Boer, and there was a guy in San Francisco too, I forget his name, who did the, the original, DX seven Factory presets. It was a fairly primitive process at that time. But, but boy, it was important. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. And I think it's, with very few exceptions, you don't really, there was never sort of like a star mechanism behind the preset makers. I think the, the only name that always jumped off the page for me was whenever, Eric Persing was involved in a preset. I, maybe it's just because his style happened to work with my ear or something, but I always really like caught on when he was involved in some preset creation. Right. But otherwise, there was some, there were some fairly prominent, synth voice des voicing designers or, or sound designers that really kind of went to unheralded, I think. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>Yeah. Eric is certainly the superstar in that field, and he, and he did a lot of the important early work for Roland. I believe he may have done the, the D 50, for example. I don't know that for a fact, but he, he would've at the time, Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know, and over at Corg, I'm pretty sure that Jack Hot <span style="color:red" data-ts="1365.465" data-end_ts="1365.685" title="1365.465" id=c_"1365.465">__Top__</span> was heavily involved in there, in the preset design. Jack told me this story. They were developing the samples for the M1, and, so, you know, he flew over to Japan with a bunch of stuff. And, they were in a room full of the, you know, the Japanese, developers, instrument designers, sound designers and whoever. And so Jack is playing, triggers one of the snare drum sounds from the M1. And, the Japanese guys kind of go into a huddle and they come back out and they say, we think it's too dirty. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>And Jack says, no, man, this is the thing. You gotta deal with this. So, you know, they ended up with the two dirty, snare sound in the, in the M1. But, but <span style="color:red" data-ts="1409.405" data-end_ts="1409.605" title="1409.405" id=c_"1409.405">__the__</span>, I think there was a, a definite difference between, the Japanese culture thinking about instrument design and what the US people were, were interested in. I could, there's another story about that, because the, the story is that Yamaha, engineers for a long time resisted the idea of sampling. And the reason that was quoted to me, and a friend of mine was doing a consulting work with Yamaha at the time, and I think this is probably a, a true story, was that they felt that FM could make any sound, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>And so they didn't need to work, with sampling. And of course, when Yamaha eventually did produce a sampler, it was really, let's, let's be polite. It was not state of the art, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I mean, there was a time where keyboards that were made for the Japanese market actually had different presets, ones that were more finely tuned for, their particular musical styles and, and the taste of their ears. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>I'm sure that that's true. I, I don't know anything about it, but I'm sure it's true. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1476.035" data-end_ts="1476.325" title="1476.035" id=c_"1476.035">__Yeah__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So now one of the, going back to this idea of preset development, though, one of the things I know is that you, in, in your writing, you actually made at least one book that I know of that was about doing synthesizer programming. And so it was something that you sort of personally wanted to see become, I I assume you wanted to see it become popularized, right? People embrace, embrace doing their own preset development. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>I certainly think it's important for any musician in this day and age who is using synthesizers to know how to edit their presets. Absolutely. I think that's, you know, people who just dial up a factory preset, and maybe it works and maybe it doesn't, are missing out on a lot of the, the potential of their instruments. My motivation for writing that book, of course, was that I had been laid off and I needed to, to do some book writing <laugh>. So it, it was, you know, I, and at the time, the, the Backbeat book publishing business was owned by the same company that owned the music magazines, and a friend of mine was the editor at Backbeat. And so I went to Richard Johnston and I said, Hey, you know, how about a book on synthesizer programming? And he was like, oh, yeah, okay, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>So that was kind of just something that, it was a, a case, frankly, of, well, okay, here is my, here's my cynical view of books about electronic music every few years, you know, the publishers, you know, the big publishers bring out more books about daws and synthesizers, and, you know, God only knows what, but it's, in my view, mostly a result of a guy pitching a book to an acquisition editor who doesn't know Jack about electronic music. And the book that is released, my own title for it is always Everything I know about electronic music, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b><laugh>. Okay. You could, you could retitle 19 of these books. Everything I know about electronic music, and, you know, if a guy doesn't know anything about midi, he's gonna put in one page about midi. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1603.525" data-end_ts="1603.805" title="1603.525" id=c_"1603.525">__Right__</span>? If he knows about midi, he's gonna have 50 pages on MIDI and nothing on filters. Right. But the acquisition editors don't know the difference. And so the book keeps getting republished by different authors over and over to some extent. I suppose I was guilty of that, but I did try to keep it focused on, you know, very clearly focused on one particular thing, namely sound design with synthesizers. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>As opposed to other stuff that I happen to know. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>One of the things I find fascinating, just talking with you already is, is you, at some point, back when you started working at Keyboard Magazine, sort of had to learn all this stuff. And it was long before, I mean, you were the, you were the people largely publishing how to use this stuff. So you had to kind of like, make up, make the narrative that people would drive through in order to learn this stuff anyway, right? Sure. And, you know, the, the device manuals might help a little bit, but in general, you were there kind of as we started to say, okay, let's start with the oscillators. Let's look at filters, let's get these things combined. And so I think it's, it's interesting to kind of imagine that you were making, at one point you were making this stuff up, and then by the mid two thousands, you were now kind of reformulating and re or, or packaging this stuff altogether as a book. I mean, did, did it seem like that book building was a culmination kind of thing? Or was it just literally like, I got this to say, so I might as well get paid for saying it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>Yeah, I was kind of pretty much the latter, but I don't know that, you know, I, I can't claim credit for ever creating a, a, a dialogue on the subject of synthesizer sound design. I mean, what I did was I was sitting at a desk and Bob Mogue was writing a column for the magazine, and every month I edited Bob Moog's column, not that he ever needed any editing. He was a very good writer. Once in a while I'd pick up the phone, and of course, this was before the days of email, and I would pick up the phone and ask Bob a, a specific question, but he was a fine writer, and I learned from reading Bob Moog's column just the way everybody else did. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's wow. I mean, what a great teacher, huh, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>Yeah. Well, exactly. And I had, you know, other opportunities like that along the line. I mean, you know, Dave Rossam, I lost track of Dave Rossam for a long time, but, I'm now doing some, some beta testing for the Rossam Electro <span style="color:red" data-ts="1741.865" data-end_ts="1742.185" title="1741.865" id=c_"1741.865">__music__</span>, Euro <span style="color:red" data-ts="1742.725" data-end_ts="1742.945" title="1742.725" id=c_"1742.725">__rec__</span> modules in the early days. You know, I remember phoning Dave Rossam when he was at imu, and I had some question or other, and he explained to me what single sample interpolation was, which is the same as drop sample <laugh>. Right. And why interpolation was important in sampling. And I had no clue. So I picked up the phone and asked Dave Rossam. So, yeah. You know, it was on the job training, you know, with the Gold Star for sure. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Getting back now to the history, one of the things that I've always been fascinated with is the huge cultural shift that occurred kind of in very close proximate times with the introduction of MIDI and the introduction of the pure digital synth is embodied by the DX seven. Right. And I think those two things actually kind of go hand in hand because, because MIDI really put you in a position of desiring like greater polyphony and, and stuff like that. And the digital synth will allow you to do that at kind of a reasonable price point, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>Right? Yeah. The DX seven, I mean, can I tell you my, here's my overview of the DX seven phenomenon, and it was a phenomenon. What happened was that a whole bunch of factors came together in the DX seven that were really remarkable. The first was midi, it was actually the second MIDI synth <span style="color:red" data-ts="1824.925" data-end_ts="1825.245" title="1824.925" id=c_"1824.925">__release__</span>. The first was the prophet 600. The DX seven had midi, it had 16 voices of polyphony, which was unheard of at the time. It <span style="color:red" data-ts="1834.065" data-end_ts="1834.285" title="1834.065" id=c_"1834.065">__had__</span> a velocity and after touch sensitive keyboard, which was, you know, only found in much higher priced, devices at the time, it had a low, low price point. It was 1995, I believe, at the time when it was released, $2,000. It had a sound that nobody had ever heard before. Up to that time, synthesizers had had analog oscillators and analog filters and analog envelope generators. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>And today we prize the analog sound for its quote unquote warm organic character. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But in those days, what struck everybody, including me when we first heard the DX seven, was the detail in the sound. Nothing had ever had that kind of crisp detail that the DX seven enjoyed. And so people were just blown away by that. And all of a sudden analog was kind <span style="color:red" data-ts="1888.445" data-end_ts="1888.485" title="1888.445" id=c_"1888.445">__of__</span>, oh, that old muddy thing that we've all been listening to for the last five years. No, I want a DX seven. You know, now we look back at the DX seven, we call it, you know, cold and, and clinical and you know, digital. But it was really <laugh>, at the time. It had that sound had a very different effect. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, one of the things that is interesting, was interesting to me at the time, is literally seeing people storing their roads because there was this preference for the highly detailed sound of the DX sevens, electric piano sound. Right, right. There was, there was this embrace of like the crisp edges and sort of the way that that intensified the sense of timing when you were playing like <span style="color:red" data-ts="1933.625" data-end_ts="1933.845" title="1933.625" id=c_"1933.625">__syn__</span> syncopated lines and stuff. It was really, it was really kind of a big <span style="color:red" data-ts="1938.765" data-end_ts="1938.885" title="1938.765" id=c_"1938.765">__a__</span> game changer just in terms of how we heard sound at that point. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>Don't forget, it was also highly portable. Oh, right. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="1945.685" data-end_ts="1945.805" title="1945.685" id=c_"1945.685">__the__</span> roads was not highly portable <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's really true. I know more than a few people that end up with back problems because of their love of the roads. One of the things though, that the DX seven also ushered in is something that I think will probably always remain kind of a, a dark stain on it was like the elimination of panel controls. Right now, I think at the time it was very much a cost saving thing. The only way they could make a $2,000 keyboard was to make it so that it wasn't filled with pots. But it really changed the aspect of approaching programming on a synth. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>Exactly. Exactly. And it was a cost thing. And I believe there were actually one or two manufacturers who were manufacturing large hardware DX seven programmers that sent DX seven, system exclusive data using a whole bank of knobs. You know, there's a vintage, device for you. Right. And after that, I think, let's see, there was Poly 61 and, and there was the, the Casio CZ series. There were a lot of instruments, I'm probably forgetting some important ones that, used that same concept. And it was exactly because it was cheap, and it wasn't until, I believe, let's see, the, the Roland JD 800 was a digital synth that had a slider for every function on the panel. Also had a cheap plastic case, if I recall correctly, <laugh>. But that was the point at which, it manufacturing, I think, or the market had advanced to the point where people were going, man, I wanna be able to just grab something and turn it. I don't want to have to dig down into a menu. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So from your perspective, at that time, so, so now you saw in 82, 83, 84, you saw the, the development of analog systems into being these, you know, attempts at Polyphony Profit five, so named, I think because it had five voice polyphony. Right, right. You know, to all of a sudden having first high levels of polyphony, and then multi tamr stuff with the M1, you saw all these things happening while simultaneously the devices became less accessible from a sound design standpoint. Yeah. Now there were attempts to try and make it a little easier to work with. So you saw the evolution of the computer for Sequencer, and then eventually the computer, like patch editor systems. But I don't really, I never really felt like those took off the way that they, that they might have. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>Well, patch editor, software was quite the thing for a while. And in fact, I believe, there's still, mid Quest still makes patch editors. I think they're the only company that's still in that business. But yeah, it was important. And Patch editors were written for, for the Atari, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2118.745" data-end_ts="2118.965" title="2118.745" id=c_"2118.745">__for__</span> probably for the Commodore 64, certainly for the Omega. And, you know, when the Mac, came along, you know, then patch editors were a big deal there. I mean, opco did it quite nicely, I'm sure, for a long time with their, patch editing software. But while it was, it was certainly an improvement for editing, but it was not an improvement for performance. Right, right. And that's a key, that's a key concept in the whole thing. I think if you, if you think about synthesizers, really, there's the, the sound design, the, and the sound capabilities aspect of it, and the sound editing and and storage aspect. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>But the performance thing is something that really these instruments are even today, you know, they're so deep. I mean, I use reason a lot, I'll be honest. You know, great software synthesizers, the way Propellerhead has implemented their automation system, I think there's a, a hard limit of like 128 parameters that you can automate <laugh>. And so some of these instruments have 200 parameters, and there's just gonna be some things there that, you just have to <span style="color:red" data-ts="2188.845" data-end_ts="2189.125" title="2188.845" id=c_"2188.845">__steer__</span> the preset because you can't automate 'em, you can't tweak 'em in performance. Right. So, we're all struggling with this, but I think, and I think the performance aspect has a lot to do with the attraction of the, of the Eurorack format and modulars in general. But let's just talk about Eurorack. 'cause it's, it's ubiquitous, you know, is the fact that you can actually reach out and grab a knob, and you don't have to know anything in order to be able to do that. In other words, if you can figure out how to plug an output into an input using a patch cord and then twist a knob, you'll get something 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>Yeah. And that, it's certainly not the case on the DX seven and, and not the case on just about any, you know, hardware, keyboard, synthesizer that I can think of. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, the other thing that happens with the Eurorack system is you're literally thrown back to prior to the profit where there's no preset, even if you have a module like say the, the mutable Instruments, braids that has the concept of preset, sort of like voicings, right? That's just like the starting point. You still have all this work that have, that you have to do, which I think by its very nature, means that you're going <span style="color:red" data-ts="2259.565" data-end_ts="2259.605" title="2259.565" id=c_"2259.565">__to__</span> end up with an idiosyncratic sound, one that somehow owns your own personal voice. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>In theory, yeah. Among the good, musicians who are using the Eurorack, I mean, if you think of somebody like Richard Divine, for example, he certainly does have his own voice. He also has more equipment than God. But, you know, whatever that, and that becomes, we, we won't talk about the necessity to go <span style="color:red" data-ts="2284.125" data-end_ts="2284.205" title="2284.125" id=c_"2284.125">__out__</span>, rush out and buy modules. I'm over that. But it, yes, you do to some extent have your own voice. You don't have the even, the ability to store a whole preset. And to me, as a musician, you know, I'm, I'm not mainly a sound design guy. I'm mainly a musician. I play Bach on the piano, and if I go to compose something, I wanna be able to edit my performance. And, you know, you can't really do that with the Eurorack system. It's all on the fly. It's all live real time 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>There. Like the Bookla 200 E-Series, they attempt to do the preset thing. Right. But I'm not always sure even how that can work, because at some point, the chords are gonna come out and you can't preset chord connections. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>Right. I think Don had some kind of system. Don Bookla had some kind of system where whereby you could plug a whole bunch of, outputs into a, a programmer module and then get, outputs from that to go to other places so that you could leave the patch cords there while you folded up the case and took it on the road. And when you got there, the programmer module would know which input to route to which output. Oh, I see. He did have something like that. But yeah, the 200 E-Series, I mean, it aspired to be a programmable modular synthesizer, but it never really accomplished what it set out to do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, if we want to talk about sort of the concept behind presets, the, the place where that really does hold sway is in the DAW, the digital and the software synth world. Oh, yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2380.645" data-end_ts="2380.805" title="2380.645" id=c_"2380.645">__But__</span> there again, you got a chance to see that whole world sort of like formulate in front of your eyes. Right. Because I, I remember, I think that the first time that the digital audio thing really caught my attention in Keyboard magazine was a cover article where Thomas Dolby was talking about using op code studio Vision, Uhhuh <affirmative>, and how this like interplay of audio and synthesis and all this kind of stuff was so cool. And then Cubase came out with the VST spec first for effects and then for instruments. And how, again, in the course of a very short period of time, it went from, you know, kind of this dream that someday this digital stuff will deliver to being an all-out explosion. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>Yes. Yeah. And, and there, but there again, there's a long, long history there. Okay. The first software synthesizer, I believe, that actually used the CPU was the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2443.035" data-end_ts="2443.325" title="2443.035" id=c_"2443.035">__SEER__</span> Systems reality, which, Stanley Young Leb, who had been at Sequential for a while was very heavily involved in reality that had actually physical modeling, it had various other things. What reality also had was it would only work with the Creative Labs sound card. So I think Creative Labs may have had a little bit of, investment interest in that. I don't know the details of that. I'd have to ask Stanley, and he might or might not tell me. No, he's, he's a great guy. But, you know, from there, it kind of took off. And yes, within a few years we had all of this stuff. But see, that was at the end of a previous system of development, which was computer-based synthesizers on dedicated boards that would plug into your pc. And that goes clear back to the Apple two, not the MAC two, the Apple <span style="color:red" data-ts="2493.585" data-end_ts="2493.805" title="2493.585" id=c_"2493.585">__two__</span>, when, both Alpha Centara and Passport Designs sound chaser were synthesizers on a board that plugged into your Apple <span style="color:red" data-ts="2503.225" data-end_ts="2503.445" title="2503.225" id=c_"2503.225">__two__</span> computer. You know, that was the ancestry, out of which the CPU based instruments eventually sprang when the CPU got fast enough. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, and then also, I guess like the synclavier and the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2517.365" data-end_ts="2517.605" title="2517.365" id=c_"2517.365">__Fair__</span> Lights, those were computers just with a very approachable face slapped on top of 'em, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b><laugh>. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. And, and they were, I think as much a dedicated computer system as the DX seven, the DX seven, the DX seven accomplished what it did because, the, engineers had put the whole darn thing they put John Channing's, algorithms on a chip. Right. And that's why it was so affordable. Now, I don't know what the actual circuit design was, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2547.035" data-end_ts="2547.525" title="2547.035" id=c_"2547.035">__sinlair__</span> or the, Fairlight. I do know that the Fairlight in its earliest days had a separate circuit board for each voice, because it would do eight void. I'm, I'm having a flashback here to the early days, but I, my memory is that in the original <span style="color:red" data-ts="2563.415" data-end_ts="2563.765" title="2563.415" id=c_"2563.415">__faite__</span>, if you wanted to sample something, you had to store the sample on each of the eight circuit boards in order to get it to play an eight voice polyphony. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>Wow. So there were early systems like that. Can I tell you the, the sad, sad story of somebody who was trying to compete with the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2578.805" data-end_ts="2579.245" title="2578.805" id=c_"2578.805">__Fairlight__</span> and, and the SIN <span style="color:red" data-ts="2580.005" data-end_ts="2580.205" title="2580.005" id=c_"2580.005">__CLA__</span> era? Yeah. Okay. This is like, this had to have been, the mid to late eighties, let's say, 85, 86, because I know that the DX seven had already come out at that time. So these people came around, and I don't remember the name of their company, and it's, it's a sad story. So even if I did remember, I wouldn't tell you, but, they had this high end digital synthesizer system with the CRT display and the big freestanding keyboard in the box with the CPU in it, and they brought it around the keyboard to show it to us. Right. And it was essentially doing like additive synthesis with like 16 partials, and it sounded like a really bad Hammond organ <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>And so I was desperate to try to get some kind of good sound out of this, this thing. So I said, well, gee, does it do fm No, it doesn't do fm. Well, you have an LFO, right? Yeah. You have an <span style="color:red" data-ts="2634.125" data-end_ts="2634.885" title="2634.125" id=c_"2634.125">__F-O-L-F-O__</span>. Could you like modulate the, the, the, pitch of the thing with a really fast LFO? Let's try that. Right? This is my idea. So they're like, oh, yeah, cool. Let's try that. The problem that that showed up was that they cranked this LFO up to something, you know, 15 hertz or something, which was as fast as it would go. So I play a chord on the keyboard and it, you know, the, the, the notes on the keyboard are going, and I lift my hand from the keyboard and the notes don't stop <laugh>, because they were using the same processing unit to pro to create the LFOs that they were using to scan the keyboard. And the processor was so busy generating all of those LFO waveforms. It didn't have time to look at the keyboard and see that I lifted my hand. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh my God. That's wild. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>True story. And, and they, I don't think they ever brought it to market. So <laugh> Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Unreal. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>That tells you a little bit about the desirability of beta testers trying weird stuff, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, right? Indeed. Well, you must have gotten a chance to see a lot of, you know, both unusual, but also like really quirky stuff. I remember, 360 Systems was always one of my favorite companies to check out, not because I liked their stuff or even that it was that good, but it always seemed to have something quirky related to it. Right. Yeah. And it was always fun to sort of like, see what would, what would kind of go crazy with something that 360 was putting out. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>Yeah. You know, I had entirely forgotten about them until you mentioned the name. And I could not at this moment tell you one single thing that they ever did. It was just not on my radar at the time. I mean, I'm sure it was at the time, but you know, there was a memory dump in the middle there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>There you go. The memory dump. Now we're starting to see kind of a, an a revolution of, of how people think about synthesizers. First of all, you know, we're seeing sort of, again, the ubiquitousness of, of on system control, you know, having a lot of discreet controller content on <span style="color:red" data-ts="2758.645" data-end_ts="2758.765" title="2758.645" id=c_"2758.645">__a__</span> face of a keyboard, or in the case of like eurorack and modular stuff, very knob oriented, very, tactile interaction with the syns. And we're starting to see even things like with the recent announcements by AKI of drum machines that are gonna be standalone units that basically are computers, but they're oriented towards playability and interaction, physical interaction. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2784.315" data-end_ts="2784.605" title="2784.315" id=c_"2784.315">__Yeah__</span>. Do you, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2785.225" data-end_ts="2785.445" title="2785.225" id=c_"2785.225">__how__</span>, how do you think that that's going to affect this, you know, what had become a really important, a really significant part of the music tech business, which was software synthesis and software instrumentation. Do <span style="color:red" data-ts="2800.125" data-end_ts="2800.325" title="2800.125" id=c_"2800.125">__you__</span>, do you think that things are going to revert more towards hardware again? Or do you think that this is just one of these deals where, people are gonna embrace it all because they can and it's all kind of affordable? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>Well, I mean, as, as a former science fiction writer, I can tell you that predicting the future is a mugs game. You can't predict the future. So I, I try to avoid answering questions that say, what do you think is going to happen next? Yeah, sure. I do think that there is, that people, yes, people want playability. They want a box that they can, take on stage and they just, they press a button and they know what they're gonna get for good reasons and bad reasons. I think the laptop has kind of a bad wrap as a, as a live performance device. Yeah. Sometimes your system is <span style="color:red" data-ts="2848.245" data-end_ts="2848.445" title="2848.245" id=c_"2848.245">__gonna__</span>, crash on you, but really not, and not, if not, unless <span style="color:red" data-ts="2852.805" data-end_ts="2852.965" title="2852.805" id=c_"2852.805">__your__</span>, your roadie drops it off the back of the truck, you know, or unless you are busy downloading stuff from the internet that you don't know what it is. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>You know, I've never had that big of a reliability problem, but I'm not doing paying gigs. Right. So possibly, my, my view of that situation is skewed. But there again, a laptop does not really have the kind of, user interface that a device with 16, you know, velocity sensitive drum pads has, let's say. Right? I'm still waiting for the corded keyboard that's velocity sensitive. You know, why haven't they done that? You know, or with foot pedals, you know, why doesn't, why doesn't your computer have foot pedals? I mean, wouldn't that be useful? But at the same time, the possibilities for upgrading and, expanding your computer-based system are extraordinary. And you're, you're just not gonna find that in any kind of dedicated hardware system. I mean, Chris Halley was trying to do that with the Muse receptor. He may still be doing it. I don't know. I haven't been keeping track of what they've been up to lately. They were trying to put, you know, vsts in a box that you could take on stage and it would be reliable, but it didn't have the user interface 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>At that point. It's just a box, which is no better than your computer, except it doesn't have a screen that, I don't know, I'm, I'm not gonna get into what I think of the Muse receptor, because really I haven't done anything with it since I saw the prototype many years ago. But I do think that the expandability of the, any computer-based system, you know, that you can get vsts that have, you know, physical modeling or sampling or, I mean, look at some of the stuff that Native Instruments has done with Reactor or with the, with contact, for example, that contact now you can buy these, third party libraries that have their own user interface with, you know, a built-in rhythms and, and all of this other great stuff that you can do. And you're just not gonna get that on, on an <span style="color:red" data-ts="2969.525" data-end_ts="2969.725" title="2969.525" id=c_"2969.525">__aka__</span> drum <span style="color:red" data-ts="2970.345" data-end_ts="2970.565" title="2970.345" id=c_"2970.345">__box__</span>. Right. Let's face it, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's an interesting point. And especially the contact engine thing. The, the contact library system thing is actually a really interesting point to discuss because the, the computer came along and it became a platform to develop software on. And so we did VST <span style="color:red" data-ts="2990.565" data-end_ts="2990.885" title="2990.565" id=c_"2990.565">__Sense__</span> and effects and some daws, well, native Instruments has, I think that they've taken this contact system and turned it into another kind of platform, like a meta platform in a way. Right? Right. And, some of the stuff I've seen lately, like the stuff the Spitfire audio people are doing is amazing and, sounds so gorgeous, but they're literally developing almost engines that run inside of contact. Right. So it's like an engine in an engine, in an engine. It's, it's quite amazing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>Yeah. I, I, I reviewed a couple of those first efforts in that direction during the last days of my product reviews for keyboard. And unfortunately, what happened there was that the, this is an aside, but the, publishing company that owned <span style="color:red" data-ts="3039.805" data-end_ts="3039.925" title="3039.805" id=c_"3039.805">__a__</span> keyboard and has now rolled it into electronic musician put out a new contract for, their freelance writers in the contract had a couple of provisions that I was not comfortable with. And so I did have to stop writing for them, which, which is a shame, but, you know, it's like that was the way it went down. But I did see a few of those, early programs for contact. And I think the same thing is true totally of, of Reactor that it's a development system and reactor, again, that leaves us right back to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_%2774">Cycling '74</a> and for that matter, to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data">PD</a> and C Sound and Super Collider, that these are systems in which the Intrepid, developer <span style="color:red" data-ts="3078.065" data-end_ts="3078.285" title="3078.065" id=c_"3078.065">__or__</span> amateur developer can do anything, but <span style="color:red" data-ts="3082.075" data-end_ts="3082.565" title="3082.075" id=c_"3082.075">__they're__</span> expert systems. They're not on a Kai Drum <span style="color:red" data-ts="3084.705" data-end_ts="3084.925" title="3084.705" id=c_"3084.705">__box__</span> where you can just turn, or a URE system where you can just turn a knob and you get something. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. You start off with, you have to do a lot of work in these systems and but to get that first squeak out of it, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>Right. It's, and it's not only set up work, it's, conceptual work to understand, you know, how things hook together. And then I think the musical difference, and, and I thought about this when I was, when I was working on my C Sound book, and so I was reading, listening Rather to some C sound music, and it struck me that the composers who work in CS Sound are mostly people who start with an idea. And that's not how I start rating a piece of music. If I start working on a new piece of music, I launch reason, and I sit down and mess around on the keyboard, it doesn't start with an idea or a concept. It starts with something that I like the sound of. So I think there's a real conceptual divide there between the composer who uses experimental, do <span style="color:red" data-ts="3144.045" data-end_ts="3144.165" title="3144.045" id=c_"3144.045">__it__</span> yourself software, and the composer who uses, something that might have a lot of presets and a midi keyboard. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I've never thought about that, but I just recently did an interview with a guy who talked about, who's very into the Eurorack thing. His discussion about his composition technique was that he would start off by the, the thing he was most interested in was the evolving of tones over time. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So he would start off with the big evolving narrative, and then he'd go back and he'd rhythms or base or whatever. And my head was like, twisting, because it's like, I would never think of adding the rhythm last, you know, <laugh> somehow that just like, seems antithetical, but all of a sudden when I, I kinda rethink about it, and I say, okay, the thing that you are actually, the, the thing that represents your voice isn't necessarily the arrangement or even the composition. It's this tonal narrative. And so, yeah, of course you'd want <span style="color:red" data-ts="3203.365" data-end_ts="3203.485" title="3203.365" id=c_"3203.365">__to__</span> start there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>Right. And, you know, sometimes when I listen to, experimental, electronic music on the web, I, I find myself wanting to say to the composer, well, listen, could we, could we just listen to that without the kick drum <laugh>? Right. Because they, yeah. They start with this amazing sound design thing, and then they go, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3221.755" data-end_ts="3222.045" title="3221.755" id=c_"3221.755">__boom__</span>, right, boom, boom. And I'm like, no, dude, get it out of there quick. But then you have to understand, I'm over 65 and I never go to dance clubs, so that's not my thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, it's not your thing, but the, the flip side of it is, I'm gonna, I want to come back to this. This is, you spent 20 odd years at Keyboard Magazine and since then you've still been active. I'm lucky enough to be, able to see your Facebook feed. And so I, I see that you're still active in the game, right? You're still playing with <span style="color:red" data-ts="3251.575" data-end_ts="3251.925" title="3251.575" id=c_"3251.575">__since__</span>, and you're still, you know, fooling around with modulars and stuff like that. So you've, you've maintained, you touch on all this stuff over the long run, which kind of makes it so that you're a little bit immune to the taste of the day. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>Yeah. I mean, as I, as I said before, you know, reviewing records for 20 years at keyboard, broadened by taste rather considerably, you know, I, I got into the residence, I got into Skinny Puppy, I got into Meat <span style="color:red" data-ts="3277.845" data-end_ts="3278.085" title="3277.845" id=c_"3277.845">__Beat__</span> Manifesto, and then I would, the next day I'd be listening to Igor Kipnis, play Harpsichord <laugh>. But I, I have to say that, you know, I, it has now been, God help us 15 years since I left keyboard, I was pushed out the door in 2002. And so I would have to say that I'm not nearly as well in touch with what's going on today as I was 15 years ago. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>One of the things that's happened though is, is there's also somehow the barrier to become a manufacturer has been lowered. Oh yeah. Massively. And so where it used to be, you'd have to track five or six or maybe eight significant companies in their work. Now there's 200 as a starting point <laugh>. Right? So it's a little difficult too, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>Just in the, in the Euro <span style="color:red" data-ts="3327.665" data-end_ts="3327.885" title="3327.665" id=c_"3327.665">__rec__</span> format, you know, there have to be, you know, 30 or 40 companies who are active and, and more who have maybe one or two modules that, that are cool and that sell. And the same thing if you look at Rack extension developers and Reason, I mean, there are dozens and dozens of these companies, and they're, some of them are doing extremely interesting stuff. And yeah. How would anybody keep track, you know, <laugh>, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, man, I burned through my time and then some, I really appreciate you spending the time. Just a couple more questions though. Yeah. And these are just sort of like things I'd like to know about you. First of all, you've gotten to see the whole history of electronic music stuff, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>Well, I mean the, the history goes back to 1899. I'm not that old. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, the, of the modern version of it then, let's say. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3374.605" data-end_ts="3374.685" title="3374.605" id=c_"3374.605">__Oh__</span>, okay. Okay. Sort of like from Mogan, right? Yeah. What, what to you has was the coolest thing that you laid your hands on and what's the thing that you wish that you still had in your living room or in your den? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>Well, my general answer to that question is that in most cases, I, after selling a, a musical instrument, I regretted it <laugh>. That's across the board. And, you know, I've certainly had a few things that I didn't regret selling, but I can't even remember what they were by now. But, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3407.445" data-end_ts="3407.685" title="3407.445" id=c_"3407.445">__that__</span> what is the coolest, I mean, ask me again tomorrow and I'll give you a different answer. Sure. One of the things that was really cool for me, and this is a historical anecdote, but the Surge Modular in those days, this was like 1980 or 81, and our publisher, Jim Crockett, had a, a rule which went by the boards fairly quickly that we couldn't have a product review of a product that was actually going to be at the NAMM show. And the issue would be at the NAMM Show because he didn't wanna play favorites. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>Right. And so we had to scrounge around and try to find something that wasn't gonna be at the Nam Show in order to review it, which is why we ended up reviewing the Surge Modular Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And at this point, Tom and Dominic own Profit Fives, which were very cool. And I thought, I wanna do something different. So I bought a Surge Modular and I wish I still had it, but that was really, I think, one of the extremely, cool things that I enjoyed having in my living room. And at the time, I think I had an eight track task <span style="color:red" data-ts="3464.845" data-end_ts="3465.085" title="3464.845" id=c_"3464.845">__game__</span> reel <span style="color:red" data-ts="3465.405" data-end_ts="3465.565" title="3465.405" id=c_"3465.405">__to__</span> reel tape deck, and I would record multi multi-tracks of Surge Modular. You know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I remember that the surge review in keyboard, what did you write that review? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>I don't remember In those days what happened was that Dominic was writing, the keyboard reports as we called them then, and that I actually came up with the phrase keyboard report in the shower one morning. <laugh>, I'm not kidding. It was two days before we went, sent the magazine off to, to the printer, and we couldn't figure out what to call the product reviews. <laugh> <laugh> and I came up with that. So, but Dominic wrote them for the first three or four years until he got sick, and Dominic became very ill and was in the hospital for quite some time. And at that point I moved over and started doing the product reviews. So I couldn't really tell you whether I wrote the surgery review or not. Interesting. But as far as other cool things, I mean, I now have a nice Euro Rack modular that is an attempt to recapture my lost youth, you know, <laugh>, I'm trying to get back to the, to the surge days. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>You know, it's a wonderful thing and I love it. And, most often I end up, you know, turning on my computer and using reason because I have an embarrassing number of rack extensions and reason. And the whole system as a whole, I mean, people think of Reason as a DAW, but it's really a single vast modular synthesizer. Right. You know, being able to patch different stuff to different stuff. It's a modular and, it's also, you can save your work and edit your work. And, so I would have to say that I don't, I don't get paid by Propellerhead for promoting their work, but, I would have to say that the coolest thing for me these days is definitely reason. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's interesting. So when you sit down to have fun, it's sort of like reason with the modular on the side, and that's music making fun for you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="3572.285" data-end_ts="3572.565" title="3572.285" id=c_"3572.285">__Yeah__</span>. Unless I'm in the, the living room playing from the, Well-Tempered Clvi on my, on my very nice Yamaha piano. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Or playing the cello, which you, you continue <span style="color:red" data-ts="3581.645" data-end_ts="3581.805" title="3581.645" id=c_"3581.645">__to__</span> write. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>Yes. Yeah. I, I actually teach, I have about a dozen cello students and for a retired guy, you know, that's a very nice way to supplement my social security. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Awesome. I've always enjoyed your writing. Where would I go or where do I pass off my listeners to go and keep up with what writing you still do? Do you, are you still active writing about stuff? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>Not really. I mean, as <span style="color:red" data-ts="3605.045" data-end_ts="3605.165" title="3605.045" id=c_"3605.045">__the__</span> music technology writer, I would say I'm almost entirely retired at this point. I'm probably going to be editing a book by Francis Prev this summer. At least that's the plan. But as far as whether I'm going to be writing anymore about, electronic music, I do have a blog that is my music blog. I have two blogs, one of which is devoted to, writing fiction right now, since I'm not writing fiction right now, I don't wanna send anybody there <laugh>, but my, my music blog is called synth age.wordpress.com, and that's all one word, synth <span style="color:red" data-ts="3636.405" data-end_ts="3636.605" title="3636.405" id=c_"3636.405">__age__</span>. The reason I chose that was because all the good URLs were already taken <laugh>. But you can think of it as synth as in like roughage or, or, or, you know, it's a nice, Anglo-Saxon Suffix or as synth age being like new age, or you can think of it as synth old guy, you know. So it works <laugh>, it's synth <span style="color:red" data-ts="3657.245" data-end_ts="3658.525" title="3657.245" id=c_"3657.245">__h.wordpress.com__</span> and I do put new music up there and once in a while, I, reflect a bit on, some music technology that I've, gotten involved in. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, that's fabulous. Well, Jim, I want to thank you so much for this hour. It's been, it's been so fun to talk to you, to get to know more about you and kind of get a sense of your, of your vision for both history as well as where we're at right now. It's, it's really interesting and I won't put you in a position of having a cast out in the future either. So, there's that. But thank you so much for your time and I hope we'll get a chance to talk again soon. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jim: </b>Yeah. Hey, thank you. I appreciate it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright, we'll catch you later then. Goodbye. Wow, we, what a great conversation. I could have talked for hours more, but we <span style="color:red" data-ts="3704.245" data-end_ts="3704.405" title="3704.245" id=c_"3704.245">__had__</span> to respect his time and had to respect your time too. Thanks so much for listening and I'm gonna bug out quick, so we'll catch you next week. Bye.
