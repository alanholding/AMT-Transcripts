<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. This week, for podcast number 50, I wanted to get a special guest, and I was able to wrangle him into it. Luckily I am getting him in between some crazy release stuff and a trip to Berlin and all that stuff. And, so I'm feeling pretty lucky that we have the opportunity to talk to Joshua Kit Clayton Joshua works with me at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_%2774">Cycling '74</a> He's the, chief technology Officer, director of engineering, and, probably one of the smartest people I've ever met. And, one of the people who's most savvy about code. So it's really, great to get a chance to work with 'em, and it's also great chance to talk to him today. Hey, Joshua, how are you doing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua Kit Clayton: </b>Good, too kind. Thanks, for having me. And, hello all you, podcast listeners, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Yeah, thanks. We actually have a, we've developed a really nice audience. I'm pretty pleased, and, and it seems like people are going kind of out of their way to introduce one another to it, so, it's been a really neat organic growth <span style="color:red" data-ts="82.84" data-end_ts="83.12" title="82.84" id=c_"82.84">__through__</span> the podcast. I'm pretty excited about that. Cool. The way that I tend to do this podcast is I, I tend to start it off by asking people to tell me a little bit about their background, and that normally generates like the next 10 questions. But, so let's start you off with that. Can you tell me a little bit about your background and particularly what in your background has, developed or <span style="color:red" data-ts="109.58" data-end_ts="109.8" title="109.58" id=c_"109.58">__was__</span> existed to make you the person that you are now artistically? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>Oh my Lord. There's, how far back do we wanna go? <laugh>. So, anyway, been making music for a long time, I guess I started playing cello when I was five, and then cello wasn't cool to me. I wanted to be, I wanted to be just like this childhood friend, Josh Gilbert, who, was a piano player. So I switched from cello to piano, and, as I got older, my attentions kind of turned towards break dancing and bmx and then skateboarding, kind of all of the, all of the, trends of the day in the, early eighties. And, then I got into synthesizers. So around the same time, you know, when I was in junior high actually, <span style="color:red" data-ts="164.54" data-end_ts="164.76" title="164.54" id=c_"164.54">__and__</span> before that I was really into, computer programming and synthesizers. And the funny thing is, is that's sort of where I ended up later in life, which, you know, when you ask people what they wanna do when they're kids become a fireman or astronaut or whatnot, rarely is that the case. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>And, so the funny thing is, somebody was, somebody was talking to me recently <span style="color:red" data-ts="189.16" data-end_ts="189.38" title="189.16" id=c_"189.16">__and__</span> maybe a couple months back, and they're like, oh, you're doing exactly what you planned, but you're like 10 years old. So, yeah. So in junior high, yeah, I got my first synthesizer I used to go over to, it's so funny how, yeah. Anyway, I used to go over to, to my friend's house, and he had, he had a synthesizer and I was really amazed with how it could make helicopter sounds with like a sharp l f <span style="color:red" data-ts="222.7" data-end_ts="222.82" title="222.7" id=c_"222.7">__o__</span> on, white noise or something like that. But <span style="color:red" data-ts="226.3" data-end_ts="226.7" title="226.3" id=c_"226.3">__anyway__</span>, so he inspired me to get a synthesizer at some point, and I convinced my mother who was, you know, anything to placate one of the three young boys as a single mother, was happy to do. And, we had, my friends and I, we had like a joy division and New Order and Cure cover band, you know, back when it was alternative music. And, that was sort of my first foray into, electronic music, which was, it was tons of fun. And our, our band name was called the Ukrainian Beet Farmers <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, man. It's awesome. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>Yeah. Anyway, it <span style="color:red" data-ts="273.58" data-end_ts="273.7" title="273.58" id=c_"273.58">__was__</span> funny times. And then, yeah, my first year in high school, they, the high school I went to my freshman year actually was a huge high school. When I went, there was like 3,500 students in, in the suburbs of Chicago. And, they had an electronic music studio, and all the older kids, the, like seniors were like DJs and making and DJing, like acid house and stuff like that at the time. And I didn't even understand what Acid house was, but, they're like, oh, you just hook up the drum machine to the synthesizer. So I started trying to make acid housed by like taking some, whatever crappy drum machine they had connected to, Cassio <span style="color:red" data-ts="321.84" data-end_ts="322.06" title="321.84" id=c_"321.84">__CZI__</span> 1000, <span style="color:red" data-ts="323.76" data-end_ts="323.98" title="323.76" id=c_"323.76">__and__</span> just having random <span style="color:red" data-ts="326.05" data-end_ts="326.34" title="326.05" id=c_"326.05">__mini__</span> notes triggered Casio 1000. Right. And thinking I was making, thinking I was making acid house. But anyway, so it was that. And then whatever, a lot of punk bands and other little bands in high school and then went to, went to college at Wesleyan where, they had a really great electronic music department <span style="color:red" data-ts="349.84" data-end_ts="350.06" title="349.84" id=c_"349.84">__and__</span> experimental music department. And I was through that, that I got back into coding again. And, yeah, so, and it was the rave era and yeah, that's, that's kind of like a, a brief synopsis of like my first 20 years of my life. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Now, at Wesleyan, well, first of all, I have to say I'm pretty blown away that you had an opportunity to go to a high school that had electronic music lab, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>Mr. Mr, Mr. Mack, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Mr. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>Mack, that, that was our teacher. He, he was like an amazing trumpet player and had a huge underbite, and he was, in charge of the marching band or the student band. And, yeah, he also led, he was amazing, actually. I wonder what that guy's up to nowadays. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. My wife, teaches at, at a school and, you know, just, they get technology like laptops or tablets or whatever, but things are locked down so heavily that you can't actually do anything hardly with them. How did they accomplish a high school electronic music studio without having it? So like the drum machine was bolted to the table or something? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>There was no issue with it. It was like, oh, I can't remember if we had keys or if we had to, like, we had to sign in and sign up for time. It's kind of typical of like a college, right? I mean, it was big college. I went to, you know, the high school when my brother went <span style="color:red" data-ts="446.26" data-end_ts="446.5" title="446.26" id=c_"446.26">__there__</span>, it was 6,500 students, but 74 when I was born was, the Nader of the, you know, birthing in, right. In the us. Right. And so, it halved in size like in six years. So I don't, I don't know what that was about. Everyone was too drugged out and going to the disco or something <span style="color:red" data-ts="470.22" data-end_ts="470.46" title="470.22" id=c_"470.22">__like__</span> thousand <span style="color:red" data-ts="471.18" data-end_ts="471.74" title="471.18" id=c_"471.18">__74__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Apparently. <span style="color:red" data-ts="473.81" data-end_ts="474.1" title="473.81" id=c_"473.81">__Okay__</span>. So you went to, so you went to Wesleyan and kind of followed up. Now, did you, at Wesleyan, did you study computer programming or did you study electronic music or some combination of the two? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>Well, I got <span style="color:red" data-ts="487.53" data-end_ts="487.65" title="487.53" id=c_"487.53">__a__</span>, I started out thinking, I went there with a definitive plan to, I wanted to make synthesizers and, they had some program, I think with, Caltech or something like that where you could go for, three years at, a liberal arts college. And then you go two years to like an engineering school and you could get a dual degree in physics and electrical engineering. And that was like my total plan that I wanted to do that and, you know, be a hard, you know, at that point, you know, it was only just at that time that, like computers were starting to, do real <span style="color:red" data-ts="532.42" data-end_ts="532.62" title="532.42" id=c_"532.42">__time__</span> processing. The power PC had just come out and, hyper Prism had just come out. But, so at that point it was still sort of like hardware was the route that you would've taken or that I imagined myself taking. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>And after my first, semester, I was doing, I, I was in the physics program and, which I really liked actually. But, I was also, taking some, you know, electronic music survey courses with Ron Ola was kind of like my mentor throughout, throughout college. And, it was in those classes I started, I started doing a little bit of c programming, and, working with, C music and other music, five variants and stuff like that. And so I took my second semester, I took, you know, a, a computers, the intro computer science class, which was like programming and scheme, a lisp variant. And, it was during that course where I was like, oh, and I was actually, I think actually talking last two nights ago with Stefan about like the immediate gratification of computer programming and where, you know, in physics it's interesting stuff, but it's kind of dry. And even if you're doing something hands-on, there's a lot of time that it takes, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>You know, to get results. And also, but with computer programming, it's this, it totally, especially at that age in your life, it's so immediately gratifying that, you know, you feel like you do this thing, it gives you feedback anyway, and, and it directly related to my electronic music class. So, I switched majors my sophomore year to computer science and that, that's what my degree <span style="color:red" data-ts="654.45" data-end_ts="654.61" title="654.45" id=c_"654.45">__is__</span> in. But, I did do a lot of electronic music and continued doing coding within, within the electronic music department at that point. A lot of my stuff was in fourth, formula. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, which, was the, yeah. Fourth base music language that, Ron had had worked on. And then also H M S L, which was another fourth variant where we would use it as a controller for, assembly that we would code for the DSP 5,600, the, yeah, the microprocessor that was being used, you know, kinda commonly. And, <span style="color:red" data-ts="696.75" data-end_ts="696.97" title="696.75" id=c_"696.75">__mo__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="697.08" data-end_ts="697.37" title="697.08" id=c_"697.08">__roll__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="697.47" data-end_ts="697.69" title="697.47" id=c_"697.47">__one__</span> and, 56,000 rather. Right. So yeah, those are the days. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, I, I think it's, the way computers are now, it's kind of hard to underst hard to even wrap your head around how low level you had to work in order to pull off realtime audio. What kind of timeframe was this that you were doing the studying at, at Wesleyan? What, what 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>Years? Yeah, that's like 92. 92 to 96. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So that would've been when, a desktop machine was, was gonna have trouble doing a whole lot of real time audio. Wouldn't that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>Well, yeah, it was like Power pc, that was like the first, right, first kind of like consumer computer. We also had some, next station, some pizza boxes. All right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="753.09" data-end_ts="753.21" title="753.09" id=c_"753.09">__Yeah__</span>. And, those actually could do some, realtime DSP on the 56 K chip that was embedded, although I didn't do too much realtime stuff on those. I did mostly music <span style="color:red" data-ts="765.92" data-end_ts="766.21" title="765.92" id=c_"765.92">__five__</span> style, like, off offline 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>Work, but, basically, what was it? It was like audio media two card, which, you know, you could put inside your, power pc. Right. And, you could upload, you could upload, you H M S L, you could upload assembly code and then have it output the audio. But yeah, at that same time, you know, like Hyper Prism had just come out and you could do some processing there. The other big thing that we worked with was, <span style="color:red" data-ts="799.16" data-end_ts="799.45" title="799.16" id=c_"799.16">__kema__</span>, which you couldn't really easily do DSP programming on that platform at that point. I'm not sure where it's at nowadays, but, you could do like small talk programming for UI and control rate stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>With their, with their DSP blocks. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, how did you, eventually run into Max then? Because, I mean, by this point, by 96, max was already kind of floating around as a MIDI processing tool, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>Yeah. And actually, you know, I mean they had Max in the studios in college, but mm-hmm. <affirmative>, I never used it, back then because most of the MIDI stuff I was doing was in Formula. Sure. And we would, you know, sim similar things to Max, but you know, this interactive fourth <span style="color:red" data-ts="852.96" data-end_ts="853.28" title="852.96" id=c_"852.96">__based__</span> environment. And I remember, oh, what were those, what were those? There was like a box for Pitch to Mid conversion, like a pitch writer or two or whatever it was called. But I remember, you know, we were doing pieces with that going into Formula and then processing, the pitches and coming up with, you know, real time accompaniment and cord changes and stuff like that. Sure. So I didn't actually use Use Max at all, in college, but kind of similar types of things that one would do with Max. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>And, and then, you know, I moved out to San Francisco. I thought I, I really wanted to, I really wanted to be a plugin developer, and I thought like that there was like a world where you could get hired to make sound <span style="color:red" data-ts="913.62" data-end_ts="913.78" title="913.62" id=c_"913.62">__it__</span> at 16 plugins. Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="916.6" data-end_ts="916.82" title="916.6" id=c_"916.6">__Cuz__</span> that was like one of, one of the, one of the, you know, available desktop plugin formats at the time that I learned how to do. And I, it was like impossible to get a job doing that. Although I ended up working for a company after doing some web programming that, did make some sound at 16 plugins, although they just had me doing tech support and working on the like web interfaith and like the UI for a web MIDI plugin back then. Oh, okay. Anyway, who was that name? That was in Envision Interactive. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>And we, they had a, yeah, the cyber sound with the name of their suite of, and the, their like basically virtual sound canvas or whatever their general <span style="color:red" data-ts="966.24" data-end_ts="966.53" title="966.24" id=c_"966.24">__midi__</span>, sent for web browsers. Then I worked for a traffic software company that, you know, did, you know basically like what Google Maps does now, dynamic route guidance based on, conditions. And, somehow through the, through like the club nights I was going to, at the time, actually I think it was in front of static, which, my friend Seth <span style="color:red" data-ts="994.42" data-end_ts="994.64" title="994.42" id=c_"994.42">__AK__</span> and other friends were DJing at at the time, my friend Darren, Darren Marshall, who actually used to work at Op <span style="color:red" data-ts="1001.76" data-end_ts="1001.96" title="1001.76" id=c_"1001.76">__Code__</span> with, David or New, new <span style="color:red" data-ts="1005.34" data-end_ts="1005.56" title="1005.34" id=c_"1005.34">__Up__</span> David or something like that. And, he told me, oh, there's this thing that you would be really into called msp. And, I downloaded it, bought a copy, and then the same day I downloaded the program, I downloaded the S D K and started <span style="color:red" data-ts="1028.94" data-end_ts="1029.43" title="1028.94" id=c_"1028.94">__loading__</span> some Max Externs. And after about a month of using it, I sent a resume with those externs to, and, yeah, so the fir my first, my first use of Max was with s p and, pretty early on in the first year or two, it would've been 98 in <span style="color:red" data-ts="1056.53" data-end_ts="1056.75" title="1056.53" id=c_"1056.53">__the__</span> fall of 98. And then all of a sudden I got lucky and got hired and, yeah, so I only had about a month or two months of working with Max before working with cycling, so 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's really interesting. But it <span style="color:red" data-ts="1080.1" data-end_ts="1080.34" title="1080.1" id=c_"1080.1">__sounded__</span> like a lot of your background kind of set you, set you up in a good place for that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1083.98" data-end_ts="1084.26" title="1083.98" id=c_"1083.98">__school__</span>. Now, before we get further, maybe into Max, I want to talk a little bit about, something you just hinted at there, which is, you know, standing outside of static, talking with your, you know, where some of your friends DJ'd and talking with other friends about tech, tech stuff. You were actually part of a scene in San Francisco that really produced some amazing stuff back in the day. And I used that back in the day thing as if it was my day, but it really wasn't, you know, but I feel like 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>Well you were making some techno around that time too. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I was, but my maybe 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>A little bit earlier. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. And, and mine was also really very much of the Midwest Dent, which was sort of like, you know, heavy, heavy on the 9 0 9 with a, with a little bit of evil sprinkled in. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>Hardcore <span style="color:red" data-ts="1143.46" data-end_ts="1143.58" title="1143.46" id=c_"1143.46">__G__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>That's a cool time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It was, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1147.2" data-end_ts="1147.42" title="1147.2" id=c_"1147.2">__it__</span> wasn't 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>Milwaukee scene. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, the Milwaukee scene was really pretty exciting at the time, and it was especially interesting because there was like some kind of direct tunnel between Milwaukee and Belgium, so we were doing a lot of stuff Oh yeah. That was getting all of its play in Belgium. Right. And so you'd get pictures back of all these guys in white tracksuits dancing, you know, and they'd say, ah, they're dancing to your track man. And I'm like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1171.89" data-end_ts="1172.18" title="1171.89" id=c_"1171.89">__that__</span> was awesome. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b><laugh> batter Dam <span style="color:red" data-ts="1174.84" data-end_ts="1175.06" title="1174.84" id=c_"1174.84">__for__</span>, and yeah, all the, all the, the Dutch and the Belgium, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, the Dutch <span style="color:red" data-ts="1180.5" data-end_ts="1180.66" title="1180.5" id=c_"1180.5">__and__</span> the Belgian were nuts about that stuff, but the scene that you were involved in really was, what now I think we, we, just kinda lump into a group as part of the glitch scene, but it seems like, you know, when, when I was kind of watching happen, it was really kind of an interesting thing of sort of, you know, the embrace of glitchy behaviors, but also a lot of, a lot of influence from dub and, a fair amount of psychedelic influence. It was a really kind of interesting milieu that was developing out of San Francisco. What, can you tell me a little bit about what, what that was like from your perspective? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>Yeah, it was interesting. It was, it was a fun time for sure. Basically, right after college I went out to San Francisco and, a couple friends of mine came out from the East coast as well. And we were all, you know, Chicago House, Detroit Techno and Berlin Techno. So, and we got to San Francisco and for the most part we were kind of like, oh, this is really weird. Cuz the San Francisco scene overall was more concerned with, you know, west coast breaks and progressive trans and progressive house and stuff like that. And being young, we were pretty arrogant and kind of like, screw this stuff. And, we started doing, we started doing underground parties that were all kind of focused on, on like Chicago, Detroit, and Berlin. And, we met up, there was a couple people that were doing, that were doing parties, out in San Francisco at that time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>One was mad, which was, you know, a techno night. And then static started up and those were kind of like the, the two different kind of club nights that were kind of like the music that we were into. But this was still like much more dance floor focus, which, you know, the glitch stuff kind of like ended up diverging from that. Right. But, those were like the two, the two main things where, we met up with folks there and we were doing, we were doing underground parties and we brought out Richie Houghton and we brought, brought out, a bunch of, Chicago Dance Mania folks, like DJ Funk and Milton and Dion, and then like ghetto tech from Detroit, which is like Godfather and a bunch of folks. And yeah. Anyways, so it was still kind of like very underground rave focus, which with a hard edge, everything with a hard edge, which was like really important to us at the time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>But a lot of the people actually that were doing that also had this kind of background with experimental music, like, you know, doing stuff in college or otherwise with, with, kinda like I was discussing before, you know, these, these more, electroacoustic or experimental, electronic works. And so that bled into the music and we were really obsessed with the whole lineage of, basic channel and chain reaction from Berlin, which had this <span style="color:red" data-ts="1378.72" data-end_ts="1378.94" title="1378.72" id=c_"1378.72">__dub__</span> influence. And so kind of all these different things, collided this kind of aggressive underground club music from Chicago and Detroit and Berlin and experimental stuff at that time. It was like interesting, like the, all the people that kind of came together around that were like, like the first record I did was with Juan Mendez for a label that we were doing called Sidetracks. And, yeah, he's like really big right now as, silent Servant. And that was like, that was like a super, super fun collaboration and a lot of, a lot of others are, are still working on stuff and, and, yeah, it's cool how it still lives today in some, some form. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, yeah, I was gonna say a lot of the people that were your friends and then your collaborators, have gone on to do, some pretty, extensive stuff. I mean, EK is certainly still very active. Yeah. And I know, you did some, you, you kind of hung out with but also did some work with, Blackham, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1451.87" data-end_ts="1452.22" title="1451.87" id=c_"1451.87">__Black__</span> Blackham from <span style="color:red" data-ts="1452.86" data-end_ts="1452.98" title="1452.86" id=c_"1452.86">__B__</span> Blackham. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yes. Yes. And you know, you worked with, and, and kind of hung out with these people, right? Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>And that, that was like another, another area where the kind of experimental stuff came in. Cuz they both were in the Mills program and the Mills program Yeah. For those that don't know a long running, fabulous experimental music department. And so they were making this maniacal techno music, and they used to, they used to host, actually, it was like so great. It was underneath the seating of the main auditorium in this kind of warm, ambient heating space. And I don't know if like the school even, approved of them doing it, but they used to do the, these nights called Lobule and they would open up the, the sort of like moist nostril of the auditorium for people to, play there. And I played there and Wobbly played there, and B <span style="color:red" data-ts="1508.9" data-end_ts="1509.14" title="1508.9" id=c_"1508.9">__Blackton__</span> played there and lots of, lots of our friends did. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="1512.72" data-end_ts="1512.94" title="1512.72" id=c_"1512.72">__so__</span>, yeah, there was a period also where Safety scissors, Seth Horvitz <span style="color:red" data-ts="1520.32" data-end_ts="1520.54" title="1520.32" id=c_"1520.32">__Sek__</span> and, Kristen Erickson, Kevin Ham, were all living together. And I would spend tons of time over there with all three of them. But yeah, so the Blems, it was, that was really fun to like meet up with them and they were one of the first releases on the record label that we ended up doing a little bit later called Hor Zurk. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, I was going to, I was going to transition into that because, a lot of the people that we're talking about make up the, you know, certainly the first half of the releases or of the catalog of that label. Right? <span style="color:red" data-ts="1556.32" data-end_ts="1556.54" title="1556.32" id=c_"1556.32">__Yep__</span>. So I have to ask Earth <span style="color:red" data-ts="1558.96" data-end_ts="1559.38" title="1558.96" id=c_"1558.96">__Lauren__</span> Mek the name, where'd that come from? I'm, I'm just really curious. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>Yeah, so it was just, just, kind of, pig English variant of Earthling music. Okay. <laugh>. Yeah, we, we had this, we actually had a TRAs lore tour on our website that would, translate everything basically just rep replacing every V with or, but, it was, some slightly different logic. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, there was, there's this sense, you know, from the outside, and I would say that certainly I, I was, an outsider of this world, even though I, I watched it with, with great excitement. But there was also this sense that in addition to being interesting music and music that kind of embraced the techno concept while, while still pushing it forward, there was also this sense of it being really smart people's music. Right. And, and knowing now some of the people that, that, you know, make up some of your early running crew there, it, it really was a lot of really intelligent, really highly educated people, people that were equally at home busting code as well as busting out music. How did that, how do you think that ended up influencing the, the scene and the music that was created? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>Yeah. I mean basically it was, it was all friends, or not exclusively, but primarily friends. And somehow there was this, I don't know if it was, it was also in, in other cities, but in San Francisco there's like a long running weirdo nerd culture, that also is into, you know, parties and dancing and psych psychedelics. I mean, if you, you know, go back to the seventies, you know, it has this kind of long history. And then through the nineties, the whole Mondo 2000 cyberpunk scene and this, that and the other. And so there was like a lot of overlap between that sort of psychedelic, esoteric culture with, like hedonism and dancing and things like that. And so, well, I don't think there was like a direct lineage or something like that. There was like some cultural blurring there, or somehow that's how we ended up there, many of us. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>And, and actually it was right when we started Horne Zurk at the end of the nineties, it was sort of like, okay, raving had sort of run its course for a lot of us in a way. And we were, we were looking into, what are some things that, that we wanted to do that deviated from that, you know, the original, originally, you know, this, you know, techno and house music and stuff like that felt really subversive and kind of a political act to get together and, dance all night in basements and warehouses and stuff like that. And by the end of the nineties, it sort of had, become, you know, like the new norm. And, so we kind of, as typical young people do wanted, wanted to do something different and some, some of the other, other influences that we had blurred in to a greater degree. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's interesting you mentioned sort of like the Mondo 2000 culture, because I feel like on one hand that sort of spread the word, you know, they, and like Wired magazine and the techno <span style="color:red" data-ts="1782.33" data-end_ts="1782.68" title="1782.33" id=c_"1782.33">__yuppy__</span> kind of thing that they promoted, seemed to really, it, it popularized it and it kind of spread the word, but also it seemed to have kind of normed that whole culture, a culture that seemed to actually really want to be underground. Did you see things change in kind of a not particularly fun way at that point? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>Well, that was, that was kind of like the first big tech wave that, at least in my history in San Francisco was the late nineties during the, sort of web bubble and whatnot. It didn't feel so, I mean, there <span style="color:red" data-ts="1821.92" data-end_ts="1822.08" title="1821.92" id=c_"1821.92">__was__</span> some cultural effects of that. And actually, like, looking back as I compare it with like the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1827.33" data-end_ts="1827.68" title="1827.33" id=c_"1827.33">__brave__</span>, that's sort of the current current bubble in San Francisco, with, with tech at the time, I think there was also sort of like yuppies go home, like screw this. And, you know, you had, you had all these elements as part of that, including some of the people that were involved in that sort of cyber punk world. But I, I wasn't that deep, into, into that universe. I mean, I had read Mondo 2000 earlier in the nineties when I was living on the East Coast and was like, ah, that place seems cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>But once I got out there, it wasn't really too much, too much in my purview. There was a huge, anti gentrification wave happening at that time as well. And it's interesting to look back and how much it, you know, how basically as I see it, three, like there was like sort of this burst about the web and then there was like a contraction where people weren't sure whether the web was really a thing. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, that was gonna happen. And then the web was sort of established and then social media and you had sort of the mid 2000, 2005, 2007, you had the second wave and that was, more regarding social media <span style="color:red" data-ts="1900.79" data-end_ts="1901.08" title="1900.79" id=c_"1900.79">__then__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1901.22" data-end_ts="1901.44" title="1901.22" id=c_"1901.22">__oh__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1901.44" data-end_ts="1901.64" title="1901.44" id=c_"1901.44">__is__</span> that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1901.76" data-end_ts="1901.96" title="1901.76" id=c_"1901.76">__viable__</span>? And then now there's this third wave where all these things are totally established, there's no turning back and it's, I mean it's depressing some days, but, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>When I look back at the, mu catalog, I see that <laugh>, there's some, there's some good memories there, but one that jumps out to me that I kind of wanted to talk to you a little bit about is the Gold Chains album. Oh yeah, that was, that was actually a pretty big deal in San Francisco, wasn't it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>I don't know that it was a huge deal in San Francisco, but it actually probably sold more copies in Europe than anywhere in the US San Francisco. Oh, really? <span style="color:red" data-ts="1944.78" data-end_ts="1945" title="1944.78" id=c_"1944.78">__Did__</span>. But, yeah, I mean it was really fun to work on and, there was, you know, like within like a small scene, there was like a lot of excitement surrounding it, but big by any means is, you know, a very relative term. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well that was, that was kind of a different, a different release for you because I mean, I had really interesting, conversations with Tofor Tofor Lafata, who's the, who was the gold chains, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1978.88" data-end_ts="1979.1" title="1978.88" id=c_"1978.88">__had__</span> interesting conversations. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1980.2" data-end_ts="1980.42" title="1980.2" id=c_"1980.2">__Cuz__</span> first of all, he mentioned that he had gotten some opportunities to do like, commercial, music and stuff like that based on that release, which was, was pretty interesting. But also he talked a lot about the influences that you had on in the making of that, you know, particularly with some, editing, stylistic editing things and stuff that, you brought to the table for that release. And I just, I'm curious about your memories of the make of making that thing as well as making the video for it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>Yeah, it was, it was like a really fun time. We would just go into the studio and, I mean, Topher is brilliant, total freak. And, you know, not that I'm not a freak too, but somehow our freakiness came together in ways that for each of us, was really playful and, sort of, you know, we would change the style in some of the songs, you know, every eight measures or so, or 16 measures. And, just, just had a lot of fun, which was really nice for me at the time since a lot of the music I had been working on was more sort of like, focused and modal, techno music that sort of like stayed in a certain musical sphere, which I love a lot, but, it didn't have as much playfulness. And so, there was something about working with another person that also, made it, made it more free for that kind of play, which I really loved. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Yeah. Well it was, it was definitely fun. So, and when you first mentioned this to me, you mentioned it by saying, Hey, check out this video. So I had not heard the music before I saw the video and here rolls this video with like a bunch of people I know, some of 'em being friends, doing this thing. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="2103.6" data-end_ts="2103.82" title="2103.6" id=c_"2103.6">__now__</span>, did you work with Ruben on that video? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>Yeah, Ruben shot that video, yeah. Okay. With, one of his early videos. And it was, you know, it's been great to see his whole trajectory where, the first video he ever really made after college. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, we're talking about Ruben Fleischer, we should make that clear, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>Oh, right, yeah, yeah. Ruben Fletcher, who, is now a big time Hollywood director and close friend, and, he had, he had a vision of what he wanted to do, he wanted, he wanted to direct and, so he went to Chicago and Detroit and did, I think it's up on YouTube still, a documentary about Chicago Ghetto Tracks and ghetto tech in, Detroit, interviewing a lot of the people that we knew from doing parties in the nineties. And, that was the first thing he did. And then he started directing music videos and Topfers was one of his early ones. And you know, he later went on to do one of Mia's first videos and Dizzy Rascal's first videos and a bunch of other, really talented artists. So, he just kept with it and now he's doing big features for Hollywood, so. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's, that's, that's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>Been fun music. Yeah. Yeah. Back in the day. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Back in the day. So we're gonna jump back into kind of your, professional stream a little bit because I mean, you were weaving artistic work, so, you've sort of downplayed the amount of, of music that you've done, but you did releases on, on a fair number of labels as well as your own, but also you, were always kind of active in, in doing live performance and in doing DJing as well, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>Correct. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And at the same time, you were starting to sort of like push the envelopes on, software development. So this would've been roughly the time, about the time that that, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2225.4" data-end_ts="2225.62" title="2225.4" id=c_"2225.4">__mu__</span> the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2226.15" data-end_ts="2226.5" title="2226.15" id=c_"2226.15">__Earth__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2226.5" data-end_ts="2226.78" title="2226.5" id=c_"2226.5">__Lauren__</span> Musar, catalog was being built up. That was roughly the same time that you also were working on the development of Jitter, which was the video extensions for Max, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>Yeah, actually, you know, I, I started working for cycling about, at the same time that we started working on the record label for Orland <span style="color:red" data-ts="2244.88" data-end_ts="2245.1" title="2244.88" id=c_"2244.88">__mek__</span>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2245.12" data-end_ts="2245.34" title="2245.12" id=c_"2245.12">__And__</span> a lot of the stuff was going on, in parallel. It was after working at Cycling for a couple years that, yeah, I had been doing live performance and, started to, you know, dislike just doing the implicit performance of the machine operator. And then I started working on, some video software for, doing performance in, conjunction with the audio stuff. And, yeah, so it, it was all, it was all very contemporary <span style="color:red" data-ts="2279.87" data-end_ts="2280.22" title="2279.87" id=c_"2279.87">__early__</span>, early, early two thousands. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So Did you ever sleep? I mean, it seems like so much was going on for you at the time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>Yeah, I, I have no, I mean, I was working like crazy cuz the, when I was first working on Jitter, it was after I was working on my cycling stuff because I was just doing it on my own before I, talked with David about whether or not he would be interested, in having it as like a cycling, release. So at that point, yeah, I was working a lot and actually, actually I had just released a couple albums, prior to that. And actually while I was releasing, sorry, while I was working on Jitter, I wasn't doing a lot of music production, so there was like a couple years, like 2000 to 2002 where I wasn't doing tons of music production a little bit here and there, but interesting. So, so it did kind of like alternate, like before that I was focusing all my extra time on recording and DJing and stuff like that. And then I kinda shifted my, you know, whatever this spare time is, I usually have one or two things that I get pretty pretty heavily into. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. I'm always curious about people who, sort of began working one in one area and kind of switch into working with other media. And for you that switch was from music and coding around music to the video world. What, what drew you into video, first of all, and secondly, how comfortable of a transition did that feel? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>It's one of those things where, it's always nice that, you know, you, you have some sort of, you gain some sort of facility in one area and you kind of wanna keep moving and, you know, kids learning and growing and stuff like that is maybe the, the thing that, that at least I, but many, many people value. So, it felt, it felt pretty normal and natural and it was just something like I didn't know a lot about and I wanted to do some stuff with and just started learning as I went. And, and then that kind of continued away from video stuff into sort of performance art and group exercise and all this other weird stuff that, I end up doing, you know, from more of a traditional art practice. But, yeah, so it was, it was pretty seamless actually. And there was actually a fair amount of overlap with kind of making music, performing music, performing music and video, then working more on video than migrating to live performance video, then moving just to performance without any video. So, there was a lot of, a lot of overlap and all those things, so it felt, it felt pretty normal and, you know, always kind of learning as I went. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that's cool. Now let's, let's kind of, fast forward to the present because we're running out of time already. I can't believe it. But, you have, for a while you, you kind of were outta scene, but you've kind of stepped in pretty thick. Again. First of all, you're doing this live performance work under the name Kit and Claws, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>Yeah, I'm with my friend Brian Hock who makes music as, claw C Period L period <span style="color:red" data-ts="2480.66" data-end_ts="2480.78" title="2480.66" id=c_"2480.66">__A__</span> period w s 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So that has like all of the, that has all of the weight of like an evil oh oh seven kind of a thing. Does that actually stand for anything or is it just part of the fun? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>It does stand for something and I can't remember. You'll have to ask Brian. No, I knew what it stood for, but I can't at all. No, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. So how did you start, how did you start with that collaboration? How did, how did he draw you in? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>We were just hanging out and, we like each other's music a bunch and, he is like, oh, we should do like a, a set together. I just got, he actually, had just bought like a stack of, HR sixteens or stacked, it was like five units, like a couple MMT eights and a couple, HR sixteens, some of which didn't work. And, he <span style="color:red" data-ts="2535.14" data-end_ts="2535.22" title="2535.14" id=c_"2535.14">__was__</span> like, yeah, you should come over and we'll just work on something to do, like a live set. And so, went over and, we both had a great time. We both, again, like these collaborations are really fun times for me where <span style="color:red" data-ts="2549.38" data-end_ts="2549.5" title="2549.38" id=c_"2549.38">__I__</span> can be really playful and just have fun with music. And, so we did that, you know, basically got some sandwiches, some beers, and, hung out and made music. And the whole time, like every time really that we get together and work on stuff, it's just like us jamming. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>It's not a lot of talking or discussion about what we wanna do. We just turn on the machines and start, recording, sequences and jamming with each other from that, we, started doing a couple shows and then we're like, oh, these are cool, these are really fun. Let's start tracking 'em. And we started tracking a bunch of stuff. And actually in, a month or two, our first first release is gonna come out on Google <span style="color:red" data-ts="2591.73" data-end_ts="2592.02" title="2591.73" id=c_"2591.73">__Land__</span> electrode, which is kind of like a, a niche niche dark synth label out of the Netherlands. Oh. Sub-label on phone <span style="color:red" data-ts="2600.93" data-end_ts="2601.22" title="2600.93" id=c_"2600.93">__tore__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2601.92" data-end_ts="2602.14" title="2601.92" id=c_"2601.92">__all__</span> right. What's kind of unique about this, especially as it comes to your playing is that it's, it's an all hardware performance, right? I mean, you don't use computers at all, is that correct? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>I mean, we don't use personal computers or laptops. I mean, obviously, you know, the, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2620.61" data-end_ts="2620.83" title="2620.61" id=c_"2620.61">__HR__</span> 16 and, MMT eight, they're computers, but, sim sim simpler computers perhaps. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. But it is, I mean, you're, you're doing all of this through a hardware, a musical hardware interface, which is, that's kind of interesting. And it's in a way too, it's a bit of a throwback to some of your earliest music experience, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>Yeah, there's a lot of that. And it's also, you know, spending the day job working on coding, it's really nice to just kind of have some sort of separation Yeah. Between, you know, working on music for fun and, what I ha what I get stressed out about and am not sleeping properly because of, at work. Although, I mean, I still use computers for a lot of other stuff, but for this project it's, it's very hardware focused. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What are some of the other projects? What are some of the other things you're working on, artistically right now? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>The other, the other big thing that's, a collaboration with my friend, is, is a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2682.66" data-end_ts="2682.86" title="2682.66" id=c_"2682.66">__noise__</span> project called ua, which is, Estonian for Killjoy. And that's an all hardware project as well, but more kind of noise or ambient or something like that. And that uses actually modular synth stuff and, you know, guitar pedals or tabletop electronics. So again, that's, you know, a nice, deviation from some of the day job, although a lot of the same principles. I mean, doing analog modular synthesis is very similar to working, with Max and things like that. But, it's nice to just have some sort of boundaries in my life. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, that, that makes a lot of sense. Now, one of the things you said a bit ago too was, and if, if this is an area you'd rather not talk about, that's fine, but, you talked a little bit about how you had, at one point viewed the music that you were doing, as and, and especially the rave culture thing as sort of a political act now. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2751.34" data-end_ts="2751.62" title="2751.34" id=c_"2751.34">__Yeah__</span>, I thought that was an interesting use of phrase because in addition to the many things that you are, one of the things I know that you are, is very pally aware and you're active in political actions of different sorts. Is this something you feel comfortable talking about? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>Sure. I mean, basically all this cultural stuff, I do view as a political act as well. And you know, I mean, if we go back to my younger days as a, in high school being straight edge, vegetarian, communist, and then kind of like drifting away from kind of like some sort of explicit form of politics in, in a more sort of diffused cultural politics. Right. In recent years got much more involved with all the stuff that's happening worldwide as far as these different mass movements, whether it's, you know, occupy or, some other variant. But yeah, was, was very involved in, in the Occupy stuff in the Bay Area and, it was, it was super exciting time to actually see some, some amount of, cultural momentum in that space and political momentum with people on the ground. And, you know, while I'm not there in Ferguson, and definitely, very supportive and in solidarity with the actions of people on the street, you know, fighting, police suppression and the incredibly, racist society in which we live in, you know, whether it's, a relationship to education, to incarceration, to actual murder on the streets, it's, it's, there are things that I feel strongly about <span style="color:red" data-ts="2853.4" data-end_ts="2853.62" title="2853.4" id=c_"2853.4">__and__</span> somehow, even though it might seem sort of oblique, there's some, there's some sort of relationship with, working on culture making, music, taking acts where you get to get together in a physical space with other people and dance that somehow seems, directly opposed to the very, very controlled society that we live in. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>So definitely a big part of my life and, the things that I'd like to see if I'm, if I'm gonna spend any time working on something in this world, hopefully it would contribute somewhat to, trying, trying to, trying to do things differently than economic militaristic control. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. You know, when I think of you, I think that there's not that much disconnect between how you, what you do in your coding life and what you do in your performance life, but also what you do in your, political life. I mean, you, you seem to kind of embed all of these in everything that you do. I'm wondering if that's conscious or if that's just how, that's just what happens when you live that life. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>Well, I guess, well, thank you. I guess there are some, like, there's overlap. I mean, there's definitely, there's definitely certain impulses and trends I guess, that kind of lead to these different things. There's some sort of parallel, whether it's cultural, spiritual, political, technical or something like that. But also, I don't know, the human mind is, very adept at matching pattern. So while the actual experience in these things, is very different actually, in these different worlds and, and like important to me that I have these different, different aspects of my life and, you know, I think everybody has, has, that it does make an easy narrative somehow, but some of that narrative I think is maybe superimposed. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Perhaps. So in any case, at least again, from, from my seat, that's the way it looks sometimes. So I'll say it that way. Man, we've gone well over our time now, but, and I want to thank you for the time that, that you spent with us now, before we go, one, one of the things I would like to kind of talk about and, and this is sort of on behalf of the listeners as much as for my own interest, I think that one of the things that a lot of people would be curious about is what you think is sort of like a trajectory of an artistic and technological combined life. So, you know, the, the track that you took, which was to have a heavy technical but musically related education, and then you <span style="color:red" data-ts="3029.18" data-end_ts="3029.38" title="3029.18" id=c_"3029.18">__move__</span> to San Francisco before it's much of, you know, there's much of a thing happening there. You sort of develop a scene and then, San Francisco blows up and all this kind stuff. That kind of option doesn't really exist, or certainly following your exact tracks doesn't exist. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>Oh, and I wouldn't recommend trying to follow like, any sort of traditional model that any others have done, but maybe, maybe in some general terms, I guess. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, how do you think, how do you think that people can find, what do you think is a way that people can use to find their own own track? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>Mm-hmm. <affirmative>? Well, I definitely wouldn't encourage any roadmap. I would be like the roadmap, step number one, basic, basically continue like some process of self investigation. Don't take yourself too seriously, spend, you know, spend time. I mean, finding the time to like deepen an investigation. Not that like, you know, I'm a big fan actually of deism and like exploration and not taking things seriously, but also, you know, having serious fun or something like that, would be something I would encourage. But I don't know. I mean, the cultural landscape nowadays is, significantly different than when, I was growing up. And, there's really cool stuff that that's happening, whether it's kind of like the Southland music scene or younger people making, techno music or just kind of off the wall stuff that doesn't really make any sense given like a traditional cultural narrative or something like that, that I think basically, basically people are doing it sometimes little frenetic and blind or like chaotic, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3141.4" data-end_ts="3141.62" title="3141.4" id=c_"3141.4">__and__</span> I actually love that. So, keeping some chaos in your life I think is probably something I would encourage. But, I don't know how to, how to offer any advice to anybody <laugh> as to, as to doing two things and, I don't know, self investigation, larger social critique, patience, frenzy chaos. Those would be the things that I would, I guess, encourage. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's interesting you say that you don't, you don't think that you actually have any advice, but the advice you give is the advice that not that many people put out there. You know, if you, if you Google, gimme some artistic career advice, you know, they'll say, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3183.6" data-end_ts="3183.82" title="3183.6" id=c_"3183.6">__oh__</span>, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3184.8" data-end_ts="3185.02" title="3184.8" id=c_"3184.8">__dig__</span>, find a good school, blah, blah, blah. You know, nobody's saying embrace chaos. But I think that that, that's a really great point. Embracing the chaos at the time is really how you put yourself in a position to activate interesting things. Exploring broader context is also something that is actually the antithesis of what a lot of current thought is. And maybe that actually does end up being a lot more, a lot more legit advice than you might think. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>At this point in my life, I'm trying to follow the younger people. So <laugh>, there 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>Go. I want their advice. I don't wanna give 'em advice, I wanna follow theirs 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Very, very wise. Josh, I wanna thank you so much for, spending the time with us. I know you're really busy and I know that you, just did some traveling, so you're probably really Bush as well. But I appreciate you talking to us. Thanks for being my, 50th guest on the podcast. It's really great to have you, be a part of it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>Well, thank you. It was my pleasure. And as much as interviews somehow make me uncomfortable, this was a lot of 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Fun. Well, thanks. Yeah, likewise. And for me it was great because I got to know a little bit more about you too. And if nothing else, we got to <span style="color:red" data-ts="3262.5" data-end_ts="3262.74" title="3262.5" id=c_"3262.5">__talk__</span>, talk smart about some of your friends, which is always great as well. Thanks a lot and have a great day. I'll talk to you soon. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Joshua: </b>Okay. Take care. Bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And there you have it. Lucky number 50 is in the bag that represents one year's worth of podcasts. I had to take two weekends off, one of 'em for illness, one of them for a trip down to fabulous Taos, New Mexico, other. Otherwise, I started one year ago. And, it's really been a fantastic trip for me. I really appreciate all the people that, were willing to, be, interviewed or chat with me or whatever you want to call it. But also, I really want to thank all the listeners. We've had a tremendous amount of, feedback from people that listened, and you've <span style="color:red" data-ts="3323.21" data-end_ts="3323.5" title="3323.21" id=c_"3323.21">__made__</span>, helped make this one of the more interesting and important, podcasts that are out there. So I want to thank everybody for your participation, for all the people that have helped in a variety of different ways. I want to thank you as well. And with that, I'm going to sign off for, year number one of the Art, music and Technology podcast. Thank you so much.
