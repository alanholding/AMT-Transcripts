<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. This week I am very pleased to, get a chance to talk to an amazing artist. His name is Tarik Bari. He is a, an extraordinary visualist. He is a composer, he's a media artist <span style="color:red" data-ts="24.545" data-end_ts="24.765" title="24.545" id=c_"24.545">__and__</span> always imaginable. And he's taken some time out of his busy schedule to talk to us for the podcast. So, with that, I'm gonna say hello to Tariq. Hello. How's it going? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik Barri: </b>Hi. I'm doing very well, thank you. Yeah, happy to be here in your podcast. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thank you so much. Well, why don't we kick this off by having you talk just a bit about, what your current work looks like. What kind of stuff are you doing right now? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>Yeah. My current work, involves, an audio visual project that's a solo projects, that I'm working on right now. And also there's this, there's two, visual projects where I'm providing the visuals next to another musician who's doing the music. So basically everything I'm doing, is somehow audio visual, but in, in some projects I'm taking just the visual, you know, side of it. And in, the solo projects, I'm doing both sides of it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure, sure. Now, one of the things I noticed from just a quick perusal of your, of your website, and I'll make sure that I have a link in the show notes for this Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, for your site. But, one of the things I noticed is that you, you have a pretty active, work both in live performance type environments as well as, installation work, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>How much <span style="color:red" data-ts="109.485" data-end_ts="109.645" title="109.485" id=c_"109.485">__of__</span>, how much, what is your balance of that? Do you tend to do more of one or the other, or is it kind of an equal, equal thing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>Actually, all of my work, stems from the same source. And with that I don't just mean, my brain, I also mean it's, it's, it's also all coming from the same program in a way. No, not in a, it's literally the same program. I can put, I've got this software data programs, which, I named <span style="color:red" data-ts="137.805" data-end_ts="138.005" title="137.805" id=c_"137.805">__ome__</span> and, in <span style="color:red" data-ts="139.685" data-end_ts="139.885" title="139.685" id=c_"139.685">__ome__</span> I can put it into an installation mode or into a live performance mode, or into a pure, visuals mode. Much, much work that I put into making an installation is also <span style="color:red" data-ts="151.465" data-end_ts="151.685" title="151.465" id=c_"151.465">__the__</span>, also simultaneously function as work that can be used during a next visual performance or during <span style="color:red" data-ts="158.165" data-end_ts="158.285" title="158.165" id=c_"158.165">__a__</span> next audio visual performance. So, the balance is even then hard to describe. Yeah. It's, it's all the same thing, but with slightly different emphasis. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That's, that's actually interesting that you would have the same software be able to do both, because it seems like they're two such completely different worlds, especially since, I mean, with your, with your installation stuff, do you do anything that's like reactive, like either audio reactive or, you know, sensor-based or anything like that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>I have not yet used, sensor-based, things, but actually that's what I wanna do for the next installation that I'll be, <span style="color:red" data-ts="200.235" data-end_ts="200.525" title="200.235" id=c_"200.235">__that__</span>, that, that I'll be creating. 'cause I want people to have a really nice intuitive, sensor-based way with which they can move through the virtual 3D environments that I <span style="color:red" data-ts="213.125" data-end_ts="213.325" title="213.125" id=c_"213.125">__create__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. And so that's interesting because one of the things I feel like when I, when I watch your, when I watch your performance work Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> it seems to be like audio reactive, except you've made a point of saying that it's not, you don't actually have a pipeline of audio into your program. Instead, you are kind of the sensor, you know, you're like a personal sensor, and then you adjust the controls, or you make changes to the visuals in order to, in order to have your personal reaction to the music. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>Yeah. That's, that's completely right indeed. I started out doing my first performances with, Robert Heer the exact year. I don't even know, I think it's 2009 that I did my first gig with him when I started doing this with, Robert Heer. We just coupled everything together, and there's a tendency to think that, things are, are perhaps beautiful, because they show off all these possibilities that you have within the program world, and it's kind of fascinating. And you can make a beautiful machine that's, that functions in a way that's, you know, can, can make a spec, specifically a program, or somebody who's fascinated by, you know, computers, very happy. But, that's something different from a beauty that one can see by just blankly, you know, experiencing the whole, the whole audio visual, combination. Basically, what I, what I, noticed was that it became boring, when I was, doing a couple of these gigs with Robert Heer. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>Every bass drum was having a similar reaction. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and some, and I was trying to make these reactions as nice as possible, but there was something impersonal in, in how the visuals were reacting to the music. And what I really like about, in music very much, and also within visuals in in art, is that things have their specific reason for being there, that a thing is not just there because, you know, this loop got triggered some time ago, so that's why we're hearing this beat in exactly <span style="color:red" data-ts="341.285" data-end_ts="341.445" title="341.285" id=c_"341.285">__the__</span> same way again. I like it when everything feels alive, just like every moment in time is a unique moment. I also want every moment within musical time to be, to be unique. Obviously, there's many also, how do you call it? There's many exceptions to that rule. Like sometimes it's precisely a cool thing about music that it has a very machine-like repetitive structure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>Right. But I'm <span style="color:red" data-ts="366.845" data-end_ts="366.925" title="366.845" id=c_"366.845">__now__</span> just describing in general was what I, when I, like, when I create stuff, I like to go the other direction where things, become very highly unique for that specific moment. And, that's also just something that I discovered through time in seeing, okay, I find this quite boring, what's happening right now. So slowly I toned down the whole automatic <span style="color:red" data-ts="388.895" data-end_ts="389.245" title="388.895" id=c_"388.895">__media__</span> triggering and audio analysis to the point where I basically decided, okay, I'm not gonna use this at all anymore. I actually wanna stop using this, crutch to lean on and just go into the more scary, domain of, you know, myself being real time, very active, responding to everything at <span style="color:red" data-ts="411.445" data-end_ts="411.565" title="411.445" id=c_"411.445">__a__</span> point and, even, you know, rhythmical stuff, et cetera. I need to be very honored to make it somehow, you know, connect with the, with the music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That makes a lot of sense. You know what it, the way you talk about it reminds me of like, how, how you would approach poetry as an artwork. Right. Probably the worst, worst way to consider poetry is to look at each word and think about the meaning of each word. And Yeah. And maybe a, <span style="color:red" data-ts="442.165" data-end_ts="442.285" title="442.165" id=c_"442.165">__a__</span> still a poor way of, of experiencing poetry is like saying, Ooh, how do the rhymes light up? And, and yeah. Do the rhymes trigger, you know, rhythms for me where really the best way to experience poetry is to kind of float over the top of it and absorb the meaning, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>Yeah. Yeah. I think that's, that's actually a very, very nice analogy you make there, Andy. The of course, also within the poetry in the end, of course, the rhythm stays important, and all these specific words do, do remain important. But I guess that even within the, within the creation, you might, you might find even the best words by not being completely, zooming into the small detail of that specific word. Some point the world will flow into place, and they become each, they become better as a whole, and also even each individual one, gets a deeper meaning. I think that's definitely what's happening within, within my visuals also, as I let go of these, more simple, direct connections, I still see lots of connections, but they seem to have so many more, layers and so many more different multi interpretable, connections also with the music. Right. And, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="517.165" data-end_ts="517.365" title="517.165" id=c_"517.165">__that__</span> of course, also, what what also still remains is that it is cool to still have that option of, having things being completely audio reactive or <span style="color:red" data-ts="525.925" data-end_ts="526.245" title="525.925" id=c_"525.925">__media__</span> reactive, but, to use that as a tool that you can consciously apply when you feel that it's needed. So not to use as a crutch that you can, that you, that you then become dependent on, but just to have it as another tool in your toolkits and apply it wisely. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That makes, that's, that makes a lot of sense. Now, one of the things is, over the course of that discussion, you really kind of focused on the concept of beauty. And I, I tend to think of beauty, you know, there's sort of things that as a culture we can kind of embrace as beautiful, but there's also a sense to which beauty is kind of an individual expression. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>Sure. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And it often comes from, you know, an individual's background. One of the things I like doing in my podcast is kind of finding out a little bit about people's paths, how they got to be artists, and how that's informed the work that they're doing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What, how did you get to where you are? What was your, what is your starting story and how did you find yourself becoming a audio visual artist? I mean, I, you know, very few people when they're four years old, you know, when mom and dad say, Hey, what do you want to be when you grow up? Say, I want to be an audio visual artist. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm, I'm curious what is, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>Especially in 1984, I think that was, that was specifically rare. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Yeah. There was no such thing. So, I'm curious, what was your track? What is your approach to, to the art? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>Yeah. Well, to, to some degree. I guess I could say that it's also, <span style="color:red" data-ts="627.075" data-end_ts="627.365" title="627.075" id=c_"627.075">__yeah__</span>, I was gonna say that it's a mystery, but no, it's not that much of a mystery of how I got to, to where I am. It's just unexpected. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I am now finding myself, yeah. Finding myself where I am. And, and I'm honestly, surprised of course, one can be surprised 24 7. So I, I'm also accustomed to, to the life and <span style="color:red" data-ts="649.005" data-end_ts="649.125" title="649.005" id=c_"649.005">__the__</span> job that I have, but still, it's, I would not have expected myself to, to end up here. And also until quite late, within my whole development, I, I still never suspected myself, you know, to ever become an artist, even in any, but yeah, I, I'll just start chronologically and start, you know, sketching the, the bricks that were stacked one on top of each other that at some point made this old thing happen. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>When I was a child, when I was, five years old, we went to Saudi Arabia. That was in 1985, I believe, with our family. We went to Saudi Arabia, where I had some advantages and some disadvantages. The disadvantage of living in Saudi Arabia was that I did not have many friends there because we were in a sort close community, for, foreigners, which was actually literally shield off with a wall, so that the bad guys couldn't come in and, you know, the, the walls had a gate in them, and the gate was guarded by people with, you know, big guns, right? To keep the foreigners in Saudi Arabia safe. And within those, those walls, there weren't many kids that I could really interact with, nicely. Fortunately, I had a, I had a brother, so that I didn't become totally socially awkward, even though I did become a little bit during that, time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>So there was, there was that, that boredom, a little bit of social, how do you call it, exclusion. There was a very strong heat during the daytime, which made it very difficult to even go and play outside during the daytime, only towards the evening that I become an option. And my mother was home teaching us, so, how do you call it? Homeschooling? Yeah, homeschooling, right? My mother homeschooled us, and that meant that, my brother and I could, learn things at our tempo. We could take more time where we needed, but it could also, take less time where we didn't need so much time, which meant that, after half year, every year, our, our, material for that's <span style="color:red" data-ts="774.285" data-end_ts="774.365" title="774.285" id=c_"774.285">__a__</span> year was, you know, we, we'd went through it. So there was half year of school and a half year of free time, so there was half year of free time, not many friends, the afternoons, you basically had to stay inside. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>And on top of that, we had a computer. So, yeah, that's where, where I started really, getting into that computer and seeing at some point by coincidences, that if you give the computer certain commands, they play little notes, or they give a little line of text back. My mother saw my interest in the, in these things, and then she, during a holiday in the Netherlands, she bought a computer book where I could just type over some code and stuff would happen. And from there on, I got into the whole programming thing. I was definitely not in any way like a kid genius, and I didn't do anything spectacular there, but it just really introduced my mind to the way that a computer, thinks, basically the very strict, logic how quickly also it can run through a whole bunch of lines of codes to make a little, little very simple pixelated puppets, cratic kick, those things, <laugh> that just made, my mind a little bit more fertile. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>When we then came back to the Netherlands, when I was 10 years old, there was no, that I didn't program anymore. I, also then, wasn't really thinking of that so much as, as a thing, you know, that that was inherent to me or anything. So, programming was out <span style="color:red" data-ts="868.645" data-end_ts="868.765" title="868.645" id=c_"868.645">__of__</span> the picture in high school. I had a strong interest in both drawing and in music. And, unfortunately, the, the rules were that I couldn't choose both in my curriculum, because that <span style="color:red" data-ts="882.045" data-end_ts="882.165" title="882.045" id=c_"882.045">__will__</span> be too much of a <span style="color:red" data-ts="883.325" data-end_ts="883.605" title="883.325" id=c_"883.325">__<inaudible>__</span>, as Dutch people would call it. Too much of a fun, fun based, thing. <laugh>, you, you, <span style="color:red" data-ts="890.005" data-end_ts="890.165" title="890.005" id=c_"890.005">__cause__</span> obviously, both music and drawing aren't serious things, that <span style="color:red" data-ts="894.685" data-end_ts="894.725" title="894.685" id=c_"894.685">__<crosstalk>__</span> Right. It's not painful enough. Right, exactly. It's not enough pain. <span style="color:red" data-ts="897.485" data-end_ts="897.525" title="897.485" id=c_"897.485">__<laugh>__</span>. Exactly. That's it. That's that. That's it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>Indeed. Yeah. Yeah. I guess a vegetable also isn't really a vegetable if it tastes good, right? Yeah. So, so I chose, drawing. I throw, I chose drawing and the, arts history. And then, after that, I, did architecture for a half year. Didn't really like that. Then I did psychology, for, two and a half years, kind of like that. But I noticed in the meantime that I was also getting too addicted to making music, on a computer with, <span style="color:red" data-ts="932.395" data-end_ts="932.685" title="932.395" id=c_"932.395">__also__</span> tracker based, programs. So then I decided, you know what? I actually need to, try and really give this go, especially because I got, one specific boost of confidence by John Peele at one point, playing one of my tracks on BBC radio. And, yeah, that was like kind of a big shock for me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>All of a sudden I realized, Hey, maybe this is something that I can actually do. Before this time, I'd never really taken, the thought of artistic career in any way, either musically or, you know, in painting or anything. I'd never taken that really seriously, just because I thought that I was not the kind of person that one needs to be to be a true artist. I think I had a very romantic idea, <span style="color:red" data-ts="977.905" data-end_ts="978.125" title="977.905" id=c_"977.905">__of__</span>, of, of what an artist is. And I <span style="color:red" data-ts="981.315" data-end_ts="981.805" title="981.315" id=c_"981.315">__believe__</span> that's an artist would be somebody who truly suffers the moment that they stop creating somebody who, who lives and sleeps for their art, who, is full of passion for, for what they do. And I was just a guy who liked making nice stuff and didn't have this, this strong feeling that I thought that, that a true artist would need. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>So, it was only after I got this <span style="color:red" data-ts="1008.525" data-end_ts="1008.725" title="1008.525" id=c_"1008.525">__vote__</span> of confidence, basically from John Peel, that I realized this doesn't just happen to anyone. Perhaps, perhaps there is something there that's, I just didn't even recognize myself. 'cause perhaps my view of an artist was a little bit too skewed. Maybe an artist can just be, you know, a person just like myself. Sure. So, yeah. So then I applied to the School of Music and Technology in, <inaudible> in the Netherlands, got accepted. And that was the first study that I finally managed to bring to a successful end. And during that study, I managed to figure out that this whole, you know, choice between music and, visual art that I was forced to make in the high, in the high school, that that wasn't really a choice that I needed to make anymore, because I learned about Max MSP during the study, and I learned about jitter within Max MSP. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>So basically, what I learned at this school was that with the same programming language that they were teaching me to create music with, I could also use that same programming language to create visuals with. And the points that I really started seeing how easy that was, and how accessible this role has become for me. Also, with some thanks to my previous programming knowledge that I had learned as a child, I all of a sudden see, so that there's this huge world that opened up for me. And that huge world at the beginning was just represented with a little sign notes doing 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Woo, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>And a little, simple cube, rotating around axis at different speeds with the changing frequency of that sign wave. But that was it. But I did realize that <laugh>, where, where this could go, like, computers were only gonna get faster if I was gonna put my attention <span style="color:red" data-ts="1120.195" data-end_ts="1120.485" title="1120.195" id=c_"1120.195">__into__</span> this. And then I would only get better in, you know, manipulating this. And I had images of the video clip of Guns <span style="color:red" data-ts="1128.995" data-end_ts="1129.285" title="1128.995" id=c_"1128.995">__Goff__</span>, which was on a video clip that's Alexander Rutherford made for Au Attacker, which had a three-dimensional object that was morphing all kinds of really exciting, weird ways to au attacker's music. I had little, you know, flashes of that in my mind, and I saw this can be made in real time, perhaps, you know, I can, I can at least explore, which doors will get opened if I try and move in that general direction. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>Right. From that, moment on, I was experimenting a lot with audio visual connections and getting very interested also in what happened within my brain as I was combining, the creation of music with the creation of visuals, especially if I have both of them in real time. You know, if I real time just jam and start editing within Ableton Live, for instance, and at the same time in real time, I see some visual also moving along, then at some point automatically I find myself adapting the music to what I'm seeing. And that's not, and then I'm not speaking of making a compromise, and speaking of, getting some inspiration. Yes. It, it gives <span style="color:red" data-ts="1200.445" data-end_ts="1200.645" title="1200.445" id=c_"1200.445">__some__</span> inspiration. And I guess that also <span style="color:red" data-ts="1202.325" data-end_ts="1202.445" title="1202.325" id=c_"1202.325">__a__</span>, a nice analogy would be to say, when a guitar player and a drummer work together, it's not like that the drummer compromises they're playing by actually paying attention to the guitar player or the other way around. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>Right? Right. That's, that's the same thing. Both are just, different, let's say channels of sound, which are also being perceived within the brain as different channels of sound. You know, one can say, of course, they all enter through the ear, but in the end, what matters is what happens in the brain. The brain hears, the drums and the brain hears the guitar. They are perceived as different entities, but combined, they make, combined, you know, emotions and combined experience. And the same can also be said for, what comes in through the eyes and what comes in through the years. Yes, these are two physically different entrances, but still the end result, it still all ends up in that same big, mysterious, weird, you know, pool of our consciousness. Right. Where it becomes this combined experience. Again, that also makes me believe that visuals are just as much music as music, can be well <span style="color:red" data-ts="1266.085" data-end_ts="1266.445" title="1266.085" id=c_"1266.085">__visual__</span> are not by definition just as much music as music can be, but they can be approached in such a way that they do become part of the music. And that's basically what's, my whole work has been about since then. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="1279.405" data-end_ts="1279.645" title="1279.405" id=c_"1279.405">__yeah__</span>, just different variations, of that general principle. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Very interesting. Very interesting. Now, a a couple of questions 'cause boy, I mean, just the, that story just has a lot of really interesting twists and turns. First of all, the track that John Peele played, it was clear that that was a real seminal moment for you. That was a point at which, yeah. Which, like, you came to a crossroads in life and decided, well, I can go this way, that I would love to go. Yeah. How did, how did John Peele ever trip across your track? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1315.345" data-end_ts="1315.565" title="1315.345" id=c_"1315.345">__Huh__</span>? Yeah, John Peele tripped across my track, because, some longer time ago, I was playing guitar in a really weird band called, Tom Revolver in the Netherlands. And we did a gig at, I even forgot where we had that gig. It might have been in Reda, who knows. At the same gig, there was another band called the Nazis from Mars. These people, the Nazis from Mars, had apparently, published some, tracks on this label called Irritant Records. And, I, I stayed in contact with them. They heard, some of the music that I was working on, 'cause they were interested. Then <span style="color:red" data-ts="1356.765" data-end_ts="1356.885" title="1356.765" id=c_"1356.765">__they__</span> said, oh, wait, you should actually resend this to our label ton records. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, the, this guy Andy, I forgot his last name, Andy, something from Ton Records. He really likes, one tracker that I, that I gave him. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>So he put that on a, how do you call it? <span style="color:red" data-ts="1373.925" data-end_ts="1374.045" title="1373.925" id=c_"1373.925">__A__</span> compilation album, this compilation album. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1377.035" data-end_ts="1377.325" title="1377.035" id=c_"1377.035">__Then__</span> just, you know, made the rounds <span style="color:red" data-ts="1379.365" data-end_ts="1379.645" title="1379.365" id=c_"1379.365">__ears__</span> and records was slightly more known, was slightly more known, more known entity than I, myself was. 'cause I was completely unknown. Right. And then John Peel somehow being interested in weird and interesting underground music, he stumbled across, upon that album and chose specifically my track to, to play. And then this Andy from Arizona Records, wrote me in a very enthusiastic email. John Peel just played <span style="color:red" data-ts="1403.125" data-end_ts="1403.245" title="1403.125" id=c_"1403.125">__the__</span> track of BBC Radio <laugh>. Yeah. And that kind of hit me. That's, I first, I just knew, okay, I am happy. This is, this is great. But then also shortly after, what does this mean? This, this has to mean something, right. This is just gonna be this weird little blip on, on my life, or, or do I need to continue this further? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>And then I, I realized, yeah, basically it took me some time after that to, to realize that if I were not going to pursue this path, that I was making it very, very likely, that I would become miserable and regretful later in life. Well, not necessarily, I probably, you know, would've found a way to, you know, deal with stuff and perhaps become very happy in a different way. But at that point, I just had this huge fear that if I would not pursue this right now, I would just always have this question in my mind. What if I would've actually tried and, you know, pursue this? So at some point it just became like the rational decision to just pursue this and rather <span style="color:red" data-ts="1470.035" data-end_ts="1470.325" title="1470.035" id=c_"1470.035">__feel__</span>, and then know that I, I feel rather that, than not try. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Now, at the time you were using, you were using tracking tools to do your <span style="color:red" data-ts="1479.825" data-end_ts="1480.045" title="1479.825" id=c_"1479.825">__me__</span> music making, huh? Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b><affirmative>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I have tried a couple of times to just play with a tracker, and it breaks my brain. It is such a data <span style="color:red" data-ts="1491.785" data-end_ts="1492.205" title="1491.785" id=c_"1491.785">__driven__</span>, you know, it feels like, it feels like you're dealing with data rather than dealing with music a lot of the time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>Yep. Yep. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>How, what was it about the tracker that worked for you? What was the thing that made that the right tool for you to express yourself? Because even back then, you would've had access to a lot of different kinds of sequencers and, you know, samplers or whatever. What is it about the Tracker that really was the thing that was the tool that worked for you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>That question, has a very disappointing answer. I'm afraid. <laugh>, which <laugh>, also an answer that will not fit this, romanticized <span style="color:red" data-ts="1533.955" data-end_ts="1534.245" title="1533.955" id=c_"1533.955">__idea__</span> of the artist who, you know, always follows the path of his, known destiny. You know, and everything is meant to happen in a specific way, and he feels whatever. Simply that's just some guys in my high school were using that to make silly songs. And I thought, that's cool. I'm <span style="color:red" data-ts="1554.125" data-end_ts="1554.365" title="1554.125" id=c_"1554.125">__gonna__</span> just join them and, and, and, making some, silly songs. And I just, it was basically just availability that, drew me to, to the Striker program. I was completely unaware of the other options. I was also unaware of myself having any type of serious, you know, musical, ambition or anything. Sure. So it was just fooling around with, with the tracker that's, yeah. It was just fooling around by s that just kept me there until at some later point in life, I, I really discovered, oh, if I'm gonna take this seriously, then I might as well just see what's, for instance, this Ableton Live thing is all about. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. Or 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>Fruit Loops, actually. Fruit Loops, I definitely need to mention Fruity Loops. 'cause that's an awesome program also. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Fruity Loops too. Kind of, it lives in a world almost halfway between a tracker and like more typical DAW software. It seems to still have a little of that tracker nature to it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>The tracker, well, maybe it's, it does have, I didn't even, recognize that as such. 'cause I came just purely from a world of trackers, Uhhuh <affirmative>. So if anything about <span style="color:red" data-ts="1620.965" data-end_ts="1621.165" title="1620.965" id=c_"1620.965">__Fruit__</span> Loops <span style="color:red" data-ts="1621.485" data-end_ts="1621.685" title="1621.485" id=c_"1621.485">__will__</span> be through a track, like I won't even be, be noticing that, just in the same way that a fish won't know what water is, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Sure. Right. Yeah. I get it. So now, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1631.785" data-end_ts="1632.005" title="1631.785" id=c_"1631.785">__you__</span>, when you went to to school, you, you kind of had this interesting path through school, but you ended up landing in, this music and tech kind of environment. And I'm curious, because it seems like the Netherlands more than almost any other place, the Netherlands has a long history of interweaving technology and, and music. Right. You know, going back to, to the, the days of tape music and stuff like that, and they're integral part of in that. But, you know, just the variety of different university based environments that where you can experience the intersection of art and technology. It seems like the Netherlands has always been at the forefront and, and has a real hit rich history in that. What, what do you think it is about the Netherlands that does that? And do you feel like that was actually, that was something that was on your radar that the availability of that made it possible for you to take this approach? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>Honestly, I, I wouldn't be able to pinpoint, myself, what is it within an Netherlands that's, that's, that it's such a, first <span style="color:red" data-ts="1709.025" data-end_ts="1709.245" title="1709.025" id=c_"1709.025">__all__</span> ground for, for these arts to, to emerge. I actually don't know. I mean, sure, there's, I mean, money is a, is a big issue. And the fact that there's, that, well, especially back in those days, I, for instance, felt that I could go and do such a weird thing like, music and, technology, partially because I felt perhaps even falsely, secure about my future, that I thought, well, I'm living in, in this kinda like really lucky privileged country anyway. There's always gonna be some way for me to, to earn my money even if I completely <span style="color:red" data-ts="1745.715" data-end_ts="1746.005" title="1745.715" id=c_"1745.715">__fail__</span> in this, domain. So I guess that for me personally, was just a reason why I thought that I could go in there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>But, you know, there's, there's also, I guess the, the most internet usage per, person on average, you know, in the Netherlands, there's, there's different ways in which the Netherlands are very technology based. And honestly, I can't really, can't really explain that. I can say though that it definitely, as I was, you know, slowly being introduced to this whole world, also while studying, music and technology, that I was very much picking the fruits of that I was going to festivals like two today's art and, sonic acts. I guess that somehow subconsciously I, assumed that this was things which were happening very regularly all over the western world. I had, I didn't have a specific ID that I was in a country where I was specifically lucky to be living there. Yeah. But I definitely picked the fruits. I can very clearly remember, going to Sonic Acts, I don't know which year, it might have been like 2007, 2006. And, being blown away by the fact that, such a huge stage was given to people making drone music and just incredible physical impact that it had on me. I was really tripping balls purely on the music. It was, it was crazy. And I was, that was very, very inspiring. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, I can imagine. I mean, you know, from thousands of miles away, the sonic Axis is very influential just because of, you know, the people that they brought to the forefront and the way that they sort of like <span style="color:red" data-ts="1847.585" data-end_ts="1847.805" title="1847.585" id=c_"1847.585">__pre__</span> presented the information. You know, it's, that's, that in particular is, is an example of something where its impact is extraordinary and like historical Mm-Hmm. So that must have been in incredible to be, you know, at the stage, that that must be wild. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>For your personal practice, what are the things I'm always interested in talking to people. I'm, I'm interested when I talk to people who, are comfortable talking about sort of like programming and software creation, as well as having an artistic vision, because that's yet another place where a balancing act has to occur. You know, I'm, I'm fascinated by how people deal with balance, with balance, right. And, when you're doing both programming and, and artistic stuff, it's always interesting to me to talk to people who <span style="color:red" data-ts="1905.345" data-end_ts="1905.565" title="1905.345" id=c_"1905.345">__bal__</span> who have to balance those two things, because each of those tends to be a very consuming effort. You know, if you're doing software work, you have a tendency to like go into the code hole and Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And you focus on stuff and you're like deep into the algorithms, or you're trying to carry this map around in your head of all the subroutines and all the places where you're calling things. And then, when you get into the art thing, you tend to like really dive into, you know, I'm trying to express this thing and it's not quite working out Right. And I need to, you know, what color space do I need to work in, or what sonic space, and you tend to go down the, the art hole, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I am curious, how do you balance having to jump between two different holes, you know? Yeah. How do you, how do you manage that balance? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>Yeah. I, I think you, you described all of that, very accurately. I completely agree with, <laugh> with everything you just said. And the balancing is very difficult. And honestly, not even something that I would say that I'm good at. I mean, I do manage to get results, every time, so I'm not completely failing at it. But I do often get myself in, panic, basically <laugh>, by, by, by not being as good in that as I would like to. I tend to, really go down, the, the programming hole. I guess somehow the programming hole is a hole that's more easy to, to get lost in, also <span style="color:red" data-ts="2007.965" data-end_ts="2008.125" title="2007.965" id=c_"2007.965">__because__</span> it's less scary, it's less personal. There's, less insecurity involved. The moment that you really just are applying logic, it's just a, a whole bunch of relatively simple steps. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>Often, sometimes it gets very complicated, but often it's just whole bunch of simple steps that all can just be stacked <span style="color:red" data-ts="2027.805" data-end_ts="2027.845" title="2027.805" id=c_"2027.805">__in__</span> top of each other, and you're feeling that you're making progress. It's that sense rewarding. And that can be thing <span style="color:red" data-ts="2033.845" data-end_ts="2034.005" title="2033.845" id=c_"2033.845">__they__</span> should do until, eternity. And then to make that switch to, actually creatively using it, yeah. That is, that is a very difficult one, which in my case is very much, I guess forced upon me by deadlines, by deadlines, which I in turn also force upon myself. So in the end, it is my choice, but I always definitely need to have, deadlines of performances or, you know, exhibitions and all these kind of things in order to, get myself over that, over that hurdle, over that insecurity at some point, basically, I come to a point where I panic when it's really just not cool anymore, when I realize that I will definitely, disappoint everybody, you know, including myself, if I'm not gonna start working right now on the creative side, and then I get there, and then it's a lot of fun again. But there's always a lot of pain involved in making that switch from the programming side to, to the creative side. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. But I, I think that the kind of work you do and the environments where you do your work, I would think that it's, it's pretty hard to be insecure and still get the gig done. Right? So if you're doing a, if you're doing a gig with Tom York, or if you're doing a gig with Mono Lake, yeah, it's, you're working with some very self secure people, right. They don't, they may have insecurities, but they're not gonna express it in any particular way, <laugh>. And it would have to be a little intimidating to have, you know, to, to feel somewhat insecure and still have to show up and nail the gig. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>Yeah. That is, a thing though, that's, just about every artist has, and probably the artist, many artists who really seem un Yeah. Who really seem like they don't have any problems with, with self security, are just the ones who, out of an extreme insecurity, have built up an extremely carefully thought out mask. You know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2159.745" data-end_ts="2159.965" title="2159.745" id=c_"2159.745">__the__</span>, the people are paradoxes, in these, in these ways. Sure. This, I think it's, very true that artists are hotbeds of neurosis and, insecurities completely. And, and, and so yeah, I definitely have. But yeah, there you are, right? In this sense that when I, go on stage, with a Tom York, or a mono <span style="color:red" data-ts="2185.725" data-end_ts="2185.965" title="2185.725" id=c_"2185.725">__lake__</span> for the very, very first time, that's, that's an extremely nerve wracking experience. And, is, yeah. I can specifically remember very clearly now the first time that I was on stage with Tom York, that it's felt as if, I was approaching a, black hole, where all laws of physics and nature would break down. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>There's no way of knowing what would happen, what would happen there. I could also not think, of any future beyond that point <laugh>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2218.755" data-end_ts="2219.045" title="2218.755" id=c_"2218.755">__like__</span>, I have no idea how this is ever supposed to happen. And obviously also then there's these other aspects of the impostor syndrome thinking, wait, who am I again? Why? How come that somebody made a weird mistake here, <laugh>. Yeah. But then I guess, I, I do, also have, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2239.315" data-end_ts="2239.605" title="2239.315" id=c_"2239.315">__apps__</span> not like a super effective antidote against the insecurity, but, there are some things which I do know, what I do know is that, if I think that it's people that I'm performing with are as cool as I think they are, then perhaps their choice for me may mean something, you know, <laugh> then, even though I'm not sure about it, they also chose me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>So we are in <span style="color:red" data-ts="2265.885" data-end_ts="2265.925" title="2265.885" id=c_"2265.885">__this__</span> together anyway in some sense. Right, right. And, and also, I am aware of imposter syndrome being a very common thing. So I also know, even though it feels like I'm in the most unique, weird, and insecure position we all get here, at some point or the other. So, I do try to sometimes, realize that, I guess I'm now, thinking a little bit about what I said about this idea of the artist being sort of like ideal creature. Everybody, I think it's, it's nice to realize that everybody deep down feels just as fumbling, mumbling, idiotic as you yourself do, this is a very common thing with everybody. And that's also why I think that, the supremely self, self <span style="color:red" data-ts="2310.685" data-end_ts="2311.085" title="2310.685" id=c_"2310.685">__secure__</span>, artists also doesn't really exist. There. The, the only thing that does happen with experience, with, you know, all these things is that, at some point I do realize that, okay, not all of my life now depends on this gig going, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>Like even with somebody, like, Tom York, which, you know, still, that's, that's, that's a weird experience. But I'm also getting kind of used to, to it, right? <span style="color:red" data-ts="2338.105" data-end_ts="2338.325" title="2338.105" id=c_"2338.105">__And__</span> that's, at some point I know, okay, even if my computer crashes and burns, or I do the iest weirdest mistake ever here, life will continue. Also, I have already proved some things in my life. So not everything's gonna hinge on this. And then still the nerves come up and it's all very, very exciting, and you really pray to all the gods that everything will go fine. But, you know, it's, it becomes a little bit more, you, you can re relativize. Is that the words you can make? Basically just put a little more in perspective through the rest of your life. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Now, one of the things I'm curious about <span style="color:red" data-ts="2373.585" data-end_ts="2373.805" title="2373.585" id=c_"2373.585">__you__</span>, you said that you sort of like base everything that you do off of this <span style="color:red" data-ts="2378.145" data-end_ts="2378.365" title="2378.145" id=c_"2378.145">__ome__</span> software that you've developed. Yeah. Is that, has this been something that you've been working on for a long time? So like, is this what you, is this, were you using kind of early versions of this structure, like when you first started working with Robert Heka and, and Mono Lake? <span style="color:red" data-ts="2396.285" data-end_ts="2396.525" title="2396.285" id=c_"2396.285">__Yeah__</span>. And so this is something you've been building up over the last almost decade, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>Which is kind of crazy, but Yes, that is true. Yeah. I, started this same, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2410.065" data-end_ts="2410.285" title="2410.065" id=c_"2410.065">__the__</span> same program that I'm still using. I started at, I think, halfway, let's say, I think beginning of 2008 approximately is when I started doing it. It was the projects also with which I, finished school and it was a three dimensional, audiovisual sequencer. And actually, saying that I was working on an audiovisual sequencer is kind of like a totology, if that's an English word, uhhuh, basically any sequencer except maybe if there's one specifically designed for blind people. But normally any sequencer already is an audio visual sequencer. You see <span style="color:red" data-ts="2447.655" data-end_ts="2447.875" title="2447.655" id=c_"2447.655">__it__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2447.935" data-end_ts="2448.155" title="2447.935" id=c_"2447.935">__on__</span> live and you hear it, and the visuals are meant to inform what things are gonna sound like. That's what I was also creating, for myself. But then I was <span style="color:red" data-ts="2456.595" data-end_ts="2456.715" title="2456.595" id=c_"2456.595">__a__</span> 3D audiovisual, sequencer where I could fly through music. And, the melody that you would hear would depend on the path that I take within 3D space. Sure, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That makes sense. Yeah. Now, you know, we talked before about how, you know, one of the things that you did was you started off doing very tightly attached to like, audio reactive, and you eventually remove that, seeing that as a crutch, and then you have it as tooling that you can use, but you're not locked to it. Mm-hmm. Right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But, your software having been with you for 10 years, that's gotta be like, that has to have become almost like your instrument. And while not a crutch, it probably Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> is one of those areas of solitude, so that when you do end up in a stressful position, you're at least saying, well, at least I know this tool. I know this instrument really well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>Yeah. And there was also a time, when I had, only had experience performing with, Robert Hanker, AKA Mono <span style="color:red" data-ts="2524.685" data-end_ts="2524.965" title="2524.685" id=c_"2524.685">__Lake__</span>, traveling through virtual 3D visual worlds, which <span style="color:red" data-ts="2529.315" data-end_ts="2529.605" title="2529.315" id=c_"2529.315">__were__</span>, which were reacting to his music. When I had only had that experience, I also wasn't quite convinced of my own, you know, worth or value as, as an artist. I just knew that I'd made this, fancy program that, was able to impress people, but it was not quite clear whether this impressing people was because of the, you know, purely artistic merits or because of the fact that it is, considered impressive to make this whole world, just by yourself and that it worked. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2560.565" data-end_ts="2560.805" title="2560.565" id=c_"2560.565">__Yeah__</span>, of course, people, yeah. Yeah. That, that <span style="color:red" data-ts="2562.405" data-end_ts="2562.565" title="2562.405" id=c_"2562.405">__had__</span> actually worked, and I was created by one person. I mean, it's, it doesn't cause me much, trouble to understand how that's, how that's, impressive from a technical viewpoint. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>But then it was actually really interesting that when I, started working with Tom York, that he asked me, well, I, I, at one point introduced, my assistant to him. He saw this, 3D stuff. And, shortly after when I made the first video for him, he asked, what if you just try and do everything in 2D? Which for me sounded almost like, what if you try and do what you do without it being what you do? It just felt like, wait, what? <laugh> Right. But, but obviously he saw something there, which, which I myself had, failed to see that obviously there's way more than just traveling through, virtual 3D environments. Right? If you have a, a surface, basically a rectangle, that the usual screen is, you can use this to just compose in colors, use the relative proportions within that surface, in, in a way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>I'd never done that before in such a conscious way. And as I was, doing that more and more, and then also later on, I started applying other types of techniques, which are more explicitly two DI, at some <span style="color:red" data-ts="2636.765" data-end_ts="2636.885" title="2636.765" id=c_"2636.765">__point__</span>, recognized that I was making a whole different type of imagery than ever before. And still I kind of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2644.065" data-end_ts="2644.285" title="2644.065" id=c_"2644.065">__did__</span> it. I still thought, Hey, actually, this, this is kind of beautiful, which is what is now happening. And that was also the point where I realized that I could, I might as well have written this whole parts of the, of the visuals creation in a completely separate program in a very different way. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2659.905" data-end_ts="2660.125" title="2659.905" id=c_"2659.905">__And__</span> similar stuff still would've come out. And then I realized that, oh, basically it's my brain. It's my, it's your voice. Yeah. <laugh>. It's, it's my voice that speaks through, these different things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>And so I do, I put everything together within one program. 'cause it makes it very easy for me to combine all the different techniques in all kind of different ways and switch from one, one <span style="color:red" data-ts="2681.125" data-end_ts="2681.285" title="2681.125" id=c_"2681.125">__mode__</span> to the other. It just makes a beautiful hub of all these things. But I could lose it, and I would be very, very, very, very sad, but I could still continue and do something completely different and still know that, my voice is still present within my own brain. So I'm actually very happy that I had that experience of, you know, having to go a totally different route and knowing that, I myself am actually <span style="color:red" data-ts="2706.625" data-end_ts="2706.845" title="2706.625" id=c_"2706.625">__all__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2706.845" data-end_ts="2707.045" title="2706.845" id=c_"2706.845">__one__</span> calls an artist. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, that's actually interesting because one of the things I was gonna ask is when you have a, you know, this software that you've developed that becomes your instrument, unlike someone for whom Ableton Live is their instrument, if you're writing your own thing, you, you end up with this conundrum at some point, which is like, I feel the need to change, or I feel the need to add something, but doing that is gonna break this thing. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2736.245" data-end_ts="2736.325" title="2736.245" id=c_"2736.245">__And__</span> in breaking it, what am I gonna lose? How am I gonna screw up my life? Right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, how am I gonna reveal the imposter that I am, by breaking my tool? Right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But it seems like you've become comfortable with the fact that your voice is going to end up coming out no matter what you do. That's, that's pretty cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>Yes, indeed. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You seem to be a lot, have a lot better introspection about your artistic life than an awful lot of people that I meet. Mm-Hmm. What? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. What do you think is causing that? I mean, as part of the things you said, you <span style="color:red" data-ts="2770.005" data-end_ts="2770.325" title="2770.005" id=c_"2770.005">__studied__</span> that, you said you studied a couple of years of psychology Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2773.885" data-end_ts="2773.925" title="2773.885" id=c_"2773.885">__I__</span> mean, how did that affect you? Or, or do you have like, some sort of personal zen-like practice that helps you understand yourself better, but you seem to be like, really, have a really healthy view of your own artistic self? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah, it's funny because, in, in many ways, I, I think that I don't have such a clear view of myself, but perhaps that is a sign of somebody being aware that there is so much to know about oneself. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2807.625" data-end_ts="2807.845" title="2807.625" id=c_"2807.625">__Did__</span>, did that make sense what I just said? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, it did. It did. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b><laugh>. Okay. The more you know, the more you know what you don't know, you know, that kind of, stuff Yeah. That, that cliche is what I'm talking about. Right. So, I'm, I'm also very aware, aware of having no clue who the hell I am, but I am very interested in doing some research in that indeed <laugh>. I don't think that necessarily my, study in psychology had such a huge influence. Well, I learned some pretty neat stuff. There was some really nice little ways of seeing how the brain works, also just biologically and how that whole material aspects of the biological nature of your brain can be translated into the, you know, very subjective experience that's, that one has within themselves. How all these different parts of the brain seem to be doing their own little thing and communicating in different ways. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>And, how you can sometimes also can feel that within a chits chatter within your own, mind. And also that you can have a whole wide array of different perspectives and opinions. Of course, what comes out of your mouth generally needs to have somewhat of a consistent line in order for people to understand you. But actually you are this whole bunch of, you know, things that all are just mashed together. And the, the, the most powerful of those things managed to, to, you know, come out through your mouth. But the other things are also still there. I might have completely different views, et cetera, et cetera. I find that whole thing super fascinating and I have no idea why exactly. Like, I'm gonna guess some part of that is just gonna be like genetics or something. Maybe also part of that is just, you know, my time in Saudi Arabia being quite, solitary and just reflecting on things and with not much more than myself, well, now doing my family justice <span style="color:red" data-ts="2912.675" data-end_ts="2913.165" title="2912.675" id=c_"2912.675">__because__</span> my family was also around. But, you know, still with yourself being such a Jewish part of your life, perhaps that also became, a reason of being just a little bit more reflective about these things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. The, the, the value of isolation sometimes, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I think it's more that whole general attitude that I already had, that attitude that also drove me to, towards studying psychology is the thing that's also present within my thinking about my artistic presence more than that, the psych than that the study of psychology, kickstarted that it was more just a symptom of a thing of an interest that I already, had developed way before. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2951.305" data-end_ts="2951.525" title="2951.305" id=c_"2951.305">__Wow__</span>. Very interesting. Yeah. So, I can't believe it, but we've burned through the time that, that we've set up. But, before you go, I want to ask the one obvious question. I mean, you, you've given us your backstory as well as kinda your present story. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. I'm curious about what you imagine your future story to look like. You know, what are the things that you're, you know, every artist and every technologist, I mean, on both sides, in both of these holes, one of the things that we're always doing is not only working on a thing that is now, but also thinking about and exploring what's gonna be the future. What are the things that you see around the corner for yourself? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>Hmm. It's funny, that I am not so much working on, yeah. On, on, on grand future visions. I think I actually never have, which is funny because, I am, because of the, the, the program that I made when I was 28, when I finished my studies, of musical technology, that program, you know, that's you, that, that became the thing that I'm now still working on. So, one could imagine that being, you know, this, this blueprint with a grant, ideas for a future, this is what I'm gonna develop into it, into, but that's never was the intent that that just kept on happening. It just kept on adding things and restructuring things in a way that it would be very fit for whatever kind of inspiration might come in the future. And I guess I'm still doing that in a way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>I am not very strongly working towards, future applications, but I do try and keep my programming flexible, open, and modular enough so that any type of future path that I might choose, can easily be, you know, addressed. Having said that, there are of course still some fantasies of, what the future might bring. Obviously, VR is, is a thing. Like there's no way for that not to be a thing that I would want to do, of course. Right. Even though there, there is one problem with the vr, which is that it's traps you in so strongly with vr, you can get <span style="color:red" data-ts="3081.845" data-end_ts="3081.965" title="3081.845" id=c_"3081.845">__a__</span> perception of this virtual world being all around you, and you're completely free to move in 360 degrees anywhere around you within that virtual world. At the same time, your physical body, gets all these things strapped, you know, strapped to itself, which just from a pure physical sensation is a thing that does the opposites of creating that openness. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>And that's something that I find a little bit, problematic there. I'm not saying that that's a reason for me to not want to engage because, you know, it's still also technology and I still wanna use it. But yeah, that's just where there's, there's some friction within, within my own attitudes towards, towards VR and I guess other things. For me just now, I'm very excited in producing, audio visual, solo works also together with, with a singer, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3132.835" data-end_ts="3133.125" title="3132.835" id=c_"3132.835">__Leia__</span> Fabricant, who will be creating in conjunction with, with my solo audio Visual Works. She'll also be part of these solo gigs. So therefore they're not really solo <laugh>, <laugh>, she'll be a part of those, by making audio visual loops. She'll be singing and making, making sounds, and images. And her voice will be recorded with a microphone while the image of her is going to be recorded, with a camera. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>And these audio visual loops will be placed in the virtual three-dimensional space. These loops can also be manipulated, in <span style="color:red" data-ts="3170.405" data-end_ts="3170.485" title="3170.405" id=c_"3170.405">__the__</span> audiovisual way, so her face can become stretched while her voice becomes weirdly pitched into other octaves, et cetera. I'm really looking forward to seeing how this live looping interaction thing, can be made to, to create a truly audio visual experience where sound and visuals are more tightly connected than I've ever done before. While at the same time within this, this performance, I'll have the option of making everything extremely psychedelic, explosive weird, because of all the experience that I've had in doing that with creating visuals for other people. Mm-Hmm. Yeah. I don't know if what I just now did was rambling or not, but this, that's <span style="color:red" data-ts="3215.805" data-end_ts="3215.925" title="3215.805" id=c_"3215.805">__this__</span>, this whole, audio visual thing where it's very timely connected and at the same time very other worldly. I'm very excited to explore that, more strongly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and and a lot of times when you, when you start getting into, into this world where the audio visual mix becomes so intertwined, it becomes really difficult to find words for it. Right. It's really difficult to put a definition on it when, because that interaction seems to defy, vocalization in a way. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>Yeah, indeed. I guess that's, it would perhaps less defy vocalization once it's become more of a known arts form. 'cause then the words appropriate for it would've been found. But it's especially <span style="color:red" data-ts="3260.765" data-end_ts="3260.925" title="3260.765" id=c_"3260.765">__five__</span> vocalization because it doesn't really exist so much. So you're trying to use words based on older concepts to describe something new, which is, I guess, can lead to some nice poetry, but it's difficult. Yeah. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, Tariq, that sounds really, exciting. Really fabulous. I'm anxious to get a chance to see some of, some of that work in action. Yeah. Again, we will, we can take a look at some of your work on your website, which is tar <span style="color:red" data-ts="3287.595" data-end_ts="3287.885" title="3287.595" id=c_"3287.595">__bari__</span> nl, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>Yes, indeed. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Other than that, I want to thank you so much for taking the time to have the chat. It was really fun. Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>Yeah, it was really fun. Indeed. All of these words came out of me, and you pull them out in a really nice way. So thank you. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thank, thank you so much and have a great rest of your day. All right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tarik: </b>Yeah, thanks, you too. 
</p>

I just want to again, reiterate my thanks to Bari. That was a fabulous chat and a really great insight into an amazing artist's mind. I want to thank you, the listeners for continuing to support me showing up every week and listening to this stuff, here at the NAMM Show. I met a number of you. I really want to thank you for the props of and just telling me to keep on doing it. 'cause that's what I want to do. Anyway, thank you and, enjoy the rest of your week. I'll see you next time <span style="color:red" data-ts="3353.085" data-end_ts="3353.325" title="3353.085" id=c_"3353.085">__round__</span>. Bye.
