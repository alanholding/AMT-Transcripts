<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, today I'm going to be interviewing a longtime friend of mine. He's a coworker and, with me at Cycling 74. He's also a collaborator on many musical projects. He and I have, recently released an album on, palace of Lights. And, additionally, we've done a lot of performing together. I find him one of the most fascinating people in my life. And so I'm really happy and excited to share, share. Gregory Taylor with you, the listeners. Hi, Gregory, how are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory Taylor: </b>Hi. No pressure, huh? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. No pressure at all. That's right. Well, it's, I I want to throw that out there because it is true. I, I, you seem to have such an encyclopedic knowledge of things, and I always learn something new every time we have a discussion, so there you go. Uhoh Uhoh. Well, as you probably know from this, podcast, one of the ways that we tend to start our conversations is by asking people to, give us a little bit of, their background. Tell us something about their background. And as you well know, sometimes it's, performance related or it's, it's where they went to school or it's, <span style="color:red" data-ts="89.36" data-end_ts="89.58" title="89.36" id=c_"89.36">__how__</span> mean their dad was to them. So, I'll let you kind of pick, but if you could kind of fill us in a little bit on how you got to be the person you are. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Well, the longer one lives, the longer that story gets, so I'll do what I can to compress it as much as possible. I think I'm one of those people that started out, pretty ordinary as a kid. I guess the only thing I can think of that really set me on the course, at a really young age to the person that I am now, is that, the public library when I was in seventh grade, moved all of the records up from the basement where you couldn't get at them to a giant rack of shelves along the wall of the library. That was the same year that I could take stuff out with my library card. So I started checking, records out of the library, and, for some reason that I will always be grateful for my mother and father suggested that if I was going to be bringing all these records home, then the smart thing to do would be to listen to them on the family's <span style="color:red" data-ts="153.8" data-end_ts="154.02" title="153.8" id=c_"153.8">__new__</span> set of headphones on our stereo. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>And so the earliest memory that explains the person that I am is that I'm one of those kids who grew up listening to all kinds of music that I could kind of randomly choose from with no adults around to tell me what was good or bad or interesting. And when I think back over all of the things that's happened, it's the foundation for my love of what we now call pornography site recordings. It's the origin of my interest in things like sound effects, unusual musics, and particularly in the case of my own life with, non-Western musics in general. That's the first time I got to hear that. My later education was, you know, pretty much normal high school stuff. I sort of goofed around and played in bands. When I was in college, I had a little trouble deciding what it was I wanted to do, and it sort of came down to choosing between degrees in literature and philosophy and the visual arts. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>And I wound up in the visual arts because, it was the least number of credits, that I needed to graduate. And, you know, money was tight. So, my only degree is in, is a b FFA in painting, which probably surprises most people now. After I left college, I, played in a bar band in North Carolina with one of my best friends and, wound up acquiring, you know, a bunch of instruments that you need to do to do that. And decided that at some point that although I really loved the people that I played with, I was playing music that, I don't know, I maybe wasn't all that great at it. I would probably burn with shame if I heard live recordings of my band now. But I was playing music in places I kind of wouldn't go for people I wouldn't necessarily hang out with. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>And it really bothered me because I was playing it with my, my best friends, but I just decided maybe it was time to do something else. And so, I kept a bunch of my gear, moved back up north and got a temp job working for, at Fermilab. Oh. I was cutting foil into three inch strips, actually, as it turned out. And I wound up going to their library, and since there wasn't any security in the place, <span style="color:red" data-ts="292" data-end_ts="292.22" title="292" id=c_"292">__the__</span>, they just let me check books out. And I kind of got in trouble for it later. But my boss decided if I was interested in reading about what I was doing, he'd give me a better job. And to make a long story short, one of the other things that kind of explains me, I think, in a pretty good way to people is that I'm one of those people who spent his entire working life doing kinds of work that are kind of, what do we say? Too tedious and boring for really smart people. <laugh> and too weird for regular people, <laugh>. So the idea of, of, you know, being a painter who worked at Fermi Lab and Bell Laboratories and the Center for the Theory Center for Simulation at COR Cornell University, those things don't make any sense unless you think of it that way. Right. And that is to say you kind of learn how to teach yourself. Sure. And, should I explain to them how I know David Z? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I don't know how you know David Zaccarelli actually, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>You actually don't. Okay. Well, so here's the deal. Many people ask me, many people mistakenly assume I must be one of the smartest kids in the room. And, because I worked for Cycling 74, and they always want to know how I got my job or how I met David. I married a woman who was getting her PhD in German and Dutch at Cornell University when I was working at Bell Laboratories. And, since I was in love and it was the right thing to do, I left my job at Bell Labs and I moved to Ithaca, New York, where getting a job was really difficult because the person that waited TAs for you at the coffee shop had a PhD in comparative Vietnamese literature. And I was just some geek generalist who did, evaluation of diagnostic, computer protocols at Bell Labs, which wasn't a very high <span style="color:red" data-ts="404.58" data-end_ts="404.82" title="404.58" id=c_"404.58">__rule__</span> skill. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Anyway, I finally did get a job, explaining computing to terrified tenured professors. Again, one of those jobs is too difficult for regular people and too tedious for smart people. <laugh>. While I was working there, I started doing live performance. I was kind of interested in doing, by this time I was kind of making and releasing cassette recordings, which we can talk about later if you want. But I started doing live gigs, and, part of the reason to do that was if you did gigs at some of the places in town, particularly the Cabbage Town Cafe, which was this great vegetarian place, is you had a choice of getting money for the gig, or like twice to three times as much credit at the cafe. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. So of course, since my wife's a grad student, we were, man, we were poor as church mice, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>So I thought, oh, this will be awesome. A couple of free meals, <laugh>. And there was this guy who came to my gigs. He was <span style="color:red" data-ts="463.24" data-end_ts="463.36" title="463.24" id=c_"463.24">__a__</span>, he was a college kid and, sorry, high school kid. His dad, I think, was a professor at, at Cornell, maybe an engineering guy or something. Anyway, he was, he played keyboards in a couple of local bands, and he was this like, really cool, happy, smiley guy, and you'd do these wacky ass gigs, and he'd come up to the end and he'd say, wow, that was really neat. And he was just like, he was a great guy. I, I always loved to see him. And, so the time came that my wife Defen, you know, was getting ready to finish her PhD and she got a job teaching at the University of Wisconsin. And so it was time to have like goodbye gigs because I was gonna move, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>And we did my last goodbye gig. And, and he came to my gig and, you know, we were, he was the kind of guy he'd like, help you load stuff into the car when you were done and things like that. And he was saying, well, and I said, you know, gosh, Doug, I'm really gonna miss you because it just seems like you're always at my gigs and I look out in the audience and I see you there, and it just makes me happy and it's gonna be weird to ever perform again and not see you. And he said, oh man, don't worry. I'm gonna move to California. I got a job working for a software company. And, and here's the part of the story that's kind of a little weird. I was playing in the Golan Ensemble at Cornell, and one of the things I was really interested in doing was using those tuning systems to do the kind of a electronic music that I did. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>So I had a friend who worked at Texas Instruments in, Texas, who disassembled ROMs for a living. That was his job. And we got to talking about it, and I said, so if you could disassemble the tuning ROM on the old dx, so this is not the DX 70 twos, the very first ones mm-hmm. <affirmative>, could you burn me a new chip that would give me my, the scale on the Cornell University Golon? And he thought about it for a while and he said, well, yeah, sure, send me the chips. So I dug it outta my DX seven, stuck it in the mail to him, and I don't know, month and a half <span style="color:red" data-ts="584.89" data-end_ts="585.18" title="584.89" id=c_"584.89">__back__</span>, back, this thing came back and he said, put this in, turn it on. And lo and behold, it played my thing. So I was doing gigs in non-Western tunings, which was kind of odd for that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>So anyway, we're talking about this thing, and I said, it's gonna be, and he said, well, gosh, and not only am I going to California, but there's gonna be a new DX seven coming out, and you're gonna be able to tune it. Youre yourself, you won't have to do this like rom stuff. It'll be great. And I'm like, holy cow, that's fantastic. And I said, so how do you know this? And he said, well, the company I'm working for is going to make, tuning programs for this. And actually, I was kind of wondering about, you're like the only person I know that does anything with non-equity temperament. When I get my job and we start working on this tuning editor thing, do you think I could like call you and ask you questions about stuff? And I'll give you a free copy of the software for it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>And I'm thinking free copy of the software. This is awesome. Sure, man. No problem. So we moved to, we moved to Wisconsin and he moves out to California. And at a certain point I hear back from him and he says, well, I'm gonna be working on some other projects, but you know, there's this other guy that works, with our company who probably is gonna be doing this, and so is it okay if I put you in touch with him? And I said, yeah, sure. And you know, he said, don't worry, the deal's still on about the software and stuff. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> said, sure, no problem. And a little while later, this guy called me and he was David Zaccarelli. And since the really great part of the story is the guy who used to come to my gigs was Doug Wyatt, who's now like oms, core Audio. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>He's, you know, pretty important guy at Apple. But I knew him when he was like a really happy, great piano player, <laugh>. And so that's how, that's how I met David. And I knew David for years and years. You know, he just, we just call up every couple of months and say, what are you listening to? What are you reading? What are you working on? And, that's, that's sort of how I got to know David. And sometime much, I mean, way later, <span style="color:red" data-ts="711.86" data-end_ts="711.98" title="711.86" id=c_"711.86">__a__</span> decade later, he asked me if I wanted to do some work from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_%2774">Cycling '74</a> And, you know, when you get asked a question like that, you, you just kind of don't turn it down. Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="723.34" data-end_ts="723.78" title="723.34" id=c_"723.34">__Because__</span> he's such a great, you know, he's such a great guy. It was software that I used. I thought it would be great. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Yeah. So, that's how I got to be more or less where I am. What else do you need to know? Oh, the only other thing that might be interesting to know about me is that, I do and have done for nearly 30 years a radio program of experimental music on the radio, in addition to that other stuff. And, let's see, when my wife goes to the Netherlands on sabbatical or for research trips, I tag along. And during one of those trips, I was, enrolled at the world <span style="color:red" data-ts="760.8" data-end_ts="761.22" title="760.8" id=c_"760.8">__famous__</span>, little known, little understood institute of Sonology, which is one of those things that people who know me or a little bit surprised about. But I was actually a sonologist in the late 1980s, early 1990s. So that's pretty much who I am, I guess. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, there's, there's an awful lot that was just presented there. And, and, it's funny because, in, you know, you do the Midwestern Ultra laid back, I'm not the smartest guy in the room kind of thing, really pretty pervasively. But, the flip side of it is you've, you kind of had your thumb on a on an awful lot of interesting things over the years. I mean, yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>I got <span style="color:red" data-ts="804.18" data-end_ts="804.3" title="804.18" id=c_"804.18">__luck__</span>. I got lucky that I got lucky that way, or I got luck. I was lucky enough to be interested in that stuff. And also to have, friends and acquaintances who didn't think that a lack of credentialing, I'm not sure what the word we want is, but who saw no reason not to try to explain something that I was obviously interested in and passionately curious about. And also leftover from my old days as like a seventh grade kid with headphones on listening to, the BBC's murder Mystery and Mayhem Sound <span style="color:red" data-ts="839.78" data-end_ts="840.14" title="839.78" id=c_"839.78">__Effect__</span> records. I had the chance to kind of think about the things that interested me without having a lot of people around telling me what I should and shouldn't find. Interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I think that that's really interesting because, that sort of undirected exploration is something that I think we don't do very much anymore. And, I, I noticed this really, seriously when the university I teach at, where they decided to, make the library less about a place for book storage and more about like a meeting place and a media space, right? Hmm. So they took all their books, pretty much out of the building and shoved them into a warehouse downtown. Wow. And, and then basically said, okay, you can search for books and if you find something you want, just, pull it and we'll have it here. You know, we'll have shuttles going back and forth constantly. We'll have it here in an hour. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>And I <span style="color:red" data-ts="900.74" data-end_ts="901.06" title="900.74" id=c_"900.74">__found__</span> that was my old, that was my old public library if you wanted to get a record Yeah. That's what you had to do. You couldn't pull things down off the shelf and look at the covers. Right. And, and, and find like a lady wearing a skimp, you know, a woman wearing a skimpy dress. And that would be really cool. And you'd, cuz of course I'm in seventh grade, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="920.36" data-end_ts="920.58" title="920.36" id=c_"920.36">__Cuz__</span> you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="920.72" data-end_ts="920.94" title="920.72" id=c_"920.72">__Got__</span> to, so I check it out. Right. It's Martin Denny. Oh, funny. Right. So that's, again, I've, I wound up looking at cool stuff for maybe the wrong reasons, but when the number of options available to you are open, the possibility for surprise goes way up. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, and you know, like in the case of this library, I find that my, the amount of interesting stuff I bring home from the library is almost nil now because, what I, what I had found, and what I've always found with libraries is that the book that I really want is never the one I'm looking for. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Yeah. You can, can, it's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Always the one that's Yeah. It's always the one that's like down two shelves Yep. And over to the right a little bit. You 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Know? That's Exactly, that's exactly right. And when you think of it, one of the, one of the real ridiculous problems of our enabling technologies is that just about the only people who pay attention to that particular loss. In other words, the idea of thinking of a bookshelf as a kind of <span style="color:red" data-ts="987.58" data-end_ts="987.7" title="987.58" id=c_"987.58">__a__</span> field of vision mm-hmm. <affirmative>, which has something randomly to do with the Dewey Decimal system or the Library of Congress or whatever system you use, that the only people who think about versions of that in the electronic world are trying to sell us something. Right. Right. So there's nobody who kind of makes, provides ways for us to browse an idea unless you're willing to like, spend, you know, lots of time with search engines, which is always for me, why? And again, this goes back to the people who assisted in the formation of my sensibility. Unless you have trusted agents like little weirdos planted in weird places where you can basically people to whom you can go and say, can you tell me a little bit about what you're really interested in? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And then you kind of watch, you kind of watch to see when they, when they lean forward or when they lower their voice or when, or when their description of something, drops to a conspiratorial whisper. Right. And you think, oh man, this is it. This is 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The good stuff. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Oh, totally. Totally. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Because I feel like, I feel like a lot of how I got to be what I am was from a similar thing of doing the stuff that, that was uncommon and doing it because nobody told me. Well, I, I certainly got the hint from my, fellow students that it was not cool 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b><laugh>. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, me too. But I didn't really care because I wasn't, I wasn't particularly cool anyway. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>But, well, or in some, or in some cases there's no after, sometimes after a lot of thought or sometimes after no thought at all, you realize there's kind of no point in not finding something interesting. Right, right. That what in, in the end, I mean, we all want to be accepted. We all want to be interesting, we all want to be loved, but kind of in the end only listening to people who we think are going to be successful. Cuz that's, boy, that's a moving window if ever there was one Yeah. Really isn't gonna help us do that. And that often we find ourselves in situations where <span style="color:red" data-ts="1139.28" data-end_ts="1139.4" title="1139.28" id=c_"1139.28">__I__</span> get to where we are by some bizarre lovely means. Like, I would never have probably gone to work for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_%2774">Cycling '74</a> had I never gone been unworried about going to a vegetarian restaurant with a bunch of juice glasses, <laugh>, physical tape loops and Revok 77 things that I would like stru around the inside of the store and make something that looked ridiculous. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Right. You know, had that not happened, I would never be where I am today. So every time I think of doing something stupid, and that often occurs to me, to be honest, cuz I do dumb stuff all the time. It, I've, I guess I feel like I'm really lucky to have had situations where the dumb stuff I did, how do I say this? The dumb stuff I did didn't work out the way that I thought. So I wasn't able to come away from the experience and say, yep, I planned that out <laugh> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1202.74" data-end_ts="1202.96" title="1202.74" id=c_"1202.74">__you__</span>, you don't really get to do that. But the thing that happens instead is actually better than you thought you were gonna get. And then the only thing you have to <span style="color:red" data-ts="1212.36" data-end_ts="1212.56" title="1212.36" id=c_"1212.36">__work__</span>, the only like, personal trial after that is whether you wanna lie about it. Right. And imply, well, yes, I planted that from the beginning, <laugh>. I mean, that's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1222.74" data-end_ts="1222.96" title="1222.74" id=c_"1222.74">__cuz__</span> a lot of self promotions about that as opposed to saying, you know, I just, it just, it, it <span style="color:red" data-ts="1230.5" data-end_ts="1230.72" title="1230.5" id=c_"1230.5">__ha__</span> it just happened and it 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Fell out of the sky. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>I'm as surprised about it as you are. Right? Yeah. And when I think of lots of, you know, my experience of, collaborating with people, I think when I was younger, maybe I had the idea that I was, that it would be really good of me to choose people who to work with, to play with people that I respected more than people I liked. Boy, there's, that's a little complicated, but just bear with me. There. There's, so there was this idea that I thought what was gonna make me better or great, or cooler or whatever was gonna be finding somebody I really respected and worked really hard with them, even if we didn't get along or we didn't, you know, despite all those other things, something magical was going to happen as a result of it. And a lot of the time it didn't. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>And I then I, I would go in, I'd feel really horrible and I'd think, oh, I'm never gonna get anywhere and my self-promotional skills are awful. And at a certain point I realized that playing with people that I liked was a great place to start first because I was lucky enough to know some people that I liked who were willing to accept me and were really great and interesting musicians. And playing with people you like, has a sort of an interesting side effect. First of all, you feel accepted so you can take risks, in some cases risks you wouldn't even take with yourself, right. Because somebody trusts you. Right. You can do that. But secondly, you can, you can be surprised in ways that you don't <span style="color:red" data-ts="1335.97" data-end_ts="1336.19" title="1335.97" id=c_"1335.97">__sur__</span> surprise yourself. And in fact, when I think about the work that I'm doing now, one of the, remember how we talked about unintended consequences, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>I have an interesting unintended consequence right now. And that is, at a certain point, I, I had this body of solo work and I had people that I trusted with handling the work. You yourself, in fact, as my mastering engineer, no, this <span style="color:red" data-ts="1359.87" data-end_ts="1360.07" title="1359.87" id=c_"1359.87">__is__</span>, well, as anybody I people I would say, I trust you to make the best of this. This is as far as I can take this thing. At a certain point when I started playing with people, I realized that, there was this thing that only happened when I did that. And the thing <span style="color:red" data-ts="1376.89" data-end_ts="1377.11" title="1376.89" id=c_"1376.89">__was__</span> had something to do with the fact that despite all of my talk about algorithmic stuff, I wasn't as good at being surprised and displaced in a way that got me to do something different as working with other people. The unintended consequence, the first con unintended consequence was, I just love the people that I work with. It's a ball to be in the groups that I work in. The unintended consequence is when that's over and it fades and you go back to working alone, you realize, you sit down in the studio and you think, how am I gonna surprise myself <laugh>, what on earth can I possibly do? That wouldn't be what I expect. And, I confess that's, I'm spending a, I'm spending a lot of time thinking about that these days. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Surprise can come in so many, so many ways too. I mean, the surprise can come from you making what you would consider an error and somebody taking that and turning it into Oh yeah. A highlight, right? <span style="color:red" data-ts="1445.85" data-end_ts="1446.07" title="1445.85" id=c_"1445.85">__Yep__</span>. Or, someone misconstruing what you've done and assuming that the one of a rhythm is in a different place and changing the accenting completely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1457.93" data-end_ts="1458.15" title="1457.93" id=c_"1457.93">__Now__</span>, those kinds of things are pretty amazing. So, you were pretty circumspect there about who <laugh> you might have, collaborated with that wasn't necessarily, wasn't necessarily a friendly situation, but, I'm, I'm wanna go back to something you talked about earlier a little bit, which is, your interaction with the cassette culture. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Oh yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, we haven't had a lot of people on the podcast yet who ha who were kind of into the cassette culture thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Well, a lot of them weren't old enough. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? Well, there's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1494.79" data-end_ts="1494.87" title="1494.79" id=c_"1494.79">__that__</span>. Well, but even those who are I think have a tendency to view that as a transitional phase for themselves. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Oh, not, not for me. Not at all. Oh, no. So for those of you, for those of you who may not know it, if you're really young, you're probably accustomed to thinking that cassettes are kind of cool. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, there was a period of time a lot earlier than now, and I would date it from, the middle late 1970s all the way up to kind of the nineties where there was an, an entire culture composed of people who did almost all of their work in small runs as cassette recordings. And there was a whole, not only were there a ton of people who did it and not, it's not true that everybody knew everyone else, but it was really widespread. But also there were, sort of organizations and modes of distribution, and particularly things like magazines, like op, which turned into option later on. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>And, magazines like Sound Choice, who, who basically were, that was kind of the place where those people met. I started working on it because after I left and moved back up north, I still had some of my gear left over. I mean, there was some stuff that you just didn't really carry around that much cuz it was too heavy, you know, humping a a b <span style="color:red" data-ts="1585.67" data-end_ts="1585.87" title="1585.67" id=c_"1585.67">__four__</span> up and down the stairs to your third floor apartment. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1588.53" data-end_ts="1588.75" title="1588.53" id=c_"1588.53">__It__</span>, it doesn't work. Right. However, the little mini <span style="color:red" data-ts="1591.48" data-end_ts="1591.83" title="1591.48" id=c_"1591.48">__court__</span> Oh yeah, no problem. Or the Kumar string on, you know, that. So I had that stuff and a friend of mine who is basically, moving up in the recording studio world decided to sell a four track recorder and I bought it. That was, and so I had this like, great recorder, a couple of a friend from this, bar band I played in North Carolina had moved back up north. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>He was interested in having me do some work with him and, and helping to produce, because I always had quote unquote good ideas mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And so I went into the recording studio. I'd never really done any multi-track recording before. And the other thing to remember is, since I was still a visual artist in those days, I was doing work that was, that took forever to dry. So it was this like dense kind of layered stuff, and you'd lay something down and you'd have to wait a week for it to dry and then do something else. And, okay. So I was, I was doing this like slow kind of work. So I went into the recording studio to work with my friend, and, it was a ball. You could do stuff that was, it sounds so silly to say this now, but it was the first time that I, that I ran across this idea that a recording, the purpose of making a recording is not to make a document of a perfect event, but rather it's this thing that you can kind of put down in erase and you're transferring something in the air to a discrete symbolic domain. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1683.34" data-end_ts="1683.46" title="1683.34" id=c_"1683.34">__A__</span> like piece of tape that you can like cut. I know this, gosh, this sounds so stupid to say, but it was like the heavens cracked open and a giant bolt of lightning dropped on my head and said, well, you know what, as long as this was on tape, there's no reason in the world you can't goof around with the tape. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> instead of goofing around with the performance, goof around with what you made it into and make that into something else. And moreover, since you're doing that, you could do something where like the only person making any noise on this whole recording, this giant band is nothing but you. At which point, of course your, your inner adult wakes up and says, well, wait, you can't play that, or you don't actually have any real talent. Right. Well, happily, the inner adult was not somebody I was listening to in those days. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>So I started doing these cassette things, and since I read option when it came out faithfully every two months, I sent it off to option. And, and it got reviewed and the person that reviewed it didn't say it was a sucky piece of nonsense by some lame charlatan who never had a good, I, you know what I mean? Like, all the things you're afraid of didn't happen. It was like, gosh, this is really interesting. These are like imaginary cultural artifacts. I think it was like one of the first reviews I ever got. And I, I like read the thing first. I was completely excited, as you might imagine, but I read the thing and I thought imaginary cultural artifact. Hmm. And then I thought, well, you know, actually when I think about the kind of painting I'm doing, that's really what I'm doing. And so all of a sudden I had, I had an informing metaphor for who I was gonna be. And that was, I was going to make imaginary cultural objects. I was going to imagine society's, whose rituals I would document in detail. And if I was really lucky, there would be people who would not realize that the rituals were entirely made up. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Yeah. And after that it was, you know, there it was, it was a great, you know, you hate having people tell you how long after time has passed something. Like it was a great time to be doing work, but you know what it was, it was on the other side of the whole d i y punk ethos, the idea that, this particular kind of music had like, you know, I don't wanna say no cultural capital, but it's, medium of exchange or its currency exchange rate was wildly flu, fluctuated wildly. And it wasn't like the art world in the eighties where suddenly people started making millions of of dollars. It was, everybody was still scribbling. And so the playing field was flat. And that has arisen again, but in a very, very different, in a very different way now. But it was, I was so lucky to have been around when I was, and to have that community be the net that I fell into. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. I find it fascinating that, you know, different people travel different paths and either do or do not, fall into these sort of safety nets of loving community Yeah. To totally arbitrarily. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Oh yeah. Yeah. And, and every time I see, you know, every time you walk by somebody who's an obvious psychic distress, I guess this marks me as a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1909.78" data-end_ts="1909.9" title="1909.78" id=c_"1909.78">__a__</span> as a sort of bizarre overthinking guilty white liberal. But I guess what I feel like is there are people who find themselves in positions of great pain and psychic suffering because no one, there was no community among whom they moved, who <span style="color:red" data-ts="1930.08" data-end_ts="1930.24" title="1930.08" id=c_"1930.08">__is__</span> willing to call them back onto the path. And I got really lucky in the sense that there was this whole sort of modality about coming to think about the world and things that you could do that were, that were not dangerous and, didn't brand you as a pariah. And I sort of think about like how my life would've been had I not had that as, a means of expression. You know, you don't wanna say, it always feels funny to say something like the ability to do art or the ability to tunnel into this little microculture, save me that, that goes a little bit far. But there's a sense in which it does make you, it does make you the person that you are. And it gives you, it gives you a set of sensibilities that you can bring back to your real life. I don't know to put that in quotes, but you bring to your real life and share with other people. Right. And that's a great mur. It's a great mercy and a blessing. And the world is full of people who perish for the simple want of that kind of experience. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I you yeah, I hear that. So in, in your interaction with this culture, with this, group of people, that just basically shed their inner editor as much as they could and started shipping off cassettes to, well, they shipped them off to Option Magazine, but you also would trade among other people, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Oh, sure. Absolutely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And so, is that, how many, how much did you get to know people just because they randomly sent you a cassette and you picked up the conversation from there? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>That's actually pretty surprising. There are, I wouldn't say a substantial number, but, a lot of my, there's a lot of, sort of relationships and people who help to form my current sensibility, particularly with respect to things like technology that I met that way. In fact, the one that I still keep going back with and, and just kind of shaking my head and dumb surprises, back in the days, back in the late seventies and early eighties, I would probably have to say that one of my very favorite labels in the entire world, like Full Stop, was, palace of Lights in Seattle. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, it was a little cassette label, that went to doing LPs later on. The first thing that the first work of, of theirs that they ever encountered was this thing called Music for Land and Water. Which was, just exquisite. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Do you know what I mean? That sort of thing where you <span style="color:red" data-ts="2108.49" data-end_ts="2108.71" title="2108.49" id=c_"2108.49">__is__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2111.81" data-end_ts="2112.03" title="2111.81" id=c_"2111.81">__my__</span> even microcultures have, have this feature about them that work tends to kind of cluster mm-hmm. <affirmative> and, for whatever reasons, despite people who are in different parts of the country that wind up doing work that kind of resembles each other. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> and, and it's not a new thing. If we looked at, if we looked at, corresponding communities in the 17th century, people who wrote letters to each other, we'd find the same thing. It just happens that we're talking about cassettes now. Right. But in the midst of those things, even that, even in those little microcultures, you get something that would, just like the hairs on the back of your neck would stand up when you heard it. You just thought, oh man, this is, you know, it's, it's this kind of combination, at least for me, I'm sure everybody else in the world is different. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Instead of saying like, I could do that, or how do I do that? Like the f my first response to it is this kind of like <span style="color:red" data-ts="2169.42" data-end_ts="2169.54" title="2169.42" id=c_"2169.42">__a__</span> wonder out the wholeness of it. And then much later after you recover, the thing is over and you count five and draw a breath, and then you say like something like, either where did that come from? Or What is that? Right. So Palace of Lights was like one of those things. And so it would be <span style="color:red" data-ts="2189" data-end_ts="2189.22" title="2189" id=c_"2189">__at__</span>, to this day, I do that. There are authors, there are writers I always buy in hardback cuz somehow or other, we kind of made some connections. So from then on, anything they do, I'll, I'll pick up. I won't look at the reviews, I won't look at anything about it. I'll just get it. Because my sense is that they're people that I trust. And one of the astounding things for me, like I can't believe this happened to me was I grew up and I'm now on Palace of Lights. Do you know what I mean? That's sort of like saying, yes, I now record for E C M. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>You know, it's that kind of thing. And that's, that's been one of the great, pleasures of my life. Lot of the people who taught me analog synthesis were people that I met in cassette culture. It was a great thing. And also when the time came that I started doing, my radio show, it turned out that the work that I knew from that period of time was really the beginning. That was the beginning of the work that I programmed. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Let's talk a little bit more about your radio show. How long has it been going now? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Oh man. Let's see. My wife, probably 1986. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh my goodness. I know. So getting on 20 years. Yeah. Unbelievable. 30 years or 30 years. Oh my God. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Yeah. It's kind of, it's kind of scary. I don't even feel like I should be, I shouldn't be 30 years old yet. Right. You know what I mean? It's kinda like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2290.01" data-end_ts="2290.23" title="2290.01" id=c_"2290.01">__ugh__</span>. And since it sounds scary, here's the only way I can actually do it. I just think of it as something I did once a week for a really long time. Right. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>And still do 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well. So you kind of say that that like some of what you experienced with, some of what you, you experienced in your cassette culture days was kind of informative in your radio show. First of all, why don't you explain to people, what the name of the show is, what kind of stuff <span style="color:red" data-ts="2324.76" data-end_ts="2324.98" title="2324.76" id=c_"2324.76">__for__</span> the program Okay. And how they could listen to it if they chose to 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Show. No problem. A number of you listening probably know what Community Radio is. It's a sort of volunteer sponsored community. It's kind of like a different, slightly different step sideways from public radio. But in the city of Madison, Wisconsin, we have a community radio station that's been on the air for, I don't know, 35, maybe 40. It's been a long time. But basically, I started working there. I substituted for someone for, part of a year in starting in oh, the mid eighties. And I've been on the air since about 1986 with a couple of breaks when, I moved to Brav to live with my wife. And so I do a weekly radio program. Used to be on from eight to 10. It's now on from nine to 11 central daylight standard time. And it is streamed if you're ever interested in listening to it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>It's a program of really by now whatever I want to program <laugh>. Back when I started doing the show, the idea was I was supposed to do a show that followed, it came after a show of world music, which in the 1980s, world music was not global Pop world music was like ethnographic recordings and folk singers. Right. And then there was a guy that came off on after me, one of another of my great teachers, bill Milo, who did this great show called System Considerations. That was much more, you know, compared to, the Clancy Brothers and, Ghanaian funeral music, which was sort of what the World music show was. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, Bill's show was kind of like tape loops of power tools and stuff like that. <laugh>. So the woman who <span style="color:red" data-ts="2427.78" data-end_ts="2427.86" title="2427.78" id=c_"2427.78">__is__</span> the music director said, you know, we've got a problem here at the station. We'd like to do a show that started out being sounding a little bit like the World Music Show. And then over a couple of hours it can get like weirder and stranger so that when the two hours is up, people will keep the radio on for the next show. Could you do that? Right. And I thought, yeah, but of course now I'm on after the gospel show. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I was gonna say, it's, it's clear to me that that perception that, that you had to be sort of like a bridge is totally out the window. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Oh, it's gone. It's totally gone. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You're led in by a, a all out gospel show. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Oh yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Absolutely. And then afterwards is, the Noise Fest. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2468.28" data-end_ts="2468.5" title="2468.28" id=c_"2468.28">__Yep__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Yep. So the great thing about my station, and I'm going to to stop talking about myself and brag about my radio station for just a minute, is we have what I believe to be the single largest swath of experimental <span style="color:red" data-ts="2481.19" data-end_ts="2481.54" title="2481.19" id=c_"2481.19">__music__</span> programming on the radio anywhere that I know of. We start at nine o'clock on Sunday evening and we go until Dawn the next morning mm-hmm. <affirmative> and it's extraordinary stuff. And again, it's listener sponsored community radio, which means that we're able to do it because we have listeners who really think that that's an important thing to do and who in turn trust us as programmers. So for me, first it's a ball to do. I mean, cuz all I really do is say I have all this great stuff and I'm, I'm playing records for my friends. Right. That's really, really what I'm doing. But also I'm paying back every single person that loaned me something cool mm-hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b><affirmative> or came to me and said something like, either like, I don't, I know you're gonna think this is weird, but, or who said, you know, I think you might actually like this. And of course if I didn't, then they'd say, wow, why didn't you know they'd Right. We'd have those conversations. And, a lot of those people are no longer in my life. Some of them sadly have passed away, and I will never, ever be able to properly thank them for the tremendous gift of their time and their generosity. And the only thing you can do in a case like that is pay that baby forward. And so that's, that's one of the reasons I still do it, is because I ain't paid that gift back yet. And there's almost nothing with the possible exception of playing for people and making them happy, there's almost nothing in the world that is more monetarily not useful, but personally astounding, satisfying as sharing something with somebody and watching, watching the clouds crack open or watching their pupils dilate or watching them kind of like raise their head and stare off into space and think they got it right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>You know, that's, that's what makes you keep doing art and it's what makes you write about it. It's what makes you share it. And it just, like, it's one of the greatest things human beings get to do, period. Full stop. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's really, that's really a great way to think about it and to, and to stay and to stay committed to it. Because doing anything for three decades is a kind of commitment that isn't necessarily easy to fulfill. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Well, yeah. Except that, you know, you have, you know, people, you probably know people who have, who have pursued sobriety for a long time. Right. Or people who have had great goals, or people who have had, long-term nourishing primary relationships. And one of the things that they all say is something about the idea that they do it a little tiny piece at a time. Right. That every chance you have to choose, to choose in the name of loyalty or choose what is good and beautiful instead of something else, that every time you have a chance to make that little choice, then that's the choice you make. And, and doing that choice over and over and over makes something happen. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2678.92" data-end_ts="2679.14" title="2678.92" id=c_"2678.92">__And__</span> we have not said anything about gear or music, have <span style="color:red" data-ts="2681.54" data-end_ts="2681.66" title="2681.54" id=c_"2681.54">__we__</span>? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>No, no, not yet. But you know, that I'm 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sorry. No, but that tends to be the, the way that this goes, because the fact of the matter is, the internet is a really good way to exchange information about gear. So I can do a blog post or a post on Muff Wiggler or whatever and blurt out something about gear and someone else will blurt something back out. And we can exchange gear stuff real easily. The internet turns out not to be a very good mechanism for talking about things like creativity and influences and the way that we, the way that we mature as artists. Right. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>It doesn't help us with that. You're right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. And so that's, it's funny, but I think that, that, that tends to be when people start talking, they realize, oh, I can actually communicate about this or ask questions about this or whatever, but I can explore this area that just isn't something I get to do in my day, my day-to-day run. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Well, the other stuff is, is much harder. It's much harder work. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2750.82" data-end_ts="2751.02" title="2750.82" id=c_"2750.82">__The__</span> as as wonderful it is as it is. And man, it is having access to this like huge broad, relatively flat or shallow, shallow information space is, I mean, you know, you don't wanna say we live in the golden age, but in some respects it's astounding that that's the case. But one of the things that happens is you realize that that also means that there's this really special kind of crazy that comes from, having too much choice and also from having, not enough trusted agents. Boy, that sounds kind of more market ease than I would really want, but, but the idea of, somebody whose advice goes beyond what you can write down about something. Right. So, for me, one of the things I've decided, to take some really tiny steps toward, personally, is <span style="color:red" data-ts="2809.4" data-end_ts="2809.62" title="2809.4" id=c_"2809.4">__at__</span> partially in an attempt to surprise myself again, after years and years and years, I've gone back to looking at analog synthesis. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>And one of the things about it that's insanely bewildering, it's both great and bewildering, is the number of options available to, to me, are a whole lot bigger. Things are more idiosyncratic and peculiar and, all of those idiosyncratic and peculiar things, the, the the thousand choices I have. Because back in the old days in Bulgaria, there was only one kind of oscillator and it only had one kind of waveform. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="2844.8" data-end_ts="2845.02" title="2844.8" id=c_"2844.8">__th__</span> man, those days are gone. But Right. The thing you don't have is the person that you talk to after you read the stuff, <laugh> the person that will tell you the silly thing that that resonates with you, the person that will say, you know, so here's a piece of advice from you. I will use Darwin Gross as an example of what trusted agents tell you that, technical specifications don't, because I was thinking about this today. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>We were talking at, at some point, Darwin and I were talking about filters because it turns out he and I both really like filters. We're really interested in them. And I was talking about what kinds of filters would fit in the rack and how they'd work. And Darwin said something that nobody else so far had said to me. And after he told me this, I thought about it. And every time I looked at a filter after this, I checked it out. And here's what he told me. He said, well, you know, the thing about filter, one of the things about filters, it really bothers me is, is like you've got this whole range on the knob and there's a whole bunch of filters where there's only like four places on the knob that the filter does much, or there'll be like a full third of a turn or a quarter of a turn on the knob where nothing really happens that you can hear. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>So that really bothers me. No technical specification will tell you that, in fact, and I've looked for it. I've actually gone online and I've looked and looking at the YouTube videos doesn't show you that either, but you know what, that turns out to be really important. And it's just like a dumb thing nobody talks about is like, what's, what's the throw on the dial do? Because that's this weird combination of like, what's in your ear, what's under your fingers, and how the, your physical relationship with the technology maps to what you hear, that's what trusted agents tell you, and that's what all of those gear lists don't tell you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. I think that there's another really important thing that that's kind of, an adjunct to that, which is that the way that like modular systems are now, but the way that a lot of sort of piece part technology stuff works is that it used to be you used to have to buy one person's vision. So you and I were buying keyboards at roughly the same time in our early days. So like, oh yeah. So like if you bought into the Oberheim game 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Yep. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You bought into Tom Oberheims vision of how knobs worked, and buttons pressed and key beds played, and if you were an Oberheim guy, you bought into the Oberheim stuff. That's true. And if you were a mo guy, you'd try the Oberheim, you'd be like, Jesus, I don't know why the knob works this way. And I gotta <span style="color:red" data-ts="3024.22" data-end_ts="3024.38" title="3024.22" id=c_"3024.22">__put__</span> Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Filter the filter. Sure. Sound good though. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? Right. <laugh>, and, you know, you would, you would end up have sort of like embracing a guy's or you know, a company, but in most time, most cases, those companies were an extension of a guy. You really bought into that guy's vision of how everything works. Now if you happen to put together a system that's all from one person, people look at you like, wow, you weren't very creative when you looked at <span style="color:red" data-ts="3054.42" data-end_ts="3054.66" title="3054.42" id=c_"3054.42">__them__</span> <laugh>, you know, no. Could. And so instead argue you're mixing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="3057.48" data-end_ts="3057.7" title="3057.48" id=c_"3057.48">__Or__</span> you could argue that I think like, I think like the guy who designs everything for, make noise or mutable instruments or whatever mm-hmm. <affirmative>, you're right though in the sense that one of the great things about the landscape that we see before us is that, you know, back in the day, you used to have to choose based on, efficiency or a small number of things that were available. And that with, especially with explosion of software that's particularly different, you can now choose something based on, your emotional comfort with how a piece of software works. Or for example, if you're a strong supporter of the notion of open source software, you can use, some ideological idea to basically guide your choice of tools. Right. That's an astounding, I think that's an astoundingly wonderful thing to do. And we're certainly not going to spend all of our time talking about gear. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>But I think I would say that if I think about the tools that I use now, and obviously, Maxim, s p and Jitter are, that's the bulk of my performing and creating life. That is true. But instead of endorsing that long and hard and turning this into some kind of marketing thing, I would say something else about it. And that is, I started using it because I, you know, I started using it before I worked for the company. And I, when I encountered it, I was, it was a presentation in an upstairs room, in a building in the city of <span style="color:red" data-ts="3148.8" data-end_ts="3149.02" title="3148.8" id=c_"3148.8">__re__</span> in 1989 done by Court <span style="color:red" data-ts="3150.9" data-end_ts="3151.1" title="3150.9" id=c_"3150.9">__Lip__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3151.1" data-end_ts="3151.3" title="3151.1" id=c_"3151.1">__and__</span> Zack Settle that somebody had told me about, I'd taken the train in from the Hague, it was a school day for me. And I got in and I sat in this room and I saw them showed this thing that in those days was called the Patcher. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And the Patcher had this thing where there were these boxes and you could connect A to B to C, and they were jokey and funny. But the thing that I kept thinking about, I kept watching was this idea that you could also connect C to B to A or B to A to C, that there was something about that idea that everything about it was configurable. That really got me thinking about the idea that the person that designs the software you use in the same case as the instrument, set some kind of agenda. And to me, that was the seed. Like 1989 is the little seed in my head that was planted that said, you know, this could be different. You could do this yourself, and if you did it yourself, then well, if you screwed up, it would be your fault. But you don't have to take somebody else's word for it. And that's, that's one of those insight, that's one of those like aesthetic insights that delivered me to where I am today. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, let's talk about where that is today, because, so you're one of the people I know that has built sort of a monolithic performance system. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b><laugh>, I sure don't think of it that way, but Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I mean, in comparison to me, so I, I've talked to a lot of people and a lot of, a lot of people that use Mac or or reactor or other building type tools tend to make small sort of like tactical bits and pieces, and then for each <span style="color:red" data-ts="3258.12" data-end_ts="3258.34" title="3258.12" id=c_"3258.12">__gig__</span> you kind of tack together the pieces that make sense. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3261.3" data-end_ts="3261.46" title="3261.3" id=c_"3261.3">__Ah__</span>, yeah. And you perform that way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>The patch is the performance or the patch is the piece. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. The patch is the piece. Right. You have used Max to create, what I would simply say is, your <span style="color:red" data-ts="3276.8" data-end_ts="3277.02" title="3276.8" id=c_"3276.8">__in__</span> idiosyncratic view of a single piece of software that represents your performance. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Yeah. And nobody could be more surprised by that than I, than I am, I guess. Yes. But you're absolutely, you're absolutely right. I did. And, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Why are you surprised by it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Because I would've said, you know, it's sort of like, drop me in the time machine and send me back 20, 25 years, to talk to the kid that I was like, he would've answered the door and said, what's this old bald guy doing on my doorstep? <laugh>. And I would've said, kid, you gotta, you know, you think about giving yourself advice. In the past, I would've thought that I would grow up and be one of those people that made one patch per piece. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, I just always assumed it was gonna be what I was. And I think what wound up happening was I started, I started hearing recordings because here's the problem. I live in the Midwest of the United States, so my opportunity to see people perform is relatively limited. And also I'm a radio programmer. So often, works of art would be mediated by recorded instantiations rather than seeing people live. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>But over time, I began to realize that there was this thing that some of the people that I really respected were doing, and I wasn't sure I could do it myself, but I respected it enough to think about trying it. And it kind of took a couple of forms. The first form was, that they, they made instruments that changed slowly. So instead of building one patch per piece, what you do is you build a thing and you'd start with it. And then you'd, after a couple of performances or a couple of recordings, you'd say, you know, know I spent a lot of time on this, but this little bit of it doesn't really work. And the part that was really crucial for getting me to start thinking that way was I realized that a lot of the people that I respected were able to kind of be light on their feet. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>And, compared to, there's a lot of people that are much lighter on their feet than I am, and many of whom I play with, Jeff Geer comes immediately to mind who's dances like Fred <span style="color:red" data-ts="3408.37" data-end_ts="3408.66" title="3408.37" id=c_"3408.37">__Aste__</span>, for Pete's sake, <laugh>. But, but there was this idea that those people had this notion that the controllers that they used, instead of having those things matched per piece or per performance, the performance, the, the controllers were fixed enough that the idea of thinking about what to do next was something that was under your fingers instead of on the screen. You still needed the screen to see what it was. Right. But to me, when I, the first time I saw John, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="3438.54" data-end_ts="3438.78" title="3438.54" id=c_"3438.54">__Ican__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3438.81" data-end_ts="3439.1" title="3438.81" id=c_"3438.81">__seer__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3439.1" data-end_ts="3439.58" title="3439.1" id=c_"3439.1">__Janelle__</span> perform with radio, the lights went on because I realized that what I was seeing was the things he was doing, or the way that he could think as he worked was possible because stuff was under his fingers. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>It wasn't software on a screen, it was a thing that was in his hands. And I thought, oh crap. That's an awesome, I bet, you know, and by this time, my max was good enough where I thought, you know, I guess I could actually, I guess I could actually do that, couldn't I mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And so I worked real hard and I got something set up. And then after a couple of gigs, I thought, well, this part that I work, and of course it's always the part you <span style="color:red" data-ts="3475.14" data-end_ts="3475.34" title="3475.14" id=c_"3475.14">__work__</span> the hardest on, right? Is like, you have this great idea and you set it up and, and it just, it sounds terrible, right? Right. And, but very gradually, the little pieces, the little stuff that I, that I made and the things that I would've thought I'd spend my whole life reproducing new versions of, kind of coalesced into things that were the way that I thought, you know, they, they weren't, it wasn't like, it wasn't like they coalesced into verse forms, like a villanelle or haiku or something like that, where you have this like shared verse form that everyone in the world writes in mm-hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b><affirmative>. But it was more this kind of like collections of phrases and things that made sense to me. And they were the things, they were the things that I thought with instead of the things that I thought about. Okay. And to me, that's the point at which I started thinking about, making instruments. And I was pretty far into doing it before I realized that I didn't necessarily know a lot of people who did that, because it seemed to me at the time, and this is probably one of the reasons that I'm not wildly famous, by the way, here's, so here's another good piece of advice to those of you seeking worldly fame and fortune. I realized that the other part of building the instrument was I had to absolutely be sure that I could fail. Right. That was really, really, really important. Well, that's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Kinda interesting because an awful lot of people use technology, especially in performance, use technology as a way to avoid failure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Oh, sure. Absolutely. Well, so come to, come to, come to think of it. So do I, I do try to write software that won't crash the second I start using it. But there's this other notion that you have, how do we say this? You, of the possible choices you have. It's really tempting, especially because we don't have, we don't have a typology for instruments yet. So software instruments, you know, we joke about reading emails sitting at your laptop, but the truth is, there's not a uniformly acceptable idea of what playing a laptop as an instrument means, which means virtuosity is really hard to determine for an audience. And if you're interested as a performer in having an audience think you're awesome while you're doing something, instead of getting to the end of what you perform and saying, God, you know, that, that had like form and shape and logic to it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>If you want people to think he's really doing something, then you configure his software so that you choose, you know, three obvious things to do. You map those to three giant gestures, like the giant, you know, the slot machine knob on the side of your interface, or the biggest knob or fader that you have, and then you like punch the air with one hand and goof with that fader when in fact nothing is at risk. Right. So for a very long time, I don't do it anymore, but for a very long time I had a button on my software instrument. And, this is true confession time, and some of my collaborators will probably be, surprised and used and possibly disgusted to hear this. The big red button in the upper left hand corner of my machine randomly loaded sound files, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>So when I, so what I said was, if I'm gonna do this, when I started doing live performance, and I think of it now, I, I was insane. I said, I will walk out on stage with nothing. Right. I'll have a thing running that I, you know, I'll have a thing running that I understand, but it'll just be loaded up with stuff. And you know, half of it'll be Indonesian, a bunch of it'll be bird calls, there'll be, you know, ice in a martini glass and I'm just gonna have to do something with that. And happily working with other players, let me get away from that a little bit because they would do that, right? And they had a better set of sounds than I did, or they had things I didn't know. Whereas all the junk on my hard disc was always, I, you know, there were a million of them. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>And if I was really lucky, I'd forget some of them <laugh>. But you know, I set that up, whereas sitting down to play with, with like you and Tom Hamer and Mark Hendrickson the Quartet, I have no idea what you guys are gonna do. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3724.9" data-end_ts="3725.02" title="3724.9" id=c_"3724.9">__And__</span> that it fulfills that same, it meets that same need. Now does that mean I can do the same thing over again? No, not really. But, and that may be the reason why the Grammy nominations have been few and far between <laugh>, but, but you know, that's okay. That's fine. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, Gregory, boy, there's so much stuff here. I, we didn't get a chance to talk about your work with the Galon. Oh. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Or Sonology. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Or Sonology. I really wanted to <span style="color:red" data-ts="3753.66" data-end_ts="3753.78" title="3753.66" id=c_"3753.66">__dive__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3753.78" data-end_ts="3753.9" title="3753.78" id=c_"3753.78">__in__</span> into that. Cause I don't even know really what that means. I just heard 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>About it. I can do that for you in 30 seconds. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, you know what though? I don't want to do a 32nd version of it, so, okay. I'll tell you what, let's plan on getting back together again in a couple of weeks and Okay. Literally exploring that, kind of in its own episode. Sound good? All 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Right. If that's, if that's okay with everybody. I mean, for those of you out there listening, I promise it'll be a very different kind of discussion than the one that, than the ranty stuff that I've just 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, but this is, this is really great because, the fact of the matter is, another thing to me that the internet isn't really good at is it isn't, it isn't good a good, medium for understanding people's well thought out decision making process, right? <laugh>, you either get to hear the rant and you just assume somebody's a crazy old coot or else you hear completely bland stuff because people don't want to, they don't want to offend anyone. So we get the either the most bland of things or, or a complete Unibomber style <span style="color:red" data-ts="3822.32" data-end_ts="3822.54" title="3822.32" id=c_"3822.32">__ran__</span>. And so, well, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3824.58" data-end_ts="3824.66" title="3824.58" id=c_"3824.58">__I__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>You know, yeah, I think it's, I think that you always worry about offending people, but the other part of it, to me, and this to me has been one of the successes of your podcast. Like, when I think of, I was really nervous about doing this because I've heard probably everyone you've done so far, and the thing that I wound up thinking about when I leave that, when I leave the good ones is, you know, something about the person, even if you, if you didn't know their work, you know something about them. If you know their work, their work is, embedded in some way, right? And it's embedded in the idea that there's this person who cares, cares about what they do. And even if you're talking to people who are talking about something that's peculiar to you, if you can get people to talk about what they love, then you can kind of get a sense of what it might be like for you to love the thing that they talk about. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's true. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>And that to me has been the great thing that that, that this podcast to me personally as a listener has done over and over and over. Well, thank you. People that I think I know even, you know, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I appreciate you saying that. It definitely is a labor of love for me, but it's also one of those things where I, I truly can say that, after every, after every conversation that I have, I come away not only, knowing that person better, but I also tend to learn something about myself as well. Whether it's a reaction to something that they said or a recognition of a parallel life or whatever. I always, I always find, find ways to learn to, to come out of it. What I at least hope is a better person than when I went in so 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Well, so perhaps afu the future promise of a discussion about things like, looking at programs like the Institute for Sonology in the Netherlands, which is, woefully underappreciated, I think, in the history of electronic music. And also looking at the collisions between electronic and experimental music and non-western traditions. Yeah. You know what, I think those are really crucial and personally interesting to me, and I think they might be interesting to other people as as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I think so too. Yeah. So we'll plan on doing that, soon. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Okay. I hope so. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, thank you so much for your time. I really appreciate it and this was a fascinating conversation. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Thanks a lot. I don't think I went where I thought we might go, but it felt like a pretty great trip 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Actually. Yeah, it did. It did indeed. All right. So thanks a lot and I'll talk to you soon. Okay, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Take care. Bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and there's another one in the books. I want to thank Gregory for spending the time to chat with me. It was a lot of fun. Really kind of explored some outlier territory there, which is always a good time. Again, I want to thank all the listeners for sticking in there. Had some great listenership this last week. Do me a favor though, if you have some friends that haven't been turned onto it yet, drop 'em <span style="color:red" data-ts="4019.34" data-end_ts="4019.38" title="4019.34" id=c_"4019.34">__a__</span> line and say, Hey, check out this podcast. There's some really interesting people getting interviewed or converse with, as I prefer to say otherwise. Thanks a lot for your time and I will talk to you next week. 
</p>
