<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today I get a chance to get to talk to somebody whose work I've been following for a little while. I was originally turned <span style="color:red" data-ts="19.205" data-end_ts="19.405" title="19.205" id=c_"19.205">__on__</span> him by my friend Tom Hall. And then I got a chance to go to a gig last winter and I see him perform, and it was even better than I could have expected. And, then I've been listening, kind of obsessive obsessively ever since. It's been really some really amazing music. And the more I get to know about him, the more interesting stuff I find out. So, with this, I am going to introduce you to Benjamin Wynn. He often goes by the artist named Deru. And, if you know what that means, you know why I'm excited about this interview. So with that, I'm gonna say hello to Benjamin. Hey, how's it going, Ben? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin Wynn (Deru): </b>Hello. Thanks for that intro. That was really nice. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, I appreciate, I really appreciate your work, man. I've, I've really been drawn into it in a really neat way. And it's the kind of thing that I like because it really supports like long form listening. So, especially like the album 1979, which I know it seems to have an ever-growing life for you, but, that's become mm-Hmm. A real constant play on, on the system for me. So, great work there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>Wow. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But, you Thank 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>You, thank you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You, you do like a million things. I mean, I, as I started kind of doing a little background looking, I was shocked to see the number of things you did. So rather than me trying to explain <laugh> who you are and what you do, let me have you kind of lay it out for us. All right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>Yeah, I do, I do a number of things, as you said. I make artistic music under the name Deru, and that's, you know, as you said, long form albums and, and, and more and more of these conceptual album ideas or sort of experiences that, that have object and some sort of stories behind them. Then I do film and TV composition. I do film and TV, sound design. I'm involved with a group of Los Angeles based composers called the Echo Society. We get, get together about once a year and we write new pieces of music for a predetermined, instrumentation. And then we premiere them at these like singular sort of concert events with lights and visuals and all, all kinds of stuff. And then I am a label owner along with two other people of a record label called 79 Ancestors. And we, we've released one project so far, which is a VR release, and we have another couple in the pipeline, which are conceptual object based releases. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. This idea of an object based release is kind of interesting because, somewhere I read something that the 1979 album was actually originally put out as a sculptural object, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>Yeah. We released that on a handheld pico projector <laugh>. So the idea was that somebody could buy one, get it home, turn it on, and the album would beam to their walls, you know, they could turn down the lights, get in bed at the ceiling, and the album will, the projector will turn on and there's a video for each song, and it will play an order. And there's a, there's a whole sort of experiential aspect to it. We definitely made it like a sculptural object and we treated it kind of like a modern day time capsule, I guess, in terms of the content on there. Sure. And we made 50 of 'em and, yeah, we sold 50 of 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Them. Oh, cool. When you say we are you talking about the label? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>So that was, when I say we, in that case, I'm talking about myself and Anthony C. Mayo, who is a longtime collaborator at this point, and he is one of my, label owners in <span style="color:red" data-ts="251.585" data-end_ts="251.805" title="251.585" id=c_"251.585">__Ion__</span> ancestors, and he's the visual artist for Eco Society, so. Got it. He's definitely all around. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. Yeah. Well, tell me a little bit more about this VR based release, because I mean, VR is kind of on the tip of everybody's tongue right now anyway. What is it that you did that was specifically VR oriented, and how is it that you have a release that you can call VR without like telling everyone they have an Oculus Rift first? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>Right. So the, the first release on our label 79 a <span style="color:red" data-ts="289.275" data-end_ts="289.565" title="289.275" id=c_"289.275">__with__</span> a is a compilation. So we got eight of our friends and people that we admire to contribute a song for this compilation, it's called Territories. And then we paired up these, musicians with directors and coders and set about starting to make some VR experiences for the music. And so far we've released one, which is <span style="color:red" data-ts="315.545" data-end_ts="315.765" title="315.545" id=c_"315.545">__Cha__</span> Ghetto and an artist named Connor. And that just got released via within the app within. Okay. So that one is actually available, on all of the platforms. So it's available, you know, via your phone and Google Cardboard and Oculus Rift and you know, the vi. And so it, it's pretty widely distributed, that one. But we also, you know, I mean our, our, when we were first starting, we were planning on doing a Google Cardboard release only Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b><affirmative> and Google Cardboard is a very inexpensive sort of every man way to experience vr. And we, we were kind of excited about it because we could play up the sort of lo-fi aspect of it. Sure. I mean, I think VR is definitely in its early days right now. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So, you know, I tend to think that playing, you know, not playing to this idea that you wanna make everything super cinematic and expansive is necessarily the most successful way to do it, because I think the, the hardware is still like, pretty in its infancy, right? So we were kind of going on the idea that we could play up the roughness and low fineness and just make cool experiences. So we actually developed an app of our own that we were going to release all of these things on. But then, we showed within the shigeto, VR video and they got really excited. So we realized that was like a, a way to get it out in front of much many more people than us releasing it ourselves. And we did when we sold packages of Vinyl and go Google Cardboard viewers. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Got it. What's been the response so far? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>It's been really good. I think, you know, the people from within really loved it. It was, it was really great. We got, you know, Chris Milk who used to be at Google and was one of the owners of Within, was very, very excited about it. And I think all of them were very excited about as well, which is very nice. And then, yeah, it's been great. I mean, I think, everybody that's seen it has been really pumped on it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's cool. That's really neat. And it's neat direction to go for label because the way <span style="color:red" data-ts="443.725" data-end_ts="443.925" title="443.725" id=c_"443.725">__that__</span> digital distribution and stuff has worked, kind of a standard label has lost some of it's, some of it's driving reason to be Right. But if, if all of a sudden you end up being almost like a combination of artistic curator and ship shipping gallery <laugh>, right. That seems to, that seems to make a lot of sense. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>Yeah. I mean, you know, our model if, if we have one for <span style="color:red" data-ts="470.005" data-end_ts="470.445" title="470.005" id=c_"470.005">__<inaudible>__</span> is that we want to extend the music past just the music into some other art form and into, you know, more of an experiential medium. That it's all, it's all around the music and the fact that we really wanna promote people having an experience with music, again, we feel like that's somewhat been lost in the digital age, of the MP three age. So, you know, we're just trying to do these things that will get people back to experiencing music in a new way or a different way, or just like a more focused way. And so we we're aiming to be a label full of musicians and artists and coders and CNC manufacturers and, you know, all these people that can, that do amazing things, but aren't just musicians. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. Well, that's, that's kind of neat though. And, and it's also something that sort of like works well with, I don't know, the modern experience, which is that given the opportunity to poop out some music, a lot of people can do that. How do you make something, how do you engage people enough so that they'll go beyond shrugging their shoulders and actually engage with, with you as an artist? That's, that's really smart play. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>Totally. I mean, I think that there's so much music now and, and the world is so saturated with, with music and with options that it seems like people now really respond to bigger ideas. You know, it's like the, the bigger idea you have and the more people you involve in it, and, the more ways people can enter it, I think is definitely to your advantage. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, indeed. So now the other, the other side of it, so that's talking about kind of these focused releases through a labels a label system that you've, you've developed the kind of, like the total flip on the other side is your work as a composer for, for TV and film. And, yeah. You've, you've got, you've built quite a reputation of that going back quite, quite a long time. I mean, you were involved in a, in a team called the Track team that, really got a lot of play in, in terms of like getting Emmy nominations and whole bit, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>Yeah, so that was, myself and a good friend of mine, Jeremy Zuckerman, and we met at Cal Arts where we were both studying electronic music. I mean, <laugh>, the way it all happened was that I was living with Brian Ksko, one of the co-creators of Avatar at the last Airbender Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And he was working at Nickelodeon and <span style="color:red" data-ts="623.925" data-end_ts="624.125" title="623.925" id=c_"623.925">__went__</span> on <span style="color:red" data-ts="624.325" data-end_ts="624.405" title="624.325" id=c_"624.325">__a__</span> show he, was working on finished, and they asked him if he wanted to pitch an idea. So he and his friend Mike DiMartino got together and, you know, within two weeks they came up with this bible for Avatar last Airbender and presented it. And, Nickelodeon loved it. And he came home one day and he was like, well, do you want to do it? And, and I was like, sure. And he was like, no, seriously, it's, it's gonna change your life. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>Like, are you sure you want to do this? And I was like, sure. <laugh>. So yeah, so Jeremy and I, formed a company. The idea initially was that, you know, we were gonna do the music and the sound design together. We were gonna do it all like that, which didn't pan out. I mean, we, we really like realized we had to specialize pretty early on for that series. So, I mean, we were, I think I was 24 years old and it was, you know, a pretty unique hire for Nickelodeon. So we had, I think, a lot to prove in that regard. Anyway, we, we did it, we did like three seasons, you know, in his garage. I was on headphones and, and it was great. So, so Jeremy focused on the music for that, and I focused on the sound design for that. And that's really why, you know, I've done sound design actually, is because of that show. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="699.105" data-end_ts="699.325" title="699.105" id=c_"699.105">__Oh__</span>, that's interesting. What a great entry too. I mean, it was kind of talking to my family before this call, and I mentioned that you had worked on that, and they were like, well, we know every squeak and every sound that that guy made then, because <laugh>, they were a little bit obsessive about watching it. So I have family that, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>Yeah. I mean, we were, you know, we were lucky in that it was, it was really great. A great show. Yeah. I mean, it had a, it had a ton of heart and the, the writing was phenomenal. So it was the artwork and really everything was it, you know, Brian and Mike, they, they set about really hiring all of their friends to work on it. And that was really inspiring to me because I, I'd never seen that, and I really haven't since really, I mean, you know, I know people that hire some of their friends to do things, but they really like tried to fill out the whole production with friends and friends that they thought were talented and could do it even if they hadn't done it before. You know, it's pretty, pretty amazing. Like us, you know, Jeremy and I had never scored any, you know, we'd never scored television. We'd never done sound design for television, <laugh>, Brian just, you know, heard my music or Jeremy's music and, knew that we could do it. So, so we did it, and it was a great thing to be a part of. And, and then that led to, us we both did the music for Kung Fu Panda for the TV show for Nickelodeon. Right. And then a couple years after that, we did the sequel legend of Chorus for Nickelodeon. And that, you know, that spanned like 10 years of my life, which was crazy. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Unbelievable. Well, what a, what a cool story, but, and what a, what a great way to get an introduction into the industry is literally by working with friends. That's pretty cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>I know, I know. The only rude awakening part was after that, I was like, wait, you know, my friends don't always like storm out of boardrooms and threaten to quit if they don't hire me. This is crazy. I don't get it. <laugh> <laugh>, you know, like, it, it was, it was, you know, amazing to have friends be that loyal. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>But, you know, having that happen first, it's been, it's been interesting that like, it's know, most of the time I get the like, yeah, you know, like, they really wanna hire you, but we're getting some pushback from the studio or something like that. And then you're like, well, you should storm out of the office. You know, you should storm 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Outta the building. <laugh>, it worked before. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>I've seen it done. It <span style="color:red" data-ts="834.245" data-end_ts="834.365" title="834.245" id=c_"834.245">__worked__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's right. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>But it's hard to do that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Indeed. So one of <span style="color:red" data-ts="839.085" data-end_ts="839.165" title="839.085" id=c_"839.085">__the__</span> things I like talking to people about in my podcast is how they got started or doing what they do. And, and I want to talk a little bit more about some of the other stuff, particularly the Eco Society. But here you've got, you've got this artistic side, you've got this kind of developer creator side with the label. You've got the music editing and sound design work that you did for TV and for film and all of these things and, and the, the orchestra stuff you're doing with Eco Society. How in the heck do you get started in a life that ends up taking you there that, you got a <span style="color:red" data-ts="875.485" data-end_ts="875.645" title="875.485" id=c_"875.485">__pile__</span> of talent or experience or something somewhere where, where did that all come from? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>So I, yeah. Growing up I played trumpet and piano, sort of like very uninspired, you know, I don't know, it kind of by rote, I guess. I, I would say, like I was in bands and I would take private lessons, and I was never really that passionate about either of those things. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I, I could do them. It was, you know, it was just like someone tells you how to do it and you do it, and that's kind of, it's just an activity, or it was at that time. Sure. But then I actually, I got really into hip hop and <span style="color:red" data-ts="910.525" data-end_ts="910.725" title="910.525" id=c_"910.525">__then__</span>, and I got the first musical thing I was very passionate about, was it being a dj. And then I eventually got an AKA MPC 2000 <laugh>, and that, that really blew my mind open. The fact that I could take a sound and pitch it down an octave and it sounded amazing and crazy, and then I could construct whole pieces of music that I could share with people. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>I think it was the combination. It, it was really two things. I think it was technology and it was technology that allowed me to manipulate sound. And I think that sound manipulation has been one of the biggest factors in, in my pursuit of everything, like including music. Yeah. Anyway, so I got a, a <span style="color:red" data-ts="959.925" data-end_ts="960.125" title="959.925" id=c_"959.925">__Kai__</span> MPC, and that, blew my mind. And then eventually I got some computer programs. <span style="color:red" data-ts="966.645" data-end_ts="966.765" title="966.645" id=c_"966.645">__I__</span> think I got a really early version of Cubase, and I would use that to sequence myki. And then I discovered that you could study electronic music <laugh>, and that really blew my mind as well. So I, I took a summer course at Oberlin, actually, and Gary Lee Nelson showed me Max MSP. Oh, <span style="color:red" data-ts="987.805" data-end_ts="988.005" title="987.805" id=c_"987.805">__okay__</span>. I remember. And that I thought was incredible. And, you know, I remember like, we were making songs in the studio and recording to DATs and, and, you know, and that one of the instructors that, one of the student instructors was about to go to this place that she told me about, called Cal Arts. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>And she was gonna get her master's in electronic music. So I went home and I looked up Cal Arts, and I was just like, I gotta go here. So I visited the school and the dean of the school walked me around all day and, the dean of the music school Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, and, had lunch with me, and I was just like, this is it. This is, this is where I need to go. So I applied and got in, you know, I applied with all the like MPC sort of <laugh>, abstract beats that I was making and stuff like that. Right. And I got in, and that again, really opened up my perception. And it, it just blew apart everything I knew about music and really exposed me to so much more. And, you know, we studied sound synthesis and psychoacoustics and world music, and I had to do piano and composition and ear training and, you know, everything. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>I, I really loved Cal Arts. It was, it was an incredibly creative place. And, you know, you could leave a class and they would've flown in some master musician from India, and he's playing the tabla in the main, the main hall. So you can sort of like watch for 20 minutes as you go to lunch. And then you, you know, the next day it's an African ensemble. And I was in the Galon ensemble. And, so I would say that that, that was really the first experience I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1087.245" data-end_ts="1087.365" title="1087.245" id=c_"1087.245">__had__</span> that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1087.565" data-end_ts="1087.925" title="1087.565" id=c_"1087.565">__experie__</span> really expanded my mu not only my musical taste, but my ability to express myself. Yeah. And that actually really widened, as I said, the kinds of music that I was listening to. I mean, when I got there, I was listening to pretty much hip hop and sort of like making abstract DJ crush or DJ shadow style beats. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>And then after I left, it was, I was into sort of everything I was into, I was into electronic music, I was into classical music. I was into world music and galon and, you know, African drumming and all these, and all these things. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So it really, expanded everything that I was doing. And then simultaneously I got a job when I was still in school working at a music house in Hollywood that was doing a lot of commercials and that kind of stuff. Okay. So the very first commercial I ever did, like, I, I remember getting a check for like 1400 bucks. 'cause I made background music for an at t commercial. And I, my mind was just blown <laugh> again, I was just, I was like, wait, you can make this much money making music. This is insane. You know? 'cause I think back then the idea of an electronic musician, was not a mainstream idea. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>Right. And it was not, it didn't appear to me to be a very viable career path at, at the time. It was back in, back then, you know, if you told somebody you made electronic music, they're like, oh, like techno, you know, and you're like, well, no, not really. Or, you know, if you say you're playing live, they're like, oh, you're DJing. You know? <span style="color:red" data-ts="1183.845" data-end_ts="1183.965" title="1183.845" id=c_"1183.845">__Right__</span>. Like, nobody, nobody really understood in, in a mass way what, what I was really doing. Or at least that's how it felt. So after I graduated, then I did, you know, I did freelancing for some production houses that I'd met doing music for commercials and industrials and, all kinds of like, commercial things. And then, then avatar happened. Interesting. And then all that while I was, you know, working on my own electronic music and releasing it and doing that kind of stuff. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So I'm curious then, once you got the gig at Airbender, though, one of the, one of the things that I've noticed in people that get drawn into like quote the industry Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, is that a lot of times that consumes them to the point that their artistic work kind of shuts off. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>Yeah, for 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. How did, how did you prevent yourself from going down that rabbit hole? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>That's a hard, question to answer because I've thought about that, because I have witnessed that happen a lot. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and I, and I'm not sure that what makes me unique, other than the fact that I felt very, very passionate about my artistic music. Like my <span style="color:red" data-ts="1256.925" data-end_ts="1257.005" title="1256.925" id=c_"1256.925">__elect__</span> my own electronic music. I mean, you know, typically if you're working on any production that is someone else's, you know, if, if you are working in a scoring or sound design capacity, it's really kind of the service industry, right? You are servicing, this other production and these other people's ideas, even if they're great. Like Avatar, Cora and Kungfu <span style="color:red" data-ts="1279.845" data-end_ts="1280.005" title="1279.845" id=c_"1279.845">__Panel__</span>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1280.005" data-end_ts="1280.165" title="1280.005" id=c_"1280.005">__Those__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1280.165" data-end_ts="1280.365" title="1280.165" id=c_"1280.165">__were__</span> all, those <span style="color:red" data-ts="1280.565" data-end_ts="1280.685" title="1280.565" id=c_"1280.565">__were__</span> all really good. But those ideas don't originate with me. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and I, I really like working in large collaborative formats, but I, but I also really like being in charge of everything and, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1291.845" data-end_ts="1292.165" title="1291.845" id=c_"1291.845">__working__</span> on my own ideas. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>And typically those are the ones that I'm most passionate about. You know, I think at the end of the day, those are the things that I'm most proud of. So even if I'm working on, you know, a TV show to be creatively fulfilled, I really kind of have to do my own projects. Right. At least to be 100% creatively fulfilled. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, you know, 1979, that album came together very quickly. And I was working on two TV shows at the same time. And I would dedicate, you know, an hour after working all day, I would just work for an hour on those songs. And many of 'em came together that quickly. And, you know, I recorded them over the span of like three days and, and, and they were done. And then I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1333.925" data-end_ts="1334.045" title="1333.925" id=c_"1333.925">__would__</span>, then I would spend like six to eight months, like going back to them and trying to make them better. And, and I couldn't. And actually, those, those songs I recorded live to, analog cassette <laugh>. So they were not easy to fix little things and to like, deconstruct or do anything like that. And, and very often, like nine times outta 10, that that very first recording was the one that that was 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Best. That's really interesting. Now, kind of continuing on this theme though, of like, how do you stay engaged with the artistic music? Do you have any, any tricks? Like, one of the things I know a lot of people are doing right now is, you know, their lives revolve around looking at or editing on or in some way dealing with a computer all day. And so Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> working away from the computer on their personal and artistic music is sort of like a way that they can break through a barrier. Right. Right. Do you have any, anything like that, that is sort of like your artistic barrier? Is there anything that you do that separates your artistic work from Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> your sound design work for film or for, for tv? I mean, do you use different gear or do you have a different room or? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>No, I don't. It's the same room, it's the same software. <laugh>, it's the same, it's the same everything. You know, I mean, I do have quite a mid-size modular setup that is kind of fun. But I actually am not very productive on it in terms of that's not where my music comes from. Okay. My music comes from software that I know very well, recording into it, manipulating it, and just working. I mean, that's the way I'm fastest. And that's, that's kind of what works for me. I mean, like, this, this new music I'm working on is Microtonal, or a large, a large number of the songs I've been working on are Microtonal Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And those pitches are derived from acoustic sounds. So the analysis of acoustic sounds. So I end up with very specific frequencies like down to like three decimal places. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>Those have, those are very precise. So those need to be digital and I need to do them on a computer. That being said, I mean, there's, there's so much, you know, I, I actually, I think to answer your question, one of the ways that I stay interested or finding new ideas is really by like, constantly playing with software and new software or learning software that I have better, like within the last year, I've been really diving into Maximus <span style="color:red" data-ts="1494.485" data-end_ts="1494.605" title="1494.485" id=c_"1494.485">__p__</span> way harder than, than I had in the past. And, you know, I've been using it for probably 10 years or something, but, or maybe 15 years. But just this last year, I've really kind of, my knowledge has grown a lot in it. 'cause I've been doing these larger projects because I've sort of, I've had to Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> like, you know, I use these tools when I have to really, like, when there's, when you have to solve problems and there are no other solutions that will Right. Allow you to, you, you know, you have to build it yourself. Yeah. You know, one of the ways I stay interested is, or find new ideas is by exploring software in a deeper way, or finding new software and playing with it and getting new ideas and, you know, like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That makes a lot of sense in that, I, I also like this idea of kind of exploring weird corners in the software you have. I guess I always feel like one of the things I tend to do a lot for myself is find like improbable things to do, or like areas of a piece of software that I don't know anything about. So recently I wanted to kind of jump out of something and so I was, I was like, you know, I'd never used the audio to midi functions enabled in live. So I'm gonna try playing around with that and see what kind of ridiculous foolishness I can get out of it. And it was great. Yeah. 'cause it did a bunch of stuff and then I started manipulating the samples to see how I could make it even worse. And it was great. And then next thing you know, I am just like, whatever rabbit hole I felt like I was in, I was out of it and, and felt super productive at that moment was really cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>Yeah. Yeah. I agree. I mean, essentially I think that for me, starting music is the hardest part. Uhhuh <affirmative>, I'm, I'm generally pretty good at finishing stuff. One of the things that I like to do is that at any given time, I have kind of like a, a mental list in my head of things. I want to explore Uhhuh <affirmative>. It could be preparing my piano and playing with that and recording it. Or it could be, you know, messing with that new wave table synthesizer. Or it could be exploring Jen and Poly and MXP, and as long as I have this like, list going, then I can just pull from it and start. And that, that really tends to work for me. I have a friend that's a painter and she said, you know, the scariest thing for her is looking at a blank canvas. So she'll take her hand, dip it in paint, and just stick it on the canvas <laugh>, because then she has something to fix. Right. And you have somewhere to start. And, and for me that's awesome. It's kind of similar. Like, I, I just need a seed. I need something to go on. And that could be conceptual, it could be technical, it could be musical. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. So having started on the MPC, are you still drawn into hardware, like hardware samplers and stuff? Or are you really pretty much working in the box now? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>The only hardware that I have now are things that change sound in a really nice way. Like I have a, a tube equalizer that I use a lot that has a bunch of tubes and you can really distort it and the sound is amazing. Sure. Some other hardware distortion stuff. I do have quite a lot of hardware synthesizers that I kind of, honestly, I kind of like go in waves. I fall in and out of using a lot. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Sometimes I use 'em all the time, sometimes I never use them. But, you know, I would say 90% of of everything I do is, is software. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now you said something that really intrigues me because very, I've met very few people who have said this. You said that you find it relatively easy to finish a project. Yeah. And that's normally, that is normally the trap door that catches most people, A lot of people start stuff and either get bored or get confused, or just don't know when to stop. Yeah. You say you're good at it. Now with 1979, you still admit that you went back for eight or nine months to try and improve it. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But nevertheless, what is, how is it that you feel comfortable in saying something is done? How do you make that call 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>When the, like, law of diminishing returns kicks in and you can spend a whole day on something and you have to go back to the other version to see if you've made it any better, and sometimes you haven't. Yeah. You know, then I just kind of call it, or there's a release date and I have a mastering date and I kind of futz around with it until those dates and, and then I, you know, see how it's gonna sound after mastering. And then it's like, okay, that's great. I'm done. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, do you ever push yourself with dates? Do you ever artificially lay dates out there just so you'll get your ass done? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>I, I haven't done that too much. But you know, for this next album I have coming out, I know when it's coming out roughly. And so now I know how long it takes to make vinyl, and so I know when it needs to be mastered, you know? Got it. Sure. Those things back up a lot, you know, so it's not like, I mean, I could do that right now. I could set a date and just say it's done. But I tend to be a little more natural about it because I do, I do find that sometimes even changing something 5% is like, what's gonna make me feel really good about it. Like I, you know, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1796.765" data-end_ts="1797.005" title="1796.765" id=c_"1796.765">__solved__</span> that one annoying frequency that happens at two minutes, 37 seconds and, you know, just kind of, I don't think I'm a perfectionist, but I can probably be obsessive about certain things. Sure. But I mean, I think the reason that I'm, that I'm good at finishing things is because it just becomes much more obvious what I have to do. And then it's just about work. It's just about putting in hours to get there. Right. So in the beginning it can be anything. It can be hard for me to figure out what it should be in the beginning because there's endless possibilities and, you know, everything is perfect when it lives in your head. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>So, but then once you have the idea and once you know where it's going, then it's really just about putting in the hours and, and it's much less of a mental game. It's much more of like a physical game. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Now for, what are some of the things that you do that are the equivalent of sticking your hand in Peyton, slapping it on the canvas? What are, what are the starter tools for you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>There's many ways, but I have, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1856.425" data-end_ts="1856.645" title="1856.425" id=c_"1856.425">__by__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1856.725" data-end_ts="1856.845" title="1856.725" id=c_"1856.725">__a__</span>, a folder on my hard drive called Sounds that I've kept for 20 years that just has, you know, whenever I find a new interesting sound, I'll just throw it in there. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, or when I generate and manipulate sounds, I'll throw the results in there. So there's just this huge grab bag of sounds in there. You know, some are just interesting source material and some are like, pretty polished, manipulated sounds. So that's the grab bag that's always there. But, but again, I probably one of the more like obsessive things I do is that I have an RSS reader that, and I subscribe to all of the, like, music update sites, like KVR and, gear, gear Junkies, is that what it's called? Anyway, another one where they basically like every day I look at it and I'll say, oh, they updated this <span style="color:red" data-ts="1906.165" data-end_ts="1906.325" title="1906.165" id=c_"1906.165">__syn__</span>, or this company has just released this software. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>And so I get those kind of delivered to me every day. If I see something that's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1913.605" data-end_ts="1913.725" title="1913.605" id=c_"1913.605">__like__</span>, looks interesting, I'll bookmark it and I'll try it out. Right. Like, like I'm not one of these artists that, you know, I, I know people that make amazing music and they use 99% the stock Ableton plugins. Right. Like, I am not that person, like, at all. Interesting. I own hundreds and hundreds of plugins, and I'm constantly looking for more and demoing some and looking for some that do it better. And so that's another way. Another way is just, you know, having instruments around me. Like I have a, a piano that I got last year that is, it's an upright midi piano. Okay. It's an acoustic midi piano. Right. So I've slowly and but surely been working on piano music, for that. But it's like prepared and sequenced by software. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So I have these like projects that are just kind of laying in the background in terms of, and I know like, you know, I'll be, I'll kind of like, I've assembled a list of different kinds of tape I want to try on that, and like, I'll get 'em delivered from Amazon, you know, and so I'll just go down and try it out. And so I just kind of like staying tinkering with sound. Yeah. I mean, I'm pretty, like, I'm pretty fucking obsessive when it comes to that kind of stuff. Like if I'm not in my studio, I have my laptop out and I'm either exploring software or I'm reading about software <laugh> or reading about music or, you know, I am pretty much doing it constantly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, I hear that. So do you ever do anything, it sounds like almost everything that kicks you off is, is vectored by Sound. Do you ever, do you ever do anything like, you know, there's a lot of people that use like cards, like either the oblique strategies or other card games or dice or anything like that for like compositional ideas? Or, or does the sounds kind of kick it in for you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>I don't, yeah. I mean, the, the way I originally started making music is, it's pretty similar to the way I do it now, although it's probably more sophisticated now. But really I would just kind of let, like, let the sound tell me what it wants to do or, you know, like follow a path and see where it leads. And, I think that's pretty much how I do it now. I mean, one of the reasons that I've been really excited about Microtonal music is that it removes the baggage of Western tonality. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I do, and there is a ton of baggage for me at least surrounding rest Western tonality in that it's been done forever. And I always feel like, you know, I, there there's a different solution that I just should need to explore more and I'll find a better chord change or, you know, a better, voice leading or, you know, I, I just, you know, I always feel like I'm trying to adhere to rules that someone has made for me. Yeah. You know, they're there because they by and large work, and that's great. You know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2091.085" data-end_ts="2091.285" title="2091.085" id=c_"2091.085">__you__</span>, I need to learn, you know, everyone needs to know those and, and learn them <span style="color:red" data-ts="2094.525" data-end_ts="2094.725" title="2094.525" id=c_"2094.525">__or__</span> whatever. But micro tonality really divorces me from that. And you can really follow sound more so it becomes more gestural and textural. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's interesting you say that because the way that you talked about, sort of like western tonality is the way that I always think that mathematicians talk about being mathematicians. You know, you'll work for nine months on something only to find out that it was first invented in the 15 hundreds. Right. <laugh>. Right. You know? Right. There's such a long history that it's difficult to actually innovate. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>I mean, and to be fair though, I am, actually the, the microphone music that I am pursuing right now has a lineage as well. It was started in the eighties at Ear Cam, and it's, it's somewhat in the fashion of spectral music. Interesting. Which is, it, it is basically just something I stumbled upon when reading and, and it, it just like, once again, blew my mind. And I felt like I had found my clan in some ways because, because I really like centering and focusing electronic music around acoustic and organic sounds, Uhhuh <affirmative>. And I, and I love the idea in spectrum music that you start with an acoustic sound and you analyze it and you break it apart into, its, into its partials, into its harmonic content. And then that becomes the basis for new music that you can reorchestrate however you want, or resynthesize however you want. You could do it electronically, which I've done. You could do it acoustically, which I've done. And it's really just a different system for writing music. But what's great is that it's microtonal but it has a system so that it sounds, it sounds like it is meant to be, it doesn't sound random. Right. It doesn't sound made up. It just sounds very other. And, and, and it can sound very dark. And I, and I love both of those things. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, kind of building on that and also building on some of your other work that we haven't talked about, I want to talk really briefly about, or really quickly about the Eco Society, because this is Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> sort of like your opportunity to engage with actual acoustic instruments. It's, it's literally, it's orchestra work that's performed by an actual orchestra, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>Correct. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's been, it's been this really incredible, almost like gift that I feel like I'm, I'm a part of. Yeah, it started with Seven Friends and we're all composers and you know, most of us are film TV composers, some are electronic, musicians. But anyway, we were going to classical shows together just for fun. And at one point we just like got a little, not disillusioned, but we were like, you know, we, we saw a show that wasn't great, and we were just like, ah, maybe we should, like, maybe we should try to do this. We should just, not that we can necessarily do it better, but that we could do it differently in that we could make it kind of underground and fun and have, serve drinks, have there be a visual show, integrate electronics, have there be a sound system, but write new, you know, orchestral hybrid music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, and have, as you said, live, live instruments, perform it. So that's what we did. So we decided upon instrumentation, we booked a venue, got our friends do lighting and sound, and made a flyer and sold tickets, and we sold out. And so we're like, the energy was just amazing in there, and it seemed like people were excited and wanted to engage in hearing new music and hearing live instruments play the music. I think, you know, the audience that we have had isn't necessarily the same audience that like goes to the La Phil on a, on a Wednesday night. Right. You know, it's, it's people kind of more like us, like younger and artistic and people that go to see, you know, electronic and rock shows, but not necessarily classical shows. Interesting. So we did that show sold out, and then we just kind of kept on going. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>And, you know, we went from like 300 tickets to last year we did the Ace, which was 1600 tickets. And, it's, it's just, it, it's wild. I mean, there are, I've been involved with a few things, and luckily in my life that have just, just have a lot of energy behind them for whatever reason. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I feel like that's one of 'em. So I'm incredibly happy to be part of it. But in <span style="color:red" data-ts="2358.965" data-end_ts="2359.085" title="2358.965" id=c_"2358.965">__terms__</span> creatively, it's exactly like you said. I mean, I, I always think of it as an opportunity to try things that I haven't tried before and to experiment, and to try new things in a way where there's like enough pressure, you know, it's like sink or swim, you know, because like that first, that first concert we had, I had never written concert music before <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>And it's like, so that's terrifying on its own. And then it's like, oh, yeah, by the way, we're inviting every music supervisor in town, every head of all of our agencies, <laugh>, film executives, directors, every friend that you <laugh> have in Los Angeles, like, they're all gonna be there, which is terrifying. But I think that often you really need that fear to, to push you forward sometimes. Right. And so, yeah. So it has been this incredible opportunity for me to learn about acoustic instruments, you know, in a more in depth way and write for them and collaborate with musicians. And I think it's absolutely had an effect on my own artistic music as well. Like, this album I have coming out is a series of Microtonal pieces that I spoke about, but it's also a series of woodwind quintet recordings that, so I wrote for, for this ensemble and then highly processed 'em. And so it's, it's a collection of those two kinds of, of pieces. Very interesting. But, so, yeah. So, and you know, and the amazing thing is like all of those musicians are people that I've met through the Echo Society and, you know, they're now friends, so. Right. It's been really great. And the other aspect is just kind of building a community and doing things with your friends and, seeing what happens. It's, it's really powerful. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So when you're, when you're writing for the Echo Society and, and stuff's gonna be performed in <span style="color:red" data-ts="2462.845" data-end_ts="2463.045" title="2462.845" id=c_"2462.845">__concert__</span> concert, what, how is that different from the kinds of things that you would do in music for a film or something? Is there a different thinking process because you know it's gonna be a concert performance? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>Yeah, I mean, I, I think now I, I, I approach that a couple different ways. One is I try to think about the audience and do interesting maybe psychoacoustic things for them. Like, like this, this last piece was for four percussionists that surrounded the audience, and then each percussionist had a break drum, a snare drum, a bass drum, and a symbol. And then I had prerecorded those sounds and analyzed them, and then they each had a speaker by each station, and I was spitting out the actual partials of the instruments they were playing. So anyway, so that was like this spatial performance, Uhhuh <affirmative>. So that's, that's one way. I've also done some live processing. So that's, that's another way. Yeah. I mean, again, I tend to think about it more in terms of experimenting and pushing myself to try something I haven't tried before. Probably more than the fact that it's gonna be performed live or, or Got it. I don't <span style="color:red" data-ts="2530.485" data-end_ts="2530.525" title="2530.485" id=c_"2530.485">__know__</span>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2530.525" data-end_ts="2530.565" title="2530.525" id=c_"2530.525">__Or__</span> maybe those are, those are happening at the same time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it sounds though like, too, like you're, you're actually kind of generating an audience that's gonna be open for a little experimentation too. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>Yeah. I mean, I think one of our strengths is that we're a very diverse group of composers. You know, we're not like all making the exact same kind of music. We didn't start putting on these concerts because we have the exact same taste in music. In fact, we have a pretty diverse taste in music. And I think that that is to our benefit in that, you know, an audience member, if you ask any person there, they're gonna say someone, someone else's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2562.005" data-end_ts="2562.205" title="2562.005" id=c_"2562.005">__pieces__</span> piece was their favorite. You know, they're each gonna have a different answer for that. Interesting. So, yeah, I mean, I'm really happy that we've created this platform where like, I can do this kind of like academic spectral piece right next to the hacks <span style="color:red" data-ts="2574.085" data-end_ts="2574.205" title="2574.085" id=c_"2574.085">__and__</span> Cloak or Clark or, you know, some electronic performer writing a piece right next to something that's very classical and next to something that's like more from the film world. And, you know, we've created, I think this stage where, as you said, people are pretty open to what we're gonna present, and it's not, it's not as much based on genre. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, Ben, I I really appreciate you taking the time. I, I have like 50 other questions I'd love to ask you, but unfortunately our time is up. But before you go, there's one last thing that I wanted to ask you, and, and that is about your live performance. I was lucky enough to see a performance this last January, where you were one of the performers and it was, it was really great. You did a excellent set. You had, great visuals working with you. I'm wondering, when you do a Deru set, how much, first of all, do you interact with the person that's doing visuals with you? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, because it seemed to be a really tight collaboration, what I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2629.725" data-end_ts="2629.885" title="2629.725" id=c_"2629.725">__see__</span>. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Right, right. But secondly, what do you use, what do you use to bring your, like extraordinary music? How do you bring that on stage? What do you use for, for kind of a live rig that allows you to do this kind of complex stuff on stage, but still have enough control that you feel like you're performing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>Yeah. That's, that's an ever evolving question. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, for the 1979 tour, and, and I tend to do shows now really kind of based around record releases and therefore that I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2658.585" data-end_ts="2659.005" title="2658.585" id=c_"2658.585">__design__</span> these shows with Anthony around these releases. And then we sort of tore that show. So for 1979, the visuals and the music were, were very, very much connected. And I performed, or Anthony both on stage and we performed behind a, a large scrim. And then we were on a table in the middle with lights that, that Anthony could activate hitting us. And then behind us there was another projection surface. And for that, you know, and that, that, that tour was the 1979 album, which is ambient music. So, you know, I felt like it needed a strong visual component and that we, we did mostly sit down shows, so it was very experiential. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>And for that, I had a laptop and a small modular rig and an iPad running lemur. Interesting. And then it <span style="color:red" data-ts="2709.045" data-end_ts="2709.125" title="2709.045" id=c_"2709.045">__was__</span> like a, a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2709.765" data-end_ts="2709.965" title="2709.765" id=c_"2709.765">__Kai__</span> controller. Got it. But for this new tour that, we'll, we're gonna design, I've been, I've spent probably like six months working on this Max <span style="color:red" data-ts="2718.765" data-end_ts="2719.085" title="2718.765" id=c_"2718.765">__Patch__</span> because, you know, in order for me to present and to play this microtonal music in a way that feels live, I had to basically build it in, in max because the way I constructed a lot of this record is using MPE or like the Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> midi note per channel protocol, which is very new, and therefore you kind of like, there's all these workarounds you have to do. Right. And one is that Ableton Live doesn't allow for it, like at all. Right. So I've built this Max Patch that basically plays back all of these MIDI files and then I can slow down the tempo so all of the synthesis is created live, and then I can slow down the tempo and then the, like the pitch bends and the after touch are all presented on an iPad and I can play, you know, the Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>Play back and manipulate these, these files. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, yeah. And I, I was just thinking of like, a lot of spectrum music also is like replete with tons and tons of parameters and so you almost need like helper functions to help you kind of, with a finite number of digits to be able to control 'em all too. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's a very like, data hungry right. Kind of, system. And, you know, it's, I think it's why it's taken me so long to build this patch and I'm, I'm like just at the place where I feel like it's stable and not that I can really perform with it. So I think that this, for this album cycle, I think it will be laptop controller, iPad, probably not too much like synthesis happening live in terms of hardware. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, but all happening in terms of software. And then, we'll be developing like a full audio visual show for it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. When, when is this likely to drop? When is the new album gonna be coming out, do you think? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>It is looking like March next year. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Fantastic. Yeah, I'll be looking forward to that. And looking forward to seeing you live again. That, sounds like that'll be a fascinating show. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>Well, thank you so much and thanks for, thanks for everything. It was really cool. I hope I didn't drone on for too long and take too much 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Time. <laugh>. No, it was fantastic. I really appreciate it. So with that, we'll say goodbye and, and talk again hopefully soon. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thank you.
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>See you.
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Many thanks to Benjamin for the talk. What a great and inspiring set of information makes me wanna run out and spend a little more time doing some spectral com compositions. Certainly makes me wanna create a sounds folder on my computer and start filling it up with stuff. So anyway, thanks much again to Benjamin, for talking with us. Thank you for listening. We keep on keeping on. I have a lot more good stuff in store for the next couple of weeks. Make sure that you're tuning in. Otherwise, I will catch you next time.
