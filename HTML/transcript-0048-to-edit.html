<b>Darwin: </b>So we're back. Thanks a lot for, indulging me while I took a weekend off. Just got back from Taos and boy, my chak retired, wah wah wah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Had a great week Besides the trip, back from Taos, or at Taos. And then back from Taos, I got a chance to meet with some friends, hang out a little bit, but also last night I got a chance to be involved in a bit of a salon type environment, put on by Michael Theodore, where I got to both be introduced and reintroduced to some work of, local people. That was really fun. I'll tell you if I could, offer any suggestions to you out there. It's to find ways to interact with your local, musicians, artists, whatever, because you'll find <span style="color:red" data-ts="55.5" data-end_ts="55.62" title="55.5" id=c_"55.5">__a__</span> almost bottomless well of inspiration from local folk. Without further ado, I now introduce you to this week's guest, Darius Segan. What a treat. I hope you enjoy. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>All right. This week, I am very excited, to have a chat with, Darius <span style="color:red" data-ts="79.38" data-end_ts="79.58" title="79.38" id=c_"79.38">__Sim__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="79.58" data-end_ts="79.86" title="79.58" id=c_"79.58">__again__</span>. She is, currently a professor at suny Stony Brook. She's got a long history of compositions. You, you can find some on, some of the streaming sites like Spotify. You <span style="color:red" data-ts="94.78" data-end_ts="94.9" title="94.78" id=c_"94.78">__could__</span> find others. I actually ran into some really neat stuff on, the Boom CATT distribution site. She's a really interesting, composer, first of all, because she has kind of composed across, much of the modern landscape, having, done some work back in the Columbia, Princeton electronic music studios, and having, worked, outside of that environment as well, having, worked in stone out of Stony Brook for quite some time, and, some really exciting work done there. But also, she has a long history of not only studying composition, but being a teacher of composition. And I'm really excited to dive into that process as well. So let's say hi to <span style="color:red" data-ts="143.92" data-end_ts="144.14" title="143.92" id=c_"143.92">__Ms__</span>. Sim <span style="color:red" data-ts="144.46" data-end_ts="144.66" title="144.46" id=c_"144.46">__again__</span>. Daria. Hi, how are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Daria Semegen: </b>Hi, Darwin 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thank you very much for taking some time to talk to us. I'm really excited to talk to you because, you have such a rich history and such a, such a depth of information. So I'm anxious to kind of pull some ideas out of your head, if I can. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Daria: </b>Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Why don't we, why don't we start off by having you tell us a little bit about, about what you're doing right now? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Daria: </b>Well, right now I'm talking to you <laugh>, as a reality. I thought we were going to talk about, what was going on before, or something historical. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, I think we'll do some of that, but I also wanna make sure that people, understand that you're Yeah. You're still a very active participant in the, music world. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Daria: </b>One of my recent works has to do with improv with live instruments and electronic files and hearing different performances, of that, which means, being willing to take, the risk of allowing improvisation. At one point in, in, dealing with the instrumental part, I decided, the instrumentalists today are, somewhat different than people. Several, a number of years ago, let's say 25 years ago, who were not interested that interested in improvisation or extended techniques or using daring to use their imagination and perhaps not always, conforming to what's going on in this score. So I wondered what would a performer play if they were listening to the two electronic, sections that comprised my piece bargi, for any kind of instruments, with electronic sounds in two section pieces. So, I found out I invited people to try this piece out, and my curiosity was, what if I wasn't bossing the, performers around by means of a score written everything completely written out, or, in such a way where I'm giving them a lot of hints about the, how to go about playing this thing. So I asked them to respond and collaborate with the sounds that already I had put together in these two sections of the Ello work. And, it's been played a number of times since, 2010. And for me, it's been quite revealing, in terms of the imagination that live performers apply to, in their version of responding to that sonic soundscape or that they are, trying to collaborate with. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That sounds really interesting. Now, you're, most well known as a composer, but you also have been teaching for quite some time, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Daria: </b>Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Can you tell a little bit, what about your path to becoming a composer? First of all, what did you learn first and how did you expand that knowledge over time? To what extent were teachers and instructors or collaborators important in the process? How did that work for you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Daria: </b>When I basically, started writing after maybe my third piano lesson at a, at a rather young age, and my main deal was I had, at the age of seven or so, I had no idea music was, written down in a score, oddly enough. So that became very fascinating from a graphic standpoint for me as <span style="color:red" data-ts="422.98" data-end_ts="423.1" title="422.98" id=c_"422.98">__a__</span> a child. And I started, I of course had to play the practice, the piano and learned the, pieces I was assigned, but also I was really bored with the types of exercise pieces. I had to play at that level. So I started writing my own pieces, to the annoyance of my piano teacher <laugh>. But that's really, that's really where it started. And I expanded into writing for ensembles and was <span style="color:red" data-ts="461.75" data-end_ts="462.1" title="461.75" id=c_"461.75">__lucky__</span> pianist to study music theory privately with a, a musician who was, the conductor of the regional orchestra and chorus. So this exposed me to, ensemble music and string <span style="color:red" data-ts="487.31" data-end_ts="487.66" title="487.31" id=c_"487.31">__ettes__</span> and so on before I, landed in a music conservatory as the undergrad. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Early on, were you sort of like fascinated by the inner or built-in logic of music theory? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Daria: </b>No. I, that's not really why I compose this. This is, I think it's interesting to know music theory, to teach music theory and to be able to apply it to analysis and also to, in appreciation of, electronic pieces as well. But I'm not composing in response to knowing music theory. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's really interesting, because it seems like there, there are a group of composers that are fascinated by the, I don't know, the, i I don't know how to express that other than just kind of say that, that interlogic or interlogic or almost like puzzle making that is music theory. And then there are other, other people I've talked to have talked more in terms of having sounds or songs inside their head that they wanted to release. What if, if it wasn't a response to music theory, what was the thing that drove you other than just boredom? What drove you into, wanting to write your own music, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Daria: </b>Liking sounds and going after certain sounds and being, excited by sounds rather than being excited by theoretical issues. So it's all well and good that people have their own individual way as artists to be inspired and to become interested in different aspects, of their experiences at academic and otherwise, and pursuing, ideas. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That makes, that actually makes a lot of sense. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Daria: </b>I, I do not require that students necessarily, people who are studying electronic music, are not necessarily, professional musicians. And some of them don't, read music, but they can hear and they listen, and they make interesting choices. Since the basic job of someone who is doing art is to choose. So these people have an intuitive ability, regardless of whether they know music inferior or not, <laugh>. And it's important to have these interests and intuition and self feedback. The more naturally that this happens, the more possible it is then to make interesting choices in putting together works. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's, that's really fascinating, approach and a way to, way to think about it. Now, in, in your own work, you actually, in your early compositions, you were working at the Columbia Princeton Electronic Music Center. One of your more famous pieces is called Electronic Composition number one, <span style="color:red" data-ts="699.79" data-end_ts="700.14" title="699.79" id=c_"699.79">__which__</span> that was done at at Columbia Princeton, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Daria: </b>Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Ok. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Daria: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="705.48" data-end_ts="705.9" title="705.48" id=c_"705.48">__Except__</span>, yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="706.73" data-end_ts="707.02" title="706.73" id=c_"706.73">__Okay__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Can you tell us the process of realizing a composition was like in, in those days? I mean, first of all, was that working with like analog systems and tape? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Daria: </b>Absolutely. Analog systems, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="728.25" data-end_ts="728.54" title="728.25" id=c_"728.25">__tape__</span>. There were no PCs available in 19 71, 72, and I actually started working in the medium myself, around 1965 by putting together a, recording of, sixth instrument instruments live players who recorded some, spatial notation music I had written. And we recorded this on Ampex, old Ampex portable machines. Sure. Which of course, knew at the time with microphones, and then spliced, the tape and kind of remixed the whole thing and made a sort of sonic collage. Then the performers played with that tape, so they played the same score, but the score had different flexibility so they could rearrange a little bit of the sequence of patterns that they were playing, et cetera. So we kind of made a collage piece, and I was inclined to doing, this <span style="color:red" data-ts="802.37" data-end_ts="802.66" title="802.37" id=c_"802.37">__type__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="802.68" data-end_ts="802.9" title="802.68" id=c_"802.68">__of__</span> experimentation and working, with recombining, sounds, at that time, or during, during those years, I had also heard a seminar with <span style="color:red" data-ts="820.78" data-end_ts="820.98" title="820.78" id=c_"820.78">__re__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="821.4" data-end_ts="821.62" title="821.4" id=c_"821.4">__er__</span> who was talking about it, opera, he had, put together, and I found his approach to scoring and thinking. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Daria: </b>Interesting. So it's basically acquiring thinking tools and different perspectives <span style="color:red" data-ts="837.96" data-end_ts="838.18" title="837.96" id=c_"837.96">__and__</span> how one can approach putting together material. Also <span style="color:red" data-ts="844.88" data-end_ts="845.1" title="844.88" id=c_"844.88">__the__</span> influence was the, very concise incisive thinking of, at scoring of Slosky, a non electronic music composer. So his, his approach was interesting. And also, of course, because of the sound result, the sonic result was, a very exciting outcome of this particular scores for which he wrote <span style="color:red" data-ts="879.86" data-end_ts="879.98" title="879.86" id=c_"879.86">__a__</span> notation as a tool to get to the particular <span style="color:red" data-ts="884.71" data-end_ts="885.06" title="884.71" id=c_"884.71">__found__</span> he wanted, he was aiming for. So, it, it was very interesting for me, me to, oh, I also, influenced, was a seminar by Earl Brown who brought some of his <span style="color:red" data-ts="900.82" data-end_ts="901.18" title="900.82" id=c_"900.82">__course__</span> and talked about his approach. So it's, thinking tools and ways, that I could assemble, try out, putting together my own, scores or electronic music <span style="color:red" data-ts="918.68" data-end_ts="919.1" title="918.68" id=c_"918.68">__sounds__</span>, ways of working would be much more interesting for me than conventional, music theory approach coming from that perspective. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, it, it makes sense because especially if you <span style="color:red" data-ts="936.86" data-end_ts="937.02" title="936.86" id=c_"936.86">__are__</span>, if, if sort of the thing that drew you into composition was, enjoying sound and experiencing sound, putting yourself in the position to be the creator of new sounds had to be really exciting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Daria: </b>I think the most exciting, thing about electronic music right away from me was the fact that the sound was accessible for me as a composer immediately, and I could react to it immediately and, try out different combinations of sound and mixes, right there on the spot without waiting for performances of by live performers as I would have to, with music for writing of the conventional sort. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So, so you were working with analog systems and tape. There was, at the same time, roughly, there were people doing sort of like the early, early computer music things. Did you, did you have a chance to ever play with those in their early days? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Daria: </b>Well, I actually had, some experience with way back when using key punch cards and entire stacks of them to make, to then have the sound converted from, the analog, I should say, from digital to analog and coming back to me on a gigantic, tape reel, on which I would hear things like bleep <laugh>, instead of an entire passage of music or several phrases that I had worked up. So I found <span style="color:red" data-ts="1057.4" data-end_ts="1057.64" title="1057.4" id=c_"1057.4">__that__</span> a very clumsy, non spontaneous way of working for me to send information, let's say, with a stack of key <span style="color:red" data-ts="1068.04" data-end_ts="1068.28" title="1068.04" id=c_"1068.04">__punch__</span> cards into a machine and getting, tape out of that, then having to have the tape converted, in a lab off, Columbia campus. Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1081.96" data-end_ts="1082.18" title="1081.96" id=c_"1081.96">__So__</span> it's a very clumsy way of working the, this was not like working with software and PCs that we have <span style="color:red" data-ts="1089.68" data-end_ts="1089.9" title="1089.68" id=c_"1089.68">__to__</span> assume, you know, we can work with our smartphones, we can, we have a lot of resources available. And in the 1970s and late sixties, you had filch. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, I was just wondering because, it sounds like you, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1107.42" data-end_ts="1107.54" title="1107.42" id=c_"1107.42">__a__</span>, one of the things that's really important to you when you're working with, electronic systems is kind of the immediacy of hearing the sound, changing the sound, or making alterations. And, at the time, computer music was anything but interactive. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Daria: </b>So that, that was not interesting to me. Also, it demanded too much specificity, and I like experimenting in various ways with sounds, kind of like painting on a canvas to, have this sort of freedom rather than being tied to a lot of specifics that I'm obligated to stick with constantly. So this kind of, method did not work with me with the early technology. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Absolutely. That makes sense. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Daria: </b>And again, the, the listening is extremely crucial, the availability of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1171.35" data-end_ts="1171.7" title="1171.35" id=c_"1171.35">__sound__</span>, very much the case as if I were a painter. I'd want to see, what I'm doing, the shapes, the colors, the textures, and then make choices on the spot. I wouldn't wanna delay somehow my ability to respond to what I'm doing. So the spontaneity of that very much, I guess as one, my deal with performance, if you're instrumentalist playing, you want, you <span style="color:red" data-ts="1202.82" data-end_ts="1202.98" title="1202.82" id=c_"1202.82">__wanna__</span> hear it right then, and you want to <span style="color:red" data-ts="1205.25" data-end_ts="1205.54" title="1205.25" id=c_"1205.25">__give__</span> yourself self feedback right then on the spot and be able to make the changes you need to shape the situation musically. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That makes, that makes a lot of sense. Now, one of the themes that this, this concept of choices is a theme that, that's coming up a lot in our discussion. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, when, how, how do you, yourself, how do you yourself make choices and how do you express the choice or a wise choice making process to your students? How, how do you, how do you do it and how do you help others do it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Daria: </b>Well, first I typically will model by showing them where I made certain decisions and why. So I try to, show them, illustrate some basic linking tools, and describing situations, regarding context. So what I'm doing is, typically associated with a particular context and how I would deal with, let's say a sound when it's in one context and then in another context. So everything I will explain then to them in detail, and they get some idea, on a, detailed level, nitty gritty of what goes on in my thinking and responding as a kind of model example of working. And they can go ahead, and then do whatever they want with that information, use that as a model or expand and see how they, go from there in developing their own ways of working and thinking. And then they share it with our center group. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Daria: </b>So it's very fascinating to see the ideas that, young composers especially will come up with, in terms of the things that they're looking to do and wanting to do and how, what they actually end up with. And one of the things that I, emphasize is that people be reality based in terms of, talking about sounds. And even though we are, often composers writing program notes, let's say, poetically about the music, that's simply a subjective response, of course, important in its own ways, but some of that may be <span style="color:red" data-ts="1388.36" data-end_ts="1388.58" title="1388.36" id=c_"1388.36">__on__</span> the part of creators or makers, somewhat of a wishful thinking situation. What I'm interested in, is it actually happening in the music, is what people say is happening actually there, and not simply a more, wish or illusion or self delusion. So, I think by keeping a, listening awareness, which is critical to working with sound, of course, and dealing, with that in <span style="color:red" data-ts="1430.9" data-end_ts="1431.02" title="1430.9" id=c_"1430.9">__a__</span> very aware way, this is a, truly, accessing the way you are working, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1440.36" data-end_ts="1440.58" title="1440.36" id=c_"1440.36">__be__</span> aware, I think that helps a lot. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1444.52" data-end_ts="1444.74" title="1444.52" id=c_"1444.52">__It__</span> gives clarity to what's actually happening in the music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's, that's really interesting. So do, so do you have specific exercises that you use to help people, tune fine, tune their ability to be, be, aware listeners? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Daria: </b>Yeah, definitely. One of the things that's important is evaluating the sound material that someone has already assembled. Usually, people are collecting, let's say a sound collection or sound library. They have, of their own sounds that they've put together or recorded, and they're then trying to figure out how to start a piece or where to continue, at which point you continue with adding other sounds. And so I do a kind <span style="color:red" data-ts="1505.44" data-end_ts="1505.56" title="1505.44" id=c_"1505.44">__a__</span>, sound appreciation evaluation where I listen to, say, snapshots of the material that they collect and just to understand one snapshot, and then have several meaning really short <span style="color:red" data-ts="1524.01" data-end_ts="1524.36" title="1524.01" id=c_"1524.01">__sound__</span>, fragments and being able to hear everything that is in there, that is expressing, articulating, and which parameters, meaning which, elements are working, whether we are observing a pitch or a noise situation, or the sounds are moving, along a registrar parameter. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Daria: </b>Or there is some other aspect going on such as, changing <span style="color:red" data-ts="1563.54" data-end_ts="1563.96" title="1563.54" id=c_"1563.54">__camera__</span> and texture, which is, a very interesting, thing to be aware of how you create textures, which for me are, I think of fabric, which is another way of expressing texture and how busy or not busy, the elements that you are seeing, are in patterns in that pattern and the consistency of pattern or less, rigorous consistency. So sometimes I will also, show students different, works of our <span style="color:red" data-ts="1608.88" data-end_ts="1609.3" title="1608.88" id=c_"1608.88">__online__</span> and talk about those in terms of, density, texture, contrast, different things that are in important to be aware of when you need them as thinking tools and understanding what's happening in your own music after you've done a few things, a few sounds for your piece and are trying to see what should happen next. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You know, what that reminds me of a little bit is that, kind of apocryphal, discussion about, a, I think it was a writing student who had trouble, putting together a, a written piece on her town. So the instructor said, well, why don't you do it on a specific building? And she still had trouble doing it, and then he instructed her to do it on one of the bricks in the wall on the building. And it was through that like intense, thoughtful interaction with detail that actually opened up a lot of the fountains of creativity. Then 
</p>

<p>
<b>Daria: </b>Very, very well put good, illustration, where attention to detail and increasing awareness and always being aware of sound and even aspects, like silence. Where are they put in, in a particular piece? How does it work? It really, it affects psychologically what's happening in the delivery of the music. And then our subjective response to that 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right now. I, I'm curious about something, since the sound and sound creation is really important to you. I can really understand. We're working with systems that you completely control, whether it's a, whether it's a synthesizer or I think you did, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1735.57" data-end_ts="1735.86" title="1735.57" id=c_"1735.57">__what__</span> I think it was Rhapsody was done with, the MIDI grand pianos. Is that correct? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Daria: </b>Yeah, I am how mini grand, but it's, it's unusual for me to work with a single system instrument because I prefer to, work with all kinds of sound modification done with a variety of machines. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, I see. And so is that, so is that where you, because I noticed a lot of your work is with either soloists or ensembles, and so is that, is that part of the, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1774.8" data-end_ts="1775.02" title="1774.8" id=c_"1774.8">__of__</span> the draw there that, that those end up being more complex systems than <span style="color:red" data-ts="1780.74" data-end_ts="1780.86" title="1780.74" id=c_"1780.74">__a__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1780.86" data-end_ts="1781.02" title="1780.86" id=c_"1780.86">__mission__</span> would be? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Daria: </b>Okay. This is, this is <span style="color:red" data-ts="1784.09" data-end_ts="1784.38" title="1784.09" id=c_"1784.09">__than__</span> a what a machine would be. No, I like the variety of expression in different machines, in different gadgets, let's say different softwares. Not necessarily, one machine thing as far as my writing. Hertu <span style="color:red" data-ts="1801.93" data-end_ts="1802.22" title="1801.93" id=c_"1801.93">__also__</span> like solo instrumental pieces. With those pieces, with a solo piece, I can delve into much more details. So it's about controlling details, and a lot of expression because that's the reason for controlling details to control these, expressions that are in the music. So, I find there's less, of a certain kind of compromising when doing solo pieces. That is also true, I'm talking about <span style="color:red" data-ts="1839.54" data-end_ts="1839.74" title="1839.54" id=c_"1839.54">__in__</span> instrumental music, but this is also true in electronic music where, I do not have to deal with performances as much as I enjoy different types of performances of music. I'm doing a piece that is more like a sculpture, a sound sculpture, and, I'm not, I'm spending time on it rather than, doing this in a real time setting, because in real time, for me, it would be as difficult as, let's say I'm, I'm, an artist inviting people to a art gallery exhibit, and I'm going to paint all the paintings and canvases in front of them. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Daria: </b>Right? That would not be possible for me to get into the, nitty gritty of the detail, and the, expression, get the expressions that I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1903.33" data-end_ts="1903.62" title="1903.33" id=c_"1903.33">__want__</span> with the sound materials that I chose to use. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's actually a really fascinating metaphor, because it works on so many levels. I mean, first of all, one of the things that happens when you would do like an exhibit <span style="color:red" data-ts="1917.8" data-end_ts="1918.02" title="1917.8" id=c_"1917.8">__in__</span> an art gallery is you get to do sort of like an additional level of editing, which is saying, of the things I've done, which are the things that, that maybe go together, which are the things that I would like to present in this environment. You get to, you get to have sort of like an extra level of editing that no real time performance can do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Daria: </b>Very good point. Also. So we're talking about this requires a certain amount of, of work and changing and changing your mind and adjusting and even even the lighting in the gallery is critical for how you see, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Daria: </b>For me, when I'm dealing with layers of sounds and individual sounds in a context with other sounds and layers, I'm very aware of volume levels that every time I have a registered change or <span style="color:red" data-ts="1975.32" data-end_ts="1975.74" title="1975.32" id=c_"1975.32">__temper__</span> change, I'm constantly adjusting the sounds, volume level. And when you do a tailored adjustment like that as a way of working, the sounds are heard, more in terms of their presence, in your soundscape, and the music becomes, a bit more robust, sounding more contoured. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Let's talk a little bit about your process today. What are the tools that you work with at this point? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Daria: </b>Well, I'm dealing with, I have my library of various sounds and to choose from, and I usually start with, listening to my material and choosing particular sounds to try out for a piece. So then I work on a, small section and see what happens with that. If I'm doing a composition, in the studio that has no performers, I'm then free to do no performers or let's say dancers where the situation is connected and dependent on others. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> input. Well, when I'm just doing a piece, let's say six <span style="color:red" data-ts="2071.54" data-end_ts="2071.82" title="2071.54" id=c_"2071.54">__media__</span> piece <span style="color:red" data-ts="2072.28" data-end_ts="2072.5" title="2072.28" id=c_"2072.28">__all__</span> by itself, then I can do whatever I want. And that means, I'm likely to experiment with sonic situations that are interesting for me to try out. So, I find that I have to be, interested in the sounds that I choose, as well as in the process that I devise in order to make that particular piece. And my pieces are not all resembling each other, in working method or the total outcome for each. So I tend not to, repeat the same system that I'm working with because I frankly not find it interesting to, repeat myself. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Daria: </b>My methods <span style="color:red" data-ts="2132.12" data-end_ts="2132.34" title="2132.12" id=c_"2132.12">__are__</span> thinking. So I find it's very natural to explore and experiment with electronic music, that is, has, a huge range of possibilities if you're interested in that kind of thing. And including, working with improvisation and extracting situations, sonic situations from that. So it's really limited only by your imagination and thinking tools and how you apply these things to working on a piece. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, I'm, I'm curious a little bit about the tools, because one of the things I'm getting from this conversation is that you really like kind of the elastic nature of sound and the ability to, to manipulate it at, you know, really greatly. And I'm curious to know what tools you're using to do that, because it seems like they would have to be very, sort of like agile tools to be able to keep, keep your interest, or, or do you, or do you actually, well, I'm sorry, go ahead. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Daria: </b>The only agile tool going is one's brain. And I can work, I enjoy working with all kinds of possibilities in terms of sound. At one point during the, there's actually a piece I collaborated with, my colleague <span style="color:red" data-ts="2237.18" data-end_ts="2237.86" title="2237.18" id=c_"2237.18">__<inaudible>__</span>, where we were, working on a score for an animation film, and we decided we were going to use a tri, which sounds just very pedestrian, but the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2251.87" data-end_ts="2252.22" title="2251.87" id=c_"2251.87">__trill__</span> we were getting from an <span style="color:red" data-ts="2253.3" data-end_ts="2253.58" title="2253.3" id=c_"2253.3">__auto__</span> automatic process from a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2256.98" data-end_ts="2257.18" title="2256.98" id=c_"2256.98">__KU__</span> machine or a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2259.21" data-end_ts="2259.5" title="2259.21" id=c_"2259.21">__mode__</span> was sounding extremely mechanical. So we actually went through the trouble of recording sine wave and splicing them into a simple pattern, creating loops and creating a piece called True study, which is a kind of coffee break piece, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Daria: </b>With layers and all kinds of, also stereo motion for these sounds. And of course, the texture being very interesting with tris at a higher speed, creating this kind of, atmosphere so that these things are also the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2302.42" data-end_ts="2302.98" title="2302.42" id=c_"2302.42">__decension__</span> on how you work. And in this case, this was <span style="color:red" data-ts="2306.46" data-end_ts="2306.7" title="2306.46" id=c_"2306.46">__then__</span> years ago, and you evaluate the quality of the sound, and as I said, the word mechanical popped up and that this stuff was too mechanical. It's too predictable pattern for us to be using. So we decided to modify, and this really is similar to, playing with live instruments because the variety in live performance is tremendous. That's why we have so many people pursuing it, and expressing live performance in their own way. So, this, these kinds of additions of nuances of, all kinds with any type of, hardware or software, analog or digital can be done. And depending on how aware someone is in listening to their material and also their musical needs, what they notice, how they think about it, these are the, thinking tools, the decision making tools based on, awareness. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. The, coming back to awareness and making choices as a compositional technique. Yeah, it's really, it's really interesting how, your way of thinking about the composition process and, and the actuality of composition is, kind of has this harmonious nature. That's, that's really cool. Now one of the things that, tends to be a output, you know, tends to be an output for composers is a score prior to starting the thing, we were talking a little bit, and you mentioned that you are not really married to the process of creation of a score. Is that correct? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Daria: </b>Not with electronic, use it. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Do you use any other devices to help coordinate things, or is it really an experimental and at the moment process? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Daria: </b>Well, when I'm working on a piece, I'm dealing with, choosing sounds that goes, basically listening and choosing and working with material that I've collected, purpose of, for the purpose of doing that piece. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Daria: </b>You know, I don't <span style="color:red" data-ts="2452.22" data-end_ts="2452.38" title="2452.22" id=c_"2452.22">__have__</span> any other tricks or icks or whatever, extra. I don't need, a score if I'm not depending on musicians, realizing a score, meaning playing a score. And I certainly don't need, in fact, in years ago when the copyright laws were such that they did not, accept, a sound recording for copyright, then studio composers would basically make a sort of abstract diagram or scribble on a sheet of paper and put their name on it, what the tag was, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2497.82" data-end_ts="2498.14" title="2497.82" id=c_"2497.82">__their__</span> electronic piece, and send that in because they, people still had this concept that a score would not be just a recording. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. A score was a prelude to a performance, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Daria: </b>And you have to have some something, written down. So that hasn't been the case for quite a while, but there's no reason for me to have a score if I have no use for it in terms of making a, sound sculpture, let's say, for which I don't have a live performer. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. When you do work with live performers, what, what do you create for a score? I asked this because I had a really interesting discussion with Pauline Oliver a few weeks ago, and she kinda described her, textual scores as a MEChA a mechanism for her to express, a feeling that couldn't really be notated, but could be expressed through words. And I thought that was, that's one really interesting way of doing, of doing scoring of a piece. What, when you're sharing your, your work or when you're gonna have performers do your work, what do you provide them from a standpoint of a score? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Daria: </b>Oh, I usually get more specific with the, an instrumental score in that type of, instrumental music composition, because I like to choose, how the sounds are made by these instruments and when they're made and how they, come together, in group. So, yeah. Again, it's all based on choosing an artist's job is to choose, right, your tools, your methods, and make your decisions, and what kind of, products you want to get creatively ultimately. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So now I get that, that you're able to sort of like, set the plate for performers. Now you mentioned, that some of your recent work has kind of brought improv, improvisation, into the, the game as well. How do you balance the desire to make choices and to sort of like design a soundscape, and still allow, still allow improv by the performers? I guess, this is something that I, as for my own composition, I struggle with because I really like the energy and stuff that improv brings, but it's sort of like, but I, but I really want to kind of control the mechanism too. How do you, how do you deal with that dual nature? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Daria: </b>Well, yours is a very interesting question and consideration. I think one, it really depends on your thinking. In dealing with situation, I have, wanted to compose the electronic, the two electronic, sections of the piece, which are, let's say, contrasting movements first. So I wanted to make, two established short electronic pieces that would be in, a set and they could be played in, in either one of them, could be the first piece or the second piece of the set. So any order. And I decided that instead of my bossing around the performer, we have very interesting performers these days who can tackle improvisation in an original way. And I should also say that a lot of the material, the way I got my sonic material, especially more complex areas of it had to do with improvisation as well. So there's improvisation that I did in terms of arising at different mixes of material, and then ultimately I had to choose from that how I was going to organize the sounds for each of the two sections of the piece. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Daria: </b>So I decided if I can do this, let them, contribute what they, what their, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2770.86" data-end_ts="2771.18" title="2770.86" id=c_"2770.86">__medical__</span> reactions may be to hearing the sounds that I put together. So it's basically a response situation. And in my instructions to performers, I write that they should be sonically responding, not imitating, but have a connection to the sounds that they are listening to from my piece, from the electronic side. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, and this could be any possibility if they wanna do something contrasting, they can go ahead and do that, or imitate in any way. It's any of these variation techniques that typically are done in any sort of music or for that matter aren't right. That people tackle and apply and see how it works. And since these are professionals who know their instruments very well, instead <span style="color:red" data-ts="2834.26" data-end_ts="2834.38" title="2834.26" id=c_"2834.26">__of__</span> my bossing them around about performance, I wondered what the hell they would play given the choice of hearing these sounds that are already there on a recording and see how they would respond. And so far, it's been very interesting for me because every time the piece is played, it's somewhat a different piece with perhaps different instruments and a different approach in delivery of instrumental. So it's, it's a piece that is in different versions depending on the performer that weighing <span style="color:red" data-ts="2879.48" data-end_ts="2879.7" title="2879.48" id=c_"2879.48">__it__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, thank you so much for being really open about your process and about kind of your methods. I think it's sometimes hard or it can be hard for people to talk about that stuff directly, it seems like, I don't know, it seems like I'm asking you to tell me how you wash your clothes or something. Right. It seems somewhat intimate, but, at the same time, I think it's the kind of thing that helps, that helps other artists understand what they're doing or what they could be doing to make their work better. Do you have any hints for budding artists, composers, of whatever sort? Do you have any, any suggestions for people? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Daria: </b>Well, usually my suggestions are based on the individual situations <span style="color:red" data-ts="2940.36" data-end_ts="2940.58" title="2940.36" id=c_"2940.36">__on__</span> how they're working and, what their ideas may be and what questions they would have. So I don't have any global nature, advice as much, in terms of creative work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I do think, though, that your ideas of, about, listening, awareness in listening and the choice making process, I think that actually gives everybody some good material to, to work with. I want to thank you so much for taking, taking the time out to do this interview. It was, as enjoyable and wonderful as I had hoped. So thank you so much for taking the time to do this.
