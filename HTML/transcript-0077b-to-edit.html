<b>Darwin: </b>And with little necessary introduction. Here's part two. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody Vasulka: </b>There's a really interesting thread here. So you kind of got this bug for working with gear and equipment. But you also have this thread of, of watching, <span style="color:red" data-ts="23.77" data-end_ts="24.06" title="23.77" id=c_"23.77">__your__</span> yourself playing music in your bebop band, but also ST's, work as a violinist kind of drew you in. There's this thread kind of of gear and this thread of like music. And then you get to New York and you see video in play and that captures your attention. But at some point, you start combining all of these into almost like a single thread. So you start making gear that manipulates video. You start working with synthesizers to develop sound, but working, you know, developing structures and developing more tools to make that work in a video space, to make video work in that space. And you start mixing and matching things. To me, that was a time where, where, you know, if you were going to get into electronics, someone had to bless you to be into electronics. Right? Right. And if you were going to be a, well even talk about your, your film studies, someone has to bless you to allow you to be a film editor or <span style="color:red" data-ts="93.34" data-end_ts="93.42" title="93.34" id=c_"93.34">__a__</span> film director, right? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, it seems to me like one of the harder things of the whole thing was just basically saying, I'm not gonna wait for anyone to bless me on any of this. I'm just going to do it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina Vasulka: </b>I tell you. I have a complete explanation for this. See, let's see. Just to take from when you take machines apart, eventually you make it into average experiments because you know how the things work. And you see the gears and how they translate from this motion to this motion. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And, you know, my father was sort of, looking at it and it didn't stop me, you know? And I polluted the whole place like this garbage. But it didn't kick me out of this place because he was kind of looking at me. 'cause he was hoping, and I would end somewhere <span style="color:red" data-ts="155.06" data-end_ts="155.26" title="155.06" id=c_"155.06">__as__</span> a machinist or something. But that was not, that was not me. I was somehow a little more ambitious. 'cause I was looking for the mystery. What is the mystery? What's the next, next step? So then also, let's say I went to this industrial school and after I was sent to a factory, which was very sophisticated factory, because I got grades, but still, I didn't know anything about mathematics. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>See, and I'm still don't know anything about mathematics. Numbers for me, was the only mystery I never could penetrate. Never. And so it, but they, I went, I was sent to this factory, which, <span style="color:red" data-ts="208.63" data-end_ts="208.92" title="208.63" id=c_"208.63">__what__</span> produced hydraulic machinery. But then when I understood that the hydraulics is something that you have to calculate, high mathematics, then I, after two days, they first gave me this paper and say, copy this. It was complicated, machinery, you know, hydraulic system. And I had it there for two years on that board, but I didn't touch it. Now imagine I'm in this communist factory producing also this kind of war material. And they were like hypnotized by me because all I did <span style="color:red" data-ts="265.62" data-end_ts="265.84" title="265.62" id=c_"265.62">__is__</span> sub in the corner and a room, my poems, poetry and prose. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>And then I had a friend there, or two friends, and we would go after the work to pick up mushrooms in the forest. It was just the next outside of the town. And I lived like that for two years. And they didn't kick me out. Even the boss knew that I haven't touched this work for two months in communist system. 'cause if they would know <span style="color:red" data-ts="304.39" data-end_ts="304.59" title="304.39" id=c_"304.39">__that__</span> outside of the factory, I go to jail and they would go to jail. Right? I'm still absolutely stunned what, who organized what kind of experience could defend it. And it's so abstract that I can't even tell you anything about it. Two cameras sitting in the further place, and there was about maybe 20 guys working. And they knew that I was not doing that. I was interested in culture or something, but they didn't do anything. And my boss felt he was playing tennis with my sister. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>You know? So he was kind of, I have no, i, I have no explanation to it. But then I realized I'm not made to do this, and probably I'm not gonna survive here. I'll be in jail soon. So I went to film school and apply <span style="color:red" data-ts="372.32" data-end_ts="372.44" title="372.32" id=c_"372.32">__I__</span> for the <span style="color:red" data-ts="374.21" data-end_ts="374.56" title="374.21" id=c_"374.21">__being__</span> accepted, which I was later when I asked my, you know, guy that, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="382.58" data-end_ts="382.8" title="382.58" id=c_"382.58">__was__</span> my teacher in film school, <span style="color:red" data-ts="384.69" data-end_ts="385.04" title="384.69" id=c_"384.69">__skill__</span> school, I said, how come that you get me in here? And I said, we didn't <span style="color:red" data-ts="392.6" data-end_ts="392.8" title="392.6" id=c_"392.6">__care__</span> for your photography. Some kind of movie. She made you <span style="color:red" data-ts="396.96" data-end_ts="397.2" title="396.96" id=c_"396.96">__like__</span> your poetry <laugh>. First time I realized I had some kind of a supervision by unknown, myth, mythological, mythological plane. I was part of something that navigated me step by step through my life now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>So I'm sorry for the interruption there. No, but you just said, you said that basically it was your poetry. That was what <span style="color:red" data-ts="428.34" data-end_ts="428.56" title="428.34" id=c_"428.34">__got__</span> you into film school. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>I <span style="color:red" data-ts="430.63" data-end_ts="430.92" title="430.63" id=c_"430.63">__just__</span> know that. But, but then what I'm saying now, now it's one point by one point so rational. Like from that, when I asked Sena take me out, and she said Yes, then, so that was my way out. So <span style="color:red" data-ts="449.68" data-end_ts="449.84" title="449.68" id=c_"449.68">__it__</span> was the moment of Iceland for half a year, whatever. Then it was going to, to to, you know, living with the, with the, with the uncle of her Penn, Romania. Then, it was going to New York to learn language. And then it was all automated by, by place. And I ended eventually through Buffalo to other places and sold. And it, it's so, it's so rational and beyond my choices, of course, at that time <span style="color:red" data-ts="495.98" data-end_ts="496.2" title="495.98" id=c_"495.98">__is__</span> a player in this whole thing. And so I cannot explain anyway, why I'm sitting here and talking to you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>I mean, at some point you had to decide to learn electronics. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>Oh 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>Yes. <span style="color:red" data-ts="510" data-end_ts="510.16" title="510" id=c_"510">__Sometime__</span> at some point. And, and not through traditional means. Traditional means of the time was like either doing an apprenticeship or going to university. And instead, you had to find your own way into that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>It's not my way, but the demon that navigated me all my life, <laugh> Okay. Actually gave me the power of being able to assemble. As long as I get a schematic, I could do anything. I see. But to struggle, I could do only basics. You see, I, I could make simple inventions of the electronics, like sort of, working signals, you know, that I could and make them, put them into different categories and try, how would they look like in this environment? How they, yeah, I was pretty good at that. But to go and step into like a digital world, these are numbers which I never got. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, I just cannot move this. I see. I couldn't really function in a digital world. I could apply and I could build digital system because, you know, I had <span style="color:red" data-ts="589.64" data-end_ts="589.8" title="589.64" id=c_"589.64">__these__</span> students that could do everything except build <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>Right? Right. And he designed <span style="color:red" data-ts="595.02" data-end_ts="595.24" title="595.02" id=c_"595.02">__his__</span> fabulous, kids there <span style="color:red" data-ts="597.54" data-end_ts="597.76" title="597.54" id=c_"597.54">__and__</span> Jeffrey Shire. And he was phenomenal, also good fiddler, you know, and, a little crazy and still arrived. And he gave me these designs on a paper and I, day and <span style="color:red" data-ts="614.88" data-end_ts="615.16" title="614.88" id=c_"614.88">__night__</span>, I, that was why <span style="color:red" data-ts="619.66" data-end_ts="619.88" title="619.66" id=c_"619.66">__at__</span> that time, that was the way he put things together. I make very little mistakes. He looked <span style="color:red" data-ts="625.68" data-end_ts="625.96" title="625.68" id=c_"625.68">__stiff__</span> and then find out, oh, it's one mistake. And I was a little embarrassed, sorry. And it was that if I could do the physical and if I had this <span style="color:red" data-ts="638.98" data-end_ts="639.4" title="638.98" id=c_"638.98">__garden__</span> students, we got <span style="color:red" data-ts="642.43" data-end_ts="642.72" title="642.43" id=c_"642.43">__stay__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="642.96" data-end_ts="643.16" title="642.96" id=c_"642.96">__advocate__</span> immediately to the whole different world. And, I don't know. <span style="color:red" data-ts="650.3" data-end_ts="650.52" title="650.3" id=c_"650.3">__But__</span>, but 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Yeah. But we went through this, I mean, first we learned the analog world. Yes. And basically piece of wave, wave forms and yeah. Signal, things like that. Yeah. And noise. The asset applies to video, not as it applies to audio. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="668.94" data-end_ts="669.16" title="668.94" id=c_"668.94">__We__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="669.16" data-end_ts="669.32" title="669.16" id=c_"669.16">__get__</span> vocabulary Completely correct. Yeah. Yeah. Invented some of that, you know. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>But yeah. But, and then we lived through the transition over to digital practically. I mean, learning <span style="color:red" data-ts="680.66" data-end_ts="680.88" title="680.66" id=c_"680.66">__boo__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="680.88" data-end_ts="681.08" title="680.88" id=c_"680.88">__and__</span> algebra, realizing that, yeah. Diagonal line was only achieved by steps, by points in, aligning themselves to become a line 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>That's called a non <span style="color:red" data-ts="693.52" data-end_ts="693.72" title="693.52" id=c_"693.52">__ledge__</span>. We, we 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Got that. Yeah. But we didn't, we didn't even that much get it out <span style="color:red" data-ts="697.48" data-end_ts="697.6" title="697.48" id=c_"697.48">__of__</span> books. Although we did get it out of books. No, but we got it mostly out <span style="color:red" data-ts="702.04" data-end_ts="702.2" title="702.04" id=c_"702.04">__to__</span> the student. <span style="color:red" data-ts="702.99" data-end_ts="703.28" title="702.99" id=c_"702.99">__Yeah__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>The touch 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Also and the daily struggle, because he also made mistakes. Right. And then he would <span style="color:red" data-ts="709.48" data-end_ts="709.68" title="709.48" id=c_"709.48">__have__</span> this thing because it was new to I, he <span style="color:red" data-ts="711.88" data-end_ts="712" title="711.88" id=c_"711.88">__would__</span> say, now here's a chip, and this chip can either do this <span style="color:red" data-ts="717.78" data-end_ts="718" title="717.78" id=c_"717.78">__out__</span>, which you would get this kind of images or that outta which you would get <span style="color:red" data-ts="722.92" data-end_ts="723.2" title="722.92" id=c_"722.92">__other__</span> kind of images. So which do you want? And <span style="color:red" data-ts="725.93" data-end_ts="726.28" title="725.93" id=c_"725.93">__Woody__</span> always said both. Yeah. <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>I was just like, you didn't even have to finish that sentence for me. No. 'cause I just saw that coming <span style="color:red" data-ts="734.96" data-end_ts="735.2" title="734.96" id=c_"734.96">__outta__</span> his <span style="color:red" data-ts="735.32" data-end_ts="735.52" title="735.32" id=c_"735.32">__mouth__</span>. Well, both <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Yeah. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="737.08" data-end_ts="737.28" title="737.08" id=c_"737.08">__then__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="737.28" data-end_ts="737.92" title="737.28" id=c_"737.28">__eventually__</span> he would say, because he, he had this idea that the left brain should speak to the right brain. So he was engaged in a lot of <span style="color:red" data-ts="746.34" data-end_ts="746.76" title="746.34" id=c_"746.34">__people__</span> that we didn't even have to understand over here. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And he would, then start saying, well, this chip can do this. And he <span style="color:red" data-ts="755.79" data-end_ts="756.08" title="755.79" id=c_"755.79">__chat__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="756.08" data-end_ts="756.28" title="756.08" id=c_"756.08">__with__</span> that, what <span style="color:red" data-ts="756.68" data-end_ts="757" title="756.68" id=c_"756.68">__would__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="757" data-end_ts="757.12" title="757" id=c_"757">__you__</span> want? Both, he would always answer it too, because he knew what <span style="color:red" data-ts="760.6" data-end_ts="760.8" title="760.6" id=c_"760.6">__he__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="760.93" data-end_ts="761.28" title="760.93" id=c_"760.93">__would__</span> do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>So this was our education <span style="color:red" data-ts="764.16" data-end_ts="764.28" title="764.16" id=c_"764.16">__actually__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="764.48" data-end_ts="764.68" title="764.48" id=c_"764.48">__It__</span> was our education. And, and there was no, <span style="color:red" data-ts="767.45" data-end_ts="767.74" title="767.45" id=c_"767.45">__none__</span> other, 'cause the others were maybe better educated, but they were rigid, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>Sure, sure. <span style="color:red" data-ts="774.82" data-end_ts="774.94" title="774.82" id=c_"774.82">__They__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>Didn't understand how to fly. And this guy was a fiddler. So he flew. He flew immediately. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>Flew all the time. Right. Well, and now the other people that were, that were working on video at the time at, at, you know, video exploration, what were they doing that was different? Were they more working with, I mean, were there other people that were kind of exploring on parallel paths or Yeah. Was everyone doing their own thing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>No, I was like, there was Eric <span style="color:red" data-ts="805.02" data-end_ts="805.26" title="805.02" id=c_"805.02">__Siegel__</span> who built the first <span style="color:red" data-ts="806.7" data-end_ts="806.98" title="806.7" id=c_"806.7">__three__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="806.98" data-end_ts="807.18" title="806.98" id=c_"806.98">__just__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="807.18" data-end_ts="807.54" title="807.18" id=c_"807.18">__inside__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>He was real breakthrough, you know? I know. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>He just, he had found a way to fix a TV set to be kind of abstract and absurd. And this gallery guy comes by and says, yes, but can you do it in color? And Eric, <span style="color:red" data-ts="826.28" data-end_ts="826.5" title="826.28" id=c_"826.28">__who__</span> was 17 years old, <span style="color:red" data-ts="827.5" data-end_ts="827.78" title="827.5" id=c_"827.5">__then__</span> instinctively said, of course. And then he had never done it or anything, but then he got <span style="color:red" data-ts="834" data-end_ts="834.22" title="834" id=c_"834">__the__</span> color TV with red queen and blue and out that came a colorizer, which <span style="color:red" data-ts="840.72" data-end_ts="840.94" title="840.72" id=c_"840.72">__mom__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="841" data-end_ts="841.22" title="841" id=c_"841">__Jim__</span> is very much now credited with, but <span style="color:red" data-ts="844.24" data-end_ts="844.46" title="844.24" id=c_"844.24">__not__</span> sure Eric make it. So, and Colorizer, if you think about it, is an incredible breakthrough. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>That's a game changer. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Totally. Of <span style="color:red" data-ts="855.86" data-end_ts="856.06" title="855.86" id=c_"855.86">__what__</span> they had even thought of. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>There were about maybe five of people we knew intimately also on the West Coast and everywhere. And we started to communicate and they did actually systems that we inherited from them mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And and then we could, we could operate them as, you know, but then of course, we <span style="color:red" data-ts="882.5" data-end_ts="882.7" title="882.5" id=c_"882.5">__need__</span> need more. Do 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>We need more? Now we had a community and we thought that was just a fraction of the whole community. But it wasn't, it that was it. <span style="color:red" data-ts="891.49" data-end_ts="891.84" title="891.49" id=c_"891.49">__There__</span> was 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b><laugh>. So you thought you were looking at a sliver and you were actually looking at the whole thing. <laugh>. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Because there were those two guys in <span style="color:red" data-ts="900.04" data-end_ts="900.6" title="900.04" id=c_"900.04">__<inaudible>__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>But we could use their machines and they were glad that they are stuck. We were using the 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>Machine, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>But we had no problem using it. Of course, 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>You know? No, but there was like, what's his name? Dan <span style="color:red" data-ts="912.79" data-end_ts="913.08" title="912.79" id=c_"912.79">__Dean__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>Yeah. I was gonna say the sand <span style="color:red" data-ts="914.76" data-end_ts="914.96" title="914.76" id=c_"914.76">__dean__</span> thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Yeah. 'cause he was a mathematician. He loved, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>He loved numbers <laugh>, he built <span style="color:red" data-ts="920.04" data-end_ts="920.24" title="920.04" id=c_"920.04">__this__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>He built this whole machine on numbers and on in versions, the positive to negativity. Right. He, he said, I will make a machine that can multiply, divide, add and destruct. That was the first thing he came up with. And that's the last thing we would ever have thought. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>Right? Sure. Of course. <span style="color:red" data-ts="943.87" data-end_ts="944.16" title="943.87" id=c_"943.87">__Yeah__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>And <span style="color:red" data-ts="945.44" data-end_ts="945.64" title="945.44" id=c_"945.44">__they__</span> were the best cost they had in San Francisco, experiments in television, national experiments 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>In television, 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Yeah. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And they were good. And they were colleagues, some to this day, like, Steve Beck and <span style="color:red" data-ts="962.12" data-end_ts="962.24" title="962.12" id=c_"962.12">__that__</span>, that was it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>It was still lucky community. See, we have not been many, but we really could communicate and change and operate. See, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>And when you communicated it was, you sent letters to each other? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>We visit usually. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>You would visit, there was 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="980.92" data-end_ts="981.04" title="980.92" id=c_"980.92">__A__</span> knock on the door. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>Yes. Knock on the door. <span style="color:red" data-ts="983.42" data-end_ts="983.64" title="983.42" id=c_"983.42">__It__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Usually meant also that we had to house those people. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>That's right. Right, right. To put them on the floor, you know? And, but in Buffalo, we had a actually good <span style="color:red" data-ts="993.16" data-end_ts="993.48" title="993.16" id=c_"993.16">__career__</span>. And, so we slept in a corner there, and we could let people stay for a while. And they work and they gave us all the secrets, and then they disappear. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>What made you go to Buffalo from New York City? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>Again, this is one of these mysterious things you see, because there was this strange man, and he still alive. He was a professor at that time in Buffalo, at the university. And he put together film group, you know, I don't know if you know his name in Gel Grady. Yeah. His name was, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1035.22" data-end_ts="1035.44" title="1035.22" id=c_"1035.22">__or__</span> Grady. But there was, like, Paul Schitz. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Oh, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1042.8" data-end_ts="1042.96" title="1042.8" id=c_"1042.8">__we__</span> had a very good, it was a very good faculty. And Buffalo was full of people who were interesting and important. The university was just astounding, but it was <span style="color:red" data-ts="1055.7" data-end_ts="1055.92" title="1055.7" id=c_"1055.7">__in__</span> this miserable place called Buffalo. So we didn't pay much attention to the city. But eventually, when the snow got to be as high as our shoulders, we decided we would have to leave 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>Give us the names of the guys <span style="color:red" data-ts="1071.26" data-end_ts="1071.48" title="1071.26" id=c_"1071.26">__who__</span>, faculty. It was 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Paul <span style="color:red" data-ts="1074.82" data-end_ts="1075.04" title="1074.82" id=c_"1074.82">__Cha__</span> Franklinton, Tony Conrad, James Blue. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>There's one more. No, 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>But then there were the other departments. They were like, creative Associates was <span style="color:red" data-ts="1087.13" data-end_ts="1087.33" title="1087.13" id=c_"1087.13">__the__</span> musical, entity. And everybody we met absolutely everybody 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>From 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>K to, for us. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>This was a very place 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Everybody was there. Yeah. Or came 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>Through. And we <span style="color:red" data-ts="1100.53" data-end_ts="1100.69" title="1100.53" id=c_"1100.53">__get__</span> educated also. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1102.09" data-end_ts="1102.21" title="1102.09" id=c_"1102.09">__I__</span> understood finally filmmakers because they were already half through, you know, they <span style="color:red" data-ts="1109.47" data-end_ts="1109.69" title="1109.47" id=c_"1109.47">__got__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1109.69" data-end_ts="1109.93" title="1109.69" id=c_"1109.69">__this__</span> frames, you know, that was all, they kind of, not all, but, you know, less narrative as a film, but a lot of, kind of interesting, no name for that. But they were moving away from a traditional narrative talk. Right, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1129.82" data-end_ts="1130.17" title="1129.82" id=c_"1129.82">__right__</span>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1130.17" data-end_ts="1130.25" title="1130.17" id=c_"1130.17">__Of__</span> people loving each other and kissing each other. Sure. The doll was gone. You know, there's no, no that, 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>But also to be in upstate New York meant that, we very shortly after we moved, we met, Ola was studying churches, and we met Gary Hill. And we thought they were very close colleagues. And Gary still is a close colleague. We were talking about it yesterday when we met him, that we still share something. But Bill slowly drifted into holiness. But he was a real experimenter when he was in <span style="color:red" data-ts="1168.69" data-end_ts="1168.89" title="1168.69" id=c_"1168.69">__the__</span> Syracuse. Really? Oh, yeah. And he is technically very end <span style="color:red" data-ts="1173.85" data-end_ts="1174.17" title="1173.85" id=c_"1173.85">__doubt__</span>. He understands systems and, I kind of miss him. But, he chose not to be our colleague. That's his choice. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1184.9" data-end_ts="1185.12" title="1184.9" id=c_"1184.9">__You__</span> didn't know that, huh? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>No, I didn't. I I never realized that you interacted and then broke with him in any way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Well, he would come and we would compare. We weren't really interacting as such, you know, but, he was discovering the same things at the same time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>So what was his problem with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1205.32" data-end_ts="1205.48" title="1205.32" id=c_"1205.32">__you__</span>? 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>We <span style="color:red" data-ts="1207.04" data-end_ts="1207.2" title="1207.04" id=c_"1207.04">__have__</span> never had personal problem with Bill. Never. It's fun to meet him every 10 years or so, <laugh>. But, he decided to become a kind of a holy man or middle class, guru, or I don't know what he is. Sure. You know, and that was very far from our interest. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>Right. Interesting. So how long were you actually in, how long were you in Buffalo? Well, first of all, the kitchen was the kitchen before you went to Buffalo. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Okay. So we didn't even really talk about that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>No. It was a typical Maka move, you know, <laugh>, that if they don't want to do it for you, you do it yourself. Sure. Because we would, ask our colleagues who had the showrooms, if we could, show <span style="color:red" data-ts="1259.32" data-end_ts="1259.6" title="1259.32" id=c_"1259.32">__there__</span>. And we couldn't because we were they other, we were somehow doing useless video. Right. And they were trying to save the world and <laugh>, fix their traffic light up on hundred and 25th Street. And we were just, out of there. And, so we, so we just have to do our own. And I was, and then they all came eventually <span style="color:red" data-ts="1285.55" data-end_ts="1285.84" title="1285.55" id=c_"1285.55">__when__</span> Oh, sure. Teaching was successful and asked to have a show at our place. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Yeah. That's how it goes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>It was very simple, but very without, a doubt. We just went to this man that it was an old building, you know, hotel tall, but no people, would live there anymore. Right. And, eventually took, it collapsed the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1313.32" data-end_ts="1313.52" title="1313.32" id=c_"1313.32">__end__</span>. We were not around that time anymore, but we got a whole <span style="color:red" data-ts="1318.48" data-end_ts="1318.6" title="1318.48" id=c_"1318.48">__a__</span> room. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1319.39" data-end_ts="1319.68" title="1319.39" id=c_"1319.39">__Nice__</span>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1320.03" data-end_ts="1320.32" title="1320.03" id=c_"1320.03">__Last__</span> room. And still in pro in progress. Other places in that floor. But the guy that ran it, what was his name? <inaudible>. Yeah. He was, what was he doing? He was, 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>He was kind of a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1336.64" data-end_ts="1336.96" title="1336.64" id=c_"1336.64">__built__</span> contractor and, very interested, in the arts. Yeah. Like a lot of New Yorkers are. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>Right. And also had this lady with him. And that was very much interested also in us. I don't know why. 'cause she actually pushed him into <span style="color:red" data-ts="1353.68" data-end_ts="1353.8" title="1353.68" id=c_"1353.68">__there__</span>. And anyway, so we got this room there, which we had to fix and, you know, clear and make a floor and everything. And we had a couple of friends that were specialty guy that did the floors. And then we opened it and it was for free, you know, not for audience, but all the people that wanted to show something were welcome. And then we did a very small amount of, you know, donations. And then it became, for two years, very active. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>See, we were, we were always counting our luck. All these people want to show here in the kitchen. And then only when we were through with the kitchen in two years and wanted to do something else, we realized that we were, it, we were the only place the other places of action had all closed down and moved away. And so unbeknownst to us, we, we felt so grateful. And Lamont Young would want to come and, do something there. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>And at the same time, Lamont Young was very grateful that you exist. 'cause that was the only place he could play. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>That's that the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1427.24" data-end_ts="1427.44" title="1427.24" id=c_"1427.24">__part__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1427.46" data-end_ts="1427.68" title="1427.46" id=c_"1427.46">__he__</span> didn't know. <laugh> and people came from Bell Labs Uhhuh, like, like that Max. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>No, 
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>

And then they all had <span style="color:red" data-ts="1446.62" data-end_ts="1446.84" title="1446.62" id=c_"1446.62">__our__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1447.05" data-end_ts="1447.4" title="1447.05" id=c_"1447.05">__build__</span> up evening in the kitchen. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>Listen, we did not expect anything like that, but it took over immediately. But when <span style="color:red" data-ts="1455.88" data-end_ts="1456.08" title="1455.88" id=c_"1455.88">__we__</span> left, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1456.83" data-end_ts="1457.12" title="1456.83" id=c_"1456.83">__they__</span> actually collapsed. Of course, it was a whole different other group of people that, we went to, you know, we <span style="color:red" data-ts="1466.56" data-end_ts="1466.76" title="1466.56" id=c_"1466.56">__were__</span> snatched to Buffalo. Right. And you say, okay, you guys, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1470.82" data-end_ts="1471.04" title="1470.82" id=c_"1470.82">__so__</span> yours. But now they're trying to struggle with, who actually, you know, what was the kitchen before or after. Yeah. And they have a problem, these people, because they, you know, we had the origins, you know? Right. And then they in inherited it, but they're trying to get rid of us, but they can't. You see, they, they <span style="color:red" data-ts="1494.58" data-end_ts="1494.8" title="1494.58" id=c_"1494.58">__try__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>They, they have ever since always tried to have a purposeful place. And that was the only thing we were uninterested in. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Any purposeful. So that was <span style="color:red" data-ts="1505.32" data-end_ts="1505.44" title="1505.32" id=c_"1505.32">__a__</span> kind of a split. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>But they're doing nice work and they are still, in a way, the only place for what is done and that kind of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1514.72" data-end_ts="1514.84" title="1514.72" id=c_"1514.72">__a__</span> performance. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>Okay. So thanks for that little detour. 'cause I wanted to make sure that I, that we got some of that history. So you're in Buffalo and you're actually meeting and working with these people as they either drop in or Dr. Or kind of drive through Buffalo. How long were you in Buffalo? 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Six years. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>Six years. Yeah. It took six years for the snow to get up to your shoulders. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Yeah. <laugh> because it was the fourth year when it got up to the Naval <laugh>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1547.98" data-end_ts="1548.2" title="1547.98" id=c_"1547.98">__But__</span> then <span style="color:red" data-ts="1548.42" data-end_ts="1548.64" title="1548.42" id=c_"1548.42">__the__</span> sixth year when it got up to the shoulder, and we, we would have liked to throw some mint into the, meter, the parking meter. But there was no meter. It was all under the snow. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>It was all under the snow. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Yeah. So, that was a good exit point. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>Right. So six years. What, where were you when you got there and where were you when you left in terms of like, the body of work and stuff like that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>It was actually our most prolific period. I see it now. From, we bought, rat <span style="color:red" data-ts="1589.27" data-end_ts="1589.56" title="1589.27" id=c_"1589.27">__etra__</span>, scan processor from 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1592.12" data-end_ts="1592.4" title="1592.12" id=c_"1592.12">__Analog__</span> to digital. Yeah. That was our glory. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>That's where we went through it all. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>Completely 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>Interesting. So you got a ru etra at that point. And that was when I was talking, you started, started playing with the scan work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Yeah. I was in 74 or Uhhuh 73, just after we moved to Buffalo. And we were on salary for the first time in a very long time. Oh <span style="color:red" data-ts="1617.16" data-end_ts="1617.32" title="1617.16" id=c_"1617.16">__wow__</span>. On a salary. We were salary people for six years. The only, only salary really we ever had in our lives. <laugh>. Yeah. So we could buy it, you know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>So for us to meet the film people was interesting and essential. And they also were very much influenced what we are doing. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1641.22" data-end_ts="1641.44" title="1641.22" id=c_"1641.22">__We__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1641.44" data-end_ts="1641.52" title="1641.44" id=c_"1641.44">__were__</span> coming by and snooping around and, but they still, filmmakers are filmmakers. They, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1649.11" data-end_ts="1649.4" title="1649.11" id=c_"1649.11">__they__</span> could, get them out of the filmmaking. Mm-hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b><affirmative>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1653.34" data-end_ts="1653.76" title="1653.34" id=c_"1653.34">__Chanel__</span>. I don't want to get too far. Just thinking about this though, in terms of technology too, because kind of a parallel track to all of the development and use of techno technology and tools was the development of artwork and particularly state of your work as a performer and, as a, as a video artist. And this is the time where on the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1679.32" data-end_ts="1679.52" title="1679.32" id=c_"1679.32">__art__</span>, you know, there was a technology, technology track here, but there was also art track where you were exploring with new forms of editing. You were exploring with new, new methods of performing and finding a way to build video as a performance instrument rather than just a linear track time track. Tell me some of how that went and and what were some of the roadblocks or decisions that you had to make to, to accomplish those things? 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Well, you know, when we were in, in kitchen, it was the audience performance, whatever place, sort of from the afternoon for, preparation to the, to the, event in the evening. But then it was hours after that we threw the people out and we had this <span style="color:red" data-ts="1734.65" data-end_ts="1735" title="1734.65" id=c_"1734.65">__court__</span> studio there in, in, Manhattan. And, that is when all this idea of multimedia came up because, we were all doing, we, we <span style="color:red" data-ts="1748.96" data-end_ts="1749.24" title="1748.96" id=c_"1748.96">__would__</span> do as many channels as, as <span style="color:red" data-ts="1751.2" data-end_ts="1751.36" title="1751.2" id=c_"1751.2">__there__</span> were monitors in the place. And, performances, electronic people would always have to bring their own stuff because we didn't have any. So they brought in synthesizer. We saw the a when it came out. And before that, there had been book <span style="color:red" data-ts="1767.27" data-end_ts="1767.56" title="1767.27" id=c_"1767.27">__land__</span>. There was already <span style="color:red" data-ts="1768.51" data-end_ts="1768.8" title="1768.51" id=c_"1768.51">__milk__</span> and so on and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1770" data-end_ts="1770.16" title="1770" id=c_"1770">__so__</span> forth. So it was very educational for us and for me to see that I wouldn't have to, do a single channel. But then it was strange enough, Gary Hill sort of pulled me also into something because he did this fabulous six channel audio installation. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1789.58" data-end_ts="1789.8" title="1789.58" id=c_"1789.58">__No__</span>, I mean, video installation as a corridor. And, I said, you know, he just challenged me, if, if that punk can do it, then I can't do it. <laugh>. And I started just, pouring them out, you know, Uhhuh 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b><affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Yeah. And for me, it was the way out of, of editing and single channel. And that thing I to tell <span style="color:red" data-ts="1812.6" data-end_ts="1812.92" title="1812.6" id=c_"1812.6">__Carrie__</span> this, I don't think I ever told him, not even yesterday when <span style="color:red" data-ts="1817" data-end_ts="1817.12" title="1817" id=c_"1817">__he__</span> was sitting <span style="color:red" data-ts="1817.39" data-end_ts="1817.68" title="1817.39" id=c_"1817.39">__next__</span>

<p>

It's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1818.5" data-end_ts="1818.72" title="1818.5" id=c_"1818.5">__in__</span> interesting. That period is now in my shadow. I can't get there. From the beginning. Yes. But when we started to do the digital part, you see, suddenly I like, I have a lot of documentation on that, on building. 'cause I wired all the boards because, our student was giving me the papers. Right. And overnight, you know, he was <span style="color:red" data-ts="1848.6" data-end_ts="1848.84" title="1848.6" id=c_"1848.6">__always__</span> working overnight and I was working <span style="color:red" data-ts="1850.9" data-end_ts="1851.12" title="1850.9" id=c_"1850.9">__all__</span> day. And, so I could do that. But then I just don't remember once we start programming it, how'd that happen? But you must have a better memory. Did you create some software? 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Yeah, we had this character called, Walter Wright. Ah, okay. It was a phenomenal programmer. Yeah. And, but, kind of into uselessness. He was only interested in doing all the parameters, running all the registers so that every color could go from the darkest to the brightest. Every movement would go from beginning to end. Mm-hmm. Like endless ramps and, and everything. But that was our school. Right. And then we also, had some students, because we put a, we put a computer, I think 75 or <span style="color:red" data-ts="1911" data-end_ts="1912.48" title="1911" id=c_"1911">__7 6 6__</span>. One of the very first micro or <span style="color:red" data-ts="1916" data-end_ts="1916.28" title="1916" id=c_"1916">__many__</span> computers for personal use. It was deck. Do you remember Deck? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>Yeah. Actually, my first computer systems I worked on, yeah. Were deck computers. The 11, 7, 80 and 11. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Yeah. 11. And the problem <span style="color:red" data-ts="1930.08" data-end_ts="1930.32" title="1930.08" id=c_"1930.08">__with__</span> that was, it was a Octa system. Right. So we, we struggled with Octa system and you learn enormous amount to just try to make anything move. We didn't know that once you <span style="color:red" data-ts="1944.4" data-end_ts="1944.56" title="1944.4" id=c_"1944.4">__have__</span> computer, you have to make them move. It's not like 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>He doesn't do it for you. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>No, not like analog. Right. So we got the characters like <inaudible>. I see 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>Big black one. I, that's in my shadow. Get that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Yeah. And, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>That's fic you know, because we also recorded it. We a lot of material that we have never shown because it's a, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1968.03" data-end_ts="1968.32" title="1968.03" id=c_"1968.03">__this__</span> learning, you know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>It's material test, test material. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>On <span style="color:red" data-ts="1971.96" data-end_ts="1972.12" title="1971.96" id=c_"1971.96">__it__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1972.18" data-end_ts="1972.4" title="1972.18" id=c_"1972.18">__in__</span> the videos and, various records. So one day when we really get our shit together, that would be a good thing for history. 'cause that period was unique and No, no, actually many other people started to do a complicated, digital, machinery. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>Now, once you left Buffalo, where did you go? 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Santa 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>Fe. That's when you, that's when you made the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2002.84" data-end_ts="2002.92" title="2002.84" id=c_"2002.84">__most__</span> Santa Fe. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>And most attractive thing to us was 300 days of Sunshine a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2007.76" data-end_ts="2007.92" title="2007.76" id=c_"2007.76">__year__</span>.

<p>
<b>Woody: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2008.26" data-end_ts="2008.48" title="2008.26" id=c_"2008.26">__Oh__</span>, I hear that. Yeah. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2009.8" data-end_ts="2009.92" title="2009.8" id=c_"2009.8">__It__</span> wasn't any kind of intellectual community or, or anything else. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>Was there anyone there at all? No. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b><laugh>, there wasn't. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>I don't think that, 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>No. But then people started coming partially for us. Like say Jean Young <span style="color:red" data-ts="2028.4" data-end_ts="2028.72" title="2028.4" id=c_"2028.4">__Blood__</span> and 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>And then the school. But, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>Right. S f a I you mean, or 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>The Santa Fe College. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>Santa <span style="color:red" data-ts="2037.88" data-end_ts="2038.04" title="2037.88" id=c_"2037.88">__Fe__</span> College. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Okay. That hired David Stout. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>Right, right. And 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Then things started really moving. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>There was no machine made by anybody there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>No. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>So when you first moved there, it was literally just to, well, I imagine especially I made a similar move. I went from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, which is almost always gray to Colorado, which is almost always sun. So I totally understand what you're, why you did it. But, it was just literally to escape. Yeah. The environment. And why Santa Fe of, did you just like pick a map or did someone just whisper in in your ear? Or? 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>We had driven through there. But you see Santa Fe sounds a little bit like <span style="color:red" data-ts="2082.59" data-end_ts="2082.88" title="2082.59" id=c_"2082.59">__Shri__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2082.9" data-end_ts="2083.12" title="2082.9" id=c_"2082.9">__Law__</span>. Ah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b><laugh>. You're right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>We <span style="color:red" data-ts="2087.58" data-end_ts="2087.8" title="2087.58" id=c_"2087.58">__can__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2088.21" data-end_ts="2088.56" title="2088.21" id=c_"2088.21">__leave__</span>, actually. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>So it wasn't, it wasn't a particularly rational decision, Santa Fe versus something else. No, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>We didn't, it wasn't, it wasn't a target for sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>But what's interesting is you guys seem to have, I mean, y'all are in love with Santa Fe, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2106.42" data-end_ts="2106.64" title="2106.42" id=c_"2106.42">__And__</span> these <span style="color:red" data-ts="2106.86" data-end_ts="2107.08" title="2106.86" id=c_"2106.86">__are__</span> these mysterious things that you cannot explain. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>Right. Again, it's your demon driving, the, driving the, the bus for you. Here. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>We, we stayed there. We actually rotated a little bit, around, and then we realized <span style="color:red" data-ts="2122.15" data-end_ts="2122.44" title="2122.15" id=c_"2122.15">__that__</span> is kind of a magic place. And there was these, remember when we were watching these, things that, that were on the top, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2131.64" data-end_ts="2131.92" title="2131.64" id=c_"2131.64">__<inaudible>__</span>. And I said, shit, this is unusual. And, so we were magnetized. We were just running around for three days. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>And Yeah. But I remember Woody driving up and down there, these little, what are they called? Spa getto in Spanish. The, the little, enclaves of Spanish Learning. And he says, I think I like it here. This is Catholic. And that is already, to me, a great shock to <span style="color:red" data-ts="2163" data-end_ts="2163.08" title="2163" id=c_"2163">__say__</span>, what did they say? <laugh>? Yeah. You said it's Catholic sin around every corner. <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>Thank you. No, it, it, it was, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2176.94" data-end_ts="2177.16" title="2176.94" id=c_"2176.94">__bad__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>It's like nudity and river somehow. But I don't know how to explain it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>It's Santa Fe is one of those places that it, it's, it has a siren song for a certain, certain kinds of people. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, so you moved there and just, just to get away, did you, like, have, so by this time you've probably gathered up quite a pile of electronics and gear and computers and all this stuff. How big of a task was it even moving there? 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Not much. No. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>But remember there was Los Alamos National Laboratory. Ah, true. And that was my magnet after 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>Sure. Of course. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>After I discovered the city, the town, then I, you know, it was only what, an hour Right. To drive there and you could find the highest quality pieces of complete assemblies. And they took them home and I could again, take them apart. Sure. So I was like a, it was a dejavu. Right. And then after they close down, there still is a place in, in, what's the town beyond the big town? Beyond, beyond <span style="color:red" data-ts="2258.92" data-end_ts="2259.04" title="2258.92" id=c_"2258.92">__a__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2259.04" data-end_ts="2259.28" title="2259.04" id=c_"2259.04">__down__</span> there. South Albuquerque, Albuquerque, Albuquerque. There's still is one of two places that you can see that ancient, you know. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>But War Legacy. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>But Creed came into it because when it was there in Los Amos, they were so desperate to get rid of it. And what we getting rid of, or say <span style="color:red" data-ts="2279.38" data-end_ts="2279.8" title="2279.38" id=c_"2279.38">__Tempes__</span> corrector, which was a magic <span style="color:red" data-ts="2281.35" data-end_ts="2281.64" title="2281.35" id=c_"2281.35">__word__</span> to everybody in <span style="color:red" data-ts="2282.49" data-end_ts="2282.84" title="2282.49" id=c_"2282.49">__India__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2283.22" data-end_ts="2283.44" title="2283.22" id=c_"2283.22">__On__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2283.44" data-end_ts="2283.56" title="2283.44" id=c_"2283.44">__The__</span>, and, and that we had to pay minimum 2000 up to $5,000 for, and it would be laying out there in the yard for 20 bucks. And you only had to plug it in. It was fully 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2296.72" data-end_ts="2297.12" title="2296.72" id=c_"2296.72">__<laugh>__</span>. Yeah. It's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b><crosstalk>. They just <span style="color:red" data-ts="2298.6" data-end_ts="2298.76" title="2298.6" id=c_"2298.6">__wanna__</span> get rid of it because they were done. And 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>That was the idea that after every project was finished, they had to get rid of everything. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>That was <span style="color:red" data-ts="2306.48" data-end_ts="2306.6" title="2306.48" id=c_"2306.48">__a__</span> rumor. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>Well, it's, it's actually interesting because I know just from my own experiments with electronic circuitry, there's a tremendous number of people that deal with surplus electronics. Yeah. All based out of New Mexico. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Really? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>And I wonder if it isn't because of this culture that churn through electronics and then had to make it go away. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>Oh, yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>I think it might have been part of why they got Grant. They got a grant to buy something or solve some problem. And, the idea was that it would fall to the taxpayers after the original idea when people were still <span style="color:red" data-ts="2346.94" data-end_ts="2347.36" title="2346.94" id=c_"2346.94">__behind__</span> and moral. Right. And then they upstairs realized what they had. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>And 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>Just, you see, when I, now look at the, kind of assembly of what we've got, it's, it's almost a thousand pieces. See we had one time and we tried to auction it one day after that, probably about three years after we put <span style="color:red" data-ts="2375.86" data-end_ts="2376.08" title="2375.86" id=c_"2375.86">__an__</span> auction. But nobody would even touch it. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>So, I, I'm still trying to wrap my head around the move to San Santa Fe because you went from New York where there was a lot of performance and a lot of activity. You go to Buffalo, which has a lot of activity, and you have kind of this itinerant group of people coming through. You moved to Santa Fe. Did people start visiting you just 'cause you were there? 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>No, this visiting us started from day one. Uhhuh. <affirmative>. Yeah. We have a fond memory of all these people. We call them the cosmic messengers. And they would knock on our door and say, my name is Windham, and I do video come in. You know? Right, right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2421.14" data-end_ts="2421.36" title="2421.14" id=c_"2421.14">__And__</span> so that has always been traffic around us. Actually now there is no traffic anymore. People are so polite, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>Different generation, you know. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Well, they sometimes call, they wouldn't dare to just come and knock on the door. They call and very ly ask <laugh> if they <span style="color:red" data-ts="2440.04" data-end_ts="2440.24" title="2440.04" id=c_"2440.04">__could__</span> talk to us. It's different. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2442.9" data-end_ts="2443.12" title="2442.9" id=c_"2442.9">__It__</span> is different. Yeah. And so, eventually then between the school, gene Youngblood coming down there, which, that must have been, he must have been a hoot to be around. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>He was good to be around. Yeah. He was very good. And, as David Stout said yesterday, he, it is undoubtedly, gene <span style="color:red" data-ts="2465.12" data-end_ts="2465.4" title="2465.12" id=c_"2465.12">__<inaudible>__</span> who caught him in there and everything.

</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>Who are some of the other people that ended up in Santa Fe that are <span style="color:red" data-ts="2474.1" data-end_ts="2474.32" title="2474.1" id=c_"2474.1">__in__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Well, there are several like converts that, we came across pre-video and now <span style="color:red" data-ts="2483.8" data-end_ts="2484" title="2483.8" id=c_"2483.8">__do__</span> video and, who have been artists in the past, but not particularly in this field.

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>Okay, so like advisement advising you on like a hundred percent your work, 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>You mean? No, no, no, no. How to clean up our computer and Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>I see. Oh, right, right, right. Okay. So he's like your consultant and 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>He's a consultant. Yeah. Got it. And unfortunately, he became rich. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2528.6" data-end_ts="2528.8" title="2528.6" id=c_"2528.6">__She__</span> inherited money, his wife. And so they don't need us anymore. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b><laugh>, he didn't need us. Right.

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>It's terrible.

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>Needs to be made available so that people can understand. I feel like we're not doing a really good job of showing people what's been done so that they can build on top of it. Yeah.

</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Yeah. Right. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Well, we have a large collection, of work that we liked and then we stopped collecting around the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2629.52" data-end_ts="2629.76" title="2629.52" id=c_"2629.52">__tunnel__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2629.76" data-end_ts="2630.24" title="2629.76" id=c_"2629.76">__section__</span>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2630.38" data-end_ts="2630.6" title="2630.38" id=c_"2630.38">__We__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2630.6" data-end_ts="2630.8" title="2630.6" id=c_"2630.6">__later__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>That's when we stopped collecting. It was, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>And now lately we have <span style="color:red" data-ts="2636.6" data-end_ts="2637.04" title="2636.6" id=c_"2636.6">__venture__</span> into Dome. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2640.34" data-end_ts="2640.56" title="2640.34" id=c_"2640.34">__See__</span> there's a dome in near Santa Fe, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>Right? Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>And, it's a little obsolete. And then, also would like to update it <span style="color:red" data-ts="2651.1" data-end_ts="2651.32" title="2651.1" id=c_"2651.1">__in__</span> all <span style="color:red" data-ts="2651.61" data-end_ts="2651.96" title="2651.61" id=c_"2651.61">__three__</span>, sort of redo it because we are not into looking up, you know, <laugh> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2659.56" data-end_ts="2659.76" title="2659.56" id=c_"2659.56">__bad__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2660.34" data-end_ts="2660.56" title="2660.34" id=c_"2660.34">__bad__</span>. Right. I hear <span style="color:red" data-ts="2661.96" data-end_ts="2662.04" title="2661.96" id=c_"2661.96">__you__</span> brain here. And so now we are <span style="color:red" data-ts="2665.08" data-end_ts="2665.28" title="2665.08" id=c_"2665.08">__going__</span> to look down rather, you know, <laugh>. So, but they are okay because they understand us and also themselves 'cause we are trying to recover or re re set them into ti horizontality or actually looking down a little bit, you know? Right. Yeah. And 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Maybe kind of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2686.52" data-end_ts="2686.6" title="2686.52" id=c_"2686.52">__a__</span> swimming pool and the audience would be on balconies 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>Carrying down. Yeah. That's, that's an interesting in, in all the people that are doing different kinds of video, it seems like the people that are doing domes kind of have a little bit of a flavor of what you talked about in the early days, that most of the domes are part of museums or part of something else, and they don't want you to come in and mess around with the equipment. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2715.58" data-end_ts="2715.8" title="2715.58" id=c_"2715.58">__Ah__</span>, and it's, it's like a lot of old and hardware based equipment, although most of 'em are changing over to digital systems. But what you have is you have these groups of people that wait until they leave for the night and then sneak in there and start experimenting with the don't. And again, it's almost a, it's almost a deja vu of the early days of video people doing stuff that nobody wants, touching stuff that nobody wants 'em to touch, you know? Yeah. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>But that's why we are, we can do it because it's obsolete and, but the guy that <span style="color:red" data-ts="2750.27" data-end_ts="2750.56" title="2750.27" id=c_"2750.27">__runs__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2750.78" data-end_ts="2751" title="2750.78" id=c_"2750.78">__it__</span> knows what he's doing. He can put it together. There's a lot of software that mm-hmm. <affirmative> we have never seen before. And so they can make, and we look at the work that we have done, which <span style="color:red" data-ts="2762.88" data-end_ts="2763.04" title="2762.88" id=c_"2762.88">__we__</span> can hardly recognize it because it's so all concentrated and stitched nicely. So if there would be updates of quality of projection and lenses and all that stuff, and light that, that would be probably worth it. Right. We are now using it as experiment. And then when there is another possibility, we could probably go and emerge in a kind of a, you know, large sort of format. But we just started about one, one month ago, <laugh>. So, but we are welcome and we can do it. We can go there now. We invite invited every week now for Oh, that's great. Next a month or two. So we'll be finding the knowledge, how things are and try to actually produce for it. And, especially <span style="color:red" data-ts="2826.68" data-end_ts="2826.96" title="2826.68" id=c_"2826.68">__these__</span> abstract work become magical more than they are because I don't know if the extraterrestrial narrative exists, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2836.19" data-end_ts="2836.48" title="2836.19" id=c_"2836.19">__then__</span> we will just try to experiment further. And, but yes, it's actually fitting. Okay.

</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>Expand. There's, there's, there are some spatial things that happen in a dome absolute. That are pretty, pretty magical. That's, that's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>Magical. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Like, no straight liner straight. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>I know. That's 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Just 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b><laugh> crazy. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>Fantastic. Yeah. So, so we are finally getting taste of it and access for any problem. We just go there and he puts it up and he's smart enough to operate it. That's, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>That's cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2884.05" data-end_ts="2884.4" title="2884.05" id=c_"2884.05">__We'll__</span> see if <span style="color:red" data-ts="2884.64" data-end_ts="2884.8" title="2884.64" id=c_"2884.64">__he__</span> can leave the legacy there.

</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>Can't redo the old.

Like, it's just the basics. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>So at this, so here we are in Seattle, you're doing, you are part of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2917.3" data-end_ts="2917.52" title="2917.3" id=c_"2917.3">__the__</span> four by three exhibition. They bring you in, you get to do some panels, talk to people, and that's one portion of what you do. You basically bring your work into a place and exhibit it and kind of interact with the public in a way that hopefully can clue them in a little bit on what your work was about. What are some of the other things that you're doing though now? Because I know you're at like, you're like active with the archives in some way. Yeah. The last time we met was actually a discussion about the archives. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>I mean, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2952.98" data-end_ts="2953.2" title="2952.98" id=c_"2952.98">__in__</span>, in my case, I'm still cleaning after myself and, but I'm tempted now to, and something else, you know? 'cause now it's possible. Stan goes <inaudible>, she goes up and up and up. But, I don't know if, you <span style="color:red" data-ts="2973.88" data-end_ts="2974.4" title="2973.88" id=c_"2973.88">__condition__</span>, if you see that way, what, is your, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>Because you're still doing perform, you're still an active performer, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Not really. Really? No. It's just, there is no demand for it. There's nobody asking for it. I would like to stop by Colorado and get a little more done with, and Tim always says, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2999.08" data-end_ts="2999.28" title="2999.08" id=c_"2999.08">__yep__</span>, by all means. And that's the end of that and so on. But now I'm not really that active. First of all, that box that, you know, is kind of unfriendly. It's not a friendly box. <laugh>. And I would <span style="color:red" data-ts="3012.83" data-end_ts="3013.12" title="3012.83" id=c_"3012.83">__need__</span> to have some more. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>You talking, you're talking about the connection to your violin. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Yeah. Yeah. I need also some crazy harmonize or something that is unpredictable and doesn't do what you think you're doing because it is nice to be on the stage, and especially in my case, because, any tone or any strike will do something right. And it'll surprise me more than the audience just thinks that I am in charge. But I get surprised. Do you have lunches of go just one direction? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>Do I have what? 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Plungers, I mean, I liked always to use Clenchers and the, the one that was called <span style="color:red" data-ts="3054.22" data-end_ts="3054.64" title="3054.22" id=c_"3054.22">__bubble__</span> pole. Yes.

<p>

</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Pole. Yeah. And then I didn't understand that. Whenever I tried plunger after that, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3060.84" data-end_ts="3061.04" title="3060.84" id=c_"3060.84">__it__</span> always went, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3061.86" data-end_ts="3062.08" title="3061.86" id=c_"3061.86">__you__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>Always <span style="color:red" data-ts="3062.28" data-end_ts="3062.48" title="3062.28" id=c_"3062.28">__go__</span> down and up, down up. Right. It's amazing sound. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Yeah. I'm intrigued. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3066.87" data-end_ts="3067.16" title="3066.87" id=c_"3066.87">__Yeah__</span>. Only my learning curve has slowed down to almost flat. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>Well, but it's not a 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Curve anymore. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b><laugh>, thank you so much for taking the time. I really appreciate it. Yeah. And as always, I learn a bunch of new stuff about the people I talked to and, so it was a real pleasure for me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Do you have a listen to Teddy Gross? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>Yeah. Well, I, I used to be obsessed with her really? On, on N P R. Well, first of all, the same last name. How could I not? Right. Oh, yeah. And, but I always thought that she was a exceptionally good interviewer. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Yeah. She was in the first and almost only class I ever taught. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>Oh, really? 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>And she wasn't Buffalo. I tell you, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3112.72" data-end_ts="3112.92" title="3112.72" id=c_"3112.72">__there__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3112.92" data-end_ts="3113" title="3112.92" id=c_"3112.92">__were__</span> interesting people who came through Buffalo. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>Well, it's funny because I actually, you know, in my like, digital software world, it's a lot of people that went through <span style="color:red" data-ts="3122.4" data-end_ts="3122.52" title="3122.4" id=c_"3122.4">__B__</span> Buffalo and that too. Yeah. Really. It's a, it's a place that, you know, maybe it's because they are so remote. Yeah. They push hard to get the best, you know, really interesting people. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>No, it's, it's magic because, the guy who helped us to set this whole execution in Germany, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3141.92" data-end_ts="3142.24" title="3141.92" id=c_"3141.92">__<crosstalk>__</span> mm-hmm. <affirmative>, he was just a noisy kid, a local guy in the neighborhood, and he stands in front of the synthesizer with <span style="color:red" data-ts="3151" data-end_ts="3151.16" title="3151" id=c_"3151">__your__</span> synthesizer. And it's fascinating. And Tony Conrad stops by and said, are you fascinated by this? And the kid says Yes. And he went all the way to become like a full <span style="color:red" data-ts="3164.15" data-end_ts="3164.64" title="3164.15" id=c_"3164.15">__fledged__</span> Let's bubble <span style="color:red" data-ts="3165.83" data-end_ts="3166.12" title="3165.83" id=c_"3165.83">__came__</span>. Oh yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>And, and then a lot of them, like the guy worked with us, it was because it was the cheapest school in the system. Right. And to me is, almost <span style="color:red" data-ts="3176.66" data-end_ts="3176.88" title="3176.66" id=c_"3176.66">__for__</span> three or worse than 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>Right. But 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>After, almost <span style="color:red" data-ts="3179.74" data-end_ts="3179.96" title="3179.74" id=c_"3179.74">__for__</span> free, the buffalo was almost three or more than any other. So we got kind of a lot of so-called <span style="color:red" data-ts="3186.92" data-end_ts="3187.32" title="3186.92" id=c_"3186.92">__bridge__</span> that it turned out is to be something else. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>Well, you know what's interesting is the school that, David is in now, university of North Texas. Yeah. That's where I went to school. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>What school? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>The University of North Texas. The, the one in Denton. That's the one that David teaches at. Yeah. That when I went there, that was North Texas State University. Oh. But back then it was the, for I could work a week and pay for my school for a semester. Right. So that's how I did it. I would work for a week. Yeah. Get enough money, pay for the semester, and then kind of Scrabble from there. But, it was, it was there, there again, it was that thing where it was the cheapest university in the <span style="color:red" data-ts="3236.72" data-end_ts="3236.92" title="3236.72" id=c_"3236.72">__system__</span>, so it kind of got the dregs of students. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Except those were the bizarrely interesting students. And it was a fantastic place. So I'm gonna shut this down <span style="color:red" data-ts="3248.1" data-end_ts="3248.32" title="3248.1" id=c_"3248.1">__off__</span>. Thanks again so much.
