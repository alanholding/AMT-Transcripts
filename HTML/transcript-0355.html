      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Okay, today I have the great opportunity to speak with someone I have wanted to talk to for quite a while. Actually I've wanted to talk to for about two decades, really. I first heard of him back when I was working with ***Grant Richter*** on the Wired Synthesizers system, this composer called up and wanted to start working on putting a system together. And he became one of the stalwarts of the Wired Synthesizer user base. But his name came up in several other interviews and we've finally been able to get hooked up here and I very happy to have a chat with Gary Chang. Hey Gary, how's it going? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Thank you so much for taking the time out of your schedule to have this discussion. So I know you from this interaction at Wired, but I also know you from the incredible body of work that you had. If I look up IMDB they got you listed at like over 80 different projects that you worked on, which is just like an endless number of actual compositions and stuff. Why don't you fill us in a little bit about that body of work and what are some of the highlights of that? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Gary: </b>
    Well, I've always portrayed myself an obscure electronic music composer, whose side gig is scoring Hollywood movies and tv shows. I got into scoring movies by being a session musician in the eighties, which eventually led me to work with ***Giorgio***. The first job I did with ***Georgio*** was A Never Ending Story. So, who am I? Well, I'm a synthesizer arranger. So what do you do? You have, a composer asked you, here's a piece, here's the arrangement, can you basically put it together, electronicly? So you do it. And then the next time you get a call back, it's sort of, here's the piece its half arranged. Can you finish the arrangement and do the the electronics? And then the next step is here's the piece, can you arrange it like the last one?
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Gary: </b>
      So like eventually what happens is you generate more confidence from the people who work with. And so a couple of movies in, I ended up just ghosting the entire movie from ***Georgio*** called electric dreams. It was ***Virginia Madison's*** first movie. I didn't get any credits for it, but Georgia paid me handsomely and I got to score a Hollywood movie using his things. So I learned a lot about what I set out to eventually do for the next 35 years. The first movie that I actually have credit on is as additional music, on The Breakfast Club. And I contributed half an hour of music to that show. Other shows, the ones that everyone knows, I did ***understand, I did the Island of Dr. Mall***. I scored eight movies for ***John Rankin***. I worked with a number of notable directors in that, but as I said really, I'm a synthisist.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Gary: </b>
      Like ***Peter Grenada and Jill Fraser***, we all went to Cal arts together. We all studied ***Mort Subotnick*** together and had an amazing year with, the who's who of 20th century music wandering through the halls of Cal arts. I was a grad student. So, I have that background too. So it's an interesting thing. I mean, I'm kind of a Forrest Gump of electronic music. Presently I'm working on a little short for a filmmaker named ***Steven Saki*** and, Steve and I are once again, there were ***Cal artians*** and this is the third movie that we're working on. So I don't know exactly what we'll be all electronic. We're kind of at the early stages.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>That's an amazing overview. And I have to say that I was pretty shocked because I knew of some of the work that you had done, but I was really kind of blown away by the size of the list, quite frankly, and just a sense that this ha this represented a tremendous amount of work. Now, one of the things I especially noticed is that there were time periods where you did a phenomenal number of movie scores all in a single year. In doing this were you doing largely electronic scores or were you doing compositions that got orchestrated and performed by an orchestra? How did it work, where you were able to do so many different projects in a single year? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Gary: </b>
      Actually, they were all kind of all over the place. All of them employed a certain percentage of electronic and certain percentage of acoustic music. The larger the budget, the more orchestral and larger ensembles were used. It's interesting because part of the gift of my career was, I was able to work repeatedly for a number of filmmakers and that made it simple because less dating, so to speak.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Yeah, no doubt. You probably at some point you ended up with a kind of a shared language so that you could understand each other, right? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Gary: </b>
      Exactly. They had confidence that I could actually pull it off. I think for every young composer, when you first get a job, they want you because you're different and unique. For me about three quarters of the way through virtually every project, the filmmaker would call me up and say, Hey, I just wanted to ask, like, can you just like, do really normal things too? And you have to basically show that yes, I can, here's one. But you gotta think that coming from a background where, I've had had masterclasses with ***John Cajun and Elliot Carter***, and people like that. When you want to say, well, let's go outside. Well, I could get pretty far out on the Hollywood scene.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Gary: </b>
      I had a lot of fun doing it though. It was a lot of pressure. To be honest with you it doesn't make me upset that like I'm off the hot seat at this point. There's something wonderful about that. I feel like, once the pandemic really kind of just wrote it home, which is geez, not that much has changed here. I've been living and working out of my house for going on 40 years. It's kind of bizarre, maybe I was all set to do this. Right.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>You were well-prepared. You dropped a couple of hints about your background, but one of the things I like doing in my podcast is really digging into people's background and learning more about how they got to be the artists that they are. One of the things when we first looked up our zoom call, you're in your studio, surrounded by amazing synthesis technology. It's clear that with your background is sort of a session synthesis that you have a lot of facility with the technology of it, but you also have the musical chops to pull off this huge variety of tasks that's necessary to score a movie. I'm wondering where you're coming from, that all of these things sort of like fit the Gary chain mold. What was your background that drew you in the music? What's the background that drew you into technology? How did those things mesh? Was it in Cal arts? Was it in place long before then? And who are some of the people that really lit up the landscape for you and helped you become the artists that you are? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Gary: </b>
      Well, first of all my mom and dad, my mom and dad met in Boston. She was a student at new England conservatory of music. She was the mezzo soprano, and my father was getting his doctor of science at MIT. And this might reveal to where my background comes from. As my mom is a real musician who sang when we were growing up. I mean, we listened to music all the time, but my father was an engineer incidentally in mining engineer. His first job was at the university of Minnesota, which is why I was born in Minneapolis, But my father was a ***hi-fi buff*** and, he built a few stereo systems in the fifties. And so there's Gary downstairs in the basement, hanging out with his dad. Who was dad's soldering up a storm. And it sort of like, maybe it's the solder fumes or something that led me down this path of technology.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Gary: </b>
      That's one thing that happened. The second thing is I grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and when I applied to colleges, of course I got into Carnegie Mellon university, but I didn't want to stay in Pittsburgh. I ended up going to Tufts university in Boston for my first year of college. And I'll be honest with you I absolutely hated it. I really didn't like it. As a matter of fact, in January of that year I auditioned for Carnegie Mellon and I got into Carnegie Mellon, I transferred to Carnegie Mellon the following year. And, the interesting thing about Boston though, is it gave me the spring semester where essentially I took conducting and piano lessons and modern dance and just really kind of fucked off that spring.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Gary: </b>
      Except I'm in one of the student lounges in a quadrangle one afternoon and I'm just playing the piano. And a gentleman came in and sat down and listened for a moment. After a while we got into a conversation and we talked about music and eventually my opinion of Boston came out and I said, I hate living here. And he asked why, and i said it is because it's just a city of screaming children, you go to a concert and you can't hear the music because everyone's in the audience yelling. So he was really nice. He said, what are you doing Friday? I said nothing nothing, and he said, well look, I'm going to take out to dinner and I wanted to show you my Boston. So I went out and we had a really nice dinner and we walked up Boylston street and he took me to the jazz workshop. Were standing in line and I said to him I hope you realize I'm 18 years old, I can't get in. At the time the drinking age in Boston was 21. So the gentleman pulls out his driver's license and at the time Massachusetts driver's licenses didn't have pictures on them, he says, look, five-eight, black hair, Brown eyes here use my drivers.
    </p>


    <p>
      <b>Gary: </b>
      So, I'm kind of uptight. I'm going to get thrown out of here, but they let me in. And I, there it is. I walk in and at jazz workshop that evening is the Herbie Hancock sex Ted. And there's Herbie with his Rhodes and a Wawa and the echo of Plex and all this stuff. And, and, you know, this place is like church. It was packed and everyone loved the hell out of music. And of course I did too, but I got a chance to actually meet Herbie during a break and got to ask him about the structure of the music and all this kind of stuff. And anyway, after the end of the evening, I'm just completely blown away by it, then, you know, well, thank you, man. I really appreciate it. You know, here's your driver's license back. And he said, Oh, no, just keep it. I'll get none
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Gary: </b>
      Spring. I saw Herbie's band again. I saw, you know, two albums, one D she set, and I saw the crossing set. I S I sat five days, three sets a night through all of that. It was amazing. I saw miles miles with Keith Jarrett. I saw a return to forever. I saw weather report completely changed. It completely changed my thinking about what music was part of. It was because of the humans, right? These guys were actually making a living. These guys were actually dressed well, they were playing. They're having fun. They were getting paid to do. That was something that was amazing, you know, and it wasn't this frumpy academic or classical music path. It was something different. Right. So when I got to Carnegie Mellon, the interesting thing about that is Carnegie Mellon was like, well, that's really great, but deal with that later right now is a conservatory.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Gary: </b>
      This is conservative. You're going to learn harmony counterpoint. You're going to learn the basics. This is what we're going to do. So I was completely resigned to that. I thought, well, okay, this sort of takes out, I'll do it. You know, in the spring of 73, I guess what happens is Paul Devorah ***<inaudible>*** until recently was a professor at North Texas state. And he w you know, but when I knew him, he was a PhD in composition student at Carnegie Mellon. And he came into the composers forum one afternoon and said, Hey, Carnegie Mellon just scored an artificial intelligence grant that only at this point, MIT and Stanford have had. So the first thing they did was they went and they bought the bell laboratories library of software, and in it included music software. So, is there anyone who's interested in this, two of us raised our hands, the computer science department gave us $10,000 of computer time.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Gary: </b>
      And then you got to remember, this is 1972, right. We could like literally live at the computer center for $10,000. Right. So for that, that was the thing is for the next three years, we messed around with this, and it was kind of a strange thing. It was Stanford score and music 10, and, you know, basically going over to the computer center and with the tech set or writing some scripts and then sending them down then running across the campus to, another room that had a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data">PD</a>P, a 10 in it, which is a hybrid. So we could take the digital analog converters and plug them into an amplifier and hear the, literally hear like five seconds of noise and go, okay, that's what we did. You know, I mean, that's the funny thing is that that was my background in technology. They had an ARP 2,600 there too.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Gary: </b>
      So it's like for me, I'm channeling my, Keith Jarrett, Joseph Alvin, or Herbie Hancock chick, Korea, want to be vibe and dragging around a Rhodes piano with Echoplex. And, and then, you know, the 2,600 to do, interesting different gigs and stuff like that around Pittsburgh while studying actual, you know, computer code and stuff like that, and getting my, bachelor's degree in music composition. So that's kind of, that's the funny thing is like, it wasn't Cal arts that widened my perception. Initially. It was something else, right. It was that semester in Boston made realize. So where I met Patrick Gleason, you know, people I've known for years.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Gary: </b>
      That's why I say I'm kind of like, you know, forest gum, right. How did I end up meeting these people? And, you know, then a few years later I'm standing there having conversations with Jacob Druckman or Morton Feldman, or, you know, it's really, and then later on, you know, like as in pop music, I got, got to work with my heroes. I got to work with weather report. I spend a day editing a piece of music with Jocko.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Unreal. How did you make the move from the East coast to the West coast? What, what made that transition? Was it to go to Cal arts or did you head that direction anyway? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Gary: </b>
      Well, it all dawned on me that there are a wider horizons other than Pittsburgh, you know, no offense to my Pittsburgh friends, but I ended up going, you know, the interesting thing is Richard Corrigan, the first president of Cal arts was an ex Dean of the fine arts college at Carnegie Mellon university. And he moved from Carnegie Mellon to NYU. And that's where he started the first multimedia art program, which included Subotnick and Mel pal and nom, June pike. And all of these people wandered out to California to Cal arts, with Cal arts was created, right. You could go to Carnegie Mellon and find the Cal arts catalogs in the library. So there was some sort of bizarre linked to it. Although aesthetically, you know, Cal arts is really was a new music for the music department. What was a new music satellite, you know? And, I cut my teeth with Mort, basically helping him do his projects, know we did the game room and we did, the first ghost pieces and stuff like that. Just helping him technically, this is basically, you know, it was an amazing experience. And, I have a lot of gratitude towards Mort what I learned with him.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Yeah. Yeah. Well, it sounds like an amazing experience. And, and, you know, I know so many people who've gone through the calorie systems in many generational passes, but it always seems like it's a place where groups of people kind of come together and, and become sort of a generation of artists. You know, they kind of clump together at Cal arts and then, and then expand out. Right. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Gary: </b>
      The funny thing about it though, is we're, you know, Wayne Sloss and said, this one, I met him after I had went to Cal arts. And he said, you know, all of you guys from Cal are so different. I can't for the life of me codify what you guys are or what you do. It's so diverse. Right. And that's really the interesting mystique of calories, you know, I mean, it's really, the odd thing about it is it's the realization that Cal arts was like studying with the Dalai Lama, you know, but it's not everything I don't have to sit there and dressed back wax romantically about my experience at Cal arts. You know, it's just another one of those things. I mean, I loved my experience as a professional, you know, I mean, I don't know. I had a lot of fun doing what I've done in my life.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Yeah. So you're, you're saying you're, you don't have to just be romantic romanticizing, Cal arts, because it's just part of a long, the long time. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Gary: </b>
      Exactly. And it's sort of like one thing is meeting Herbie Hancock in the club when I'm 18. And then, you know, the next thing is when I'm 21, having that a masterclass with, you know, Elliot Carter and, you know, people like that. And then a few years later, I'm like in a recording studio with Robbie Robertson or a lot or Giorgio Moroder. And, that's the thing that's really funny is, part of the bizarre aspect of it for me is, well, does being Chinese have anything Chinese American have anything to do with it? You know, maybe it does because it's like, I don't really fit any of the molds. You know what I'm saying? Like when you walked into the record plant, maybe now is different, but back in the seventies, you hardly ever saw any Chinese people or any Asian people, you know, involved in the music and the music business. So I think it's interesting because on one side of it, you know, and I was involved with technology, so I could just kind of ride my stereotype. Right.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Yeah. That makes sense. So the, the way that you started getting into session work then was it simply because both through Carnegie Mellon and your interactions at Kelarts, especially working with Morton who, you know, which is gonna like be a masterclass in synthesis techniques, is it just that you had enough facility that you could kind of go into this new world and help people realize their dreams? Was that, was that how you made your honor? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Gary: </b>
      No, not, well, here's the thing, man. It's like, you gotta think like, well, first of all, when I got out of grad school, I was broke just like everybody else. But you know, one thing I managed to do was I managed to manipulate my situation to, and build my surge modular system. And that's another, the next group of people that probably to discuss in my career, that's important, you know, is surge and the group of people that's rounds at that, the lab in Hollywood. It's interesting because, well, it's hard to figure out what are you going to do with your life? You know, you just got out of school and you feel like, well, I've accomplished this and this and this, but you go out and you show your wears around. And for me, you know, half of them were saying, you know, it's not good enough was I, you know, I spent six months writing this piece, so, okay, well, you know, Brahms spent 17 years writing this first step,
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Gary: </b>
      The back door, you know, half of the people would say that and the other half would say, this is fantastic. Let's go in the studio tomorrow and make 10 of them. Oh, you know, so it's sort of like, Oh, I get it. I don't have the chops here one way or other. So, you know, part of it for me was I was broke. I needed to figure out how to do all this stuff. And so I set out and I tried to study trying to figure out how to interface, you know, because I just spent six years in academia learning all this other stuff, not listening to the radio or anything. So the amazing thing that happened was I got, I found a brochure at a studio. Someone had brought in and it was for the Fairlight CMI. And basically, you know, Fairlight, Jordy Hormel had just bought the Fairlight distribution for the U S and he opened an office at the village recorder. So I marched down there with my resume and I got the job as a product specialist. And it's an interesting thing because this is where you got To go around County and showing people how it worked.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Gary: </b>
      Not just around town road, did all the trade shows. We did the computer music convention. So like suddenly it enabled popper Gary to like, afford to get around and the meat, everyone involved. Right. So, I mean, eventually what happens is I leave, I left Fairlight and started doing session work for people who own the Fairlight. And, you know, one of those people was Patrick Williams is a film composer who did a lot of stuff, but probably, you know, him for like the Mary Tyler Moore show and Luke grant and, you know, bunch of things like that. But he's an amazing jazz, you know, your brains for Sinatra, a lot different things. And I found working for people like this were amazing. I, I found myself on the soundstage with the team of LA recording musicians and I was the worst is I'll be the first one to say, not a great reader, but I learned so much, you know, once again, it's like being the journeymen, right. Eventually I'm going to try to be a composer, right. I need to know all about this. Right. And there's no better way than standing right in the middle of it. You know, that eventually after working for a few years in the studio scene, eventually I met Giorgio Moroder and got to work with him and, led to, my work and the breakfast club and my first credit there. And you know, that point on, I start working, you know, on my own.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Yeah. Now the interesting thing is that, you're S you're starting, this was at a kind of a peculiar timeframe because it was well before the computerization of a lot of this stuff, the technology you literally surfed all of the technology changes practically that we've, that we've seen in modern music in the process of doing scoring. Right. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Gary: </b>
      Absolutely. I mean, you know, you think, think about the whole concept of automation, right? Subotnick is a pioneer, his player, piano technique of right. Taking oscillators and recording fluctuations of volume on audio tape, and then playing the back to our envelope detectors, which would convert the fluctuations back into voltages. Right. And then, you know, Dawn creating the 10 channel fixed filter bank that basically Mort could actually tune oscillators to pass only through the discreet 10 banks. He could put 10 oscillators on one track and play them back through the filter individual end of load detectors and get all 10 control voltages for pan a. And you know, so anyway, you have that. And then when the Fairlight came to town, I mean, we spent months working on a proper way to synchronize it so that, you know, we could put a guide track on a two-inch tape machine, and then we could do multiple passes and sync, right. To something that is like commonplace today. But, you know, like I said, this is back in the days when, well, if we don't do it, no one's going to do it. Right.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>I think it's an important thing because yeah, realistically, now, if you're working to film, you'll just kind of like dump a mini version of the film onto your DAW and work right along with the picture. I mean, I, I was involved sort of like on the tail end of that, where, where there was like synchronization with tape machines and stuff, it was an extraordinary headache, but I was doing it on this tiny world. You were doing it in this huge, in these huge systems. I can't even imagine the technology and the stress involved in doing sync. I, it just is mind boggling given how our technology is today. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Gary: </b>
      Well, it's, it is pretty amazing, like the whole idea of the fact that, Oh, you're doing a feature film. So they shoot that and they plug a transformer into the wall. And basically everything's referenced to this 60 cycle tone, right after you were the film and audio is recorded synchronized to that, then it's transferred to video for editing. Well, it basically changes speed 1% in order to fit the 20, instead of it being 24 frames per second, it's 29, nine, seven frames per second. Right. And it's like, so now there's a speed fluctuation. And you do the entire post production in a different speed than the movie. And then finally it's dubbed it. It comes back down and it's pulled down in speed to synchronize with the 24 frames a second. Now, you know, it's like totally insanity insight. You know, when HD came out, wow, what a danger it's suddenly like, we, we don't have to go nuts anymore.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Gary: </b>
      I mean, yeah. That's our on projects that involved, Oh, well, you know, we need source music. You have to produce for the shoot and they're going to do something on the camera with, with the source music. That's it does, you have to record the music off-speed right. And then basically they play it so that when they play it on camera and they transfer it, the video, it's the same pitch as the original, you know? So anyway, yes, it was totally insane, but you're right. My career went all the way from Sprockets to a hard drive.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Yeah. That's, that's amazing. Just the history you got to see in the making. What's interesting is, I didn't know this, but we actually have another intersection of people. You mentioned that Paul Dvorak was someone that was involved in Carnegie Mellon. He was a, he was a composition teacher for me when I was at North Texas. And yeah, it's, it's funny how that works, but just bringing him up. He, what I, how I remember him was as a person who was like really dialed theory, he loved teaching theory. He loved having people honor theory and all that. And, you know, it makes me realize, so some of the people in your background are these very theory driven, very conventional musicians and composer types, but then all of the influence of Cal arts plus all of the influence of the, of the jazz people that you were following were like pulling you in a completely different direction. Where was the balance for you of utilizing the things you learned in theory and composition classes, combining them with the free flow of Herbie's bands or whatever, and combined with sort of the conceptual conceptual head rush that comes from talking to John cage, how do you pull these things all together? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Gary: </b>
      You know, the hard part about being an artist, especially a commercial artist is the fact that you're going to get a lot of criticism. And then the truth is you just have to do the best you can, you know? So what does that mean? And how does that distill itself down to an aesthetic? You know, and the truth is, is it's a question of like, whether you can write music that actually gets people to react, right? I mean, this is something that's really funny is for years until I met John Frankenheimer, I was writing really cool music and people liked it. But when I met John, he wanted something that was cool, but he didn't really like that kind of music. He, he wanted me to write music that made people cry. He wanted me to be, you know, I mean, in retrospect, God blessed John.

      I mean, you asked me to be the movie for a moment in that regard, first of all, there, aren't just aren't that many people who get to do that, especially in movies done the level of the John Frankenheimer directed, there's a movie, a Andersonville to civil war movie. So obviously there's no electronic music instruments on this movie. Right, right. And here we are, it's like, we're spotting the movie and this is a mini series. And, here we are five minutes from the end of the entire thing. And John gets up and goes, okay, well there's music from now to the rest of the movie. There's no dialogue. There's, there's this music. So that's it. I got to go, I'll see you later. Like at first you think about this and you're like, Holy shit, this is really insane. But the truth is, it's a gift, right?

      It's you know, who gets to be yourself in front of millions of people, very, very fortunate to have met the filmmakers I work with and, you know, get pad, continence for me to be Gary, you know, and the truth is, is that all the various experiences I had, they encouraged me to wear a different colored shirt at the time that I was into it. You know, in the reality of life, eventually you have to be yourself. If you're not, you're making a big mistake, you know what I'm saying? It's like, how often do you get a chance to write something that, you know, that millions of people are going to hear? So it's like, you might as well be you. And that that's the funny thing is, you know, I know what the next question is, which is how do you know what you is? Right?

      <i>Exactly. Especially when you can change a lot over a long period of time. You've been, you have been composing for an extraordinary time period. The U of U has changed a lot during that period. </i>

      <b>Gary: </b>
      Yes. You know, the reality is it's about that evolution that enables you to be an educated writer. It's like, if everything stayed the same, and that's where I see my friends who are a pop artists and how, you know, how hard it must be to be James Taylor, right. And play fire and rain at the end of every concert for the rest of your life. I'm not saying that there's something wrong with that. Right. What it is, is at the same time, you know, that's a question, you ask him in an interview and he'll say, you know, like I've, I've been through fire and rain with that song. Right. So like, I love it. And I hate it. And you know, and in the end, like my fans love it. So I'm playing it for him, you know? So there's a gift and incredible gift. As the film composer, when a director says, be the movie and next year you don't have to be the movie. Well, there are movies that are huge musical hits that everyone mimics for the rest of your lives, like Shawshank Redemption or something like that. But I think that's the, that was the exciting part of my, my career is like, yeah, I got to be me for a second.

      <i>Well, Gary, unfortunately our time is up. But, what a beautiful story. I have one last question, for people who want to hear your scoring work, generally speaking, you can go and find, and listen to existing scores, but you also talk about your own personal music, the development creations that you've done work, where might people be able to listen to some of those, </i>

      Ah, you know, to come over to your house? This is the funny thing is I have no problem being an Emily Dickinson in this, you know, I mean, in the end, it's like, I've led a private life as much as they possibly have been able to. And it's not to say that I don't want to share my reason. I suppose, if you wander around my Facebook page, you'll, you'll find some links in some of my, posts there to stuff, but I don't really have a, a huge spot where I just basically showing all that stuff. And I'm sorry about that to whoever's interested in, but as I said, you know, it's sort of my music making, I make it, I have an analogy here. This might be interesting for, for this, Darwin. I have a metaphor for artists and artists are people who like to stand out in the middle of the stream.

      They stand out in the middle of the water. They're like watching the water rush by. And meanwhile, everyone that's on the shore sits there and says, what the fuck are you doing? You know? And then one day, a fish swims down the stream and into your pocket. And everyone on the shore goes, Oh, I get it. You're a fishermen. And then they spend all their time talking to you about fishing. But the reality is all you really like to do is stand out in the middle of the street, you know? And I think that's the truth about electronic music. That's true. It's about music in general. I'm still fascinated by it. I'm happy that I had, you know, I'm happy to have an excuse to have spent most of my life. And most of my resources on this crazy electronic music thing, it's really been an amazing, fascinating thing, you know?
