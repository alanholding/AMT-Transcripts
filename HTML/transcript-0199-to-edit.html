<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, today I have the great pleasure of getting to, talk to somebody new. Her name's Jill Fraser She's somebody that was introduced, to me by, the friends and family over on Facebook. So thanks all for that. I did a drive by on our website and there were so many areas of interest that we share, and so I was really looking forward to having a chat. I reached out, she was into it, and so, we're off and running. So with that, I will introduce you to Jill Frazier. Jill, how are you? Hi. Hi. Thanks so much for taking Good, happy to be here. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill Fraser: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="50.125" data-end_ts="50.285" title="50.125" id=c_"50.125">__Yeah__</span>, thanks so 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Much. Thanks for taking the time outta your schedule to talk. I really appreciate it. Why don't we, why don't we start off by having you give us a quick overview of the work that you do? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b>Well, I am a composer. I've written music my, my entire life, and pretty much everybody's probably heard me because I've done, literally hundreds of TV commercials. But my main focus has always been electronic music. That's my instrument. I have a, a big <span style="color:red" data-ts="80.725" data-end_ts="81.045" title="80.725" id=c_"80.725">__surge__</span> modular. I worked at <span style="color:red" data-ts="82.965" data-end_ts="83.285" title="82.965" id=c_"82.965">__Surge__</span> and I went to Cal Arts, and I'm currently not doing so many commercials anymore. I'm, kind of retired from that, and I'm focusing on my own experimental, I guess that's what most people call it, electronic music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I had, the opportunity to kinda watch some of the performance work that you had put up on your website, which is joe fraser music.com. I'll have it on the show notes for people to check out. But, it was really interesting, to see, first of all, you don't see that many people taking their surge out into the wild. So that was, pretty cool to see <laugh>. But also it was great to see you doing the kind of work that you were doing. I thought it was, it was beautiful, but I also found it to be very compositional in a way that a lot of times you don't hear <span style="color:red" data-ts="137.465" data-end_ts="137.685" title="137.465" id=c_"137.465">__in__</span> electronic, in particularly in live modular based music. It <span style="color:red" data-ts="141.965" data-end_ts="142.005" title="141.965" id=c_"141.965">__was__</span>, it was really composition heavy, which I think is a nod to, to the work that you've done there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b>You know, I, <span style="color:red" data-ts="148.245" data-end_ts="148.525" title="148.245" id=c_"148.245">__that__</span> you're not the first person to say that. I tend to not think about it too much, but people tend to describe it as very compositional or cinematic. <span style="color:red" data-ts="157.695" data-end_ts="158.045" title="157.695" id=c_"157.695">__Right__</span>. I guess that's just kind of, kind of where I live. I've been currently doing some, performances with Peter Grenada, occasionally with <span style="color:red" data-ts="168.765" data-end_ts="169.045" title="168.765" id=c_"168.765">__Chad__</span> Smith. We have this little group we call the <span style="color:red" data-ts="171.825" data-end_ts="172.045" title="171.825" id=c_"171.825">__Zik__</span> Society, which is basically a way for us to play our competitions and then get other people to play along with us. Right. So we've been doing those things. Yeah. I think that I have a lot of experience doing film scores and, and of course TV stuff. So I tend to, to think that music needs to start here and take you, take you someplace. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So, yeah. So that is, that's kind of what it sounds like, I guess. Right. I, I'm not trying to tell a story. I just, I, it's more like architecture. I'm kind of like building a, a, a building for you to explore, I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Guess. Right. You know, maybe when I talk about it being compositional, that's what I'm hearing is sort of like the development of structure in a, in a pretty deliberate way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b>Yeah. I <span style="color:red" data-ts="222.605" data-end_ts="222.765" title="222.605" id=c_"222.605">__think__</span> I, I think so. I think, gosh, I'm, I'm not real good at, at talking about it, but I do kind of, it's not like I necessarily plan out a structure ahead of time. Right. But I think that I do have, you know, I'm not like looking at, okay, I'm gonna write a piece that's in this form. I don't think about it that way. Right, right, right. But at some point, <span style="color:red" data-ts="242.405" data-end_ts="242.525" title="242.405" id=c_"242.405">__a__</span>, something, a structure starts to appear and then you kind of have to follow it and build it up and make the walls and, and make sure that it's, that you're going on a, on a voyage. Sure. And you want a beginning, something exciting to happen in the middle and, you know, some kind of a respite at the end. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, you mentioned that you perform primarily on a large surge system. What does large mean to you? Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b>You know what, I have been, I do take my surge out, but recently I've been taking it out less. And I have a small one panel surge that, Dmitri Bronson up in San Francisco built for me. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And then I've been taking the laptop and, I've got a push, a push <span style="color:red" data-ts="287.505" data-end_ts="287.725" title="287.505" id=c_"287.505">__too__</span>, and, and, and taking those out. 'cause I do need to have that structure. I have performed, I do perform live with, with the big surge, but, but honestly, it's getting kind of old and there's always something that's, that's coming loose and not, not quite right. <laugh> and, <laugh>. And I just can't quite tolerate the risk of things going horribly, horribly wrong. I just, I feel too much responsibility to all the people who are sitting there listening 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Right. Well, I hear, I hear that. And I, I used to have a, an eight <span style="color:red" data-ts="321.295" data-end_ts="321.645" title="321.295" id=c_"321.295">__panel__</span> search system, which I loved. Yeah. But it was, it was some, you know, some of the panels were quite old. It was starting to get cranky. Right. And the problem is, I don't have the electronic chops to do any of the work myself. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b>There was a time when I could do it myself, but not anymore. Yeah. Right. I, you know, I don't wanna take the time to do that. It's a whole, you know, it's a whole thing in itself to, to get into that. So yeah. Rex probe or, Kevin <span style="color:red" data-ts="350.115" data-end_ts="350.405" title="350.115" id=c_"350.115">__Bini__</span> does that stuff, or Dimitri up in San Francisco. Yeah. Keeping, keeping it all up and running. And I've been doing a lot of, or a few performances out in the desert, and, some of them are off road, and so hearing it bounce around in the back of the car kind of makes me upset. So, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, I can hear that. Right. Oh my God, that's terrifying. Just to even think 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b>About it. Yeah. It's a little upsetting. So, so, yeah, so the little one panel is, is easy to take, and, and that, that seems to be, I do a lot of sampling of, of my surge at home, so I I'm going with that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, you mentioned that you have a push, too, which pretty well implies, you're using Ableton on these performances too. How much of what you're doing is sourced directly from the live surge? And how much is like stuff that you, kind of format and prepare ahead of time? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b>Oh, to be honest, I'd say that easily three quarters is, is prepared ahead of time. Okay. And then the live surge, for both processing and then things that are not particularly time sensitive. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know, I love the way my surge sounds. I love the, the oscillators. I've got a ton of oscillators and I, everything that analog sound, but when it comes to clocks and sequences and tempos, the computer does it really, really well. <laugh>, you're <span style="color:red" data-ts="444.165" data-end_ts="444.245" title="444.165" id=c_"444.165">__right__</span>. So <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, but I think it's interesting because frankly, a lot of people wanna pretend that they don't use the computer, but they do. And I am glad to hear you kind of talk specifically about this because it points to something else, which is that you can have prepared material and still be really improvisational in performance. Right. And I think maybe one of the reasons that I gravitated towards to live when it first came out was that that clip view sort of was a way that engaged me in sort of a performative way of working with material. Is that, is that what has you as well? Is that how you work? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b>Yes. Yeah. That's the obvious. Well, to me it seems like the obvious reason for using Ableton <laugh>. Right. For, for most of my compositional life, I've been a digital performer person. Oh, <span style="color:red" data-ts="497.245" data-end_ts="497.405" title="497.245" id=c_"497.245">__really__</span>? And I love Digital Performer. I used it since the very first version of it, with the ability to print out parts for musicians to play was a big, was, was real important to me. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> it was fast and easy for me to, to quickly print out a, a ton of parts. And that implementation was just really, really important. So, but, but then Ableton, of course, the clip view. Yeah. And the push is really an instrument in itself. I really like. I I like that. I like that. I don't have to use a computer keyboard for everything, and I can play, play this instrument. The push, which at this, at this stage of the game, to have this new instrument to learn is, is really cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> <laugh>. Yeah. Yeah. So, with the, it sounds like, you know, you were kind of hands-on with <span style="color:red" data-ts="549.135" data-end_ts="549.485" title="549.135" id=c_"549.135">__surge__</span>, surge creation, way back. How long have you had the system, you talk about this larger system that you have. How long have you had that and have you made, has it changed much over the years, or did you get it and it's become like your cello <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b><laugh>? Yeah. When, when I got <span style="color:red" data-ts="568.645" data-end_ts="568.925" title="568.645" id=c_"568.645">__outta__</span> Cal Arts, a group of us went to work at Surges in Hollywood. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, you know, we would take as much money as I needed to live on at the time, or a little bit of money to live on, and then take all the rest of our hours in, in gear. And so that's when I got my surge. Wow. And I've had like, a ton of other synthesizers In addition to that, over the years, I've had, well, I had a lot of Oberheim gear 'cause I was friends with Ann Graham who worked at Oberheim. And so I would know about everything new that was coming out. Yeah. So I had, I had like a, a ton of other gear, but, the surges, well, I actually had a Moog three P at one point. It belonged to a composer that I, that I worked with Jack Nietzche. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b>I don't know if you know who he is. <span style="color:red" data-ts="619.645" data-end_ts="619.805" title="619.645" id=c_"619.645">__Yeah__</span>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="619.805" data-end_ts="619.925" title="619.805" id=c_"619.805">__It__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="619.925" data-end_ts="619.965" title="619.925" id=c_"619.925">__was__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="619.965" data-end_ts="620.245" title="619.965" id=c_"619.965">__quite__</span> an infamous film composer. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And he really gave me my big break in films. And he had a Moog three p and I had that for quite a while that he wasn't using it. I can tell you a funny, a weird story about that three PI took it apart 'cause I, 'cause some of the pots were, were dirty and I was gonna try to clean it up. And it's the three P that was in a movie, that the Rolling Stones were in called Performance. Yeah. And I took the back off of this thing and there were a bunch of like little wads of gum with birthday candles that were half burnt, stuck in the back of the modules. Wild. Huh. <laugh> of 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Course, <laugh>. It makes perfect sense somehow. <laugh> <laugh>. Yeah. That's wild. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b>And it <span style="color:red" data-ts="663.125" data-end_ts="663.245" title="663.125" id=c_"663.125">__was__</span> the movie. I mean, you could see in that, in that <span style="color:red" data-ts="665.265" data-end_ts="665.485" title="665.265" id=c_"665.265">__mo__</span> old movie, you can see the, <span style="color:red" data-ts="667.315" data-end_ts="667.605" title="667.315" id=c_"667.315">__that__</span>, that three P in there. Right. And it was that one, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Maybe that's how for the movie, that's how they lit up the lights. They couldn't actually figure out how to run it. So they figured, well, maybe some lights shine out of the jacks. That'll be cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b>That's the only thing that I can figure. It was, you know, regular little birthday candles, half burnt, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Second little 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="688.625" data-end_ts="688.845" title="688.625" id=c_"688.625">__Lot__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="688.905" data-end_ts="689.125" title="688.905" id=c_"688.905">__of__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Gum. Unbelievable. <laugh>. That's funny. That's funny. So tell me a little bit about your work in television commercials, your commercial work. That's one of the things I noticed from your site is the list of commercial clients you have is remarkable in its length. Right. And you've done a lot of work for on commercials. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b>Yeah. I've, I've been really, really lucky because I've never done anything, to make money other than write music. So that in itself was incredibly lucky. <span style="color:red" data-ts="721.705" data-end_ts="721.925" title="721.705" id=c_"721.705">__And__</span> no kidding. Most of that money came from TV commercials. And I've probably done like three or 400 that have gone to air the first three years that Lexus was launched. I did all of the spots for Lexus. I did a lot of BMW for a long time. I did just tons and tons of cars. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I noticed a lot of car, a lot of car brands on there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b>Yeah. And oddly enough, well mostly luxury import cars. My first big car spot was Porsche, which I did for Chiat Day. And I did several Porsche spots for them. And, they were very electronic. They were very, they were all surged. They were, yeah, they were just completely electronic. And gosh, that had to be back probably like around 1980 mm-Hmm. <affirmative> maybe even earlier. And, yeah. 'cause Porsche doesn't do TV anymore. And then the, some of the producers from there in particular, Francesca Cone went to, Saatchi and Saatchi. And then <span style="color:red" data-ts="785.165" data-end_ts="785.445" title="785.165" id=c_"785.165">__when__</span> Saatchi and Saatchi opened up Team one to deal with Lexus, she brought me in on Lexus. And we did all of those. Interesting. All those spots. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. What was it about your work that drew them in? I mean, you know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b>Oh, it <span style="color:red" data-ts="799.645" data-end_ts="799.685" title="799.645" id=c_"799.645">__was__</span> the electronics for sure. It was the, the gloss <span style="color:red" data-ts="802.805" data-end_ts="802.925" title="802.805" id=c_"802.805">__of__</span> it. Modular stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I'm just, <span style="color:red" data-ts="805.395" data-end_ts="805.685" title="805.395" id=c_"805.395">__what__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b>I'm wondering, <span style="color:red" data-ts="806.525" data-end_ts="806.645" title="806.525" id=c_"806.525">__I__</span> think the drive, I, it was all very, this sort of driving repetitive thing. It was not Philip Glass, but it was very repetitive sequencer based stuff. I see. Okay. And I personally think it went great with cars because it's motion, it's drive, it's, also sits under a voiceover very well. Right. So then there was that. But then with commercials, what's really, really cool is just that you do lots and lots of different styles. And because, you know, I had a big classical music background. I could do, I could pick up pretty much any style. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So, and plus you have a nice budget, so you can hire like whoever you want to play on stuff. So like, if I had something that was required blues, which isn't necessarily my mil, I could call Paul Butterfield and have him come in and play. Right, right. So, <laugh>, you never got bored, that's for sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, no kidding. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b>Yeah. I ended up doing a lot of cars and I think it was mostly the electronic stuff. And then I did a bunch of like, health spa stuff. Valleys all things that require a lot of motion. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and, drive. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I've never really thought about it, but it does make sense. You know, if I just think about it in the context of cars, I mean, there's a lot about a sequencer that, that parallels the way, like a internal combustion engine works, I guess. Yeah. But also the idea of like, of like flying past, you know, 'cause they always seem to be like driving through like semi <span style="color:red" data-ts="900.465" data-end_ts="900.885" title="900.465" id=c_"900.465">__desert__</span> or something. So you're always flashing past like tumbleweeds and stuff. <laugh> and there's a lot of visuals that match up with the sequence track. I can see it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think, I think, I think it goes really well. So I really enjoy doing those spots. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So I'm kind of curious if, if you were doing these kind of things back in the eighties, in the early eighties and maybe even late seventies, this is certainly, this certainly predates the time when, home studios were common. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b>Oh, yeah. It didn't, didn't do anything <span style="color:red" data-ts="935.325" data-end_ts="935.525" title="935.325" id=c_"935.325">__at__</span> studios. Yeah. I practically lived at Village Recorders 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Oh, okay. Alright. I was wondering where you did your work and how often did you actually work with other musicians, or was it sort of like a solitary sit in the room and, and tweak on it until it came together? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b>I feel like I, I really made a point of I would do my electronic tracks and I would often send those in as part of the, of the demos. And then we'd go in and I would every possible opportunity bring players into play on top of them. So, I mean, why not? I had the, I had the budget and LA's full of the best players in the world. Why would I miss this opportunity? Right. So I would bring in like Jim Kelner played on a bunch of spots for me. How lucky and amazing is that <laugh>. Oh my God. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's incredible. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, I had these great guys come in all the time and play and play over my electronic stuff. That was what I thought of is my sound. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Very interesting. Now, the other thing I noticed on your, on your site that I'm really curious about, is that you, it says you toured with, Buffy St. Marie. Yeah. <laugh>, which at first blew me away because I just think of her as a folkie. Right. But I actually was like, I was so curious. I went and I just like typed in, Buffy St. Marie electronic music. And it turns out that she feels like she has been doing electronic music since forever. I had no idea. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b>I met her because, well, because of Jack Nietzche and I was working in, she was working on a movie called Spirit of the Wind. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, which was about the dog races in Alaska. I got to know her. She heard some of my stuff and her kind of pow <span style="color:red" data-ts="1052.625" data-end_ts="1052.845" title="1052.625" id=c_"1052.625">__wow__</span> Indian singing over those electronic tracks. It was so much fun to do that. And I think it sounded great. She thought it sounded great. So, I did a little bit of touring with her, which was, you know, real exciting for me. Of course, that would've been early eighties. Okay. And I brought the ser with me to, to Europe for that and to Canada for that. Wow. Yeah. And we had to have, you know, have, transformers and stuff for it. Right. And yeah. Yeah. I have a, I have a gigantic, I have a gigantic road case for my search. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, you must. Which 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b>Most people don't have. It's a gigantic anvil case. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I dunno, though. I've seen enough bad images. For some reason, I have this propensity when I fly into a city and as my, as my plane taxis up to the, to the gate, I make the mistake of looking out the window at the people in the plane next door, dropping stuff out of the, the 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b>Compartment, the luggage 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Compartment. I've seen it happen enough that I'm like, I'm never putting an instrument in there. You know, it's just very scary to me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b>I know, I know. I had racks of outboard gear and I would always get like the two inches of foam all the way around. Right. So that, and, and so the, the road cases, and I don't know what to do with them. I have just enormous road cases. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I have a whole big storage space dedicated to them. <laugh>. Wow. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So when you were touring, when you were touring with Puffy, what, what kind of, what kind of work was it? Were you doing? Were you just like putting together sequences that she would play and sing over? Or was it Yeah. Part of a, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1157.525" data-end_ts="1157.685" title="1157.525" id=c_"1157.525">__and__</span> basically, or was it part of a bigger group scenario? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b>A couple of times we went out with, with a band, but then I would have my pieces that I did with her and they would be sort of the same kind of sequencer stuff. Yeah. The same kind of sequencer stuff that was, that I was doing on the commercials. Sure. Very similar. And then I would also play some <span style="color:red" data-ts="1185.105" data-end_ts="1185.325" title="1185.105" id=c_"1185.105">__key__</span> keyboard parts. But I have to admit, I'm not the world's greatest keyboard player. So ultimately I ended up, she ended up <span style="color:red" data-ts="1191.605" data-end_ts="1191.845" title="1191.605" id=c_"1191.605">__meeting__</span>, more keyboards and, and I was also doing too well with the commercials to Right. Be able to afford to go out 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1199.925" data-end_ts="1200.125" title="1199.925" id=c_"1199.925">__And__</span> anything <span style="color:red" data-ts="1200.405" data-end_ts="1200.525" title="1200.405" id=c_"1200.405">__to__</span> drive, drive around the country or drive around Canada, I guess. Right. So I'm, I'm curious. We've talked already, we've touched on a few things. You, you mentioned that you, you did, film scoring and film work. You did all this work as a composer and performer on commercials. You, toured with people doing, doing stuff. And you're currently actively a performer. Where do you come from? Where, where did you get sort of like both, and it's kind of like a two-prong thing. Where did you get the knowledge to do the things that you're doing, but also what in your background, kind of put you in a spot to feel comfortable and like maybe confident enough to put yourself in a position to do this stuff? I'm, I, I find it fascinating. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b>Well, I started piano when I was, when I was little, when I was like five years old. And the piano teacher that I had was this wonderful woman, Mrs. Gosling, who, had been a piano player in silent movie theaters. She was actually teaching my mother, and she would bring these coloring books, but they were coloring books where you colored in notes. There were, you know, staff and notes. And I'd sit there and color Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> while my mother was taking piano lesson, I guess. And then I was simultaneously, I, I, I guess I got a horrible ear infection and my hearing shut down until they renew removed my adenoids. And when they did that, I guess I became a big pain in the neck about wanting piano lessons. I think what must have happened is, is that I had, I lost the ability to hear, and then I got it back suddenly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b>And I was fascinated with sound at that point. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, she had me with these coloring books and she'd always had me write down music as well. And so it never occurred to me that, you know, didn't write music too. It just seemed part of the whole, the whole thing. And, you know, at the same time, I was learning how to read words. So it just was like another language. It was just, you know, we read and we did music and, and you write music. And so it never occurred to me that this was something unusual or at all. It just seemed real natural. So I always wrote music ever since I was little. And then I was at Girl Scouts and, somebody brought in a copy. It switched on Bach Mm-Hmm. And it was like, the light switch went off as I know it did for a whole bunch of other people too. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b>I was totally taken. And then it wasn't long after that since I had been writing music at the, I grew up in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. And at the, one of the college professors at the university there heard some stuff that I wrote. And he said, why don't you come and audition and sitting in on <span style="color:red" data-ts="1377.775" data-end_ts="1377.975" title="1377.775" id=c_"1377.775">__cl__</span> on some of my classes. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And that was Roger HeNe. And, and so, so I did, and at that point I heard Silver Apples and Wild Bull <laugh>, and I was just smitten. I just couldn't believe my ears. I just, I, I had to do that. I, I was so taken with the panning that I just couldn't contain myself. So I kind of probably stalked Mort Nik <laugh> every time he came to the East Coast. And he brought me out to, to go to Cal Arts. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b>So yeah. So that's, that's how that happened. <laugh> interesting. And I was his, he was my mentor, and then I was his teaching assistant. And then when I got out, I worked a little bit on, cloudless sulfur, doing control tracks. And so I got a real up close look at more in com composing Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, which is, you know, how you really learn how to be a composer is by watching another composer. Right. And then Mort got a call from, Warner Brothers. They wanted somebody to bring synthesizer over to work with Jack Nietzche. Jack Nietzche wanted somebody, and Mort didn't wanna do it. And he sent me, and I took the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1458.195" data-end_ts="1458.685" title="1458.195" id=c_"1458.195">__booklet__</span> from Cal Arts over there and worked on a movie called Hardcore, which starred George C. Scott. Right. And, and then I worked on a whole bunch of different movies with, with Jack. I worked on one called When You Come In Back Red Rider. It was a bunch of different movies and different sessions that I did with Jack and, yeah. So that it's, it was just sort of natural. It didn't occur to me that it was at all anything unusual to do. But apparently that did occur to some other people. <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, no doubt. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and then how did you get your first breaks into doing the commercial work? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b>Oh, we went on strike. Okay. With, with Jack. Of course, all of that was all union. I joined the union, which was, which was fantastic, which was great. But I'm a proud union musician now. And, we went on strike and we, I was walking the picket line with a friend and we kind of hashed this plan to make up a bunch of fake commercials. I mean, we weren't fooling anybody. We just made up 30 seconds of commercials and sent it around to advertising agencies and Yeah. And then got, got stuff from there. Of course, I had some film credits at that point, and I had an agent Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. I had a film agent because I had, had picked up some film credits. Right. So, yeah. So that's, that's what happened then. But it was because we couldn't, we couldn't do, movie scores. And we were walking the picket line over at Warner Brothers. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's, it's hilarious how, the few times that there were strikes, how often that represented changes. Not only in, I mean, it represented changes, first of all, in just how things were done, but how often that had a huge impact on people's lives and the work that they did. You know, oftentimes there'd be a strike and all of a sudden there'd be a whole new generation of composers crop up because they either, you know, played s scab <span style="color:red" data-ts="1582.905" data-end_ts="1583.105" title="1582.905" id=c_"1582.905">__role__</span>, or they got to know other people while they were walking the line. Or like, in your case, Uhhuh, you know, they just, they just ended up doing stuff in order to fill up the time. And it ended up being the reel that got them work, you know? Yeah. Seems like those strikes are actually pretty powerful ways of shaking things up, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b><laugh>. Well, yeah. I think that musicians, just because you're, you can't work for some reason or another. You're still, you're still making music. It's not like you stop doing it. So Right. That music's gotta go someplace. Something's gotta happen. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>True enough. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b>So I think that's what happens. And usually it's music that you make, that it's not for jobs. It's the most creative and gets you the next job. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> through, through all this stuff, the education that you got in Chapel Hill probably built up sort of like the basics of the basics of music theory and stuff like that. Where did you learn sort of like the composition and organizational skills necessary to be an actual composer? 'cause it's a big difference from learning some theory to being a composer and even watching Morton. That's one thing, but there's a lot of details you have to learn along the way. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b>Yeah. I, I think that started with Roger HeNe at, UNC because he, I would bring in my compositions and we'd work on those. And then I did some undergraduate work at East Carolina with Otto Henry. And that was, you know, composition teaching. He was teaching me composition then. And then of course, with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1681.365" data-end_ts="1681.645" title="1681.365" id=c_"1681.365">__Moore__</span> to <span style="color:red" data-ts="1681.905" data-end_ts="1682.125" title="1681.905" id=c_"1681.905">__Cal__</span> Arts. And I studied a little bit with Mel Powell <span style="color:red" data-ts="1685.265" data-end_ts="1685.485" title="1685.265" id=c_"1685.265">__at__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1685.485" data-end_ts="1685.645" title="1685.485" id=c_"1685.485">__Cal__</span> Arts Orchestration. I think mostly the orchestration. I, I learned orchestration with Mel Powell and on my own with the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1695.485" data-end_ts="1695.645" title="1695.485" id=c_"1695.485">__Can__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1695.695" data-end_ts="1696.045" title="1695.695" id=c_"1695.695">__Canen__</span> book. You know, when you, I just, you know, hunkered down and, and figure it out. And, but also following scores and looking at scores with, Roger Hena and Otto Henry, they had me study a lot of scores. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And how much, how much technology, 'cause again, this is, you know, since you were doing a lot of your work in the studio, did, was it still kind of on your head to learn a lot of the technology for like doing sync to video or sync to film? Or, or were there technicians that handled that stuff? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b>Well, that's a good, that's a good question. Because when I got out <span style="color:red" data-ts="1731.725" data-end_ts="1731.845" title="1731.725" id=c_"1731.725">__of__</span> Cal Arts and I started working on films, which was of course, thanks to Mor getting me that first job, over at Warner Brothers, I realized that I did not understand sync to film, and I didn't understand a click tracks. And so, there was a course offered over <span style="color:red" data-ts="1751.555" data-end_ts="1751.845" title="1751.555" id=c_"1751.555">__Todd__</span> on, engineering and, and film tracks. And so I'd go down to Todd every Tuesday night or whenever it was. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="1761.125" data-end_ts="1761.285" title="1761.125" id=c_"1761.125">__so__</span>, you know, I completed those classes there. So, so yeah. So I had not gotten that. And it was, it was, you know, I didn't wanna look like an idiot in the studio. So <laugh> I found a way to, to, to do that <laugh>. So, and that it couldn't be a better place. I mean, Todd <span style="color:red" data-ts="1775.805" data-end_ts="1775.925" title="1775.805" id=c_"1775.805">__a__</span> was a legendary film, film scoring stage, so it couldn't have been, been a better opportunity. And then I saw, saw sessions and there were composers who let me come and sit in at their sessions and just watch and see what was, how it all happened. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, and 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b>Elmer Bernstein once let me come and, and sit in, and Henry Mancini let me come and sit in. And so there were a lot of people that really, you know, would let me, let me come and watch. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But how did you get, how did you get the introduction to him? I mean, it's not like Henry Mancini's, like sitting at a Starbucks and you say, Hey Henry, can I come watch a session <laugh>? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b>Oh, no. You know, what happened with him was, oh, I, I also took a class, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1820.865" data-end_ts="1821.085" title="1820.865" id=c_"1820.865">__and__</span> after I got, this was after Cal Arts, I took a class in film scoring at UCLA. 'cause I was trying to fill in the, you know, the, the technique, you know, just the mechanics of, of film scoring. And so he shows up at, he showed up as a speaker at this class at UCLA, and he says he's, he's talking about how he did a piece for some film where he has two pianos <span style="color:red" data-ts="1845.525" data-end_ts="1845.725" title="1845.525" id=c_"1845.525">__out__</span> of tune. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And he says how he and I being a smart ass tripped up. Oh, well, Charles, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1853.045" data-end_ts="1853.165" title="1853.045" id=c_"1853.045">__I__</span> did that. Oh. And he was so kind and so gracious, and actually wrote me a letter afterwards saying, you know, that yes, that I was right. And how he was so charming and so gracious. And then that opened the door to having conversation. And I saw him, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1874.245" data-end_ts="1874.285" title="1874.245" id=c_"1874.245">__know__</span> I saw him <span style="color:red" data-ts="1874.925" data-end_ts="1875.045" title="1874.925" id=c_"1874.925">__in__</span> different places around town. And finally, you know, he let me come and sit in and hang. And it was, he was just the most gracious, nicest guy. And then I went back to Cal Arts and I was on a panel him, with him and me, and it was like the, the seasoned professional and the young newcomer. Oh, that's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So <span style="color:red" data-ts="1896.125" data-end_ts="1896.405" title="1896.125" id=c_"1896.125">__very__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1896.405" data-end_ts="1896.565" title="1896.405" id=c_"1896.405">__cool__</span>. That's awesome. That's really cool. What a, what a great opportunity. It's curious because I think one of the things that people don't necessarily understand about a place like LA or you know, New York is like this, London's kind of like this now, Berlin's getting to be like this, is that by being there, there are a million opportunities just under the surface. And if you have, again, enough confidence to kind of just like dive in, you'll, you'll find an opportunity, you'll find opportunities to interact with people that, you know, when you talk about it later, seem like they were, you know, magical or at least improbable. Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1937.705" data-end_ts="1937.925" title="1937.705" id=c_"1937.705">__So__</span> that's kind of what the, what these environments provide. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b>I think you're absolutely right. I think that, and it, I never even thought of myself. It's having any confidence to speak of, but I was really curious and I just really wanted to know, wanted to know, wanted to know. So if you poke around enough, and then plus, once I got an agent, the agent would send me out to different studios and stuff to meet people. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And then once I was on the lot someplace, I'd go poking my nose into different rooms. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, but see, there again, why wouldn't you? Well, I know you see that, except for a lot of people, it's sort of like, you know, we were all taught to keep, you know, stay within lines, keep our arms inside of the car, windows, you know, all those kind of things. And, and, you have to be a little bit of a rule breaker to, to put yourself in a, in those kind of positions. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b>Yeah. Or to be stupid enough to not even know that there are rules <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, there's, that's possible too. Right. Good point, <laugh>. Good point. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But I just think, I just think of you as, as, you know, the the way that you weave your story, you do it in a very, kind of like a, a laid back way, but, you know, going all the way back to being just a, a young kid who didn't know that you weren't supposed to be able to write music. So you're doing it, and somehow this music tumbles into the lap of, you know, quite a renowned composition teacher. I mean, that, that doesn't, you know, that doesn't happen to wallflowers. It really doesn't. It's an amazing opportunity. And, and I'm just, it's interesting to hear that you, that it happened, but you also then took advantage of the opportunity. I think that's what a lot of people forget, is that not only does the opportunity have to present itself, but you have to take advantage of it too. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b>Well, I, yeah, absolutely. I think if you want to, you know, you just, what's the, old saying, I've been terrified my entire life, but I never let it stop me from doing anything I really wanted to do. Right. <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Nice. Yeah. Yeah. So did you ever get in your, in way over your head? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b>I suppose so, but, but never, yeah. I, I, I think so, but, but you just kind of keep working way at it until you solve the problem to the best of your ability. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So like, what's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2091.825" data-end_ts="2091.905" title="2091.825" id=c_"2091.825">__an__</span>, what's one of the worst things? I mean, just kind of like, you know, in your, you know, if you delve into your reptile brain, what is the, what's something that you got yourself into that scared you a little bit? I did some studio work in the past, and I remember one time getting into a gig that was <span style="color:red" data-ts="2106.625" data-end_ts="2106.825" title="2106.625" id=c_"2106.625">__way__</span> in over my head. Right. And there was <span style="color:red" data-ts="2109.425" data-end_ts="2109.665" title="2109.425" id=c_"2109.425">__like__</span> some terror in that, that I'll never actually shake <laugh>, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b>Yeah. Yeah. I, anything involving actually playing, what would require some real serious piano chops. There have been times when I've been on a gig that that really was for, that they want, they said they wanted synthesizer, but they really wanted somebody to, to play something. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> that, you know, really requires some chops and like jazz improvisational chops, which I really don't have. Right. And, yeah, there have been some times exactly what you just said where you're, where you're on a studio session and you realize that oh no, they really don't want you to make bleeps and bloops and make that sampler go, you know, make the sequencer <span style="color:red" data-ts="2157.995" data-end_ts="2158.285" title="2157.995" id=c_"2157.995">__that__</span> what they really want you is to play a bunch of jazz chords. And that's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2161.485" data-end_ts="2161.565" title="2161.485" id=c_"2161.485">__Point__</span> Yeah. They want you to be Herbie Hancock, right? <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b>Yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Two things. Yeah. And I'm, and yeah, right. Exactly. Yeah. There have been times when that <span style="color:red" data-ts="2170.325" data-end_ts="2170.485" title="2170.325" id=c_"2170.325">__has__</span>, when that has come up. But, but fortunately I didn't end up doing a lot of those kinds of sessions, but then when I was composing as a commercial composer, that's when you know how to make the right call and get the right player in there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and that's where you're talking before about if you find yourself in a position to have the budget to do it, why the hell wouldn't you? Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b>Yes. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Absolutely. That must've been amazing. So I, there's one other thing I wanted to ask about because you, you mentioned something, this is yet another one of these lines that resonates with me personally, because I experienced this, this, context switch. And you mentioned that you heard switched on Bach and that turned your head onto something, but it was hearing wild bull and silver apple that really lit you on fire, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b>Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And I think it's an interesting interplay because I think a lot of people from a synthesis standpoint, they heard switched on Bach, and for them it was like, synthesizers are great for doing emulative emulative kinds of sounds, and you could use it for these compositional purposes. Right. And maybe, yeah. And, and you know, that goes down one track and then there are a certain much smaller group of people that hear silver apples, and it's like that flexible fluid timing, those Yeah. Intricate other worldly tams. These are the things that speak to me far more than, you know, a a fugue ever could. Did you ever find yourself, I mean, that is such a big mental, mental jump, and I'm curious about, you would've found yourself in a position to sometimes kind of have to go back and sort of like say, well, yeah, but I really need to do I need to pull, I need to pull a Wendy Carlos outta my hat for this gig <laugh>, you know, instead of my, instead of my wild bull emulation. Right. Did you ever find yourself questioning that shift? Or was that such a part of your internal voice that, that always, that was always the obvious line for you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b>I think there's two things. One is like more, to me it sounds, those pieces sound so musical and so orchestral that it's not a very big jump, say from a revelle or scri <span style="color:red" data-ts="2327.625" data-end_ts="2327.845" title="2327.625" id=c_"2327.625">__and__</span> into silver apples and wild bull sonically, if you just Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know, close your eyes. I mean, you have these huge sweeps and stuff, say <span style="color:red" data-ts="2339.885" data-end_ts="2340.085" title="2339.885" id=c_"2339.885">__in__</span> levels that, are also there in a wild bull. I mean, these big tamal gestures. So musically that's all kind of in a, in a line to me that all goes from one, one to the next thing. Then the other thing is, is, going back to the, the Winnie Carlos stuff, what was so, exciting about Switch <span style="color:red" data-ts="2373.815" data-end_ts="2374.035" title="2373.815" id=c_"2373.815">__on__</span> Bach to me was not just the Tims, but the speed and, just this manic, <laugh> interpretation, which was the same thing that I loved about <span style="color:red" data-ts="2390.765" data-end_ts="2391.595" title="2390.765" id=c_"2390.765">__Glenn Gould__</span> was also here. It was on steroids with Wendy Carlos. So, they're all sort of part of the whole sonic timeline. Like they're, they're <span style="color:red" data-ts="2406.895" data-end_ts="2407.115" title="2406.895" id=c_"2406.895">__are__</span> musical things that, appeal to me every single time. And they are in those pieces, whether it's the speed, whether it's these big swoops and big, you know, these, these big crescendos, I mean, they just work. <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thanks for helping me out of that. I feel like I kind of talked myself in a weird corner, maybe <laugh>. So our time is, our time is getting close to done here. I can't believe it. But before I let you go, I do want to ask or talk a little bit about your current performance work. Again, one of the nice things, as you provided some, both, some audio and video excerpts, including a video of you and Peter working as the, what do you call it, the Zi Society? Is that 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b>It? Oh, yeah, yeah. Uhhuh 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative>. I wasn't sure how to pronounce that, because they had way too many Zs and not enough fouls. But, you know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b>I think Zis is actually correct. We've been calling it the Zizi Society, but, but as I've read more about Zis and what it, what it really is, I believe Isaacs is correct. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Wow. First of all, it's a, it's an interesting interplay that, that you have doing that because you, you know, it's two <span style="color:red" data-ts="2478.855" data-end_ts="2479.215" title="2478.855" id=c_"2478.855">__people__</span> deeply engrossed in their modular stuff, which I, I always tease people that, you know, talk about doing, duet or ensemble work with modular synth because, something a friend of mine once said was that, you know, a synthesizer can make all the sound, you know, you can fill up 100% of the frequency spectrum. And so having two people with that capability has the potential for being a train wreck. Right. When you're working with Peter, what, what do you do? How do you, how do you interact? How do you communicate in a way that makes for a useful and a musical performance? I I always love kind of pinging people on this because I think that, well, I'm just curious about how it's done, how, how you approach it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b>Well, you know, you've, you've asked a question that's really perfect, because this is, I, I mean, Peter might argue with me about this, but you're totally right. It definitely can be a train wreck. My personal way of looking at this is, is that Peter is more doing the freeform modular stuff and my <span style="color:red" data-ts="2549.205" data-end_ts="2549.485" title="2549.205" id=c_"2549.205">__stuff__</span>, and my side of it is much more structured and much more, based in the computer. And I see myself as providing a compositional structure and generally more rhythmic stuff, more things that, that have to do with form things that are gonna be consistent from performance to performance. And he's providing more analog, of course, with all of his modules that he's, that he's made and he's really good on his machine. So I feel like this, there's a rough division of labor that in my mind, helps to keep, keep that train wreck from happening. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Now, I noticed on one of the video pieces that you had that you actually had a, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2601.325" data-end_ts="2601.445" title="2601.325" id=c_"2601.325">__a__</span> harpist was working with you. How often do you, how often do you do work in where you're interfacing with like acoustic musicians? So I always think that the combination is really, is really wonderful, but it's also sometimes hard to get, especially like traditional musicians to, to down with somebody who looks like they're working a telephone, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2623.825" data-end_ts="2624.045" title="2623.825" id=c_"2623.825">__you__</span> know, an old style telephone console, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b><laugh>. Yeah. We have, one or two pieces that we feel like lend lend themselves very well to having another performer come in. And what is seems to be working at the moment is, is that we have somebody different come in for each performance. We've had Catherine Redless come in and play Harp the next time we did that same piece. Jennifer Irvine played cello on it. Peter's friend, Danny Carey's a drummer from Tool. He's, done some, some tracks on it for our record. We've got different people who come in, but it's not every piece in the program, it's just one or two pieces that we add somebody in. But I, I personally, going back to the commercials, I, to have somebody come in and play, and leave some space in the piece for 'em that is, is really, really, really good. I like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Yeah. Well, I think it's, it's an interesting, it's interesting that you say that. I think that some people have a desire to blast to the front of the stage. Right. But, yeah, my friend Andrew talks about, he's a, he's a really amazing jazz saxophone player, and he said that for, from his perspective, oftentimes the best groups that he played with were the people where everybody was very subtly trying to move to the back of the stage. Right. <laugh>. Oh, <laugh>. And there's something about that process Yeah. Where you're specifically opening up spots for other people lends itself to really great ensemble play. Right? Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b>Yeah. Well, and if you have somebody, like on a commercial, say you have a Paul Butterfield who come, who is willing to come in and play, you don't wanna tell him too much what to do. You want him to bring what he brings to the party, to your party. Right. Right. Exactly. So, so that's what I, what I hope to do when we do these performances. I hope to, to have people come in and, and bring something to the party and leave space for them to do that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So now that you're moving outta the commercial game and stuff like that, what, what are you working on now and what's, what are some of the future things that we can expect to secure from you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b>You know, I've always written music. I apparently am not gonna stop writing music <laugh>. So <laugh>, if it's just me out in the middle of the desert playing music for the coyotes, that's fine. There's just a whole bunch of stuff that I still, that I need to hear, so I'm gonna have to just write it and if there's an audience, fine. If there's not fine, every once in a while I have this, piece of property out in the desert out in Joshua Tree, and I've gone out there in the middle of the night with my laptop and my Bluetooth speakers and, and played stuff that I've written specifically for the desert out there in the middle of the night all by myself. And it's like one of the best musical experiences I've ever had. It's just like, it sounds great and I hope somebody else hears it, but yeah. I don't know if anybody's listening. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Boy, that sounds, that sounds like an amazing experience though. I, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2822.045" data-end_ts="2822.125" title="2822.045" id=c_"2822.045">__am__</span>. You know, I just kind of, that kinda like shot me to feeling that I can, I can totally imagine what, what that's like. I, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b>No, it's, it's like I, I've never ever stopped writing music my whole life. So at this age, I don't, you know, I don't have any illusions of, of creating a, having an au having, you know, growing an audience. But it's like if you have a bunch of flowers lying on the table, you don't just leave them there to <span style="color:red" data-ts="2850.785" data-end_ts="2851.005" title="2850.785" id=c_"2850.785">__wa__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2851.035" data-end_ts="2851.325" title="2851.035" id=c_"2851.035">__will__</span> till you, you pick 'em up and put 'em in a vase Right. And arrange 'em a little bit. And that's kind of like what music is like you, there's all this sound and you just gotta pick it up and put it in a vase and arrange it. And if somebody sees it, that's just great. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2865.765" data-end_ts="2866.005" title="2865.765" id=c_"2865.765">__Jill__</span>, I wanna thank you so much for, again, for the time. This was just a wonderful talk and, very inspiring. Oh, I appreciate it. Thank you so much. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b>Well thank you. Thank you for Thank you for having me. And, and this is you, you make it easy. Thanks. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, with that then I will let you have the rest of your day. Thank you so much. And have a good one. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jill: </b>Thank you. Alright, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nobody: </b><i>Bye bye. </i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, many thanks to Jill for spending the time talking. It's really great to get a chance to catch up with her, find out what all she's been doing, as well as what her background was. Pretty interesting stuff. Thank you so much for listening. Thanks for sticking with me. Next week is magic number 200. And so it's hard to believe that we've already gotten this far, but couldn't have done it without You'all. So thanks for showing up every week. I really appreciate it, that that'll let you.
