<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today I have a really special guest. I was turned on to her by my friend Tom Hall. We were at a retreat up in Northern California, and we got talking about different approaches and different practices around synthesis and synthesizers, and doing gigs and working with modulars. And he clued me in to this person. Her name is L Larsson. She goes by the artist's name here, that's H-E-A-R-E. And the more I looked into it, the more interested and intrigued and excited I was. And so Tom was able to get us connected pretty quickly, and I took advantage to immediately get her on the horn. So with that, I want say hi to <span style="color:red" data-ts="57.085" data-end_ts="57.285" title="57.085" id=c_"57.085">__El__</span> Larsson. Hi <span style="color:red" data-ts="57.925" data-end_ts="58.125" title="57.925" id=c_"57.925">__El__</span>, how are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>El Larson: </b>Hi. I'm great. Thank you so much for having me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, thank you so much for joining us. I know that you're busy, you're traveling right now, of course. But I appreciate you taking the opportunity to, to talk and, and do so. I mean, I was really excited about this because your kind of practice and your view of, of the art is atypical from what people generally think of as, you know, a musician's gigging life, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nobody: </b><i>Mm-Hmm. </i>
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b><affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So rather than me try and stumble through an explanation, why don't I have you give me a good explanation of what your, what your practice is. 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b>So I, I, I call myself a sound practitioner, and I use, sound as a healing and balancing modality for, individuals and groups. So I primarily, especially my private sessions with clients, I primarily use ancient Tibetan or technically ancient Himalayan singing bowls. They're commonly just called Tibetan singing bowls, but they're not all necessarily from Tibet. So they have a, they have a very strong, like vibratory and harmonic quality to them. They just sound amazing. So I primarily use those. And then with my group sessions, sometimes private sessions, I also throw in a modular synth, which is kind of a cool dichotomy, and it's a great instrument to, you know, use for that, for this purpose. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It is, and it's, it's quite a remarkable combination. I find. I mean, when I first saw that that was the combo that you were using, I was like, simultaneously thinking that's bizarre and <laugh>, and then simultaneously saying, but of course, I mean, the complimentary nature of the two sounds is just obvious as soon as you think about it. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b>Yeah, yeah. Just, just the richness and the depth of the bowls and, you know, again, the harmonics that come out of 'em. And, you know, especially if you're close to 'em with, with Himalayan bowls, they're the, they're the metal ones. They don't, you <span style="color:red" data-ts="181.885" data-end_ts="182.045" title="181.885" id=c_"181.885">__kind__</span> of need to be in a closer proximity to them. Like crystal bowls will really ring out through a room and they can fill a large space, Himalayan bulls. Being closer to them is, can be really special. And especially like when I work with clients individually, I place bowls on them as well as very close to them. So then you can really feel the vibration of the bowls and just, just the depth and the richness of sound coming out of them. And, you know, the harmonics is, is really amazing. Sure. I never thought that I would get so into the Himalayan bowls as I did <span style="color:red" data-ts="215.845" data-end_ts="216.165" title="215.845" id=c_"215.845">__until__</span> I started working with them. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's, that's cool Now. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> for people like me who are not necessarily steeped in the kind of practices you do, when you talk about working with groups or having clients or whatever, you're talking about sort of like physical therapy type sessions, right? Or like yoga sessions, or what is it? What would be something that like Darwin would understand? What would be a way to describe it that I would understand? Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b>So it's kind of like a sound, you know, in one way calling it a sound meditation is, is appropriate, but in another way it's kind of not appropriate because meditation is like, focusing on a certain point. So when I work with, and some people, when they do sound meditations, they really want the, the client to do something like, you know, deep listening or something where they're really focusing on the sound. When I work with a client, I just kind of want them to be able to go wherever they're supposed to go. If they fall asleep, they fall asleep. If they stay awake the whole time, they stay awake. If they do get fixated on the sound, then that's what happens. So in that sense, it's not really meditation, but you definitely do reach a meditative state, and it's a state where you go to, you know, theta brainwaves. 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b>And you, a lot of times you can dip into <span style="color:red" data-ts="297.615" data-end_ts="297.735" title="297.615" id=c_"297.615">__a__</span> subconscious realm, which is actually where, you know, the quote unquote healing can really happen when you start to let go of your conscious mind. And you can get into a state where you're able to let go of, you know, deep ingrained things, chronic pain, that sort of experience. So it's, let's say you were to come to a session of mine with a private session or even a group session. I always do, some sort of listening meditation or some sort of short, maybe five minutes type of meditation, sometimes even vocal toning where everybody is toning, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="332.495" data-end_ts="332.615" title="332.495" id=c_"332.495">__V__</span> tone. Okay. Different <span style="color:red" data-ts="334.135" data-end_ts="334.375" title="334.135" id=c_"334.135">__bowel__</span> tones. And then, so right. Then you're starting to use your voice and the resonance of your voice and starting to tune up your body or tune down your body. 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b>So once you kind of, you know, start to get into somewhat of a meditative state, and then in a private session and group session, most people end up laying down and it's basically a sonic experience. So again, private sessions differ from group because group, I'm playing to the group. I always like to incorporate an element of individual work with people. So that's another reason why I bring the modular along. I almost always start out, you know, acoustic with just playing the bowls in a group session. And then a lot of times, like I'll be playing some lower bowls, and then I'll very slowly bring in a drone, a deep drone, and then, once I have the synth going a little bit and then a drone running, then I'll go around and do some bulls work on people individually see, you know, place the bowl maybe on their chest or on their abdomen. So it's really about just, you know, the baseline thing is to help people release stress, which, you know, stress is one of the number one causes of illness, right. You know, today and, and doctor visits, and that's like the American Medical Association has said that, that this isn't just like, you know, hippie talk 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Sure. Well, I think that, there's something about, there's something about the kind of lives that, that we're living right now that tend to have a lot of stress without a lot of physical activity. And so there doesn't seem to be any mechanism by which to Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> release that a lot of times. And so mm-Hmm, <affirmative>, you know, the, the, the way that stress gets pent up in your body, I think can be really deleterious. Now, I'm curious then, so your use of the synthesizer then is almost like to set up a drone that can anchor the sound while you go around and do individuals in a group session. Is that kind of what you, you're doing Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> <span style="color:red" data-ts="449.485" data-end_ts="449.495" title="449.485" id=c_"449.485">__what__</span> you're doing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b>Interesting. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I, I, I al I almost always have a, a drone running, and then I tune the drone, I tune the oscillator of the drone, kind of what I feel the, the group needs, and maybe the time of day, you know, Indian raagas, you don't play a morning RA in the evening. So I might have, you know, depending upon what type of session is in time of day, I might do like an octave lower, an octave higher. And then also in, there's Tibetan system and then also the yoga system. There's different tunings for different energy centers of the body. So a lot of times I go to Tibetan system and maybe like the heart is tuned to an A. So, and I don't, you know, in my private clients, I don't always subscribe to that, but because I, I don't know, I don't really think that's necessarily a measurable thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b>That's basically, you know, monks and hermits living in caves have meditated for, you know, hundreds of years and we're like, Hey, my heart sounds like an A or my roots sounds like a C or something like that. So, you know, I'm not to that level where I, sometimes when I do hear a c I'm like, oh, wow, I really feel that hitting at a certain point, you know? But, I don't use that as my, you know, baseline all the time. But with a group session, a lot of times I'll say, okay, this is <span style="color:red" data-ts="520.525" data-end_ts="520.765" title="520.525" id=c_"520.525">__tuned__</span> to an A and that resonates with your heart and it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="522.605" data-end_ts="522.845" title="522.605" id=c_"522.605">__button__</span> system. Right. So that's, that's where the drone comes in. Yeah. And then I usually do like a very, kind of a very loose, randomized, disjointed melody, that, you know, it's like, it's kind of there, it's kind of not there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b>I use a module, a lot of times called a Turing machine. Yeah. And that generates, that generates random sequences, which is just fantastic. So then I'll, you know, have a pretty low BPM on that, so it's not going too fast, not going too slow. And again, it's random notes that might, and I usually put an LFO, to, to control the randomization. So maybe for a short period of time, you know, or, you know, 30 seconds or something. The, the, the, the, the melody is repeating and then it goes to a random space for a little bit of time, and then it goes to the repeating space. But it's a different, it's a re it's a different repeating pattern. So, it's not completely random, but it kind of weaves in and out of that. And then I, you know, depending upon how I think the session should feel, and also how the modular thinks the session should feel <laugh> all <laugh>, because sometimes it, it, it teaches me more than I'm like trying to control it. But, you know, I'll, tune the, you know, the, the quality of the sound and the tone of the sound and you know, how the feel of the sound. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So I'm really curious, one of the things I always like learning about people is how they make the choices that they do. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So first of all, mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, like, when you go out with the bowls, how many different bowls are you taking with you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b>I, I have 15 bowls. Oh my God. Ranging from, yeah. Yeah. Ranging from a couple of pretty big ones, and then, you know, several medium ones, and then several very small ones. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So a lot of times I just kind of bring 'em all. It's not like I have any more bags. They all kind of stack into each other. Oh, good. So, you know, sometimes I'll leave a couple of 'em out if I'm not doing individual work on people, maybe there's like three or four that I won't bring, but sometimes I don't always know what I'm walking into either. Right. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So, so you have these things, so that means that in really broad brush terms, there are sort of like 15 tones that you have as sort of like a starting palette, right? Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b><affirmative>. Exactly. <span style="color:red" data-ts="662.875" data-end_ts="663.165" title="662.875" id=c_"662.875">__Yeah__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>How do you, how do you make the choices to say, this is how I'm going to start, or This is what this room needs, or this is what this group of people, or this one person, or maybe this is what you yourself need. How do you, what, what does the choice matrix look like for you? What, what are you thinking or feeling at that time? 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b>So, ascending is typically uplifting. Descending is typically grounding. So if there's like some crazy, like, you know, people are kind of really airy and all over the place, I'll definitely start out with something grounding. If, if it needs a lightness, I'll start out with some higher tones. There's certain, combinations of bowls that I different, I do a lot of things in triads. You know, so playing three bowls together, playing repetitions of three, <span style="color:red" data-ts="713.275" data-end_ts="713.565" title="713.275" id=c_"713.275">__when__</span>, when I studied, I, a lot of what I learned was based off of sacred geometry. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Which is not necessarily the case because I don't have my bowls in a, I mean, I do have 'em in a specific layout, but it's, it's not based on geometric around a person. When I'm doing a group session, typically with a private session, I will start around their head, which is the higher bowl bowls, and that kind of clears out, and helps them to release some of their thinking minds and helps <span style="color:red" data-ts="739.755" data-end_ts="740.045" title="739.755" id=c_"739.755">__they__</span>, they start to get really tuned into the sound, and they're paying attention to the sound. And then they may or may not kind of slip into a subconscious state. So private clients, I almost always start with their head <span style="color:red" data-ts="751.095" data-end_ts="751.445" title="751.095" id=c_"751.095">__group__</span> sessions. I'm either gonna start high or low. Typically, I, I do start high if I feel that, well, these people really need to be grounded out right. Then I'll start low. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Interesting. It's 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b>Really simple, you know, it's, it's just kind of just basically that, do I wanna start high? Do I <span style="color:red" data-ts="765.885" data-end_ts="766.045" title="765.885" id=c_"765.885">__wanna__</span> start low? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now? What kind of environments are you doing this in? Are you doing this like in like a yoga studio or something like that? Do you go to, you know, the Howard Johnson's and rent out the, the space? <span style="color:red" data-ts="778.855" data-end_ts="779.205" title="778.855" id=c_"778.855">__Right__</span>. I, you know, where, where do these things happen? And to what extent does the room itself have like an impact on how you're going to create these things? Because it sounds like it's very improvisational within the context of the tools that you have. 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Right? Definitely. Definitely. Yeah. So especially in la, which is pretty much where I'm based. And they call 'em sound baths, like, like you're taking a bath and sound. Oh, okay. So yeah, sound baths have really gotten big the last few years, and they're popping up like several times a week. You know, I mean, you can find a sound bath pretty much any night of the week at yoga studios in la I do some of that. I, I'm interested in that. I'm also interested in really bringing it into the public space and kind of places where you wouldn't necessarily expect to experience something like this. Right. I've done some, yeah, I've done something at the Getty Center with a couple of other, I I brought in a couple of other practitioners. We did some bowls at the Getty Center, and then I've also done a few performance art pieces with an artist called Millie Brown. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thomas Thomas. Tell me about the work with <span style="color:red" data-ts="845.295" data-end_ts="845.645" title="845.295" id=c_"845.295">__Tamil__</span> Brown <laugh>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="846.545" data-end_ts="846.765" title="846.545" id=c_"846.545">__He__</span> explained the, yeah, the BMW car thing, which was kind of blew my head up. 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b>Right. Yeah. And then I just recently did another project with her at another, gallery where she was <span style="color:red" data-ts="856.485" data-end_ts="856.645" title="856.485" id=c_"856.485">__hang__</span> hanging from the ceiling with, from a harness with all these like, reflective crystals hanging down from her body then. And I was basically playing <span style="color:red" data-ts="865.075" data-end_ts="865.365" title="865.075" id=c_"865.075">__bull__</span> gong and bulls to her performance piece. So I really like doing installations, things like that, where it kind of gets it out of the yoga studio Sure. And in two places where people might not necessarily expect it and might not necessarily subscribe to it right away. Private sessions, I have a studio <span style="color:red" data-ts="883.945" data-end_ts="884.165" title="883.945" id=c_"883.945">__out__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="884.165" data-end_ts="884.285" title="884.165" id=c_"884.165">__of__</span> my, out <span style="color:red" data-ts="884.765" data-end_ts="884.845" title="884.765" id=c_"884.765">__of__</span> my home, and then I also will go see clients. I've also been hired to go to, you know, people's private homes and do small group sessions. Okay. So anywhere from, you know, six to, you know, 12 people at somebody's home. I've done that before. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now a lot of times I am kind of amazed by people I talk to because they have a combination of talents. It might be they're fantastic musicians and they happen to be really good computer programmers or Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, they're great, builders of hardware and they happen to, you know, have some other practice. You know, they're great visual artists also, your combination of talents and interests is really intriguing because, you know, I'm not, I'm not sure even how you get to the point, I was having a talk with another interviewee, and we were talking about the things about how difficult it is to say, I am an artist. Right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But I would think that it's, it's doubly hard to come to the point where you can say, I am a healer, or I can help with healing. I mean, that seems like an incredibly difficult self-judgment to have. 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And so I'm wondering first of all, how you, you know, what your background is that got you there, that got you to be able <span style="color:red" data-ts="966.345" data-end_ts="966.565" title="966.345" id=c_"966.345">__to__</span> say that? And what is your background that says, and the expression of this is the use of sound and, the use of sound in specifically in tune with the, the people I'm working with. 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b>So, first of all, I, I don't call myself a healer. Okay. I mean, I think that the work, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>A lot of people, and again, I'm sorry that I'm struggling for words because, you know, I'm not No, 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b>Listen. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b>It's a very, it's a very common, and, and, and I have absolutely no problem or judgment of people who do call themselves healers. Okay. Because that's, that is the, that is the standard term, you know, oh, you're a healer. Well, you're a healer <laugh>. So no, that's, that's a very common thing that people say, but like, okay. So I say it like I, if somebody comes into me and is very resistant to the process, I can't help them. Right. You know, it's basically the person laying down there that's actually doing the healing, because I can only do so much. I, that's what I call myself a practitioner, and I'm kind of more of a facilitator, and I try to set the space and create the stage because exactly what you, it's true exactly what you ask. Like for me to step into this thing just assuming, or hoping that I can help people. 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b>I mean, of course, that's my hope that I can help people and help them unwind and let go of things. And I hope they do have a healing experience. But that was, that was an intimidating factor for me when I decided to go down this route. I was like, oh my gosh. And there's all this pressure on me. And then I, as I was going through my course and kind of learning and understanding the process more, I felt much more comfortable with what my role within this space is. Sure. And I'm not, and, and what my responsibilities are, my responsibilities are for setting up the environment where the person can potentially heal. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, it's not my responsibility. If somebody with anger issues comes in and they leave feeling fantastic, and then they get in the car and they're swearing at every other car on the freeway, like, that's not, that's where my role stops, and that's where their responsibility comes in, is how are they gonna deal with what we've done in the last 60 minutes from here? 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b>So that's why, like, the person, my client is the healer, because they're gonna, you know, work with this or they're not gonna work with this. Sure. So that was one, that was actually one big thing that, you know, my teacher taught us in our course. She's like, you're not the healer, the, the person laying there. I, I studied with a woman named Dion Mandel, and she's actually certified by the state of California to teach and be a Tibetan bull practitioner. She specializes in that. Oh, okay. So studying with her was great. And then the other thing that I realized was when I realized the nuances of the bulls, it's my kind of, my job to mostly tune the bulls, because the bulls go in and outta tune based on the person. So that's a whole nother conversation. But the bulls sound different on different people. Can 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You explain that a little more? I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1141.005" data-end_ts="1141.045" title="1141.005" id=c_"1141.005">__am__</span>, I have trouble imagining how that could be, 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b>So, you know how a bowl or something will sound different against different surfaces. You know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1149.365" data-end_ts="1149.525" title="1149.365" id=c_"1149.365">__if__</span> something is setting, if, if a bowl is sitting on wood, it's gonna sound different, you know, sitting on carpeting. Right. It's gonna resonate differently. This kind of goes from science to woo <span style="color:red" data-ts="1158.085" data-end_ts="1158.285" title="1158.085" id=c_"1158.085">__woo__</span> and then back to science again, because some of it is definitely unexplainable. Something you can't explain because it's, it's energy and you're working, you at the end of the day, it is energy work. And then, you know, there is some physics involved because these things are vibrating surfaces and they're working against another vibrating surface, the human being. One of my most interesting experiences was, and this was like when I was still a student, I was doing a session on a friend, and I set a bowl on her abdomen, and I kind of had a feeling that, you know, maybe she had some blockages there, some energetic blocks or something. 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b>And then I sang the bowl one direction. So singing it is when you hold the mallet and you rub it against the rim, and it makes that the singing noise. Right. And it's saying, it's sang beautifully. I was like, oh, okay. So she sounds great. And then I sang it the other direction did not make a sound. I was like, whoa, that's kind of crazy. And that's one of the things that kind of also got me sucked into working with these instruments was like, they're, you know, pretty interesting and responsive. So, you know, I had it on her abdomen, which in, you know, yoga system, that's the third chakra. And that kind of represents like, you know, power, maybe stubbornness and confidence and things like that. So, after the session, and I asked her, I was like, so are, do you have any issues with stubbornness? 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b>And she was <span style="color:red" data-ts="1236.125" data-end_ts="1236.285" title="1236.125" id=c_"1236.125">__kinda__</span>, she kinda laughed at me, <laugh>, but you know, I, yeah, I might put a bowl on somebody's heart, and the bowl just sounds tired. It's not singing out all the frequencies. It's only sound, you know, sounding out the higher tones. It sounds scratchy, or maybe like I strike the bowl and the tone should, typically, the tone should typically ring out for 20, 25 seconds. Mm-Hmm. It might sound like it's getting sucked up after that. Mm-Hmm. So I listened, I listened to the sounds and the fluctuations of the sounds of the bottle on the person. And it doesn't tell me exactly what's going on, but I can kind of get a sense of what's going on. And it's more a question then that I ask the client afterwards, like, do you feel like you're not being supported in maybe a very general area of their life? 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, because to me, that's how the bowl sounds. The <span style="color:red" data-ts="1286.205" data-end_ts="1286.365" title="1286.205" id=c_"1286.205">__bowl__</span> sounds like it's not supported. There's no grounding aspect of the bowl. I'm only hearing like this very scratchy high end. So that really, that also drives a lot of what I do in my practice is how, how is the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1298.245" data-end_ts="1298.405" title="1298.245" id=c_"1298.245">__bowl__</span> sounding? So I'm working to tune the bowl. And then through the process of entrainment, theoretically that's also working to tune the person because, you know, entrainment is, you know, the synchronization of, you know, different, you know, things pulsating and vibrating at different, at different rates. Most things sync up. So, you know, kind <span style="color:red" data-ts="1315.845" data-end_ts="1315.925" title="1315.845" id=c_"1315.845">__of__</span> theoretically a person is, you know, let's say they've just gotten out of a really like messy divorce and their heart is just torn to shreds. Or I've had people, I'm like, it sounds like you got punched in the stomach <laugh>. Yeah. And they're like, that's exactly, that's exactly how it 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Feels. You what's 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1330.765" data-end_ts="1330.845" title="1330.765" id=c_"1330.765">__Felt__</span>. Yeah. And maybe, yeah, maybe their stomach is a knot. They're kind of, you know, holding a lot of energy there. And then the bowl is really reflecting that because it's sitting right on top of their stomach. Right. And, you know, I can be walking them through a visualization and literally hear the bowl open up with sound as they maybe start to breathe deeper or something like that. Interesting. So, yeah, it is pretty interesting. So that is another thing that I was like, oh, I can just work with the bulls and I can work with the sound. And this is, that also gave me some kind of reassured of, of doing this and being able to help people in this, in this, with this modality is just working with sound. You know, I'm not trying to solve all their problems. I'm trying to tune them and I'm trying to tune the bulls. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>No, I'm, I'm curious. It's, it's funny because you seem sometimes almost apologetic about, talking about the woo <span style="color:red" data-ts="1383.265" data-end_ts="1383.485" title="1383.265" id=c_"1383.265">__woo__</span>, you know, a little bit, but it's, at the same time, it's clear that you feel that there's a, there's power there that, that you Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> get to experience. What was your background in that? I mean, did you grow up around that kind of thing? Did you grow up in a very stifled environment? What is it that, what kind of environment were you growing up in that put that put you in a position to be able to kind of be accepting of this? 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1411.145" data-end_ts="1411.365" title="1411.145" id=c_"1411.145">__No__</span>, I started reading about Buddhism and Eastern philosophy <span style="color:red" data-ts="1414.675" data-end_ts="1414.965" title="1414.675" id=c_"1414.675">__than__</span> middle, middle. You know, I was definitely interested in that. And then I started, but then I was also very involved in music and just, you know, played piano when I was a kid, listened to a ton of music. And then I started playing records. I started DJing like in 99, so I was probably about 20 or something. Okay. I was like 19, I don't know, 19 or 20. So I, I didn't really actually start practicing yoga until about the same time, like 99 or 2000. But, you know, I was definitely interested in, in eastern thought, eastern philosophy. And then I, I, I moved around. I lived in London for a while when I left London, then I went to go, when I was living in London, that's when I really started practicing yoga pretty intensively. 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b>And I'd always wanted to practice yoga. Even when I was a kid, I didn't really know what it was. But, you know, I grew up way out in the country in Minnesota, and one of my friend's dad's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1467.285" data-end_ts="1467.365" title="1467.285" id=c_"1467.285">__was__</span> a hippie. And she was like, oh, I'm gonna go practice yoga with my dad. I can't play today. And I was like, oh, I wanna practice yoga. And I didn't really know what it was, but I knew that it was something that I wanted to do. Right. I didn't actually start practicing until I was, you know, like I said, maybe, I don't know, 99 or 2000. And then, and then I left London and I went to India for six months. And that was when kind of the two sound and yoga or, you know, something with energetics really collided. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. I went to these Buddhist caves and there's these, they're called RAs, and they're carved in the bottom of the mountain. 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b>So it's very resonant, very dense, very, you know, thick because it's all stone surrounding them. They're very small little dwelling places where traveling monks would study and meditate and chant and sleep, you know, they're, I don't know, whatever, like maybe six feet, five feet tall by six feet wide by four feet deep. So just these tiny little chambers. And had this little Indian guy with me, and he <span style="color:red" data-ts="1526.965" data-end_ts="1527.005" title="1526.965" id=c_"1526.965">__is__</span> like, just chant or say something. And I did. And my, I was just surrounded by thick resonance of my own voice. And it was really mind blowing for me. I was like, whoa, this is amazing. And that really, and I didn't know anything about sound healing or sound, you know, working with sound in that level before. And this was, I don't know, 2003 maybe. No, it was 2001. So that's kind of when I really got the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1556.745" data-end_ts="1556.965" title="1556.745" id=c_"1556.745">__bug__</span>. And I started reading everything that I could and studying everything that I could about sound as a therapeutic modality and the powers, you know, the beneficial properties of audio vibrations and just vibration in general. And then I studied yoga for a long time, and, and I never thought, you know, this is 15 years ago, so for me to just, oh, yeah, I wanna be a sound practitioner, was <laugh> didn't seem possible, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1579.405" data-end_ts="1579.565" title="1579.405" id=c_"1579.405">__but__</span> I still have a strong, like, practical aspect to myself. Right. My dad might not agree with me, but <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. But you did, you did come out of rural Minnesota, so you can only be too crazy. Right. <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b>By that time, I had moved to LA then, and I was practicing a ton of yoga. I was practicing Tonga, my <span style="color:red" data-ts="1597.205" data-end_ts="1597.405" title="1597.205" id=c_"1597.205">__first__</span> style, which is a self practice, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1598.725" data-end_ts="1598.845" title="1598.725" id=c_"1598.725">__and__</span> you practice six days a week, and you practice the same damn thing every day for the most part. And it's a very, it's a very grueling, yet very amazing practice. And I also started assisting, the teacher, and then I was giving a lot of hands-on adjustments. So for several hours a week I was doing hands-on adjustments on people. And that's when I started really feeling frequencies in other people's bodies and feeling them in myself and like hearing them. And I would kind of base my adjustments based on like, if I felt like I was hitting the spot or not. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know, I'm, it'd be interesting to like, hear something and then slightly shift my finger and then here's something else, and then maybe feel like, no, I need to move it a little bit more. And then all of a sudden they would like let out a sigh or like something would release it, you know? So that's kind of, you know, my first experience of working with people and sound on that level, which is another reason why I thought the modular would be really awesome to use, because you can, any frequency you want, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1660.015" data-end_ts="1660.365" title="1660.015" id=c_"1660.015">__right__</span>. Take your pick. It's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You're, you're not, you're not limited to the Yeah. You're not limited to the slots where the keys are located. 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b>Exactly. Exactly. You can just very fine tune things and, and slightly <span style="color:red" data-ts="1671.335" data-end_ts="1671.685" title="1671.335" id=c_"1671.335">__shift__</span> it from one frequency to the next, basically. I was like hearing feeling frequency. So, so that's, I was like, okay, there's something to this. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And now the use of the modular, so the, the bulls there, it sounds like there's a very specific practice behind the use of the bulls, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, your introduction of the modular into that was, you know, is obviously your own personal tweak on that. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Why, other than the ability to select any note, is there any other reason? I mean, is there something about the analog nature of it? Is there something about the use of wires and, atypical connections? Is there something about it that, that feels or seems or reacts more organically than other systems? <span style="color:red" data-ts="1721.185" data-end_ts="1721.405" title="1721.185" id=c_"1721.185">__Why__</span>, why the modular? 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b>So, you know, I started, I played, I dj techno for <span style="color:red" data-ts="1726.385" data-end_ts="1726.605" title="1726.385" id=c_"1726.385">__me__</span> for several years. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I, during that time, I had tried and failed many times to like, make my own music. And I always wanted to make my own music, make my own electronic music. And, you know, I've, I'm, I'm relatively tech savvy, but I also in some areas have a very low level of patience. So, you know, trouble <laugh> troubleshooting things. I just like try something else a little bit or it just wasn't working for me. Like, you know, just solely working on a computer. Didn't really vibe with that. And then my husband is a very, he's basically a sin whore, <laugh>, <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I know them all. 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b>Yeah. Right. So, and he's a proper composer, so he's an actual, like musician. I don't consider myself a musician really, to be honest. And he started working, he started working with a modular like several years ago. And then, you know, and I would just hear him talk about all the modules. I was like, oh, cool, this is really neat. So, I finally started using it like just about a year ago, actually really diving into it. Like we would sit down in front of his rig many times and, you know, kind of play with patches a little bit together. And when I really started diving into this, and, you know, feeling that I wanted to add something else to it, so my whole intention to working was <span style="color:red" data-ts="1803.045" data-end_ts="1803.365" title="1803.045" id=c_"1803.045">__found__</span>, even when I did this Tibetan Bull course, was that I, at the end of the day, I wanted to do something with electronics because I have pretty good resources behind me. You know, my husband who's been, you know, doing maxims p for 15 years and then, you know, modular and he can like, Hey, how do you do this? So I've got like, you know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. He gets, gets good help <laugh>. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b>So that's the honest answer. Sure. But definitely the actual playing of the instrument, it's, it's kind of like the perfect fit for me apart from the whole learning curve situation, which, like I said, I've got, I've got a live-in synth guru. Right. Which covers that hurdle for me. The whole method of playing it, you know, touching knobs, working with mostly analog gear, being able to have infinite options in front of you where, oh, let me see what happens when I plug this into this is really one of my favorite methods of creation. And also the fact that it kind of like, in a way it plays itself and one, one of our, one of Tom and I, our friends Colin, Colin said <span style="color:red" data-ts="1866.945" data-end_ts="1867.165" title="1866.945" id=c_"1866.945">__the__</span> synth kind of plays you more than you play it. Right, right. So, you know, from that side of things as well, it's a, it's a really, it helps to teach me patience, it helps to teach me flexibility. And a lot of times, like, I'm like, alright, so let's see what it, what it wants to do today from physical, working with it, you know, having things to plug in and to turn and to manipulate to, you know, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1891.525" data-end_ts="1891.805" title="1891.525" id=c_"1891.525">__sounds__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1891.955" data-end_ts="1892.245" title="1891.955" id=c_"1891.955">__that__</span> makes, and to being able to work with, you know, analog gear and for it to be infinitely expandable, you know, and I can change out my case as much or as little as I want. You know, I can throw in one different module or something and it can sound completely different. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. It's very interesting. Did I 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b>Answer the question or did it just go off on a tangent? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I, I'm not even sure what the question was anymore, <laugh>, but I don't care because that was a really interesting direction to go with it now. A couple of, a couple of details just again, I am, I'm really interested because, so like for myself, when I go do a performance, I've, I've come to have what I would call my own practice about getting ready to do a gig, because if I just come rushing in with my cases, 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Flip everything open and start squirting out noises. It's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1941.925" data-end_ts="1942.045" title="1941.925" id=c_"1941.925">__going__</span> to be terrible. I'm gonna hate it. The whole thing's gonna be a mess. Right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And so there's sort of like this little thing I go through where I set stuff up and then I let myself be frustrated with whatever's wrong, and then I get it going, and then I walk away and I come back and I sit down and I try and make just a pure sine wave to just kind of, you know, be able to focus my mind and then I'll walk away and then I'll come back and do something else. You know, I've got this little, this little pattern that I go through so that by the time it's, I'm ready to play, I'm sort of in a good mindful place to do it. Right. Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b><affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> that's for me making squeaky noises at a coffee shop. What is the practice that you must go through in order to be able to, I mean, because again, when what I'm gathering is that an awful lot of what you do is sort of like being very, very mindful to the, the needs and to the physicality of your clients, of the people that you're working with and being very responsive to whatever their subtly telling you. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> what, what is the process you have to go from the time you're schlepping in your bowls and your gear to be able to, to mentally and, you know, spiritually handle something like that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b>When I do private sessions, it's kind of nice because like I said, I've got a studio out of my home. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So I usually set up, you know, well before they come. And then, you know, I'm already in my space. So that's, I usually do, you know, some meditation. I always do some meditation before they come. And then while they're doing their meditation, while I'm walking them through their meditation, I also, you know, I'm kind of clearing myself as well. And then when I'm doing a group session, yeah, it is definitely schlepping and setting stuff up. And, and that's kind of when I start to, 'cause I always set up everything on the floor. And I work from the floor, and so I squat a lot just, and that's very grounding. It's a very grounding posture. So a lot of times, like as I'm setting up, like, and I start playing my bowls right away because you kind of wanna play, have bowls. 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b>The bowls ring for a little bit. They really sound best after they've been warmed up a little bit. It's like a gong. Okay. So as I'm setting my bowls up, I'll start striking up and just immediately the tones of the bowls, you know, it really helps to shift and relax me. But definitely the squatting position and just doing some deeper breathing, I, I immediately start slowing down my breath, taking some deeper breaths, just kind of listening to the space too, listening to like, what are some sounds outside, like are there any hums? And sometimes hums are great, like sometimes like the, the noise of the traffic kind of distant traffic on the street, it kind of sounds like water. And sometimes I'll inc incorporate things like that into the meditation that I do with people. So, you know, that's, that's my process of just, you know, starting to slow myself down. 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b>Another really big part of it is to just clear yourself and not assume an outcome and not have expectations of how it's gonna go or how people are gonna feel, or really what's gonna happen. You know, I come with my rig fully patched. I don't, I don't patch on the spot. So, so sometimes it is like, okay, what is this gonna sound like now when I turn it on? You know? And I, I bring a little tuner to make sure that everything is tuned together. Yeah. So, like I said, a big part of it is just kind of like clearing it and being, being more of a channel than being a performer. It's really not about being a performer at all. It's more about like, you know, letting go of whatever my frustration with traffic was half an hour ago. And, you know, the fact that I was, you know, bringing all this stuff in, maybe the place wasn't unlocked and maybe it was still sweaty from the class before or whatever. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, but that's, that's exactly what I was asking because it seems to me like, yeah, I, I get that you're not a performer, but at the same time the frustration of traffic still has to wear on you. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And especially if Totally Yeah. If you are, if sort of like, the job of the moment is to be very aware of the people that you're interacting with. Yeah. Yeah. Especially in the, the way that la traffic seems to affect LA people. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I would think that it would be, I would think that it would, that there has to be a strong practice for yourself to be able to prepare for this. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b>I also kind of have the personality where I'm like, oh, sometimes I can, I can get shaken up. I'm not saying that I don't uhhuh <affirmative>, but I can also kind of brush it off easily. And it's like the bulls man, you know, if i's all about the bulls, if I start playing the bulls, they can almost immediately help to shift me to a state of being more calm. That makes, you know, and a lot of times 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>No, that makes a lot of sense. I've had the, yeah, I've had the opportunity to be around, around the bulls in action. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and they're wickedly effective at Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> kind of like capturing your subconscious attention, you know, even if they're not, even if you're not actively listening to the sound, it almost seems like they draw in your subconscious into, into paying attention into alignment. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b>Exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And so I, I can imagine that that squatting down and ringing that first bowl just like starts washing away everything. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> that led up to it. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b>Perfectly. You know, and if I notice if, if I'm on the way down to, a, a, a show or an event or something and I'm starting to get elevated, I'll try to catch myself before I get too frustrated <span style="color:red" data-ts="2287.525" data-end_ts="2287.845" title="2287.525" id=c_"2287.525">__Gotcha__</span>. Turn off the radio or else I'll put on, I'll put on something that I wanna be hearing, or maybe I'll even do some vocal toning. I'll like, you know, if you're frustrated, what do you wanna do? You wanna yell, so why not release that energy and let go of it? Or maybe I'll like, you know, I need to do some grounding, so I might, you know, I might do some vocal work on myself as I'm driving down there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. Right? Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b>Yeah. So I try to catch it before it gets, and, you know, at the end of the day, if you're 10 minutes late, it's not a problem. It's, it's, it's fine if people get really frustrated that you're a few minutes late or that things are running 10, 15 minutes late, you know what, that's what they need to work with Right. Then <laugh>. Right, right. It's, it's okay. It's okay. So, you know, I I try to catch myself before I get too much wound up and frustrated because I def that can definitely happen. And I try to like, oh yeah, I have these tools that I tell people about all the time, so maybe I should start doing one <span style="color:red" data-ts="2342.045" data-end_ts="2342.165" title="2342.045" id=c_"2342.045">__of__</span> them myself. Right. And, you know, then it usually prevents me from like, walking in there a mess. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> <laugh>. That's amazing. All right, well, this is, this is amazing and, and I'm getting now more of a sense of what, what your practice and what your activities look like. Now, my assumption is that more, more often than not, or maybe equally often, or maybe seldom, but I suspect relatively often you run into skepticism. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> you run into people who are like, you know, you're selling a bill of goods or I don't see how that could possibly work or whatever. I don't even know what, what, you know, what the exact form of it would be. But I would imagine that, I would imagine you run into a fair bit of skepticism. 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b>You know, I don't frequently like people coming in for private sessions, I usually, you know, I've never had anybody whose spouse or you know, significant other has like <span style="color:red" data-ts="2402.835" data-end_ts="2403.125" title="2402.835" id=c_"2402.835">__more__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2403.125" data-end_ts="2403.405" title="2403.125" id=c_"2403.125">__door__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Stomping in door. 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b>Yeah, exactly. But I've definitely had people like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2406.725" data-end_ts="2407.005" title="2406.725" id=c_"2406.725">__come__</span>, this is really interesting. What is it? You know, but in conversation that's more of, you know, something I'll get more of in conversation. Right. So then I just ask them like, do you connect with music? Are there certain sounds that bother you? How do you feel when you hear birds singing versus nails on a chalkboard? Right. Like, there's clearly different emotional reactions to those two different sounds, and it's like, okay, so clearly the aesthetic properties of sound can have an effect on you. And then do you listen to something different on your commute to work versus on your commute home? Or do you listen to something different when you like, are feeling low energy and want to get ready to go out, or that you feel like you need to wind down? So people use sound and music as a therapeutic modality in their own lives without even thinking about it 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>All the time. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b>All the time. All the time. And it's so intuitive. I mean, that's kinda my answer to skeptics. And then if they wanna get and talk about physics as, wow, we can talk about physics, we can talk about the physics of audio vibrations. Like, I mean, ultrasound is kind of one of those gray areas because ultrasound, you know, using it for, you know, in, physical therapy and things like that, it works, but you don't really know how it works. But, you know, there, there are a lot of measurable things happening in science with applications of sound that are really, really cool. And what about resident frequency? Right. So there's definitely a lot of, a lot of examples that you can offer people who, who are skeptical of this. And the first thing is something that I like to offer them that they really might understand is how do you use music? Like when you, you know, to change your emotions? You, you know, I'm sure there's very few people who don't connect with music and who don't like music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. You know, the thing is, I think an awful lot of people assume that the effect of music is psychological, you know, that it's Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, upbeat music makes me feel upbeat. Dirge music makes me feel sad, as does emo rock or whatever. Right. But I think that I, I think that's an overly simplistic view because I mean, unless, unless everything we're learning is wrong, psychology is just a different, a different set of chemicals that happens to be flowing through our system at any given time. So it seems like right's, physical manifestations of these, of these psychological things and, you know, so it seems like the physics, there being some physics behind that isn't completely unimaginable. 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b>Right. And also, you know, think about it. So if you're listening to an upbeat song, check your heartbeat. What's your, what's your pulse rate? Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Is it match? So if you're 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b>Listening to, yeah. So if you're, if you're listening to, you know, if you're listening to drum and bass and you're, you're really engaging with the drum and bass, check your pulse, right? If you're listening to some really slow classical music and you've relaxed to that classical music, check your pulse. So, you know, that's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2584.045" data-end_ts="2584.165" title="2584.045" id=c_"2584.045">__a__</span>, that's a prime example of your body and check your breath rate. That's a prime example of the body responding. And in <span style="color:red" data-ts="2589.365" data-end_ts="2589.565" title="2589.365" id=c_"2589.365">__train__</span>, in training, this is entrainment in training to, you know, different types of music. So, you know, when the physics of it comes in, I mean, Caltech is doing something really cool where they're using sound to stimulate different areas of the brain. So sound can be used as a form of non-invasive brain surgery. Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b>So I can send a skeptic to Caltech website. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>There you go. 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b>That's, that's another point <span style="color:red" data-ts="2617.925" data-end_ts="2618.045" title="2617.925" id=c_"2617.925">__that__</span> I'm really interested too, like this, the Western science and western medicine. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2623.205" data-end_ts="2623.325" title="2623.205" id=c_"2623.205">__I__</span>, I want to thank you so much for taking the time to, to talk. This has been fascinating. I feel like I've learned a lot, but I also feel like I've just scratched the surface into some things that I wanna, I want to do a little more research into because, you've opened some interesting, interesting conceptual doors for me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b>Oh, fantastic. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I have to do some looking around to see if I can find a sound bath. 'cause just the very name of it is very intriguing to me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b><laugh>. Yeah. I'll see who's doing it around there. And I'll definitely see you in Minnesota sometime. Oh yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You, you have to swing by. We'll, yeah, go get a pop 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b><laugh>, a soda pop. <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Soda pop. That's right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b>Definitely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>All right. So thank you so much and have a great evening. 
</p>

<p>
<b>El: </b>Thank you. You too. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2667.275" data-end_ts="2667.765" title="2667.275" id=c_"2667.275">__Alright__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nobody: </b><i>Bye. </i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Hi all. I'm hiding up in Portland this weekend, but I took the opportunity to pull this one together. I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did. It was really interesting to hear a completely different perspective on the world of sound. So, enjoy. Thank you so much for continuing to listen, for continuing to hang on, and I hope to see you next week. Thanks. Bye.
