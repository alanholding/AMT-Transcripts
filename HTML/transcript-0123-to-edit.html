<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. This week we are going to be talking again to somebody who we did early in the, the podcast series. His name's Andrew Benson He's, a coworker of mine at Cycling 74, but he is really becoming quite well known as a visualist visual artist and graphic artist. He does a wide range of work from some bizaro unicorny stuff to live video production to, py gifs. And every time I see his work, it's, first of all, it's cool because it's identifiable. Secondly, it's cool because I'm like, Hey, I know that dude. It's pretty neat. So, with that, I'm gonna say hi again to Andrew Benson Hi, Andrew. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew Benson: </b>Good. How's it going, Darwin? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's going great. Thanks a lot for, coming back for a repeat visit since we got your background the first time around. This time we're gonna talk a little bit more about some of the, some of the practicalities of being a professional artist and particularly a visual artist. And so I hope you're willing to go for a little ride with me on this. Sure. So, first of all, why don't we start off by talking about, some recent work that you've done. What are some of the, what are some more, more notable things that you've done recently? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Well, there's a couple things. The, the most, sort of, the biggest thing I did was I had this kind of big, like, corporate event, job, as sort of like the giant pre-up bowl, parties and stuff like that. And so that involved, there was like a DJ show, and there was this like specially made venue in San Francisco out in the dog patch. They had completely converted like this, old shipyard building, into a music venue. And so I was responsible for doing some audio responsive visuals, for a special kind of VIP event that was happening there as part of those celebrations. And that was a really cool job because, it, I was working through an agency and so it's, it's sort of rare that I get to really collaborate with a whole group of people and work with a creative director and other artists and animators and stuff like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>And so the really great part of that job was sort of the, the interplay between sort of taking the, the stills and motion tests and animations that the creative director and the art directors were coming up with and converting that into something that could happen in real time. And, so like the process there was really kind of cool. 'cause like they would send me like a cinema four D file, and I would sort of like dig in there and be like, okay, well that's a, that's a cloner and that's <span style="color:red" data-ts="184.445" data-end_ts="184.605" title="184.445" id=c_"184.445">__in__</span> like a, a modifier on that cloner. And so I can take that and do this equation and, you know, take it into max MSP and like jitter and do, you know, do like, sort of replicate those expressions and the way that things are moving around and stuff like that. It's a really fun process and it came off really well. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Did you, did you limit yourself to working with, with Max or did you use other tools also? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>I'm trying to think. I, I think like once I heard the specs on the job and the timeline and, what <span style="color:red" data-ts="218.445" data-end_ts="218.725" title="218.445" id=c_"218.445">__want__</span>, what they wanted to do and the way that they wanted to work on it, max was sort of the obvious choice. Okay. Because for one thing, I wasn't, I wasn't working with another developer that had some pre-existing tool that they were trying to push. Right. You know? Sure. So it was like, so I, I had completely free reign to kind of choose how I wanted to work and kind of knowing what they wanted to do and how they wanted the audio to res to be really, like, they really wanted to create a connection between the audio and the graphics. And for me, like, I mean, for one thing, max is just sort of like part of my brain at this point. Sure. And so I know that I can execute something really quickly in Max if, if nobody else is depending on like, sort of being able to like write c plus plus code alongside me or something, then, then Max is the obvious choice there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That makes sense. Now, my one question I would have is, well, I've got a lot of questions just about this kind of gig because it's something I've never done. I've never done the large corporate gig thing. First of all, what is like the scale that we're talking about? So you had <span style="color:red" data-ts="285.765" data-end_ts="285.925" title="285.765" id=c_"285.765">__the__</span>, you had a screen, how big was the screen? It's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>About the size of my living room wall. Mm-Hmm. Is like one of the screens <laugh>. Okay. And like, so there was, there was like a lower kind of big LED wall, and then above like, sort of behind the DJ booth there was a projection as well. Oh, I see. What you're, <span style="color:red" data-ts="303.285" data-end_ts="303.405" title="303.285" id=c_"303.285">__sure__</span>. So it was actually, it was sort of two screens and there were sort of, there was a top screen and a bottom screen. Right. And as people walked in the door of this venue space, it's sort of like a, it was like a lounge kind of environment. And so as they walk into the door, they see like they're faced to the LED screen and, you know, it's, it's not like a giant, it wasn't like the room that I was in was sort of the VIP lounge, so it wasn't like 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Giant. <span style="color:red" data-ts="327.485" data-end_ts="327.685" title="327.485" id=c_"327.485">__Oh__</span>, okay. I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Get it. It wasn't like, there was like a whole giant multi-level music venue, like next door to that. But, the space that I was in was a little bit more intimate. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, so you were, you were in the liquified shrimp room. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Yeah. <laugh>, exactly. Nice. Yeah, there was, there was some good appetizers, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I bet. That's hilarious. So I'm curious then, first of all, why would someone hire you for a gig like that? And secondly, what do you do to make it so that you're clearly not doing sort of the regurgitated DJ VJ kind of a thing? You know, I assume that you get the job because you're not gonna be standard issue. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Yeah. I think that, in this case, I was the only person in their professional network <laugh>, that could pull the job off, pull 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Off real time stuff. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Okay. You know, and yeah. In the way that they wanted to do it. Got it. They, you know, they, I, I talked to them about it and they were really happy with the fact that I was, coming from a visual background, but was sort of competent about, programming and stuff like that. And that, I feel like that made a lot of the communication, like, I mean, to me, like, I think if I could highlight anything from, like, what made that job work was like, like having really good back and forth communication with the creative team is like, you know, them being able to share what they want and what they're interested and then me being able to say, oh, I get what you're saying there, and then take it and, and run with it. And then also sending them ongoing updates, to the software itself so that they could see it as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So what kind of different stuff did you get from them? I mean, so you talked already about getting a cinema four D scene Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, which has a lot of its own peculiar internal methods for doing things. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And you have to be knowledgeable about that in order to talk sensibly to them. What other technologies or systems were they using that you had to be, you had to kind of understand? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Well, some of it was, I mean, luckily this is like a production agency that is, I mean, they do work with Unity and they do, so they, they were pretty good about like sort of being able to translate whatever they were working on into stuff that I could use. Okay. But, some of it was just Photoshop compositions that one of the creative directors made to kind of give to the client. And so, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="480.025" data-end_ts="480.185" title="480.025" id=c_"480.025">__in__</span>, in, in agency work, there's this whole back and forth process where you have, you have the creative directors who are putting together like these kind of mood boards. And as it gets further along, they become more and more narrow. And there's like, you know, this is, these are still frames that we've shown the client, the client has approved them. Okay. And so we have to stay kind of close to this look, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Right. And so that was kind of the, like the overall guiding force. Sure. Were these kind of style frames. And then I was getting motion samples. So a lot of the, a lot of the work was just going on inside of After Effects. They were making <span style="color:red" data-ts="515.265" data-end_ts="515.385" title="515.265" id=c_"515.265">__a__</span> little kind of graphic animations. So the, the pro the project overall had kind of three different looks to it, one of which was very sort of 3D cinema, four D, lots of like replicated mesh shapes and stuff like that. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And then the other two sort of main looks were very sort of flat, 2D vector graphics, kind of like, you know, little balls jumping around and Got it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="539.625" data-end_ts="540.045" title="539.625" id=c_"539.625">__Swirly__</span> things and stuff like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Very interesting. How did you get, working with them? Because I know you do other work and you have some sort of like agency that you work with on that are, are they like connected in some way or two completely different practices? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>So in, in this particular case, I was contacted by a former student of mine, actually. Oh, okay. <laugh>. Oh, interesting. <span style="color:red" data-ts="566.025" data-end_ts="566.245" title="566.025" id=c_"566.025">__So__</span>, yeah, he was, I, I had actually forgotten that he had ever taken my class. I knew he was at SFAI when I was teaching. Okay. And I was like, did you, did you really? Were you one of my students? And he was like, he, he was there when I was like teaching my first year, . Doing the interactive media classes. Right. And so over the years, he's sort of, gotten really good at being a, like a programmer. Like he's a really smart programmer, and so he's been able to kind of get in these positions. His name's Ian Bartholomew, and, he's now, I think he's back at Huge. Which is kind of one of those really big ad production agencies. They do a lot of tech work. Right. But, so he brought me on to the project because they were, they were kind of thinking about different concepts and, you know, he was like, he was like, this is like, I know the guy. We can do this. You know? Sure. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, this all took place in San Francisco, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Yeah. The actual event happened in San Francisco. All the prep work, was done in Los Angeles. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, okay. Yeah. And I was, 'cause I was gonna say since the last time we talked, you made a pretty big life move, which was moving from San Francisco to la. Why, why did you make the move? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Well, there was a lot of reasons. I think the most, sort of present reason in our minds was, that we lived in a junior one bedroom apartment. And first we were doing that with one kid. And then we, then my second daughter was born, <laugh>. Okay. And, you know, I mean, we were already, when we moved into that apartment, we were like, we're gonna have to scale up at some point, you know? Right, right. And that was sort of five years ago that we had moved in there. And, you know, our older daughter just kept getting bigger <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>They do that. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>And the younger daughter came along. And then, so like, the idea of all everyone living in the same bedroom, it was just like becoming like more and more ridiculous as time went by. And shortly after we had moved into that apartment was when sort of rent prices in San Francisco started kind of just tripling and quadrupling and, and all that. So it was like we were kind of stuck in a situation that we couldn't necessarily, like we couldn't scale up, but we could afford to keep doing the same thing if we were able to. Right. So there was that like, sort of not having a, a place, not having a place in San Francisco to go other than where we were living. But then also I had reached a point where, I mean, I was living in San Francisco in Bernal Heights, which is New York Times did some piece about it being like the hottest real estate market in America, sort of like, within the time that I was living there, it had become sort of a massive explosion. So, but I had, I had reached this point where everyone I talked to pretty much every day had like some sad story to tell about what's happening in San Francisco, you know, and it was like this real feeling in the art community there of like, everything is falling apart. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I've heard that from so many people. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Like, we're losing, like, you know, who did we lose this week? Who got evicted? What art space has to shut down? You know? And there's, there's a few organizations that are there, and they're really fighting the good fight. And I mean, like, Southern exposure is still in the mission. And, there's some really great stuff still happening. And I keep hearing, you know, there's this whole kind of Minnesota Street project that, just went up. So I, I mean, there's people there who are really kind of fighting the good fight, but I also realized that I'm not capable of fighting that fight on the level that like, you know, that that sort of like, the longer I stayed there, the more responsible I started feeling for the city and how things were going. And, you know, I just kind of reached a point where it was like, I have my, I have my family, I have, you know, the art I'm trying to make, I have, everything else. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>And, you know, it ultimately I just had to cut and run to a certain extent. Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="804.065" data-end_ts="804.285" title="804.065" id=c_"804.065">__Yep__</span>. Agree. But also, I mean, the other side of that is LA is a great place. Like, it's <laugh>, it's, it's really easy to kind of get in, get caught up in this victim narrative of like, sort of like, I'm this exile from San Francisco <laugh>, I've been like, I've been ejected from my home. Right. You know, but ultimately, like, we really want, like, we had wanted to move to LA for a, a good like five or six years before we actually made the jump. Oh, okay. It was sort of a matter of time, both between my wife's professional, ambitions and my own, just like LA was really way better of a place for that better 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Fit. I'm contemplating a move shortly. I'm gonna be moving from the Boulder Denver area. I'm gonna be moving to, to near Minne Minneapolis. Obviously kind of different, different levels of city there, but still similar in concept, which is I've built sort of an art community here, and now I'm <span style="color:red" data-ts="861.645" data-end_ts="861.845" title="861.645" id=c_"861.645">__gonna__</span> sort of like, skip out of town and go to a new one. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And you've just done that. And so now I need some advice from you, <laugh>. How do you make that kind of transition? How much do you stay connected to the old group? How do you develop a new group? And, what are some of the tricks to making a transition like that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>It is, it's really hard to make the transition. I mean, even even San Francisco to la, I mean, they're very close and there's a lot of interchange between San Francisco and Los Angeles. <span style="color:red" data-ts="895.105" data-end_ts="895.325" title="895.105" id=c_"895.105">__It__</span> like, sort of artistically and socially. But I would say like the, the, the thing that really hurt probably the most of switching cities is this feeling of like, going from like, I had lived in San Francisco for 12 years. I went to school there, I was teaching there, for six years. And, you know, sort of maintaining this very like, kind <span style="color:red" data-ts="917.485" data-end_ts="917.565" title="917.485" id=c_"917.485">__of__</span>, you know, like sort of low pri, low profile life. But, you know, doing like, sort of doing the best I could with that. Within that system, you, you build up this kind of great network of friends and people that you bump into all the time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>And, you know, it's like all, all that little stuff like, oh, I need to do this thing. I know who to call. Right. To make that happen, you know? And, and so making the transition from having this kind of like, really deep local network to going somewhere where it's like, yeah, I, like, I know some people in LA and I, you know, every, every day I feel a little bit more settled socially here. But, there was definitely some, some adjustment period to sort of going from like, you know, the elder statesmen of the art scene in San Francisco to being like sort of the new guy in town in la. Right. You know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So like, one of the things that I'm really scared about is, is that here around Denver, I've, I've gotten the opportunity and, and recently especially, we've gotten more opportunities to do things like, you know, work with the Denver Art Museum, which is a class a art museum. You know, working with them on installations and projects and design and stuff like that. It <span style="color:red" data-ts="991.445" data-end_ts="991.485" title="991.445" id=c_"991.445">__was__</span> really fantastic. And it's really hard to imagine walking away from the interesting opportunities that that holds. You know, I mean, there's just literally just changing venues. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> means that there's gonna be a lot of lost opportunity, or at least it seems like it. Do you try to keep up with anything back in San Francisco? Do you try to maintain any gigs there? Or did you have to just walk away? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>I, I mean, I try to keep up socially, but it's, it's hard. I mean, it's, I, the way I would sort of compare it is like if you, you know, when, when you work at like a coffee shop or something and you like have your work buddies, you know, and then you like go and you, like, you quit that job and you move to another coffee shop, and you all of a sudden, like you're those old work buddies, like, you don't really call 'em anymore, you know? Right, right. And I feel really bad about it, of course. But I, yeah, I, I don't do as good of a job of keeping up with like, sort of current events in San Francisco as I probably could. But, I do. I go, I've been going up there a couple times a year, 'cause we have some good friends and my, you know, I have an 8-year-old daughter who has like best friends back in the Bay Area still. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1068.465" data-end_ts="1068.685" title="1068.465" id=c_"1068.465">__We__</span> have to, to meet, you know, meet up with and hang out with. And we are of course, good friends with their parents too, so. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>So it's, I guess the, the weird thing about it is that I, I feel like I'm keeping up a lot with people in San Francisco, but it's not really like art. The, like my art friends, I'm, I've been less good at keeping up with, you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Know, <laugh>. So mostly your, mostly your parenting friends that Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Yeah. <laugh> stay engaged. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. It's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Weird when you start realizing what your priorities are like that, you know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. So when you move into town, what is the process you go through to basically say, here I am 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b><laugh>, or whatever. Yeah. I mean, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Or, or do you do, or do you depend on sort of like the virtual world to open doors? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>I think it's a little of both. You know, I think, I had a, I have a few friends here that I knew already, both, sort of online and in person. Like, I, I lived in LA when I was 18 years old and spent a couple years here, before moving up north. So I have like, you know, a sort of a, like, a little bit of like a family and social, network here from that. But also, you know, my friend Johnny Woods lives in my neighborhood. And so he and I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1143.485" data-end_ts="1143.685" title="1143.485" id=c_"1143.485">__were__</span>, you know, sort of hanging out right off the bat. And there's these, events that happen almost monthly called Ghosting in la, which is like this really great, like, sort of experimental animation screening slash party that happens in downtown la. It's really, it's a pretty interesting scene. Like, it's almost like going to like a punk rock, like house show, Uhhuh <affirmative>, but, but with like an animation screening attached to it. Wow. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>And I knew about that because they had shown my work a few years ago. I know some people who are involved in organizing it, but that's like, that turned into like a really nice, kind of like, social thing that I could go out to. And I think just like forcing myself to get out of the house a little bit has been the biggest thing. 'cause, 'cause otherwise, like, you know, I, like, I don't know how else to make friends <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I hear you. In a way, one of the things that's kind of interesting to me about sort of like the virtualization of life is that one of the most active areas of virtualization, virtualization that I'm involved in now is like meetups where I find ways to get out of the house and meet humans again. Right. <laugh>, it's hilarious that that's, that's one of the big interactions, you know, far more than Twitter or Facebook at this point. I am a meetup guy. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Yeah. Well, I think, I mean, I, I generally hope that the future of technology is not staring at it <laugh>. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. I hear you <laugh>, the, the chipping planted in your head, and then you can just lay in a vat of something. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1241.335" data-end_ts="1241.685" title="1241.335" id=c_"1241.335">__Right__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>God, I hope not. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. I hope not too. One of the things that you mentioned that I caught wind of recently is that you had done something for Adult Swim. Is that correct? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Yeah, there was, I did a short animation for the Off the Air program, which is directed by, Dave Hughes at Adult Swim. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="1261.845" data-end_ts="1261.965" title="1261.845" id=c_"1261.845">__it__</span> at think it airs at like two or three in the morning on Adult Swim. And it's a really, if you haven't watched that show at all, like, it's like, it was kind of mind blowing when I discovered it because Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, it's, it's, you know, it's, it's a half hour of good music and crazy videos. And he, he manages to dig up, you know, some of my favorite video artists and animators, to, to, contribute work to that show. So I was really happy to be invited to be part of their, they were kind of doing a, like a New Year's edition. Dave approached me and was like, Hey, you know, do you have anything you're working on? And I, I was like, yeah, you know, I've, I have this idea kicking around in my head. It's this very narrative like sci-fi like sort of near future sci-fi character thing. And like, at that point it was like, you know, I had like, some, some character models put together and, a couple of kind of style frames. And I sent that to him and he was like, well, the, the only catch, like, he's like, I love this, but the only catch is you only have a week to work on it 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>And like, you know, we like negotiated over like, you know, how much I would charge them for that and, you know, all that kind of stuff. And like, you know, I was like, okay, well, like that particular week I had, like, I had had like a minor surgery, and so I was, I like, sort of had to be off my feet anyway. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> <laugh>. So I was like, I was like, okay, let's do this <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh my God. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>So it was like a minute, it was like a minute and a half of animation, and I don't, I don't know if I would take on like that kind of a thing on that short of a deadline again, but it was like, it was definitely one of those ones where like, I was kind of like running across the finish line and like, you know, like super excited that I was able to pull it together in time. But it, I, I really like how it turned out and that whole, the whole episode was really pretty cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's fantastic. That sounds, that sounds fun. Now the other thing that I heard about you recently, or I saw recently because they're in my radar anyway, is that you have been invited to the upcoming Moog Fest. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Yeah. I'm super excited about that. I've never been to a Moog Fest before. And it looks 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1402.205" data-end_ts="1402.445" title="1402.205" id=c_"1402.205">__Well__</span>, and it's funny because I think of it as like, related to Moog <span style="color:red" data-ts="1405.815" data-end_ts="1406.165" title="1405.815" id=c_"1405.815">__Sense__</span> and stuff, but really Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> they've developed that into like this combination of a performance festival and, multimedia arts festival. It's, it's a lot broader than just like, Hey, let's tip a beer to Bob Moog. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Yeah. I mean, I was, I was actually just looking at their schedule today and just, I was, I was feeling a little overwhelmed, because like, the, the lineup is just insane. But it's also, it's, it's like, it's not just that they get really great artists to come and perform. They also have this whole kind of conference sort of thing going on where they have like workshops and masterclasses and artist talks and all sorts of things. So I'm going to be doing two things at Moogfest. I'm gonna be doing, I'm gonna be doing live visuals for two of the perfor, like they're doing these ational performances. So I'm gonna be working with Greg Fox, on, on his. And, there's also a, a durational performance by EMA and Jana Hunter, and I'm gonna be splitting that with the other person. I'm travel, one of the other people I'm traveling with, which is rhe McNamara. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Can you explain <span style="color:red" data-ts="1480.045" data-end_ts="1480.325" title="1480.045" id=c_"1480.045">__what__</span> the durational performance is? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>I think I can <laugh> <laugh>, the way I understand it is they're sort of multi-hour musical performances, so high probability that it's gonna be a total noodle fest. Right, right. Which I'm kind of into, like, I'm really 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Can be fun. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Like my only knowledge of Greg Fox's music is like him doing these sort of amazing drum solos. Yeah, no kidding. I mean, he's like a very super talented drummer. So I'm like, I'm sort of waiting to see what he pulls out and like, like, am I gonna be doing visuals for a like a four hour drum solo <laugh>? Like that sounds amazing. So, so I'm, I'm, I'm super excited about that. We'll see Suzanne Cone's doing one as well that my friend JJ is doing visuals for. And that's gonna be really amazing 'cause she's sort of this hero of like modular synthesis and 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. She's the hero of mine, believe me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Yeah. And, and my friend JJ Stratford is, she's a really amazing, analog video, artist. So she uses like, you know, the LZX modules and I think she has a Fairlight video processor. Oh my goodness. And, and she just, like, she's just a really cool person too, and like, she really like, I don't know, I feel like she kind of gets into character too, <laugh> when she performs, which is, so impressive to me. But yeah. And so we're, we're actually, we're going there together as, under the banner of the under Volt and Company, video label. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>And we're like, so Moog Fest made a deal with them that we would, provide the, all the live visuals for the durational performances at Moogfest. And then, both, JJ and I, and her, her collaborator, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1601.025" data-end_ts="1601.445" title="1601.025" id=c_"1601.025">__Steffy__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1601.675" data-end_ts="1601.965" title="1601.675" id=c_"1601.675">__Dula__</span>, are gonna be, I hope I pronounced her name right, are gonna be doing workshops as well. So I'm doing one, I believe it's called like, software as part of the creative process. And, JJs gonna be doing a, a workshop about analog video synthesis with Stephanie. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. So this is, you say this is part of the Undervolt video label? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. I've never really personally experienced the video label before. Can you explain a little bit more about what that is? Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>I mean, I think there's a couple kind of examples of this throughout history, but there're really kind of taking the sort of record label metaphor and applying it to, experimental video and animation and the, the idea, I think it was originally, Yoshi Socca, Johnny Woods, and, I think Nicholas O'Brien was also one of the founding members of Under Volten Company. And their, their original idea was to sell artist made videos as albums. So, Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So they approached a number of different artists to make these sort of video albums. My favorite of which is probably Jacob Chichis, I might be, I I, I'm not sure if it's actually under Extreme Animals or under Jacob's name himself. And then Sabrina <span style="color:red" data-ts="1683.655" data-end_ts="1684.005" title="1683.655" id=c_"1683.655">__Ratta__</span> has a really great one. Brenna Murphy also, has a really good one. And then recently they've started doing what they're calling singles. And these are just sort of s like a single video without the whole kind of like album thing. And I did one of those, I did like a, an animation video for that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So where, where do I go to, I mean, and is this something that's sold or is it just like a packaging concept or is it a, is it a marketing mechanism for something else? What is the <laugh>? You know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>You know what I mean? It's all of the above. So their, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1720.895" data-end_ts="1721.245" title="1720.895" id=c_"1720.895">__their__</span> original notion was that they were, you know, they're, they're selling these things, so it was like, you know, sort of a, an experiment <span style="color:red" data-ts="1727.945" data-end_ts="1728.165" title="1727.945" id=c_"1727.945">__in__</span> can we sell art videos? Like they are MP three downloads, you know? Right, right. And I think they also made them available as DVDs as well, at least for the first several of them. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So there is some kind of like merchandise aspect to it. But then what Johnny was telling me recently, one of these sort of side effects of having this roster of artists associated with you is that there are institutions all over the world that like need to fill programming. Right. And you, you know, like maybe they don't have a curator on staff who knows a whole lot about what's happening in experimental video. Right. And so they get calls from all over the place just saying like, Hey, can you guys put together like an hour long screening for us? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>So all of a sudden being associated with this crew of people is like, you know, you, it's, it's, it's sort of like a just add water curatorial thing, you know, it's, and like, you know, they'll send out this really great screening of, some of my favorite artists all one, set, you know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So first of all, in the show notes, I'll make sure I point people, again, to your lo the location of your work. But why don't we just say it here because quite frankly, a lot of consolidators get their hands on my podcast, and some of those people never get a chance to look at my website. So where do we go to look at your work, first of all? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Probably the best place to start would be my website, which is PIX lpa.com. And then beyond that, probably like, there's my Vimeo account as well, under the same name. And those are, those are probably like the best starting places. I, I feel like, I, you know, as, as widely ranging as, as, I mean as wide ranging as my work is, I also just sort of throw it out there all over the place, <laugh>. So <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You do, because actually I interact a lot with it based on things that you post on, I think mostly on Twitter is where, see where I see sort of your like, oh, here's something I just squirted out. You know? It's always, it's always, it's kind of a cool way to keep track of you because I kind of feel like I'm like standing outside your studio and all of a sudden a piece of paper comes flying out the window <laugh> or something. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>That's good. I mean, I, I feel like, you know, that's, that's really the brand I'm trying to create on Twitter, you know, as the, like <laugh> like studio visit experience. Right. You know, no, but I, yeah, I, I tend to kind of use Twitter as sort of like a, a little bit of like a, a testing ground for weird ideas that I'm having and, you know, in the moment kind of work in progress kind of stuff. Sure. So yeah, I do post a lot of that sort of stuff on there mostly is like kind of animated gifs. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. And then who are you, you've mentioned a couple of times, like some of your favorite animators and stuff. Do me a favor and drop some names for people. So <span style="color:red" data-ts="1922.845" data-end_ts="1922.965" title="1922.845" id=c_"1922.845">__a__</span> an awful lot of the people I interview, and a lot of the people that listen are really focused on the music side of art and music, but, a lot of them, when I talk to 'em, they're like, I'm curious, I wanna know more. Who do I start looking at? Who do I get into? So why don't you drop some names and, and give people a chance to do a little, a little web surfing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Sure. I mean, I want to give sort of a caveat at the beginning of like, these, these things are always a minefield because, you're not gonna mention like your best friend on accident, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, oh, believe me, the whole point of this question is to get you in trouble. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Yeah. <laugh>. So, so like, you know, if I, you know, <laugh>, I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings here. But I think sort of like people who've done recent things that have caught my eye, I, I think like, sort of wanna focus on that is, my friend JJ Stratford that I mentioned earlier, I think she often goes by Jennifer Juniper, Stratford online, the, there's, Brenna Murphy and Birch Cooper, who often perform together as, Cher or Ms. hr do really great work together and separately as well. Ian Chang is a New York based artist that I really like. I feel like he and I are always kind of on a parallel trajectory, even though our work is extremely different from one another. He just did this iPhone app, which is like a meditation game where you are trying to control a corgi. It's called Bad Corgi. It's like, it's actually kind of amazing and I'm like, it's like one of my favorite things right now. <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sounds awesome. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Besides that, Johnny Woods, good friend of mine, does some really amazing animations and Susie polling, is an artist, here in LA who was also once from the Bay Area as well. Does some really fantastic work, both as a, as a performer and as a kind of installation and video artist. Trying to think like, you know, I'm sure I'm forgetting a million great people, but, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2054.015" data-end_ts="2054.365" title="2054.015" id=c_"2054.015">__those__</span>, I, I think I'll leave it with that list for now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That's a pretty, pretty tasty list. Yeah. Well, Andrew, I want to thank you again for spending time. It's fantastic. Get caught up. It was great to kind of hear your perspectives on my scary upcoming move and the fact that you have absolutely no real advice for me, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2074.385" data-end_ts="2074.605" title="2074.385" id=c_"2074.385">__No__</span>, it'll be great. It'll be fine. <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'll, I'll make it right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>It's always, I I think ev each of those kinds of things, there is an opportunity for growing and a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2084.825" data-end_ts="2085.045" title="2084.825" id=c_"2084.825">__way__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2085.065" data-end_ts="2085.285" title="2085.065" id=c_"2085.065">__you__</span> didn't expect. So, it'll be good. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And, but also just, thanks for talking about the process of being a professional. I think that's an area that, you know, pe people are just scared to talk about it. They, they feel uncomfortable because it either seems like you're sort of like sullying the art <laugh>, right? Yeah. Or conversely, like, you're either being, you're either bragging or admitting defeat, right? And so I think you walked a really nice line of just sort of like saying, here's what it kinda looks like, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Yeah. I mean, I, I, I am hesitant to say that anybody else's experience is gonna look like anything like mine, but you know, I think, I think everybody's just trying to figure it out as they go. And definitely one of those people <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, fantastic. Thanks a lot for sharing what you have learned. I really do appreciate it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nobody: </b><i>Yeah, no problem. Alright, </i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Man. Catch you soon. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>All right. Talk to you later, Darwin Bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, I think we all got some advice that we can <span style="color:red" data-ts="2157.605" data-end_ts="2157.805" title="2157.605" id=c_"2157.605">__eat__</span> in that, chat. That was really interesting. And if you haven't checked out Andrew's work, you really need to, it's, some amazing stuff. Well, I'm sitting here in, the mountains of Colorado, right in the middle of Snowpocalypse or dump zilla or whatever they want. We've got about, let's say three and a half to four feet of snow in the last day and a half. So <span style="color:red" data-ts="2183.725" data-end_ts="2183.845" title="2183.725" id=c_"2183.725">__I__</span> ain't going anywhere, but you get to, so maybe go out and have a coffee for me or nice Sunday brunch, or if you're listening to this in a week <span style="color:red" data-ts="2193.005" data-end_ts="2193.125" title="2193.005" id=c_"2193.005">__a__</span> day, make sure that you swing by your favorite coffee shop and have one for me. I hope that you enjoy the podcast and I hope that, I'll get a chance to talk to you again next week. Thanks a lot.
