<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. This week we have a very special guest, a man that I consider it a great, pleasure and honor to be a friend, friend with, his name's Brad <span style="color:red" data-ts="24.7" data-end_ts="24.94" title="24.7" id=c_"24.7">__Garden__</span>. He is the head of the cmc, computer Music Center at Columbia University. He's also a really interesting developer of stuff. And by stuff I mean interesting software tools and software creations, for the computer and computer music. Hi, Brad. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad Garton: </b>Hi, Darwin And, the feeling of friendship and honor is mutual <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, thank you. I appreciate that. <span style="color:red" data-ts="56.5" data-end_ts="56.62" title="56.5" id=c_"56.5">__I__</span>, as, is typical for the, for the podcast, especially when we're introducing people for the first time. I like to ask them to give us a little bit of their background. Now, I know you have a really interesting background, particularly because you were doing computer music when computer music wasn't easy. And so if you could give us just a little bit of your history, your personal history, and maybe some of the work that you've done, that would be a great starting point. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>Okay. Well, yeah. Interesting maybe is is quite a word. I have a number of undergraduate advisees, where I, I teach at Columbia, and, they come to me with their life all planned out, and I tell them, don't ever underestimate the fundamental randomness of life. Because I actually didn't start really in music, even though I had loved music and had done it since, you know, I can remember, my undergraduate degrees in pharmacy and essentially I'm a failed pharmacist <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that puts you in a good spot. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>Yeah, it's, it's kind of weird. But, basically what happened was I went to Purdue University because of course, you know, had to get a real education and get a real job. And music wasn't one of those jobs in the Midwest. And the really good thing that happened there, well, two good things. First of all, in Lafayette, there wasn't a whole lot back then in the way of entertainment. So we had to kind of make our own. So I got involved with a lot of bands, actually, I've been involved in bands since junior high school. But I also met a friend, Rick Thomas, who is a, now the chairman of the theater program there at Purdue. And we started a recording studio. And that was kind of the downfall of my academic career back then, even though I did finally manage to graduate. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>But, I began to spend much more time in the studio than I did, you know, doing things like going to classes and such and just fell in love with, you know, tech technology and using it to craft sound. Of course, back then it was all analog. You know, we had some Moog Microm synthesizers. I had an old orchestra, you know, all the, all the fun stuff, right. And, so, you know, eventually I had to get a job. And through my job, I met the woman that became my wife, and she was a Jersey girl. So I decided to move out to New Jersey. This is early 1980s. And I thought, you know, I've been hearing in the business recording studio your business about this new stuff called Digital Sound <laugh>. And I thought maybe I better learn about this digital sound. And I looked at New Jersey and I said, where, where are they doing stuff in digital sound? And, well, there's Princeton right in the middle of New Jersey where we were gonna be living. And I thought, what the heck? I'll apply there and learn about digital sound <laugh>. I, I didn't realize it was actually hard to get into the program <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>And to this day, I can't understand why. They, they accepted me as one of their incoming grad students. I must have made up something to impress them. But, we started out, I came on board about 19 82, 83, and, Paul Lansky just retired last month. <span style="color:red" data-ts="234.01" data-end_ts="234.3" title="234.01" id=c_"234.01">__Well__</span>, he's, he's one of the right big mentors in my life. You know, he's one of the luminaries in computer music. And he sat me down when I arrived and said, well, here's the manual. I'll take you down to the computer center, because that's where we used to have to work, where they had a big IBM 30 81 mainframe. Oh my. And I think it had maybe, you know, 10 K of Ram, whoa, <laugh>. And that was basically the machine that we used to, to make audio. And the process of making audio back then was that you had to type up programs. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>And it's funny because it shows how close we were to the, the really ancient days, the lines of code that we typed, we called cards, each line was a card. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, because, you know, actually when I learned <span style="color:red" data-ts="279.22" data-end_ts="279.34" title="279.22" id=c_"279.22">__a__</span> computer at Purdue, we actually had to type out punch cards and submit the deck. And the process was that you would then submit this job on the mainframe, wait for about three hours, and then you could go and check out a tape that you could then take across campus to another lab, the Godfrey Winham studio, as it was called back then, and put the tape on a mini computer. It was a, a dated general. <span style="color:red" data-ts="305.22" data-end_ts="305.34" title="305.22" id=c_"305.22">__I__</span> don't think it was a Nova. No, it was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data">PD</a>P 11, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data">PD</a>P 1134. Sorry. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>Yeah. Sorry. I know you don't wanna get into the old guy stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>No, no. I mean, old guy radio is pretty fun sometimes, especially when you're talking about some of this creaky old hardware. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>Oh, man. It was, it was wild. But anyhow, you know, we, we check out the tape, this digital tape, put it on this other computer, and then initiate conversion by typing in some, you know, hex addresses and <laugh>, you know, after three hours you discovered you'd mistyped one of your cards and your masterpiece went click. And that was about it, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>So it was, it was quite a time, you know. But, the, the really cool thing that happened while I was there at Princeton was second year of my graduate program, we negotiated, or Paul Lansky negotiated an agreement where we moved off the mainframe and moved onto what were called mini computers at the time, these were called Microvax tools that we got. And as part of that, we moved to a new operating system, which was relatively unknown back then called Unix. And I was part of the team, it was me, Paul Lansky, Andy Milburn, Dave <span style="color:red" data-ts="375.29" data-end_ts="375.58" title="375.29" id=c_"375.29">__MedU__</span>, Lars <span style="color:red" data-ts="376.58" data-end_ts="376.66" title="376.58" id=c_"376.58">__Graph__</span>, a few others that actually did the porting of the original computer music language mix, which came from Fortran four, BF Music four BF from Fortran to C. And that was just an incredible experience to be there, to be able to help build a computer music language, and to be involved in that kind of excitement of creating something new. And that kind of was how I rounded out my graduate career at Princeton. Ultimately, how, how much do you wanna know? Do you wanna know about like, dissertation stuff and all that nonsense? Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>If, if you think it's relevant, I just think it's, I think it's just really interesting to kind of hear this kind of movement, because I, I think an awful lot of people don't recognize sort of like the grueling nature of, of making these, making the transitions. I mean, now it's sort of like we <span style="color:red" data-ts="427.49" data-end_ts="427.78" title="427.49" id=c_"427.49">__raid__</span> around rather impatiently for people to create software for us so that we can make music. And the idea of like, you know, you can't really make music until you get done with your fortran to see conversion is actually a pretty hilarious and, and completely unthinkable mode of operation. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b><laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But, but also, also pretty wonderful, because the fact is you probably knew what that, what that program you, you knew what the <span style="color:red" data-ts="459.34" data-end_ts="459.54" title="459.34" id=c_"459.34">__mix__</span> program did at such a fundamental level. How did that affect the way that you worked with that software? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>Actually that's a, that's a really good, question. And, it's kind of a really relevant point that I try and kind of communicate to our students. You know, what I did when I came to Columbia, it's funny you mentioned how you had to do all this stuff before I could even make sound, first thing I had to do is write a piece of cold call a device driver for Sun workstations. Jesus. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>Yeah. It's, it's non trivial <laugh>. No. So that's, that's how I spent the summer before my classes, you know, just crashing computers all day long. But I mean, and that level of code come on, you don't really need to know that. But knowing the languages, knowing the technology, knowing the capabilities, you know, to me, this is the key to unlocking possibilities that, you know, technology provides, you know, imagining things, imagining ways of, of being creative, doing your art that, that you, that you won't necessarily think of. Just kind of like taking stuff from off the shelf and adopting paradigms that, that kind of currently exist. You know, I'm, I'm not a big fan of concerts, for example. You know, I really, the idea of a computer music concert, although now it's much better because of all the interactivity that's going on. But back in the olden days when you'd go to a computer music concert and basically they would play tapes. Right. That was just weird to me. You know, <laugh>. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, you, you, the tape recorder would occupy the center of the stage. Very, very strange. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>Yeah. Yeah. And it's funny because at, at Columbia, at Princeton, we actually tried to make almost a fetish of this. And we'd do things like set up the concert stage, like a, like a living room and put the tape recorder right there and say, brought you into our living room, you know, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="569.24" data-end_ts="569.46" title="569.24" id=c_"569.24">__was__</span>, tried to try kind of deconstruct that a little bit. So yeah, I, you know, I think knowledge of the technology can really do a lot towards giving you, like I said, opportunities, creative opportunities that, that you might not discover otherwise. And to me, that's also the big excitement of this era. You know, we've got these incredible machines that can pretty much do what we tell them to do. And it's been marvelous to see how that has taken root in terms of people developing new interface technologies, you know, new ways of interacting with sound, new ways of sculpting, and creating sound. I'm fortunate because I have a front row seat at that, you know, through all our students, through our program. That's a, that's a real big gift for me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Well, let's go back to kind of how you, you came up through the ranks, because I have heard rumors that, you getting to your position at Columbia was, actually kind of a crazy ride. So tell us a little bit about how you went from being, Paul Lansky's Sea Monkey <laugh> to, to your current position at Columbia. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>Well, this is another one of those opportunities that technology can provide <laugh>. Right. Basically what happened, I'll just give you the, the naked story is, Russ Pinkston had, he was the director of the Computer Music Center at Columbia. Russ is a really great friend. He's teaching now at University of Texas, Austin, which actually factors into this story. Like I said, I had to write the device driver for these sun workstations. He'd ordered a couple of really high <span style="color:red" data-ts="677.7" data-end_ts="677.9" title="677.7" id=c_"677.7">__end__</span> back then Sun 3, 2 80 s workstations, you know, whoa. Cool. Right. He promptly got a, an offer, tenured offer from University of Texas, Austin, that Columbia could not match. And so he made his choice, a smart one, and moved to UT Austin, where he now teaches and, has been on faculty for years. Sure. And so they're, you know, they're coming up, I think this <span style="color:red" data-ts="702.5" data-end_ts="702.66" title="702.5" id=c_"702.5">__was__</span> happening, you know, offers go out in academia at the end of April, you know, and Russ had accepted the offer. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>It's May, they got these new computers arriving in two weeks, and they need to teach classes the following fall. So they called up Paul Lansky, Mario, David Osky said, do you have somebody who can teach? You don't know these stuff, these computers, <laugh>. And, and Paul suggested a couple people. I was closest to getting my dissertation done. And, you know, I, I knew the tech. So they, I don't think they listened to any of my music, to be honest. I just went up and talked with Mario and George Edwards, and they said, oh, alright, you're hired. So <laugh>, I just got in and, you know, just started working with machines and running the place the way that I thought might be kind of fun to run, which is also steeped by my experience at Princeton. You know, not just Paul Lansky, but Jim Randall, who sadly just passed away about a week and a half ago. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>Oh my. They had a really, really great take on what it means to build a community, what it means to do music together. And, you know, a lot of people go, oh, computers, especially back then, oh, they're so cold and sterile. I found exactly the opposite that because of this shared enterprise, you know, we would, a group of us would come together and we'd really kind of, you know, become great friends. Actually. I mean, to this day, all these people that, you know, started in the early days and up through now, you know, students and whatever, Columbia were all kind of hanging out. But anyhow, so I had to, I had to go up and, you know, do all this stuff. And I started having fun. And, and I kind of realized early on something that proved to be a really great realization. I figured that I had no chance of getting tenure at Columbia <laugh>, because, you know, my music, you know, it's, it's fairly tonal, pretty straightforward, kind of weird in a very non-academic way, you know, and I wasn't sort of following what Mario would call the grand tradition of music, you know, where you're, you're overly concerned with pitch relations in a, in a very strange way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>And, you know, it's kind of like a, a really refined version of high modernism and music. Right. You know? Right. And that, that wasn't me at all. You know, I was just saying, whoa, listen to what this could do. Whoa, I'll try <span style="color:red" data-ts="836.11" data-end_ts="836.46" title="836.11" id=c_"836.11">__spend__</span>. Well, that's cool. You know, so it wasn't people underestimate it, was it, I always say it wasn't intellectual in a sense, but actually it really was, but intellectual in a very different sense, than the standard sort of line. So, you know, kind of go along. And in fact, my tenure bid at Columbia started with the department chairman calling me into his office and saying, well, Brad, the department figures you have no chance in hell, so we're not even gonna bother to nominate you. So that was how I started my tenure bid. Things had changed. Several faculty had left Columbia. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>They'd gotten better offers elsewhere, which proved to be, removal of particular roadblocks for me. And my hero, Fred Laal, who's one of my colleagues at Columbia, said, we have to keep this person. This guy's really, he knows a lot about computers and computer music. And fortunately, again, technology came to my rescue. Right. And the other thing that was set in place that I didn't appreciate until afterwards is that the higher administration, Columbia really wanted me to stay, because back then, this is mid 1990s, there was a big push to put technology, especially in art and humanities departments. Right. And I was the guy who could do that in the music department. So once Fred began to kind of make some serious noise, and Fred is good at that <laugh>, the department changed its mind, and then tenure happened. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Wow. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>So, here I am. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's kind of interesting that, technology sort of paved the way for that. To what extent did that have to do with funding? Because back, back in the day, one of the reasons that technology kind of got, wedged into almost any area of study was because, because there was funding either by the computer companies themselves or by the government who wanted to try and find some way to, to push technology, because that was something that was deemed sellable. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>Yeah. That was a big, I'm sure that was part of the administration's endorsement of me too. Right. I discovered that I was actually very good at fundraising back then, <laugh>. And I, I had a really great team. I mean, Thanasis Occus is working for us now. He's now, I think Executive Vice Provost for Technology at Carney Ballon. I can't remember the job title, but he and I put together a lot of stuff. Terry Pender was working with us, Terry's still with us. And we hired, actually, we hired Dan Truman to work for us for a while. This is before he got his job at Princeton. And, Douglas or Petto came on board. So we had a, a really wonderful team of people. And 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>We, I mean, that's, that's like the luminaries of, of the context now. It's That's really an amazing group of people. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1017.12" data-end_ts="1017.34" title="1017.12" id=c_"1017.12">__And__</span> it's funny, I'll take a little side road here. It was with that group, and especially some of the students that we had back then, you know, leading into, I listened to your podcast with Jeff Snyder. Yeah. Oh, man, <laugh>, that made me feel pretty good. <laugh>. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. He's, he thinks you guys are made a gold. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>Yeah. Well, and some of that was, it's funny, I don't really do that hardware, physical computing stuff. I'm a software guy. Right. And with these people like Doug and Dan and, and Jeff and Sam Pluto, and, Daniel Glacia, I mean, all these guys, you know, they were kind of there and they were really interested in this stuff, and I learned the virtue of stepping aside and letting them do their work. Right. You know, and, that was a, that was a really great lesson to have. You know, some people when confronted with something they don't do or understand will say, no, we're doing it this, this way. Right. You know, that's, that's not me. <laugh> I learned early on. No, that's, that's the, that's the bad thing to do. Right. But anyhow, we, like I said, we became, well, the fact that we had such a huge staff, for example, you know, and I was able to secure enough money that basically the Computer Music Center has been existing on Soft Money up until about two years ago, a year ago. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>And that's when we put in place, we have a new master's program in Sound Arts that Douglass <span style="color:red" data-ts="1100.9" data-end_ts="1101.02" title="1100.9" id=c_"1100.9">__Rep__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1101.02" data-end_ts="1101.18" title="1101.02" id=c_"1101.02">__PET__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1101.18" data-end_ts="1101.34" title="1101.18" id=c_"1101.18">__is__</span> the director of. Right. And that was an occasion for us to rethink our budget and redo things. And now the Computer Music Center does not require external fundraising. Wow. But again, back in the 1990s, that was, that was a big part of it. And like I said, I was very successful at doing that. I also learned, in fact, we all learned at the cmc, to be careful about fundraising, because when you write grants to do things, you didn't have to do the things that you said to <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It comes with expectations. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>Right. And, you know, this is interesting. I, again, I was lucky because a lot of the money I raised, we had a guy working in the university development office who set it up as gift accounts rather than grants. Okay. And that gave us a lot more freedom. One of the fundamental differences <span style="color:red" data-ts="1151.12" data-end_ts="1151.34" title="1151.12" id=c_"1151.12">__at__</span> Columbia in a number of places I visited is that graduate students and fellows in arts and humanities don't realize sometimes how good they have it. All of my colleagues in the engineering, the hard sciences, even though they get huge grants and they have access to NSF monies, or hopefully they still will. Right. They have to provide all the support for their graduate students and their labs through that fundraising. We have blanket fellowships, and like I said, a good budget at the CMC where I don't have to do any fundraising ever again if I don't want to. And that's incredible. You know, we can continue to do what we like to do. Then we can say, well, let's see if we can get some money to do this thing that we would like to try to do. Right. That's a really great position to be in. So, boy, this is pretty boring. Darwin I mean, <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You know what, though? It's not, I don't know. It's, it's interesting because with these podcasts, one of the things that I found is that every person is interacting with the world of art and music and technology in a completely different way than everyone else. And so, while it's probably boring to you, because you've lived this for the last 20 years, nobody else really gets to see this stuff in action. You know, we all understand, oh, all right. There's this music school, and I see occasionally pictures of this really big <span style="color:red" data-ts="1235.36" data-end_ts="1235.58" title="1235.36" id=c_"1235.36">__com__</span> really big, synthesizer thing in Brad's office. But, how does that even exist? And, you know, I think that, I think that there's an awful lot of curiosity about how these programs work, because you know, in fact, your program is responsible for producing a lot of really interesting people coming out of it, and people who do atypical things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And I think this goes back to something you said earlier about your own music, which is that your music, I, I would say, I, I have this kind of like joke about how, in order to, in order to listen to most academic music, you have to have a certain amount of hair coming out of your ears, <laugh>, you know, and if you go to most, I mean, even if you go to like AEs, you can walk around and say, oh, okay. There's a person that comes outta the academic music world, <laugh>. Cause they have big bushes coming outta <span style="color:red" data-ts="1290.5" data-end_ts="1290.66" title="1290.5" id=c_"1290.5">__their__</span> ears. Right. What, what's interesting to me is that your music, when I, when I listen to your music, you've, you've shared with me some really interesting stuff, which is how algorithmically you've done sort of like Irish fiddle tunes or, kind of algorithmically and with some sonic tweaks, all of a sudden you're doing Prague Rock Tunes, which a lot of people wouldn't think of being part of the academic world. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But I think that that's because, well, I'm not sure what, that's what why that is, but one of the things that I would say is that I came up through sort of the academic thing. I too, in my early days, I actually got to work on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data">PD</a>P 11, helping hand wire audio boards to try and make an ear training system for it. And I remember back then having a computer generate, generate a blues, a 12 bar blues was so amazing that it didn't matter that it was a 12 bar blues. Right. And so there was a sense of wonder that came along with that, that was, unless, unless you really felt the need to do the high modernist thing, there was just a joyfulness in just being able to make the damn thing do something. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>Yeah. Yeah. You know, it's funny, that gets back to that, you know, when I said it's intellectual in a different sort of way. Right. You know, that's exactly what I'm talking about. You know, that there's this, there's this, engagement that you can have by exploring the capabilities of these systems, you know, and, you know, doing some pretty serious thinking about what does it mean to have a device that I can tell it what to do, and it may not do what I tell it, but <laugh> I'll do something bizarre. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, but, and there was also another thing which I think, you know, because of your background you came up with and probably were very aware of as well, especially since you're not a concert head. For me, one of the things that really entranced me about computers and music was the fact that I could, I could do and test drive orchestration without having to formulate a gathering of people. You know? So it used to be that if I wanted to try doing a jazz chart, I would at the least have to find five people that would, you know, stop huffing a bong long enough to <laugh>, you know, to play a, to, to try out a track. Right. Right. Or in, in an even worse case, if I wanted to do something that was orchestral in nature, it was, it was gonna be <span style="color:red" data-ts="1461.16" data-end_ts="1461.38" title="1461.16" id=c_"1461.16">__ni__</span> impossible for me to do it. And so all of a sudden, the computer o offered the opportunity to try things out without the embarrassment of saying, okay, I got you all together. And what I just did stinks, you know, <laugh>, it gave me the chance to be an editor, which sadly, maybe I've overdone a bit. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b><laugh>, I don't think so. Darwin 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I don't know, I don't have very much work out there because, the second that I, that I actually seal something up, I listen to it and I'm like, well, I can do better than that. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>You know, but this, this is the, this is the case where, you know, step back a bit and, and you see that opportunity, because I would say that, you know, by focusing on what you might think of as the end product, you know, actually getting stuff quote out there mm-hmm. <affirmative> or something like that, you're, you're kind of missing the point of what it is you're doing. You know, and for me, music is all, like I said, that word, academic word engagement, it's all about this engagement you have with something, you know, and, and to me, the most profoundly musical I've seen you be is when you're sitting back fooling around with your analog monstrosity <laugh>. Right, right. And plugging in things and everything like that, you know, and, and saying, oh, well, that's not really it. You know, I'm gonna do something then, and then, you know, present it to an audience that, that's kind of missing what the real musical action is. Right. You know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1545.18" data-end_ts="1545.46" title="1545.18" id=c_"1545.18">__cause__</span> the musical action is that editing process that you do and, that kind of engagement. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I wish, I just, I just wish, you know, we, we both maybe suffer a little bit from the Midwestern thing, which is I wish I had the ability to just say, Hey, I just laid a turd and it seems kinda golden, so let's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1562.85" data-end_ts="1563.14" title="1562.85" id=c_"1562.85">__rock__</span> it out there. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>There you go. There you go. Yeah. And you know what, I, I need to kind of tamper what I'm saying a little bit, but you, you're talking about, people with different backgrounds in different ways of making their way in the world. You know, and I look at you and how you've managed to negotiate these things and rise to a position of, you know, some authority in the world. I feel like I love, I won the lottery, you know, I hear you. Few people I recognize have the kind of job that I do where I have the freedom and the support to do what I do. And to me, that says that signals, well, you have this sort of station where you've arrived. What can you do from there? You know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Yeah. That's actually a really great point. And, and kind of to further that point, and, and to kind of tie it in with this idea of releasing material, I'm curious what you think about <span style="color:red" data-ts="1619.56" data-end_ts="1619.78" title="1619.56" id=c_"1619.56">__co__</span> the, the development of software and the creation of code as actually being an artistic release. And I put that in quote marks, but not very big quote marks. Yeah. Because to a certain extent, I feel like whether it's the code that I've cut for a variety of people that I've worked with, or documentation that I've done, or, examples or tutorials or workshops, I feel that those things, because of their effect on the world, represent the best artistic releases that I've done in, in sort of like practical terms. Yeah. Now, do I, do I always consider it that way? I don't know. But again, I, I feel lucky to be in the position I'm in, and I too feel like I've won the lottery. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And so I, I dat Lord this over anyone. But I do feel like, in a way, a lot of my artistic production ends up as lines of code and the art that goes behind it. You know? So if I make something and it's code, it's always backed up by sort of like, trying it in an artful context, trying it in front of an audience, trying it as part of a recording process or whatever. And so there's an art, there's artfulness that ties into it. And I've often had trouble kind of describing my feelings about that, because it either sounds like I'm being too, I don't know, not not promoting myself in as an artist. You know, I, I used to have this thing where I like, well, I'm making paintbrushes for Picasso, which is kind of a stupid way to say it, because, but, but in a way, I feel like the things that I'm making from a coat standpoint are really an artistic output. Now, you have developed a lot of different code <span style="color:red" data-ts="1735.15" data-end_ts="1735.5" title="1735.15" id=c_"1735.15">__based__</span> results. The RT Cix project probably being the, the primary one would, would, would that be correct? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>I, I'd say yes. I mean, I've done, you know, the, the 12 hour blue stuff and everything like that, a lot of the simulation thing that was all done with List and mm-hmm. <affirmative>, you know, for a while I was on this mission of trying to embed every computer language known to man and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1756.02" data-end_ts="1756.22" title="1756.02" id=c_"1756.02">__Kn__</span> and s p <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Watch out about that <laugh>. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>I know. I mean, but, I, I think the, the real, oh, we had Miller Puckett and I had this kind of fun back and forth where I embedded <span style="color:red" data-ts="1766.94" data-end_ts="1767.06" title="1766.94" id=c_"1766.94">__p__</span> what was it? He had embedded pd embedded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data">PD</a> reinvented it, so you could actually like, call each environment like recursively <laugh>. So it was really horrible. It's funny because you, you did something there. I was, was gonna jump all over you, you know, I'm glad you put the small quotes around Right. You know, you're doing with your code. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1785.82" data-end_ts="1785.94" title="1785.82" id=c_"1785.82">__Cause__</span> you jumped all over me about this in the past, so 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>I know, I know, I know. I take the quotes away and, you know, what I'd say is like, but you know, when you are actually developing the code, that's what it is. That's the artistic action right there, you know? And I said, don't, don't focus on this final object that you've done, because that's the path to evil, you know, <laugh>. But then you, you, you tempered it and you talked about how you then, the, the real kick for you in a certain way, beyond developing the code, which is, you know, pretty amazing, is when you then use it in an artistic context. Right. You know, when you're in a recording session or when you're performing on stage or something like that. You know, and that's a, that's I think a really good point, you know, that, you know, there are many ways that these sort of artistic objects that we create can function. You know, I think what I bridle against is when people try to restrict that functionality and they say, well, all this code you've done, that's just an adjunct for this, the real activity. Right. You know, and that's what you, you run into that in academia all the time. Yeah. That's a whole high modernist nonsense that just drives me crazy, you know? But anyhow, yeah. Well there's, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>There is this sense, you know, like, and, and it's, it's a concern because a lot of people sort of reject academia because the academia has this tendency to say there's art and there's craft. Yeah. And we give no benefits to craftiness. We, we give, we give acknowledgement only to art. And especially as, you know, throughout the development of computer music, but also as computer music becomes more normalized, that seems to be a really ridiculous kind of bifurcation. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>Right. Right. I, and I, I like, you know, who, who are these people that make that distinction? You know, <laugh>, come on, gimme a break. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Right. Good 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>Point. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>There are people who can't do craft. That's who it's, right. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>I know. That's true. That's true. The one thing I will kind of say in academia's defense, though, and this is, it's been a long time in coming, but I do detect the climate is much different now, you know, based on what I see, say our students doing, our former students, you know, out in the world and things like that, is that, if you take academia as a place where you essentially have untrammeled freedom in a way you cannot find elsewhere, that's the best. Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1924.98" data-end_ts="1925.1" title="1924.98" id=c_"1924.98">__That__</span> can, you know, because, you know, once you, once you say, well, let's get rid, it's funny, some people <span style="color:red" data-ts="1930.3" data-end_ts="1930.58" title="1930.3" id=c_"1930.3">__face__</span> with that freedom. They wanna make those distinctions between art and craft, because then they wanna say, well, I need to legitimize my work, so therefore I'll construct this artificial intellectual edifice, you know, that says, this is what I'm really doing here. You know, jettison that. And what you're left with is a vast field of play where you can just do amazing stuff. And, like I said, I, in my happier moments, I think that's what the, the world is becoming. You know, maybe that's not quite true, but <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I don't know. I think it is Now I want to kind of dive into this a little further, especially as it relates to you and working with your students. I just got done rereading for probably the 20th time, the book Art and Fear. Ah, and one of the things that they talk about in there is that how, for a great majority of, you know, it's mostly oriented around art school rather than music school, but I think it, it applies in this case, they talk about how, oftentimes the last show that people do as students is the last show that they ever do in their lives. Because, because when they're in school, they're focused on doing these, on, on creating these, these works and putting them in front of people. And, but when the pressure to have to do that is gone, most people tend not to, not to follow up on it right now, I would say that that's true in all kinds of artistic things, except one of the things I notice is it tends to not be true with your students. And Jeff, Jeff Snyder is a perfect example, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>Or Luke Deis, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Or Luke <span style="color:red" data-ts="2040.97" data-end_ts="2041.26" title="2040.97" id=c_"2040.97">__Deis__</span> is another great example. What is it you think that propels or compels people to continue their work after they leave school? I mean, do you think that it's something at Columbia? Do you think it's something about the location in New York and kind of the community and the aspects of New York that make it kind of special? What, what do you think kind of drives that into, into happening? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>I think, well, New York is a part of it, you know, and the, the group of incredible students we get every year at Columbia is another part. But there's a, there's a missing ingredient. And, you know, because these students, a lot of people will go out and they'll go elsewhere. You know, Mara Helme is now in Cincinnati, you know, Doug when he was back in Minnesota, and, and they'll still continue to do the work. So the New York thing isn't an essential, is isn't a necessary ingredient. I think what it is, is that we, we let our students do what they want to do, <laugh> mm-hmm. <affirmative>, you know, and that's, believe it or not, that's kind of a big deal. You know, a lot of programs. I know, oh man, Dan Truman, when I met him, I was teaching for a year at Cincinnati, and Dan was ready to just jettison music, you know, not to, not to cast aspersions on Cincinnati, because it's a great place, especially, especially with Mara Mara there now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>Right. Doing fabulous work. Yeah. But he was, he was actually, majoring in music theory. That was his, master's work. And he was just completely disillusioned by the whole enterprise because, you know, I went to see Dan play in this, he had this band that he was playing with at the time where, you know, he was first beginning to use his fiddle right. In, in a way like, like that. And, you know, just get outta the way and let him do what he wants to do. When he came out, sadly, he went to Princeton instead of Columbia <laugh> <laugh>. You know, once you say, Dan, do what you like to do, well, he talks about this, there's a, there's a webpage, sort of dedication to Paul Lansky on the occasion of his retirement, where Dan tells a story about how Paul said, you know, you should do more of that fiddle stuff. And Dan said, oh, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2172.94" data-end_ts="2173.1" title="2172.94" id=c_"2172.94">__well__</span>, or, or when, when listening to Jeff Snyder's, interview you did last week, where, where I said, Jeff, you know, what happened to all these musical instruments? Yeah. I remember that conversation too. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2182.32" data-end_ts="2182.54" title="2182.32" id=c_"2182.32">__Oh__</span>, be, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>Yeah. All of a sudden they go, wow, I can do that. You know? <span style="color:red" data-ts="2186.18" data-end_ts="2186.3" title="2186.18" id=c_"2186.18">__Yeah__</span>. There are a lot of cases where students come out of programs where, you know, they've been channeled into doing the proper music. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2193.34" data-end_ts="2193.54" title="2193.34" id=c_"2193.34">__Right__</span>. And they don't afterwards. But if you realize these are people who wanna do stuff that they want to do, of course they're gonna continue to do it <laugh> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2202.18" data-end_ts="2202.46" title="2202.18" id=c_"2202.18">__because__</span> Right. That's, that's who they are. So. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and it seems like the world is actually a little more open to that as well. I mean, it wasn't all that long ago that a person like Jeff would've made a thing like the Manta and driven around to the five companies that were making, audio materials, and they would've all rejected him, and then he would've gone off to work at an automotive factory somewhere, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>Or aerospace or <laugh> or 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Aerospace. Right. And, in fact, the world has kind of changed to where sort of like a guy with this idiosyncratic way of doing things is embraced by the community in some useful way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I think, you know, it, you know, it manifests in all kinds of ways. I think of, you know, Michael Kling <span style="color:red" data-ts="2251.41" data-end_ts="2251.7" title="2251.41" id=c_"2251.41">__bile__</span> in the Spear program, you know, I mean, yeah. He came into my office and said, I got an idea to do a program. You described <span style="color:red" data-ts="2258.26" data-end_ts="2258.34" title="2258.26" id=c_"2258.26">__it__</span>. And I said, oh, well, you know, go ahead and knock yourself out. Kid <laugh>, you know, a year later out comes this incredible sort of interface, you know? Right. Sam <span style="color:red" data-ts="2265.96" data-end_ts="2266.18" title="2265.96" id=c_"2265.96">__plu__</span>, any I, any of these people I can name, you know, they, you give them enough rope and, you know, they'll do their thing <laugh>. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, let's talk about, let's talk about your, some of your work, because there's one, there's one, yeah. Watch out. There's actually one thing that, you've shared with me that I find really interesting, which is, growing fascination with the idea of interactive books or book, like things I shouldn't call 'em books, because first of all, they're implemented as code Yay. Code. But, but secondly, they, they are sort of like complete in their thoughtfulness in, in that there's not a lot of sort of the standard, framework of a computer program. You, you've developed things that sort of take over the environment and present themselves in a way that's very unique. The first one I saw was some years back, you created one, I don't even remember what you developed it in, but it was, it would run on a Macintosh, I think, only maybe. Does that sound right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>Yeah. I'm trying to, I most of 'em ran on Windows, but the Windows versions were kind of flaky. I, the first one, first one I did, was called, my music book was Back 2001, I think. Okay. And that I used a, a language called Jason that Phil Burke wrote, because it ran on both windows. It was a Java based language Okay. Ran on Windows and Macintosh's. Right, right. And the second one I did entirely in Max s <span style="color:red" data-ts="2365.46" data-end_ts="2365.58" title="2365.46" id=c_"2365.46">__p__</span>, that was, my Book of dreams. That may be the one that you're thinking. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2368.42" data-end_ts="2368.5" title="2368.42" id=c_"2368.42">__the__</span>, that's the one I'm thinking of. That's the first one that I, that I saw, I think. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>Right. And again, I did it, at the time, I'm not sure it still runs because I have not updated the RT Smic Tilda object for Windows <laugh>. But at the time it ran on both Mac and Windows, because Mac's MSP was running on both. Right, right. And that was a very easy way to make the interface, the latest one I did. It's not out yet. In fact, you're one of the beta testers. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I know. Well, thank you, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>By the way. It's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2397.42" data-end_ts="2397.54" title="2397.42" id=c_"2397.42">__a__</span>, it's a book of memories. You know, as I get older, I discover how precious our memories are. So essentially it's just like, you know, it's, it's probably, it's funny, I thought it was boring for a lot of other people, but people who've read it said, well, it really made me think about my own life. You know, it's like memories of playing with my sister at Christmas time when we were younger and stuff like that. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="2417.82" data-end_ts="2417.94" title="2417.82" id=c_"2417.82">__I__</span> did that. That was, it's funny because the platforms for creating an interactive book are now, you know, in 2001, not much existed, but now this is developed primarily for iPads and, Kindle fires. Right. You know, two popular reading devices, it'll run on other platforms, but that's really, you know, what the architecture is supposed to be. Right. And the, the fun part of the code was I had to port the code that I was using for the audio engine, this RTC mix language. Yeah. Both Android and, iOS had <span style="color:red" data-ts="2450.06" data-end_ts="2450.1" title="2450.06" id=c_"2450.06">__a__</span> lot of help with Damon Holborn. He's, one of my grad students just finished his degree. Yeah. The idea was to create this, thing that tied together, you know, obviously I like to talk to Darwin here We are. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2463.46" data-end_ts="2463.66" title="2463.46" id=c_"2463.46">__do__</span> too. Why do you think I'd do a podcast? Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>I know. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Really. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2466.38" data-end_ts="2466.66" title="2466.38" id=c_"2466.38">__Because__</span> otherwise I'm sitting up in the mountains here kinda looking out the window saying, why won't anyone talk to me <span style="color:red" data-ts="2471.46" data-end_ts="2471.7" title="2471.46" id=c_"2471.46">__doing__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2471.7" data-end_ts="2471.86" title="2471.7" id=c_"2471.7">__this__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b><laugh>? Yeah. I know that feeling the wilds of New Jersey. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, that's right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>Anyhow. But it, it's funny because the, the idea of the books actually grew out of something even earlier, and it was a recognition of technology providing an opportunity for presenting music. In a way. It was, you know, I hate to bash on this, but outside the concert context, you know, because to me that was, that was just a default position. And it, you know, I started questioning, is this the best way to do the kind of music that I wanna do and communicate the kind of things I wanna communicate? And I started creating these little applications that would run the first one. We had Next Machines back in the late 1980s, early 1990s, and that was all the rage in the computer music research community. Right. And the cool thing about Next Machines is they had a Motorola 65 K D S P chip separate from the processor. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>Right. And David Jaffe had written this program called The Music Kit, which allowed you to design algorithms that would run just on that processor and to learn the music kit. I wrote this little ambient music application that I called luing and, wrote it entirely in the music kit so that basically I could run it while I was doing other stuff on the main cpu, like working on code or something. I'd have this thing running in the background, and I put it out, this is before the web and, you know, http and browsers and everything. I put it up on an, an FTP site at Purdue University, and within two weeks I was getting emails from people all over the world who downloaded and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2572.84" data-end_ts="2573.13" title="2572.84" id=c_"2572.84">__were__</span>, were enjoying this program. And I thought, whoa, this is pretty cool. <laugh>. Yeah. I didn't have to dub cassettes or anything <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>So I, I began to explore the idea that you can create these little algorithmic pieces that unfold on a processor and essentially establish almost a one-to-one communication with say, an audience, if you want to call it that. You know, rather than having to put people in a hall and blast the sound, you know, and like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2602.45" data-end_ts="2602.65" title="2602.45" id=c_"2602.45">__oh__</span>, listen to me, I'm a composer, God. Right. You know, this was a way of creating these things, almost like, and this is, this is the key that led to the books, almost like the relationship that an author has with you when you read a novel. Right. It's like you established this communication with this creative entity through the medium of the novel. And I found that to be, you know, very compelling. You know, it's a very direct and, very <span style="color:red" data-ts="2627.03" data-end_ts="2627.25" title="2627.03" id=c_"2627.03">__en__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2627.51" data-end_ts="2627.73" title="2627.51" id=c_"2627.51">__Oh__</span>, engaging, God, I use that word too much. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>You know, you know what I mean? It's, yeah. It fits, right. Yeah. It's, it's a strong relationship. And I thought, dang, you know, I wonder if I could actually create that same intense one-on-one experience by tying everything together in a book. I thought, well, I'm not a very good author, and I'm, I am good at making weird sounds. So what I'll do is make a book with a soundtrack, <laugh>. Right. Right. And the, the key, and this is where the algorithmic stuff, you know, the stuff that I'd learned by creating these little unfolding algorithmic processes, is that you need to be able to accommodate different reading speeds and different reading things. If you're gonna tie the music into the text, you have to be able to have some kind of responsibility otherwise, you know, just play a CD in the background. Right, right. I wanted something that would be completely integrated between what you were reading and what you were hearing. And then I expanded it with the Book of Dreams to also some graphics. And then the, the current one has little videos that are embedded and things like that. And it became almost, again, this is that opportunity I talk about with technology, a way of creating a new type of artistic expression by bringing together these strands of technological capability, you know, so that all of a sudden you've got something that's essentially different. I think, you know. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Now, one of the things I would ask, I, so looking both at Book Dreams and, and the the new thing, I'm first of all struck by how it's very much, you've, you've developed sort of a platform to have a very personal voice. And I think that's cool, because when I read it while I'm listening to the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2729.84" data-end_ts="2730.06" title="2729.84" id=c_"2729.84">__Lu__</span>, the Luing and Little Side Note, you actually are a collaborator with me on practically every gig that I do. Cause I have, I have eye looch on my iPhone, and whenever I find myself kinda like, twisted up on the modular, I'll just like kick off <span style="color:red" data-ts="2749.12" data-end_ts="2749.34" title="2749.12" id=c_"2749.12">__ILO__</span> to kind of fill in a blank until I can 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>Seriously, oh, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's, I know that I do that all the time. I mean, literally every 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>Gig <span style="color:red" data-ts="2756.54" data-end_ts="2756.7" title="2756.54" id=c_"2756.54">__you__</span> like thousands of billions of dollars in royalties, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2759.04" data-end_ts="2759.26" title="2759.04" id=c_"2759.04">__dog__</span>. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You come get it, because if you can find it, I'm willing to, I'm willing to let you have as much as you can find. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>Oh, wow. That makes me feel pretty good. I didn't realize, realize that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. But, one of the things that I'm curious about, you know, is you've made this personal thing, and to a certain extent, it seems like a wonderful way to take these memories, make them concrete in a way that's gonna allow people to enjoy and appreciate them in the future. However, unlike an actual book, you're putting this on, you're putting this together with technologies that who knows how long they're gonna last. I mean, with a book, unless all of a sudden somebody decides that we have to change the wavelength of light, it's a technology that's gonna work until the pages crumble. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>Mm. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But that's not the case with computing devices where we're in such a rush to get the new version of whatever, that an awful lot of stuff gets left behind. Yeah. And I know just for myself, I've got the detritus of, of the last 30 years of creativity sitting on floppy discs and jazz drives, and, you know, some of it luckily made it to cdr, which I can still at least harvest from. But, how do you, how do you imagine this work that you're doing, being able to sort of live beyond the cratering of the next of the current technology, and still being valid for the people who are gonna want to experience this work? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>You know, I'm gonna, I'm gonna pull a Richard Rty thing here. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2862.88" data-end_ts="2863.1" title="2862.88" id=c_"2862.88">__Oh__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2863.1" data-end_ts="2863.26" title="2863.1" id=c_"2863.1">__oh__</span>. And just say, just say, I ignore that question. <laugh> <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Awesome. That's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>An option. You know, I mean, it's, yeah. It's funny because, I think it was, Paul used to say this, Paul Lansky, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2877.56" data-end_ts="2877.78" title="2877.56" id=c_"2877.56">__you__</span> say, if you start writing for the ages or worrying about the future of something, it's the kiss of death, right. For artistic work, you know? And to a certain extent, I, I just kind of buy into that, you know, if I'm fortunate enough that I can do something that reaches a few other people, now I'm a happy guy. You know, I'm, I'm kind of, the other thing Paul said is you always write for yourself. And basically, again, academia gives me that freedom, right? I can sit at home and I can put together these things. And a lot of times I sit there and go, huh, that was pretty good, Brad <laugh>, <laugh>. You know, the, the depressing part is then I go, well, you're the only person who's probably gonna listen <span style="color:red" data-ts="2915.08" data-end_ts="2915.3" title="2915.08" id=c_"2915.08">__to__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>This. Right? Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>That's the flip side of it. But, I think, you know, if you, if you try to, first of all, you'll, you'll overlook the possibilities that are presented by contemporary technology. If you say, well, I'm only gonna do things that will be able to somehow migrate to the future. And secondly, that's a little presumptuous too, you know? I mean, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it is, but I mean, I'm not 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2943.02" data-end_ts="2943.22" title="2943.02" id=c_"2943.02">__No__</span>, no, I know what you mean. I know what you mean. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2944.18" data-end_ts="2944.3" title="2944.18" id=c_"2944.18">__I__</span> mean, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm not necessarily saying that some, some days someone's gonna treat you like, you know, George Washington. Yeah, yeah. But, you know, I think, one of the things, especially when it comes to very personal stories and personal expressions, there's this sense that, you know, your family will find it valuable. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>In the future. And, so, you know, I always, I always, every time I do one of these podcasts, I come out of it with a little bit of personal growth, and you've just given me the opportunity to have that experience by saying, you know, shut the fuck up and do something. Right, <laugh>. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that really is, that really is kind of the crux of what you're saying, which is if you spend all your time worrying, you never get anything done. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>Yeah, yeah. Exactly. Right. Exactly right. I think, I think also, you know, I mean, there, there's a certain sense that, you know, there is a, there is a growing body of stuff that at some point people are gonna wanna be able to resurrect. And that's, you know, maybe I'm a techno utopian here, but I do believe in the future virtue of simulation. And, you know, it's funny, you see this happening now. Do you know what I've, I discovered, it was about a year ago, when I was a kid, I was addicted to this game called Tempest. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3025.6" data-end_ts="3025.82" title="3025.6" id=c_"3025.6">__It__</span> ran on Atari machines, right? Yep. There's a website you can go to, and now it runs in your browser, <laugh>. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that's true. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3033.61" data-end_ts="3033.9" title="3033.61" id=c_"3033.61">__That__</span>, and for some things that seems to be, you know, it, it has, I think a lot of it has to do with how engaged people with like the leatherman, strapped to their belt, find it <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>Yeah, yeah, yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That's So temp still draw them in. Unfortunately, my, my copy of Lori Anderson's Puppet Hotel, which runs on some ancient version of director Oh, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3059.14" data-end_ts="3059.3" title="3059.14" id=c_"3059.14">__right__</span>. Doesn't seem to have engaged the geeks in the same way, and Yeah, yeah, yeah. That sits for <span style="color:red" data-ts="3064.66" data-end_ts="3064.94" title="3064.66" id=c_"3064.66">__Lauren__</span> on my, on my thing, begging me to find a way to make it run, you know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>Give it time. Give it time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Give it time. Yeah. Eventually, yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>Pretty soon, we'll all have quantum computers in the cloud that'll run anything and everything. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's true. And maybe if I can somehow compel someone to believe that Tempest ran under Adobe director <span style="color:red" data-ts="3083.52" data-end_ts="3083.74" title="3083.52" id=c_"3083.52">__or__</span> macro <span style="color:red" data-ts="3083.9" data-end_ts="3084.18" title="3083.9" id=c_"3083.9">__media__</span> director, that would, that would really come to 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>My aid, or you just might find at some point that it just simply runs, you know? Yeah. Well, right. Simulation something go, Hey, wow, this stuff now works, you know? Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, actually there are people that are doing simulations of like, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3099.6" data-end_ts="3099.82" title="3099.6" id=c_"3099.6">__Mac__</span> OS eight, and so conceivably Yeah. You know, I could rumble back through that thread of goodies and, and work it, work it out that way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>Yeah. Yeah. I, it's funny, the, the, the coding of the, of the books, and especially the recent books, I saw something, poor David Byrne, he'd created this really wonderful thing. I think it was using, oh gosh, what? I can't remember what program he was using. It was one of those early kind of presentation, you know, sort of max script <span style="color:red" data-ts="3133.85" data-end_ts="3134.14" title="3133.85" id=c_"3133.85">__like__</span> programs. Right. And it was just, it was just, you know, he had, he had just a couple of videos that he'd made of the screen. It was just hysterical. The problem is that he was relying on the maximum CPU U speed. Oh. So he was just, yeah. Basically the code was just like, do everything you can as fast as you can. Yeah. And 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, now it's just, I blink <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>Yeah, yeah. It's just like, oh, it's over. You know? So it's funny because dealing with different types of things like tablets versus desktops versus laptops versus iPhones, you know, they all have radically different computing capabilities, and you actually embed in the code, timing information, stuff like that. So theoretically, if there's a simulation, it should run. Okay. Right. I, that's a little techno geeky. I think, again, the, the basic point is you do what you think you can do best at the moment. Right. And, you know, if, if you want to get all kind of writing for the future, writing for the ages about it, that's probably the best stance to adopt. You know, when Bach was, you know, using, equal temperament, you know, said, well, this is really cool and I'm gonna write the best stuff I can for it. Right. And all of a sudden, well, yeah, maybe we ought check out this, the sequel tournaments. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>Yeah. Here we are, comparing ourselves to Bach, Darwin I don't think so. Right. Yeah. But yeah, the deeper thing is just, you know, here's this stuff. What are you gonna do with it? Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's great advice. And, and, as always, you provide a thoughtful alternative to me and my overly emotional wrap up of my life. <laugh> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3228.84" data-end_ts="3229.06" title="3228.84" id=c_"3228.84">__go__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>Come on. I can get way more emotional than you read the book. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I, yeah. Okay. <laugh>, now I'm scared to, she's just gonna just like, maybe it's a book of chiding. Maybe that's the next one you <span style="color:red" data-ts="3241.34" data-end_ts="3241.5" title="3241.34" id=c_"3241.34">__need__</span> to do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>Oh, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3241.9" data-end_ts="3241.94" title="3241.9" id=c_"3241.9">__I__</span> don't think so. Book 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Of Chiding <laugh>. Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>Book of chiding. Right, right, right. Throw some sticks and then read what chi you get today. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I know that you've, you've got a schedule, to, to meet. And I, and we're running on an hour here already. It's amazing how this time flies. Oh, yeah. There's about 10,000 other things I wanted to talk to you about. So maybe we'll pick it up on, on a follow <span style="color:red" data-ts="3270.28" data-end_ts="3270.5" title="3270.28" id=c_"3270.28">__up__</span>, podcast at some point. In the near future. But love to, I wanna thank you so much for spending the time and kind of, kind of like driving all over the, all over the landscape here with me. It's a lot of fun. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>Oh man. Yeah. I mean, this is, this is, like I said, I feel like I've got a good job today, <laugh>. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I tell you. Me too. Well, thanks a lot and I will talk to you again soon. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brad: </b>Okay. Take care. Bye bye-Bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm on vacation right now, so I'm not gonna be very responsive an email, but I just wanna thank everyone for listening in and, supporting the podcast. As always, if you have any questions or comments, reach out to me. Ddg cycling <span style="color:red" data-ts="3316.5" data-end_ts="3316.78" title="3316.5" id=c_"3316.5">__70__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3316.78" data-end_ts="3317.58" title="3316.78" id=c_"3316.78">__four.com__</span>. Always happy to hear from listeners if you have any suggestions or most particularly if you'd like to be interviewed, reach out. I got some open spots coming up, so I'd love to get some interesting, people with some new perspectives on the whole art, music, and technology thing. Thanks a lot and have a great week.
