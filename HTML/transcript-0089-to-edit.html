<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today I'm going to be introducing you to a friend of mine, Ben Griswold who has, who's very different from some of the people that we've interviewed recently. It seems like recently we've done a lot of musicians or software, hardware developers, and, that's really interesting to talk to. But, I want this to be about a broader set of media and media approaches. And Ben is, has a really interesting sort of position in the world. I got to know him, first of all as an instructor at the University of Denver, where he taught probably the most interesting class I ever took, which was one about the use of senses and the art, specifically eyeball things like smell, which was really weird and touch, which was really weird for my Midwestern sensibilities to deal with. But, it was, that was a really great introduction. And, beyond that though, he was in, he's involved with, with exhibit design at museums, and as a result, he and I have gotten a chance to certainly talk about a lot of these things over the years. It's been really interesting to learn more about that process. And so I was anxious to talk to Ben, for the podcast. With that, I'll introduce you to him. Hi, Ben. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben Griswold: </b>I'm great. Thanks for having me, Darwin 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, thanks a lot for, putting yourself up for this. This is really great. Why don't we start off by having you describe what it is that you do? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Sure. Well, so I am an exhibit designer and I work, really exclusively in museum environments. And I'm a contract designer, so I don't, I'm not an employee of any one museum. I contract out to various museums and, really am responsible in my role for, layout of an exhibition, working with, usually with a staff of curators and educators and preparators to, develop the character and tone, oftentimes the storyline or narrative of an exhibition. And really, to, to, to think about the, the visitor experience from the perspective of how someone, navigates a gallery environment and an exhibition environment so that they can have a meaningful experience, within that environment. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>That's the, that's the shorthand, I guess, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. But I think that's a, that's a great way of framing it because it gives us an idea of the kind of what you have to be thinking about when you're putting this together. Right now. One of the first shows that I saw you do was a show that would be very close to the hardest of the listeners, if they would, would have, have had a chance to see it. And it was a show called Blink, which was a show that was modern, basically modern media artwork presented in a museum setting. And I'd never really seen, I, I joke with people sometimes that the media art is the stuff that they put in the mobile home extension, you know, <laugh>, and you can't even hear it because the air conditioner is worrying real loud, you know? And in, in this case, it got a, it was the central draw of the museum, and it was a fabulous exhibit. How, first of all, had you worked with, with, with media art prior to that? In, in, at that level? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Not at that level. I had worked on exhibitions, that had video components. But really that was the extent of what I had done, previous to this. This was, and, and the exhibition Blink was at the Denver Art Museum, and it was, it was really, I think, a hugely ambitious, exhibition for them. And really for me, it was, it was a, <span style="color:red" data-ts="245.245" data-end_ts="245.365" title="245.245" id=c_"245.245">__a__</span>, a great step forward. It was the first time that I had a chance to work with the Denver Art Museum. Prior to that, I had done smaller exhibitions at, at smaller venues. But it was also a chance for, for the Denver Art Museum to showcase some of the things that they had in their collection that they really rarely bring out and, and had never before shown as a, as a suite of, of artworks. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So, so a number of those works, I mean, for, for people who didn't get a chance to see it, and that'll be the majority of the listeners. It was a show that kind of combined a lot of the classic media artworks by people like NAMM Pike and The SCAs and many others, and, and did it in a way that really focused not only on the individual artists, but kind of the environment of that all these people were kind of working under, or at least that's the way it felt to 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Me. That's right. No, that's right. And I, and I think one of the, one of the things that was very interesting to me about it, although, it ended up not being something that, that the museum really wanted to push as a narrative, but I think for anybody who was, who was attuned to contemporary modern media based artwork, the show, I think really neatly bridged that transition from, analog <span style="color:red" data-ts="321.845" data-end_ts="322.085" title="321.845" id=c_"321.845">__based__</span> media to digital <span style="color:red" data-ts="322.805" data-end_ts="323.085" title="322.805" id=c_"322.805">__based__</span> media. Oh, right. And, and I, and that I think, was actually really significant because you got to see early experimental video pieces and lightworks side by side with, things that were like, for example, viveka's piece, you know, where there's really some significant programming and, some really interesting digital aspects. So for people who <span style="color:red" data-ts="345.145" data-end_ts="345.365" title="345.145" id=c_"345.145">__are__</span> interested in that kind of thing, I think it was, it was this sort of wonderful survey of work from the late seventies into, the current decade. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So I'm gonna want to come back to that a little, little bit more, because I think that there are a lot of things for media artists in general to consider when we talk to a person who had to put together a museum collection. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> for that. But before we do that, one of the things I like doing in my podcast is kind of explore people's backgrounds to find out how they became the artists that they've become. Right? Sure. And, I'm curious how a person finds themselves in the position of being a museum exhibit designer. So where, what, how did you come up and what, what moved you in that direction? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Well, my background is, in studio art and architecture, but I have to say that there's no, like, looking back on my path, I, I think it, it makes sense the sort of steps that I took to get where I am, but I have to describe that as sort of like a hermit crab, walking backward, <laugh>. It's <laugh>. I, I got to where I wanted to go, but it wasn't by looking, looking at a point and, and striking a, a, a line to that, to that destination. It was really sort of, if anything, kind of bumbling my way along and, and maybe even looking at what I had done previously and trying to figure out, trying to sort of, vector off of, of earlier, earlier experiences. I, for a few years worked as a potter's apprentice for a couple different potters and had done ceramics. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>And, at some point became interested enough in, in studio art and ceramics that I, I felt like I really needed to go to a good art school and, and get a good arts education. So, I had been living in Alaska for, a few years, working for a potter and doing ceramics on my own. I set out for the East Coast and got ABFA in ceramics and sculpture, in upstate New York at a school called Alfred University, which if anybody knows anything about ceramics, that's actually considered one of the best, if not the best school for studio ceramics in the country. Uhhuh <affirmative>. I, so I finished ABFA there, ended up in Chicago working at the Art Institute of Chicago. And when I was in Chicago, my work had already started to take a turn toward, less functional work, although I was still interested in, in function, but it was, I, I became less interested in pottery and the vessel, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="505.125" data-end_ts="505.325" title="505.125" id=c_"505.125">__were__</span> interested in architectural ceramics and being in the environment of the sort of incredible urban environment of Chicago with, you know, that sort of living architectural museum of the city. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Right. I really became turned on to, architectural form and, you know, possibilities, sculptural possibilities, kind of rooted in architecture. And from there, it really wasn't a, a, a long step to, well, maybe if I wanna kind of retain this aspect of function, but I'm interested in, in something a little bit maybe differently scaled and, and differently, directed that architecture might be the thing. So I took a turn in my, arc and got a master's degree in architecture, which was a three year program. And I will say that within the first year of being out of school and working in an architecture office, I knew I had made a mistake, <laugh>, it was so painfully obvious to me that, I was not cut out to be an architect. That, and, and I, and don't get me wrong, the education was fantastic. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>I mean, I, what I learned in architecture school was immensely valuable, and it's things that I still draw on to this day. But I, you know, I was like nine months into my first job, and I was drawing, like counting parking spaces for, a huge project in the tech center south of Denver, and I was drawing bathroom layouts and doing code analysis, and I, I just thought, this is not what I, what I wanna do. Right. And I, I actually, I, sometime I wanna do a, I wanna have a gallery show of photographs that I took at job sites, <laugh>, when I was working, because what I found that I was doing, when I would go to a job site, and as the architect, you know, you, you show up to do what's called construction administration, you make sure the contractor is building according to your design, et cetera. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>All right? And I would take these photographs that were entirely aesthetically based. I wasn't, I wasn't documenting what was going on on the job site as I really should have been. What I was doing was, I would see, you know, anyone who's, who's seen a building under construction can recognize that there's a certain kind of harsh beauty to seeing, like the bones of a, of a building, the structure and, and the things that ultimately get hidden when a building is finished. And those were the things that I just thought were, were beautiful. And I was taking photographs, surely based on my notion of what, what beauty was, and that, that, if anything else, <laugh> wasn't giving me the clue that I was in the wrong field. Right. That, that probably was it. Sure. Within a year or so, I was thinking, I've gotta find some way to get back to what I was doing in an arts environment, and I don't know if that's gonna pay, but I gotta, I, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="673.605" data-end_ts="673.725" title="673.605" id=c_"673.605">__need__</span> somehow, I need to bridge what I was doing before with, with this architecture thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>And had become acquainted with Adam Lerner, who <span style="color:red" data-ts="682.825" data-end_ts="683.045" title="682.825" id=c_"682.825">__was__</span> at the, at the time, he was, first he was a, an educator at the Denver Art Museum. Then he was the director for a couple of years of something called the Laboratory of Arts and Ideas at Belmar in Lakewood. Okay. Colorado, just outside of Denver. Right. And currently he's the, the director of the museum Contemporary Art. Okay. And he and I had a conversation at a, it must have been some, some kind of party. And I was, I was telling him I woes, and he, he said, well, why don't you come down to where I'm working and let's work on some exhibitions. Huh. And, and what I realized in doing a couple projects with him was that was my bridge, that I could take what I understood about art, and I could take that sort of innate interest and passion for the aesthetics of experience and combine that with the training that I had had in architecture to work on really a, a very different kind of experience. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>So rather than, than detailing buildings, I could focus on experience. Right. I was still dealing with, with a lot of the, the functional aspects of that. You know, with within any, any museum environment, you have to deal with ADA issues, so American with Disabilities Act issues. So, accessibility is a, is a key thing. You always have to deal with egress and circulation. Those are things that, that I knew really a second nature after, you know, having to study those things and applied them exhaustively in architecture. But I was also able to really think about, in a kind of lyrical or poetic way, things like sight lines and really thinking about the body in space in a way that I had never done in architecture. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>And, and that became the, I think the thing that, that I began to recognize as, oh, maybe this is actually, you know, in some way it's a medium. I mean, I, I think there's an art to it. It's art with a small a Right. But I think, I think that there is an art to, to really thinking about a kind of focused experience in a gallery environment that is, and, and this doesn't just pertain to art exhibits, I think it pertains to any kind of exhibition. It's a, it's a focused experience that happens in space and time where you are both trying to educate to some degree and provide opportunities for, meaningful experiences. Whether those are, experiences with art, experiences with history, experience with science and scientific ideas. I think it comes through in all of those. But the, the sort of forces that one has to orchestrate and harness, to make that successful, I find really compelling. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, it's interesting to kind of consider your background <span style="color:red" data-ts="855.835" data-end_ts="856.125" title="855.835" id=c_"855.835">__with__</span>, from both the standpoint of pottery and, and architecture. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, because when I've seen your work, and again, I'll go back to the blank thing. First of all, the concept of architecture is really there. You made it so that the experience of walking through the exhibit that sight lines would, would reveal things in sort of an ordered way. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, there were places to rest. There were places to move. And I think most people can imagine an exhibit being very architectural in, in design. But what's also interesting, and this is the thing that maybe caught my attention in the Blink show, was the way that you took things that, init initially were meant to be the means of display. You know, the, the tools, the machinery that made the display work. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And you actually brought those out as, as part of the artwork. So the one I can think of specifically was the one with the, the eyeballs and a couple of TVs and stuff. I can't remember whose work that is, and I should, I'm gonna get hit in the head by somebody for forgetting this. But, it was very much, I mean, you could enjoy that as a piece of art without ever seeing the content on the screen, because the way it was presented was almost the way a potter would present work in a gallery. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Ah, right. Interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Uhhuh, I, I found that I, I found that very interesting. You did that in a number of cases. Cases where there was, you know, something other than just pure projection. Sure. You took the opportunity to bring forward the artifact of the device as well as the production of the, of the imagery or the sound. And I thought that that was really compelling. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Well, you know, I think I, I learned a lot in that exhibition. There's no question. I, I, I, there was a learning curve there that I had to scale really quickly. And there was a lot that I, I, I, I hadn't really considered before or hadn't been, asked to consider before, that I really had to contend with. And some of the things were, I think kind of extend on what you're describing, to, to think about what, what constitutes the artwork for some of these pieces. Mm-Hmm. And, and in some cases, it's not just a moving image, <span style="color:red" data-ts="998.665" data-end_ts="998.885" title="998.665" id=c_"998.665">__the__</span>, the actual projection of the moving image, but it's all of the apparatus that creates that projection to consider that as, as, as sort of a, a, a whole, I think especially in an environment where we could have really worked to hide some of that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Right. But why <laugh>? Yeah. Well, what's, what's, what's the point of, of disguising that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1026.245" data-end_ts="1026.485" title="1026.245" id=c_"1026.245">__when__</span>, especially in, in, you know, as I had said previously, the, the sort of amazing part to me of this exhibition was constituted of works that spanned, you know, 40 Right. 40 years of digital, or not digital, but 40 years of, of new media, new work. Yeah. Yeah. So, I, I think one of the things that was kind of delightful was to see some of the older things and, and to see, see them, being delivered on technology that we now consider outmoded, you know? Right. Like the mune pipe piece, there's a laser disc player, <laugh>, I know <laugh>. And the museum works really hard to make sure that that laser disc player doesn't break down because it's, it's, it's an important part of that piece. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I, you know, there were a number of things there that used some, some pretty ancient technologies. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1079.305" data-end_ts="1079.525" title="1079.305" id=c_"1079.305">__You__</span> had the laser disc there, the, the one, the piece that was in the room, where it's like color displays on CRT monitors. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Yes. That was Bjorn Mels. Ah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>And, that piece actually is, I, I would just let your listeners know that piece is viewable on YouTube. It's called Still Men Out There. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And it was, it was pretty incredible in, it's in, you know, at location, that's for sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Well, people left in tears. Yeah. And, and just to describe it really quickly for people, Bjorn <span style="color:red" data-ts="1111.765" data-end_ts="1111.965" title="1111.765" id=c_"1111.765">__Mel__</span>, who's, I think he probably has, he's, he's got name recognition at this point. He's done a lot of really interesting pieces. But with this piece, he took, audio clips from Hollywood war films, a bunch of Hollywood war films, and he edited them together. So he created a narrative of a young man becoming draft age and being inducted into the army and going through that process of, of training, going to war, having the experience of war, and then coming home again, all stitched together in audio from a bunch of films. Right. And done in a way that it would be, it would be, I think, difficult to identify, particular films. I mean, it, you know, it was <span style="color:red" data-ts="1157.565" data-end_ts="1157.725" title="1157.565" id=c_"1157.565">__done__</span>, I think, really in a sophisticated way, but then he took that audio and he had these, arrays of, CRTs, laid on their back so that the, the, monitors were facing upward in these ring arrangements in a gallery. And those were then triggered by the audio, so that there was no image per se, but what you had was this light show that was synced to the audio in a way that was, I think it was more powerful emotionally for, for viewers visitors than if there had actually been, a conventional cinema image. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. It was, it was something. And, and it was one of those things where it gave you enough narrative to take you down a down a story path. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, but left enough for you to build your own imagery and your own <span style="color:red" data-ts="1213.325" data-end_ts="1213.615" title="1213.325" id=c_"1213.325">__tail__</span> in your head. And that's often a thing that, that's often a mechanism that produces really emotionally monstrous effect. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Sure. Well, and I think, you know, it's, it's interesting that I'll, I'll use podcasts as an example. The podcasts I think are coming maybe into their own post radio, and posts so many other medium, but, you know, early ra think about all the things that were, that were happening on early radio, right. Stories and things, because with just audio, you're, you're asking listeners to, to I imaginatively bridge a gap. Right. So they have to bring something to that in their own mind, and that actually makes for, I think, a, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1255.445" data-end_ts="1255.565" title="1255.445" id=c_"1255.445">__a__</span> potentially stronger, a more profound emotional, experience. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, I agree. So anyway, with that piece, you had a whole bunch of ancient technology. I mean, first of all, that wouldn't have worked the same with standard LCD screens. No. At 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1275.325" data-end_ts="1275.405" title="1275.325" id=c_"1275.325">__All__</span>. You 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Really at all have to go get big 21 inch monitors or something, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Yeah. They're, they're chunky 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. I'll bet. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1284.035" data-end_ts="1284.325" title="1284.035" id=c_"1284.035">__Well__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1284.325" data-end_ts="1284.405" title="1284.325" id=c_"1284.325">__you__</span> take up a lot of warehouse room too, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>That's right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Or, or a lot of dumpster room, depending on which way you went with it. But, how difficult is it for you to track down technology? Was it to <span style="color:red" data-ts="1297.925" data-end_ts="1298.125" title="1297.925" id=c_"1297.925">__take__</span> down technology in that case, but also to what extent do you think that some of the artifacts of technology become part of the artwork? So, like, one thing I, I think of in that regard, I saw some video pieces where the imagery, instead of being done on a video screen, was done with a slide projector. Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1319.145" data-end_ts="1319.365" title="1319.145" id=c_"1319.145">__And__</span>, and part of the piece to me very much was the chunk, chunk, chunk, chunk Oh, sure. Mechanism as these, the rotisserie slide projector things. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> would work their way around the cycle. You know, that to me was a very much, now at the time, I am sure the artist was like, oh, I wish I could get rid of that goddamn noise. Right. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>But it becomes, but now we find it charming 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>In a way. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1344.765" data-end_ts="1345.005" title="1344.765" id=c_"1344.765">__Well__</span>, charming. And, and it's, it's the rhythmic soundtrack. Sure. In a way to the, the piece rightt. You bet. How often do you run into situations where maybe unintended portions of a, of, of a piece were proved to be important parts of the piece? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Well, you know, that's an interesting question, and that gets to, a couple other issues. And one is conservation, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Of, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Of artwork. And the other is, the kind of rights that the owner of an artwork has in terms of how they can, they can adapt, can or can't legally adapt an artwork to say new technology. So, for example, you may have a, an art video that's on vhs, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>And you want to, port that over to ADVD just because you, it's easier, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's convenient. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>It's convenient, but it may actually be that the VHS tape is, is the artwork. Oh my. And so this presents really interesting problems and for, for a museum and, and for, museum is collecting institutions and then also for private collectors. So, you can't just without approval, you can't just take the video off of the VHS and put it on ADVD Right. And then say, throw the VHS away. Right. What a museum will do, and what we did in several instances for the blink show was we asked for approval to make what's called an exhibition coffee, because if you, you know, if you play <span style="color:red" data-ts="1445.605" data-end_ts="1445.765" title="1445.605" id=c_"1445.605">__the__</span>, that VHS over and over and over again, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. It's going to destroy itself. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>It'll destroy itself. Right. And so you could have one exhibition with it, and then you're done. So if you, if you can get approval, and it's usually not too difficult to do to make ADVD mm-Hmm. <affirmative> play that DVD for the run of the exhibition and then destroy it, but it gets to something else, which is that only recently has museum conservation begun to, to really scale the mountain of what it means to try and conserve media based artwork. Right. And the, the kind of incredible and horrifying challenges <laugh> of that, you know, if, if, if, say the, a museum buys an artwork by an artist and that artwork is delivered on a floppy disc in 1989, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>And then that goes into storage for 25 years, and then the museum thinks, oh, we'd like to display that work. You have to ask, well, okay, you still have the floppy disc, but do you have any means to, to access the information on that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1515.165" data-end_ts="1515.405" title="1515.165" id=c_"1515.165">__disc__</span> at this point? Right. Like, you have to maintain a whole bunch of <laugh> of other things in order to make that, that work viable. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, you're opening <span style="color:red" data-ts="1523.885" data-end_ts="1524.125" title="1523.885" id=c_"1523.885">__this__</span> doors to a whole bunch of stuff here that I'm, I really want to dive into because I think it's important for people to also consider with their own work, how they make it so that it can be sort of like <span style="color:red" data-ts="1535.245" data-end_ts="1535.485" title="1535.245" id=c_"1535.245">__<inaudible>__</span>. But I've heard like crazy stories about the conversa con conservation thing, where the mechanisms that museums have to sort of catalog and maintain artwork is not really conducive to media. So like the story I heard was, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>I may have told you this 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Story Yeah. Maybe the one about measuring the VHS tape. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Why don't, I'll let you tell. Hilarious. Why don't you tell it? Because it's a, it, it's a howler. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>So, and, and I, and I will say that this is, it, it's a true story, but also it's, I think it's indicative of past practices. Right. And, and I think that this is where museums now have really, when I said scaling <span style="color:red" data-ts="1579.165" data-end_ts="1579.405" title="1579.165" id=c_"1579.165">__them__</span> out, they, they're really very quickly moving past this. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1581.685" data-end_ts="1581.885" title="1581.685" id=c_"1581.685">__Sure__</span>. But it <span style="color:red" data-ts="1582.725" data-end_ts="1582.845" title="1582.725" id=c_"1582.725">__is__</span> true that in, you know, for for any collecting institution, you have objects in, in storage, and you have to periodically condition report them. You have to, you know, make sure that they are, still stable. And this is true of works on paper, paintings, sculpture, anything like that. So, a, a media work that, say a video on AVHS tape, that's in storage to condition report it. The story is that the, the museum would, you know, annually go through and, and make sure that this was in good shape. And the way they did that is they would take the tape out of the drawer, they would look at it, and then they would drop a ruler on it to make sure that it hadn't shrunk <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>And then they would the cassette <laugh>, and then they would make notes and put it back in the drawer without even ever looking at the, the, the tape or, you know, the, you know, what's happening to the, the actual recording. Right. Media inside the, inside, the cassette <laugh>. So yes, those things did happen for, for quite a long time. And it was, it was partly out of ignorance, and it was partly out of convention. Right. Right. Sure. This is what you did for a painting. You, you inspect the surface. Right. You would check it dimensionally to see if the stretcher bars had had changed, if the wood had shrunk or warped, if there was any damage. So why would you treat A-A-V-H-S cassette tape any differently? Right. So now, you know, people know <span style="color:red" data-ts="1669.765" data-end_ts="1669.965" title="1669.765" id=c_"1669.765">__that__</span> better because, you know, maybe that that hasn't shrunk in 20 years, but suddenly whatever, whatever was on that magnetized surface of the tape is, is 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's gone. Yeah. Yeah. Now, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1682.825" data-end_ts="1683.045" title="1682.825" id=c_"1682.825">__ha__</span> have you heard of instances maybe where, where works were lost because of that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Absolutely. Oh, really? Oh, yeah. No, that happens all the time. Sure. And, you know, I mean, that happens with film all the time, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Certainly. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Acetate film is just, it's disappearing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. In the music world, it's the same thing with magnetic tape. What you get is all the magnetic stuff flakes off of the tape surface. That's right. And you end up with nothing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>There was actually just a, a really interesting article written about, the British, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1712.235" data-end_ts="1712.525" title="1712.235" id=c_"1712.235">__well__</span>, I forget what it's called, but it's essentially their equivalent of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1715.085" data-end_ts="1715.205" title="1715.085" id=c_"1715.085">__a__</span> library of congress. Right. And they have incredible, incredible audio recordings, that document things like highly regional local accents. Oh, right. Yeah. Around around England, great Britain. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And that stuff is starting to just crumble. Right. And so they're losing this incredible, document of, of their own history, from a particular time, because it was all done on original, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Magnetic tape. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Yeah. So it's, and not only that, it's also, final records and things like that Oh, sure. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1749.585" data-end_ts="1750.005" title="1749.585" id=c_"1749.585">__Flying__</span> apart shellac. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Free vinyl, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1752.665" data-end_ts="1752.885" title="1752.665" id=c_"1752.665">__the__</span> shellac, the, oh man, 70 eights and things like that are not stable. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>In terms of this kind of thing. What would be your recommendation for a current artist who wants to be thoughtful about having their work be valuable for the future? What are the kind of steps you make? Or, or is that just one of the risks problems with new media artwork? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Well, I think it is inherent in new media artwork, and I, it's, and it's, boy, it's a challenge. I think part of it is, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1784.625" data-end_ts="1784.845" title="1784.625" id=c_"1784.625">__as__</span>, as I've, as I've said now, you know, museums are really trying to get ahead of the curve on this. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1790.725" data-end_ts="1790.925" title="1790.725" id=c_"1790.725">__Right__</span>? Right. And the field of, of conservation is really, I think, moving forward with leaps and bounds and, and really trying to address these things head on. So there are, there are people who are professionals who are devoting significant parts of their career to trying to, you know, figure this stuff out. And they publish white papers and, you know, they're, they're writing about this. There are symposia, all over the place now, to address, address these issues, these issues. So there's information that's available. I think if, if there are artists who are, are, working in, in technology and media, that, that maybe it's, it's a question of, of what the shelf life of that might be. And they wanna try and figure out how to, how to extend the longevity of that work. You know, I think a big part of it's just trying to have conversations with, with people who are, whose job it is, is, is to look out for, the, the, the best possible situation conditions for your, for your work. Right. And, and believe me, conservators love to have those conversations 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right now. The other, yeah. The other thing I would think would be, is kind of a constant wrestling issue. And this is specifically, or especially true in the case of museum exhibits. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, oftentimes the artists that whose work you're showing, they're not around to give you the okay for anything. Right. So what are the mechanisms that you have to go through to get clearance? I mean, I assume in some cases there are very well trodden paths, and in other cases it's like magical trying to find the person who can give the, okay. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Yeah. You know, in a lot of cases, even for, for, for deceased artists, there are estates that handle, questions about their work. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So, you know, if, if you can't ask the artist directly, because they're in the great hereafter, you can, you can contact their estate and, and their estate o oftentimes we'll have, establish some kind of protocol for, how to, how to display work, how to, how to handle issues of, you know, if, if you need to actually <span style="color:red" data-ts="1929.365" data-end_ts="1929.525" title="1929.365" id=c_"1929.365">__port__</span> something over to another, another format. Right. And, and we'll have guidelines or even, you know, we'll, we'll have some kind of restrictions on what you <span style="color:red" data-ts="1938.365" data-end_ts="1938.445" title="1938.365" id=c_"1938.365">__are__</span> able to do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>So yeah, that's, it's, it's a really interesting question. I will say too, you know, in, in, in blink there were things that, that we encountered, and this is getting back to away from conservation and more about display. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, there were works that where we got really, really, we were given very strict guidelines on how something could be displayed. So for example, a video projection that, had to be projected, using a projector of no fewer than X lumens, the image had to be a certain size on the wall. It had to be in an enclosed space that had certain, a certain footprint Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And the screen paint had to be painted out a certain, like, it was really very, very, very specific. And I think, I mean, you know, what it made me think of is, the, the sort of anecdotal thing about, van Halen touring and demanding bowls full of green m and ms. Like, or, or 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>No. Yeah. Or like, no, brown M and msms I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Think was <span style="color:red" data-ts="2015.215" data-end_ts="2015.565" title="2015.215" id=c_"2015.215">__right__</span>. Yeah. It was just like this thing which everyone laughs at. Like, that just seems so silly to have Right. That kind of a bizarre request. And you, so you see these, these guidelines for, you know, for displaying a, a video and you think, why are you, you know, why are you so uptight <laugh>? Right. And then you have to realize that, and, and I think you'll understand this, you know, digital and electronic media art had, had, has been until I think very recently been marginalized 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Absolutely. For, for most of its existence. Right. And so, you know, people I think got used to showing in really crappy kinds of venues, <laugh>, right. Where there was no kind of, of of tech support. There was no, like, you know, if you have to show a piece in a warehouse, you just kind of take the, the, the grit and grime of the warehouse with it. Yeah. But you, but you might actually imagine a better condition for your work. Sure. Or if you're, if you're like, say if you're touring, your work around the country or the world and, and you're, you know, you're having your work shown at different kinds of places. You may go to see your work installed somewhere and be horrified at, at, at the poor conditions that a place installed it. So you start making demands and, and restrictions. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>The green m and msms thing, by the way, I learned years later was actually something that was very well thought out by Van Halen, and it was this, that they had a really sophisticated stage show that involved pyrotechnics and scene changes and all kinds of things that if a venue didn't get it right, it could actually be dangerous to the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2119.525" data-end_ts="2119.685" title="2119.525" id=c_"2119.525">__land__</span>. Right. Okay. And people around it. And so their test was, if you can't fill a bowl with green m and ms Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you probably are not gonna get the pyrotechnics on the stage. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>So they could walk into the, they could walk into the, the back room and say, oh, yeah, okay, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. This isn't gonna work. Yeah. <laugh>, I'm gonna get my head blown off. Well, that's, that's some, some pretty interesting stuff. And, and I hadn't really thought about it that way, but yeah, it does seem like, especially, you know, I, I guess more so on the gallery side, maybe, maybe I've, I've felt like museums tend to be more, thoughtful about their approaches to display than sometimes galleries are. But a lot of times, galleries, you know, with video works, they'll put them on something that's like the equivalent of a, of the DVD player, your kids watching the car. I mean, it's like, everything about it is cheap. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and, does not present the work in, a way that's going to honor the artist's intentions. So that's, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>That's right. That's right. Yeah. Or, I mean, you could, you could have a piece that is, you know, you fully intend to be projected. Right. And you show up and it's on a, it's on a 24 inch monitor 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Stuff in the corner and, and the, and your audio is the crappy speaker on the back of the monitor. Right. It's, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So now you do, I, I keep on bringing back blank because it's, it's the most amazing media show I've seen, but you've done a number of other, other, show designs now since then. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Haven't, and my question is one, is a different spin on the media art thing, which is that I would say museum a a museum display or a museum installation at this point, oftentimes is just as much media art is not simply because that's come to be what audiences expect when they go to, into a museum. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Yeah. To varying degrees. And I, and I would say it's maybe less media art, and more, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, maybe we're talking art with a lower a again. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Well, I, I think it's oftentimes what, what museums call interpretive elements Okay. In, in a, in a gallery environment. So, explain that. Sure. So, it may be <span style="color:red" data-ts="2262.905" data-end_ts="2263.125" title="2262.905" id=c_"2262.905">__in__</span>, in an exhibition of, I'll just, I'll make something up. A a a, an exhibition that's a, a surveyor or retrospective of a painter, you may wanna have something that helps the audience understand, this particular painter's unique process of painting. So you might have, you might develop, some kind of interactive that visitors can engage that would allow them to kind of mimic that process. Right. And it, you know, it could be something that's like a, it could be a touch screen. It could be, I see. Right. Yeah. Something like that. So, those are, that's, that really falls under the rubric of interpretation 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Got 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>It. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2308.085" data-end_ts="2308.485" title="2308.085" id=c_"2308.085">__Within__</span>, within a museum. And I think that those things are, are really very important, to two, you know, enhancing or augmenting, an exhibition experience. And certainly with, with the kind of, technological developments that we've had in the last several years, there are, you know, the, the, the, the possibilities, for developing things like that, I think are really, endless at this point. Right. The problem is, and I don't mean to denigrate museums, but I have to call them out on this a little bit, is that that effect of feeling like they need to have something in there. And, and the prime example is, everybody wants an iPad, something on an iPad 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>In an exhibit for visitors. Right. And it starts off even before they know what the content is, they are sure of the content delivery system. Right. It's gotta be an iPad and it's gotta be, and what happens is, if it's not well thought through, what you end up with is a lot of iPads laying around in a gallery that, that people aren't using Yeah. Or engaging with. And so there's, what ends up happening is, or can happen is this big investment in, in equipment. Usually it's a big investment in equipment, a not big enough investment in, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>In the development, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>In content development. And also, and then also in, there's, there's, there's thing that lies in between those two, as you know, which is you can have a bunch of, of, of, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2412.025" data-end_ts="2412.245" title="2412.025" id=c_"2412.025">__of__</span> people who are really thoughtful about, story and experience, and, and whose job it is to develop those things. And you can have a, a closet full of iPads, but those people don't necessarily have the skills to program Right. That stuff onto there. And, and so often what falls in the cracks is, you know, bringing someone in or having someone on staff who, who can make that actually happen Right on, on the platform. Right. Desired platform. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Yeah. But it does seem odd that the platform would come before the content that would exist on it, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Sure. And, and, and that happens a couple different ways. I mean, if, if, if, say a museum recognizes that they need to have these things and they spend 10, $20,000 on equipment, they wanna use that equipment. Oh, sure. Of course. Right. Like it's, it's gonna, you know, so it's, it's, it becomes sort of a mandate. Like, we, we bought this. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>All of a sudden your iPads have influence. Right. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Yeah. I'll say that. A couple years ago I was, I was back in Chicago and I was at the, the Art Institute of Chicago, which is, I think, you know, one of the great museums. Yeah. It's amazing. And they had iPads all over the place. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and maybe even more incredible, they had these proprietary beautiful custom logoed cases. They were, they were these metal cases, these frames that, that with these kind of amazing lanyards that would attach the iPad to a bench or these, these stands. And it was all, everything had the, you know, it was branded and beautiful. And I saw probably 30 iPads over, you know, walking through several, several galleries. And I think one of them was in use by the scads of visitors. Everyone was looking at the artwork. Yeah. Right. Which is actually, in my opinion, that's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The point. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>I would rather have people looking at the artwork than having a mediated experience. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Absolutely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Yeah. However, and I wanna go off on a tangent just quickly, which is the iPhone and the ubiquity of, of smartphones in, in the museums. And, it has become something that museums have kind of had to, to, grudgingly accept that, people wanted snap photos of what they're looking at Uhhuh, and now they wanna snap selfies of themselves next to artworks. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2558.115" data-end_ts="2558.405" title="2558.115" id=c_"2558.115">__Geez__</span>, I have found this to be annoying. No kidding, personally, it, it, I find it annoying. And, and, and the, the, the extreme version of it that I've, I've seen in museums is when people will walk along a wall that has paintings, and they won't even break stride. They're basically just shooting a video down the wall, and I wonder if they'll ever look at that again. Right. But, but there's another aspect to this that I think is important that I, that I have to acknowledge and give credence to, which is that this is part of how we are living in our, in our current moment. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>And there's an aspect of this behavior that I think is a sort of personal curation. While I would rather sort of imagine that people would, would prefer to sit, and I'll use a painting as, as an example, again, sit in front of a painting for 5, 10, 15, 20 minutes and really enjoy the experience of that painting, that they will, would rather snap that photo and move on and snap more photos, I think is there's, there is, value to that in that they are, they are kind of curating their own experience Right. In, in a way through that, through that platform. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It, it strikes me that the, the picture taking and the selfie thing at an art museum is, it's not, it's not something that they expect even to ever go back and look at, but it almost replaces the concept of having like a set of check boxes next to the, the things. And somehow taking a picture of a thing is marking the checkbox that says, yep, I was there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Well, and that's not unlike, for example, bird watchers. Right. You know, they have their field guide to North American birds, and, a serious bird watcher will, you know, they're checking those things off, man. That's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>And so it's, so there's a related Yeah. There's a related activity there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2684.405" data-end_ts="2684.685" title="2684.405" id=c_"2684.405">__Yeah__</span>. Okay. Well, one more thing before we go, well, actually two things. One thing though, getting back to this idea of working with estates and stuff like that and, and talking about these, like the, the way that exhibits are built with like extra, tools, extra stuff. Mm-Hmm. The iPad thing, or like, I was at one thing at the art museum where it was like, I think it, they were showing pottery and then they had like a little thing where you could paint pottery or something like that. Uhhuh Sure. But to what extent, especially if you're doing an exhibit of a single artist Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> to what extent does anyone care what additional stuff the museum <span style="color:red" data-ts="2728.985" data-end_ts="2729.205" title="2728.985" id=c_"2728.985">__tax__</span> on? I mean, you know, it's, I I have to feel like one of the things that could really submarine an exhibit is if it's like clown day at the, you know, <laugh> Oh, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2743.575" data-end_ts="2743.925" title="2743.575" id=c_"2743.575">__right__</span>. At the exhibit. Or it's like, you know, everybody gets a free Monet hat today, or, or, you know, here's a, here's a digital, you can be your own Monet bit. And, to what extent does, who puts the brakes on stuff being foolish 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b><laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's a crazy way to ask it, but I think you know where I'm going. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>No, I think that's a good question. I will say this, I would, I would actually step back and take a slightly larger view for a moment and say that, museums as a a, a class of civic and cultural institutions are in a sense they're kind of living, breathing things. That is, they're kind of always undergoing a, some kind of change, right. And they're, and, and museums are trying to respond to, whatever particular cultural moment we're in. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, and particularly now museums are recognizing that they are having to struggle to stay relevant, that they have to actually be a little bit nimble and experimental in terms <span style="color:red" data-ts="2819.305" data-end_ts="2819.525" title="2819.305" id=c_"2819.305">__of__</span>, of what they are and how they are engaging a community or multiple communities. And so the silliness, it's a, it's a tough call because there are a lot of experiments that are happening and, and understand like in the last several years there's been this rise of this new kind of museum professional and and practice that has to do with evaluation. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>So museums are, are, are preoccupied with obsessed with evaluation. Everything they do, they want to, have some kind of, they would like it to be objective. And it's, it's, it can be tough to make it objective, but, but some kind of, of measure of was this successful? Right? Was is what we're doing, is it, is it not only reaching an audience, but is it building an audience? How is it working ultimately? And so the, there's an understanding that museums sort of broadly in, in, in the view of the public are a kind of elitist, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2885.105" data-end_ts="2885.325" title="2885.105" id=c_"2885.105">__the__</span> elitist institution. And they, they are, they're struggling to shed that, sense of elitism. And there's a recognition that in the sort of huge ecosystem of entertainment and diversion and cultural amenities, museums have a lot that they're up against, you know, people, they might rather go to a waterpark or a baseball game or hang out on their couch and play Xbox for hours. Right? Right. So how do you bring, how do you bring people in? How do you gauge people? And it's a struggle. And so, you know, museums in the 21st century, I think are, are in a really interesting place because, they are really trying to, figure out how to stay relevant and how to reinvent themselves and still be meaningful significant cultural centers. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, in <span style="color:red" data-ts="2938.805" data-end_ts="2938.885" title="2938.805" id=c_"2938.805">__the__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>And if that requires a Monet hat Yeah. On Thursday, well then there it is. But on your <span style="color:red" data-ts="2944.675" data-end_ts="2944.965" title="2944.675" id=c_"2944.675">__Moab__</span>. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So in, in your experience, either, you know, from your own perspective or from the perspective of the people that you work with at the museum, do you ever, as part of the evaluation, do you ever find yourself also thinking about how you're moving art forward or how you're, how you're affecting a specific artist's? Because when a person's work gets included in a collection at a museum, that's a significant bump up in their sort of like, artistic position. And then when they get a, a museum that, that does a solo retrospective or something, that's another huge bump. How do you, how is the evaluation of the artistic side rather than the commercial side of that 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b><laugh>? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Or is that another show? <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>That's, yeah, I mean that's, that's sort of outside of, of, of what I, of what I deal with. Certainly there's Okay. Those things are, I suppose they're taking into consideration some <span style="color:red" data-ts="3002.965" data-end_ts="3003.125" title="3002.965" id=c_"3002.965">__way__</span>. There's no question, but that, you know, for a living artist to have a museum show Yeah. Will, will burnish their credentials. Right. And then if you wanna get even more crass, a collector that has Oh sure. Works in their collection, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>They really want to see that happen. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Sure. But I don't think that those things go into any kind of evaluation. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="3023.595" data-end_ts="3024.085" title="3023.595" id=c_"3023.595">__Alright__</span>. We've burned through our time and then some See, you were worried about if we would have enough to talk about. I know. Yeah. And I feel like there's, we've come up with like three hours more that we could talk about, but nevertheless, before we go, I am hoping that our discussion maybe has gotten some people, especially somewhere younger and in school, in school kind of people to say, wow, this is a kind of an interesting, career path. The one that I hadn't thought of, but I would prefer to have a career that doesn't require me to move to Alaska, become a potter, <laugh>, learn pottery, give up pottery, uhhuh, take on architecture. Right. Realize architecture was a great big mistake. Before I get to my calling, <laugh>, what would you say is, what are the routes that now people could take to do the kind of work that you do? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Oh, well, so that's interesting. I think like a lot of other fields, museum practice has really become professionalized in the last several years. And so there have sprung up at colleges and universities all over museum studies programs. And, within many of those, there are exhibition design tracks. Okay. As well as, you know, conservation tracks. If there's something that is really, I think of interest of someone to someone and, and they think that they wanna go into working in, in museum environment, there are are a lot of, educational options, I think available <span style="color:red" data-ts="3115.545" data-end_ts="3115.765" title="3115.545" id=c_"3115.545">__to__</span> people. And certainly, you know, if, if someone is interested in combining an interest in, I don't, what's, what's the term really? I mean, digital media, new media, I've heard variable media. I don't really know what, what the, what the kind of go-to term is. But, you know, media <span style="color:red" data-ts="3129.655" data-end_ts="3130.005" title="3129.655" id=c_"3129.655">__based__</span> work with museums, I can tell you that conservation is a really interesting field. The other is I don't program, I don't know how to program, but it's not infrequent that I will be working on a project where we need to bring someone in who has some of those skills for some, some aspect of, of the project. So I think thinking about exhibit design or museum exhibits and, and how, how some of those interpretive elements can be developed and and done <span style="color:red" data-ts="3164.495" data-end_ts="3164.845" title="3164.495" id=c_"3164.495">__would__</span> is something that that is, there's a demand for that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Right. Yeah. It's interesting. It used to be that the idea of a museum technologists was sort of, you know, you'd hear of one or two of these people, but for the most part Sure. A lot of times they were more often connected to like these professional touring museums Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> than they were to art museums. And how that has over the last few years completely changed and there seems to be a lot of jobs now available in that kind of work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Sure. And again, you know, this is another area where I think museums are evolving. Right. Probably wasn't that long ago that they were all lumped under AV <laugh>. We need, we need an AV guy, AV guy, <laugh> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3205.375" data-end_ts="3205.725" title="3205.375" id=c_"3205.375">__being__</span> an AV guy, you know, and, and, and now it's, it's a recognition that, that, really they need, they need people with very special, sophisticated skillset sets Right. To do, to do really special sophisticated things inside the museum. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, Ben, I want to thank you so much for your time. It's, it's been, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Oh yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>My pleasure. It's <span style="color:red" data-ts="3225.845" data-end_ts="3225.885" title="3225.845" id=c_"3225.845">__a__</span> fantastic chat. I hope we'll get together soon because if nothing else, it's always cool to hang out with you. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Thanks Darwin I appreciate it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thanks. Bye 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Now. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3234.565" data-end_ts="3234.805" title="3234.565" id=c_"3234.565">__Alright__</span>, take care. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I was that for something different? I thought that was great and thanks. So thanks so much to Ben for spending the time. I know he is a really busy guy and the fact that he took all the time to tell us a little bit about how museum exhibit design happens, how, what are some of the thought processes that go into it? What are some of the things that you're constantly having to look for the influence of the iPad on exhibitions the whole bit. I think it was pretty amazing. So thanks to Ben, thanks to you for listening. Thanks for you to passing it along. I want to thank, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3271.435" data-end_ts="3271.725" title="3271.435" id=c_"3271.435">__yeah__</span>, like several hundred new Facebook friends this recently. I wanna thank y'all and finally make sure if you're available and you happen to be in the neighborhood of either Lincoln, Nebraska on August 1st or De Des Moines, Iowa on August 2nd, please stop by, and see us, myself and Mark Moser when we're playing in your town. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Again, August 1st, it's going to be at the Space Commons. I think that's how you would say it, in Lincoln. You can find out more by looking@nopoem.net. That's the name that we go under no poem. And, in Des Moines, we're gonna be at the Des Moines Social Club on Sunday. It's a kind of an early show. We're gonna open up at four 30 for questions, give you a chance to play with some of our gear. And then we're gonna perform at five 30 until six 30. So, and the thing in the, in Lincoln is at 7:00 PM Again, you can check it all out@nopoem.net. I hope if you're in the neighborhood out to see you. If I'm not in your neighborhood, reach out and, we'll see if we can't come to your neighborhood because we're always looking for a great chance to play around people that are interested in it. So thanks so much for listening. That's it for this week. I'll catch you next week with a really great, podcast as well. Bye.
