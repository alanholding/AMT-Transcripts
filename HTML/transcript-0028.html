      <i>So this week I am interviewing Jason Kramer He's the co-owner and the face of the business that control voltage really cool store in Portland that, that carries a lot of electronic music making products. I mean, it's one of
        the cool places because you can come in, try out a lot of modular systems, you Scot some more standard sets as well. <span style="color:red" data-ts="25.89" data-end_ts="26.23" title="25.89" id=c_"25.89">__Curious__</span>, some use products,
        really cool. We're meeting here in a store. So it's going to be a little echoey, but that's kind of cool too. It's a little bit before opening. So, Jason's given me a chance to interview him. Hey Jason, how's it going? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jason Kramer: </b>
      Oh, it's going great, man. Thanks
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>For putting this on. No, no problem. Happy Sunday morning. Very happy. I should have actually asked you where to go to get a coffee before we started, <span style="color:red" data-ts="52.32" data-end_ts="52.44" title="52.32"
          id=c_"52.32">__but__</span> I guess we'll have to work it out. I can put a pot on if you want. I think we'll be fine for the moment. Well this is quite a story you have. Can you give me a little bit of background on how you position
        yourself to open some <span style="color:red" data-ts="66.18" data-end_ts="66.33" title="66.18" id=c_"66.18">__food__</span>? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jason: </b>
      Well position myself though, is something like this. I think in general it was always an idea. I had, something that wanting to share the little gadgets that I was into with everyone from just buddies in high school and friends in
      college to nieces and nephews, to coworkers at jobs I had, but, you know, not finding a lot of the stuff that I'm looking for in the shops around. So also involved in various communities like the Monome online community was a big, big part of
      realizing that there was, a lot of little scenes out there just to be part of one was, was quite awesome. There's a lot of support in that kind of community. So, you know, just, I think getting fed up with trying to buy products online and
      taking them out of the box for the first time and getting to play with them and wanting to be able to play with them beforehand.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Right. Well, you're one of the few, Monome dealers in the world, I think, right. You're the one my dealer. Okay. It was, it was actually, it was actually really, pretty interesting to walk in and see some arcs on display as
        kind of hard to get hard, to even find those. So that's, that was really interesting. So before you started the story, you were pretty into this stuff and, and active in the online communities. That's cool. One of the things, so yesterday we
        did a little workshop here where we kind of did modulars plus, modulars plus max, which was a really well attended. There was I think, approaching 40 people that came into the shop, which was really cool. That sort of implies the fact that
        you've got a scene going here. How did that develop? Is it something you tapped into or is it something you feel like you were developing and how, how does that start? How, how does that, how do you get involved in something like that? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jason: </b>
      I think it's a little bit of everything. First off Portland is a really supportive town. It didn't take long for a few now really good friends, but acquaintances before the shop opened to find out about us before we even opened
      the door. And, we had a couple of people that are, I now consider some of my best friends that were knocking on the door when I had created paper of what were the windows. So when we did open, there was a lot of support in trying to get the
      word out, passing the message along. We don't really advertise besides, you know, giving out free stickers and doing a few cross promoted events. We subsist almost totally on word of mouth and letting people perform their music here. Whether
      that's, it is actually mostly locals, but some people that are in town from out of town or passing through on tour, or just passing through on vacation and get in touch that.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jason: </b>
      So we put on shows, we also consigned their music. We let people put their tapes and CDs and records and such on our media shelf and we sell it for them and we promote them that way. But I think mostly the, the scene is, is it's
      pretty spread out in Portland. There's a lot of different kinds of music going on and it's, it's a pretty amazing place for lots of different genres of music, for sure. Portland likes to be weird and since, and sample based and computer hybrid
      machine weirdness fits in really well with, I think the mentality in the city
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>That seems to make sense. I know yesterday talking to some of the people after the workshop, it was really interesting to find people that identified themselves as composers or as I'm, I'm a guitar player. That's also looking
        at, you know, doing something crazy and new, or I want to integrate, a lot of people talking about how they're primarily computer based, but moving more and more to hardware. And so it seems like you kind of tapped into something interesting
        and kind of important, for those people now one, so this afternoon I'm going to be playing a gig at this six, whatever. It's not a festival, it's just a performance </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jason: </b>
      Once or twice a year at CA.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Right. And, I noticed, or in talking with Tim, who's putting it on. He mentioned he was talking his way through the, and there are a lot of people that are going to be using modular or modular plus something else. Did you feel
        like there was already a pretty extensive community in, in town before you opened up your shop? Or do you think that you were influential on getting modular synth in the hands of people? Or was it just a, one of those scenarios where
        everything kind of converge? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jason: </b>
      It's definitely still in, in motion, you know, but there, there was a solid scene. A lot of people that didn't know there were other people, that's what I found out after we opened. But for sure, like when a friend introduced me
      to modular, we've introduced people to modular. And while I knew about modular since before friends introduced me and I got to put my hands on it, and then I got into it, other people too knew about it, and maybe they saw something on TV or on
      YouTube, or maybe they saw somebody perform at a, you know, a weird art exhibition or something like that. A lot of times it does come to the whole slippery slope mentality where people don't want to even put the, you know, the, they want to
      put the blinders on. They want to stay as far away. Cause they know if they get into it, it's, it's, it's going to drag in, you know, it's, it's too immediate and to, just makes your brain happy. It's strangely, satisfactory.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Well, it's, it is compelling. And, you know, during the workshop you were kind of playing around with things where the modular would control the computer and stuff like that. And it makes a lot of sense because there are
        things that happen that you feel more than intellectualize. And I think that that actually is one of the things that's sort of joyful about analog synth stuff is you have to kind of turn the novel a couple of times to understand how something
        feels and then you, and then you internalize it. And that becomes how you interact with, with the musical development rather than saying, well, I need a 2.5 second feed in right here says that's pretty interesting now, in your role here at
        control voltage, you obviously find yourself in the position of introducing people to analog systems and modular sense. What are, what do you find is the hardest thing to convince people of and what you find convinces people for you? You
        know, how do, how do people get sucked in when they get sucked in? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jason: </b>
      I like that you said, how does it convince them for me? Because a lot of times this stuff does rabbit ears, quote, unquote, sell itself. You know, we, we don't push anything on anybody. I never want to upsell. I never wanna, I
      never want anybody to leave here with something that they're not, they want to get into and want to take home and, you know, make music with their make sounds with. But we leave the devices set up for people to play with an experiment. So it's
      a very non committal sort of, it just promotes an exploratory experience so people can go around and they can have absolutely ask questions and I'm more than happy to, set things up and introduce other features to them and pit things against
      one another. But, the hardest thing to convince people a lot, I don't know if it's the hardest thing, but one thing that comes up a lot is a lot of times people look at the modular and they say, Oh, that's just like reason.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jason: </b>
      And, you know, there's a lot of that or, can I do all this in Ableton already? So there's a fair amount and it doesn't, it's not that I have to convince people. But I think there's a fair amount of just explaining the difference
      between using a track pad or a mouse to interface with your music totally versus having some hybrid combination of tactile interface with the benefits of modern techniques that, you know, you're afforded inside a computer. So, a lot of times
      people get it right away because, you know, you say, well, when's the last time you went to a show and you know, the guy only had a laptop on stage and how much fun was everybody having in the crowd. They know that they've been to that kind of
      event and it is seeming like, that's not what audiences are into. They want to see someone tweaking, knobs, playing an instrument for interfacing with, you know, the device that's communicated.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Yeah. That's, that's actually a really good point. This there's kind of a long running thing about, you know, watching a performer and wondering if they're getting their email. But, there's also something, something about
        seeing a performer, primarily use of computer that seems to take the risk out of a performance. And there's something about risk that seems to make a performance more interesting. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jason: </b>
      That's true. Yeah. That's sort of scary, tense <span style="color:red" data-ts="667.07" data-end_ts="667.25" title="667.07" id=c_"667.07">__know__</span>, is everything going to go wrong?
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Right. And, and there's this sense that if, if everything could potentially go to hell that if it doesn't go to hell, then you actually saw something amazing. Sweet. You do, you know, looking around you, you have a, really
        pretty awesome set of little modular systems all around. And I noticed that, yesterday when we were here setting up people kind of wander in and play for a while and we'll wander out and you didn't really, you, you certainly aren't pushing
        people to buy, which is kind of interesting. But to what extent you find people coming in and working with these systems to just learn what's going on and, and understand as part of a longer learning process for themselves </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jason: </b>
      A lot of times, and it doesn't, it's not just in modular, but absolutely. Very few people that are just dipping their toe into modular come in and that day leave with a case with a full voice or even just a few things a lot of
      times, yeah. They want to come in and they want to look around and get a feel for it. The first thing is almost like, wow, I didn't know. They were that small, you know, on the internet. It makes things, you know, nobody holds up a quarter to
      anything anymore, you know, you don't know. And, and so, you know, just seeing things in person and seeing how, how the modules fit in the case is one thing, connecting them through cables and the difference between audio rate and control
      voltage. Those are the things that they're building blocks and like the next time they come in, then it's time to talk about what the hell <span style="color:red" data-ts="770.22" data-end_ts="770.34" title="770.22"
        id=c_"770.22">__would__</span> BCA does, or, you know, something like that. Or why would I need a final stage output? So, you know, they've gone home, they've done some research, they've maybe talked to some friends or looked at <span
        style="color:red" data-ts="779.52" data-end_ts="779.82" title="779.52" id=c_"779.52">__friend's__</span> cases. But besides that even just synthesis, we get a lot of people that come in that just want to put on headphones on, you know, any,
      you know, just pick any random synth in here and just play around and move knobs and see what the attack does and see how many different programs are in the presets and, and play around.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>That's actually an interesting point and something I hadn't really thought of because we've become so sort of like attached to the internet as a way that we learn things, but reading about and sort of like intellectually
        understanding what a, an attack phase on an envelope does is one thing and hearing it, or, you know, again, feeling it, I tend to always go back to phrases like feeling and, you know, internalizing things because it seems like, it seems like
        these analog systems in general have a lot more of a feeling quotient to them and then an understanding quotient. So it sort of would make sense that, that this isn't something you can just kind of point to a Wikipedia page and say, go read
        that and you'll understand what an envelope actually does because there's this sense that without it actually being hooked up to something and trying it, you're not going to get a real understanding of what's going on. So since you were
        involved with a lot of online stuff, you kind of understand how communities work, how, how did you, how do you transform the things you learned <span style="color:red" data-ts="879.72" data-end_ts="879.8" title="879.72"
          id=c_"879.72">__and__</span> the experiences that you had, from, in an internet type environment to now meeting people? Face-to-face, </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jason: </b>
      It's a totally, it's, it's energizing actually. You know, unfortunately I wish I still had the time to, I don't to be a bigger part of the online communities again, but the, the business is, pretty much all encompassing. So now I
      do almost total face-to-face or, you know, on the phone or email directly with customers or friends and such. How is it different? It's, it's amazing to see people who, who would largely be Googling and looking on Wikipedia and looking at, you
      know, sound on sound articles to put the pieces together, to be able to come in and ask questions, and lean over. And when they know something that somebody, you know, a stranger in the shop that has headphones on is struggling with, we see
      people all the time say, Oh, man, you got to turn this up. Or, while you're into that, like we should, I have one of those too, or I had one of those that goes really good with this thing.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jason: </b>
      Let's jam and people exchange numbers, emails, and get together. We've had a whole lot of connections to be made since, since opening. But, yeah, it's, it's pretty energizing to see people in the flesh, you know, and get to shake
      hands and find out what's important to them and be able to help them out in some way. And we can't help everybody out. There's a large DIY community here getting into caring and supporting tiny components and lots and lots of that kind of stuff
      may not be where we're going, but we try to help, you know, we offer services and we do have <span style="color:red" data-ts="981.47" data-end_ts="981.65" title="981.47" id=c_"981.47">__a__</span>, a random surplus DIY tour that sort of changes
      with what I end up buying extra of for <span style="color:red" data-ts="988.07" data-end_ts="988.22" title="988.07" id=c_"988.07">__little__</span> projects I'm working on. So, we'll see, we'll see how much cooler it can get. I mean, I have all
      the faith that people are still gonna continue to get into it. So there's a lot of, a lot of new blood.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>There is one of the things, Blake, you know, the, the primary, place online that people need is the MF Wigler's forum. I just remember, when I first got into it <span style="color:red" data-ts="1014.91" data-end_ts="1015.03" title="1014.91"
          id=c_"1014.91">__too__</span>, they have the little tag thing on the bottom. And, you know, when I first got into it, I think there were like 1800 people signed up to the forum and now there's like 10 times that number.
        Right. And it's really, it seems to be kind of growing, growing quickly. But the one thing I, one thing I say, and, and it's interesting, when I kind of walked through your shop is that you are not sort of like a fundamentalist about, modular
        stuff or about particular manufacturers. So you have a bunch of modular stuff, but you also have keyboards since a variety of different types, which are fun to play with. And you also have like these cookie systems, like the Atari critter
        stuff, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1067.5" data-end_ts="1067.59" title="1067.5" id=c_"1067.5">__is__</span> that yeah. Yeah. Okay. And, and I see that you have little kit packs for making things <span style="color:red" data-ts="1076.21"
          data-end_ts="1076.39" title="1076.21" id=c_"1076.21">__about__</span> goops and stuff like that. So you see that you're not really doing the DIY thing, but it seems like you kind of embrace it all. What for yourself, what is it that
        determines whether you're going to have something in the shop and whether you're going to put the time in to promote it, </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jason: </b>
      We'll put the time in to promote it comes naturally. If I, if I like something or I get like really good feedback from, a good amount of customers on something, then, then that just comes naturally. And I think that I don't, I,
      I'm not really a, I don't, I'm not a sales guy. I don't have a sales background. I have service background, honestly. And, and obviously music, but professionally, a lot of service. So, I don't the whole upselling or whatever, you know, it's
      not, that's not my wheelhouse at all. What I carry depends largely if you're talking to modules because there are so many options out there and so many manufacturers, we are constantly expanding. We do, we've done a couple of, major ads of
      maybe three to five manufacturers once or twice a year in the last year and a half.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jason: </b>
      And it's largely, we go for manufacturers that either are doing something unique, interesting, or DIY and inexpensive, or they have an enormous, awesome catalog of stuff. That's just excellent quality. And the other thing too, is
      obviously people come in through the door and they're like, man, I want to buy this. I want to buy this. I want to buy this. Then, then that's going to happen in fact, as well. But the kooky stuff and the DIY stuff, it's a lot of stuff that I
      bought as a consumer and enjoyed. So when we chose products to start out with was a lot of things that I had, or I knew that friends had that I played with could vouch for, you know, just the quality or, or the overall benefit, even if it is
      inexpensive, it's, it's small. And, you know, you take the, the, the cheapest mini keyboard with a grain of salt. Yeah. It's, it's, it's not going to sound like a hammer action, you know, but it is going to fit in your back pocket, right?
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1213.91" data-end_ts="1214.18" title="1213.91" id=c_"1213.91">__That's__</span> one of the things we noticed is you tend to really focus on things that are smaller in size and stuff like
        that. And what I'm wondering is to what extent that is sort of like your personality being, brought to bear on what you like to sell. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jason: </b>
      Perhaps, people like small stuff though, too. I like small stuff, small stuff is less expensive. A lot of times, we are introducing a lot of new people to it. So, your average guy, he may to come in and play on the mini mode
      Voyager, but he's probably going to settle on a court <span style="color:red" data-ts="1252.6" data-end_ts="1253.17" title="1252.6" id=c_"1252.6">__Boca__</span> or a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1254.52" data-end_ts="1255.11"
        title="1254.52" id=c_"1254.52">__microbrewery__</span> or something.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>The small stuff has a tendency to not, you don't have to make such a like psychic commitment to it also, you know, that the voice you're, Xcel is pretty incredible, but I can barely lift up <span style="color:red" data-ts="1272.58"
          data-end_ts="1272.87" title="1272.58" id=c_"1272.58">__seem__</span> nervous, let alone imagining touring with it <span style="color:red" data-ts="1275.72" data-end_ts="1276.23" title="1275.72" id=c_"1275.72">__herself__</span>. Yeah. It'd
        be crazy. It's a size of a table. Yeah. So let's talk a little bit about, your background. Cause you mentioned that, you had, you know, you have background doing music and stuff. What kind of
        stuff were you doing from a performance or per production kind of standpoint were where were you coming from on that? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jason: </b>
      I mean, as a kid rock stuff, garage rock and playing around jam and metal, all that kind of everything that can make noise after the guitar I was plugging into and making crazy stuff. And then it got maybe a little more, towards
      the production side, I started helping friends produce and got really interested in having with the means that we had available the best quality that we could put out. So, and it was just friend projects, nothing professional at the time. But
      when the time came to choose what to do after high school, I went pretty much straight into music technology. My local community college didn't have any kind of music technology program, but the County next to mine did, and they were developing
      a recording
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Studio. So it was the second year. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jason: </b>
      And I ended up becoming really good friends with the director and helped them set up the studio. We set it up pretty much together. We had a pretty good, friendship going on too. And then immediately after that, I got a couple of
      internships actually during college too. And then right after, community went to, SAE in New York. But I think it was the, either the second or third graduating class of that first <span style="color:red" data-ts="1377.42" data-end_ts="1378.29"
        title="1377.42" id=c_"1377.42">__SAE__</span>. And then I worked in studios and New Jersey and Manhattan, basically intern assistant engineer. And when work until 6:00 AM on other people's music became cumbersome. I went into computer repair
      and at the time it was kind of a, it was a great thing to just shift and still be, you know, I was introduced to max actually through I'm sorry, Apple computers through working in studios on ProTools rigs and became the guy that had to fix the
      pro tools rig when it went down.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jason: </b>
      So post that to work <span style="color:red" data-ts="1419.51" data-end_ts="1419.6" title="1419.51" id=c_"1419.51">__in__</span> at a wonderful company in New York, a third-party Apple services and a retail place on 23rd street,
      for a long time. And I really enjoyed the community aspect of that business. And I took a lot of what I saw there with the way that owners let the employees pretty much self-manage. And, there, we started with 50, I started there when there's
      50 people, by the time I left, there was 200, it was an amazing amount of experience. And I put a lot of things in my virtual backpack. Well, if I ever have a company, you know, I'm gonna think about things a little bit more. I'm going to think
      about the design of the store and how people are gonna walk around and how they're going to interact, and whether salespeople are going to be harping on them or, and how customer service was going to be.

      <b>Jason: </b>
      You know, so, I also had other experiences at other companies to the contrary that also went in my backpack of, you know, what I would do is if I could ever start the company that I wanted to. So those things help as well. And
      then we visited Portland quite a bit. We had a lot of friends up here. We moved to Philly for a little bit. And we really wanted to move here, but Philly was the, was close enough from New York where we could see if we could actually leave New
      York because a lot of times <span style="color:red" data-ts="1507.07" data-end_ts="1507.13" title="1507.07" id=c_"1507.07">__he__</span> gets sort of stuck. You feel like there's nothing else out there, but in New York, so dip your toe into the
      rest of the country found out it was totally cool <span style="color:red" data-ts="1513.73" data-end_ts="1513.82" title="1513.73" id=c_"1513.73">__and__</span> visited Portland. I actually came to Mississippi app where we are now. And I knew
      that this was the joint, that this was the street that, you know, and this is six, seven years ago.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jason: </b>
      And, when we moved here, I got another job in service, but that company unfortunately, was on a downturn that I wasn't aware of the major time. So it went under not too long after I started, which actually afforded me the time to
      start planning this. And I spent a lot of time at the library and a lot of time talking to the small business administration and the volunteers there, just out of a cold call to a realtor, you know, she told me about a space that was opened up
      by Mississippi. And didn't take one for us to jump on.

    <p>
      <b>Jason: </b>
      It's amazing. I actually, I don't mind the mist. It doesn't take long for the mist to just sort of the background noise. It's not really a big deal, but, but really in reality, it's the people here. It's just the attitude. It's
      very, it's just super laid back. There's a lot of nature I'd like to soak in some, some good hikes and some good camping. So yeah, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1629.66" data-end_ts="1629.78" title="1629.66" id=c_"1629.66">__we__</span> take
      advantage of that as much as possible. It's just, it's isolated, I think from the country, it's not exactly easy to get to. It's not a major city. So, you know, Seattle is a pretty huge city and it's only three hours away. It's got totally a
      total different vibe, you know, and that's true. I think Portland has a lot of connections. And a lot of real connections with people that have moved back and forth from San Francisco to Portland, from Austin to Portland, to Portland, to
      Austin. So there's a lot in Asheville, North Carolina, surprisingly, there's a lot of people that it's sort of in that triangle.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Yeah. That's, that's interesting because I certainly know a fair number of people that are here from San Francisco. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1680.17" data-end_ts="1680.34" title="1680.17" id=c_"1680.17">__This__</span>
        seems to be like a good, good transition point because you have a lot of similar cultural senses, but maybe not the, well, I guess you don't have to worry about Twitter buying your block and turning it into loft jobs spots. <span

        climbing out of its own ass right now. I think, Portland seems to be a nice escape point for a lot of people, given that you kind of have your arms around a lot of different parts of this particular corner of the, of the music industry, the
        music equipment industry, you probably are in a pretty interesting place to be able to imagine what the future looks like. And especially because you work not only with, I mean, you've got some Mulgan DSI instruments, you work with some of
        the people that are kind of like major manufacturers, cork as well. You have equipment from the modular manufacturers from small, some of the smaller people like Keith McMillan and some of these other folks and even the tiny people, like the
        critter stuff. Where do you see the future, some of this stuff going, is it just going to expand to the point where almost everybody is making something or is where do you think it's going to go? Do you think that modulars continue to expand?
        Do you think it's going to move in a different direction? Just from, </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jason: </b>
      I like the question. I think it's gonna, I, I don't, I don't know obviously, but I do foresee some crossover, big guys going little, little guys going big, and whether that's modular going standalone or standalone going modular or
      new formats coming out, perhaps even an ex I, I, I'm not sure I'm excited as hell for whatever happens because, I think
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jason: </b>
      We are in a position to quickly adapt to the, what people are putting out and what people want. But yeah, there are so many people that come in that look at modules and they just want to turn them around. I look at the circuits and they
      say, I can do that. I can do this. When I build this, will you buy it? They say it all the time. And a lot of it's a lot of cases, a lot of people have, have, woodworking background and see how easy it is to make the case and what the markup is
      on that. And there are many complexities to building a case that are, that are that go overlooked? I think a lot of times, I don't know that I've had very many DIY cases come through. We've had a couple people build DIY modules, and then we
      sell them, that, you know, at, at a DIY type price, obviously with a different kind of warranty.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jason: </b>
      But, it's, it's impressive how much people want to be a part of it. There's definitely prospectors. There are people that are in electronics that aren't in music at all that come through. And Mississippi is a great place to spend
      the day, honestly, just with your family, going restaurant to shop, to bar, to plead sort of place to venue at night and all that, where people come in and they're there in a, in a parallel market, but they see people in the shop playing
      around, they see the momentum and they're like, well, maybe my business can get into this side of electronics. I don't know. What I would like to see, I'd like to see some module makers go standalone. I think that there's a, there's a big
      benefit to having a unified system from one maker. And that's, partially because, I think it's, I'm just personally interested in seeing some of these things that might come out, you know, that might be akin to some of the reverse of what
      mutable did, you know, going from standalone to modular.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jason: </b>
      Maybe there's some learning that can happen in the modular sense that might bring a company like that back to standalone, you know? We'll see. So yeah, it's a, it's an interesting, it's going to be interesting for sure. It, it
      it's, I hear people say a lot. That is it. It's almost a Renaissance of analog right now, but it's, it's more than that. There's a, there's a hybrid thing happening with digital and analog. And, and I, I think that one of the biggest, maybe not
      overlooked, maybe sometimes overlooked benefits of analog is that the parameters are broken out to the front of the panel. You have to enter, you almost always have to interact with them on a one-to-one basis. And you get, you know, this is a
      weird example, but if you want it to drag your forearm across 16 knobs on an analog synth, you could on a digital sin, you have to go <span style="color:red" data-ts="1983.38" data-end_ts="1983.47" title="1983.38" id=c_"1983.38">__to__</span>
      that. Right. So, but some combination of that analog interface with the benefits of modern digital technology.

      In this town modular video synthesis has, and I, we don't sell video module sentence yet, but there's a lot of dudes that do it. And whether it's a hybrid of computer with, some analog modules helping out, or a total modular video
      system, there's, there's quite a few people in town that do it. It's, it's surprising because I don't know how many fold more expensive it is than regular modular audio sense systems. But people are really into it. I, I kind of want to see it
      go to the next level. It, to me it's amazing. And it's fun and it's, it's the same sort of exploratory, learning experience, problem solving that I love getting out of a modular <span style="color:red" data-ts="2067.43" data-end_ts="2067.76"
        title="2067.43" id=c_"2067.43">__synth__</span>, but it kind of looks like Nintendo II to me. I want to see what the next year holds for that. I think that there's probably some interesting hybrid type systems I think come out that I'd like
      to see.

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Yeah. You know, I actually, it seems like you make a good point. It seems like in a way where those systems are right now are kind of paralleling what we saw in the very earliest days of the Renaissance of modular sense, which
        was, you know, the first bunch of things that came out were sort of a re-introduction of the basic subtractive since stuff. And then all of a sudden we started seeing the kind of hybrid, weird wave cable, oscillators, cookie DSP based things
        that kind of provided a hybrid interface. You know, that's actually kind of a, so maybe it's just that the very, very early stages you see that there's a lot of people around here doing that stuff. Just what, with like home built crazy stuff.

        a replacement for a filter I had in my system. And so I was able to run around and all of a sudden now, instead of having to like buy one, try it, hate it, sell it, try another one. I was able to try like eight filters, right. To, to check it
        out. You every day, have the opportunity to experience that. Right. And so my, my feeling is that somewhere in your guide, you have to be like this. If there was this one thing that would really be a game changer, right? Yeah. Yeah. And
        conversely, it's like, everyone's starting to do this thing and I wish they would just knock it off, you know? </i>

        id=c_"2252.07">__this__</span> funny Cramer sort of family thing where there's all these ideas. Nobody does anything about them, but we got a thousand ideas. So I got all these little stupid ideas that are just like little simple ones that I
      wish I'd see. Like, I was talking to my friend the other day. I wish that there was a module and granted it would take up too much space, but that just had a little mini, regular one opt in wipe and black key keyboard on it, you know, just to
      perform it. And granted critter and guitar has the melody mill. But the idea is even simpler than that, you know? So <span style="color:red" data-ts="2286.21" data-end_ts="2286.35" title="2286.21" id=c_"2286.21">__th__</span> that's just

      Out of the modular world, I am very excited for the electron analog rhythm. I think that a MPC sort of, I definitely don't want to say killer, but an MTC rival like that with philosophy sensitive pads on the power of the
      sequencing. That's a machine that I've seen in my head for years. Just something that does something similar to the MPC, but not, but with, with a much different approach. Yeah, so those are, those are a couple things, stuff that I would wish
      people stopped doing, man. I don't know that I want anybody to stop doing it, even if I don't like it. I think, I think people should keep doing stuff. You know, if, if the asphalt is out because it was a bad idea, well, at least you try <span
