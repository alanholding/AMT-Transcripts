      <i>Okay today, I get a chance to talk to somebody that came out of nowhere for me. I was kind of like sitting back one afternoon, paging through Facebook and all of a sudden I saw some entries about some of my favorite <span style="color:red"
          data-ts="16.53" data-end_ts="17.22" title="16.53" id=c_"16.53">__sense__</span> and a person talking about doing some development on sound design. And as time went by, it was more and more of my favorite sense. It got to
        be a, it was like watching a parade of all my favorites, and this person was involved in working with both the companies and with the individual machines over an incredible period of time. Now, anyone who listens to this podcast knows I kind
        of love, talking to people who got a chance to serve through all of the changes that happened in synthesis from like the eighties through the two thousands and beyond. If there's anybody that answers that call it's today's guest, his name is
        drew Sleshinger and I am just going to jump into it and say hi, so Hey drew, how you doing? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Drew Schlesinger: </b>
      I am doing great. How are you, Darren?
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>I want to thank you for taking this chat. This is, I will tell you, man, I was blown away when you started like listing the different things that you had worked on. And I was just like, I mean, it literally was like watching a
        parade of my favorites or we'll walk, walk past the <span style="color:red" data-ts="86.48" data-end_ts="86.6" title="86.48" id=c_"86.48">__beach__</span>. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Drew: </b>
      That's great. It's interesting. The whole history of how it started and the number of projects and products that I got to work on. I finally put a list together and started looking at it and I was like, wow, that's a lot of stuff.
      Right.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>So, for people who aren't aware, why don't you give us a quick tour of what that body of work is </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Drew: </b>
      Right. A quick tour. Okay. So it really started in 86, starting with the Casio CZ one, <span style="color:red" data-ts="118.16" data-end_ts="118.3" title="118.16" id=c_"118.16">__a__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="118.31"
        data-end_ts="118.67" title="118.31" id=c_"118.31">__CZ__</span> one Oh one actually <span style="color:red" data-ts="120.62" data-end_ts="120.77" title="120.62" id=c_"120.62">__did__</span> some cartridges, did some sound patches, sold them
      at Manny's. And then Casio asked me to a show at a Nam show in the summer, I guess it was 87 or 88. And from there I just started attending Nam shows and eventually got to meet the people who were responsible for sound sounds and sound design
      for products across pretty much any manufacturer that was doing either affects devices or synthesizers. And I just kept knocking on their doors and saying, Hey, I, you know, this is what I do. And I started getting a resume and one thing led to
      another and it was pretty much all the manufacturers, Roland Korg, and Sonic Kurzweil, Yamaha. It's just hard to remember why techniques and then effects even tide, lexicon, Sony, Yamaha, and you know, just one thing led to another. I started
      getting some very good response and it was really just promoting myself and trying to get involved and build trust with these companies. And they would tell me about things that were upcoming and Emu was another big one. So between 86 and 2000,
      I was, that was how I was making my living doing sound design.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Yeah, it's really remarkable because that was, that was, there is sort of like this whole end of the music business that kind of doesn't exist anymore. I mean, you talk about like selling cartridges for the Susie <span style="color:red"
          data-ts="222.21" data-end_ts="222.9" title="222.21" id=c_"222.21">__one-on-one__</span> and I remember, I mean, that was my interaction with Manny's was buying carts for the Casio or buying <span style="color:red" data-ts="232.53"
          data-end_ts="232.92" title="232.53" id=c_"232.53">__IES__</span>, Q1 carts and stuff like that. They were one of the stores that actually was, pretty big into supporting, sound designers. I remember them them particularly I
        having interactions. I think they actually spun that off into like a side business or something. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Drew: </b>
      There was a guy who at Manny's, who was the keyboard, the main keyboard guy, his name was Rick Stevenson, who was recently passed away, who really ran a very tight ship there, but he really knew what was going on. And he was very
      supportive of sound designers. And I think it really started with the D the DX seven really changed everything when there were carts and you could store something right. There was a hardware medium. Originally, as I said, I started on paper. I
      started selling Manny's patches on paper, and then the easy CZ cartridges came out, which allowed 64 sounds and Manny's picked them up. And then, I actually, just how that business started. I went to the public library in New York city and went
      through all of the major city yellow pages, looking for music stores, got the names, called them up. And let's say, I've got this cartridges for Castillo CZ. And, you know, I think you, if you're selling them, they sell well selling them at
      Manny's. And eventually I had this mail order business where I was sending out Cod packages around the country, at ups, you know, going there with a satchel at late at night.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>That's, that's amazing. That's that's wild now. One of the things that really blew me away was not only the number of things that you had done, but the extent to which you were responsible for some really iconic sounds or the
        years. I mean, the one that just really, I mean, very seldom do we think of specific sounds and, and say, first of all, that completely defines piece of gear. But secondly, I, I learned the person who did it and the one that blew me away was
        when you mentioned that you were involved in, you were working with even tide and came up with the black hole algorithm, which I swear they could, they could repackage, the S the space reverb. They could just basically call it the black hole.
        They could package anything with no knobs. I would be, I would be the happiest user. They would find. I mean, it's, it's where that thing sits all the time. And so I was really blown away to say, to, to be able to say, Oh, wow, this, this is
        a person that was involved in the creation of that song. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Drew: </b>
      That one, I there's really two. And both of them even tied that one. And previously to that on the eighth street thousand was crystal echos, which turned into what we now know as shimmer. That was the first commercial version of
      that. I think Brian, you know, had done something with an AMX unit on his recordings prior to that, but there wasn't really a product available, but black hole came about when they were developing the DSP 4,000 and they had amazing team
      building that, Ken, Bob, Donna wetsuit went on to found sound toys. And Dave <span style="color:red" data-ts="437.05" data-end_ts="437.44" title="437.05" id=c_"437.05">__***<inaudible>***__</span> who built the destressor empirical labs. So
      they had an incredible team and they had this really convoluted computer program called a SIG editor. They still have it and it's graphical now, but at the time it was how you built algorithms. I learned to <span style="color:red"
        data-ts="455.71" data-end_ts="455.92" title="455.71" id=c_"455.71">__say__</span> editor and realize that I was actually doing computer programming. Instead, you realize that you're actually programming. Well, I guess I am. And black hole was
      an algorithm. I did it like 3:00 AM one night, and it was just taking a number of diffusers and setting them up in a certain configuration. So it really was an black hole is actually an algorithm built from the modules that they had internally
      in the stake editor. And it just sort of took on a life of its own. And yeah, I would say that that's probably the most well-known patch that I've done ever for any device.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Yeah. Well, it's, it's just so iconic and it's, it's amazing to be able to talk to someone about the development of that. We're going to talk more about some of these things. So I have a ton of questions, but before we do, one
        of the things that I like doing in my podcast is talking to people about their background, how they grew up and became and entered the industry. But also my podcast talks to people that have both an art and a technology side to their lives.
        And, man really sound design is probably the epitome of, of combining the two, because what you're doing is you're the technology and finding a way to make it musical, to make it artful in a way that other artists are going to be able to
        build on top of. Right. And so I find, I find sound designed to be a particularly interesting, interesting area. I'm curious, what is your background, both your musical and your technological or your technical background that kind of put you
        in a good position to take this on as your work. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Drew: </b>
      So got to go back to 19. S really started in 75. I was going to school at Ethica college. That was right when synthesizers were really just starting to move was there. And they were starting to come out a little bit larger. You
      know, you had the arc 2,600 and the <span style="color:red" data-ts="584.27" data-end_ts="584.45" title="584.27" id=c_"584.27">__arc__</span> Odyssey. My first synthesizer was shown by a guy named Don <span style="color:red" data-ts="587.93"
        data-end_ts="588.35" title="587.93" id=c_"587.93">__Crocker__</span> of who knew Moog. He showed the micro mode in a class that I was taking and I was like, I'm going to get one of those went home for Christmas. I said to my parents, I said,
      I want to buy a synthesizer. That's what I want. It's not that expensive. It wasn't cheap. And that was my freshman year of college. So I got that. I had played Oregon. I never took any really serious music lessons. So I'm pretty much a
      self-taught musician starting in on the Oregon.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Drew: </b>
      I had a Gibson Oregon, like the one that the Ray Manzarek doors, the one Oh one and over the next couple of years, I started buying gear, but probably the most seminal and important thing that I did was in the summer of 76. I went
      to the Boston school of electronic music for a summer session there that was led by Jim Michener. Hyson wrote the <span style="color:red" data-ts="644.51" data-end_ts="644.66" title="644.51" id=c_"644.51">__art__</span> 2,600 manual. They had
      an incredible, it was actually an apartment, a large apartment in Boston. And I spent a summer there and really learned synthesis. I mean the basics of analog synthesis from really some of the smartest people at the time, it was really a great
      place. That's really how I started getting deeply involved in synthesis and then all my free money that I could make and had went towards buying gear. I then bought an overheim expander module and a little, the eight step sequencer.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Drew: </b>
      I had a four track and I, while I was at college, I built out a pretty decent small recording studio that was electronic music focused. And that was really how it's, how it started. And then from that point, I did the recording
      with David torn in 1978, when he bought an <span style="color:red" data-ts="702.23" data-end_ts="702.44" title="702.23" id=c_"702.23">__AARP__</span> avatar, I said, Hey, I heard you bought this avatar. I haven't the studio. Why don't you bring
      it over? I'll show you how to use it. We can explore it. And I had been doing some recording. Then we ended up recording something like 20 pieces together, which sat in obscurity for 40 years until last year. So that's how, that's how my
      background started.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Got it. Now, sound design, like work now is a little bit different because you know, people it's sort of gotten normalized that artists will make their own sounds. That wasn't really the case. When some of these early machines
        came out, you talked about particularly the DX seven, you know, there, there are so many stories about like technicians getting a five-year-old DX seven in for repairs and not a single preset had been changed. Right. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Drew: </b>
      Totally true. For the profit five, that was
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Profit that, </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Drew: </b>
      You know, most of the units that came back still had the factories,
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>The factory sounds, but now one, so for you as a person who is making sounds, what did you do to sort of like inspire yourself to make things that you thought would be worth sharing? I mean, were you like in a band and you
        made, sounds that worked in your band, did you just love making sounds and hope that other people would like them? Did you get commissions for people? How did you get, how did you get pulled into design sound design and how did you get
        inspired to make things for other people to use? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Drew: </b>
      So that's a great question. And it really started with the CZ one Oh one, which I bought and fell in love with. And of course it had the cartridge expandability, and I just started making sounds. And I made sounds that well, my
      tagline was the most unique and musically useful sounds for the Casio CZ. So I would listen to all the music that was happening and I would imagine the different types of tones that somebody might want and the Casio, some of the internal sounds
      were really cheesy, right? So I was really trying to make a really wide selection of sounds that I could see people using in recording or playing in bands. Analog sounds some digital sounds. I tried to stay, stay away from cheesy sounds. So
      some really warm sounds. So I really try to design sounds that would provide sort of a, if you think about it as an orchestration, you know, I'm going to use these sounds together.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Drew: </b>
      That would be sort of complimentary but different. So I kept thinking about, you know, how would you have an orchestra? What are the kinds of tonalities you'd have in an orchestra from an electronic music perspective? I tried to
      make them all playable so that a keyboard is, could play with them and hopefully they would resonate and that they work inspirational. They inspire them to make music. So I guess I was good at because people responded and they really liked
      them. I got fan mail, which was really funny because I was selling them. It really started, I, I started with a little ad in the back of electronic musician and people would order them, I'd sell them Cod and I'd ship them out. And I get letters
      saying, these are great. When are you going to put out a next one? And then I ended up making three 64 voice cartridges. And they, they sold really well. I mean, I really was able to make a good portion of my living, selling those cartridges, C
      O D N two stores. So,
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>And did you just like buy by the memory carts, retail, and then Mark it up from there? Or did you have any arrangement with Casio themselves? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Drew: </b>
      No. It was nothing to do with Casio, except that they were very supportive and I met Jerry <span style="color:red" data-ts="947.59" data-end_ts="948.39" title="947.59" id=c_"947.59">__***<inaudible>***__</span> Alstrom from Casio
      through Manny's, but the carts, <span style="color:red" data-ts="951.85" data-end_ts="952.09" title="951.85" id=c_"951.85">__like__</span> I found the manufacturer, I contacted them. I had boxes made, I printed up the inserts. So it was really
      like ran out of my apartment on the upper West side of New York. I was buying the pieces, putting them together, programming each one by hand with a little portable Commodore 64 and a passport <span style="color:red" data-ts="973.9"
        data-end_ts="974.2" title="973.9" id=c_"973.9">__mini__</span> interface, one of the first ones. And I forget which editor software and I'd flip the switch load, a bank, flipped a switch load, <span style="color:red" data-ts="981.22"
        data-end_ts="981.28" title="981.22" id=c_"981.22">__the__</span> banks. So it was pretty tedious. So what I started selling a lot of them, I was still a one man band. So, it was a lot of work, but it was very satisfying.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Sure, sure. Yeah. I'll bet. I'll bet. Now, one of the interesting things is, is it was kind of the advent of digital synth systems. They kind of opened a door for doing, doing your kind of work too, because prior to that, I
        mean, there were, there were presets and, and like you said, you could, you could sell <span style="color:red" data-ts="1012.66" data-end_ts="1012.84" title="1012.66" id=c_"1012.66">__us__</span>, get some information out to people with <span
          style="color:red" data-ts="1014.82" data-end_ts="1015.09" title="1014.82" id=c_"1014.82">__PAC__</span> sheets, but it was really those cartridges. And then later on floppy disks that were embedded in the machines that were really the
        transport mechanism that let you have kind of a robust, robust business, right? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Drew: </b>
      Yes, it was, it was actually the ability to have a portable, as you said, transportable mechanism to deliver the sounds plugged. The sounds in floppy disks obviously were great, but most of what I did were, were on the cartridges.
      I then, then I did some Ram cards for the Kauai <span style="color:red" data-ts="1046.23" data-end_ts="1046.95" title="1046.23" id=c_"1046.23">__***<inaudible>***__</span> and at that point, pretty much all the synthesizers started to have that
      capability, the ability to plug in some sort of media, whether it was a cart or a Ram card and load additional sounds. And if you think about it, I mean the prophet five and the Oberheim four voice, well, the prophet five had a cassette
      interface, which was notoriously finicky. You know, it was rough. Yeah. And not something you could do easily, which is probably why most of the soundscape, most of the units came back with the factory sounds. So yes, you're absolutely right.
      Once there was a medium to deliver the sounds that really opened the door. And there were a number of companies, there was a company called Valhalla, a fat man music sound source unlimited out in LA, which had Manny Fernandez who had done a lot
      of Yamaha work. So it was really the start of third party sound, sound, where that was really where it started.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Yeah. And I remember actually there was like for the Esq one, I remember getting like sound crystals and stuff like that. There was a wide wide range of companies and, and you would get keyboard magazine and fully half the ads
        were sound companies. It was, it was a real boom of a business. It's, it's something else. Now my question for you is you kind of worked from that into actually working with the manufacturers themselves. So then when, you know, with, with
        Roland sense and some of these others, you actually were, were involved in making the, making the presets that shipped with the machine. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Drew: </b>
      Yes. And that was, that was the big transition. And actually once I started doing that, I stopped selling my own sounds. So I had to put up the Casio carts, I put the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1163.27" data-end_ts="1164.2"
        title="1163.27" id=c_"1163.27">__***<inaudible>***__</span> carts out, and then I wrote a book called the insider's guide to the Casio CZ synthesizer for Alfred publishing. Okay. And between doing that and having my name on the book and going
      to dynamic shows the next, the first job was really for the Korg M three R ethnic card. I had met Jack Hotop Korg <span style="color:red" data-ts="1186.22" data-end_ts="1186.37" title="1186.22" id=c_"1186.22">__were__</span> out on long Island.
      I was living in New Jersey. So they were local. I went there, I met them. There's a guy named Kim Holland who was the head of marketing, I think at the time. And Jack was the main sound guy, and it's still one of the best sound designers there
      are on the planet.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Drew: </b>
      And he said, well, let's give this guy a shot. And I worked on that. I did some sounds for that card and established a relationship with Korg. And then as I said, it just then I started going to the Nam shows and saying, this is
      what I've done. Send me a unit. Let me show you a couple of patches. And I really kind of established the baseline for how I would work, which is, I would say, I'm going to charge you for X dollars for each patch, whether you choose to use the,
      or not that way, the manufacturer could choose how much of a, of their budget they wanted to give to me. And it <span style="color:red" data-ts="1239.44" data-end_ts="1239.59" title="1239.44" id=c_"1239.44">__is__</span> the same for every
      manufacturer. So I had a set price on a per patch basis. And I said, just let me know how many you want. And usually it was somewhere between 25, 50 or a hundred, and that kept it even across the manufacturers. Wasn't always so great for me,
      cause it was hard, the harder the machine to program, the longer it took to make the sounds. But it was a, it was a good business model. It was even, and everybody felt that they were getting a fair shake. I wasn't giving one a better deal than
      another.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Now a lot of times the machines that you worked on. So if we look at like some of the Emu machines, some of the Roland machines, some of the Korg machines, you work on machines that, that were, you know, what we now call
        Rumplers. They had a bunch of samples in rom and then programming is sort of like take advantage of those samples. Were you ever involved in choosing or creating the samples that were used or did you generally get the machine after that was
        already locked and loaded? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Drew: </b>
      I was, I actually decided not to get involved in sampling, which is interesting to this day. I've really never been much involved on the sampling side. There were people that were doing, it were doing it better than I, I thought I
      could, I didn't have really access to a lot of the source material. So I would generally get the units once the rom was burned. And again, my approach, which was one, I was sort of a certain flavor that they would hire expressive unique sounds.
      I wasn't the guy that they came to when they wanted a realistic violin or the best piano
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Hammond or whatever. Yeah. Right. I </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Drew: </b>
      Was not that guy. I was the guy that when they wanted something that was going to be different, unique, expressive, and those were the sound emotive sounds that, you know, even if they were comping keyboard kind of sounds, but not
      using the raw sample on its own, really doing a lot of manipulation to create something different from the source sound. Even if it was a violin, I would change the attack and make it a drone with multiple layers, you know, interweaving. So
      those were the kinds of sounds that I was known for. And that was sort of my moniker after awhile. That's what I got. I got known for it.
    </p>

    <p>

      <i>What systems did you work on for Emu? Because they had a real wide spread of stuff. Were you involved in any of the Proteus? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Drew: </b>
      No, I actually gotten involved in right after the Proteus Morpheus was the first module that they came out with when they started making all those rackmount modules and the Morpheus had a Ram card slot.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Oh. So that would be like the time of like the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1406.82" data-end_ts="1407.15" title="1406.82" id=c_"1406.82">__Mo__</span> fat and planet or whatever </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Drew: </b>
      Those all came. It was, the Morpheus was first, then the ultra Proteus, both of which had the Z plane filters and these incredible function generators, which were straight out of the booklet school of function, generating devices
      that conditional jump points and all sorts of things really complex. And the Z filters really allowed you to take the rom and really manipulate it. They were great. And then they went on to the orbit, the MOFAD, the classic keys, <span
        style="color:red" data-ts="1442.15" data-end_ts="1442.24" title="1442.15" id=c_"1442.15">__the__</span> vintage keys carnival, you know, they came out with a ton of rom based modules, all similar. Yeah.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Well, it's interesting though. Cause you talk about working on the Morpheus. I knew a number of people that became obsessed with that system and, and particularly because of the Z plane filter and those crazy on envelopes. But
        a lot of times it was sort of like what now I think of as doing with max patches where people will make a thing where it lights up and then it just goes off and does a thing for a long period of time. You couldn't make those kinds of patches
        with that period's emus system. Right. How were you able to reign that in and make a musical useful sound out of something that I would think that it would be too tempting just to go off in left field. And next thing you know, you made a
        bunch of demo sounds, but not really anything that a player could use. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Drew: </b>
      And that was a constraint you had to consciously say, is this sound something that can be used within a musical context? And I always again thought from an orchestration standpoint, just general musical orchestration, how might
      somebody use the sound? Which didn't mean that I wouldn't create things that were strange, but again, you know, from a marketing standpoint, they were looking for sounds that somebody was going to say, Oh, I could see how I'm going to use that.
      So it was striking a balance between something that was interesting, unique, but again, musically useful that you could hear a tonality generally wouldn't go into non tonal sounds that went on forever. So you had to limit, limit your choices.
      Now on the side, you know, while I'm home, home doing it for myself, whole different story, then I'm trying to make it sound as way out as I possibly could.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Drew: </b>
      I was trying to make it sound like a booklet 200, but for the work that I did, you know, it was like, okay, I'm doing a job. I was hired to do a job. And I was aware that they're interested in selling units when somebody scrolled
      that dial, they wanted to be able to hit a note, play a sound, hit a note, play a sound and get some idea of what's being provided there for them. That's going to give them something different and new. And the Morpheus was great at that. As
      well as the ultra Proteus, they put the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1590.01" data-end_ts="1590.22" title="1590.01" id=c_"1590.01">__Z__</span> playing filters even to this day, there's still two iconic devices that are still, probably not
      that well known in general to synthesis yes. To the average person or, you know, not so much.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>So of all of the different devices you got to work with. Let's talk about the synthesizer side first and all the different, since that you got to work with, what was your favorite and what was the most difficult to achieve
        good results on? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Drew: </b>
      <span style="color:red" data-ts="1623.11" data-end_ts="1623.56" title="1623.11" id=c_"1623.11">__Hmm__</span>. I would say it's really hard to pick a favorite, but two in particular stand out for a number of reasons, which are the,
      the Korg prophecy and Korg <span style="color:red" data-ts="1636.22" data-end_ts="1636.49" title="1636.22" id=c_"1636.22">__Z__</span> won for a number of reasons that the physical modeling approach that they had done really provided for
      incredible expressiveness and really different sounds, both analog. And you know, they, they were doing analog, they were doing mallet sounds. They were doing blown pipe sounds. You could try to make a trumpet sound that would actually break as
      you pitched up, you know, the way a trumpet will crack if you don't play well. And those 2 cents, I got to go to Japan with Korg to do final voicing. So those two oldest special place for me, they were, they were brilliant machines. And I got
      in really early before there was even a prototype, it was on a computer prototype.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>I was gonna, I was gonna actually ask you that because the one thing I remember about both those devices is that their controller systems were actually pretty unique. Like the prophecy had that like weird roller log with a
        <span style="color:red" data-ts="1698.29" data-end_ts="1699.28" title="1698.29" id=c_"1698.29">__***<inaudible>***__</span> and stuff like that. Right. Yeah. And it seemed to me like a lot of the voices really were almost like finely tuned to
        work with the kind of manipulation you could get out of that. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Drew: </b>
      Absolutely. Actually that was part and parcel of what made those instruments unique, not only the synthesis methods, but the controls that they provided at the time, which were pretty forward thinking the log was, was a pretty
      funny one because we had all the names for it on a, on a whiteboard at Korg and they couldn't read them. Some of the names shall not be mentioned. They're politically correct. We had a whole lot of fun with those, but between the, the two
      wheels, the log, the ribbon controller embedded in the log after touch velocity, it was a ton of work to really make a sound because to a certain degree, you almost had to employ those various devices. Cause you didn't want it to sound like an
      Oregon. The idea with that instrument was to try to make it expressive and alive. Cause it wasn't a rom right.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Drew: </b>
      It's, it's really synthesis from the ground up with lots of ability to manipulate all aspects of the sound, even, even the analog stuff. So yeah, they were very forward-looking in terms of their control mechanisms and what they
      allow you to do. And the, the, we were really supposed to look to utilize those and leverage those controls to really make expressive sounds. You said, what was the hardest one? <span style="color:red" data-ts="1808.5" data-end_ts="1808.56"
        title="1808.5" id=c_"1808.5">__I'm__</span> thinking back, that's funny, maybe the Elisa's the first, at least this quadriceps and the only reason I say that it was a very powerful <span style="color:red" data-ts="1818.64"
        data-end_ts="1818.97" title="1818.64" id=c_"1818.64">__scent__</span>, but it had a one pole filter. Oh no, I think it was a 60 B cutoff, no residence. So you really had to do things with envelope shaping and various other techniques to make
      it sound different. It would sound great for acoustic sounds, but to get the kind of sounds that I'm used to doing there wasn't a lot too, from a filtering perspective to manipulate how <span style="color:red" data-ts="1848.65"
        data-end_ts="1848.76" title="1848.65" id=c_"1848.65">__to__</span> tools at hand, right? No, it was, it was straight, straight sounds. So you really had to layer things and crossfade and velocity fade, very powerful chip that they had created
      at the time. A great sound <span style="color:red" data-ts="1863.61" data-end_ts="1863.7" title="1863.61" id=c_"1863.61">__and__</span> sense, but I would say that was a challenging, device to work on and get different unique sounds
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Sure. Now the other thing is, and I know this from my work in the music industry too, you never know ahead of time, what's going to be a hit and what's going to be a stinker. Really. Sometimes you can get a sense of it when
        you're playing with it. But a lot of times you don't know until the market decides, right. I imagine that you, you worked on a lot of sense that or S or effects devices that just ended up not going anywhere or maybe just not getting their
        place in history that maybe they deserved. What are, what are some of those that, that you can think of? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Drew: </b>
      Actually, the ones that I think are most overlooked and underrated and not well known from a effects device was Sony. They came out with four devices. I don't remember what year it was, but there was a reverb, a delay, a modulation
      and a filter. And they were single Rackspace devices, beautifully designed, incredibly powerful sounded awesome. But Sony Sony's marketing was not sexy. You know, Sony had a very sort of stayed kind of approach to their marketing. And I don't
      think that those devices ever really took off the way they should have because they were great. The re there's an old story, which I mentioned in one of my Facebook posts that apparently Lou, somebody dragged a EMT, played up to his studio and
      he had the Sony R seven. And he said, no, I think the, I like what's in the suddenly box better, which I'm sure was not music to the guy who played. Right. But, so those are probably the, you know, hidden gems.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i><span style="color:red" data-ts="1981.03" data-end_ts="1981.35" title="1981.03" id=c_"1981.03">__I've__</span>, I've heard stories particularly about that. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1983.61" data-end_ts="1984.45" title="1983.61"

        because they are so beloved by some people, you know, </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Drew: </b>
      Well, it was a stereo reverb and actually they created the first stereo reverb. I think it was the two Oh one, the R two Oh one or something like that, which <span style="color:red" data-ts="2012.17" data-end_ts="2012.38" title="2012.17"
        id=c_"2012.17">__I__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2012.53" data-end_ts="2012.8" title="2012.53" id=c_"2012.53">__Nez__</span> had actually packaged. And that's probably around 86, 87. And that was the first true
      stereo algorithmic reverb. So <span style="color:red" data-ts="2022.76" data-end_ts="2023.15" title="2022.76" id=c_"2022.76">__Sonia__</span> had actually been doing it for quite a while. And I have heard subsequent that some of the chips
      inside had issues over time. You know, we're now we're talking things that were from 1990s, early nineties, so 30 years ago. Right. And I, and now as I'm starting to post some of these things on Facebook, I'm seeing that some of these devices
      had things that failed, but at the time the failure rates were very low, right. They kind of, they worked batteries most would go bad, but
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>When you're working in his stuff, whoever thinks about what, it's, how it's going to work 30 years for now either, you know, </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Drew: </b>
      Who even thought 30 years, you know, we were thinking what's coming out next, next Nam show. What's going to be in the summer Nam. And of course at that point, you know, there's no internet, what's showing up, you go to the Nam
      show and that's where you find out what's new. And that then keyboard magazine, electronic musician, those were probably the two main vehicles for getting those, you know, the word out on new products. A lot of people trying to get the, you
      know, space in the magazines for reviews, et cetera. So those are probably the, the unsung devices I'm trying to think of from the synth world. Actually the one from the synth world that probably is also similar is the techniques WSA one.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>I was going to specifically ask about that. I knew that you had worked on that. And I actually had a friend who was a big fan of that synth, but he was like the only person I ever knew who ever even had one, </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Drew: </b>
      I think techniques suffered from techniques, itis. They nobody thought techniques synthesizers.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Why would, why would I buy a synth from a company that I normally would buy a cassette deck from, right. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Drew: </b>
      <span style="color:red" data-ts="2132.68" data-end_ts="2132.77" title="2132.68" id=c_"2132.68">__A__</span> turntable <span style="color:red" data-ts="2134.12" data-end_ts="2134.51" title="2134.12" id=c_"2134.12">__Bieber__</span>.
      But really they really hit it out of the park in a lot of ways. I mean, again, it was similar in to the core devices, three wheels, huge display, an orbit controller, which was like a ball, physical modeled filters, lots of voices. That was
      also a difficult one to work with because you were, you were taking static rom sounds and you were creating the, the animation through the physical model <span style="color:red" data-ts="2166.03" data-end_ts="2166.12" title="2166.03"
        id=c_"2166.03">__to__</span> filters, had some great effects. And when I posted it, I was surprised that people were like, yeah, I have one of those. I love it. That's the one that I'm trying to find. It was totally unique and it was also
      sort of, it was a hybrid between a Morpheus and sort of the, the Korg prophecy. It sort of fell in between cause it was wrong based, but it had physical modeling with lots of control. And I think it was a commercial flop. They didn't sell many
      and unfortunately they stopped and they never took the next step. That's how corporate, you know, large corporations, it's not uncommon.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Right? Yeah. Well they never touched synthesis again ever. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Drew: </b>
      They, they were, they were gone. Right.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>So when you, when we started this talk, you talked about kind of doing it from like the late eighties through 2000. Do you still do sound design work? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Drew: </b>
      Very little. So the true story is in 1998, I joined the corporate world doing web program management in the financial services industry. And how that came about was which I haven't posted yet. I created a product called ear saver,
      which was a downloadable ambient music player. This is this predates iTunes by a few years, 97 and 98. It used a tracker engine and I made these samples little samples that I would crossfade so that I could play hour's worth of ambient music.
      It was soundscapes. I did that, put that out. It was licensed to Simon and Schuster. They put it in a box, they sold it in comp USA. And then I had a neighbor next door who was working at Merrill Lynch. He said, I need somebody to do what you
      just did with that and helped me. And over a period of two or three years, I transitioned out of the sound design.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Drew: </b>
      I think the last product that I worked on was the Vsense for Roland. Okay. And I pretty much have been quiet in the background for the last 20 years. I did some work for a few software companies. Sound toys is Ken Bugdanowitz who
      started sound toys was a main engineer at even tide. So I've done a lot of work with them over the years for all of their plugs and the rack. I did some work with G-Force on a couple of their sense. Makes sense. Sure. So I haven't really done
      much in very long time. I haven't been dormant over the last few years. I started using live and actually max for live and really starting to learn that. So it was hard. It was a, it was a very, it's like cutting the cord and just going from
      one world to the next, going from the musical industry to the corporate world was really very strange. I can show my wrap up. I said, I've landed on an alien planet. And I don't understand
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>That's what they're talking about. Well, believe me in the financial world, everybody there said, Oh my goodness, an alien just walked in the door and I still have long hair. But, and really what predicated, that
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Drew: </b>
      Was actually fear. When I saw what was going on with VSTS, when you <span style="color:red" data-ts="2370.36" data-end_ts="2370.66" title="2370.36" id=c_"2370.36">__bass__</span> came out, I started to see a noticeable decrease in
      hardware, the amount of hardware that was being built. And there's an old saying, look, afar and see the end from the beginning. And I was like, I think this is going to have a real impact on hardware manufacturing. And it did. I mean, there
      was not 2003 up until, I don't know, 2010, 11 things were pretty quiet. I mean, Korg and Roland kept turning out things, but of course in the last few years, things have just exploded. So I figured, you know, I did all this work, nobody knows
      about it. I felt like I was kind of like the Chuck Yeager of the sound design I never went <span style="color:red" data-ts="2415.57" data-end_ts="2415.63" title="2415.57" id=c_"2415.57">__to__</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, you needed, you needed your own version of the right stuff. Right, right. So <span style="color:red" data-ts="2422.26" data-end_ts="2422.4" title="2422.26" id=c_"2422.26">__I've__</span> got a piece of chewing
      gum. Don't worry. I'll be back.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Drew: </b>
      And actually I think about that movie, I think it was Apollo 13. I think it was Sam Shepard who was, who played Chuck Yeager. But, I decided, you know, I might as well put this out there. Just if nothing else, just to let people
      know that, you know, I did this work and, see what happens and also to find the other people that I knew had collaborated. I was only one of many people who contributed to these interesting instruments. So through these posts, it really has
      exposed all these other people who have done work on the same devices from different parts of the world, you know, Germany, Japan, UK. And there's some really, I mean, there's really some stellar sound designers out there. I was one of many who
      are really talented and Jack Hotop Eric person probably, you know, the pinnacle Skippy from plugin guru, Jordan rudeness was, was doing sound design as well. So there was a, a relatively small cadre of people doing it, but, larger than I
      thought. And it was interesting. It's been interesting to see and get noticed or notices back from people saying, Hey, I did sound so <span style="color:red" data-ts="2507.82" data-end_ts="2507.9" title="2507.82" id=c_"2507.82">__on__</span>
      that too. So it's been fun.
