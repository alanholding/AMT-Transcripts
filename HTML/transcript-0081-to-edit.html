<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today we are going to be hearing from Rob Ramirez. I'm gonna leave the introductions and the discussion about what he does for, a few minutes, but what I do want to say is that during the course of this discussion, we talk about a video and a production called An Evening with William Shatner Asterisk. If you haven't seen it and you probably haven't, but assuming you haven't seen it, please go to the website, art music tech.libson.com and follow the links that are there. That'll take you to, a couple of videos that will, give you a chance to experience a little bit of the William Shatner asterisk, experience, and hopefully will help the rest of this make sense. There's a lot of important stuff related to the video and related to performance, so it would be great if you got a chance to experience that before you listened or after whatever. We'll see you at the backend. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. This week I have the pleasure of introducing you to, a guy I just spent some time with. His name's Rob Ramirez. He works, with me at Cycling 74. And so we were just at a company retreat and we got a chance to hang out a little bit. But I've been wanting to talk to him, for the podcast for a while because he actually, plays in a lot of genres that I think are important to, are important to discuss. He does, he does a lot of like technical work for art, but he also is a pretty heavy duty programmer, and that combinations of, of skills right now, it's not only highly prized, but it's producing some really interesting work. So with that, I'd like to introduce you to Rob Ramirez. Hi, Rob. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert Ramirez: </b>I'm well. How are you doing, Doug? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm doing great. Thanks a lot for taking the time to talk to us today. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>My pleasure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Why don't we kick off by having you, just tell the listeners kind of what your, what you are about, what are the things that you do? What are the gigs that you, that you embrace? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Okay. Yeah. So, I guess I, when I was very young, I was, into making videos and for a long time I thought I was going to go into film and, I did do a year of film school, and, decided that that wasn't quite for me. The sort of structure and institution of, of, of making films was didn't really fit with my sort of, I had more of a d i y kind of, aesthetic to things. So, I never was into computers. I, you know, I wasn't one of those people that programmed as a kid or anything like that, but, I, sort of made this decision, around the time that computers started, you know, turn of the century when you could actually do interesting things with computers, especially related to like video. Right. And, so I decided to kind of, to learn programming and to learn sort of media, media arts <span style="color:red" data-ts="207.9" data-end_ts="208.12" title="207.9" id=c_"207.9">__is__</span> I, as an undergrad I double majored in, multimedia arts and computer programming. And it was just sort of a strategy of, you know, being able to find a job when I was done 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>As well as sort of pursuing things that I was interested in. And, towards the end of that, I, someone mentioned that I should look at Maxims <span style="color:red" data-ts="231.32" data-end_ts="231.44" title="231.32" id=c_"231.32">__p__</span> and so for about a year I was, sort of locked away in this, underground, basement closet where they had like a, the, the old, like beige G three computer, with like a max three point whatever version, and like a old mini keyboard. And, the guy was just like, kind of shoved me in there. I was like, have at it <laugh>, you know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Where was this at? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>This was just, I went to U U N C A University of North Carolina at Asheville. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>And, they had a, recording, recording engineering, program, and as well as a few others like, media multimedia, mass communications where you learn video stuff, video production. And I sort of just latched onto all that stuff. You know, I took, I took all those classes and really like, kind of got into to, I had this idea of, that, that it was all sort of related, audio and three d work and video and, this kind of thing. And it, it, at the time it sort of felt like I was just not, you know, that I was, just kind of being a Dante about all those things. And rather than like focusing on one specific thing, I just sort of like to dabble in all of them. But turns out that that actually, became somewhat of a, of an asset for me as I, kind of, you know, discovered my career, which was nice. <laugh> Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="331.94" data-end_ts="332.16" title="331.94" id=c_"331.94">__But__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="332.16" data-end_ts="332.48" title="332.16" id=c_"332.16">__again__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="332.86" data-end_ts="333.08" title="332.86" id=c_"332.86">__for__</span> the other way as well. Yeah. I just, I liked playing with lots of different things, you know, just discovered Max learned how to do some silly things, made some really silly kind of like senior project things for a, for my computer science senior project, I tried to make a max external. I had to haul my, my Mac computer to the, to the finals for the presentation. I didn't have a laptop and try and plug it in, and it wouldn't plug in. It, it, like the display wasn't working. And I'm sitting there like 10 minutes in just trying to like, get the thing running. And it's all these kind of like computer science guys who have no idea what this software was, what I was trying to do, like what, <span style="color:red" data-ts="382.38" data-end_ts="382.6" title="382.38" id=c_"382.38">__how__</span>, what that <span style="color:red" data-ts="383.04" data-end_ts="383.24" title="383.04" id=c_"383.04">__ha__</span> you know, everybody was doing like Java database apps and, you know, this kind of thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>And I had like a, a silly, like Max external that did something with audio. So that was a little discouraging. But quickly I moved, I recovered from that and continued, exploring Max moved to Brooklyn, did a, grad program called Performance and <span style="color:red" data-ts="409.12" data-end_ts="409.36" title="409.12" id=c_"409.12">__Interim__</span> Performance and Interactive Media Arts. Did another grad program called Integrated Digital Media. So basically these, all, all these grad programs are basically the same thing, a mixture of art and technology and, media and, they have different focuses, but the sort, the same sort of theme of just sort of cross cross genre multidisciplinary art, with, technology. And, so that's what I'm into since moving to New York. I've been able to collaborate with lots of different artists, doing different, different things. You know, dancer, theater, people sound people, film and video and just sort of, identifiable things like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Well, before we get, before we get to some of your current work, I want to ask a couple of questions about your history. First of all, when you talk about being kind of at, at, at the beginning being kind of fascinated with film, I mean, how, how into like the geek part of that were you, I, so for example, I, I ran across a book that kind of talked about like the whole dogma thing, right? And how that's sort of like a d i y attack on filmmaking in one direction. Right. And, you know, there were other kind of movements like that. Were you into any of those kind of things or were you too young or did you just not care? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>I mean, yeah, not so much. It, it, for me, it was just a, playing with video cameras with my friends and making, and making film, like making little, you know, silly things like that. As well as sort of, like stop motion animation. Yeah. I never really, explored it much further than that. I just, I got really, I mean, I was eight. You know, the, the thing is, I don't, I just, I was 18, I just got done with high school. I was kind of a nerd in high school, so I, you know, I kind of worked hard at it. And, and then all of a sudden I'm done with all that. And I, you know, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="546.56" data-end_ts="546.68" title="546.56" id=c_"546.56">__was__</span>, I did not have the discipline at the time to like, pursue any kind of serious study. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I'm, I'm actually really glad you say that. 'cause I, I'll tell you, I, I so often talk to people that, that make it sound like they knew exactly what they were gonna do when they were 14, and they were like fully self-actualized by the time they were 18. And, you know, they were smoking cigars and taking it easy by the time they were 26 <laugh>. And if I look back from my own life when I was 18, one of the biggest decisions I was making on a, on a weekly basis was like, am I gonna watch Saturday Night Live this week? You know, it's, I, I did not have any clue of what I was going to do. And, I so often talk to people that make it sound like, like they, they just, they were just wired at 18. I can't even imagine that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>I can't either. No, absolutely not. It, it, it was a, it was a long process. I mean, even up <span style="color:red" data-ts="614.52" data-end_ts="614.72" title="614.52" id=c_"614.52">__till__</span> like my mid twenties and, you know, after, after finishing grad school, like, there was a period where I just thought that I would be doing like freelance whatever, programming jobs that came along, you know, like there, I, for a while there I was doing, I, you know, I built a database and a website for this artist. I was working for this company that made, this software for, for kids with a d d that like helped them pay attention better by tracking their attention level. Just like random things like that. And I think I had applied for a job at a TV guide online, and it was just like, wow, my life could've really taken a different turn. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, no doubt. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>But fortunately, I got a call from you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yes, you did. It was, it was interesting because, at the time they were looking for some people to get in, get involved, and, and your name came up and, had a very interesting conversation now. But that sort of like skips a bunch of things, because I am curious, so for those people who don't know, Rob is, Rob is the person that does a significantly large percentage of the OpenGL stuff that is found inside of, the jitter, the jitter objects. And, I, I'll tell you, I Rob, I have met a lot of people that, that work in OpenGL and stuff. You are one of one of the few people that actually can look another person in the eye. You seem relatively normal <laugh>. You seem like you're integrated into society pretty well, but you're still able to, to interact with the complexities of, three D Math. How did that happen? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b><laugh>? I, I mean, the real secret is that I, I'm just taking it 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> nice. <span style="color:red" data-ts="735.34" data-end_ts="735.56" title="735.34" id=c_"735.34">__And__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>It, it's, I don't know. I, I can keep some of that stuff in my head, for, for <span style="color:red" data-ts="743.4" data-end_ts="743.52" title="743.4" id=c_"743.4">__a__</span> some period of time, but it, it all falls right out. You know, it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="748" data-end_ts="748.24" title="748" id=c_"748">__just__</span> like, you <span style="color:red" data-ts="749.52" data-end_ts="749.68" title="749.52" id=c_"749.52">__have__</span>, you basically, you have to get in the zone. You know, there's people like our, our our friend Wess Smith, who, did a lot of the GL stuff, prior to that. <span style="color:red" data-ts="759.38" data-end_ts="759.6" title="759.38" id=c_"759.38">__So__</span> when I started working there, who his, you know, his intellect and understanding of, of, of the math and the complexity and, you know, these algorithms and <span style="color:red" data-ts="773.65" data-end_ts="773.94" title="773.65" id=c_"773.65">__it's__</span>, is pretty impressive. I'm, I'm, I'm certainly not on that level, but what I have, discovered how to do is, used the resources that I have and, you know, use the internet and, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="791.63" data-end_ts="791.98" title="791.63" id=c_"791.63">__basic__</span>, a lot of, a lot of the, the coding that I'm doing is, is, is sort of, taking, other people, taking other sort of libraries or other, you know, algorithms that people have done or, you know, bits of code here and there, and figuring out how they sort of can be incorporated into, into the jitter landscape, into into the max application. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Sure. I'm able to sort of, go out in public and communicate with people <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, good. Yeah. So you're, you're saying that a lot of what you do programmatically then is kind of the glue that allows some of these libraries to work within the MAX environment? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Yeah, there, there is a lot of that. So I mean, for instance, you know, I made the, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="836.91" data-end_ts="837.15" title="836.91" id=c_"836.91">__didn't__</span>, I, or I rather I updated like the, let's say the <span style="color:red" data-ts="839.67" data-end_ts="839.79" title="839.67" id=c_"839.67">__G__</span> T <span style="color:red" data-ts="840.03" data-end_ts="840.15" title="840.03" id=c_"840.03">__L__</span> model object, two, you know, support to ba to basically do like to actually be functional <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? Right. Not 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>So much <laugh> that that really sort of, was, taking this library, that loads models and, you know, figuring out how to, how, how to incorporate that and then make it through the animation and things like that. So, I mean, there are, there are a lot of <span style="color:red" data-ts="867.47" data-end_ts="867.67" title="867.47" id=c_"867.47">__area__</span>, and the physics objects too are the same thing. Like, I, I had done some projects with them before, but it's not like I'm there like coding, you know, coming, coming up with these physics, algorithms or anything like that. Sure. But, so it's like, there's <span style="color:red" data-ts="886.01" data-end_ts="886.17" title="886.01" id=c_"886.01">__this__</span>, there's technical, there's a lot of, technical knowledge that's required, but it's, I guess I don't go around like thinking of ways of, how I can speed up the, you know, the, the broad phase basics, collision detection <span style="color:red" data-ts="904.68" data-end_ts="904.88" title="904.68" id=c_"904.68">__or__</span>, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see. So, given that you spend most of your working time in OpenGL and physics and, and rendering engines and stuff like that, is that also where your art lies? Or do you do something different when it comes to artwork? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Yeah, I mean, I, I, it is very different. I mean, this is, you know, kind of speaks to the challenge of, of being a technologist and an artist and someone that works on Max and with Max. I kind of have to separate that a bit. I mean, my art does use a lot of, of, video technology. It uses a lot of sound technology, and I use Mac pretty much primarily. But, I'm not doing a lot of like, really, you know, cutting edge work with, physics or, or three D rendering or anything like that. It's, it's actually all, it's my, my art is actually much more simplified than that. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's interesting. Although, you know, what's, what's funny is that that seems to be kind of the case. You know, I, I know a lot of the people at cycling who do artwork and, for a lot of them, they're, it's either completely away from the computer or it's using the computer as a very simple instrumentation as part of a larger performance or, or installation kind or artwork kind of a thing. <span style="color:red" data-ts="996.59" data-end_ts="996.88" title="996.59" id=c_"996.59">__Yeah__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="996.99" data-end_ts="997.28" title="996.99" id=c_"996.99">__fair__</span>. Now, now one of the, one of the pieces of artwork that you shared with me was a thing called an Evening with William Shatner, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Or is it, is that the full name of it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>It's an evening with William Shatner Asterisk. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, okay. All right. So Asterisk is actually part of the name. Yeah. Okay. I got it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1018.66" data-end_ts="1018.88" title="1018.66" id=c_"1018.66">__The__</span> Distinguish from William Shatner. It's actually 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, yeah, good point. Yeah. That, that allows you to get away with it, kind of, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>The, getting away with it was a little tricky and, we, we did manage to get away with it so far. There <span style="color:red" data-ts="1035.08" data-end_ts="1035.24" title="1035.08" id=c_"1035.08">__was__</span>, we did contact William Shatner. My director, reached out to him and actually did get permission. We didn't necessarily need permission. The thing that we, that, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1047.26" data-end_ts="1047.48" title="1047.26" id=c_"1047.26">__the__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1047.48" data-end_ts="1047.68" title="1047.48" id=c_"1047.48">__the__</span>, anyways, this piece, basically, is a, we, we've created this character, sort of a video puppet character that is uses, all the images, all these clips of Captain Kirk from the Star Trek series. And, he gives this, it's, it's sort of like a, a one man show where he gives this lecture on art and science and, the dialogue is entirely composed of little snippets of, of Kirk's dialogue. So there, as far as like copyright and stuff goes, whoever I think c b s or whoever owns the rights would have to prove that we used over a certain, like, I'm not sure what the amount is, like five minutes of an individual episode to actually issue like a take down or a cease and desist or anything like that, which would be really hard to do because it's all just like, you know, even like, like less than a second of a, of an episode would be used or something 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Like that. Yeah. Well, I, I got a chance to see the, the videos you passed on, and I'll put those up as links on, or I think, I guess I can put 'em up as links, on the, the podcast website so other people can check it out. But it, it is hilarious in that, I mean, in some cases they're probably like three frames worth of stuff because there are cases where words are sort of like built up by like sub syllables Right. And stuff. It's really flashes about pretty interestingly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Yeah. Yeah, it was sort of a, you know, we, we came up with this idea and, and started, and, you know, it took months of, I guess, you would call it pre-production Uhhuh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>To, before we could even, you know, test out the idea of like having a paragraph of text that we enter into the thing and you just start saying it. So I mean, it was a lot of, like, it was, it was a bit of a leap of faith and, so we, you know, we sort of like figured out the process as we went. It, it, it came in multiple stages. Like we had to basically, build this database of clips of Shatner, just, you know, like whenever he's on the scene, whenever he's, in, in the scene talking, we, we would grab that clip and then, you know, we had this whole database of clips. And then we, worked with some interns to trans to transcribe those. I built this app that would, you know, have this, had all these clips in the database and you could enter in the text so that we knew the words that were, that we actually had. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>And then sort of built a dictionary from that, that we gave to our writer, to use as the words. But, you know, you quickly, he quickly discovered that, the shatner's dialogue on the show is, is not vast, you know, <laugh>, he basically saying the same thing over and over again. Right. So we, you know, we had to sort of make that decision that, we were going to allow words that were not actual words that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1249.72" data-end_ts="1250.08" title="1249.72" id=c_"1249.72">__Chatter__</span> said. And, and actually, it, it, it was, that's some of the most interesting parts of, especially orally of the, of the, of the piece is, is, you know, coming up with these kind of crazy ways to make him say like, ontologically <laugh>, he never says art. He never says art in the entire, you know, why, why would Shatner ever talk about art and start? So basically, you know, that became part of the actual, that actually worked its way into the, to the, script itself is that we actually make him <span style="color:red" data-ts="1287.14" data-end_ts="1287.36" title="1287.14" id=c_"1287.14">__say__</span>, say art from another word, you know? Right. Something like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, one of the things that I thought was really interesting was the choice of William Shatner for this, because he has this like really stilted way of talking anyway. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And then when you combine it with these, like, you know, the appropriated clips being sort of like, kind of butt edited together, it sort of like, even, you know, it makes it more robotic, but even when there's a stretch where it's might be, you know, a couple of words still is like, well, it was kind of hard to tell where the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1324.58" data-end_ts="1324.8" title="1324.58" id=c_"1324.58">__cha__</span> where the cutup was and where it was him just being near robotic 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b><laugh>. Yeah. It's crazy inflection. I think <span style="color:red" data-ts="1333.58" data-end_ts="1333.8" title="1333.58" id=c_"1333.58">__the__</span>, that was definitely a part of the choice of William Shatner and it, in addition to just to kind of be such an iconic figure. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>And, none of us that sort of conceived this show actually, it was the three of us, the the director, myself and the writer, none of us, really actually watched Star Trek, or were, you know, were huge fans or anything like that. I've always been a fan of William Shatner just as a, as a figure. He's, he's kind of amazing. What I, what I really got into when making the video for this, show was, you know, he would string a bunch of of words together for his sentences, and then there would be, and then there would be a pause at the end. You know, I built this app so that I could really like fine tune, adjust the, the, you know, the lengths between the words and the pauses and all this. Sure. And just figuring out where to land, where to, you know, what facial expression for him to land on that, like, made that, that made the show for me. Just like letting, or like when the mu, you know, when there's music, like you could land on like a swell of music or you could, you know, all these like little bleeps and bloops from the Star Trek, soundtrack or, you know, the background soundtrack just like contributed to this like crazy, soundtrack of the show. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>There are cases where, you know, you hear either like, you know, the background music or the little beeps, and my assumption it was just part of the clips, except a lot of times it would be sort of the same syllable or the same word, but it would either have it or have it not. Was that always using embedded sound, or did you do some like post editing to add some of that over the top, that 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>That sort of became an aesthetic decision of the show? You know, when we originally thought about it, I, I was going to do all this crazy, like, processing noise removal and like smooth things, cross <span style="color:red" data-ts="1455.04" data-end_ts="1455.32" title="1455.04" id=c_"1455.04">__fade__</span> things, lay, lay, you know, like change the speed of things, like lay in our own soundtrack and all that. And no, no, we, we really stuck with the kind of purity of just stopping it and matching it together because we actually all sort of really liked, the sound bed that came out of that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Now, you ended up touring around with this a little bit, didn't you? Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So did it start in New York and then head out west, or 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>No, we actually started in Austin. We had a residency in Austin at this, performing arts festival called, fusebox Festival. Oh, okay. So for a month developing it. And, that's where it premiered. And then there was like about a year before, year and a half before much, else happened with it. But then we, yeah, we, we played in New York, we played in, Vancouver and in California. So, you know, a little bit of a tour. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, so doing that though, and talking about the development and talking about the aesthetics and stuff really makes me want to explore a specific part of this. So the links you gave me to look at the art at the work, are Vimeo links and, the items are shown and it says from Phil <span style="color:red" data-ts="1542.38" data-end_ts="1542.6" title="1542.38" id=c_"1542.38">__ov__</span>, is that his name? <span style="color:red" data-ts="1543.23" data-end_ts="1543.52" title="1543.23" id=c_"1543.23">__Yeah__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1543.82" data-end_ts="1544.04" title="1543.82" id=c_"1543.82">__Ov__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Right. And who I assume is the director, right? Yes. Okay. It sounds to me like the creation of this thing was sort of a collaborative effort, but in the end, somebody, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1556.94" data-end_ts="1557.16" title="1556.94" id=c_"1556.94">__and__</span> it ends up looking like a single person's piece, right? Yeah. How does, how does that feel when you're <laugh> when, when you, you've been <span style="color:red" data-ts="1568.44" data-end_ts="1568.6" title="1568.44" id=c_"1568.44">__in__</span>, you know, I'm trying to understand how, you know, when you're doing those kind of collaborative works, where, where are the lines and how do the lines get blurred in terms of, you know, this is my work, this is someone else's work. Yeah. You toured around with this thing. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1583.07" data-end_ts="1583.36" title="1583.07" id=c_"1583.07">__Were__</span> you touring sort of like as technical help or as you know, one of the guys eating cheese at the, at the opening. What, what was your role during that and, and how does all of that mesh? So that, and, and how are, and do you have discussions specifically about, you know, who's going to be credited where? I, I'm just curious because I've never worked on a, on a piece that's in any way like this, so I'm curious about how it works. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Yeah, I mean, that's, you know, kind of a great and tough question. It, it's, it's very nebulous. We, we approached this from the beginning as a collaborative process, but, the company is basically Phil Salt <span style="color:red" data-ts="1635.94" data-end_ts="1636.16" title="1635.94" id=c_"1635.94">__off__</span> company. Phil Salt <span style="color:red" data-ts="1637.8" data-end_ts="1638.08" title="1637.8" id=c_"1637.8">__Enough__</span>, just does these crazy shows. He, he does, what he calls it is Post-Human Theater or something like that. But, you know, that that was something that is, that is something that is, that is discussed is like credit credit and how, how that all works. So some, some of the festivals, it would be credited as a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1664.62" data-end_ts="1665.04" title="1664.62" id=c_"1664.62">__Senoff__</span> show. And actually a couple times we did it in, we did it, in conjunction with another show. So it was two shows of Senoff and, but then there were other festivals where it was Phil <span style="color:red" data-ts="1678.04" data-end_ts="1678.24" title="1678.04" id=c_"1678.04">__Salt__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1678.3" data-end_ts="1678.52" title="1678.3" id=c_"1678.3">__Off__</span> Ramirez's, Joe DE's show. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>So it really was, it's just kind of comes down to the, you know, the producers of the show, the presenters of the show, rather, how they want to, you know, how they want to present things. I, I guess the real thing is that you just have to, you know, you just have to have trust. And, Phil is somebody that I've worked with many times in the past, and he's, he's a bit of a mentor to me, and I really have learned a lot from working with him. So, it's, I trust, I trusted that whatever, however he would be able to, that he would do whatever he, he could to get my name, you know, in the credits. Sometimes it was not necessarily, feasible due to the way that the shows were being presented. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I would think that in a lot of cases, whether it's shows or, you know, in, in other kind of scenarios, galleries or, or museums or whatever, I think a lot of times those places really want, want it attached to a person because then they can sort of, they can market the personality. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Right. And that's sort of what it is. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1752.63" data-end_ts="1752.92" title="1752.63" id=c_"1752.63">__Yeah__</span>. It's, that's interesting. And, and at the same time it's, it's, it's gotta feel kind of weird, but 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Oh, oh, absolutely. I mean, it's, you know, I, I can't say that that this was, was not an issue, but, it, you know, with art, you're, you know, you're dealing with so many egos, right? Politics, so much money, or lack of money. So it's, it's kind of all, all these sort of things swirling around. I am not someone that thrives on that, like other people do. I definitely just want to like, do my thing. I love, I love getting credit. I love having my name in the New York Times, all that shit, but I, definitely, am not going to like, you know, be dramatic about it. But yeah, it does. It, it's a, it's a thing for sure. So, like I say, I, I feel like it really comes down to trust. You have to trust the people that you're working with. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Now, to what extent is in this kind of scenario, do you find that the people for whom it's important that they know you were involved have figured it out? You know, I mean, either because sort of like, 'cause you're based in the kind of New York Tech art scene, you know, so the assumption, I guess, and maybe my vision of it is wrong, but it just seems like even though it's a big city, it's still a small community. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Oh, for sure. You know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And so everybody kind of knows what everybody else is working on. And is there some satisfaction <span style="color:red" data-ts="1853.3" data-end_ts="1853.5" title="1853.3" id=c_"1853.3">__in__</span> just knowing that everybody knows that you worked on that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Well, it's definitely, a lot of satisfaction came, was, the New York Premier of that show was, part of this festival called Coil. Coil Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>And Coil Festival, that's kind of a big deal, especially in the very kind of small insular, downtown New York theater community, and, performing arts community. So we, we were, you know, we were a part of that. That was the show where, you know, my name was definitely on the, you know, on the, on the credits as creator of the show, one of the creators of the show. And that's where all my friends got to see the show. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1897.4" data-end_ts="1897.62" title="1897.4" id=c_"1897.4">__Ah__</span>, sure. And that, that was, that was really special to me because that's where you get, like, people just like, 'cause you know, I've been working on this show for like three years or whatever it was, and no, you know, nobody had really got to see it <laugh>. And to actually have people just like, you know, tell me how much they love the show. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Because it's a weird show. It's like, not, it's not an easy show. It's not a show that just like, you know, is easy to digest and just like blows you away. It, it requires a lot of, it requires a lot from the viewer to audience member. But, that being said, to, to have like, you know, close friends of mine that to come see that show and just like, you know, really get into it was, was super cool. I guess that's what I care about <laugh>, as long as those people know that I, you know, that my work, you know, that, appre no one appreciate my work, then that's really all I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1953.1" data-end_ts="1953.3" title="1953.1" id=c_"1953.1">__did__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That makes sense. So let's talk a little bit about this aesthetic. 'cause you say that, this piece in particular requires a lot of work from the audience. What, can you, can you unpack that a little bit? What exactly are you, are you describing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Well, I mean, I, there's a, there's few, there's a few levels to that. Because there, there are few levels to the show. You know, on, on the surface level, it's just going in there and it's about 50 minutes, 55 minutes of, of this, this same thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, so it takes stamina. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>It takes a little bit of stamina. The, the funny thing is, what happens is if you're able to last, through the fir it's, it's basically, it's split up into like five episodes, and there's a few interludes in between. Okay. And it's, it's this, video of Shatner on a, on a tv, on a Stand with wheels, and inside this very minimal, stage setting. And it's, there's a performer who, who sort of access his conduit or whatever, and she, she kind of, you know, moves the TV around and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2023.72" data-end_ts="2023.92" title="2023.72" id=c_"2023.72">__this__</span>, these very, choreographed patterns on the stage. But what happens, and, and then there's subtitles. So what happens is after about 15 minutes or whatever, 10, 15 minutes of watching it, you know, you, it's like, it's like having a friend that has a really strong accent. You understand it better, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>You under, you know, you get into the pacing and things like that. And I mean, that's, that's stuff that I like really worked hard on was like the pacing of, of, of how he talks. It's very difficult initially. But it's also kind of hilarious. So I think that's what, what really, like kept people in their seats was that, it's really funny. But then he gets into, you know, the text itself, which was written by our other collaborator, Joe Des is just kind of goes crazy places. It's really smart, the the way that he kind of structured this piece. And, you know, he, we basically, we wanted this, this, character. He's like, he's from the future, so he's, he's coming from the future to talk to us about art and technology, art and science and, and the future. And so, like, there's no answer to that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>I mean, if that is even a question, I'm, I'm not sure, but there's no, like, so it's, it was like really, really clever way that he, took that kind of really difficult topic and created this very kind of structured five act lecture, about art and technology, and was able to sort of wrap in the fact that it was William Shatner or William Shatner asterisk rather. And the fact that, you know, language is, you know, the lang the words are, so the piece is all language, but it's very difficult sort of thing to understand. And then the fact that it's very difficult to sort of describe these high-minded concepts with the words that we have, right? The words are not enough's, basically what, where it sort of landed. So yeah, I mean, that's, that's sort of where the difficulty was. But I feel like it's very rewarding. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, and so let's talk about the flip side of it then. What are the things that you did to sort of like accommodate the people in a room? Because to me, that's always a really important part of any sort of like, artistic presentation is if it's going to have an, if it's gonna be the kind of thing that has an audience as opposed to like, you know, the kind of art that you drive past. Right. You know, if it's something that's, that's going to have some sort of presentation or performance level, I'm always interested to see how people acknowledge the audience in the room, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Right? Yeah, that's, that's totally true. You know, this is, this is all where sort of Phil came in as the director and as the, as the person who, he, he's a person who has just like a really, really, kind of incredible relationship with time and space, and the way he uses that and thinks about it. And so, you know, the first thing is we have these two giant, subtitle screens on either side. And that was sort of very important to just like, let, you know, allow the audience to, to come into our world. Right. And, and, you know, there was a, like I said, there was a performer who I, I, I sort of thought of her as, like I said, kind of his conduit or, or his, his, assistant or whatever. And, you know, she, she was sort of there to sort of punctuate things. So certain points that were being made, there would be sort of a, a little kind of, step that she would take or something like that. And, and so we, you know, we sort of built up this rhythm of things. And so we, you know, we use sort of like musical elements and dance elements to, to, accentuate things, to highlight sort of repetition. And, you know, all those elements are sort of more accessible things for, for people to, to grasp and to sort of let them into our world. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. How, how important was it, how important was it to have that human in the room, the person that you described as like the conduit? Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>I, I think it's, I think it's incredibly important. I am, I'm, I'm just a little bit turned off by performance that doesn't involve humans, <laugh>, <laugh>. I, I sort of have a, a style I guess you would call it, or, or fascination or <span style="color:red" data-ts="2323.6" data-end_ts="2323.72" title="2323.6" id=c_"2323.6">__a__</span> form that I'm sort of interested in, which I guess is more like puppetry. And this, this piece was one example of that. I've, I've got a, a couple others that, that are, are similar where it's, it's video or sound or whatever, that, and, and, you know, and controlled by a human. And to me, that's, that's basically just what puppetry is, where instead of it's, you know, instead of this physical medium, it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2352.84" data-end_ts="2352.96" title="2352.84" id=c_"2352.84">__a__</span> digital medium. But, I, I, you know, I feel the human performer is absolutely necessary for that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure, sure. That makes sense. First question is, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2365.26" data-end_ts="2365.48" title="2365.26" id=c_"2365.26">__are__</span>, is this show done forever or is this something that'll be, brought out and, and shown again in the future? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>I would love for it to be brought out and shown in the future, really. I'm not sure. I can't, I don't know. Okay. The, the, if the show itself is done, then what, what I can say is that <span style="color:red" data-ts="2389.06" data-end_ts="2389.28" title="2389.06" id=c_"2389.06">__we__</span>, we all want to, to have a, we basically want to make a, like an installation version of the show, which I think would be really cool. And I have some ideas about that. We've, we've talked to a few people about how we can get that produced, but, well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And then you could do a sequel with William Shatner doing segments of TJ Hooker. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Exactly right. <laugh>. Well, Phil's, Phil's dream was to have it be a, to actually be a, like a, a, a conference of, of people Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2423.3" data-end_ts="2423.52" title="2423.3" id=c_"2423.3">__In__</span> like a group session or something like that. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's fantastic. So, what are kind of other, what kind of stuff are you doing? What have you been doing since then? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>I, I've done a few more kind of explorations of this puppetry idea. I had this piece where I, this was for a group show, where, I used connect to sort of capture all these images of a performer. And, and then I was sort of in another room and, people would come in, it was, it was another, it was this one-on-one type thing, and they would kind of put on these headphones and pick up a microphone, and they would ask questions of this thing. And then myself and another, and another performer went in another room, and they would sort of answer the questions. And this character was sort of like a Buddha or priestess type character. So it was sort of like a therapy session type thing, but with this very, tech, you know, this very sort of, this mix of sort of tech and like candles in the room and incense playing and, you know, trying to, use sort of Buddhist, sayings to, to answer these questions. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>So that, that was kind of a fun show. It was pretty interesting. But, I also am going to be, collaborating with another friend of mine who does, what he calls new toy theater, where he actually, he builds these, these kind of, these sets and uses like Act action figures and does these sort of really hilarious, kind of, political shows about con consumerism and things like that. And, but he does these, he does it as sort of like a one <span style="color:red" data-ts="2544.7" data-end_ts="2544.92" title="2544.7" id=c_"2544.7">__man__</span> show where he is, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2549.11" data-end_ts="2549.59" title="2549.11" id=c_"2549.11">__operate__</span>, operating cameras, doing the voices, moving the puppets around, and, you know, controlling these different sets. It's sort of like an exercise in, I mean, it's, it's sort of like this thing that just, you, you, his struggle is part of the show. Like, it's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. I was gonna say, it's, it's almost like one of those behind the scenes kind of a thing, but done performatively. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Yeah. And it's, I love his, I love his work, but it kills me every time because I'm, I'm the nerd that, like, I, you know, I'm, I have nightmares about that kind of stuff. I used to have night when I was DJing a lot, I used to have nightmares about like, what, you know, trying to find the record and I can't find the record. And like, I see him just like tripping over wires, and I'm just like, oh, God, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2596.21" data-end_ts="2596.43" title="2596.21" id=c_"2596.21">__do__</span> you just get, get a tech person to help you with that 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>But no, it's fascinating how he, how he pulls it all off. So we're, we're gonna work on something together. And I'm pretty excited about that. 'cause it's a, that's a totally different aesthetic from, you know, working with Phil or doing the other shows that I've done, so. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Well, that sounds really interesting and fun, and, hopefully that's something that, that people get a chance to, to review. Now, let's, for one more second, let's go back to the world of three D that you occupy in your Max World. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. So when I tend to think of OpenGL and three D graphics, I tend to think of these beautifully rendered three D scenes or, heavily, you know, heavily described moving functions. And the way that you use it inside of a max is really kind of different. You hook up some numbers, you hook up a sensor to it, and you waggle the sensor and boxes or models move around mm-hmm. <affirmative>, it seems to me like, like what you do in Max is sort of at odds with what is typical in OpenGL. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Sure. I mean, if we're talking of like, people that do three D modeling with Maya or whatever, it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2680.64" data-end_ts="2680.8" title="2680.64" id=c_"2680.64">__all__</span> offline rendered and Right. You know, beautiful, beautiful, material effects and lights and shadows and all this stuff. Yeah. I mean, I think, you have to approach it a different way. And, you know, you see, you know, you see people like Andrew Benson, what he does. It's basically embracing, and I think it's the same thing with the audio side out. You know, you always hear people talk about embracing the, digital quality or embracing, you know, whatever aspects of live audio, or digital audio or whatever. I think it's the same thing with the, the OpenGL is you, you have to sort of embrace that aesthetic a little bit. You're not going to be producing these, Pixar quality renders with Jitter. But what you are gonna be able to do is create sort of more impressionistic style. And like I said, Andrew does <span style="color:red" data-ts="2738.41" data-end_ts="2738.53" title="2738.41" id=c_"2738.41">__a__</span>, another friend of mine that works a lot with Connect has a really, Matt Roma. He has this really interesting, style that he created with, with Jitter and, and the Connect image that doesn't look like anything I've ever seen. And so I think that's, it's more about sort of individual creative expression, with Jitter. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So for people that might want to give it a try, what are the things that you think represent, you know, a an appropriate, an an appropriate approach to take? You know, because like I teach, I teach in an art school mm-hmm. <affirmative>, and a lot of times people that come into my, visual programming class, we have already spent three years doing modeling in Maya. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Oh, I see. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And so they have a very specific view of how, you know, how you, you do materials and you apply materials and shading and, and, shadows and mirroring and all these kind of things are really important because that's the stuff that working in Maya made, you know, sort of like preference. You could do that really well. And so you tended to do that, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Right? Yeah. And then, and I, I think if you, if you know, especially to that crew, take a model that you built in Maya and export it and bring it into Max and then just start playing with like the, the, the stuff that you can do with the three D modeling. I, I feel like is still such an unexplored territory. There's only a few people that I, that I've really seen like, do like start like pushing those, those boundaries of, you know, manipulating, manipulating those three D models and, you know, exporting animations and then bringing them in and, and doing, you know, you can blend between animations. You, you can do all this crazy stuff. And just, you know, I, I think you, you're, you're going to want to kind of like shed a lot of those, sort of preconceived ideas of what three D rendering is about when you start playing with, with it in jitter and just start playing with animation and, and plugging sound files into the, into the texture or something like that. And like warping and, all these things that are such sort of an integral part of Max. So I think there's like a whole world of, of play that you, that people that do three D modeling would, benefit from. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, one of the things I always like to ask people, especially people like yourself who are in both the art world and you know, heavily into art world and heavily into the technology world, what I like to ask is, what do you see as the future? Or what do you hope is the future 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b><laugh>? Oh, man, that's such a bad question for me because I, I'm so much not a forward looking person. You're

<b>Darwin: </b>Not, you're not a future boy. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2928.27" data-end_ts="2928.39" title="2928.27" id=c_"2928.27">__am__</span> not. I am so, like stuck in, you know, things that are, that are already there and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2936.05" data-end_ts="2936.27" title="2936.05" id=c_"2936.05">__try__</span>, you know, like I, I really don't feel like I have explored enough with the tools that I already have. So it's tricky for me. I think it's more, accessibility. I mean, that's been the, the trend. It's just like these tools, you know, things like the connect that prior to the Connect, it was a $10,000 time of flight camera or something like that, whatever the, the depth cameras that you had to buy before you had the, the connect, you know? Right, right. It's like when the connect came out that became accessible. The Arduino, the same thing when the Arduino came out, that whole world of physical computing became accessible. And I think that's just more and more the trend, whatever this like $9 little mini computer that we were just sort of passing around in our internal cycling forums, the links to that. I mean, that, that's awesome. Like that, that stuff's really cool. So, you know, the more that these tools become accessible to people, I think, the more exciting things are gonna come out. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I especially think that's true, given that the red, greater accessibility through reduction cost actually then opens the door for work like this to not just be a first world art. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Right? Yeah, exactly. I mean, that's, that's really what's gonna be interesting when kids in high school or whatever, you are, are gonna start playing with this stuff and having access to this. Yeah. Not no longer a first world art. That's, that's could not be said better. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Yeah. That's, that's a really kind of cool, future to think about. So <span style="color:red" data-ts="3039.47" data-end_ts="3039.76" title="3039.47" id=c_"3039.47">__here__</span> you were, future boy, after all, <laugh> hooray <laugh>. Well, Rob, I want to thank you so much for taking the time to talk to us. It was really fun. I will be putting up some, links on the art music tech.libson.com, podcast site for people that want to check out some of the things that we were talking about. But I also want to take, thank you for being willing to jump back and forth between art talk and tech talk. That's, that's sort of like how I tend to live, and it's always fun to talk to someone else about it as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Absolutely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>All right, man, thanks a lot and we'll talk to you soon. Thanks 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Darwin Take care. Bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And there it is, another week in a bag. I want to thank everybody for their continued listenership. We just hit a kind of a listenership milestone over the weekend, and it's pretty exciting to see the number of people that are, listening to this show. I want to also thank the 80 previous guests of the show and the, this, the 81st, for giving us a really great ride. Hopefully we're gonna continue with more great numbers over the years and hopefully I'm gonna keep on doing this over the years as well. Make sure you tell your friends, families, enemies, frenemies, whatever, to listen to this podcast available through iTunes. I'm sure Android's got something that allows you to listen to podcasts, but always available through our primary podcast website at art <span style="color:red" data-ts="3140.36" data-end_ts="3140.64" title="3140.36" id=c_"3140.36">__music__</span> tech dot lipson, l i b s y n.com.
