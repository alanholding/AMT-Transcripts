<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, today I have, two very special guests. I actually got contacted by a PR firm that represents them, with some information. I went out and checked it out, and I got pretty excited. I got excited because these are two people that you've probably heard of. One is Jesse Carmichael, who's a keyboardist guitarist, and vocalist with Maroon Five. The other is Jason <span style="color:red" data-ts="34.495" data-end_ts="34.845" title="34.495" id=c_"34.495">__later__</span> who's got a list of production and engineering and programming credits As long as my driveway, these two guys have come together and done, and released an EP under the name The Circuit Jerks And the way it was presented to me was that here's a band that's focused on modular synthesizers and doing some interesting stuff. So I listened to the record and it started off with kind of a very funky, weird, chip toy, re remix of Aro Five Tune, and then it kind of another standard remix, and then it sort of took off into left field. There's a remix of Aquila to Brazil by Ari Barroso, which, was just ridiculously fun. And then in inexplicably there are two one hour long form, sort of ambient pieces that were just mesmerizing. And so, given what I heard, I, I really wanted to talk to these guys, talk about how they came up with the idea for this release and how their collaboration works. So with that, I'm gonna say hi to Jesse Carmichael. Hi. 
</p>

<p>
<b>The Circuit Jerks: </b>Hello. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm great. And hi to Jason later. 
</p>

<p>
<b>The Circuit Jerks: </b>Hello. Hello. Hello. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, thanks so much guys for taking time outta your busy schedules to talk. Now I'm gonna start off, first of all, with you, Jesse. You obviously have a long history doing the work with Maroon five. I noticed that you did some studying of, of music, but I'm curious what caused you to kind of take a break from working on the really straight stuff to do some what I would consider kind of very experi experimental stuff with this Circuit jerks project? 
</p>

<p>
<b>The Circuit Jerks: </b>Well, I love all kinds of music, so it doesn't feel like a stretch to go into different realms. And I got introduced to the Modular synth by Jason later, back in 2005 when he was helping us make our second album with <span style="color:red" data-ts="159.605" data-end_ts="159.845" title="159.605" id=c_"159.605">__Moon__</span> five. He brought a modular synth up to the Houdini mansion in Laurel Canyon where we were recording, and I was interested in it, but it didn't really catch with me until years later. And Jason was building up his modular sim library along with some other friends of, of ours. And I just suddenly got interested in it again and started putting together my own rig and we started making music together. And it naturally led to the first remix we did for maps. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. Yeah. And of, of the stuff on the release, that was probably the most straightforward remix After that though, then you did, the remix of this summer, which <laugh> I happened to check it out on, check out on YouTube, and it really kind of threw a lot of people for a loop because they were, they weren't expecting something as aggressive as that. And so was this a chance for you to sort of like stretch your, stretch your legs into a kind of new possibilities? Or were you actually trying to like kind of push the fans a little bit? 
</p>

<p>
<b>The Circuit Jerks: </b>I think it was just something we were doing to have fun. We didn't have any intentions of trying to push people's ears in a certain direction. It was just what was naturally sounding cool to us. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Okay. Jason, I want to talk with you a little bit about this. Since you started in 2005, the modular world wasn't quite the utopia of gear that is now, it was relatively, relatively few manufacturers developing relatively few systems. What, what was it about the modular at the time that really drew you in? 
</p>

<p>
<b>The Circuit Jerks: </b>I was always into synthesizers. And you know, when you're a kid, you know, you see all the pictures of modulars and the fantasy, you know, watching, Phantom of the Paradise and Toto and Right. Tonto, excuse me. And, you know, all the, all the pictures of, you know, I was really into Pink Floyd, so you see all the pictures of <span style="color:red" data-ts="287.305" data-end_ts="287.525" title="287.305" id=c_"287.305">__the__</span> VVCS threes and we were really into modes and stuff. So I think there reached a point where, I guess, you know, also, so then at that point, Radiohead, like Johnny started using a lot of modular stuff, right? And so I got turned through him. It was like I started seeing pictures of the analog system stuff and I was intrigued to get a system. And there's a place out here called Analog Haven at the time they were in Pomona. So I drove out there one day and bought my first starter system, which as you say, you know, things were more basic back then. It was really just kind of a modern version of the classic modular sym, you know, it was all very traditional synthesizer module. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>The Circuit Jerks: </b>Which was cool, but it wasn't, it wasn't what it is now, which, you know, fast forward 10 years later and all these new more interesting modules started to, came out a lot more experimental stuff. So that's when I really dove in and really started building that system up. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, so what are the things that are kind of like the hallmark pieces of modular gear that you, that you use? What are the things that you go to every time? 
</p>

<p>
<b>The Circuit Jerks: </b>I mean, I use everything that I have <laugh>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="364.165" data-end_ts="364.285" title="364.165" id=c_"364.165">__I__</span>, I've, like <span style="color:red" data-ts="365.185" data-end_ts="365.405" title="365.185" id=c_"365.185">__the__</span>, the system that I have is, you know, everything. I don't, I don't think there's anything I don't use. And in fact, it's funny because the size of the system I have now, I thought like, okay, this is gonna be good for, for me for a while. But then I was on a session last month and I borrowed my friend Chris's system, which is about the same size as mine. So it's basically double. Right. And I loved, I loved having that, like, just that much more stuff and having doubles <span style="color:red" data-ts="397.725" data-end_ts="397.925" title="397.725" id=c_"397.725">__and__</span> modules. I really like, I mean, modules that I love, love are like to make noise stuff. The <span style="color:red" data-ts="404.045" data-end_ts="404.245" title="404.045" id=c_"404.045">__phono__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="404.245" data-end_ts="404.525" title="404.245" id=c_"404.245">__gene__</span>. Right. The <span style="color:red" data-ts="405.885" data-end_ts="406.005" title="405.885" id=c_"405.885">__a__</span> sequencer. I love my, probably my favorite module at the moment is the cloud. Oh yeah. Mutable Instruments. So I love that one. I love, I love all the mutable stuff. I love all the make noise stuff. I love the Mod <span style="color:red" data-ts="419.465" data-end_ts="419.685" title="419.465" id=c_"419.465">__Can__</span> stuff, which sadly they're not making anymore. Right. Like the dual delay I use a lot. The, the Quad <span style="color:red" data-ts="426.645" data-end_ts="428.245" title="426.645" id=c_"426.645">__LOI__</span> mean, you know, and it's like, you can't, it's funny 'cause those are like the, the important sonic models, but then it's like there's so many building blocks that you couldn't live without. Like all the basic stuff, you know, all the CV stuff and all the utility stuff is such a huge part of it, you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Know? Yeah. I almost, <span style="color:red" data-ts="443.745" data-end_ts="443.965" title="443.745" id=c_"443.745">__he__</span> hesitate to talk about, you know, what's a favorite module because in a real modular system you need about four modules to make everyone work, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>The Circuit Jerks: </b>Yeah, exactly. It's like, it's all about all of it. It's not like there's one, like, there's been Times <span style="color:red" data-ts="460.025" data-end_ts="460.245" title="460.025" id=c_"460.025">__for__</span> Sessions where I was like, oh, can I just pair it down <laugh> with like a few? And I can't really, because it's like, it's all having all the options and just getting patches and unexpected things together. And the whole thing about the complexity of the modules now is there's like endless discovery. A module like Intelli Shapeshifter, there's so many layers to it. And it's, you <span style="color:red" data-ts="485.005" data-end_ts="485.085" title="485.005" id=c_"485.005">__are__</span> always uncovering sounds <span style="color:red" data-ts="486.825" data-end_ts="487.045" title="486.825" id=c_"486.825">__in__</span> it and new ways of using it, you know, same with the clouds, with the parasites mode, like all the parasites from where there's all these different modes. So you, you start discovering all these new sounds. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>The Circuit Jerks: </b>And that, that to me is what was, what's so much more interesting about it now is <span style="color:red" data-ts="502.155" data-end_ts="502.645" title="502.155" id=c_"502.155">__suppose__</span> before when it was more just traditional synthesis, now it's like, it's so much more complex and so much more interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, Jesse, what does your modular rig look like? What kind of setup do you have? 
</p>

<p>
<b>The Circuit Jerks: </b>I got something similar to Jason. I just started to add some more video modules into my rig from LZX, and I'm excited about getting to that. I wanna talk more about your video piece that you made and how you did it. Will you tell us about that for 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>A little bit? Well, so for the listeners, I kind of always have a couple of ideas sort of in the back of my head that I'm working on in terms of trying to do video stuff. I try and develop like video concepts. When I was listening to this ep, the nice thing about the EP one is that it's got these very long, long form pieces. The last two pieces, mod <span style="color:red" data-ts="552.525" data-end_ts="552.805" title="552.525" id=c_"552.525">__Fire__</span> and, 
</p>

<p>
<b>The Circuit Jerks: </b>Spring. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. And, but Mod Fire, I put, I put it on and I was just like, oh man, this reminds me a lot, kind of the, the repetition, but the not exact repetition of it reminded me of this piece I'd been working on. So I like jumped into it. I, I work with Max all the time, right. I basically pulled out one of these patches that I'd been working on and just listening to that and sort of like, the way that that kind of caught my brain got me into a very specific part of the patch that I was like, oh, if I just tweak this, it'll do the right thing. And all <span style="color:red" data-ts="589.965" data-end_ts="590.005" title="589.965" id=c_"589.965">__of__</span> a sudden it just kind of blossomed. And it was one of those things that I love when I'm working with video and audio simultaneously. Your brain really tries hard to like make the two match up, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And so it was, it was really great to then see this thing that kind of moved in a way that it was, that my brain was quickly attaching to parts of the music. Cool. And that was, that's always like a really good sign when that happens. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>The Circuit Jerks: </b>That's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Nice. Now, I'm, I'm interested though to, to think about, what you might be doing with some of that LZX stuff. I've had a chance to play with it a couple of times. I don't own any myself, but, I've had a chance to play with them. And it is a completely mind-bending way of working with visuals. 
</p>

<p>
<b>The Circuit Jerks: </b>I was gonna say, I have a piece from, there, it's called the Sensory Translator. And that allows you to take certain frequencies and plug them into the visual cortex, and then whatever's showing up on the projector screen will react to the sound that's in that frequency range. So if you put it low and there's a kick drum happening, and every time the kick drum happens, there'll be a ripple of color and lines across the image that's being projected. So I like what you're saying about how you're looking for these connections, and it's one of my favorite things too, is seeing images react to sound in real time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. And, and what's fun is, is especially with the analog stuff, I think very similar to way the analog audio works, the analog video has some really unique characteristics in that it, it isn't always a hundred percent pure mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And there's something about that lack of purity that makes it seem like it connects to our humanness more in some way. And I just, I've just always really liked that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>The Circuit Jerks: </b>Yeah. You know, the other day Jason and I were watching Frank Ocean's first video for Nike's. Right. And we had Fluxx turned on on the laptop, and it's that program that turns the blue light off and accentuates the orange hue right at night. But it introduces all these artifacts into the video that aren't necessarily there. But I didn't know that at the time. I just thought that was like some cool video art stuff. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's awesome. 
</p>

<p>
<b>The Circuit Jerks: </b>But yeah, for whatever reason, I think I am definitely Jason as well. Probably a lot of us are probably just drawn to things that look fucked up in some way. Right. I don't know what that means, you know, certain love of abnormality. Yeah. Or just, it's just, you know, more complexity, interesting things we've never seen or heard before, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Right. So, I'm curious about how you guys collaborate. 'cause first of all, Jesse, you're touring a lot. Jason, you are have gotta be going from studio, from studio to studio constantly. It's hard to imagine actually having the time to be able to put together a collaboration like this. How does, what is sort of like the way that you ma that you manufacture the work? 
</p>

<p>
<b>The Circuit Jerks: </b>Well, we, we have, we both have enough downtime to work on our own music and work on other stuff. So usually, we get together usually at Jesse's house in Los Angeles, because we all live here. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, just so you know, there, there's, there's a ghost member who's not part of this interview. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>The Circuit Jerks: </b>Well, the, well the group started with four of us. One of the other members is, or was, and his name's Andrew. <span style="color:red" data-ts="807.425" data-end_ts="807.645" title="807.425" id=c_"807.425">__She__</span>, and he's also a very successful mixer engineer. Right, yes. Producer in his own right. And, so he was part of it. He, he actually probably had, probably still has the biggest <span style="color:red" data-ts="820.485" data-end_ts="820.845" title="820.485" id=c_"820.485">__system__</span> in Wallace, but he wound up moving to England. So, that, that space was too much and Right. So, and then there's another member who is in another band that is like contractually obligated in a way. So he's, he basically ghost <span style="color:red" data-ts="839.005" data-end_ts="839.285" title="839.005" id=c_"839.005">__number__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>The Circuit Jerks: </b>He shall remain <span style="color:red" data-ts="840.765" data-end_ts="840.965" title="840.765" id=c_"840.765">__on__</span> <laugh>. So, but he also, you know, he's deep into the modular. He has a really great system. Anyway, so we all get together at Jesse's house and whatever project, you know, if it's a remix, we'll start, you know, with the remix. We've also been doing some shows. A friend of ours started doing an ambient music night in Los Angeles. And so we've done <span style="color:red" data-ts="864.455" data-end_ts="864.805" title="864.455" id=c_"864.455">__three__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="864.805" data-end_ts="865.085" title="864.805" id=c_"864.805">__shows__</span> thus far. Okay. And it's just basically improv, ambient, you know, like we, we just get our, we go with our <span style="color:red" data-ts="872.285" data-end_ts="872.485" title="872.285" id=c_"872.285">__three__</span> modular systems and play for crowd. We've done some rehearsals for that stuff. So yeah, we just, you know, it's, we just make the time and, you know, it's fun. And then usually there's some, some goal in mind when we get together. Some, some project, you know, that it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="891.165" data-end_ts="891.205" title="891.165" id=c_"891.165">__a__</span> remix or one of these shows. That's usually what's gotten us together. Sure. Thus far. Though coming in the future, Jesse's just fi finished finishing building a really beautiful recording studio <span style="color:red" data-ts="903.425" data-end_ts="903.645" title="903.425" id=c_"903.425">__in__</span> his house. So I'm sure there will be more creative, just like, you know, off the cuff things happening and, you <span style="color:red" data-ts="911.005" data-end_ts="911.125" title="911.005" id=c_"911.005">__know__</span>, some more projects, some more stuff to release. So. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. So when you, when you either do these get together, sessions or when you play live, do you have like a reduced version of your synth that you take with you? Or do you take the whole rig <laugh>? 
</p>

<p>
<b>The Circuit Jerks: </b>No, we take, we take it all 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>The Circuit Jerks: </b>And <span style="color:red" data-ts="933.965" data-end_ts="934.085" title="933.965" id=c_"933.965">__now__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="934.085" data-end_ts="934.365" title="934.085" id=c_"934.085">__look__</span>, it got me, that's what got me thinking about the future of like online streaming audio and video concerts. And I'm wondering how we could link up our systems with clock over distance, right. So that we're all connected. It's gotta be <span style="color:red" data-ts="950.205" data-end_ts="950.565" title="950.205" id=c_"950.205">__somewhere__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="950.565" data-end_ts="950.725" title="950.565" id=c_"950.565">__either__</span> that way to do that. Yeah. Well, I mean, yes. Just there, there <span style="color:red" data-ts="955.045" data-end_ts="955.365" title="955.045" id=c_"955.045">__never__</span> is some sort of sort of latency over online. So there's gonna be, <span style="color:red" data-ts="961.185" data-end_ts="961.405" title="961.185" id=c_"961.185">__it__</span> would never be able to be perfectly in time. Well actually though, if you had, sorry. If you had clock generated from the web and we were all getting clock and not without, like if someone wasn't <span style="color:red" data-ts="974.365" data-end_ts="974.805" title="974.365" id=c_"974.365">__generating__</span> Clock Getting Clock, we might be able to get it in sync somehow. That'd be an interesting website to develop like a clock generating website for people. Oh, that's a great idea. Yeah. Link <span style="color:red" data-ts="985.965" data-end_ts="986.085" title="985.965" id=c_"985.965">__up__</span>. Oh my God. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Have you guys played around with, with Ableton's Link system yet? 
</p>

<p>
<b>The Circuit Jerks: </b>Yeah, it's great. It's amazing. And I've just had a very, I went to the a ES show last week in LA Yeah. Audio Engineering Society and, a friend of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1001.805" data-end_ts="1001.965" title="1001.805" id=c_"1001.805">__mine__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1002.335" data-end_ts="1002.685" title="1002.335" id=c_"1002.335">__leggy__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1002.685" data-end_ts="1002.845" title="1002.685" id=c_"1002.685">__and__</span> like a mixer uhhuh engineer I know out here, we, we've been having very lengthy discussions about, 'cause we all use multiple systems. Like I use Pro Tools, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1013.025" data-end_ts="1013.245" title="1013.025" id=c_"1013.025">__he__</span> Ableton, I use Logic, he uses Logic and Pro Tools cubase. And so it's, there's always this thing about like, in this day and age with all the technology, why don't these things talk to each other better? Like, rewire is great, but Rewire <span style="color:red" data-ts="1027.605" data-end_ts="1027.725" title="1027.605" id=c_"1027.605">__is__</span> like 20 years old now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and it seems so fragile. 
</p>

<p>
<b>The Circuit Jerks: </b>Yeah. And it's very fragile and it's just, it's very strange because to me, like I know probably a lot of it was out of fear of like, like companies not want, like they want to be, their <span style="color:red" data-ts="1043.385" data-end_ts="1043.605" title="1043.385" id=c_"1043.385">__use__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1043.605" data-end_ts="1043.805" title="1043.605" id=c_"1043.605">__is__</span> exclusive, but to me, the way people work now, like everybody likes different parts of every software <laugh> and software's gotten for the most part more affordable. So to me, if they made it easier to use together, I think more people would just be like, cool, I'll have <span style="color:red" data-ts="1058.085" data-end_ts="1058.325" title="1058.085" id=c_"1058.085">__Crow__</span> Tools and Logic <span style="color:red" data-ts="1059.315" data-end_ts="1059.605" title="1059.315" id=c_"1059.315">__able__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1059.805" data-end_ts="1060.085" title="1059.805" id=c_"1059.805">__phenomenal__</span> use them all at the same time. 'cause I like that drum machine, I like that sampler. But instead they're making it difficult and so people have to stay more exclusive because it's such a hassle to use multiple things. Right. And so like the link thing, which I've just read now has become open source. Yeah. I read that the other day is amazing. And I'm hoping that like, I know Reason just picked up on it. So I'm hoping that virtual tools and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1085.175" data-end_ts="1085.525" title="1085.175" id=c_"1085.175">__logic__</span>, I hope more people pick up on that. 'cause that's a, a great, I've used it in the studio and it's such a great way of collaborating. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. I know ableton's been really great at kind of evangelizing that as sort of like a timing system. Yeah. I know at cycling <span style="color:red" data-ts="1100.915" data-end_ts="1101.205" title="1100.915" id=c_"1100.915">__semi__</span> four, we just got done with, we're just finishing up a development run, that's specifically oriented towards supporting Link. And so, you know, if, if that could work, the other thing is though it still is kind of oriented towards everyone being on the same like local network, Uhhuh, <affirmative>, it would be nice if that would like extend out to the whole internet so that you could do something like your centralized website that everyone logs into and works off of. That would be pretty amazing. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>The Circuit Jerks: </b>But like, I really, I hope that catches on because the fact that you can't just go between systems and all of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1139.765" data-end_ts="1139.925" title="1139.765" id=c_"1139.765">__this__</span> crazy.

I've been really intrigued by Max MT for a long time, though. I've never had the luxury of really learning.

</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I do. I I used to have a much larger modular system, but for me, I found out, I found that for myself, I prefer, live performance to recording. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And so what I ended up doing was, like getting hyper-focused on a small portable system. So I have one of these little tiptop fold open cases. 
</p>

<p>
<b>The Circuit Jerks: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1189.145" data-end_ts="1189.365" title="1189.145" id=c_"1189.145">__Yep__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And, I said, I'm gonna find, I'm gonna find a way to do what I want with a laptop and one of those and a controller, right? Yeah. I've got, I've got this thing. It's, it's actually like two and a half voices of, synthesis. And then, I, I have it kind of talking back and forth to my laptop a lot. I sometimes I use the mutable instruments yarns for CV <span style="color:red" data-ts="1218.325" data-end_ts="1218.445" title="1218.325" id=c_"1218.325">__to__</span> midi. Oh, that's cool. And sometimes I use, sometimes I use either the mono, button interface or else I'll use the expert sleepers to, so I can control it more easily between, stuff. So, you know, I swap things in and out, but really I limit myself to this one small case so that it's very easily easy for me to travel. 
</p>

<p>
<b>The Circuit Jerks: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But, at the same time, it means that there are certain, like I love the phone machine, module as well, but it's so big that it's really impractical to put it in a small case. Right. And so, as much as I love it, I instead wrote sort of the equivalent in Max so I could at least have something like that. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But, you know, it's one of those things where there are limits that come with having a small system and not all of those limits are great. 
</p>

<p>
<b>The Circuit Jerks: </b>Well, yeah. Yeah. No, I mean, sometimes <span style="color:red" data-ts="1272.005" data-end_ts="1272.125" title="1272.005" id=c_"1272.005">__a__</span> limitation is good though, right? You're like forced to <span style="color:red" data-ts="1275.145" data-end_ts="1275.365" title="1275.145" id=c_"1275.145">__use__</span> things in different ways. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What I find was that with a really limited system, what it means is that I, I more often will explore like the weirdo edges of different modules because if I have a huge wall of modules, I kind of do what each module does best. Right. Right, right. But if I have a really small collection, I'm just sort of like, well, this thing doesn't do FM that well, but you know what, it kind of has this quirky thing way on the edge, so I'm gonna play with that for a while. And, and that's kind of a nice way to go. 
</p>

<p>
<b>The Circuit Jerks: </b>Yeah, I feel you. And that's why I was trying to keep my system to what I have now. Right. But then I had that experience of borrowing my friends and I was like, oh man, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. The the double <span style="color:red" data-ts="1315.695" data-end_ts="1316.045" title="1315.695" id=c_"1315.695">__uncle__</span> always.

Right. And, I had my modular set up in the control room at the time. He walks in and he is like, oh, I've got, I've got some of that stuff. I was like, oh, you do? Oh, cool.

<p>
<b>The Circuit Jerks: </b>He hasn't insane <span style="color:red" data-ts="1363.755" data-end_ts="1364.045" title="1363.755" id=c_"1363.755">__seen__</span> <laugh>. So I, yeah.

Yeah, exactly. Where we, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So let me ask a little bit, let me go back to the, to the EP because I am curious about one thing, these two long <span style="color:red" data-ts="1382.925" data-end_ts="1383.165" title="1382.925" id=c_"1382.925">__form__</span>, first of all, it must have been, it must have drove a record co company crazy to have you walk in with like two hour long pieces and say, here's part of our ep. Did they give you any crap about that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>The Circuit Jerks: </b>No. They were cool with it. And iTunes doesn't care either. Right. And, it was, we're all into like, kind of interesting esoteric ideas and all both of those pieces are one hour, 11 minutes and 11 seconds. Exactly. Right. So it was good for our first EP one that that number was repeated a bunch. Maybe the next <span style="color:red" data-ts="1415.285" data-end_ts="1415.565" title="1415.285" id=c_"1415.285">__week__</span> will have a bunch of two hour 22 minutes and 22 second long pieces. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I'll be looking forward to that. That's what's cool <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>The Circuit Jerks: </b>I've actually, I've been doing a lot of like, those are actually short. I've been doing a lot of two to three hour long pieces that I have up on my own personal SoundCloud that I've been experimenting with. I think it's nice when you could put on a piece of music. Like I think we were, we're both thinking <span style="color:red" data-ts="1439.245" data-end_ts="1439.445" title="1439.245" id=c_"1439.245">__this__</span>, like you could put on something, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1441.045" data-end_ts="1441.245" title="1441.045" id=c_"1441.045">__just__</span> have it, it's like becomes environmental in a sense, you know? Right. It's just like, and kind of the longer it is, you just forget about it and it just stays on. It creates like a mood, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and especially in both of those cases, there's, there's like these repeating figures, but there's also, over time there's modulation, whether it's a change in the noise floor or the change of the, of the structure of the tone or whatever. Yeah. There are these long form changes, but short term repetitions, and that has, I think that that has a real particular, thing that it does to our brain, which is it puts us into sort of a, a working rhythm that aligns with that in some way, you 
</p>

<p>
<b>The Circuit Jerks: </b>Know? Right. Yeah. Yeah. For sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And you know, I know for myself, when I jumped into working with this Max stuff then, I mean, I really found myself like changing LFOs to sort of like match some of the timings and stuff like that. And I think that's really, that's really great. I'm curious what is it? It's one thing for me to listen to it and align with it. It's another thing to make the decisions to say, here's what kind of thing we're doing. What was the determinant for how long these loop sections were, were you using tape loops? Were you using, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1519.485" data-end_ts="1519.525" title="1519.485" id=c_"1519.485">__Pho__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1519.635" data-end_ts="1519.925" title="1519.635" id=c_"1519.635">__gene__</span>? Were you using something that sort of limited the timeframes, or was it just like, this is what my gut tells me should work? 
</p>

<p>
<b>The Circuit Jerks: </b>It's, I think for us it's more, it's like on these long pieces, it's more about creating systems and there's no, like bring back probably a loop in Phono <span style="color:red" data-ts="1538.605" data-end_ts="1538.845" title="1538.605" id=c_"1538.605">__Gene__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1539.025" data-end_ts="1539.245" title="1539.025" id=c_"1539.025">__but__</span> that's being modulated in many random ways. So that never really repeats 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What, what it means is that you didn't overthink it. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>The Circuit Jerks: </b>Yeah. I, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1547.285" data-end_ts="1547.565" title="1547.285" id=c_"1547.285">__yeah__</span>, exactly. It's never, it's never really thought out. It's just like kind of patching <span style="color:red" data-ts="1552.165" data-end_ts="1552.285" title="1552.165" id=c_"1552.165">__in__</span> things until you're like, until you find something you like. And then again, for the long piece, it's just like, just changing things really slowly over time. Right. Like letting things go and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1563.965" data-end_ts="1564.085" title="1563.965" id=c_"1563.965">__then__</span>, you know, after 10 minutes, turning it off a little bit, you know, nothing drastic. And then the thing Yeah. Kind of for the last question, it's like, I'm surprised even our new medium, which, you know, we used to be limited by, you know, what an LP could hold or what a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1581.325" data-end_ts="1581.525" title="1581.325" id=c_"1581.325">__<inaudible>__</span> could hold. And then after that a cd. Right. And now with this new sort of streaming medium, that's relat, you know, it's relatively new. It's only in the last probably five or 10 years <span style="color:red" data-ts="1592.315" data-end_ts="1592.605" title="1592.315" id=c_"1592.315">__that__</span>, and even now, it's like really just that you can have it everywhere. 
</p>

<p>
<b>The Circuit Jerks: </b>It's like amazing to me that people <span style="color:red" data-ts="1599.065" data-end_ts="1599.285" title="1599.065" id=c_"1599.065">__so__</span> limited to these like three minute songs or 40 minute records, you know, it's like, why not explore like, like what's available with more lengthy, you know, it's like <span style="color:red" data-ts="1609.665" data-end_ts="1609.885" title="1609.665" id=c_"1609.665">__you__</span>, there's no limit to what you can do now. Yeah. That's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1613.325" data-end_ts="1613.445" title="1613.325" id=c_"1613.325">__what__</span> that starts to get us into the like, long now foundation territory with those epic, you know, year long works. Right, right. Exactly. That's exciting stuff. And that's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1624.565" data-end_ts="1624.685" title="1624.565" id=c_"1624.565">__where__</span> I think AI is gonna come into play, because if we can start brain mapping our brains to have computers make music with our neurological processes, that'll be really interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Dude, I, it used to be that this long form stuff, it was really the only time you could ever experience it was if you went to, to a live show. I remember when I was much younger, I went to a Robert Rich show and he used to do these things. He'd call 'em sleep concerts. Oh yeah. And you would come with your sleeping bag and he would start at like 10 o'clock at night and he would finish at nine the next morning. All one enormous long piece. 
</p>

<p>
<b>The Circuit Jerks: </b>Max Richter's been doing that as well the last year. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. That kind of concept's coming back. But what's interesting, as you pointed out, now all of a sudden we actually have a distribution medium that conceivably allows us to send these things out. It's just everybody's still stuck on the single format in three and a half minutes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>The Circuit Jerks: </b>Yeah. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Totally. Very strange. Hopefully that will change slowly change over the next little bit of time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, I agree. 
</p>

<p>
<b>The Circuit Jerks: </b>I think as radio, radio becomes less important, which <span style="color:red" data-ts="1693.885" data-end_ts="1694.085" title="1693.885" id=c_"1693.885">__it__</span> kind of is, right. In a lot of ways that will happen, you know, what I'm imagining right now is a technology that would allow somebody while <span style="color:red" data-ts="1701.965" data-end_ts="1702.405" title="1701.965" id=c_"1701.965">__they're__</span> asleep to be hooked up to some sort of brain mechanism that would allow them to control the music from within their lucid dream. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's, that's where you're gonna really find out who is, who is creative and who just dreams about like, driving to work every day or whatever. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>The Circuit Jerks: </b><laugh>. Right. Exactly. <laugh>, where you said you like playing live. Are you doing modular shows then? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I, I am. Although I just recently moved from, I used to live up in the mountains outside of Boulder, Colorado. Oh, cool. And I just recently, I just recently moved here to Minneapolis, so, I just kind of have to reestablish new connections and stuff to start playing again. Oh, wow. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1742.225" data-end_ts="1742.445" title="1742.225" id=c_"1742.225">__And__</span> a lot of times if I do shows they would be kind of in conjunction with workshops or something because people loved having the opportunity to kind of check out Max and stuff too. Yeah. Because it's funny because Max has been around for 20 years, but it's almost like people, people are just now wrapping their heads around what they might be able to do with it. Right. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>The Circuit Jerks: </b>But it's almost like pop, like even pop music in a sense now <span style="color:red" data-ts="1766.545" data-end_ts="1766.765" title="1766.545" id=c_"1766.545">__is__</span> coming more around to what Max can do. You know, it's like, I mean, the way electronic music has taken over. Yeah. So things like modular synths and Max MSP, like, everyone's looking for that interesting different sound and you know, it used to be pedals on guitars. There's some new synthesizers, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1786.205" data-end_ts="1786.485" title="1786.205" id=c_"1786.205">__some__</span> new keyboard, and now it's getting more extreme. I think it's things like Max MSP and modular synths because everybody else is just using presets on, you know, their synths and Ableton and their logic or whatever. So every to to get different things, you're having to go to these more extreme boundaries. So I think people are more interested. And then, like you said, you have guys like Johnny Greenwood who are like using Maxim SP and Modular since publicly. So it's bringing, it's bringing those things to the forefront. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I actually think that it's, it's sort of like this multi-headed beast that, and it's like a combination of where pop music is going. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, but also where like, where like movie soundtracks are going. Yeah. And also the kind of soundtracks behind commercials. All of these things are taking sound design and pushing it to the front. You know, it used to be everybody was trying to get a better fender road sound than someone else. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> or a better 8 0 8 kick drum. And now it's like, who can do the most extreme drop? Or who can just like, poke your eyes out with an amazing base track or something. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know, this, this like pushing forward of sound design is kind of really interesting. Now, I'm curious, is that one of the reasons that you <span style="color:red" data-ts="1862.705" data-end_ts="1862.925" title="1862.705" id=c_"1862.705">__gr__</span> you both gravitate towards modular synth because there is sort of like no equivalent of a preset and so is that what draws you into the modular synth thing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>The Circuit Jerks: </b>Yeah, I think it's, it's like you hear these sounds that you get things that you would never get on the other way. For some reason, for me, software and I would think maybe Max MSP or something like Reactor might lend more to this, but for some reason, like in, in the computer on hardwired <span style="color:red" data-ts="1892.215" data-end_ts="1892.565" title="1892.215" id=c_"1892.215">__sense__</span>, it's like things are just very predictable. Right. It's like, you know, kind of know what you're <span style="color:red" data-ts="1896.765" data-end_ts="1896.885" title="1896.765" id=c_"1896.765">__gonna__</span> get. And with modulars, I, I just find the accident factor like very high, and so you just put a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1904.685" data-end_ts="1904.845" title="1904.685" id=c_"1904.685">__pack__</span>, you just turn something on and plug something in. Like sometimes I'll have my modular off and like, you know, I've been passed from whatever I left, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1913.075" data-end_ts="1913.365" title="1913.075" id=c_"1913.075">__left__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1913.385" data-end_ts="1913.605" title="1913.385" id=c_"1913.385">__it__</span>, but for some reason I'll turn on. It's like a totally different thing. And it's like the most amazing sound you've ever heard. Right. Right. And so you just, it's just, it's the random factor I think that comes into play, which you don't necessarily get with computers. I mean, do you find, can you get that with something like Max mt Does that lend itself more to that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It can, you know, again, for me and I, I just can only talk about my, about myself. I think every person approaches these things differently. Uhhuh, <affirmative>, but I, I work with Max very similar to the way that I work with my modular. I always start my modular. I practically always start with all, with it completely unplugged. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. And likewise with Max, I normally start with a blank screen and I start adding stuff because that process of adding stuff, the, the track I take tends to develop, you know, it tends to be like my, my feelings at the time tend to come out in the patch. Right, right. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And that's, that's what I find about developing patches. How about you guys? What, what do you like, Jesse, what is your process? What do you do? Do you start from scratch or do you have like a patch that you use and then you spend more of your time tweaking? 
</p>

<p>
<b>The Circuit Jerks: </b>Yeah, I usually start from scratch as well. And I'm still in the process of spending time learning each module. So I'll just do a little experimentation <span style="color:red" data-ts="1999.165" data-end_ts="1999.485" title="1999.165" id=c_"1999.165">__pages__</span> where I work with three modules, let's say. And just really dig into what the capabilities are of each of these modules and explore the sounds of the different wave forms and, and then see what happens from there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That seems like a really great way to do it too, because rather than just learning one module, if you're doing with three, you actually learn like how two modules can affect each other and kind of feed <span style="color:red" data-ts="2025.645" data-end_ts="2025.885" title="2025.645" id=c_"2025.645">__back__</span> on each other. That seems like a pretty fun way to do it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>The Circuit Jerks: </b>So yeah, for me it's the same thing, but there's definitely modules that I've had to spend, you know, just a day, like two or three days alone with like the Shapeshifter was one of those modules. Oh sure. There's so many layers to it. Renee was one of those modules, every module, like the modules as they get more complex, it's like you actually have to sit down and really spend time. There's YouTube videos <span style="color:red" data-ts="2053.915" data-end_ts="2054.205" title="2053.915" id=c_"2053.915">__that__</span> go through just to learn everything about it. Otherwise you're limiting yourself <span style="color:red" data-ts="2058.085" data-end_ts="2058.325" title="2058.085" id=c_"2058.085">__because__</span> you don't really know what it does, but Right. You know, obviously a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2061.885" data-end_ts="2062.085" title="2061.885" id=c_"2061.885">__module__</span> like Renny you have to use with something else. Right. Because it doesn't produce sound, so you wanna understand what it's doing. So, but yeah, I, I definitely find, and then like an instrument, it's interesting that I find like if I'm away from my modular for like a few weeks, 'cause I'm working on other stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>The Circuit Jerks: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, when I come back to it, I feel totally outta practice <laugh>. It's like if you don't play piano for, it's like no, you seriously forget. You're like, like if you sat down with a module and spent time learning it, like the shapeshifter, but then don't use it for a month. Yeah. You forget a lot of what you spent the time. It's like you have to be using these, like the modular thing really takes practice. I'm sure. I'm sure it's the same as like, I mean it's really like any software <span style="color:red" data-ts="2105.745" data-end_ts="2105.965" title="2105.745" id=c_"2105.745">__or__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2106.325" data-end_ts="2106.725" title="2106.325" id=c_"2106.325">__<crosstalk>__</span>, anything you use a lot, like, you just have to, you have to keep at it. But the modular especially, it's like you get out of practice and then it's like kind of rusty 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Yeah. What I, I know for myself, one of the things that happens is if I'm away from it a while when I come back to it, I make really stupid like minimoog patches. Right. Exactly. Exactly. I'm, oh man, I'm not even taking advantage of, of what this thing really can do because it's like I have somehow lost the touch. And you're right. It takes a while to get that back. 
</p>

<p>
<b>The Circuit Jerks: </b>I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2136.285" data-end_ts="2136.445" title="2136.285" id=c_"2136.285">__think__</span> you have to stay on it. Do you have a favorite module or something into right now? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You know, it comes <span style="color:red" data-ts="2142.785" data-end_ts="2143.005" title="2142.785" id=c_"2142.785">__and__</span> it comes and goes. Actually on my, on my blog lately, I've been talking about this weird $90 module called, by Defer called a 180 5 2 Uhhuh <affirmative>. That's a, that's an exciting name, right? Yeah. And all it is is it's a little, it's a little adder, but it allows you to take all different kinds of voltages and add them up, add 'em together, but do it in a way that still maintains the pitch properly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>The Circuit Jerks: </b>Oh wow. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And so what I've been doing is, is doing all kinds of ridiculous stuff with pitch modulation. And it's something that in the past, you know, modular, you tend to either ignore the pitch and just let it do its random shit. Right. Right. Or else you like hook it up with midi CV and then you tune it and you try and keep it in place. Yeah. I'm trying to, I've been playing in the middle and I've been using this little a 180 5 2 and I've been having a ton of fun, but it's sort of like that's my passion for this month and next month it's gonna be the, it's gonna be the maths or it's gonna be the, or it's gonna be something else. I'm a big fan of make noise stuff and I'm a big fan of Intelli stuff and so I have a lot of those modules in my system. 
</p>

<p>
<b>The Circuit Jerks: </b>But that's interesting. Like, that's what I was saying earlier, it's like, it's like, I think people, like, everyone's like, oh, I love the, you know, the bigger, I don't, I don't even know how to say it, but just the more obvious modules, but it's like those weird little like utility modules, like the one you're talking about, like <span style="color:red" data-ts="2235.385" data-end_ts="2235.605" title="2235.385" id=c_"2235.385">__do__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2235.715" data-end_ts="2236.005" title="2235.715" id=c_"2235.715">__make__</span> so many of those. But I think those kind of unnoticed general by people with small systems because that's not what they get. They get the stuff they need. Right. But then there's all these really cool little things like sort of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2248.645" data-end_ts="2248.845" title="2248.645" id=c_"2248.645">__go__</span> unnoticed 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sense. Right. Well, especially the depth <span style="color:red" data-ts="2251.385" data-end_ts="2251.605" title="2251.385" id=c_"2251.385">__for__</span> stuff because it doesn't have cool screen graphics and all that kind of stuff. Yeah. People tend to look at it like it's kind of blah, but man, those, some of those modules can really wake up your system. 
</p>

<p>
<b>The Circuit Jerks: </b>Totally. Exactly. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2264.715" data-end_ts="2265.005" title="2264.715" id=c_"2264.715">__That__</span> really, really wake up your system a lot. Yeah. I mean I, I, I have a lot of go <span style="color:red" data-ts="2270.005" data-end_ts="2270.205" title="2270.005" id=c_"2270.005">__for__</span> stuff like weird little twi delay. Oh yeah. Not audio delay, but like trigger delays and things like that that I use all the time. Oh, the one that I'm talking about is the A 1 62, the ratcheting. Oh yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Right. Oh, that's fun. Well, and, and also all those little <span style="color:red" data-ts="2287.135" data-end_ts="2287.485" title="2287.135" id=c_"2287.135">__defer__</span> switches and stuff, there's so many ways you can have fun with that. Yeah. It's, it's outrageous. Yeah. Well guys, our time is up. I thank you so much for taking the time <span style="color:red" data-ts="2297.025" data-end_ts="2297.245" title="2297.025" id=c_"2297.025">__and__</span>, and you, you got me rolling there because I can talk about modular stuff for from now <span style="color:red" data-ts="2302.485" data-end_ts="2302.725" title="2302.485" id=c_"2302.485">__till__</span> the end of time. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And luckily there's a lot to talk about, but I appreciate you, chatting. When's the next, when's the next, your next release gonna come out because, I really enjoyed this one. 
</p>

<p>
<b>The Circuit Jerks: </b>Not really sure yet. Yeah. We'll see what happens, for the, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And that's the sound of the band's manager hanging up on me. Oh, well we at least got some good information from the guys and it was really fun talking modular and gear and big concepts. And I hope you enjoyed listening into our talk. I want to thank, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2340.405" data-end_ts="2340.725" title="2340.405" id=c_"2340.405">__<inaudible>__</span> guys very much for hanging out and talking. I wanna thank you so much for continuing to listen and for keeping up with the various people that I'm able to run across. It's a lot of fun for me. I hope it's fun for you. Feel free to drop me a line. It's darwinGross@uhgmail.com or ddg@cyclingseventyfour.com. Either those will get to me, looking forward to hearing from you for sure. And thanks for listening again. Catch you later. Bye.
