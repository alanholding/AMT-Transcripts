<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. This week we have a very, very special guest. He's, one of the people that I consider, a super influential artist to me. He's someone whose music I listen to a lot. He's someone that also, I've gotten a lot of requests from you, the listeners, to have on the podcast. It's Robert Rich one of the most talented super musician audio file type guys that I've ever run into. Hi, Robert. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert Rich: </b>I am very flattered feeling right now. Thank you, <laugh>. Oh, well, I'm doing great. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thank you so much for taking time to be, on the podcast. This is a, this is a real special, special opportunity for me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Well, thanks, Darwin I appreciate it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, one of the things in the podcast that I like doing is, starting off by talking about people's background. I'm kind of fascinated with how people come to be, the artists that they become, and particularly in your case where you have a really broad range of things that you do, I'm really curious about how did you get, how did you get there? What were the things that brought you to where you are today? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Well, I think I could summarize it probably just as being very curious. I've, I've always felt that it takes an interested person to be an interesting person. And I think in general, you know, I've spent most of my life as being a rather introverted, nerdy, somewhat intellectual geek. And I essentially, you know, grew up being teased for being like that. And, and now it turns out the geeks are running the world. So I suppose it was an okay strategy. You know, I, I grew up in a suburban family. My father is still alive. He's a aerospace engineer, primarily like a microwave engineer, I guess you'd say. And, he was working at the antenna labs at Stanford and, and at, you know, building linear accelerators in the seventies. And he taught me how to solder and do electronics when I was a kid. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>And so a, a hobby, I would build kits. And, he was also a musician, a still is a jazz guitarist, kind of into the cool jazz, Stan Gatz, Barney Kessel kind of stuff. Which as I was growing up and becoming more interested in music sounded to me like white guy jazz <laugh>. So, of course. So of course I started getting really into Sun Raw and art Ensemble of Chicago and stuff, you know, really much more aggressively experimental music. You know, it's, it's funny cuz it says in the Wikipedia article about me that I grew up hating music or said I hated music or something <laugh>. And, and that's kind of an overstatement. I, I, I grew up around music and I used to sing in church choir and tried to play viola for six weeks in school, and then I chickened out because I realized I wasn't sight reading the music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>I was memorizing the notes and looking at other people's fingering and copying them, which got me pretty far until I suddenly just got shy and ran away. So I think out of a sense of inability and a sense of, not being able to do well or well enough what other people did well, I, I was always the sort of person who would invent my own game so that I could be the best at it. And I was just building electronics and making synthesizers, and I liked noisy experimental music. And so I became the best at playing my own unplayable instruments, you know, and it's, it's kind of, I think, one of, one of many secrets to certain people's success is out of an inability to do what everybody else does, getting really good at something that nobody else has thought of. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. That's, that's a really interesting way to put it. But it's also one that I guess not explicitly, but implicitly kind of comes up in a lot of, in a lot of cases, this, this idea that I couldn't do what everyone else was doing. And so, and so I built my own thing. And whether it was building their own instrument or developing their own artistic style or whatever that was, that was really a case. So what, what kind of things were you making when you were making kits? What, what were the things that drew you in? Were you like a heat kit heath kit person, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Or? That's how I started. I think I was probably in, in fifth grade. And I think my very first kit was a strobe light. Oh, wow. And, yeah. Heath kit. Exactly. And, and wait, in fact, perhaps I'm mistaken. My very first kit my father got me was a volt meter kit. So in fact, it was a kit to build a volt meter <laugh>. And my goodness if that volt meter still doesn't, it still works. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Really? You still have it, huh? Oh, that's awesome. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>It's somewhere I, I don't, I, it's somewhere in, in the basement, but Right. Yeah. That thing worked forever. And so then I got into, laser projectors pretty young, so probably about aged 12 or 13. I, I was pretty good at scrambling for, for money. I had a paper route and I did gardening and I did babysitting, anything I could do around the neighborhood to scrounge up some cash. I even started <span style="color:red" data-ts="337.04" data-end_ts="337.26" title="337.04" id=c_"337.04">__at__</span> a company putting those flyers on people's windshields. I'm sure everybody in the town I grew up just hated, hated me. But I, summer jobs I could manage to make, you know, a couple hundred dollars a month. And so that was how I built my synthesizer. I couldn't afford, you know, the stuff I really was dreaming of, you know, on paper route money, I remember ordering all of the catalogs from Aries and <span style="color:red" data-ts="367.51" data-end_ts="367.86" title="367.51" id=c_"367.51">__Sears__</span> and Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Drooling over them, but a, a single panel of a <span style="color:red" data-ts="373.1" data-end_ts="373.34" title="373.1" id=c_"373.1">__sage__</span> module cost something like $1,500, which was, that's more money than I could make in three years. So there's no way. But, I did manage to get myself a laser the summer before high school, and it was a, a cost me about 200 bucks, and it was <span style="color:red" data-ts="392.46" data-end_ts="392.58" title="392.46" id=c_"392.46">__a__</span> 0.5 milliwatt helium, neon <span style="color:red" data-ts="394.54" data-end_ts="394.74" title="394.54" id=c_"394.54">__tube__</span> blazer around 1976, I think. And, I built a bunch of projectors for that. And so when I was a freshman in high school, I could do light shows for the rock band that I got friends with. Oh man. And sort of started hanging around with musicians. I was, I was the nerdy straight kid, kind of chubby <laugh> and, hanging out with all these cool stoners who were playing Led Zeppelin and Genesis at dances in the mid seventies, you know, <laugh>. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The idea, you know, it's funny you say that because the idea of there being a dance related to Genesis just seems so odd now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b><laugh>. Oh yeah. These guys were pretty good musicians. I've stayed somewhat in touch with one or two of them. And yeah, I mean, they could, they could do, what I think <span style="color:red" data-ts="442.34" data-end_ts="442.46" title="442.34" id=c_"442.34">__they__</span>, they did a couple covers off a trick of the tail or something, and Oh, <span style="color:red" data-ts="445.14" data-end_ts="445.38" title="445.14" id=c_"445.14">__yeah__</span>. It weren't shabby. Mostly I remember, you know, it was, it was, it was the seventies. I was able to, hang out with these guys and did their light show they put up with me, put it that way. And nobody knew in high school that I was building synthesizers and wanting to, to start a band, because I wasn't a real musician. The, the synthesizer kits I started building were from the famous company in Oklahoma, Paia that, that pretty much anybody in the seventies who, you know, like Craig Anderton and all these people started with this stuff, it was horrendously bad sounding, audio equipment. I mean, it, John Simonton, bless his heart, was a cheapskate. He really would design the cheapest circuit possible with, with the 2,000,033 K resistors. He bought surplus somewhere, right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="500.14" data-end_ts="500.42" title="500.14" id=c_"500.14">__There__</span> were, there were strange circuits because he would, he would go to like <span style="color:red" data-ts="504.38" data-end_ts="504.5" title="504.38" id=c_"504.38">__a__</span> lot sales and end up with, with thousands of some really strange value of capacitor, and then try to make his circuits so that they could use up all of his weird capacitors. And so they'd have all these bizarre, values of resistors, just 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That certainly explains a lot, just, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="524.01" data-end_ts="524.5" title="524.01" id=c_"524.01">__Because__</span> he was so cheap, but that, that's how he could make a kit for $33. Yeah. You know, you could, you could build a whole synthesizer, like a, a one voice synthesizer with a VCA and, and envelopes and two oscillators for, for like $200. It was ridiculously cheap. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So did you, were you, you know, when I cast back to those days, I remember things like, he had a little mono synth called the Proteus, and there was the strings in things. I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Had one of those, the Proteus was too expensive for me. Uhhuh. I heard it was a real mess too. Oh, really? My very first synthesizer was of course, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="560.65" data-end_ts="560.94" title="560.65" id=c_"560.65">__Nome__</span>. Right. I remember this stuff so vividly. It's really strange. Somehow I thought I was gonna be able to make like Klaus Schultz sounds with <span style="color:red" data-ts="568.42" data-end_ts="568.66" title="568.42" id=c_"568.42">__that__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> <span style="color:red" data-ts="570.52" data-end_ts="570.74" title="570.52" id=c_"570.52">__Dan__</span> made bird farts. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>I remember building this thing and it sounded like, like a mosquito buzzing in the room. It was this Yeah. Right. <laugh>, it was like a, it was like a one pole filter and a, and a piece of vinyl, resistive element. Very strange little synthesizer. So, but, but he, he got you, you know, it's like the stuff was so incomplete and so bad sounding that he made you lust after more and more somehow, especially if you're a 13 year old kid, you imagine that, that if you build more modules, it will sound more and more better <laugh>, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="606.06" data-end_ts="606.34" title="606.06" id=c_"606.06">__more__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Better. Right. Well, and but isn't that exactly where we end up today, where with the reversion to modular systems, we're all like one, one module away from per perfection. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Oh. But everything sounds, everything sounds so good now. That's true. And the quality is ridiculously better than it used to be. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You know, it's, it's funny, I, oh man, I haven't thought of a <span style="color:red" data-ts="628.58" data-end_ts="628.78" title="628.58" id=c_"628.58">__pie__</span> in a long time, but, I remember in college, for a band I was in, one of my friends that was in the band actually built us strings and things. And, it was, of all the junk that we had on stage, it was the closest thing to sounding like anything anyone would want to hear. It was actually had a kind of interesting voicing. It wasn't an ARP Omni by any stretch. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>No. It was a top octave chip with a bunch of, phase shifters, wasn't it? <span style="color:red" data-ts="658.76" data-end_ts="658.98" title="658.76" id=c_"658.76">__And__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. But it sounded at least interesting. And, and it 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Sounded like a vacuum cleaner, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, we got on, we had this big gig, and so we get up on stage and this poor, this poor guy, all he had for keyboards was, a clavinet and his strings and things. Right. And so we get up on stage, everything's getting set up, and like two minutes before we go on stage, someone trips over a cable and that strings and things goes flying and turns into a collection of about 500 bits of stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Oh yeah. There were, so many resistors in <span style="color:red" data-ts="694.5" data-end_ts="694.54" title="694.5" id=c_"694.5">__there__</span>. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It was crazy. <span style="color:red" data-ts="695.24" data-end_ts="695.66" title="695.24" id=c_"695.24">__Worked__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="695.66" data-end_ts="695.9" title="695.66" id=c_"695.66">__Some__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>S Yeah. And then, and so he ends up having to play the whole gig, doing the string parts on a clavinet. It was just brutal <laugh>. But anyway. Yeah. So, did, so you kind of, pieced together your first synthesizer out of, out of kits. Now, to what extent did you take those kits and modify them or and learn about the guts? Or did you kind of follow the rules and make what he said? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>A little bit of both. I started getting more into custom when Craig Anderton designed some, Curtis chip boards for paa. And, you could get blank boards in the chip and then go find the parts and Right. Those were huge advancement. Those, Curtis chip circuits actually sounded excellent. And so I built some custom modules with those and, would hide them behind the patch panels of the synth. So I'd convert some blank patch panels into sort of secret filters. And, you know, nobody knew how to play the synth other than me, because nothing was labeled right. I just happened to know that, that the third jack on the left of this patch panel was actually the input to a all <span style="color:red" data-ts="763.26" data-end_ts="763.5" title="763.26" id=c_"763.26">__past__</span> resident filter or something like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>And then, <span style="color:red" data-ts="768.98" data-end_ts="769.1" title="768.98" id=c_"768.98">__a__</span> funny thing is like, if we were to skip ahead to the late nineties, I became friends with Paul Schreiber who started Synthesis Technology, right. M LTM Modular. And, and it turned out to be a really funny full history loop because he used to work for Tandy back in the seventies, and, had designed several kits for them. And he also designed the, the Tandy Radio Shack Moog, that he essentially took Robert Moog's design and then tried to do cost engineering so that RadioShack could get away with selling it for $500 or 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Whatever. So he was involved with the MG one? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Yeah. Yeah. He, he actually designed that using, using Bob's circuitry, but he, he just did all the cost engineering to make it so that they could afford to build it. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's hilarious. I actually interviewed him for a podcast a couple of months ago. He never let, let loose that one. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Oh, yeah. Yeah. And then he also designed something that, that was, kind of a game changer for me. And it was a, it was called the Electronic Reverb Kit that RadioShack sold. And, it was a redon, s a d 10 24, bucket Brigade delay. And in his, and he designed the kit, he designed a lot of their kits, it turns out mm-hmm. <affirmative> and, you know, he was right outta college himself. And I, you know, I was still a kid in high school. And so the, this, analog delay kit, which cost $40, I remember it vividly, <laugh> mm-hmm. <affirmative>, and, and it came with the Redon ship, and then you had to find the other parts. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, I see. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>And, <span style="color:red" data-ts="863.34" data-end_ts="863.54" title="863.34" id=c_"863.34">__and__</span> that Raton ship was usually about $20 on its own. So they essentially found a huge pile of them somewhere, and f found a way to get rid of them. He mentioned that there were two modifications you could do in the, in the manual. It said this as a little addendum, and it was his idea that you could put a switch in with a different capacitor to extend the range from a very short, like flanger kind of thing to a, a full echo. And there was also a modification you could make so that it would go into full feedback, and suddenly it became a insane oscillator and a, an experimental music device, you know, Uhhuh <affirmative>. So I recorded a bunch of pieces using essentially that and, and the pa and, and it was kind of a breakthrough. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, let's, let's talk about how you did recordings though, because if you were scraping resistors, you know, resistors out of piles in order to make this little synthesizer, what did you use for a recording device? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Cassette <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Like a 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Table? Just a, a high cassette table top. Oh, yeah. It was a Hitachi, cassette recorder that could handle metal, and it had a Dolby A and or a what? Adobe B and C switch, I think. Oh, okay. Might've even had dbx. I remember I had a lot of cassettes. I had a later tac cassette deck that had DBX on it, so 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I did too. And, and now try and find a way to get a decent sounding sound out of that. It's really kind of tough. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Yeah. You know, what you do is you play the cassettes without any noise reduction engaged, and then, you use single-ended noise, reduction algorithms, and it sounds okay. And the DBX just adds a really, a really subtle compression to everything 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>But, that's the, you probably know that there was a four record set that just came out of Germany of my really old recordings, from 1980 to 85. And, so I've been doing a bunch of interviews lately about the early days. It's kind of a weird retro flashback month for me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, that's interesting. What's, I didn't know about this. What's the name of the, is this on your site? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Yeah, it's, it's from, vinyl on Demand, v o d in Germany. And you Americans can get them direct from, my website, Robert Richcom. It's called, premonitions Premonitions 1980. Yeah. Okay. <span style="color:red" data-ts="995.36" data-end_ts="995.58" title="995.36" id=c_"995.36">__Yep__</span>. 1980 to 1985. And, the first, and this is vinyl right now, it's a vinyl only release. And once it sells out, I'll make it a download, but it won't be coming out on cd. These are cassettes that I've had in storage for 35 years, almost 33 years. And, they still play, luckily, at least most of 'em, one or two of them didn't. And so I did a whole bunch of, restoration on these and tried to get them to sound, you know, good enough. I, I didn't think they sounded good enough back when I recorded them. They weren't things that I wanted to release back then, but nowadays with the tools we have, I was able to get them to sound Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>I think. And, it's a really nice package. I have four records set, and the first one is I was 17 years old when I did this stuff. Wow. Another breakthrough for me, instrument wise was I, I made friends with a couple guys from, sequential Circuits, which was one of the first synthesizer. It was the first synthesizer to have, data to have memory storage. Right. Profit five was a polyphonic synthesizer that could recall, I think it was, about 40 memories of patches. And there's no way I could have afforded one of these when I was 16 years old. But I, I'd met a, a radio dj, a guy named Rick Huber at the local college station, and he had a progressive rock show on Sunday afternoons. I'm still very good friends with Rick, by the way. He's become, a, a tour manager for a lot of bands. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>He's been working for the Beach Boys for the last 10 years or so. He used to work for Meatloaf and people like that. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> organizing their, their tours. He's a really very useful person. He's also worked for Bill Bruford and for David Torn and people like that. Right. And so Rick, at the time, I, I had befriended him. He was 22 years old and I was 15 and I asked him if he knew anybody who would wanna start a band, cuz I wanted to make weird improvised electronic music. You know, I, that's what I wanted to do. I didn't wanna be a pop star. I wanted to make weird music <laugh> mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And, he said, I think I know somebody. I work at a synthesizer company and a guy just started working there who just moved here from Europe and, he's into strange stuff and I think he might like this. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>And so he introduced me to Rick Davies, who turned into my lifelong best friend. And Rick and I, you know, did the group amoeba back in the nineties, and he's just a, a buddy. And, Rick was also, I mean, he became editor for Music Technology back in the eighties. Right. Moved down to Los Angeles and actually started, home and studio recording for them. So he is been in the industry for a long time and, turns out that the very first profit five revision rev one that came out of Sequential Circuits, I think in 1978, if I'm not mistaken, was a real lemon. It would break if you looked at it wrong. <laugh>. And they had a whole batch of, capacitors that, that, they were used for the power supply as, as line filters. And the problem is this capacitor had a horrible tendency to, to fry in a shorted position, which meant it would short together the ground and the power bus causing the whole thing to actually smoke and burst into flames. <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Nice. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Which is not a good thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's the Ford Pinto of synthesizers. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Exactly. And so there were several other <span style="color:red" data-ts="1210.5" data-end_ts="1210.54" title="1210.5" id=c_"1210.5">__Es__</span> essentially the Rev one Profit five was a prototype that they were selling for $6,000 and they sold about a hundred of them or more. And then as soon as they could get the Rev two out, they essentially offered a $2,000 upgrade, or maybe it was a $1,500 upgrade to all of their clients to get a Rev two that actually worked. Right. And people took it, thank goodness, because otherwise they would have a bunch of broken synths. Right. And these were rock stars, you know, these were very popular synthesizers. So anyway, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1244.84" data-end_ts="1245.06" title="1244.84" id=c_"1244.84">__pro__</span>, sequential had a whole bunch of lemons on their hand. Now they had to get rid of somehow of all the traded in Rev ones. And so they essentially said to their employees, tell you what, you can buy one for $500. Just, I never want to see it again. <laugh> never bring it in for repair. It is unfixable. Right. They were almost UNT tuneable, you couldn't calibrate them. And so only about two or three people in the world knew how to replace them, or, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1270.42" data-end_ts="1270.62" title="1270.42" id=c_"1270.42">__or__</span> I'm sorry, knew how to repair them. Right. And one of them was Rick Davies <laugh>, of course, who was in the tech department. Another one is Andrew McGowan, who is now working for Dave Smith, again, <laugh>. And another one was Rick Huber <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh my

<b>Robert: </b>Goodness. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1285.12" data-end_ts="1285.34" title="1285.12" id=c_"1285.12">__To__</span> be the DJ I'm talking about. They were all in the tech department and they were pretty much the only people in the world who knew how to fix a rev one. And so I was able to get one through Rick for $500, which was ridiculous. And that's when I started being able to record properly and, and actually be able to perform 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1305.26" data-end_ts="1305.46" title="1305.26" id=c_"1305.26">__around__</span>. Yeah. That's an amazing story. Just because if nothing else, the ability to kind of leapfrog from <span style="color:red" data-ts="1312.64" data-end_ts="1312.86" title="1312.64" id=c_"1312.64">__pie__</span> kits to a profit that must have, that must <span style="color:red" data-ts="1316.58" data-end_ts="1316.7" title="1316.58" id=c_"1316.58">__have__</span> been one of those things where you went down, went into the basement and didn't come out for six months just from exploring. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>It was enormous for me. Yeah. It was huge. Suddenly, suddenly I could do these, you know, sweeping synth performances that sounded like what I was imagining in my head. You know, the, you couldn't get the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1336.56" data-end_ts="1336.78" title="1336.56" id=c_"1336.56">__pie__</span> to sound like, you know, pop vu or Tangerine Dream, but you, you sure could get a profit five to do that. Not, you know, without a proper multi-track studio and a Right. And a bunch more gear than 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That still had to work, but 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>You could get something that, that felt like music, at least. Right. And not just squelchy noises, but what that meant is that I got pretty good at making squelchy noises, which became a very useful talent later on. Right. You know, having the paia that could only make bird calls and weird insect noises and distorted grumbling rumblings allowed me to, to find a vocabulary of synthesis that I probably wouldn't have tried otherwise. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I was gonna ask you, to what extent does working with sort of the, the oddities of that musical world end up opening your ears to it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>No. What you have to remember is that, is that we always need limitations. And I, I don't think that much good art of any of any category of art gets made when people have no limitations. You have to set yourself boundaries if the world isn't doing it for you. A lot of people, especially nowadays, that there's so many tools out there and the software workstations let just, you know, they come built in with 300 different plugins that allow you to do everything. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>People think that they need more gear in order to make better music. And what they should be doing instead is hiding everything but two instruments and getting really good at those and, and working with just those limitations. You know, when, when you hear the, the most interesting, let's say guitarists, that they're often not the most versatile or the, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1453.73" data-end_ts="1454.02" title="1453.73" id=c_"1453.73">__they__</span>, they only know how to sound like themselves. Right. But they have a sound that nobody else has come up with. They sound original. Yeah. And I, I think limitations are essential. And, and equipment limitations are something that people don't even experience anymore. And it's almost, I think for, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I don't think they even want to hear about it, frankly, because I think for a lot of people, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1477.2" data-end_ts="1477.42" title="1477.2" id=c_"1477.2">__the__</span>, they actually get a bigger serotonin rush from buying a thing than from playing a thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Yeah. And perhaps that's an artifact of wealth. I mean, we, we really do have a lot more, how to put it. Technology has become so affordable that we can, we have immense buying power for a powerful, device. I mean, there is more mips in, in a, in a smartphone than there was in a computer until 1995. Right. You know, it's, you could probably, you know, do things in an iPad that, that the com that the, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1520.32" data-end_ts="1520.54" title="1520.32" id=c_"1520.32">__Ley__</span> Samson box at C <span style="color:red" data-ts="1522.02" data-end_ts="1522.14" title="1522.02" id=c_"1522.02">__C__</span> R M A couldn't do in 1985. Right. We had two hundred and fifty six sixteen bit oscillators in the Samson Box at Stanford, and we could do, FM really well, cuz it was really efficient mm-hmm. <affirmative>, and it could do sampling. It turned out that that PCM sampling was very efficient. But try to do additive synthesis, you could use the whole thing just to create one, one note. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>It's difficult for people to realize though, that having more tools, having more powerful tools doesn't give them better ideas. Right. And limitations. And forcing yourself to work within boundaries actually forces you to think outside of the boundaries. And suddenly you're breaking rules and you're coming up with new ideas and you're finding yourself to be stimulated. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, in addition to that though, there's a certain extent to which you have to have some kind of background that is maybe a nesting place for these ideas as well. And I'm really curious because when I look at the information about this, premonitions album, it, it's from the years 1980 through 85. How old were you at the earliest of this? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>I was 17. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. The way it listed here, I obviously haven't heard it yet, is that it's early ambient and experimental electronics. Now, most 17 year olds would be hard pressed to, know what ambient music might be or what experimental music might be. They have, because most 17 year olds are, are far more tuned into pop culture than they are to experimental culture. Clearly in your case, that wasn't, that wasn't true. How did you, where was your head at that <laugh> that was the kind of music that you were making? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Well see, obviously I didn't have my head where most teenagers shoot <span style="color:red" data-ts="1640.89" data-end_ts="1641.38" title="1640.89" id=c_"1640.89">__because__</span> I was really bad at, at making music to get laid, you know, <laugh>. You know, it was, it was the kind of music that would scare all the potential dates away as far as possible. But, <laugh>, you know, I mean that's really, if, if you come down to it, that's what pop music is all about. Right. Right. It's, it's about the sexual, sexual <span style="color:red" data-ts="1661.36" data-end_ts="1661.78" title="1661.36" id=c_"1661.36">__nature__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Of man. That's right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Yeah. So, so I was just an oddity. I I really lived a, a very internal life. I had a, a a a, a very active imagination, and I was kind of an introvert and would spend a lot of time alone. I was one of those people who actually enjoyed studying and reading and stuff like that. And I'd go in long walks. And music interested me as a kind of philosophical way to ask questions because the soundscape fascinated me. I was more interested in becoming a s an a conceptual artist, or I imagined it at the time as being a kind of 21st century shaman. I really wanted to find a way to, to communicate the beauty of the internal landscape, the, the consciousness capabilities of the human imagination. What we could do by journeying inside. I've, I've come to, to like the term spelunking for this kind of activity. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Mm-hmm. <affirmative> of basically being quiet, you know, alone with your eyes closed, alert and journeying within the possible realms of thought. Exploring as if you're in a cave through your own memories and through your own senses. I remember when I was about 13, my, my grandparents had died and my parents moved back to my grandparents' house, which was a beautiful old craftsman house built in the 1920s with a creek running through the property. And I remember the first rainy, warm spring nights in, in March, listening to the frogs out in the creek, and the rain dripping from the leaves. I had a, I had a bedroom with, with windows that opened in the corner of the room, and I had the bed right in those windows so that I could open the, open both sides of the windows. And it felt like I was in a tree house with my head outside in the, in the leaf canopy, almost hearing the rain dripping. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>And I discovered that with my eyes closed and my ears wide open, I could journey like out of body with sound. And that sound allows you to move your consciousness into far away places through the landscape. I would journey into the landscape physically, psychologically, with sound. And, and I remember the frogs teaching me polyrhythms the way they would, you know, when they would be sparse. You'd hear this, the, the rhythms of the frogs were more musical to me than a lot of the stuff I could hear on the radio. I mean, that was really where my musical mind was very quickly moving as this world of pure sound. I was more interested in that than I was in notes. And I don't think I had a, an innate fondness for <span style="color:red" data-ts="1861.99" data-end_ts="1862.34" title="1861.99" id=c_"1861.99">__triad__</span> harmony. I, I didn't really like, I think, I think when I got quoted as saying I didn't like music as a child, what I didn't re, you know, I, I, I actually told that to my grandfather once when my sister and my grandfather were trying to get me to listen to their big band, big band jazz, which, which now I love. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>And what I realized it probably meant to them when I said I don't like music was that I didn't like triadic harmony. I don't really, I find it claustrophobic. I find Mozart to be a little claustrophobic. It's too perfect. It's like, it, it came down already finished from the skies in some lattice work, you know. And luckily we had a radio station on the, in the East Bay in Berkeley, called kpfa. And they had a music director at the time named Charles Marcian, who's also a very famous sound poet. And his, he started a series of concerts here in the Bay Area, now called Other Minds. And Charles May not realize just how influential he was to many, many composers. He championed a lot of the new tonal composers and sound artists that were happening in the seventies. So minimalism was big at the time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>And people like Terry Riley were in the Bay Area. And, and then you could hear through Charles Ian's music shows, you know, I heard about people like Anaya Lockwood and, Pauline Oliveros, many of these female composers actually. Marianne <span style="color:red" data-ts="1953.56" data-end_ts="1953.78" title="1953.56" id=c_"1953.56">__Ahe__</span> was another big influence for me. And what was interesting about these women composers is that their music wasn't arrogant like a lot of the male composers. It was about something other than itself. It was pointing away from the composer and into the listener. Paulina Ros coined the term deep listening, which I found to be far more powerful than the word ambient. Right. Of course, I knew about Eno at the time. Everybody did. Everyone did, you know, you know, was prog rock god. And, you know, when he went ambient, everybody thought he had, you know, lost everything Interesting about it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>It was, I liked his ambient work a lot, but I was more influenced by this idea of deep listening. I didn't like the idea of background music. I liked the idea of, of psychoactive music. I wanted the music to get in under the skin and work its way into your core in a very slow way that required active attention. And that's what Pauline was doing with her meditations. She did these sonic meditations. The compose, the, the composition would be a sentence on a piece of paper, and it would say something like, like, breathe in deeply, exhale and make a sound. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> repeat <laugh>. And that was the composition. Right. And, and her work was a little new agey, but in a very experimental, very scary, kind of almost threatening way that I loved. And, you know, Terry was doing these amazing organ improvisations with tape loops. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>And, it was an exciting time, I think, where you could really start believing that, that there was a revolution happening in a way of listening. And minimalism in art was doing the same thing. It was pointing to the viewer, it was pointing to the room where the art was in, or the hillside where it was installed. And to get people to pay attention to their environment. People like James Terrell, you know, or, you know, even, Chris <span style="color:red" data-ts="2076.5" data-end_ts="2076.78" title="2076.5" id=c_"2076.5">__Burden__</span>, who was doing the performance art, you know, that was very scary stuff with batteries in saltwater, allowing people to tip a bucket over to electrocute the artist and things like this. I found it very powerful because it got you to, to ask moral questions and engage yourself actively with the art. So that's why I like deep listening as a concept. It was an almost an instruction to the listener, not so much a description of the sound itself. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, I think, well, first of all, I'll say this, I wish my 17 year old self could have met your 17 year old self, because, I remember going through a lot of those same kind of feelings and feeling completely alienated from the rest of humanity, <laugh>. And, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2125.98" data-end_ts="2126.14" title="2125.98" id=c_"2125.98">__Well__</span>, most 17 year olds are somewhat alienated, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I, I guess, from the 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Rest of humanity, aren't 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>They? But I, I also think that you actually found yourself by being on, by being in the Bay Area. You actually put yourself in the, in the position to be least trampled upon by humanity. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b><laugh>, I didn't become angry and start killing people <laugh>. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Or, or just take a job as a janitor and learn to use heroin. You know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>You know, I think making art is one of the best medicines that people can possibly have, and that creativity is an essential and a forgotten need among adolescents. And I think that the, the public school systems for running out of budget and for trying to, to prioritize, you know, reading Right and arithmetic kind of studies, they could be just creating psychotic people with no outlet for their own human urges, for creativity and, and for beauty. We need to have these outlets. I must say another huge influence for me was listening to Thro and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2194.74" data-end_ts="2195.06" title="2194.74" id=c_"2194.74">__Gristle__</span> being interviewed on kf j c in Foothill College, the same station where my friend Rick Huber was at. It was kind of my home station. I just played there live actually, just two weeks ago. Oh, wow. And it was also where I first performed live when I was 17, in 1980 with these two, with Rick Davies. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>I remember in 1977, I think it was hearing, maybe it was 76, even hearing Genesis Peor from Throbbing <span style="color:red" data-ts="2220.94" data-end_ts="2221.26" title="2220.94" id=c_"2220.94">__Gristle__</span> and his first visit to the Bay Area doing an interview with Clay Holden on this radio station. Clay was the person who turned this radio station into what was pretty much the first punk radio station in, in the United States, at least on the West Coast. And, th Robin Grisel came here with the intention of, well, they had a friend Monte Kaza here in the Bay Area. And, you know, they wanted, they, they felt that San Francisco had the kind of strange underground art potential that would understand what they were doing. Right. And what I got from them was this idea that you didn't need permission. You can do whatever you want artistically and define it in your own ways and just put it out there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>They were completely independent. They started their own record label. They defined their own terms. They played by their own rules. They invented the rules. And, you know, they coined Monte Kaza actually coined the term industrial music mm-hmm. <affirmative>. So although what I ended up doing in my own career was much more quiet and much more introspective and well introverted perhaps. What I owe to the industrial scene is this idea of do it yourself. Don't ask permission. Nobody's gonna ask you to exist. Right. You just have to go out there and be the most pure expression of yourself and change the world. That is an, a very empowering message for teenagers. You know, for adolescents. It can make you into an idealist that will annoy the heck out of every adult around you. And I probably did. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But, but that's what you need to do when you're 17. Also, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>You have to change the world. There's so much that needs fixing. Right. If nobody's gonna try, then why bother? You know? So I really decided that, that I needed to do what I could do best to, to have a good effect on the planet. Cuz I certainly felt strongly that, that things were broken. Anytime I would look at the environment, I would almost break into tears. I'm, I'm a very fragile person. Sometimes I feel like I don't have skin, you know, just raw nerves on the outside of me. Right. And as I would think inside of myself of how to use my existence, how to use my life for improving the world, rather than just, you know, sucking off of it, I realized, okay, I'm not, I don't have the personality to be a politician. I don't really care enough about money to be good at business. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>I, I'm not a very good religious fervor kind of person. What I do well is create experiences. I realized pretty young that I was deep inside of a personality of, of a shaman. I was a journeyer. My skill was to be able to create worlds inside of my mind and what I was doing before I realized that I had to, to, to create art. I was painting my own version of, you know, the Sistine Chapel on the inside of an eggshell in a hermetically sealed place. And the process of creating art, the is the process of breaking open your perfectly hermetically sealed world of beauty and allowing it to be poisoned by everything that's out there. It is a toxic experience and it's a, quite literally you have to break it. You have to <span style="color:red" data-ts="2448.97" data-end_ts="2449.39" title="2448.97" id=c_"2448.97">__sunder__</span> it and compromise all of its purity in order for anybody to be able to experience something like what you're experiencing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. You're just blowing my head off because, one of the things that I talk to a lot of people about, because I'm curious, I talk to a lot of people about how you, work yourself up to allowing your artistic work to be <span style="color:red" data-ts="2479.23" data-end_ts="2479.39" title="2479.23" id=c_"2479.23">__released__</span> to the world. And I, I like to ask people questions about this because I personally have a real difficult time with it. And I think you have kind of identified one of the points that makes it so difficult for me. And I think for a lot of people, which is the sense that as long as a thing is in your head, it has a beauty and it has a personage that's, that you can hold and nurture and love and releasing it as, as an artistic work means having to, you know, stop nurturing, let it go, and then watch it, watch it potentially, and often break on the rocks. And 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>There's two things that I could add to that. And I think <span style="color:red" data-ts="2529.89" data-end_ts="2530.18" title="2529.89" id=c_"2529.89">__that__</span> what you've said is, is very true. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2532.14" data-end_ts="2532.34" title="2532.14" id=c_"2532.14">__And__</span> there's a certain personality of perfectionist, often super talented person. I've known, I've known people who were so much better than I am in, in music. And they never could finish any idea. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2545.21" data-end_ts="2545.5" title="2545.21" id=c_"2545.21">__They__</span> never got anything out. And, and there's two things I can speak to about that. One is the difficult shift in consciousness from the creation process to the, to putting yourself in an imaginary person's shoes and listening to your work as if it's not yours. Becoming the audience. And it involves a strange shift of consciousness. If you can't give yourself that neutral view of your own idea, then you'll have trouble ever making something that works for the public, the way you imagine it should work. So there's a critical process where people will eat themselves alive by hating their work. And that's different. Instead of tearing yourself down when you step outside of your work and going, this sucks, it's not perfect. It's not what's in my head. What you have to say is, I am now the listener. What do I need this to do now? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Right. And that's a very different process cuz it's a creative process. It's not a destructive process. The other thing I was gonna say about this is that art of any creative action, whether it in even well having children, is a lot like this. Quite literally, there's a medieval story from, Jewish Eastern Europe, about the golum. And of course it's been re retold in so many ways, including the, the same character being used in, in Lord of the Rings. But the original myth of the Golum is that a great rabbi actually comes to understand the name of God, and he realizes that this is the word of God that can breathe life into forms. And so, in an act of hubris, he makes a little boy out of clay, and he breathes the word of God into this little boy. And it gets up and it runs off and wreaks havoc throughout the town and becomes a nightmare. It's because it is soulless, it has life, but no mind. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. So, you know, in an act of contrition, the the Rabbi has to get down on his knees and pray to God and say, oh, I'm sorry I did this thing in an act of arrogance. You know, please, you know, solve this problem. And, I, I believe if I'm not mistaken, that the ending of it, its God pretty much has to say, no, sorry, you have to deal with it. <laugh>. Well, you know, you created this 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>No happy ending 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b><laugh>. Yeah. This is, and it's a metaphor, you know, for, for the creative act. Cause actually every work of art is a gollum. We, we let it out there and it can do it, it can wreak havoc. You know, you can't exactly control your work once it leaves your hands once it's out in public. And, and so you have to inject the most pure intention possible into this act of creation. For lack of a better word, I would say for karmic reasons. I've, I'm known for making some pretty heavy music. Sometimes. I did the album Stalker with Lust <span style="color:red" data-ts="2737.22" data-end_ts="2737.5" title="2737.22" id=c_"2737.22">__Mord__</span> and Troubled Resting Place and Below Zero are pretty heavy. And there's a certain side of my audience, which is very into dark music, into, industrial and grind core and things like that. Which is funny because I'm not like that <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Not, you're not that guy. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>I'm this nerdy, you know, scientist type I guess. But, the, the interesting thing is, you know, I I'm very aware of the energy that music can create, and I'm very cautious about the intention in my heavy music. None of it is about darkness. It's about awe to me. It's about wonder and things that are much bigger than me. And I think that conveys, I think that that's in, in there 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sense. I absolutely agree. I, it's interesting you mentioned Trouble Resting Place because that was the first album of years that I got. You happened to be coming through Milwaukee at one point. You were touring with Satori, I think mm-hmm. <affirmative>, and, I, you were at a little shop and I stopped in and said hi. And you were very nice. And you pointed me towards that as being your newest album. And I got it. And I loved it. I got, I had buttoned that and propagation 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And I just really love them because, and I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2823.7" data-end_ts="2823.86" title="2823.7" id=c_"2823.7">__love__</span> them for a couple of reasons. One of 'em because, because the soundscape was just wonderful and the, the recording was wonderful. And, and so, you know, kind of on that, it was, it was technically good enough that I didn't have to think about the technology <laugh>, which that is definitely hidden. Yeah. Well, you know, but that's, that's something that you don't often get to say, because sometimes people who, you know, you self-describe as a nerdy guy. But I would say that there's something a lot deeper than that because most of the nerdy guys are getting, get into this idea of showing you every bit of technology so that you're in awe of the technology. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Oh, yeah. I like seamlessness with Yeah. I, I succeed if you have no idea what instruments you're, you're listening to. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. And, and that was certainly the case. But the other thing that really struck me, because I had, I had always been interested in, in electronic music, but one of the things that happened as things moved from kind of the, oh, I would say the mid seventies sort of electronic experimentalism into what became New Age, there was this sense that if you were going to have instrumental electronic music, that it was going to have this overt spiritualism often where the person that was, that whom you were listening to found themselves, or you would find them describing themselves as a guru of some sort. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Ugh. I always make me wanna puke 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Yeah, me too. And I, I felt like in your thing, I felt the spirituality of what you were doing. I felt the depth of your exploration without ever feeling like you were saying, oh, follow me now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Yeah. I think the questions are so much more powerful than the answers <laugh>. You know, there's another metaphor that I use a lot, in, in the way I think about how we communicate, our ideas to people. There's this misunderstanding that, that art is a messenger of sort of beauty and truth and, and the aesthetic experience, you know, and, and people mistake the ex the aesthetic experience as something like food that you ingest and it somehow, you know, gives you energy or fuel. And so therefore, the artist in this metaphor would be like little Red <span style="color:red" data-ts="2976.34" data-end_ts="2976.54" title="2976.34" id=c_"2976.34">__Riding__</span> Hood, carrying a basket full of cookies and, and they sort of come to you and say, here's your cookies, and then you eat them. And that is the art. And I'd rather think of it in a really different way. And this is more coming from postmodernist, minimalism and experiential art. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>And that is <span style="color:red" data-ts="2995.42" data-end_ts="2995.62" title="2995.42" id=c_"2995.42">__that__</span>, you know, I I say let's look at the aesthetic experience, not as a thing that we ingest, but let's look at it as if it were a muscle. What if we use that metaphor? What if I tell the fat guy playing the, the gaming, the device and sitting there eating cookies all day long? And I say, why didn't you go down to the store and get me a newspaper and come back with that? And you say that every day for a year, and it's not because you need a newspaper, it's because he needs to get out and get to the store and go walking, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Get some exercises. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>And at the end of the year you find out that, that this guy is actually feeling much better, he's less fat, he's less depressed. And, and this person asks you, why did you go out? Why did you ask me to go get a newspaper every day? You don't even read them. It's like, well, look at you. You're happier <laugh>. That's, I think, what art is more like, it's, it's getting people to, to exercise an innate part of the human experience of the human mind, which is, which is a beauty muscle. A truth muscle. It's, it's something that if we don't ask questions that are related to the meaning of life, those muscles go dormant. And we stop asking and we stop experiencing life. So, so simply by getting people to engage the process of truthing and brutalizing and questioning, meaning we create spirituality within each of us simply by the doing of that. It's, it's an action and it's not an answer. Right. So I'm always more interested in the questions. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, this is really inspirational. I appreciate you being willing to share with this stuff because you have produced a lot of material and I've listened to much of it, in one form or another. And 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Did you just say there's too much of it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>No. <laugh>, I said I've listened too much of it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>I'm joking. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, no, there's not too much of it. It's fantastic. There is one <span style="color:red" data-ts="3130.46" data-end_ts="3130.58" title="3130.46" id=c_"3130.46">__of__</span> the things, one of the things that I've really kind of gotten into lately, and frankly it's because it's on Spotify, so you're gonna be, I'm gonna be responsible for you to get, for you getting that 450th of a <span style="color:red" data-ts="3144.66" data-end_ts="3144.9" title="3144.66" id=c_"3144.66">__sense__</span> that they're gonna pay <span style="color:red" data-ts="3146.8" data-end_ts="3147.02" title="3146.8" id=c_"3146.8">__out__</span> <laugh>. Yes. But, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>I, I actually think I got several dollars from Spotify last week. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Wow, good for you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>There's be a lot of people listening, <laugh> must 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Be, or me just listening obsessively to the same thing over and over again. Yeah. But they have, a number of your live archives on there mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And I think it's, I I really love that work because first of all, I, again, it, it tends to speak to me because most of my work is not recorded. It's live performance. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And, and some of it for me is because, you know, as we were just talking, I'm, I'm not super comfortable with the release process, but if I'm, if I'm doing a live performance, I'm sharing something with people and that sharing becomes the thing that I love maybe more than the music. The music is just sort of a mechanism by which I get to experience the sharing, right? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, I, I find your live work just really entrancing it in, in a lot of cases. It's, it's simpler than some of your recorded material, but sometimes it also has, to me, it has a real depth. And I wonder how do you approach live performance that opens the door for that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Well, thanks for the nice words. I, I try to make it as live as I can, which is a struggle with electronic music, as you know. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, you know, many of the sounds that I create are not made by playing anything. They're made by mangling. Some recording I've done, you know, I'll, I'll start with a microphone. It'll go into the computer and it'll end up getting, you know, mulched. Right. And so, you know, how do you play that live? Well, certain tricks I use looping delays and I'll use feedback putting putting things into each other until they build up big walls of sound and stuff like that. But, and you did mention that the live performances are usually simpler. The the best ones are for me, completely improvised where I'm, I'm completely jettisoning jettisoning all rhythm even, and just allowing the, the texture to flow like, like lava down a hillside, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Right. And, so, you know, a lot of it is really ignoring the ideas of perfection, but trying to be as musical and listening as possible and trying to be as much in the moment, both not focusing on making sound, but focusing on listening while I make sound, and steering energy as much as possible in the form of sound, but it becomes something other than sound. Really what I'm trying to do is to shape air. It's, it's, it's vibration at this point. It's just, it's energy. And if I can make a sort of plasma that's somehow floating in the room that you could almost touch, then I think I've somehow succeeded with my goal. But the, the best moments are when I'm not really there anymore. It's just, there's something happening. I think probably my best example came out on the album Calling Down the Sky. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>It was an improv in Denver, actually, a house concert in 2003. And, and that was one of those things where somehow, you know, there's these times when the music just makes you, the music makes me, and, and it's amazing when that happens. Another thing I could say about the concert thing, I mean, it's, you should be very proud of yourself for getting out and playing live. That is a rare thing for electronic music, and it is needed to be more, more people need to do that right now. Everybody can make an album in their bedroom. It's easy. There's no need to just, you know, to just release albums every week because we certainly could make an album every week. Right. There's a lot fewer people going out and performing to other people. What I like about actual performance is that it is, it is the, it is an anti virtualization, if that makes sense, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>It is an action with people in a community, in a room, physically, bodies breathing the same air. That is something that we are losing as a culture. And I'm afraid that, if people become completely virtualized, they just move more and more into their head. They lose a sense of what this planet is that we're on, and the, the very fragile nature of, of the, the nurturing that, that the planet does for us. A lot of what my obsessions have been about in the last, well, actually my whole career probably, but more consciously the last 20 years has been, trying to create an antidote to the virtual, which is ironic because music is a non-physical art form. It's, you know, there's no <span style="color:red" data-ts="3442.79" data-end_ts="3443.14" title="3442.79" id=c_"3442.79">__there__</span> there, right. But performance is physical and performance is an amazing enact enactment of the shamanic potential within the musical language. And if we're trying to create a language of music that is dealing with energy and dealing with internal experience, then tapping into that historical role that music played as, as a community storytelling and as a community trance ritual as it is still used in some cultures as in Indonesian galon or as in, you know, west African drumming. You know, these are perhaps non 21st century cultures in some ways. But, but we have a lot that we're losing as we move more and more into a completely abstracted society of information. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, yeah. You know, I guess, again, I hadn't really thought of of live performance <span style="color:red" data-ts="3509.92" data-end_ts="3510.14" title="3509.92" id=c_"3509.92">__as__</span> a de virtualization, but it, but it certainly makes sense even though it, even <laugh>, even the process of putting together performance has a certain virtual nature to it in that people find out that I'm playing because I'll post something up on Facebook or something mm-hmm. <affirmative>, you know, and so it's almost like leveraging the virtual in order to make the non-virtual happen. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Yeah. Yeah. Well, what's fun is to take something like Facebook or like some social network and then to, to break through the, through the tissue paper of it and actually start having real friendships. And when, when you have real friends on there, then they, they're people that you actually know. But you know, of course this could be scary saying this to a parent with, you know, teenagers, <laugh>, you know, you some people who probably are just creeps and you really don't want your teenage daughter to ever go and meet in person. But, as <laugh> as, adults, we can hopefully learn, who's scary and who isn't, and, become actual community, you know, I think that there is a role that, that this outreach of like-minded people, you know, can, can link up together right. And actually, and actually become a, a true community. And so there's, we can de virtualize those things as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, I, and also I think one, one of the things that, that, primarily virtual, primarily virtu virtual life, boy, I wanted to somehow say primarily virtuous, and that's not at all what I'm about to say, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b><laugh>. I would never pretend <span style="color:red" data-ts="3611.14" data-end_ts="3611.26" title="3611.14" id=c_"3611.14">__it__</span> be virtuous <laugh>. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But, a primarily, primarily vir life kind of does, is it breaks down, it breaks down civility in so many different ways, and not just in the, ooh, I can say mean things to people, although that's pretty prevalent, but, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Tolerating different ideas, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Tolerating different ideas, and also being empathetic. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, you see very, you, it seems very difficult for people to be empathetic, towards people that they text with. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>There's a lot of, obviously the technology is incredible these days, and we, you know, I'm not throwing it out. I, I'm very, I use it all the time myself and, and the, the dominance of the internet in our modern existence is, has made it easier for an independent, you know, artist like me to, to, to get my message out. I don't require record companies to release my music anymore, and I can communicate with listeners directly. This is fantastic. And what, what I like about real community and when people use the technology to enhance real community, you know, that's, that's wonderful. I, but I guess what I'm referring to you, when you're talking about civility, for example, let's say you go to a regular coffee shop and hang out there for half an hour a day, and you get to know certain people, and you get in conversations with somebody who has different belief systems than you, you know, let's say somebody who's, you know, the opposite political leaning or, you know, pro or anti <span style="color:red" data-ts="3709.85" data-end_ts="3710.27" title="3709.85" id=c_"3709.85">__eating__</span> meat or carrying guns or something like that. Right? Right. You can't just sit there and snark at them with a text. You, you have to actually engage with them. And you see the humanity of a person who has different belief systems than you. When we have these social networks that help us to find our own cohorts and, and belief structures, then all it does is reinforces people's, belief structures rather than 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Reinforces the wall. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Right. Rather than tempering them with humanity. And so actual physical community, you can't just sit there, you know, and yell at somebody in a coffee shop for being, you know, a right wing gun, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3749.3" data-end_ts="3749.5" title="3749.3" id=c_"3749.3">__nut__</span> meat eater, blah, blah, blah. And they're not gonna yell at you, you know, for being some, you know, what <span style="color:red" data-ts="3754.14" data-end_ts="3754.46" title="3754.14" id=c_"3754.14">__should__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3754.51" data-end_ts="3754.86" title="3754.51" id=c_"3754.51">__Macau__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3754.86" data-end_ts="3754.98" title="3754.86" id=c_"3754.86">__it__</span>, you know, Prius's driving something or other <laugh> and 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, I noticed which one of those you could come up with quickly and which ones you couldn't 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Answer, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3763.18" data-end_ts="3763.34" title="3763.18" id=c_"3763.18">__trying__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3763.34" data-end_ts="3763.38" title="3763.34" id=c_"3763.34">__to__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3763.38" data-end_ts="3763.42" title="3763.38" id=c_"3763.38">__find__</span> stereotypes. That would be, it would be very typical around Silicon Valley <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>But, but, you know, stereotypes not withstanding, whichever they are, the point is that, that there's a human face in, in those belief systems. And, and I think that what's going on right now is because of the increasingly solitary nature of people's, developing belief systems and how they only sit there and get reinforced by people who they're searching for on the internet. That's where a lot of civility breaks down. And it becomes <span style="color:red" data-ts="3799.78" data-end_ts="3799.9" title="3799.78" id=c_"3799.78">__a__</span>, a vicious circle, really, because as civility breaks down, people want less and less to be around people they think different from, right. So, I, I don't know. I, I've been increasingly fascinated with, with aspects of, for example, food politics. I'm an omnivore, I'm a wine drinker, and I've made wine for 10 years and, you know, but yet I've, I've been involved in the slow food movement for about 10 or 15 years now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>And what I really like about this approach of using, something that everyone has to do, which is eat, as a means of communicating community and healthy behaviors, I find it really interesting. They, that slow food speaks about the, the pleasure principle, or basically you show people that becoming more aesthetically involved in your experience of, of something you have to do every day of eating. This involvement actually makes you slow down. It makes you eat better, healthier, and, and you also support farmers locally because you realize you want fresher food, right? You want the farmers to get paid well so they can grow fresher food. And what happens is a very sneaky little way of breaking down some of the, corporate mega food monsters, you know, the Monsanto 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="3883.93" data-end_ts="3884.22" title="3883.93" id=c_"3883.93">__Have__</span>. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>You, you end up pleasing yourself and doing better for the world and enhancing communities. So, you know, for example, we have a, an edible landscape in the backyard. We have raised beds and drip irrigation. We grow our own vegetables. And, when the zucchinis come online, which they're doing crazy right now, we're getting about eight zucchinis a day. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, we play doorbell ditch with the neighbors. We drop off zucchinis at their door, you know, <laugh> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3911.42" data-end_ts="3911.7" title="3911.42" id=c_"3911.42">__ring__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Ring the bell and run away. And they, and they open the door and they say, oh, if it only was a bag of 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Shit, there's a, the size of a leg. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>But, you know, this kind of thing is what I mean about community and freshness, and there's a joy in it. What we're doing is, is spreading a kind of, well, a non <span style="color:red" data-ts="3929.34" data-end_ts="3929.9" title="3929.34" id=c_"3929.34">__virtuality__</span>, again, it's a real visceral existing aspect. Grounding feet on the ground, understanding how dirt feeds us, how we have to feed the dirt in return or else it dies. This actually very deeply informs my music, this approach to, to the earth. And, you know, I, a lot of people lump me into the old category of space music, and I've often answered to that by saying, well, actually it's earth music. Right. You know, it's maybe inner space music, but it's, but it's music of this planet and and of our species. And it speaks a lot to, to my sense of humor about the process of life and the, the amazing miracle of life bubbling up on this planet, you know, which is a crazy thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>You know, if you, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3977" data-end_ts="3977.22" title="3977" id=c_"3977">__now__</span>, now that we're out looking for planets in other solar systems, and we're starting to realize that probably on average every sun in the universe has at least one planet that's <span style="color:red" data-ts="3987.72" data-end_ts="3987.94" title="3987.72" id=c_"3987.72">__in__</span> insane, I mean, re regarding what we thought about the lonely position of life just 15, 20 years ago, now we can really imagine that there could be a million planets within our part of the galaxy where there's something growing, perhaps just some slime mold or some weird little green purple bacterium thing, you know? But the non unique status of us on this planet, I think is, is gonna be one of the, the, the deepest long-term changes that we're experiencing right now in the century, that <span style="color:red" data-ts="4028.48" data-end_ts="4028.7" title="4028.48" id=c_"4028.48">__the__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="4028.7" data-end_ts="4028.94" title="4028.7" id=c_"4028.7">__changes__</span>, the, the place that, that we are, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Universe. Where 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>We think the universe. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Universe, yeah. Universe. So, I have used up an awful lot of your time, and I really appreciate this. So I, especially after this discussion, I have a desire to have a non-virtual experience with you. And frankly, about the last six times that we've met, it's been at the Nam Show, which is 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Insane 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, which is, which is, it's, it's sort of like, if a Red Lobster was filled with used car salesman, that's, that's how romantic of a interface. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>It's crazy. Yeah, no, I know. Yeah. It's impossible to have a conversation there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So when is the next time that you are going to be touring the earth to do some, some, performances? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>I am hoping and planning, in fact, to be on the road again, doing my once every three year loop around North America, in springtime in 2015. Oh, oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Fantastic. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>I've already arranged a house concert in, you're in Denver, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, just outside of Denver. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Good. I've arranged a house concert just outside of Denver, if you know, the artist, Ana, it's at his house. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yes. Yeah. Jesse. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Jesse. So <span style="color:red" data-ts="4102.94" data-end_ts="4103.1" title="4102.94" id=c_"4102.94">__are__</span> we playing at Jesse's house? We sometimes get 20 or 30 people there. It's really intimate and everybody brings some food and we have a potluck. <span style="color:red" data-ts="4109.48" data-end_ts="4109.7" title="4109.48" id=c_"4109.48">__Ah__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That'll be fantastic. I'll be looking forward to that for sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>This has been a pleasure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, it's been a pleasure for me. I am, I am gonna like go back and immediately listen to this because you have provided me with so many inspirational thoughts. And, and again, the opportunity for me to talk to people like you is, is wonderful because every single time I talk to someone, I, I grow in some way. And so I really appreciate this, opportunity. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>It's been a real pleasure, and thank you. It's, you know, you're, an old friend in a non-virtual way for many years now, and it's, I don't think we've ever been able to have a, a thoughtful, deep conversation like this. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I know. This has been fantastic, so, okay. Thank you very much, and I will talk to you again soon, I suspect. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Thank you so much, Darwin All right, we'll take, take care. Talk to you later. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. I'm out here in Santa Fe looking to get ready to do my performance this evening. I wanna again, thank Robert Rich for his interview, and thank you guys for listening. If you are in Santa Fe area, please stop by this evening at Eleo. I'm going to be doing a little performance. This is Sunday night, of course. And otherwise, I have to get <span style="color:red" data-ts="4191.74" data-end_ts="4191.98" title="4191.74" id=c_"4191.74">__cutting__</span>. So I'll see you next week.
