<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. This week I have the opportunity to talk to somebody I've known for quite a long time. In fact, he sort of got to be a pro in the music industry about the <span style="color:red" data-ts="23.235" data-end_ts="23.475" title="23.235" id=c_"23.235">__same__</span>, same time I started as well. I remember the first time I really met him face-to-face was at an <span style="color:red" data-ts="29.395" data-end_ts="29.555" title="29.395" id=c_"29.395">__AM__</span> show, which ought to tell you a lot. His name is Dave Hill Jr And he has done a number of things. So over the years he's been an author, he's worked, at Ableton in sales and sales management and marketing and brand development. He left there and moved to Isotope where he's been working for the last many years. And so with that, I wanna say hi to Dave Hill Jr Hi, Dave. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave Hill Jr: </b>Hey, Darwin Good, good. Thanks. Thanks for having me on your podcast. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, well thanks a lot for, for being here. I really You bet. I thought it was a great opportunity to talk a little bit outside of the range of where I normally interview, because I interview a lot of people that are like, they make modular systems or they're musicians, or they're coders or whatever. And, you come at things from a very different direction. So why don't you kick off by talking about the things you do, what you do for, for a living, for a gig. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Yeah. Well, what I what I do for a living these days is, probably primarily a marketing focus with a bit of sales and business development. And basically, you know, I have been super lucky to work at companies like Ableton and Isotope to be able to tell interesting brand stories and really build up the awareness out in the market of the interesting things going on with the products. You know, so it's kind of a joy and a pleasure, but, but it's also, it's a lot of hard work. Yeah. Funny enough, I think we, we met at the NAMM Show, because we both, are true music, musicians and geeks, <span style="color:red" data-ts="131.975" data-end_ts="132.195" title="131.975" id=c_"131.975">__at__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="132.295" data-end_ts="132.515" title="132.295" id=c_"132.295">__at__</span> as well 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Equal <span style="color:red" data-ts="134.315" data-end_ts="134.395" title="134.315" id=c_"134.315">__part__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>That's how I, yeah. An equal part maybe depending on the day, who knows which side's winning. And, I think, yeah, so that's it. It's interesting that I've sort of used some of my creative, aspects or, or talents in, in the business side, and, and it's, it's done really well for me. I've had a great career so far. It's really enjoyable. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. So you've been working with some great companies over this time, and, but before that you even, you kind of got your, got your bones in the industry as a writer. <span style="color:red" data-ts="166.255" data-end_ts="166.475" title="166.255" id=c_"166.255">__Yep__</span>. You wrote some of the earliest books that were available about Ableton Live, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Yeah, yeah. Funny enough, I, I'm like the accidental author, <laugh> that, you know, I didn't set out in this, life to become a writer. It probably goes back even further. I, you know, I grew up in a family business. My dad makes cardboard boxes for a living and packaging supplies, and so that made me want to become a drummer. So I, I said I, didn't wanna make boxes for a living. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, okay. Alright. I was just gonna say, how did seeing your dad make boxes? Turn you into a drummer, but I, okay, I get it. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b><laugh>. Well, it's, it's my dry humor, that rarely is understood. So, you know, I think the, yeah, you know, I just, I looked at the box business and it was certainly a great way to make a living. And my dad's very good at it, and I just rebelled like every teenage kid and said, I'm gonna play drums. And I was totally inspired to play music and spent, oh my God, I don't know how many hours, practicing and studying with some really amazing musicians and, you know, playing with all kinds of folks in Seattle. I grew up in the nineties in Seattle, which is, you know, you can imagine the, characters and people I was playing music with. It was pretty awesome. You know, I think at, at some point I felt like I had played everywhere possible in Seattle and kind of getting toward the late nineties, I wanted to move to New York. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>So I, I, I picked up and moved to New York and started to, seek out musical fortune in New York City as you do. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And that's really freaking hard, by the way, <laugh>. So in doing that, I, you know, had sort of happened to tour with a guitarist who was an editor <span style="color:red" data-ts="274.265" data-end_ts="274.485" title="274.265" id=c_"274.265">__in__</span> chief at, remix Magazine. And, he started to, which doesn't exist anymore. I think it's, it's totally like a fashion magazine or something now called. But there was a magazine called Remix that was a spinoff of, electronic musician that was basically, you know, really catering to the electronic music trend that was starting to happen in the late nineties. And, you know, like drum and bass groups and, and, trip hop and all, you know, things like that that were happening. And so they needed a author to basically write about all the music software technology that was happening. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>And he <span style="color:red" data-ts="310.605" data-end_ts="310.765" title="310.605" id=c_"310.605">__had__</span>, I was tinkering around with every sort of piece of software I could get my hands on because they were like a much easier way to work with samples and loops. And as a drummer, I was absolutely, as a drummer, I was, you know, totally fascinated with playing with loops. You know, I had bought an EMAX when I was 15, so I had like, you know, I was always into samplers and loop devices, and so I got quite into Acid Pro the, back when it was Sound Forge or, sorry, the Sonic Foundry. Sonic 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Foundry, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Yeah. So Sonic Foundry product, acid was a, just an amazing product way ahead of its time. And so I started getting really good at that. I was probably, I'd definitely say a power user. And, so I wrote an article for Remix Magazine, and that started my writing career. So I started then going to the NAMM show and doing more and more stories and writing for all sorts of different magazines about music technology, and even had a brief column in Modern Drummer called Drums and Wires, that was, you know, talking about how to embrace looping and loop technology and, and that sort of thing. You know, at some point, I guess it was year 2000, 2001, I met Gerhard and Robert from Ableton, and they were showing this, this, you know, kind of the next generation of acid, really to me that was non-linear. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>And I was like, ah, that is the thing I've been wanting my whole life as a drummer. And so I fell in love with it, and I think I'm, I'm in New York City and now, and I'm in love with Ableton Live, and I'm trying, I'm working crappy day jobs trying to stay afloat. And I basically, pitched a publisher to be able to write that book and, just said, listen, this Ableton, I just felt it in my heart and my gut. I said, this is gonna do something. This is totally new. This is totally gonna revolutionize the, this is the way musicians want to be working with digital audio workstations. You know, this is not, not the way that an engineer would approach it. And I didn't have those engineering skills, didn't have the ears for it, you know, and, and the training. So yeah. So I just through, my own probably naivete and, and Gumption wrote this book, and, maybe the funny story is I think I released Ableton Live Two Power in like, I wanna say August of I think 2003. I think Ableton released Live three, the next version of Live like two months later, <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Of course, that's how it 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Always <span style="color:red" data-ts="450.605" data-end_ts="450.725" title="450.605" id=c_"450.605">__happens__</span>. It was not, not great for book sales, you know, <laugh>, but, but, certainly good for my career somehow. Right. Sort of an accidental, you know, so that's why I guess I say I'm like the accidental author who then became like the accidental business builder and marketer and, and sales, person. So, so, yeah. So that, that I was, you know, product evangelist number one. I was the first guy they hired in the US and I built up the office and, and had a really fun time telling the story, the many stories around that product, which is now, you know, so well known. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Indeed. Well, I'm <laugh> there's a lot there that, that I want to ask you about, but first of all, you are one of the few people who has at least admitted to starting off as a drummer, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b><laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, you know? Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>I, I still play drums. I'm still like, that's probably my, my truest most serious hobby these days. But I, you know, I take, I take it very seriously, and yeah, I'm in love with playing the drums. It's just, I think it's a wonderful, magical thing still, you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Know? Yeah. Well that's, that's, that's fantastic. The thing that's interesting to me is that you are actually, you <span style="color:red" data-ts="523.565" data-end_ts="523.685" title="523.565" id=c_"523.565">__are__</span> toying around with technology at a time where I would say a lot of music technology was almost adverse to drummers. I mean, you mentioned the idea of moving to Ableton Live. One of the things that was really exciting was that it was, you know, there was this non-linear component. How were you, when you were working with acid and some of these other things, how could you integrate drumming with something that had to be this, like, timeline that was stretched out with a mouse or whatever? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Yeah. You know, I think it's like, like anything that was sequenced back in the day is, is you, you know, you would just pre sequence things and you would perform along with 'em, and you would, you know, probably have sections in a song where you would be more, be more open or be able to do some improvisation. But, you know, I studied with a lot of jazz musicians and jazz drummers and, and whatnot and, and, I think had that aesthetic of like, you know, I really wanted to have the freedom to improvise. So, you know, initially I started off being the frustrated jazz drummer playing along to the linear sequence. And then when I met Ableton, I was like, oh, this is, this is awesome. I can actually improvise. And, you know, I was triggering different scenes or groups of loops and being able to improvise like, like you would with a band. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I was, I was going to ask if you, if you got involved with like, a lot of triggering setups. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Yeah, I've experimented a ton in the past. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Were you using like one of those drum cat type things? Or were you using sensors on the 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="617.845" data-end_ts="617.965" title="617.845" id=c_"617.845">__<crosstalk>__</span>? <span style="color:red" data-ts="617.965" data-end_ts="618.045" title="617.965" id=c_"617.965">__I__</span>, yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. No, I, I bought a drum cat, I think the month that thing came out. In fact, I know Mario, <span style="color:red" data-ts="624.385" data-end_ts="624.605" title="624.385" id=c_"624.385">__the__</span>, the inventor of the drum cat is a friend of mine, and, and he, he is, he was just totally ahead of his time too. That that's an amazing product. Yeah. I love the drum cat. I just recently got it resurfaced and it's Oh, nice. It's amazing. Yeah. It's the same. And how cool is that, that like 30 years later I get the thing resurfaced and it's like the same product I had and for like, you know, a fraction of the cost that you can actually go to the same person and have them re-skin it, you know? Right. It's pretty, pretty awesome. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. In a 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Day of disposable products, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. But now that actually brings up sort of another thing, which is you have been involved in music technology, both from a professional, but also a user standpoint. Well, for a lot of the history of 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>My whole life, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, right? A lot of the history of you, right? Yeah. And so you've got a chance to see a lot of things come and go, and it's really heartening when you see something like something like the drum cat, stay, you know, stay a part of people's repertoire for a long period of time. Conversely, there are an awful lot of things that, you know, almost by the time it's packaged up and shipped to you, it's, it becomes, it becomes obsolete. In your mind, what is it that with something like the drum cat, what is it that makes that have longevity when other hardware doesn't? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>I think, craftsmanship, you know, was definitely a part of it. I think, think Mario and his team, I think they worked pretty hard to, his team of like two, I think, worked really hard to make sure that the, the triggering was really spot on and wasn't doing a lot of false triggering, I forget the word for that, where they kind of crosstalk and in a bad way. And I think the, the, the brain of the, of the device was just really, you know, well imagined. And, and, you know, Mario's a player. He, he plays Broadway shows still. I think, at least last time I talked with him, he is still doing some shows in New York, Broadway, and, and, you know, even like a, sitting in with the <span style="color:red" data-ts="746.285" data-end_ts="746.765" title="746.285" id=c_"746.285">__Rockette__</span> show and you know, NBC <span style="color:red" data-ts="749.735" data-end_ts="750.085" title="749.735" id=c_"749.735">__Music__</span> Hall there. And so he's, you know, he knew the challenges that drummers have and the types of things that drummers would want to do with the device. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>So it's a classic, you know, like, invention much in the same way Ableton was invented by two techno musicians, right. Who had a, had a unique problem about wanting to perform, you know, different arrangements of their music each night, depending on, you know, the crowd and, and how they were feeling. And, you know, so they, that necessity is the mother of invention is a, a true statement. Sure. And I think, you know, that helped make that device. So I, I know that there's lots of other great products that have been made also by musicians and made by people who, you know, are living it as well as making the products. But for some reason, the, I think these, in these cases, at least with the drum cat and Ableton, which I never probably imagined comparing those in the same sense, <laugh>, but, but they, you know, I think really nailed it. Right. You know, for a lot of reasons. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Certainly myself working with, working with the Ableton team, when I do what I see is consistently, I see this desire to have like high, high quality output, and you've been working with Isotope, and I think that's another company that's really, yeah. You really see in their products the craftsmanship and the pride that they put in making the things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Yeah. No, absolutely. Isotope <span style="color:red" data-ts="831.485" data-end_ts="831.605" title="831.485" id=c_"831.485">__and__</span> Ableton have Remi, they remind me of each other in a lot of ways. And I think why I was able to translate my skills here was just because I saw a lot of the very same core passion and, craftsmanship, you know, at the company. So yeah, isotope has a really high bar for the sound quality and the, and the user experience. Right. And that, I think that that's helped, very much in a similar way with the, that craftsmanship, angle. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So I wanna go back and talk a little bit about your early career as a writer, because Yeah, I think a lot of people are kind of fascinated by the ability to, to do that writing sort of seems mystical. And even if you're an accidental writer, you still end up having to write <laugh>, you know? Yeah. So, when, when you approached the idea of making a book this the Ableton Live Power Book series, first of all, did you see yourself at that point as having been ha being a power user? Or were you gonna have to learn on the fly? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>I think I, I thought I was a power user, and I, probably was a little, naive there as well. I think I didn't realize how much more of a power user I needed to be to finish the book. And then even after I got the book out, I think there were still some things in there wrong that were, you know, where I made, I described things inaccurately, or there were things where, oh, actually if I talked to Robert for an afternoon, I would totally, you know, do this differently. Right. So, yeah. But I, I was a power user probably, at least in the United States, I was probably one of a few people who was really a power user. 'cause I think the problem Ableton had back with Live Two is a lot of people just didn't get the power of the program. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Right. They were looking at it right away and comparing it to Acid Pro. They were comparing it to Pro Tools or, or whatever they were used to, and just saying, oh, this is a toy. This is not serious, you know, creation tool. And I was like, you're, you know, wanted to scream, saying you're missing the point, <laugh>, you know? So, yeah. So I ended up, you know, I think up on Gerhard's suggestion, probably the year after I wrote the book was when I really became a power user. And, you know, going to Berlin a dozen times and talking to Gerhard and, and the team there <span style="color:red" data-ts="971.545" data-end_ts="971.765" title="971.545" id=c_"971.545">__of__</span> really talented people showing me all kinds of tips and tricks of like how to get inside. That's when I really, I think, you know, got to a pretty good place with it. Sure. But on being a writer, you were sort of alluding to that, and I think, yeah, I had, I definitely had to approach becoming a writer in a very similar way of like, you just have to work at it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="989.685" data-end_ts="989.805" title="989.685" id=c_"989.685">__I__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="989.805" data-end_ts="989.925" title="989.805" id=c_"989.805">__guess__</span>. I remember, you know, buying every sort of how to write book I could get for a while, but you then you start to find the ones that really click for you and, you know, the Williams Zinzer on writing well, or Right. You know, the elements of style and all that stuff you were supposed to read in high school. I, I really embraced it this time because I was doing it for a living, even writing for the magazines. So I think, you know, every article was a new chance to kind of learn a little bit better how to write. And, and I should mention, I married an English teacher <span style="color:red" data-ts="1019.735" data-end_ts="1020.085" title="1019.735" id=c_"1019.735">__who's__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, that helps. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>It's super brilliant. And she, she's the real writer in the family, <laugh>, I just kind of was the journeyman who was out making a buck. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Making a buck. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So, now I think it's interesting that you, you were writing for Remix Meg because there was a, there was a time when there was some really intriguing magazines. There was remix, scratch was being published at about that time. I don't know if you remember that. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Sure. Of 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Course. It was like, it was like for the Hip hop beat maker. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, which I thought was, I, I found that magazine <span style="color:red" data-ts="1054.645" data-end_ts="1054.765" title="1054.645" id=c_"1054.645">__to__</span> be brilliant. I thought Remix was brilliant. There was, there was a magazine called New Media, which covered like crazy visual programs and stuff like that. I love that stuff. And it all sort of evaporated, and it didn't seem to necessarily evaporate because of the internet. Mm-Hmm. Although, although maybe it did, I don't know. What, what's your, what are your, what's your vision of it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>I, I was just gonna say, remember Magazine, Darwin you know, <laugh> <laugh>. But yeah, I think, you know, to me a little bit, I, I think it was definitely the pressure of the internet and publishing was, you know, in the midst of its big change then. And I, although I saying that I am also excited to see, you know, magazines now, like Sound on Sound and Tape <span style="color:red" data-ts="1100.105" data-end_ts="1100.325" title="1100.105" id=c_"1100.105">__Hop__</span> and, and even the future, like future music, computer music, like, some of these magazines have thrived and even grown. I mean, I think Sound On Sound looks bigger to me than ever. And, and Tape Op is still the solid read every time. Right. So they have <span style="color:red" data-ts="1115.205" data-end_ts="1115.485" title="1115.205" id=c_"1115.205">__stayed__</span>, you know, there's been some of that. But I think, yeah, that type of, maybe that genre of magazine has all translated to online. Like, I think if people are making electronic music and applications that are, you know, basically living on a computer, I think they're just more aptt to jump out to a blog, more apt to, you know, just like get their knowledge from YouTube and wherever else, you know, they're, they're cruising for the forums or whatever. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>As you can imagine, I'm hoping that they're looking to podcasts <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>There you go. Of course they're coming to the Art and Music and Technology podcast. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yes. That's where the Fountain of All Knowledge. Right. I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Love <span style="color:red" data-ts="1150.515" data-end_ts="1150.805" title="1150.515" id=c_"1150.515">__Cast__</span>, actually. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's, it's, yeah, I do too. I listen to 'em all day, which is, I mean, I actually got into it because I was so influenced by some of the podcasters I was listening to. Right. So now I'm curious, it used to be that the process of launching a product or extending a product's reach or whatever it used to be, that that was a matter of being buddies with the people at, at the magazines, you know, working with them, looking for ways, you know, buying advertising. It seems like that whole world has changed massively. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Yeah. I think, you know, we're in the age of the consumer now, right? Where, it's, you have to actually make a good product <laugh>, and you have to actually price it fairly. And I think you have to, you know, do your best to deliver on the value that you're, you have to, you can't just do your best. You have to deliver the value you're promising to the customer to, to have the reach you want. Because I think nothing travels faster now than word of mouth. It used to be word of mouth was very slow. And I think that word of mouth now is, is, fast as like a tweet away, you know, from right. From where someone's, standing. And I think that that's, so, it, it has changed. Definitely. I think it's, it's not the days of trying to make sure that the magazines cover your product. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>I mean, that's certainly important because I think magazines, they do still have experts on their staff who have seen everything. Right. And so it is helpful to have them, you know, chime in about what they see, and they often point out flaws or, or ways to improve things that only the, you know, the really experienced folks will see, and not every customer will see. But that being said, you know, there's nothing better than a customer review who's, you see that in. That's, that's what gets me up in the morning. It's like you see a customer who's empowered to do something mm-Hmm. <affirmative> that they couldn't do before, and they now can do that with your product. And then that's just like a, it's an amazing feeling. Whether it's ozone, you know, they're able to master a song, or it's Ableton, they're able to create a piece of music, or I think that's just, that's been the, the fun thing. And then that spreads like wildfire and you're able to reach more customers because that passion, that excitement, I think it really does work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. So, since I've got a marketeer on the line, though, I want to ask some questions Sure. That I think we all wonder about. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But I would like to hear your, so I, I appreciate that. It, it helps you wake up to hear a customer being empowered, but the internet also empowers the asshole 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b><laugh>. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And it makes it so that somebody, whether they've even tried your product or not, is empowered to call it crap. Mm-Hmm. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1317.805" data-end_ts="1317.845" title="1317.805" id=c_"1317.805">__<affirmative>__</span> and or is empowered to, and has as louder of voice as anybody to be able to say, this is junk. Mm-Hmm, <affirmative>, or This doesn't work, or This isn't as good as, you know, <laugh>, whatever, you know? Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I, and I'm just wondering how, so if, if the customer reviews help you wake up, how do these things not make you want to just crawl into the swamp? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>I guess it's a numbers game. And, to me, I've been probably, I'll say, I'll take a little credit, I'll say half lucky and half choosy about the companies I work for. And I think if I would say that, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1358.845" data-end_ts="1359.245" title="1358.845" id=c_"1358.845">__buying__</span>, I mean, I remember early days at Ableton, we would look at the forum and there were folks there of course, complaining about features that were missing. At that time. There had only been a couple years of development. There wasn't time to compete with, say, the latest version of Pro Tools or logic. So there's always that negative thing there. And I think it's easy to get disheartened, but I guess I just see so much more positive. A lot of times in the negative, you can see a pretty decent thread of positive of that if they just, they're just maybe not understanding it, or actually they're, they're really pushing you to develop to the next thing you need to do, and you should listen to them. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>And it's a positive. It's like, I, it's, it's a great thing. They care that much <span style="color:red" data-ts="1399.185" data-end_ts="1399.405" title="1399.185" id=c_"1399.185">__Now__</span>, I mean, speaking to the, the asshole thing, <laugh>, yeah. I mean, yeah, I mean, that's everywhere, right? I mean, that's, that that can happen. But I, I do still think it's, I, I guess I'm an optimist to my grave that I, I think it, there's always a bit more of the, the people that are actually gonna spend the energy talking about you and talking to your product tend to do it more for good because they're excited. Then, you know, after you kick a dead horse for a while, it just kind of gets old. Right. And I've even seen like foreign threads turn around where it starts out being a negative thing, and then after a few dozen comments, people kind of go, well, it's not that bad. You know, you know, and they almost like self-Correct. You know? Right. Like, God, what else can, we've all disparaged this product now for the last day and a half. Maybe we ought to like stop. It's getting kind of boring. But yeah, it doesn't get me down too much. I, I think it's, you know, I think it's something that I say, I guess you would need that corrective part of the, the system feedback mechanism, right? Yeah. Otherwise, it's like you, you're not being honest with yourself. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's important. Well, so now in your long history of doing marketing and, and actually it, you know, some of your earlier work would've been kind of in the early days of us all trying to figure out how these forums and stuff are gonna help, you know, interact with product development stuff. Did you ever like really do anything boneheaded? Did you, ev did you ever like just jump on somebody that was complaining or, or, or is that just a temptation? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>I've done lots of boneheaded things. Dar I just dunno if I've done 'em in forums. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1494.345" data-end_ts="1494.565" title="1494.345" id=c_"1494.345">__Ah__</span>, okay. <laugh>, I think, I think I remember one thread at at Ableton where somebody got pretty personal about me and, and, the book I think, and the whatever. And they were just kind of like going on and on. I just kinda, I, I think I just kind of took it too hard and said, okay, I'm outta here. Like, I'm not gonna participate in this. This is, you know, I'm just trying to be helpful and, you know, took my ball and went home sort of thing. Right, right. You know, and you know, looking back, it's like I just say, well, they got my goat, you know? Right. They certainly got me. So, good on them. But no, I, when you're in an anonymous world on the internet, I think you need to treat it a little differently and understand that like, if you take it too seriously, you're playing in the, this may sound bad, but you're playing in like the, the ghetto, or you're playing in the back alley a little bit. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>You know, like, don't, it's the wild west. Or maybe that's a better way to say it. So it's, you can't, if you take it too seriously and you get all bent outta shape emotionally about, you know, what's going on in there, I think it's like you have to really be objective and, and say, you know, what's really, what are they really saying? What's the motivation there? And, and do they have a good point or not? It's hard. I guess <span style="color:red" data-ts="1560.185" data-end_ts="1560.405" title="1560.185" id=c_"1560.185">__it__</span>, it's, for me, it's hard when it gets personal. And I think that's the tricky thing on the interwebs is that you can have a public figure or somebody who's even, I, I wouldn't say I am, but like, I slightly resemble a public figure or something, or people would know, or they would talk about Gerhard or different people, or isotope folks here. And then it starts to get like, kind of personal. And that's, that's when I feel like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1581.505" data-end_ts="1581.725" title="1581.505" id=c_"1581.505">__ah__</span>, it's not fair. Right. We're, they know my name, but I don't know their name. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>They're beat maker 1 0 5, you know, X. And I'm like, I don't know you, and you're telling me I'm an, I'm an idiot, but I don't know, it's kind of weird. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now I wanna kind of plumb your brain a little bit about another thing that is in my bonnet right now. Okay. I am a big, big fan, big user of like modular gear, but I've also, I like many people have been sort of drawn in by the new or a new golden age of hardware. You've always been situated pretty squarely in the world of software companies. And I'm wondering, from within the world of software companies, what is your view of the new love of hardware? Or do you think it's, do you think it's going to in some way affect the software world? Or do you think that everybody will coexist happily ever after? I mean, what <span style="color:red" data-ts="1643.485" data-end_ts="1643.645" title="1643.485" id=c_"1643.485">__is__</span>, what is your feeling about hardware in lieu of the fact that you've done a lot of amazing stuff with companies that have, have been software driven? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>It's probably just where my fascination lies. I, I'm more excited about technology and the future, I guess, than I am reproducing the past. And so I guess I've gravitated towards software 'cause it's kind of a natural obvious place for it. But I, I, I love hardware. And as a drummer, I mean, I get, you know, I buy like vintage drums and Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I just buy, I just <span style="color:red" data-ts="1674.165" data-end_ts="1674.285" title="1674.165" id=c_"1674.165">__buy__</span> like a 1920s black beauty, snare drum. That's Oh, nice. That's just an amazing drum. And, you know, I buy like old diligence symbols and so like for Yeah. A radio king snare drums like a 1950s <laugh>, you know, slingerland solid maple drum. So, so I love, I totally understand why people, you know, are affectionate towards their, their hardware of the past and where they, especially the ones who like, well, I made a hit record with this piece of gear, of course I'm gonna keep using that piece of gear. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Or Right. I, I spent so many hours lovingly programming the synth. I want to have something like that feels like that again, that I for sure get, I think for the, the new crop of customers and, and people, musicians and and creatives coming into the market these days. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1723.845" data-end_ts="1723.965" title="1723.845" id=c_"1723.845">__I__</span>, you know, I think there's a little bit of, there can be a little snake oil in <span style="color:red" data-ts="1727.365" data-end_ts="1727.525" title="1727.365" id=c_"1727.365">__the__</span>, here, this is the retro thing, and maybe it's really not that retro. It's like maybe it's, it's actually a re a remake of the past and you, you could actually get there much faster and cheaper with the software version. And then I, I don't know. But, but nothing replaces that tactile sense of hardware. And so I think, like, you know, hardware to me is, I totally get why that's the, that needs to be the thing all software companies remember, I think is that at the end of the day, a mouse and a computer are a horrible way to interact with a, a piece of music software. Right. Or audio software. So we gotta figure out the way that people will react to it. And if it takes, you know, a hardware or an old analog style feel to do that, then so be it. You know, that might help that person be creative. Sure. But, but I just, yeah. I just, I tend to probably gravitate towards software companies 'cause I love the forward thinking possibilities of what you can do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. And, and the cool thing about software is, is that software developers are free to try something and they don't have to manufacture a bunch of landfill Totally. In order to find out if people are into it or not. I think there's, there's really something to be said for that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Absolutely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now I'm curious though, 'cause there's some, some people that are already saying, why do we need more? What is it, what is it that we need more of? And I think you see this in like with Ableton right now spending a lot of focus on making these physical interfaces rather than drastically changing, Ableton Live. I've been a long-term ozone user and Mm-Hmm. I think, you know, until recently I was still using Ozone three because it sounded fantastic, right. <laugh>, but, you know, recently Vintage 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Vintage, a vintage Ozone <span style="color:red" data-ts="1833.685" data-end_ts="1833.925" title="1833.685" id=c_"1833.685">__product__</span>. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Vintage Ozone. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>A different type of vintage <span style="color:red" data-ts="1835.955" data-end_ts="1836.245" title="1835.955" id=c_"1835.955">__that__</span> our new vintage <laugh>. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So then I recently upgraded to, to the current version, and I I saw what was, what was enhancements and improvements and certainly sonically there was some differences. And I'm wondering, in the world, in the brave world of software development, where do you think, where do you think you're gonna start seeing innovation when, I mean, when it gets to the point that, you know, you're doing significant 32 bit recording and sound manipulation, and in a lot of cases 64 and sometimes even 128 bit, manipulation of those of that data, it starts, it starts running into the noise floor and you're, and Sure. And it's like diminishing returns, right? Yeah. Diminishing returns. Yeah. What do you think is gonna be the area of next amazement? That's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>A darn good question. <laugh> if, yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>If you only knew, huh? If, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>If I only knew, you know, I, I think I, I rely maybe my career and what I, what I'm good at Darwin I think is taking what brilliant engineers and and brilliant customers who, you know, and brilliant musicians and, and eng you know, audio engineers, post-production engineers <span style="color:red" data-ts="1912.835" data-end_ts="1913.125" title="1912.835" id=c_"1912.835">__with__</span> those cus those people collaborate to, with some ideas to make something new. And I'm good at helping take that to market and get that out there and, and, you know, tell the stories around that, what that is. I think I learned, I i many a day I have tried to play product manager and I've tried to say, well, you know what we should do, and here we need a, we need a new button over here, <laugh>. And, you know, boy, the folks at Isotope and Ableton have been more than patient to put up with me in that regard. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>But I think that it's hard to say. I, I do agree with you that it's at a very high level these days, and I guess when I look at what new products people are putting out and you see a lot of vintage synthesizer type, you know, products and emulations and and such, and you see, you know, kind of never an end to the amount of, of Plugin, that even our, you know, the variety of the same exact channel strip, a plugin by different companies, it does sort of, you wonder like, okay, what's next? But I think to me, it, it keeps coming back down to workflow and trying to make the computer actually feel like a, a musical place <laugh>, you know, for, for lack of a better word, it feels like it's still not, you know, I think Ableton's doing a lot to try and make the computer an instrument. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>And I think they've succeeded in a lot of ways, but I think that, still, or even <span style="color:red" data-ts="1997.945" data-end_ts="1998.165" title="1997.945" id=c_"1997.945">__an__</span> iPad, right, there's a lot of people thinking interesting iPad apps and you think, oh, everyone's just gonna start using these, but it just doesn't quite happen. And I think it's not yet. I think that's the still the mastery they're seeking. Like people aren't reinventing the piano and the guitar as often as, as we are sort of reinventing the way you make music on a computer every couple years. Right. And so I think we haven't quite got it to that mature state where it's like, oh, this is the way we're gonna do it. You know, it, it, it's still like, everybody has, we all have an idiosyncratic way of, of working and doing things on a computer and they don't, they, you <span style="color:red" data-ts="2034.245" data-end_ts="2034.325" title="2034.245" id=c_"2034.245">__know__</span>, making music or, or producing audio and it's, it's all different. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Like I think your setup is totally different than mine and mine is totally different from probably everyone here at isotopes, you know, so it's like unique still. And I think that whereas if you sit down with a guitar or a piano or you know, another instrument, you kind of know what you're getting and it might change <span style="color:red" data-ts="2053.605" data-end_ts="2053.845" title="2053.605" id=c_"2053.605">__this__</span>, the neck thickness might be different or the string gauge or something, but it's not like, you know, light years away. So I think that's where the innovation, so I know I'm going on and on, but I think that's where, to me, the innovation is the control, the right computer interface for all this, the right workflow and the real estate on the screen to how things, I think that's really important. And I know one thing at Isotope, and I know this is true at Ableton, was just a lot of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2079.365" data-end_ts="2079.605" title="2079.365" id=c_"2079.365">__think__</span> thinking going on around that workflow and that every decision you make on a design side is so essential because that's what the customers really where they're living. I feel like there's still room to innovate there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, and it's interesting because, you know, certainly we haven't defined the world of electronic music in a way that would allow there to be like the Suzuki method for Right. You know? Yeah. But maybe that's the point of electronic music is that it was never meant to be exactly that, but, yeah, maybe 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Yeah. Too wild to be tamed. Yeah. Right. <laugh>, I don't know, maybe 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. So, one last question <span style="color:red" data-ts="2119.225" data-end_ts="2119.445" title="2119.225" id=c_"2119.225">__and__</span> then I'll let you go. Sure. You've worked with two of the most innovative companies in the music space, and so let's take them off the plate and ask you what is the coolest thing that you, you've ever seen, like throughout your whole history, what's the coolest thing you've ever seen from a company that you've never worked for? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Cool. Oh man, that's a tricky question. Coolest thing I've ever seen from a company I've never worked for. Boy, I, I would love to have some genius reply here. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>No, this is a gut reply thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Yeah. If I'm just gonna be take it from the gut. I mean, we, we mentioned the drum cat, so that, that is a special place in my heart, but to me, I mean, I would just go with the simple old iPhone or iPad, you know, I mean, I think those devices have changed a lot of lives and I don't work for Apple and, but I think that that innovation has helped, you know, imagine a lot of possibilities with, you know, a touchscreen just making a touchscreen ubiquitous and feel good. I mean, there, that gets to the heart of what I was saying a minute ago about inter you know, interface design and, and Id and all that. I know that's not, that's a boring answer to say, oh Apple, but, but, you know, that is, I mean, hey, it's, I, I, I'm playing with my iPad every day and I have an iPhone that helps me with too many things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>So I, but I think like, you know, music, career music, the whole thing, I, you know, I do think that, the old <span style="color:red" data-ts="2206.345" data-end_ts="2206.565" title="2206.345" id=c_"2206.345">__Kai__</span> Samplers were really awesome to me and playing around with the, you know, which eventually, you know, a lot of the technology was in the MPC and such. So I think that stuff to me always holds a special place of like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2218.885" data-end_ts="2219.045" title="2218.885" id=c_"2218.885">__oh__</span>, that was just the coolest stuff I'd seen at that point. And if you ask me now, it's really, boy, I just think it's tricky to, there's so much stuff out there that's amazing. There 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Is indeed. Well, Dave cycling 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>74 also makes some amazing stuff. <laugh> No, really. I, I mean, and it's not just cycling doesn't make it, it's all their amazing customers. Right. So you totally get this, I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Mean, right. Well Dave, I want to thank you so much for taking the time outta your schedule. It was, you bet. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>This has been fun. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's, it's cool to just kind wander around and, and to talk, talk about, the, the ages in essence, you know, being able to kind of talk with someone else who's, who kind of went through some of those wars and, and also has a good feel for the business side of it as well. So I appreciate taking that time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Absolutely. Yeah, thanks a lot and hope I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2264.655" data-end_ts="2265.005" title="2264.655" id=c_"2264.655">__sound__</span> smart off this edit that you're gonna do. Alright, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, yeah, thanks a lot and have a great day, man. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Okay, thank you <span style="color:red" data-ts="2271.895" data-end_ts="2272.245" title="2271.895" id=c_"2271.895">__Daron__</span>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2272.245" data-end_ts="2272.525" title="2272.245" id=c_"2272.245">__Alright__</span>, bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, again, I want to thank Dave Hill for spending the time talking with us about his stuff. It's always good to hear from people that are supporting the business side of what we do when we make art. I want to thank also you, the listeners for continuing to support me listening to the podcast, downloading it, leaving comments and, and sharing it with your friends. It's all really helpful. Helps get the word out there and that's what's the important thing. I want to encourage you to continue listening. If you haven't caught up, we've got an awful lot of backlog in terms of podcasts that people might not have listened to. So go back in the archives and check 'em out. Otherwise, thanks a lot and I will catch you next week. Bye.
