<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today I have the great pleasure of getting to meet, somebody that was introduced to me by, a recent podcast guest, Bonhoeffer. She pointed to this guy and basically her words, not mine are, he's the shit, right? <laugh>. So I've always wanted to actually meet the shit and apparently I'm getting to today. So <laugh> With that, we'll talk to our guest for today, Anthony Baldino Hey, Anthony. How's it going? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony Baldino: </b>Not too bad. How are you doing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm all right. Hey, thanks so much for taking time outta your schedule to do this. I know it's you, you live a busy life, so I appreciate you taking the chance to do this. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>Of course, man. Thank you for having me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, my pleasure. So why don't we kick this off. I did a little research on you, so I think I know all the things that you're involved in. Okay. But I would prefer if you would kind of define what you do. So why don't you start kick this off by telling us what your work is? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>I guess I, whenever people ask me this, I kind of split it into quote my day job and my personal music. But I guess my personal music kind of led me to the day job part. I, I do kind of weird glitchy down tempo electronic stuff, and I used to do it kind of all field recording based until I fell down <span style="color:red" data-ts="95.485" data-end_ts="95.685" title="95.485" id=c_"95.485">__the__</span> modular, the Eurorack rabbit hole, which has just been an endless source of, finding gold and things I wouldn't ever really come up with otherwise. So I guess lately I just do a lot of, modular music and have been involved with <span style="color:red" data-ts="111.005" data-end_ts="111.125" title="111.005" id=c_"111.005">__a__</span> Los Angeles modular scene and modular on the spot. That all kind of led me to, when I first moved out to LA I wanted to do film music. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. I had this notion probably like a lot of other people, <span style="color:red" data-ts="122.725" data-end_ts="123.125" title="122.725" id=c_"122.725">__they're__</span> like, okay, I graduated school, I'm educated, and now I can just go out there and knock on someone the door and I'll have a job <laugh>. And, that got me as far as working at a liquor store, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Ooh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>Okay. Yeah. And it was one of those, like, very commercial, you must wear khakis and a collared shirt, and all the people who know me now, I only wear black. So that was good times, good times. So from there, I kind of made it my, my morning job of reading and answering any Craigslist post that said audio or mixing or sound design or film score. The first job I got from that was actually working for, a good friend of mine now Jerome Dillon, who used to be drummer <span style="color:red" data-ts="171.325" data-end_ts="171.445" title="171.325" id=c_"171.325">__in__</span> Nine Inch Dales and did a lot of studio production with him and some film work. And then that chapter kind of came to a close and I found this trailer company and I found this post that just, somebody wanted to buy some cinematic sound design, and I figured, well, I do weird electronic stuff. I can probably do that. So the only time I had, or the only thing I had to play them was this, sound design contest I did that I had ended up winning. And so I sent <span style="color:red" data-ts="198.925" data-end_ts="199.045" title="198.925" id=c_"198.925">__him__</span> this really like, heavy IDM glitchy track. And so he asked me to come in for a meeting and I played again for the owner of the company and goes, you know, you could, you could probably do trailer music, which was news to me at the time. Right. I didn't even really, it 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Was a thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>Right. Any idea. Yeah. You know, well, sure, I'll give that a shot. And it just ended up being a good fit. And, everyone at that company now is a, a really good friend of mine, so I've just been working in the trailer world ever since. Which, you know, for anyone who does electronic stuff, it's surprisingly lends itself really easy to that 'cause it's, you know, you do have to have some musical background, but it seems like even if you're doing string stuff, they still want a serious level of weirdness along with it. So Right. Lets me be weird and noisy and glitchy and take a lot of risks, which maybe I shouldn't <span style="color:red" data-ts="252.085" data-end_ts="252.245" title="252.085" id=c_"252.085">__do__</span> sometimes, because I'm sure I've lost a number of gigs because of that, but it was fun doing it anyway. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I think most people who don't already know that this is a thing, just kind of assume that the trailers use part of the movie soundtrack. But I, I would expect that in some cases the trailers have to go out long before the music sound the movie soundtrack is even nailed. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>I think it, it just depends on the film, Uhhuh <affirmative>, it depends on how they're doing the film and the approach and how much they have to record ahead of time. But yeah, I, I haven't worked on a single campaign that's, that I know of that <span style="color:red" data-ts="290.485" data-end_ts="290.685" title="290.485" id=c_"290.485">__is__</span> used original music from the score. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Really interesting. Yeah. Now, you know, if I, when I think of the music that I hear of for music trailers, I mean, first of all, you're right there, there is kind of, it does seem to lend itself to the electronic music background from one standpoint is that it's actually almost more focused on, or it brings the sound design part to the front more so than the the musical scoring part. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>Absolutely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So how difficult is it then to constantly be fresh with that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>Good question. I think one of the things that's always helped me or helped me when I first got into it, so the very first task or thing that was asked of me was to do up to 10 library queues. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And of course, like, I think two months beforehand, my hard drive with all my samples just died. So no, like, no contact libraries, no nothing. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And so I had a Zoom H four recorder and I just ended up recording tons and tons of sounds. And it's, I think that's the way that always helps me stay fresh is like, of course I'll keep all the sounds that I record, but for every single cue I do find a new sound or a new palette that is your starting point for the cue. Just so it's almost like learning to write for a new instrument. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>And, you know, recording new stuff or trying out new modules always shift the way you're going to approach writing a little bit. 'cause you'll find that idea. It's like, oh, I never would've thought that. I know I've had sounds that made me write in odd <span style="color:red" data-ts="390.965" data-end_ts="391.245" title="390.965" id=c_"390.965">__time__</span> signatures that I, I typically don't gravitate towards, but because the sound just happened to be 13 eight, that's the length of the bar that I just did a track in that. And so it also helps you keep excited about it, which can be really difficult at times, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Right, right. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, man, I have like already about 50 questions, but before I go down that rabbit hole, one of the things I like doing in my podcast is I like talking to people about, you know, how they got to be the RCR. Now, you've kind of defined what happened for you from the time you got out to LA with Stars in your eyes, and, you know, have become now this person doing this combination of your own personal music and trailer music. But what was the precursor to that? I mean, how did you grow up? How did you get to the point where you were both doing electronic stuff, but you were also, you know, interested in sound design? Where, where did those, what were your influences as you came up and what were the things you did to sort of prepare yourself to going out to LA 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>Prepared wise? Nothing. <laugh>, big mistake. <laugh> <laugh> literally moved out with a backpack and crashed on a buddy's floor for four months, which was supposed to only be two weeks. But 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, oh man, you're that, you're that roommate. <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>That guy is one of my best friends and I owe him for life. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>But getting into electronic stuff, when I was a kid growing up, I was, I was playing in bands and I played, bass guitar and really terrible punk rock bands and started getting into jazz a little bit, a very little bit. And, wanted to go to Berkeley College of Music. And so I ended up getting in, I had this idea that I was going to major in film scoring, but also be a studio bass player. And that's the life I wanted to chase more was like the more, in the studio every day playing on other people's tracks. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>And I all, I really knew of at the time I had this one Apex twin album, but, I had these two roommates and one of them was really into Radiohead and PRK <span style="color:red" data-ts="531.335" data-end_ts="531.685" title="531.335" id=c_"531.335">__Ecker__</span> and the other one was really into heavy industrial stuff. So I really <span style="color:red" data-ts="538.085" data-end_ts="538.245" title="538.085" id=c_"538.085">__had__</span> those two guys to thank for kind of schooling me on electronic music. And then one day a buddy of mine told me I had to check out Telephone Tel Aviv. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I heard the first track off Fahrenheit. Fair enough. And that was it. I just, I had to do that, or just do electronic music of some sort because I, it was just the coolest thing I'd ever heard. It's funny, it's when people ask me what I'm listening to these days, I feel like that record all their records are still in my daily rotation. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. It's funny, you know, I recently, I really recently did an interview with Josh uses, and it was Oh <span style="color:red" data-ts="575.445" data-end_ts="575.565" title="575.445" id=c_"575.445">__wow__</span>. I was actually really having trouble talking to him about his releases because to me, like, Fahrenheit fair enough is to me still a recent album, you know, for him it's something he did ages ago, but for me it's still sort of like this living music that's part of my, sort of like my daily cadence because I listen to it so much. And I think, I think there, there has been some electronic music that we've been lucky enough to experience that really does sort of like transcend the timeframe of when it was done. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>Oh yeah. I could see from his point of view everything I've done even six years ago. I mean, there's some things that I'll listen to from 10 years ago. I'm like, wow, I, how did I do that? And then other things I listen to, I'm like, oof. Yeah, I should just delete all of this <laugh>. But I, that's just, you know, you're your own worst critic at times 8,000. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So you went, so you went off to Berkeley. Right. So what moved you Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I mean, so these people kind of opened your ears up to electronics. How did you personally though, make the transition? Did you, while you were in school, did you sort of say, <span style="color:red" data-ts="651.545" data-end_ts="651.765" title="651.545" id=c_"651.545">__ah__</span>, I'm gonna focus on the film thing? Or did you try gutting it out even after you found your ears changing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>I kept the film thing because I was, I still really like it. . <affirmative>, but they, they were both in the music synthesis program at the time, and I didn't even know that was a thing. Right. To be honest. And so I dual majored and I just got in and soaked up every little bit that I could. And it's funny getting into it, I got much more into sampling and, and Maxims <span style="color:red" data-ts="685.885" data-end_ts="686.005" title="685.885" id=c_"685.885">__p__</span> and because at the time they were focusing more on soft synths and like native instruments complete with massive and all that stuff. Right. And so I always, my music would have, you know, like electronic kick drums and, other stuff, but would be heavily processed field recordings. And it wasn't really until I got my first modular sense that made me understand why they're so good and so magical and endless sources of creativity and content. Which I always thought was funny. Like, I've kind of made this full shift. I still do some field record, field recording, but, I've made this full shift in modular synthesis and that being my primary go-to for sounds and even at this point, like compositionally, I'll start there a lot. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that's, that's pretty wild. So I, I just got back from a trip out to Berkeley. They had, I think that you would really appreciate where they're, where they've kind of gone with this, what was the synthesis department is now this thing called E<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data">PD</a> which is like Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> Electronic Production Design, I think. And they actually put on the first of what looks like is <span style="color:red" data-ts="755.885" data-end_ts="756.085" title="755.885" id=c_"755.885">__gonna__</span> be an ongoing conference called Voltage Connect. And it was really Oh, I heard about that. Yeah. And it was really cool because it was very much about, you know, synthesis of all sorts. And, you know, they had Daniel Haver from Native Instruments do one of the keynotes and all that kinda stuff, but he was very focused on the modular as being a direction forward. And I thought that that was pretty unique because I'd always thought of Berkeley as being really focused on being, you know, turning you into sort of like an industry guy. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b><laugh>. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But, it, it seemed like that group of people was more focused on, I don't know, opening, opening doors or opening people's heads to be something more than that in some undefinable way. Yeah. I just found it really interesting and I, and I thought it was a neat direction for them to go if not necessarily, you know, this step-by-step way to get a job in the industry. So it's interesting now that you've gotten so deeply into, into modulars since, and I'll tell you, I saw a picture of you that made me burst out laughing because first of all, oh dear, <laugh>, it, it, no, it showed you with your kind of a portion of your modular synth <span style="color:red" data-ts="831.225" data-end_ts="831.445" title="831.225" id=c_"831.225">__set__</span> up, and it was a blackface <span style="color:red" data-ts="834.025" data-end_ts="834.245" title="834.025" id=c_"834.025">__arc__</span> 2,600, which I long had, and I, I don't anymore, but I, but I, I miss it terribly and, and a little tiptop case loaded up with some stuff, which is what I use. I use that exact same tiptop case, and I was like, yeah, okay. This is a guy I'm gonna get along with really well. <laugh> <laugh>, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>I, I can't get over those cases. I, I now have four of those, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Of those little tiptop ones. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Aren't they amazing? I think if nothing else, the the amount of design that went into making them is kind of inspirational to me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>Oh yeah. Gura is, he is a madman. He is so smart. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, and he's dedicated to doing the right thing, which is something <span style="color:red" data-ts="878.365" data-end_ts="878.485" title="878.365" id=c_"878.365">__I__</span> can always appreciate. So you have four of those, so I was just in fact, seeing then a small part of your setup. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>That was, that was a long time ago. That photo. Okay. And yeah, it just keeps on, keeps on growing and growing and growing <laugh>, which is a good problem to have, I guess, you know? Right, right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="899.455" data-end_ts="899.675" title="899.455" id=c_"899.455">__We__</span> start running outta space. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now you talk about how you moved away from sampling though, and are focusing in the modulars sort of a source of, so source of sonic development. I'm curious what that looks like. I mean, there's, there's two things I kind of want to zero in on based on where we've gotten. And they're kind of parallel, but not exactly. One of them is the concept of sound design the way that you do it, where you have, you know, different things, whether it's tensions or deep bases or whatever that you need to generate for your work work, but also this idea that you have this one track that's very like, project focused, which is making these, these trailers musical bits and then this personal development track where you're designing music that you're gonna release or you're gonna perform. And they're both kind of related, which is how do you doing this kind of design work, how do you go about it? Do you have, do you always have a goal or do you sit down in front of like this big blank slate of modules and just start playing until something captures your ear? Are you goal <span style="color:red" data-ts="975.855" data-end_ts="976.135" title="975.855" id=c_"975.855">__driven__</span> or are you inspiration driven? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>I guess it depends on the deadline. 'cause for trailer stuff, there's sometimes I'll get requests that they want <span style="color:red" data-ts="985.315" data-end_ts="985.535" title="985.315" id=c_"985.315">__it__</span>, want it the next day. Okay. Or in three days. And so for that, I still do use a lot of modular stuff. I'll always use a DPO for my kick drums to make tuned kick drums specific for that trailer. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So it's still really fat, but in tune and, you know, there's no deviation from the original sample, whether it be stretching or some sort of artifact from pitch shifting it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>Yeah. I guess from my own stuff, I approach it in two ways. Like, I'm just finishing up a track now where I was sitting down to start a different job. I've been doing some work with Dolby for similar Atmos stuff, and I'm sitting down to start a thing for them. And, the idea that I had when I was walking up to the modular was very different from what ended up coming out. And I ended up just completely abandoning the work that I had to do that day. Because, you know, you just find these things, you're like, Ooh, this is, this is way too good to not record. Right. And then you start, you're like, well, this is cool. Like, let me try patching this and patching this. And like, well, that's even cooler and you just go down this long rabbit hole of, patching stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>And for me, that's, that's also how I approach performing, which kind of lends itself to the same question of like, how do you approach writing is I'll get this giant, super busy patch going and then kind of figure out the orchestrate or the, yeah. The arrangement or kind of the choreography of being able to play it. Oh, in time. Yeah. Just kind of break it down and then figure out the shape of it. So, so half the times it goes like that. And then for other stuff, maybe I'll start with like a piano part and just kind of get the shape of a track down and then start filling in. I'll do my kicks and then I'll do all my snares. And sometimes layer the snares <span style="color:red" data-ts="1099.925" data-end_ts="1100.125" title="1099.925" id=c_"1099.925">__is__</span> like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1101.225" data-end_ts="1101.445" title="1101.225" id=c_"1101.225">__in__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1101.445" data-end_ts="1101.605" title="1101.445" id=c_"1101.445">__our__</span> 2,600 <span style="color:red" data-ts="1103.225" data-end_ts="1103.645" title="1103.225" id=c_"1103.225">__really__</span> snare plus, finger snaps or magnolia leaves, like just dry leaves crunching and just kind of go layer by layer and do more, focused and finite production, if that makes any sense. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Well, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1121.865" data-end_ts="1122.085" title="1121.865" id=c_"1121.865">__the__</span>, what I, what I always struggle with for myself, and maybe you have some clues on this, when I'm working on something that has a deadline or has a purpose, somehow I'm able to basically say, okay, it's done. Right. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, it's either done because the clock tells me it's done <laugh> or it's done because somehow, you know, I've used up whatever space I've been given or I've been, or I fulfilled something that makes me, gives me the sense that I'm done. Right. Right. When I perform, I often start with, I don't come pre-packed. Right. Instead, I sort of like, make things up on the fly, which is really hard. Wow. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1169.015" data-end_ts="1169.365" title="1169.015" id=c_"1169.015">__Great__</span> man. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh yeah. Well, you know, it comes from having a system. I have just one of those tiptop cases and it's been relatively the same for several years now. And so I really know it well and I can kind of conjure things up and I, you know, I have ideas in my head and also the way that the day goes will sort of inform me of what I'm gonna end up with for a patch. Right, right. But, when I'm actually, when I'm trying to do, like, music for a quote release or a music for, you know, that's, that is meant to be some sort of artistic statement. I am stymied, I'm stymied because I never, first of all, I never know when done is done. Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b><affirmative> <laugh> the perpetual problem. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And then the second thing is, in every case, I can convince myself the next day that what I did was shit. Right. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. And so I'm gonna ask you, because you actually, you know, both from your day job and your own, your own work, you have had to bridge these problems. What, what are the tricks that you play on yourself to allow you to call things done, call things good, call things suitable for release? What are the ways that you allow yourself to do that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>Oh, man. Lately I've been doing this, just kind of tricking myself. I got asked a demo for this one trailer for Wonder Woman, and I only had three days to do it. And, you know, I did it as fast as I could. And at the end of the three days, I, on the fourth day, I poured myself a cup of coffee and was like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1275.335" data-end_ts="1275.455" title="1275.335" id=c_"1275.335">__ah__</span>, let me go in the studio and listen to how bad that turned out. <laugh> <laugh>, as we all do. And I, I sat there like, you know, this is actually really good, not tooting my own horn. And I rarely say that, but I'm saying that because like, I only had three days to crank something out and I could have done garbage, but I managed to do something that I think's really good. Why can't I do that with my own music? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>Why do I always feel like it needs to take a month and a half plus x amount of suffering, to call a track done? So lately I've just kind of been trying to approach it as if, a client called and said, you have a week to do this. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So just tricking myself into the, okay, I have to sit down and I just have to do something and just start writing and let, let that guide me rather than like, stick to the idea. Like, I walked in with this idea today and I have to make sure that this idea gets executed. Because I feel like a lot of times, as, as any sort of artist, if you try and fulfill or like make that idea a reality, it's not gonna be as good as it was in your head. So letting yourself astray a little bit, if not all the way, it is really beneficial. 'cause then you'll do something that a, you didn't think you had in you. And b, you'll actually finish something <laugh>. Right. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That actually finishing thing is such a beat down sometimes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>Oh, yeah. And it's, I've been having a conversation with a buddy of mine who does more pop oriented stuff and he's trying to finish up his first release, and we kind of talk about what if people don't like the single? And sometimes I, I think about it, I'm not really in the pop world, but I always wonder like, well, is it you who actually gets to decide what's good or is it someone else? It's like going back to the Josh <span style="color:red" data-ts="1396.625" data-end_ts="1396.915" title="1396.625" id=c_"1396.625">__uses__</span> thing, like I think all of their work is solid gold and hearing him rag on himself. So I was like, wait, what? No, <laugh> <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I know. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>So yeah, I, that's what I'm struggling with too now is like I'm getting a lot of modular tracks together to release and trying to let myself just let it go and let people decide what's good and what's not, or what is the best of my work, or the worst of my work. I don't know. Sure. Maybe it's all terrible <laugh>. I think it also doing this comes with a certain amount of letting yourself off the hook. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, I'll tell you, I, I've known people who have been just fearless about just, you know, pooping stuff out and feeling okay about the fact that it went out into the world. And I don't know, I, I envy them. And at the same time, I just can't even imagine what it takes to do that, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>Oh, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So I have, another question because it's, again, all this stuff is kind of related just because it's popping up in my head as we're talking. One of the things that is, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1462.995" data-end_ts="1463.285" title="1462.995" id=c_"1462.995">__well__</span>, we talk about trailer music, but if we also talk about modular music, what we tend to think of is things that have extremes, right? There's extreme frequency ranges that work kind of extreme dynamics, extreme, extreme sound design. And a lot of times, surprises built into the narrative of the tracks, right? Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b><affirmative>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>One of the things that I, that I wonder is, do you, do you generally work at home or do you work in a studio? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>I have, a studio at home, so Okay. Work at home. Yes. <laugh>. Alright. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What kind of monitoring system do you use that's in any way useful for doing this combination of work? Because to me, when I go to a theater and I hear their big surround trailer tracks, it, it's pretty overwhelming and it's hard for me to imagine any kind of a home studio situation that actually can give you reasonable monitoring feedback on that stuff. What <span style="color:red" data-ts="1532.605" data-end_ts="1532.725" title="1532.605" id=c_"1532.605">__does__</span>, what does your monitor setup look like? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>Right now I have a TC 20 fives, and those are paired with two subwoofer pros. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>So, and when I first got 'em, I knew I wanted the ATCs, but, a few friends of mine started telling me I should look into doing a dual sub <span style="color:red" data-ts="1557.705" data-end_ts="1557.925" title="1557.705" id=c_"1557.705">__set__</span> up. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b><affirmative> and I, yeah. I think a lot of us are, you know, schooled to say, to believe like you only need one sub or one sub is the appropriate thing. But, I think for film, like, like you're saying in theaters, there's a lot more going on than just one subwoofer. So, I think the dual sub thing helps a lot. 'cause I do, I'll tend to do weird things for trailers, like out of tune sign waves, like sub <span style="color:red" data-ts="1589.075" data-end_ts="1589.365" title="1589.075" id=c_"1589.075">__sign__</span> waves, but <span style="color:red" data-ts="1589.925" data-end_ts="1590.125" title="1589.925" id=c_"1589.925">__pants__</span> left and right. So you get this weird, like physical, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Like pulsing almost, right. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>Yeah. Yeah. It just, it's kind of odd. And, so I also imported, the Dark Knight scores and just put those into Pro tools and watched it with, an EQ on it with the analyzer on. And it was really surprising to me to see the amount of stereo sub that they had in it. Interesting. Yeah. So I figured there had to be something to it. So that's, so yeah, that's what I'm, I'm using to monitor and the ATCs are, the response is super linear. So like if you listen really quiet, you get the same frequent <span style="color:red" data-ts="1638.285" data-end_ts="1638.505" title="1638.285" id=c_"1638.285">__see__</span> response you do, and it's really loud. So, you know, that helps me and at least the confidence department of knowing that it's gonna translate. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well it's funny because this, this, dual sub thing keeps on coming up. I, my friend Ron a long time ago was like, you know, it's really something you have to consider. And I was like, well, I think it sounds ridiculous because that's not the way <laugh> sound is supposed to work. Right, right. But it definitely, it, it seems to, if nothing else, it certainly, cleans up anomalies that you might have in your room. You know, it seems that's, it seems to help that a bunch. But now, so you said you have the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1683.865" data-end_ts="1683.985" title="1683.865" id=c_"1683.865">__a__</span> TC 20 fives, those are like some mm-Hmm. <affirmative> jaw droppingly expensive monitors. Is it for you, is that just like, Hey, this is, this is what <span style="color:red" data-ts="1692.705" data-end_ts="1692.865" title="1692.705" id=c_"1692.705">__it__</span>, this is one of the tools of the trade and I just have to buy into it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>Yes. No. <laugh> I've been up until, up until last year I was mixing on Yamaha Hs eighties. Yeah. Okay. And, and I still love those speakers, I think for that price range, you know, really, really good speakers. But I just felt I, I pushed them as far as I could and no matter what, I'd always hear something wrong. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>When I took them to a buddy's house or if it played in the theater or, so I just wanted to get to a point where if there was something wrong, it was because I was doing it wrong and not 'cause I couldn't hear it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Got it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>So I saved obviously for a little bit and pulled the trigger on the ATCs. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Pretty happy with them <span style="color:red" data-ts="1745.125" data-end_ts="1745.345" title="1745.125" id=c_"1745.125">__up__</span> that, huh? Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>Oh yeah. It's, I mean, getting, getting used to them was, and still is a bit of a challenge. And that is one thing I, as soon as I got 'em, I was like, you know, if I could give 20-year-old me advice, it'd be to invest in better speakers way earlier. 'cause your ear just gets so used to how a different speaker works. And then when you buy in later, you know, we're all really busy. So like, you don't want to be taking time away from the creative <span style="color:red" data-ts="1775.255" data-end_ts="1775.545" title="1775.255" id=c_"1775.255">__part__</span>, part of your day to make sure you're doing things correctly on a new set of speakers, but Right. Yeah. I mean, the clarity in them is just unbelievable. And I, I can't tell you how many records I put up just to listen to in the morning <span style="color:red" data-ts="1790.825" data-end_ts="1791.045" title="1790.825" id=c_"1790.825">__and__</span> like, oh wow. I never, never heard that synth part or never heard that little sound design floating. And it'd be like a record I've listened to for 12 years. Right. So, yeah. I really love them. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I'm gonna have to start saving up my box tops for something like that <laugh>, because that sounds like a, that sounds like a winning, winning turn. So now <span style="color:red" data-ts="1810.665" data-end_ts="1810.885" title="1810.665" id=c_"1810.665">__you__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1810.905" data-end_ts="1811.125" title="1810.905" id=c_"1810.905">__it__</span> <laugh>. Oh, thank you Satan. You can get off my shoulder now, <laugh>. So, one of the things you said is you've moved kind of from sampling into the, into really being focused on using the modular stuff. Do you still find yourself doing like a lot of sampling of the modular in order to make it convenient to work with in terms of arrangement? Or are you pretty, or are you still pretty oriented towards going from the mod modular and spilling it directly to a mix? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>I, I lean towards staying modular. You know, sometimes if time allows, I'll write with like just some soft <span style="color:red" data-ts="1853.295" data-end_ts="1853.645" title="1853.295" id=c_"1853.295">__sense__</span> and then use a MIDI to CD converter. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="1858.085" data-end_ts="1858.285" title="1858.085" id=c_"1858.085">__so__</span>, and just, you know, if I'm writing the base part, I'll just use a sine wave just to get the part down so my ear isn't attached to a specific sound later. And then take the MIDI out, convert it to cd, and then just start tweaking on the modular and find something cool and record that in. I have for, for trailer work, I have a folder of different bass sounds that I can just put in the contact real quick or patches that I've saved that I know will work. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. 'cause sometimes you just have, you just don't have the time, like do all the fun parts. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and there's, there are some like really iconic sounds that are used in trailers that aren't really even used anywhere else in the real world. Right. There's that like, big Yeah. Sub, impact sound and they're like the big huge drops and the huge rises and stuff that are sort of particular to that kind of work. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1911.275" data-end_ts="1911.565" title="1911.275" id=c_"1911.275">__Yeah__</span>. And so I would imagine that, you know, a certain amount of your arsenal is just things that you've developed over time that aren't in your tool belt. And you know, sometimes you need a screwdriver, so you have to pull out the screwdriver. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>This is true. This is true. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So in terms of your DAW and stuff, what, what do you tend towards for doing this work and or, or is there stuff that you're kind of required to use? Are you, are you compelled to like, provide pro tool sessions or anything like that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>All the people I work with just require stems, like a full mix <span style="color:red" data-ts="1943.365" data-end_ts="1943.565" title="1943.365" id=c_"1943.365">__in__</span> stems Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So DOD doesn't really matter. I always used Logic up until actually this month I just started trying to make the shift to Pro Tools. Oh wow. Yeah. Another learning curve in my life. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> <laugh>. Why would you use Pro Tools on the creative end? Does it drive you in a specific direction or is it like, I sometimes I sometimes play around with changing stuff up just to make it so that I, my reliable crutches are no longer there. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>Yeah. I think for sound design stuff, it, for me it's been a lot faster. Granted, I haven't given Logic XA chance yet, and I heard they just did, their version of Audio Suite. But having Audio Suite has been phenomenal. And the other thing too that, that I'm really loving about Pro Tools is one of the most simple parts of mixing and it's just the panning in it is actual true panning. And in logic it's, if you're panning something right, it's just turning the volume on the left channel down so you're not moving the information that's in the left speaker to the right, which has always been really frustrating. 'cause I mean, obviously it's not accurate, but having to put on a plugin <span style="color:red" data-ts="2013.965" data-end_ts="2014.125" title="2013.965" id=c_"2013.965">__to__</span> swap a stereo image just to get something, you know, the one or two extra steps to do a workaround, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2021.605" data-end_ts="2021.885" title="2021.605" id=c_"2021.605">__that__</span> seems like a no brainer that should be there before you start implementing other things into your software. So mostly for cleaner mixing is, is the reason why I was drawn to it. 'cause <span style="color:red" data-ts="2032.205" data-end_ts="2032.325" title="2032.205" id=c_"2032.205">__all__</span> of my friends who use it, just the spatialization and the, the headroom that they have just always seems, it just sounds so good. And I'm always like, why, why is it that I can't do that? So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's interesting that you say that because I, I certainly do notice the difference different sounds in mixes from different daws. Right? Yeah. I mean, conceivably, once you mix to a stereo track set or a mix of stems or whatever, you shouldn't really be able to notice it if, you know, whatever, whatever decisions you made should transcend the software. Right. But that's not true. And I'd never really spent the time analyzing like the panning functions. But certainly there is something about pro tools mixing that seems to be clean, seems to, seems to be cleaner. I always assume that it was just, when I work in logic, I, I feel like I'm pushed into using more plugins than I normally would. Right. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, there's something about that environment that draws me into like throwing yet another thing on yet another log on the fire. Right. <laugh> and, you know, where where definitely that doesn't feel like the case in Pro Tools and so I just as <span style="color:red" data-ts="2107.365" data-end_ts="2107.485" title="2107.365" id=c_"2107.365">__soon__</span> as that, but I never really, I never really thought to examine the, the raw pure tools of like, basic planning and level management. That's interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>Yeah. It just seems cleaner and like the things that I always wanted to hear I can now achieve. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So that's pretty cool. So you're just, you're just starting on that then, huh? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>Yeah, just, just dove in this month. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Wow. Well, good luck. I'm, I'll check in with you next time I'm out in la I'm gonna stop by and just check in with you, find out how's that's going because 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>Yeah, please do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That seems like a very interesting, very interesting thing to do. Do you, do you end up using MIDI very much then? You mentioned sometimes, you know, very quickly using it for sketching out ideas, but your interaction between like pro tools and your modular system, are you piping MIDI back and forth or are you doing live stuff and just sort of capturing, capturing it on Pro tools, sort of like an extended tape deck paradigm? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>For the most part, it's functioning as a tape machine for personal work. But for trailer stuff I definitely use a lot of midi. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>Because you need the, the 11 million layers of drum tracks and <laugh>, you know, string samples and choir samples and 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>All the samples. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>How much time do you have to spend just like tracking down this week's new stack of sample libraries? I, I ended up, for some reason I got, I think it was Producer Loops maybe. I bought, I think I was looking for like hand <span style="color:red" data-ts="2202.885" data-end_ts="2203.125" title="2202.885" id=c_"2202.885">__drum__</span> samples and I bought some like $4 pack of samples off of them. And now I'm on their mailing list, which every week informs me of like the 50 new sample libraries that have come out in the subsequent week. Oh man. Right. It's shocking. There's just like an amazing assortment of stuff coming out every single week. How much, how much do you feel like it's your job to stay on top of what's coming out? What's current in the sample world? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>If I am supposed to be doing that <laugh>, I'm doing a terrible job doing that <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh no. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>But I think it, it kind of comes back to what we were talking about earlier on how do you keep the idea fresh, right? <span style="color:red" data-ts="2244.045" data-end_ts="2244.285" title="2244.045" id=c_"2244.045">__It's__</span> like I kind of have my go-to orchestral things that I know work. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, especially for the way that I write, but I don't have a single, that's not true. I think I did one purely orchestral track, but most of my stuff just 'cause of the way I write is always really <span style="color:red" data-ts="2264.255" data-end_ts="2264.605" title="2264.255" id=c_"2264.255">__sense__</span> or sound design heavy. So I think a lot of the new, instead of using, something that I sampled from the modular last year, coming up with something new, kind of replaces for me having to have a new sample bank. . And if it is electronic drums or stuff, I'm, I've always been from the school of making 'em myself. I kind <span style="color:red" data-ts="2287.965" data-end_ts="2288.045" title="2287.965" id=c_"2287.965">__of__</span> always, it's funny when I first heard that, the first telephone Tel Aviv record, you know, knowing that they made all their own stuff or made some of it, I don't know actually how much they made, but I just assumed that everybody made their own kick drums in their own snares. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>So I just got into this practice of 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That was part of the work. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>Yeah. Yeah. So I know a lot of people and a few people that I work with on trailers, they, whenever they see me go over to the modular and flip it on, it says, no, I don't, I don't want to go down that rabbit hole. And they'd rather just snag a sample or something really fast. But for me it, it takes me longer to sift through samples and find <span style="color:red" data-ts="2328.265" data-end_ts="2328.485" title="2328.265" id=c_"2328.265">__the__</span> sample Right. Than just make something. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. The, the complexity of going through huge, huge lists of sounds is, is it, it's kind of a creativity killer I think too. You know, you end up just, yeah. Because inevitably you're just like, I'm effing done looking at this list of crap and I'm just gonna grab this thing 'cause it's close enough. But once you do that, then all of a sudden you also find out that now it's actually more problematic to tweak it to be what you wanted and you just end up giving up. And that giving up process that is sort of a creativity killer for sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>Oh, absolutely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So do you think that, that the modular is kind of the ultimate in the creativity line for you? Or do you think that you might end up going back and exploring sampling again? Or do you think that there's something else that you might get into? Or does it, or does modular feel like the terminal point of, of what your, I don't <span style="color:red" data-ts="2389.805" data-end_ts="2389.845" title="2389.805" id=c_"2389.805">__know__</span> what to say what your instrument's going to be. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>I think the modular will always kind of be my instrument, not my primary instrument. But I, it's, it's interesting it's because I, I still sample stuff and we'll put it in the modular. There's modules that, you know, you can just put a bunch of one shots in and run through your drum sounds or, or put a two minute whatever you want. A two minute drone, two minute field recording. So I'll definitely still be sampling stuff 'cause it is really fun. It's just, I, I guess it's also ease of use where as I can just turn around and walk over to my modular rig versus like getting out of Los Angeles <laugh> and finding somewhere quiet enough to go record. You know, I think that's kind of one thing that's held me back is just where I live. Yeah. I mean, sure there's lots of stuff to be recorded, but I've always found it challenging trying to find that thing to record. So. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. You know, the other thing I think is, and who knows, maybe there's gonna be a future where somebody's going to make a sampler that has 200 knobs on it. Because there's something about the immediacy. The immediacy of having a modular and patching the things you want, but then you tweak it not by adjusting numbers, but by grabbing a knob and turning it until it not only sounds right, but like feels right. Yeah. And the lack of any sampler that can do that is kind of the thing that I think is a beat <span style="color:red" data-ts="2483.245" data-end_ts="2483.485" title="2483.245" id=c_"2483.245">__down__</span> in working with samples. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>I think especially once you've kind of caught the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2488.485" data-end_ts="2489.045" title="2488.485" id=c_"2488.485">__eurorack__</span> bug or the modular bug, it's just so pleasing and so instant gratification where, you know, I've had a, a number of times where I've been messing with samples and turns into something really cool, but then there's the other times where it's just hours of tweaking before you come to the realization that this just isn't working right. And I need to press delete and start over <laugh>. Yeah. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, right. So now one of the things I'm curious about because I, I got a chance to listen to some of your work on SoundCloud and I'm gonna strongly recommend for the listeners to do the same because it's really beautiful work. Thank you. But how do you translate that into live environment? So like, I know you've done the modular on the spot thing, . <affirmative> with Eric and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2536.165" data-end_ts="2536.365" title="2536.165" id=c_"2536.165">__Ana__</span> and, and that crew. How do you take something that's as layer driven and cinematic as the, as your recorded work and translate that to a live environment, especially one where maybe a computer's not even invited to the party? 
</p>

<b>Anthony: </b>I think it's just nature of the beast having limited tools. It's gonna be a little bit different and I'll choose to do different things, but a lot of the glitchy stuff I still incorporate in my live, live performances. And I think some of the kind of softer like reverb drenched piano type things, I'll, I'll put into, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2576.975" data-end_ts="2577.325" title="2576.975" id=c_"2576.975">__cubit__</span>, qubit nebula and play that through, you know, like, my <span style="color:red" data-ts="2582.885" data-end_ts="2583.205" title="2582.885" id=c_"2582.885">__Ryman__</span> pedal or through clouds and just make, kind of recycle that or use it to regenerate new parts. Almost like remixing Sure. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2595.205" data-end_ts="2595.325" title="2595.205" id=c_"2595.205">__A__</span> five remixing, which is always fun 'cause it gives an extended life to your older work. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Do you ever use looper pedals or do you ever do looping as part of part of that work? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>I don't, I've tried really hard to get into pedals, but I don't know, have a hard time with it, so Right. Basically just stick to my <span style="color:red" data-ts="2615.245" data-end_ts="2615.365" title="2615.245" id=c_"2615.245">__striving__</span> and that's it at this point. Interesting. I mean, I'd love to, I'd love to try other pedals. I guess that's something I should due diligence on, is just going to big city music and trying out every pedal. 'cause I get frustrated quickly sometimes and it'll just be like, this one pedal is stupid <laugh>. So all pedals are stupid. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alls are stupid <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>Don't quote me on that. <laugh>. I think, I think the, the big thing that gets me really at the end of the day is like, I love the modular stuff 'cause it's all in one enclosure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>So to have a bunch of other kind of scattered things, I'm really making this sound bad for myself. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2658.485" data-end_ts="2658.845" title="2658.485" id=c_"2658.485">__RNA__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>No love pedals. No, quite frankly, I, I, I actually, I completely agree. 'cause one of the things that I found in putting together my system is there's certain things I did not want outside of the box. I, I wanted it so that I could flip open and maybe it's the allure of that tip <span style="color:red" data-ts="2675.825" data-end_ts="2676.045" title="2675.825" id=c_"2675.825">__top__</span> case, right. Which you flip it open and it feels like a thing. It feels like I just opened my lunchbox. Right. And I'm getting ready to, to get on it. Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2684.965" data-end_ts="2685.165" title="2684.965" id=c_"2684.965">__Yeah__</span>. And I don't wanna say, okay, I'm gonna flip that open and I have these three electron boxes I have to set up and I have to wire everything across and oh yeah, I've got my, chaos pad and I've got my, blue sky pedal and next thing I know I'm mentally saying, you know, a laptop with some plugins would be a whole lot easier. Right. Yeah. There's something about flipping open that case and just saying, it's all right here and I, I can just live inside this little world. I kind of really like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>Oh, totally. The other thing too for me is once you get a reverb module or something like, a delay like the echo <span style="color:red" data-ts="2722.805" data-end_ts="2723.005" title="2722.805" id=c_"2722.805">__phone__</span>, you get so spoiled being able to have CV control over everything. So like, you can be focusing on your drum pattern while you have a bunch of LFOs, like a extra set of hands tweaking your delay module. Right. And then just having like that versus a delay pedal or a rever pedal, which still sounds really good, but it no longer feels like a part of the piece. To me it's, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I certainly, I certainly feel that way about delays. I mean, because if nothing else, like CV modulating the delay time, there's so much stuff you get to do when you allow yourself to do that. But you're never gonna do it with a pedal. It's just never gonna work because if nothing else Yeah. You can't get tweaky enough with it. Right. And so, yeah, absolutely. Yeah, I, I completely agree. Well, cool. It's, it makes a lot of sense and I can, you know, I have a sense for how you, how you work, which is kind of interesting because again, listening to your work, I was like, man, you go places that I don't even know, I don't really understand completely. Right. So it's interesting to kinda hear where your, where your head is at and how you sort <span style="color:red" data-ts="2796.725" data-end_ts="2796.845" title="2796.725" id=c_"2796.725">__of__</span> develop these things. It's really cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>Thank you. I appreciate that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So with that, I've more than used up my time already. I really appreciate you taking time outta your schedule to do this. One last question before, before we go, of course. Let's assume that someone's listening to this podcast, they're, working in a liquor store with their khakis on and they're wondering how they're gonna, kick off their sound design career. What are some of the things that you would say you would suggest that they focus on or, or put some effort behind? You know, what are the things that that can really help people not necessarily get a job as much as put together their personal voice? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>Good question. I don't know that I have a good answer, but I don't know. I think staying away from samples has always helped me. Just trying to create everything from scratch always seems like a good way. If you want to have sound design, heavy music seems like a good way, almost a natural way of finding your own voice. 'cause that way you're gonna gravitate towards the sounds that you like and that naturally, affect and inspire the music you're gonna write. So sure. You know, whether it's getting like a little zoom recorder or starting a modular rig or if you prefer, you know, another tool that I think a lot of people forget about is reactor, which I think is amazing. Like, whenever I visit my folks, I always have my laptop and I'm just trying to build and learn, more about reactor because it, I mean it's, it's like having a modular system just on your laptop, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>So yeah, I think learning to build things and learning how things work because that also, that's made me significantly faster when it comes to doing trailer music <span style="color:red" data-ts="2905.045" data-end_ts="2905.405" title="2905.045" id=c_"2905.045">__because__</span>, you know, this needs to be really sound <span style="color:red" data-ts="2907.245" data-end_ts="2907.525" title="2907.245" id=c_"2907.245">__design__</span> heavy and really weird. <laugh>, I've already made plenty of weird stuff, most of it unusable, but at least I know you almost teach yourself what to reach for first. Opposed to like, I need to make this exact sound, or I've made this exact sound. It's almost like knowing which tool to reach for or which direction to start walking down that will lead you to the end goal. I don't know if any of that's helpful, but 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>No, I think it is because one of the things it does is it points to something that no one talks about, which is so often plugins or music software or whatever is just <span style="color:red" data-ts="2945.735" data-end_ts="2946.085" title="2945.735" id=c_"2945.735">__chuck__</span> full of presets. And the thing is, yeah, stepping through the presets doesn't teach you anything. It gives you a way to get some music onto, onto a track, but it doesn't <span style="color:red" data-ts="2956.745" data-end_ts="2956.965" title="2956.745" id=c_"2956.745">__nec__</span> you aren't learning anything in the process. And I think what you're talking about is that sort of like the quest to understand is probably more important than the gear you have or the education you have or whatever, that, that quest and, and having the hunger to learn that stuff is what really ends up helping you find your own space. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>I agree completely. And I definitely agree with <span style="color:red" data-ts="2980.765" data-end_ts="2980.925" title="2980.765" id=c_"2980.765">__the__</span>, like it really doesn't matter what gear you have. You can always do something cool with just a single tool or a few tools. I always hate hearing people say like, well I need to get this thing and this other thing before I can, that'll 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Be get started right then I can get started. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>Right. Yeah. It's like, if, if that's what you really, really need, then by all means do it. But there's always something to be done, you know, even if you just focus on doing something ultra ambient that day, it doesn't have to be your grand opus, but just start making music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Anthony, I want to thank you so much for your time. This has been a, has has been really fun to talk, and to get your insights on things, get some of your vision for how, how this stuff happens. It was really awesome to talk to you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>Yeah, same here. I really appreciate this man. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, no, no worries. And next time I'm out there, we're gonna hang out. All right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>Yeah, you are welcome. Anytime the door's always open. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sounds great. Thank you so much. And we'll talk again soon. Bye now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>Sounds like a plan. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thanks for Anthony for, the great chat. It was really interesting to hear of how he approaches both his personal music as well as his work creating movie trailers. Really interesting stuff and it's really fun to hear from a guy who, when he first thinks of a sound, the first thing he does is turn to a modular. Thanks so much for listening. I appreciate it. I appreciate each one of you tuning in to these, weekly podcasts. And with that, I'm gonna sign off for this week. Catch you next time <span style="color:red" data-ts="3081.525" data-end_ts="3081.805" title="3081.525" id=c_"3081.525">__around__</span>. Bye.
