<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today I have, a real pleasure. I'm going to get to do one of my few multi-person interviews. I'm talking to, a group called <inaudible>, which they coached me very well on trying to figure it out. I, it seemed like we all came together to figure out how to pronounce it. And the two people I'm talking to is Ben Forst and Christine, <span style="color:red" data-ts="42.305" data-end_ts="42.725" title="42.305" id=c_"42.305">__papaya__</span>. Very interesting group. And instead of even trying to stumble through an explanation, I'm gonna have them describe themselves. So with that, I turn it over, to <inaudible>. Ben, Christine. Hey, good morning. How are you guys doing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin Forest: </b>Good morning. Great. Great. Yeah, good morning. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So let's start off by having you describe yourself, because your written descriptions are quite elegant and quite, like confusing to me, <laugh>. So I would like, I would like a bit of an explanation, please. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>Yeah. Yeah. So we have, you know, a couple different one-liners that, you know, that progressively, you know, kind of go deeper into kinda what ate is. We call it a, an audio visual digital sacred music duo. So that's just kind of broadly from the music standpoint. It's a little bit easier, you know, to, to narrow down. Like, although it's not super accurate, I would guess I would say it's, it sounds like 16th century choral music with like noise and industrial, <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christine Papania: </b><laugh> electronics. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So like, that's the music portion. But then there's also this, visual portion, you know, there's <span style="color:red" data-ts="111.735" data-end_ts="111.855" title="111.735" id=c_"111.735">__a__</span> live generat generative visuals that, you know, happen in real time with the, with the performance. And then there's, we do audio visual albums, and so that's sort of the, the visual side of things and how they come together. It's always interesting, but they do. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not sure if I totally describe that super well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I would say that there's a jumble of words there. <laugh>. I'm not sure <laugh>. So I'll, I'll tell you what throws me, because it's almost like I hit this word and it's like a speed bump for me. And I, I am struggle from there. On. You describe your work as sacred work and, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="153.395" data-end_ts="153.615" title="153.395" id=c_"153.395">__how__</span> you've been nice enough to share some, some examples with me, which are, are amazing. And you're right, this kind of like, it, it really seems to echo ancient music, right? Yeah. It's, it's amazing. But at the same time, what about it makes you describe it as sacred? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christine: </b>I would say from a music standpoint, I mean, and once we get into our backgrounds, I think you'll have a bit more understanding about that. But we both grew up singing in children's choir. I am a professional choral singer in New York. And, most of my choral singing comes within the church with liturgical music and sacred music in that aspect. I think also art-wise, we're really drawn to that period of time, and I think that just comes out in our work, both musically and art. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>Yeah. When we started, well, when we started this project, we didn't have a, a super specific goal, and it turned into a very specific goal. Christine was just kind of immersed in, in all of <span style="color:red" data-ts="219.965" data-end_ts="220.085" title="219.965" id=c_"219.965">__this__</span> sacred music. We didn't know that it would, but it heavily seeped into what we were doing, and yeah. Then we kind of took it from there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, it's interesting too because a lot of times when artists take on sort of like religious, whether it's iconography or soundscapes or whatever, they do so in a very, in a very critical or critique driven way. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I would say that the work that you do almost tends more to be an homage to, sacred works rather than some sort of a, a critique of them. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christine: </b>Totally. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I may have missed. Okay. Well, good. I was hoping I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>Hadn't 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Missed the mark, but it seemed like what you're doing is you're taking sort of the incredible emotions that are attached to those sounds Yes. And using that as kind of like the, the launch point for the rest of your work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christine: </b>Totally, totally. I think we never ever wanna be literal uhhuh <affirmative> in anything that we do. So I do feel like we take bits and pieces of the things that influence us. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Take me then through the process of saying, you know, we have this at the heart of our work, but I'm also gonna like, take the bucket of glitch and pour some of that in, and I'm gonna pour in some noise and I'm gonna pour in some WebGL <laugh>. How does that all come together <span style="color:red" data-ts="316.765" data-end_ts="316.985" title="316.765" id=c_"316.765">__in__</span>, in what you've got, pulling this, pulling this off 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christine: </b><laugh>? Yeah, totally. I think just speaking musically, Ben and I met in college and we were both in the conservatory at Indiana University and the music school. So we were within this really strict classical setting. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But that's kind of when we started making music together. And so we were then always drawn to the underground experimental scene in Bloomington, Indiana. So I think from the very beginning we were tapping into parts that weren't strictly classical, just from the musical standpoint. And then, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>Yeah. Yeah. Well, I think a lot of the aspects of like, you know, some of the, especially, you know, the harsher and and darker aspects of both the visuals and the music, a lot of sacred music tends to be either or pretty or kind of, you know, just evoking this, you know, sort of beautiful image of the, of the divine. But I feel like there's a lot more than just that. I think, you know, we enjoy discovering ways to talk about that with those like, you know, darker textures and, both, you know, sonically and visually. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It does, it does seem like spirituality always does have this mix of like a fascination with the dark too. Yeah. You know, it's almost like, it's almost like as wonderful as God is, Satan's <span style="color:red" data-ts="403.965" data-end_ts="404.125" title="403.965" id=c_"403.965">__kind__</span> of interesting, you know? Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christine: </b><laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>Well, and Satan can be interesting, but God can be, be God can be scary too. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Can be scary. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>Terrifying too, you know? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="412.805" data-end_ts="412.925" title="412.805" id=c_"412.805">__Yeah__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Good point. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christine: </b>I don't know if you wanted to talk about kind of how the WebGL and all of the visual components sort of integrated into who Ariadne is. 'cause it didn't always start out that way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>No. It basically started from wanting more control of how our, our music was presented. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, when we first started, we wanted like, total control of the, of the entire, you know, not just the sound, but you know, what you were looking at. Even if it was just what, what we were probably thinking at that time, you know, just a static image, what is, visuals representing, you know, us as a, our art. And neither of us were visual artists and we didn't know anyone who could, you know, help us kind of achieve that. So I kind of started figuring stuff out. Interesting. And that's <laugh> and that's, and that's how it, it's just kind of been that, that sort of process. Yeah. That progression of, figuring stuff out so that we can have control. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it seems though, to make some sense, <span style="color:red" data-ts="477.835" data-end_ts="478.125" title="477.835" id=c_"477.835">__Jeff__</span>, if for no other reason, then again, the, the music you're doing kind of steps outside the bounds of what, you know, what would be typical. And so having kind of resting control of the environment that you experience, it makes sense. Now you guys perform live, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>Yes. Yes. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I would assume, especially in that kind of circumstance, it's really valuable to say whatever, whatever the room is that I'm playing with, I'm gonna transform it into a place that I can, I can control. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christine: </b>Totally. And I think our music is so immersive that we just wanted an entire immersive experience. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And with the visuals in a live setting, it really helps us achieve that. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And maybe at one point the visuals when we were first creating them had been secondary, but now they're totally equal with the music. We couldn't imagine it any other way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>No. Yeah. And that, that happened pretty quickly. I mean, it went from visuals being a, a, a thing I was figuring out for, you know, a couple months to, alright, this is a, a complete package and the visuals are equally as important. Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative>, what did you do, sort of like, from a self-training standpoint to make yourself feel? I, I guess what I would, what I think, and I, I've actually gotten drawn into doing visuals a lot too. And one of the things I felt like was, there was a period where I had to become comfortable saying to myself that I was a visual artist. Right. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>Totally. Oh my gosh. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christine: </b>I feel like Ben sometimes still struggles with that actually, which is crazy with all the stuff he's done. But it's weird when you haven't had the proper training. Right. Sometimes it's hard to say you're a visual artist. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>Yeah. Well, especially like, and this is true for both of us growing up, like, music was the thing that I did like, that was, that was my life. And art was something, visual art at least, was something I gave little thought to. Hated art class <laugh>, hated any, basically anything that didn't involve music. Even like right now we're just finishing, well, not just finishing, but we are, in the crunch of, of finishing, you know, this audiovisual album. So, you know, I'm just working on, on visuals every day. And it's still like, it still seems unnatural to you even having a, I mean, spent, you know, 15 hours coding, you know, WebGL visuals to, to say that. Yes. I'm a, a visual artist, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and there's, I mean, you know, there's always the struggle with like the imposter syndrome too. You feel like, you know, you're always worrying Well, and what I'm doing is that too simplistic or too primitive? Yeah. And one of the things I found out is that I, I had a really great experience working with dancers at one point. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, which was like, they wanted, you know, some demos. So I, what I'd do is I'd put together like 20 different things and then we'd go through 'em all. And so I did some things that I liked, but seemed too simple. And then I'd work really hard on these really complex things, and I'd get in front of 'em and I'd do 'em all. And it'd be like, well, those complex ones were really cool, but that simple one, when we actually used it in, in the context of the total artwork, it, it just <span style="color:red" data-ts="673.805" data-end_ts="673.965" title="673.805" id=c_"673.805">__worked__</span> so fabulously. And I was like, oh geez, okay. So maybe I have to, I have to just shut down the, the damn editor every once in a <span style="color:red" data-ts="680.965" data-end_ts="681.005" title="680.965" id=c_"680.965">__while__</span>. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>Yeah. No, absolutely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, one of the things I like doing in my podcast is talking to people about their backgrounds and, and the combination of things that you guys do makes me really, really curious about where you're coming from. So could you tell me a little bit about your background, how you grew up, and how you became the artist that you are? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>Yeah, yeah. One, one thing that's definitely common between both Christina and I is that we <span style="color:red" data-ts="709.555" data-end_ts="709.635" title="709.555" id=c_"709.555">__were__</span> both choir kids from very early on. We both sang in children's choirs and for both of us, like singing and, and music was like our life. I mean, it was my life until, my dad recorded my band's first album in high school. <span style="color:red" data-ts="724.285" data-end_ts="724.405" title="724.285" id=c_"724.285">__I__</span> learned about music technology for me, grew up singing in choirs, singing in school. I guess another common thread for both of us is that we were also both theater kids, which I, I was at some point hesitant to always say, but I was talking with someone and they said that, theater is the gateway drug for creatives in high school. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christine: </b>And I do feel like a lot of the drama of who Arianne is definitely comes from our theater background, I'm sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>Yeah. Yeah. No, like we both brings, you know, at least I'm finding from myself and, and just from, from others, that that's like a big, a big part of what we do is the sort of like theatricality of it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christine: </b>So I would say like, you were definitely in the spotlight growing up, but then when you went to Indiana University, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>As soon as my, dad kind of turned me on to music technology, I kind of, I, I went in super hard and then I went to, Indiana University for recording arts, what they called it, recording degree. The nice thing about the program is that you basically get trained on, you know, recording orchestras and operas and, and, and ballets. So there's a lot of classical music rec recording. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="796.485" data-end_ts="796.565" title="796.485" id=c_"796.485">__would__</span>, I had always participated in the classical music, but that was, that's what like, really turned me on <span style="color:red" data-ts="801.325" data-end_ts="801.525" title="801.325" id=c_"801.325">__to__</span>, to that music. Christine, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christine: </b>I think you also realized a lot of things about who you were as a person having studied recording arts and recording others and editing other people's albums and other people's art. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>Yeah. I mean, well that took a after college to figure out. And I feel like a lot of people who get into the technical side of things, it's hard to tell if you're the kind of person who wants to help others create or if you want to do the creating. And it took me a long time because, I'm a technical person, so I just, I love like, you know, solving problems. So that part of it was really fulfilling to me, but it took me a long time to realize that doing my own creating was what was important. Sure. So that's, you know, sort of a general thread for me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christine: </b>Yeah. And so Ben talked a little bit about our backgrounds, but I always sang, I was always musical, children's choir, musical theater, all that stuff. And then I went to Indiana University, Jacob School of Music for voice performance. And I did a lot of choral singing and I did a lot in the early Music Institute. So a lot of like renaissance baroque music, didn't do a lot of opera. Then Ben and I had also started making music in college. So I was composing and creating with our own project. And then we moved to Milwaukee and I was singing in the opera company there. And Arianne still wasn't a thing. We were basically working on this studio album, meticulously recording and editing, and sat on it for two years and then realized it was really bad. <laugh> <laugh>. So we scrapped it and I'm glad we did. And then we moved to New York about four years ago. And really when we moved here was when Ariadne started. And I don't think it would've started otherwise. Not to say New York was the end all be all, but for us, it really made us work in a different way. Yeah. Which I think was really good and exposed us to what was happening, exposed us to new media, which <span style="color:red" data-ts="925.785" data-end_ts="926.005" title="925.785" id=c_"925.785">__we__</span> had no idea what that was before moving here. Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b><affirmative> No. Yeah. Well, and that, that album that we thankfully never put out is like the sort of genesis of Ariadne. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christine: </b>Yeah. I think we sat on this album and the main thing for us was we just wanted to play shows, but we had no idea how we were going to bring this album to life. How are we actually going to play this live? Arianne really started from an improvisatory in an improvisatory way. I mean, that's mainly what we do. We improvise every day, and much of our performances are very heavily improvised. And for us, that just opened up a completely new 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="966.705" data-end_ts="966.925" title="966.705" id=c_"966.705">__Way__</span>. Yeah. There was, the album was through composed and we were trying to figure out how to perform it, and there was no way to perform it without pushing play in some way. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So I, I, that, that made me super frustrated. 'cause that was <span style="color:red" data-ts="980.925" data-end_ts="981.165" title="980.925" id=c_"980.925">__what__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You, <span style="color:red" data-ts="981.365" data-end_ts="981.645" title="981.365" id=c_"981.365">__what__</span> you wanted to do. Yeah. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>No, there's no excuse for someone who knows that you don't have to push play <laugh>. Yeah. You know? Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christine: </b>And I, and I think for us, like being classical musicians and, you know, it's so amazing to see a violinist play and a drummer actually play their instrument. And that's the struggle with electronic music is for the most part, it's really boring to watch because buttons are really boring, but it's even more boring when it's actually not really live. And either the audience doesn't know or doesn't care and the performer doesn't care. And I don't wanna see someone sit behind a laptop and mix like, right. That's not why I'm going to see you unless it's an amazing sound system. And that's why I am there to hear your record. Right. On a sound system. Right. But for us, like Arianne started, because we wanna play our instruments, we want every sound we play to be live. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>So you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christine: </b>Can tell we're really passionate about that because electronic music can be just be so boring and it doesn't need to be. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, so what is it then in live performance that you do to provide that view of playing the instrument? Now obviously you're singing Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, which is a, a critical part of, of, your work. But how are the electronic sounds produced or generated, and how are you juggling that with also controlling live visuals? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>The music performance system came first and it basically came out of, we, we figured out we couldn't perform our album, so we decided to do 180 and, you know, just, learn how to improvise. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And we kind of just took six months and, and practiced couple hours a day just improvising. And through that, I kind of built this performance system for solving the problem of performing with computers. We haven't fully solved it yet. There's still buttons, but one huge step is just figuring out a way. And I don't think it's that hard to play with the laptop closed. You know, everyone knows what it looks like when someone's looking at a screen. It didn't want any of that connotation. And there's a couple problems that, you know, closing the laptop screen solves, you're not looking at a computer screen. But two, I mean, part of the problem with just creating with a digital tool is that, you know, potentially all possibilities are available. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, which is, you know, a bad thing, at least for me. And I, I think for a lot of people, if, you know, if you have a million choices, it's really difficult to make a decision. So closing a laptop screen narrows your choices to what controllers you have. Right now, we perform with, you know, the Ableton pushes, which are a nice expressive pad controller, but moving forward, we'd like to be using those less. And I've kind of been developing, these electroacoustic based instruments using sort of, machine learning to, you know, to be able to do physical gestures on a, you know, like a, a piece of wood or, or, or something, something more expressive, you know, multi-dimensional input for multi-dimensional output. I don't know if I totally explained that. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christine: </b>So we have <span style="color:red" data-ts="1179.315" data-end_ts="1179.805" title="1179.315" id=c_"1179.315">__Ableton__</span> pushes and we also currently, we have these spring <span style="color:red" data-ts="1183.595" data-end_ts="1183.885" title="1183.595" id=c_"1183.595">__like__</span> instruments from a guy who's based in Texas, company's called Electro Lobotomy. Is that right? Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Of course. Of course it is <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christine: </b>Yeah, <laugh>. But it's really cool. So mine is like a bunch of rods and springs on this big wooden thing that kind of runs across my sternum on a little like guitar strap. I can pluck it, I can hit it and it has a contact mic inside. But the coolest feature is Ben developed software so that I can run my voice through it and grab it in real time. So it's like a glitched out choir of myself <span style="color:red" data-ts="1216.545" data-end_ts="1216.765" title="1216.545" id=c_"1216.545">__Oh__</span>. That I sing over. All right. Yeah. And then it's the same with the push. I'm not doing any looping, but I'm actually grabbing my voice in real time, having a vocal phrase and playing that on my push in different octaves of a phrase, maybe I just sang Mm-Hmm. So it's a choir of myself in real time that I can change on the fly. Sure, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. I get it. So that's the whole sound, the whole music and sound system. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, which sounds like you already have about six arms worth of <laugh> Yeah. <laugh> controls to deal with. How do you manage the, how do you manage the visuals then? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>Yeah. So thankfully they, I didn't have to develop them both at the same time. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christine: </b>So we were touring with this performance system called Observance oh oh three. And we <span style="color:red" data-ts="1270.805" data-end_ts="1270.885" title="1270.805" id=c_"1270.805">__were__</span> performing with it all last fall. And the reason we developed it, was we applied to the Currents new media festival in New Mexico, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>My favorite festival in the world. Yeah. I love that place. Yeah. 
</p>

<b>Christine: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1281.985" data-end_ts="1282.205" title="1281.985" id=c_"1281.985">__So__</span> good. And that was in 2015. It was the first festival we ever applied to. We actually didn't really have everything all finished. No. But we were like, this is our proposal, and then we'll figure it out how to do it once. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>Yeah. I mean, we had, we had, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1296.745" data-end_ts="1296.965" title="1296.745" id=c_"1296.745">__not__</span> all we had was a proposal. We basically, we had done this audiovisual album, you know, which was all this audio reactive 3D renders, you know, not Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, not real time. You know, they were, the album was released on a, a micro SSD card, you know, they had the video files on. It 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christine: </b>Took millions of hours to render <laugh>. Yeah. Not fun. As you're rendering on the road on Tour <laugh>, the album's already supposed to be done. This is just how we roll <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Nice. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>So yeah. Yeah. That, that was, you know, a super, I I had never made a music video before, and then we'd tell ourselves we're gonna make an audio visual album. Yeah. Right. So our proposal for, for currents, was to, you know, the, we'll make the, the visuals that we, you know, made for this audio visual album, but we'll do 'em in real time live. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> basically, I used, touch designer and, and figured out a way to basically make a visual performance system that requires very little input from me so that, you know, we can be improvising and, and change musically and the, the system will, react accordingly. Got it. I basically, I, I, I only really, I, I, I change the scenes based on the mood. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But every, that's, that's kind of the only input, that it takes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christine: </b>Yeah. So there were about six scenes designed for that. And the scenes can change based on the mood, and then within each scene it always reacts in a different way, whether it's a cloth simulation or water, stuff like that. We'll react in real time to the music 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>In different ways. I was gonna ask to re when you talk about being reactive, it's, it's mm-Hmm. <affirmative> audio reactive to the music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>Yeah. Yeah. So there's audio reactive, light patterns that happen. And there's also, you know, there's a lot of physics simulations that are, reacting in real time to, different, audio features. I see. So if, if we're being really intense, you know, no matter kinda what the scene, the visuals will be intense too. And, and, you know, conversely, if we're being calm and quiet, or if we're being silent, if we're silent, you know, it should be black or, or, you know, near black. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, so you talk about how New York is what really kind of launched you forward with this. What were, what were the things, what were the influences of New York that that really made a difference for you? What, what specific things really lit you up? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christine: </b>I don't know if that's entirely true what I said, but true in the fact that we finally felt like there was a community and also there was an audience for Ariadne. So there were like-minded people. There were shows that we could play on that were appropriate. There were people that were gonna come to those shows. And then just meeting other artists and musicians that really inspired us. And also, there's just so many more shows to go to that I think we were very inspired in that way. But I would say the first tour we went on, we had only played two shows in New York, and then we decided to go on a tour <laugh>, and yeah, that was crazy. But we randomly had emailed this experimental radio station in Chicago and asked them if they could help us for, with a show. The person that ran that radio station was John Kates, who was like new media guru. Right. And I feel like he was also a huge reason how we understood what it was we were even doing <laugh>. Yeah. Before that we really didn't know what like new media art was. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>We <span style="color:red" data-ts="1515.195" data-end_ts="1515.395" title="1515.195" id=c_"1515.195">__found__</span>, found out through him that that's what we were doing. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christine: </b>Yeah. Just a random turn of events. Also, like the singing that I do here. Like, I have a church job, so Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I sing choral music every week. I don't know, I think subconsciously a lot of things just like infiltrated our being that 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>Yeah. I mean, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christine: </b>We weren't being exposed to before. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>Yeah. For, for me at least, like the, I'd never really known the hustle in air quotes, you know, until we came here. There's, you know, there's just a lot, lot of people. I mean, not that there's not everywhere else, but it's, it's good to be surrounded by people who are, you know, working super hard. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christine: </b>And I think that's what we needed. Right now, we're also both freelance, and I think that just allows us so much more time to create, whereas like beforehand, we were living in Milwaukee and like we, both of us could have never figured out how to be freelance there. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, but I would say, if you'll permit me this, it also sounds to me like you guys are a bit of stress junkies too. <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christine: </b>You're so right. <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Because you're, you're constantly putting yourself in fairly dangerous positions. Pretty sure that you're gonna be able to pull out of it before your nose hits the dirt. Right. <laugh>. What? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christine: </b>Yeah. Yeah. That's so funny. Stress junkie. I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Like that. Well, one of, what is it about that that ends up, I mean, it seems like almost the antithesis of doing, you know, this thoughtful, mindful spiritual music <laugh> on one hand, and on the other hand, like sweating bullets because you've got a bunch of rendering to do before you show up at the next gig, <laugh>. I mean, it seems like there's a, like, there's a a, a conflict there that's hard to resolve. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christine: </b>Yes. You could say it's like the dumb part of us from college that still never learned that that's not a good way to operate in life. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>I, I disagree. That is, it is a good way to operate. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christine: </b>I sometimes you should see us right now, I don't know. We're trying to do this web 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1643.085" data-end_ts="1643.125" title="1643.085" id=c_"1643.085">__T__</span> album. No. Yeah. We we're nose diving pretty hard right now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christine: </b>I, I think that we wouldn't have done anything we're doing now if we didn't operate that way, because all of it seemed very unrealistic. We also don't like to sit on material for a while. So like, the audio for our album was finished a long time ago. But I think both of us get really sick of things very quickly, so we wanna put it out as soon as possible. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>I mean, and maybe this is just how I, or, or, or we operate, but to get stuff done, I need to put myself in a situation where it's do or die. And I think I have a, I'm definitely like very optimistic about these things. And then they, they turn out to be super hard, but, you know, we make it happen. I mean, we've definitely failed after, you know, putting ourselves in those situations. But like, you, I mean, that's part of taking, taking risks is, you know, taken on the potential of, of failure. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm glad you said that because <laugh>, one of the things I always feel like, and, and it's for my own practice, I feel embarrassed sometimes that I've, I've put myself out there and I've really fallen flat, right? Yes. And I look back at it <span style="color:red" data-ts="1714.045" data-end_ts="1714.125" title="1714.045" id=c_"1714.045">__and__</span> I was like, oh, well, you know, it was because of this, or because, you know, it was in this place that I hadn't considered, or it was, you know, I was trying to do it on a nichols worth of technology and it needed something or whatever. You know, there was, yeah. There was reasons for it. I could understand after the fact, but it wasn't until I just literally jumped both feet into the fire that I knew if that it was gonna go that way or not. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christine: </b>Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>Yeah. No, absolutely. I mean, you have to, you, you gotta, there's no, you know, risk without reward. I don't know if that's the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1747.045" data-end_ts="1747.245" title="1747.045" id=c_"1747.045">__saying__</span>, but I mean, that's the way it's, it's been for us being comfortable with failure. I mean, you know, that's, I feel like a thing that lots of people talk about. You know, you gotta love failure. But I, I really try to, every time there's a failure, as long as I can figure out why it didn't work and, and make at least some sort of actionable steps to, to prevent that failure in the future. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christine: </b>Yeah. I mean, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>Nobody likes failure, but it's, it's good. Yeah. But it's good to, you know, look at it, at it positively. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So I like failure except, except when it's, you know, embarrassing in front of an audience, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christine: </b>Which has happened for sure. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I know. I hear ya. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So let's talk a little bit more about the development of, of your end <span style="color:red" data-ts="1794.445" data-end_ts="1794.845" title="1794.445" id=c_"1794.445">__results__</span>. So it sounds like you actually have two sort of like, results. One is the things necessary to put on a show. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah. And the other things, which are the things that are necessary to put out a release. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And so it sounds to me like your releases that you work on the music, you develop music and then you develop, you develop imagery to match it is, that's pretty much right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>Yeah. Yeah. That's, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1821.045" data-end_ts="1821.205" title="1821.045" id=c_"1821.045">__have__</span> you's ever 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Done it? Have you ever done it the other way around? Worked on the imagery first. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>We just recently did our first like, visual only thing. But I've never done the visuals first. Except, except for in the case, I guess you could say the performance, you know, when I, like, when I developed the visuals for the Currents new media festival, and then, and then we toured with that for the, you know, a year after we had a general kind of sense of, I mean, we, we had, I mean, for all this stuff we have mutual influences and we're thinking about the same thing. And a lot of times we, well, not a lot of times, you know, we always have sort of like, a spine, you know, like a general concept that we're going for. But the, I would say in a, in observance the, you know, I developed the visuals and then we, it's hard, it's hard to say 'cause it's improvised, but I know that we improvise differently with those visuals. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christine: </b>I see. But for like an album studio recording the music definitely informs the visuals. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1882.985" data-end_ts="1883.205" title="1882.985" id=c_"1882.985">__Yes__</span>. What Ben creates visually comes from the lyrical content of the album and the mood of the album. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, let's talk a little bit about that, because I mean, even there, you kind of bifurcated the music part of it as being sort of like a lyrical setup as well as a, you know, the, the coloring of it or the mood of it. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, quite frankly, I don't interview a lot of people that do music that has lyrics on it, period. And so it's kind of interesting to talk about it because there are several different traditions in music that has, that has words. There's sort of like the songwriter tradition where coming up with the words are then melded to music. Yeah. You know, you come up with the words first coming up with the right turn of phrase or whatever. There's other cases where the music is the driver and you come up with words to, to fit the music. Yeah. And in even other cases, there's a conceptual umbrella that causes, you know, that both the music and the words sort of like, serve that. Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1948.885" data-end_ts="1949.125" title="1948.885" id=c_"1948.885">__What__</span>, how, what is your mechanism and how do you meld those pieces together? And then what is the driving force behind the work that you do? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christine: </b>Improvising was something really, really new to me when I started. Like, as a classical singer, you never learn to improvise. It's totally different than jazz. So it was a very scary thing to do. But I always notice when I have fresh text, new text, I always improvise much better. So the text inspires me musically to improvise. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>You should talk about how you improvise with lyrics. 'cause that's like a, a weird thing. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Talking about that. I mean, even further because it's, it's hard to imagine, I mean, and again, going back to this sort of like split between, you know, there being a music and, and the background mood and the, and the thing, I mean, the first, the first thing I imagine is like, well, you got some music and then you just like glar words over it. Yeah. But it sounds to me like maybe that's not how you do it at all. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christine: </b>So our live performances are always inspired by something we've been working on. So it's not just some random text, the text is always prepared, but so in a live context, I have text up and I cycle through that text depending on the mood of the music. So I don't use all of the text. I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Have to tell you. I'm glad, I'm glad to hear that because when you first said that, I was like, oh my God, I can imagine getting up there and if all you <span style="color:red" data-ts="2034.365" data-end_ts="2034.445" title="2034.365" id=c_"2034.365">__are__</span> were thinking about is like, I have to pay a parking ticket, <laugh>, that would be a pretty devastating performance. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>Oh my 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christine: </b>God. You know? And also like, that's why improv music has bad, bad connotation because I do not, I cannot get on board with improv music that is just indulgent bss. Right. You know, and like that is not what we're 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>Like singing about you have a parking ticket. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christine: </b>Yeah. That's not what we're doing. That's not what we're about. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christine: </b>No, thank you. So in the live sense, that's, that's what's happening. This new album that's coming out on October 27th, it's called Staub <span style="color:red" data-ts="2072.775" data-end_ts="2072.935" title="2072.775" id=c_"2072.775">__Up__</span> Mater. And all of the texts for that album was inspired by, the visions from Christian female mystics. So like, Hildegard von Bing, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2083.585" data-end_ts="2083.935" title="2083.585" id=c_"2083.585">__Saint__</span> Theresa, and then fused together with this female dark surrealist poet. Her name is OA Berg. And her poetry is like super visceral and beautiful and grotesque. It's amazing. So that's how the text material formed for Staub <span style="color:red" data-ts="2101.295" data-end_ts="2101.455" title="2101.295" id=c_"2101.295">__at__</span> Mater. And so I had all of this text prepared, and when Ben and I wrote the album when we were improvising and rehearsing together, I used that text, but saying it in an improv way, so use that text, but the music just came out. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>Sure. Yeah. And we, we've said this before, but I think you made an interesting point how it's not, you know, the, the lyrics are a thing added on top, but for us, I feel like at at least just <span style="color:red" data-ts="2128.795" data-end_ts="2129.015" title="2128.795" id=c_"2128.795">__our__</span>, from an artistic inspiration standpoint, like, you know, that's where it starts. Yeah. I mean, for us it starts with literature and, and poetry. Right. And a lot of times like, well, I mean, we always, I mean, Christine obviously has the, you know, the lyrics she's written out, but the, what we're trying to say, you know, I feel like stems, you know, is rooted in, in those, those lyrics. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Right. So it, it actually, it's like kind of the opposite. It's like the, you know, the lyrics are sort of the, or the, at least the, the words are, you know, the foundational concept. Right. And then everything springs from there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christine: </b>So it's really not Yeah. It's really not aimless, you know? Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well it sounds very organic. It sounds like it's growing, you know? Yes. You're almost growing the, the tune based off of the seeds of this, of this literature. That's really interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christine: </b>And I don't think musically we ever would come up with the things we came up with if we were sitting down with pen and paper and Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>We would never write, or with the piano <span style="color:red" data-ts="2186.565" data-end_ts="2186.805" title="2186.565" id=c_"2186.565">__role__</span> we improvise, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, so given that you came from like this, this chorus choral background. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. How did you ever even allow yourself to think to become composers? You know, I, this is, this is the thing I'm always curious about with people is what did you do, or when was the point where you sort of gave yourself permission to be an improviser and to be a composer and to be, you know, to take on these artworks that aren't necessarily naturally part of the thing you grow up doing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christine: </b>Yes. And it's funny when you say composer too, because like, that's my imposter syndrome, <laugh>, you know, like I wasn't formally trained as a composer. So it's funny that you said that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>Yeah. But you know, the, you know, all the, the famous classical composers were, I can't say all, but, you know, some good examples of, you know, some of the best classical composers, Beethoven and Bach were super well <span style="color:red" data-ts="2247.005" data-end_ts="2247.165" title="2247.005" id=c_"2247.005">__known__</span> for their, for their improvisations. I mean, there's a, there's a quote about Beethoven, someone reviewing a a, a concert that he did, and, he just improvised a piece and, and, you know, the guy was saying like, everyone in the room was just weeping, you know? And, there's like this, I don't know if stigma is the right word, but there's this stereotype of the composer as, you know, having all, all this, theory and, you know, having, you know, mapping the piece out in their, in their head and then writing it down very precisely on a piece of sheet music. You can see in a lot of, in a lot of the scores that these things were improvised, you know, or like, based on improvisation, I don't think there's any need for imposter 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christine: </b>Syndrome. Yeah, yeah. On, on that. Yeah. But the improv in general just started because we wrote that studio album that we couldn't perform, and we knew we had a lot to say, and we knew we wanted to play out. We knew we wanted to create music and play shows. So it really just started because we didn't have any material. And we were like, well, let's just rehearse. Like, let's just start playing something and see what happens. We had done that for a couple months, and then we played a show, and I remember I thought we had played for like 30 minutes and we had only been up there 10 minutes <laugh>. And I remember walking up terrified that I had, I had no music prepared because before that I was doing like singer-songwriter, I was playing the piano. Things were very mapped out. Right. And for this, it was so horrifying to me that I was walking up with like, no agenda, like no plan of action. And we had played, we played for like 10 minutes and I thought it was like eternity. Right. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b><laugh>, but <span style="color:red" data-ts="2351.705" data-end_ts="2351.925" title="2351.705" id=c_"2351.705">__you__</span>, to answer your question for both of us, like feeling, feeling like, composers, I think <span style="color:red" data-ts="2360.235" data-end_ts="2360.725" title="2360.235" id=c_"2360.235">__started__</span>, started with Ariadne, but I mean, I, I think, I mean, Christine, you were writing your own music Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know, as a solo voice before Yeah. Before this stuff. So I think that started with you a lot earlier. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christine: </b>Yeah. And I think what's like still put me in the classical scene is that I really enjoy choral music. Like I enjoy collaboration. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And so for me, that's like just been why I am still doing it. But sometimes it, it started to feel very unnatural to learn art songs and to sing arias and to be a voice for somebody else's music in a solo way and someone else's text that necessarily, like it started to feel like it didn't really like speak to me and I felt really phony. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Unless I just really, like, there are some pieces, like I love Samuel Barber and I could sing all of his music, but there, you know, not every composer is like that. And I think, I don't know, I just always wanted to create, I always wanted to write my own music to perform. Yeah. Because that to me felt the most honest and the way I could be the most musical Yeah. With my instrument. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>I, I think the start of this project was a realization point for both of us that we didn't want to be interpreters. Yeah. And we wanted to, you know, have our own own voice. Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative>. Well, unfortunately, we've already burned through all our time. I have a million questions, but I'll have to say them for another time. All 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christine: </b>Good. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What I do, want to know is, so, you will have just released this album conceivably 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>What's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2462.375" data-end_ts="2462.455" title="2462.375" id=c_"2462.375">__next__</span> if we don't die in the process. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. I mean, so you've sweat sweated bullets. Yeah. And you all have released the, the project. What's next? Or is it just taking a long nap, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christine: </b>You know? Well, we're actually, no, no nap. This is why we're crazy. It's, 'cause then we're going on tour the first like two and a half weeks of November. It'll be like a smaller tour, east Coast Midwest. And then we'll be back and then we'll figure out the next thing 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b><laugh> Well, the next, the next thing is getting rid of all buttons and, and, and having a per perform performance instruments that are, you know, truly physical playable instruments. So that's, so 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Are you gonna go into lab yourself and design 'em or are you going to try and collaborate with other people to develop these? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin: </b>The, instruments that we got from, electro lobotomy have been just super inspiring in, in that like, there's a, a lot of creative possibility I feel like, with you know, and there's, there's already, I mean, we've already stuck like Arduinos and, and other like, sensors Yeah. In them. So I think <span style="color:red" data-ts="2532.895" data-end_ts="2532.975" title="2532.895" id=c_"2532.895">__because__</span> we're control freaks,

<b>Darwin: </b>Many thanks to Ben and Christine for spending the time. As you can tell, it was a lot of fun talking to them. Very animated and fun people. They are about to do this tour and they have just released this latest release. It's just come out and so you should rush on over to their website. It's pretty easy to find. If you can spell it, it's A-R-I-A-D-N-E rietta <span style="color:red" data-ts="2607.255" data-end_ts="2607.375" title="2607.255" id=c_"2607.255">__named__</span> music.band <span style="color:red" data-ts="2609.155" data-end_ts="2609.935" title="2609.155" id=c_"2609.155">__ka.com__</span>. And that new release just dropped on Friday. So it's there for the Pickens. Beyond that, I want to thank not only them, but thank you, the listeners for showing up every week. It's really been great. We're coming up on number 200 and we got some special stuff coming up around that. So I wanna thank you so much. And with that, I'll say goodbye to next week. Bye.
