<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. So there's a little music of me on Modular with my friend Andrew Pasch. I always really enjoy working with him. Today we are gonna talk to someone that I've done some performances with. He goes by the name of <span style="color:red" data-ts="26.945" data-end_ts="27.165" title="26.945" id=c_"26.945">__Ha__</span>, which sounds hilarious, when I try and say it, because I don't have the right accent for it. So, anyway, pardon my poor pronunciation, but I hope that you enjoy this. This is a really interesting interview, of a personal transition. Thanks. Okay. This week I have the pleasure of introducing you, I think to, someone who I've actually performed with in the past. He goes by the performing name. Alright, I'm gonna get this Really Ha, <span style="color:red" data-ts="59.025" data-end_ts="59.245" title="59.025" id=c_"59.025">__Har__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="59.945" data-end_ts="60.165" title="59.945" id=c_"59.945">__Har__</span>. There you go. Perfect. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>All great <laugh>. It's like, it's like Harry without the re 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>He, the official pronunciation guide is Harry, half of Harry with a Philadelphian accent. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Excellent. That's the way to put it. <span style="color:red" data-ts="75.525" data-end_ts="75.805" title="75.525" id=c_"75.525">__That__</span> that helps a lot. So he's, a really interesting guy. I got a chance to work with him in a trio setting with, Mike <span style="color:red" data-ts="85.105" data-end_ts="85.525" title="85.105" id=c_"85.105">__Matley__</span>. We did a performance at, planetarium Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And it was awesome. And I'll never forget that night you setting up your system, which was, I think you were working solely on bass that night. I can't remember if you had a guitar. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>I had a five string bass Okay. <span style="color:red" data-ts="103.805" data-end_ts="104.085" title="103.805" id=c_"103.805">__That__</span>, that Mike provided, and I also had a guitar as well, and I <span style="color:red" data-ts="107.885" data-end_ts="107.965" title="107.885" id=c_"107.885">__can__</span> Oh, you did? Okay. <span style="color:red" data-ts="108.445" data-end_ts="108.685" title="108.445" id=c_"108.445">__Jump__</span> back and forth on, back and forth between, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But what I mostly remember is the Ring of Pedals around you, which is like 50 deep <laugh>. It was unreal <laugh>, but it was, it always kinda stuck with me because you did really interesting, open ambient stuff, but you never, I never saw you actually get near a synthesizer. So it was, it, it kind of tweaked my head a little bit. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Then the other place that I I primarily know you from is for a long time, you, were a, I guess you'd call it a DJ or a content provider at Still <span style="color:red" data-ts="146.125" data-end_ts="146.405" title="146.125" id=c_"146.125">__Stream__</span>. Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>On Air personality, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, on air personality. There's, there's the words for it. Those are the different ways that I know, I know her. And I really wanted a chance to talk to him and find out, first of all, a little bit of how he got to where he is. And also, frankly, he's sHared with me a little bit. And what we have here is an artist kind of in transition. So it'll be kind of interesting to hear about that process as well. So with that, I welcome you. Hi <span style="color:red" data-ts="174.475" data-end_ts="174.765" title="174.475" id=c_"174.475">__here__</span>. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="175.585" data-end_ts="175.805" title="175.585" id=c_"175.585">__Ah__</span>, very good. Thank you darling. And thank you very much for inviting me. I'm very excited. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, this is really nice. It's, I always like having people that, that kind of like swing all over the map because, you know, I've had a lot of people on here that are doing, are kind of doing ambient synthesis work. So to have somebody who's got some chaps chops and doing that kind of music, but with completely different instrumentation is pretty interesting to me. Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b><affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, why don't you kick off by telling us a little bit about what kind of projects you're currently working on? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>Okay. In a nutshell, really, I'm the sort of person who kind of likes to stay very busy. So there's my own solo there works, which up until recently was, there's six different, releases that I have as solo ambient, dark ambient kind of music. And, in <span style="color:red" data-ts="224.325" data-end_ts="224.445" title="224.325" id=c_"224.325">__a__</span>, at the moment, I'm actually have swung off in a bit of a totally different direction away from ambient, but kind of taking the atmospheric element of the ambient with me. And I guess we can kind of go on into that a little bit in a little bit. That's, that's where a large port, part of my, the solo recording comes from. I'm also member of a, as far as a recording band, I'm a member of the, band, Christus and the Cosmonauts, which is myself and, synthesizer Wizard Singer, computer music magazine writer, Scott Soday, who, sings programs does all the synths. And I pretty much do all the guitars, basses, Chapman sticks, a little bit of the vocals here and there. And, we are getting ready to release our second album together. The last one came out in 2007. We're on, beta <span style="color:red" data-ts="275.685" data-end_ts="275.885" title="275.685" id=c_"275.685">__Act__</span> hammering records. Right. And, this has been an album that's really been in the making since the last one came out in 2007. So it's, it's kinda a long journey <laugh>. Right. And, long 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Gestation period. Huh. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="288.185" data-end_ts="288.405" title="288.185" id=c_"288.185">__Bur__</span> very, yeah. I mean, really right now Scott's working on the artwork. That's the other facet that he takes care of. He's an incredible graphic artist. So once that's all done, we're very excited about getting, getting this out there. 'cause it's, it's some really amazing stuff. And that, that kind of falls more into the progressive rock art, rock, experimental electronic psychedelic with a Filbert nut <laugh>. Right. Whatever you wanna call it, kind of thing. <span style="color:red" data-ts="312.125" data-end_ts="312.405" title="312.125" id=c_"312.125">__It's__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's funny that you mentioned that because I'd forgotten that you were a part of that project and, when I, I, at one point was doing some gear trading with Scott, and he was like, right. Yeah. He was like, I think I heard a <span style="color:red" data-ts="323.685" data-end_ts="323.805" title="323.685" id=c_"323.685">__use__</span> from somewhere, maybe my friend, my friend <span style="color:red" data-ts="326.705" data-end_ts="326.925" title="326.705" id=c_"326.705">__her__</span>. And I was like, oh, yeah, that's where you would've heard me from <laugh>. And so he actually sent me that album and, I quite enjoyed it. , thank you. Like you say, it's, I mean, there seems to be the start of a res renaissance of Prague. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> a little bit, but it's, I, you know, I hadn't really attuned to that yet. And, it was really kind of an eye-opener. It was really a pretty amazing piece of work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. The next one is, it, it kind of continues in a similar kind of vein. Scott's an amazing s storyteller. I mean, in general, just with the sort of songs that he writes. And we kind of went into more of an aggressive angle, shall we say, than the last one. It definitely, things got a little bit heavier, a little bit more angular with the guitars. It's definitely not the one of the more mellower things <laugh> we've ever done. Right. Which is a good thing. And the next one for all I know will probably do like Appalachian folk or something, just to throw everybody a monkey wrench, but 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="385.475" data-end_ts="385.765" title="385.475" id=c_"385.475">__Well__</span>, don't go that far 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b><laugh>. Hey, keep people on their toes, you know, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>So, let's see. There's that, there's the collaborative stuff that I've, <span style="color:red" data-ts="395.665" data-end_ts="395.885" title="395.665" id=c_"395.665">__you__</span> know, recordings that I've done of recent, a couple years ago, put out an album with, Altus Canadian artist Altus, who's an outstanding ambient artist who I've always been a big fan of. And he and I got together and did a particularly dark ambient project, which is interesting 'cause Altus music is very, very, it's just beautifully very well orchestrated. And the darker stuff is not really what most people think of from him. Right. And we, we, we come, came out with some real slit your wrists, kind of dark <laugh>. And, there's a project called, shadow District that, we released on the, the Earth Mantra Label. Okay. And that came out a couple of years ago. And it was, it, it seemed to go over very well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>I've also recorded, I also did an interesting project a couple of years ago with, actually with one of the label mates on beta-lactam, ring Records. A, Chilean artist goes by the name of Fando Loop. He's, his actual name is <span style="color:red" data-ts="450.815" data-end_ts="451.165" title="450.815" id=c_"450.815">__Mikel__</span>, Leroy. And he's part of a band called Festal. And, he's based down the Santiago <span style="color:red" data-ts="458.685" data-end_ts="458.925" title="458.685" id=c_"458.685">__Chili__</span>. We've been talking for years that we'd like to try to do something. So we put out an album a couple years ago. It was me, him, and also I believe his wife playing flute. And it was a, how to describe it was a kind of avant-garde, progressive rock, reformed jazz. It's ambient noise, scaping, everything <laugh>. And, and the whole thing is literally just one. It's, it's kind of like a story. It has a, that just goes through various cycles all the way through it, but it's really just one long track. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>Wow. And I was, I really, really enjoyed doing it 'cause it was kind of unlike anything I had ever done before. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And that, that was really exciting. Did a couple other little things. Another good friend of mine over in, in the UK guy, goes by the name of Cousin Silas, who's a excellent ambient guitarist ambient artist in general. He tends to be more on the darker side. And, I've done a couple of tracks with, on a couple of his, his solo projects as well, playing guitars. And so it's been a lot of fun as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Well, so you've, you, it sounds like you really have a varied, kind of the ability to slot yourself into a wide variety of sounds. I mean, you Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you've already right there, mapped out a lot of different genres that, that you are dancing in. One of the things I like doing in the podcast is asking people what their background is, you know? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> how they work themselves into the position of where they are. And this sounds, sounds particularly interesting because, it sounds like the answer might be insane. So <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>Could you very well may be correct. <span style="color:red" data-ts="557.735" data-end_ts="558.085" title="557.735" id=c_"557.735">__Jesus__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. So could you tell us a little bit about, what you're, what you've gone through to become the artist that you are? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>Well, let's see. It starts out with, there was a piano in my parents house. I'm, I started out formal, formal training on piano, and originally was for my sister to take piano lessons. And I kind of started tinkering around with it when I was very, very little. And my brother also was, you know, had a guitar. And he was very much into the ventures and surf music and stuff like that, which also had a very major impact on me as well, which is going the slight aside. I also play live, fairly regularly with a surf <span style="color:red" data-ts="597.355" data-end_ts="597.595" title="597.355" id=c_"597.355">__punk__</span> band that I've <span style="color:red" data-ts="598.675" data-end_ts="598.715" title="598.675" id=c_"598.675">__been__</span>, that I've been playing on and off with for the past. We did the math after our last gig a month or so ago, and we've been playing on and off for about 30 years. Wow. So there's, so there's that in there too. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>But my parents wanted me to try to take the piano a little bit more seriously, and they were trying to convince me to take lessons with my uncle, who was a piano teacher. And I was like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="619.555" data-end_ts="619.715" title="619.555" id=c_"619.555">__yeah__</span>, I don't know if I <span style="color:red" data-ts="620.955" data-end_ts="621.115" title="620.955" id=c_"620.955">__wanna__</span> do this or anything. And at that point in time, my favorite song in the world was <span style="color:red" data-ts="626.305" data-end_ts="626.595" title="626.305" id=c_"626.305">__even__</span> from Shaft by Isaac <span style="color:red" data-ts="627.815" data-end_ts="628.035" title="627.815" id=c_"627.815">__Hay__</span>. And my parents made a deal with me. I tell you what, if you agree to take, you know, weekly regular piano lessons, take it seriously, you can learn how to play <span style="color:red" data-ts="639.445" data-end_ts="639.795" title="639.445" id=c_"639.445">__theme__</span> from Shaft. And my eyes just went binging. And I was like, really? Well, okay then, you know, so I was, I was all psyched and happy. And I took piano lessons for many, many years. And ironically, I never did learn how to play theme from shaft <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>But, but that's pretty much where it started. Formal piano lessons, going all the way up through my teams. So I started out on keyboards. I started playing synthesizers while I was in high school. I started out with an <span style="color:red" data-ts="668.715" data-end_ts="668.835" title="668.715" id=c_"668.715">__a__</span> Oy, which at that point in time, apparently was fairly rare <laugh> these days. <span style="color:red" data-ts="673.935" data-end_ts="674.155" title="673.935" id=c_"673.935">__You__</span> know, every kid has a synthesizer or two, just anyone, his laptop or something. Right. About when I was about, I'm <span style="color:red" data-ts="683.075" data-end_ts="683.155" title="683.075" id=c_"683.075">__gonna__</span> say about 15 or 16 or so, I started, I started playing guitar and bass simultaneously. An interesting story behind that is I started learning from a friend of mine who I had grown up with all through grade school and everything, and he was taking guitar lessons. So he is like, oh, come on over. And I <span style="color:red" data-ts="699.835" data-end_ts="699.955" title="699.835" id=c_"699.835">__can__</span>, as I learned, I'll show you some things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>And I picked up a few things from him. And over time he kinda lost interest in it and got more interested in buying guns, so, and collecting ammunition. So basically he sold me his guitars and his bases so he can go out and buy ammo for his gun collection, Uhhuh <affirmative>. So I started kind of getting into, you know, playing <span style="color:red" data-ts="720.665" data-end_ts="720.885" title="720.665" id=c_"720.665">__get__</span>, I started building up my guitar collection essentially to help feed a friend's, you <span style="color:red" data-ts="725.765" data-end_ts="725.885" title="725.765" id=c_"725.765">__know__</span>, gun habit <laugh>. Right. So that, that kind of progressed from there. So let's see. I started playing professionally, literally right outta high school. Instead of going to college, I made the mistake of, you know, I'm just gonna put this off for a year. Right. It's okay, mom and dad, and I'll, I'll really I'll, I'll go to college. I'll get back to it. There's this band I want to join. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>And literally, the very last day of school, as everybody in high school was going around signing yearbooks, there was this guitar player, who was like, Hey, I hear you're a, you're a keyboard player and you've got a synthesizer. Would you be interested in joining a band? I'm like, Ooh, okay. And well, I went, and that turned into a career through most of the eighties of playing various cover bands, playing hair metal and, pop and lounge music, and, all manner of things like that. <laugh>, right. New wave, you name it. And, that moved on. Now that was my main instrumentation was primarily keyboard through most of that time. Wow. Okay. Yeah. So I built up a, a pretty decent stack of keyboards back then. I think my biggest attack during the early eighties, I think I had nine synth on stage with me at one time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>Oh <span style="color:red" data-ts="795.745" data-end_ts="795.965" title="795.745" id=c_"795.745">__my__</span>. Is what this is. Back when I was really, really wanted to be Jeff Downs from Asia <laugh>. Right, right. Everybody did. Oh, yeah. And then he saw the Phite, and it was like, I wanted <span style="color:red" data-ts="804.825" data-end_ts="805.045" title="804.825" id=c_"804.825">__TV__</span> screen on screen on stage <span style="color:red" data-ts="806.585" data-end_ts="806.805" title="806.585" id=c_"806.585">__two__</span> <laugh>. So no, as soon as <span style="color:red" data-ts="808.745" data-end_ts="808.965" title="808.745" id=c_"808.745">__no__</span> Roland came out, the S 50 sampler where you <span style="color:red" data-ts="810.885" data-end_ts="810.965" title="810.885" id=c_"810.885">__can__</span> plug in a little monochrome monitor, I was like, oh, I'm so there <laugh>. Right. So I had that up on stage with me and everything. And, I would play guitar. I was actually, I would play guitar in various bands, but I never really got formal training on guitar. So trying to play guitar properly on cover bands. Well, let's put it this way. I was actually fired from playing guitar twice over the course of the years that I was playing. And, little by little I also started playing bass and I started focusing more on bass as far as that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>And it seemed like I, I gravitated better to playing bass in, at least in a rock band environment. So, over the course of time, I wound up, you know, I bought my first serious base, which is a, a fretless fender that I had. And I kind of started building up a local reputation as being a fretless bass player, kind of careening away from the keyboard end of things for a while. And I kinda let the keyboard settled down and I started realizing, you know, this is a little bit more fun than playing keyboards. 'cause at least at that point in time, playing keyboards just felt like a desk job to me. Right, right. Okay. I'm stuck in this one part of the <span style="color:red" data-ts="870.005" data-end_ts="870.245" title="870.005" id=c_"870.005">__space__</span>. <laugh>, I can't move. I even <span style="color:red" data-ts="871.605" data-end_ts="871.765" title="871.605" id=c_"871.605">__ha__</span> I even did the key guitar thing during the eighties. I had the, the, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="874.595" data-end_ts="874.885" title="874.595" id=c_"874.595">__Corg__</span> RK 100, and I, I was running around with like a 30 foot <span style="color:red" data-ts="877.565" data-end_ts="877.805" title="877.565" id=c_"877.565">__mini__</span> cable, you know, the dork I was and, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>But eventually I started noticing <span style="color:red" data-ts="883.005" data-end_ts="883.165" title="883.005" id=c_"883.005">__it__</span>. It was funny because the, the bass player who I played with <span style="color:red" data-ts="885.545" data-end_ts="885.765" title="885.545" id=c_"885.545">__is__</span> this guy named Frank <span style="color:red" data-ts="886.825" data-end_ts="887.045" title="886.825" id=c_"886.825">__Ano__</span>, who I, I consider my, my bass teacher, Uhhuh <affirmative>, who taught me how to play properly in terms of Right, right hand technique and everything. And he said something one day that kind of sunk into my head. <span style="color:red" data-ts="895.605" data-end_ts="895.805" title="895.605" id=c_"895.605">__It__</span> was kind of like, well, I was setting up my equipment, which would usually take like two hours to set up, and then two hours at the end of the night to break down again. And he said, you know, every morning I get up and I look in the, go in the bathroom and I look in the mirror and I say, thank God I'm not a keyboard player, <laugh>. He goes, all I've gotta do is I bring my base, I bring my amp, and I bring my cable. I plug in and I'm done. And then at the end of the night, I unplug and I'm done. And something went into my head and went dinging. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>That, that, that sounds like fun, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, it's funny because it's funny you say that because sometimes when you get so serious about a musical avenue or a musical, your own musical expectations, you forget that the thing's supposed to be fun. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>Exactly. Yeah. I mean, it's, it's not, if it's, if it's, if music just like anything else, if it's turns into a drag, I mean, you know, you might as well just be doing the day job. Right. There's easier ways and <span style="color:red" data-ts="951.395" data-end_ts="951.685" title="951.395" id=c_"951.395">__know__</span> to, to make money and less of aggravation, if you think of it that way. At least you're trying to look at that as a form of income. Right. But little by little, I just kind of migrated least as far as live performance. 'cause sir, and I started, I, <span style="color:red" data-ts="962.665" data-end_ts="962.885" title="962.665" id=c_"962.665">__in__</span>, in a rock band context, I started playing, <span style="color:red" data-ts="965.385" data-end_ts="965.605" title="965.385" id=c_"965.385">__no__</span>, just focusing on bass. And eventually I went through, I played, played in a hair, a couple hair metal bands back in the eighties. I eventually wound up playing in the surf band that I'm now in, which I actually started playing in, I'm gonna say roughly around the end of the eighties. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>And the, it's this guy Mike Raymond, who I've been playing with on and off for about 30 years. And we, we both have a, a sHared love of old instrumental ver surf music, like the Ventures, Dick Dale, sandals. That's, that's the other thing. The <span style="color:red" data-ts="997.625" data-end_ts="997.845" title="997.625" id=c_"997.625">__now__</span> if, if you ever, if you ever look on my website, I, <span style="color:red" data-ts="999.685" data-end_ts="999.845" title="999.685" id=c_"999.685">__on__</span> my bio page, the first paragraph tends to confuse people. 'cause I mentioned that the first two albums that I ever owned, which I inherited from my brother and my sister was, the soundtrack to the Endless Summer by the Sandals <laugh> in Instrumental, instrumental surf classic album. Right. Which, which is really had a ma major, major impact on everything I do still. And, Rubicon by Tangerine Dream. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Wow. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>So you kind of combine <span style="color:red" data-ts="1026.445" data-end_ts="1026.605" title="1026.445" id=c_"1026.445">__these__</span> two, there's a combo. Yeah. So you get surf music and you get Tangerine Dream and you say, wow, this guy is just a train wreck. <laugh> <laugh>. And, so the No, that's, I, I've always had a very, very, very deep love of, of instrumental surf music. So Mike and I have been playing, like I said, on and off <span style="color:red" data-ts="1044.125" data-end_ts="1044.325" title="1044.125" id=c_"1044.125">__with__</span> different bands. And we started up again about a year and a half, two years ago. And, now we even have his 13 year old son playing, doing Utility Man for us playing drums and bass and guitar and keyboards, depending on what song it is. And it's, it's fun. Like I said, that's the main thing, like you said, it comes down to this, is I've played in a lot of, a lot of cover bands where you spend a lot of time and you get really bogged down in minutiae. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>And it's like, okay, we're gonna get the four part Perfect Crosby Stills Nash style Harmonies. Right. And we're gonna practice three times a week and we're gonna get everything razor perfect. And then when I started playing again with, with, with the surf band, about a year, a year and a half ago, we had not played in 15 years. And we were like, you know what? It was literally, it was, it was a, a somebody had asked if we could put the band together as a, as a birthday present <span style="color:red" data-ts="1088.505" data-end_ts="1088.725" title="1088.505" id=c_"1088.505">__for__</span> somebody. Okay. Wanna get together and just do a one <span style="color:red" data-ts="1090.365" data-end_ts="1090.525" title="1090.365" id=c_"1090.365">__off__</span> gig Sure. At this bar. And I'm like, yeah, sure. So we got together, walked into this bar. We had not played together in over 12 years, no practice, no <span style="color:red" data-ts="1098.245" data-end_ts="1098.405" title="1098.245" id=c_"1098.245">__nodding__</span>, plugged in. And it was just like, like time never was there. It just bang. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>We just went right back into it again and we're laughing and we're having a fun time. And it sounds like a 12 car crash and everything. It's like, no, we ended it with, well thanks a lot. We'll see you again in another 20 years. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And it was like, well, that was fun. Well, I guess that's not, what do you mean you want us to come back next month? <laugh>. Oh man. That's great. And it's turned into a regular thing, and we still have not practiced in that many years still. And it's like, we don't wanna spoil our purity 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Oh, that's hilarious. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>Yeah. But it just comes down to, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1128.485" data-end_ts="1128.685" title="1128.485" id=c_"1128.485">__it__</span>, it's supposed to be enjoyable. Right. This is, this is supposed to be something that you have fun with. It shouldn't, it should not be a drag. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So you talk about having started off as keyboardist <span style="color:red" data-ts="1140.925" data-end_ts="1141.125" title="1140.925" id=c_"1140.925">__to__</span> moved into, to, into bass primarily. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and then Right. Occasionally guitar, at least as an option to get kicked out of bands. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b><laugh>. Right. Exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, how much of that translated because it, what what's interesting is, I've known, over the years, I've known a couple of situations where really good studio players Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> would double on keyboard and bass. There was something about that transition. They, keyboardists found it very, I wouldn't say easy, but they, they found the transition to be sensible for 'em, but also something that they found really enjoyable. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What, what might be that connection? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>I, I always kind of wondered about that. And what I, the closest thing I can, I can really think of is, if you think about it at least playing piano, not so much synthesizer, but playing a keyboard. It's, it's a percussion instrument. I mean, there, there's, there's physical impact of your fingers hitting the thing. It can get a little visceral as you're kind of hitting the thing, at least when you're playing like a real piano. And when you're playing bass, it's a rhythm instrument. It's a very visceral instrument that you feel the impact of the notes. Right. You feel bass notes when No, they always say, when the bass player stops playing in a band, you hear it. Right. You may not hear, you may not hear the actual notes he, he plays, but when he stops, wow. You hear it. Yeah. It's a very much, it's, it's a visceral feeling that you get when you're playing it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>So it's, it's a physical kind of thing. And I always kinda likened playing bass, and I guess in a way from playing piano. 'cause I have a tendency to play very, when I would play very percussively on piano, especially, I would do things like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1238.195" data-end_ts="1238.805" title="1238.195" id=c_"1238.195">__landlines__</span> down on, on Broadway by Genesis, which has a very hand overhand, interlocking, percussive kind of, playing technique. And I, I really have, I've always kind of theorized that a lot of us are kind of very frustrated drummers. You know, we really, so it's kind of like, you know, piano, it's kind of a percussive instrument. Bass, it's a rhythm instrument which locks in with the drums and the percussion. It just seemed to make sense. And when I started playing Chapman's stick, which is even more of a percussive instrument, and most people usually think of Chapman's stick as being some kind of a super bass, when reality, it's, it's a full range instrument. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>It <span style="color:red" data-ts="1276.445" data-end_ts="1276.565" title="1276.445" id=c_"1276.445">__had__</span>, you have bass notes, you have guitar notes, know <span style="color:red" data-ts="1278.525" data-end_ts="1278.645" title="1278.525" id=c_"1278.525">__what__</span> they <span style="color:red" data-ts="1278.805" data-end_ts="1278.925" title="1278.805" id=c_"1278.805">__call__</span> melody side of the instrument. But you play it very percussively. It's all done with tapping. And one of the first things that they, they, in the lesson book that Emmett Chapman has is to literally strap on the instrument and do like drum rudiments on the instrument on your chest. Literally, like, without even paying attention to the notes. And that seemed to appeal to me as well. So I guess really what it comes down to the parallel between playing the piano or keyboards to a degree. And because I always, when I play organ parts, like e three parts in various songs, I, I tended to play very percussively. I guess it's, it's, I'm a frustrated drummer, <laugh>. That's really what it comes down to. Sure. And I guess there's a parallel there between the two of them. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. No, the, the interesting next step then though is that you are <span style="color:red" data-ts="1322.955" data-end_ts="1323.245" title="1322.955" id=c_"1322.955">__prim__</span>, primarily known for doing this dark ambient stuff. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, which often doesn't have a clear percussive element to it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>Right. It, it, it normally does not, it 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Normally does not. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>That's something though that while a lot of the stuff that I, I I recorded and I've played, and played with other people, it does tend to be somewhat beatless. But even in that case, I'm still thinking in terms of beats and structure. Okay. Which, which seems to throw some people off. Especially when, like for example, if I'm doing a live performance, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1358.715" data-end_ts="1359.005" title="1358.715" id=c_"1358.715">__what__</span>, what I, when I was doing the radio show, I would be doing a live performance and obviously the only thing that people could hear was what was being going through my mixer and going broadcast out through the stream. Right. What they didn't hear was that I have a metronome clicking Wow. Click, click, click. A very, very solid thing. And what I was playing was not particularly mechanically, you know, metronomic and very locked onto a beat, but I was still thinking in terms of, of beat and structure, even though I've always been, you know, hear people talking about with ambient music, it's like, oh, it has to be beatless, it has to be honorable. You know, the whole, the whole <span style="color:red" data-ts="1396.385" data-end_ts="1396.605" title="1396.385" id=c_"1396.385">__in__</span> ossification concepts. Right. Which I, I honestly never really bought into. And 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, some of it is a little, I mean, the, the fact that that the claim is it has to be ignorable is Yeah. That's, that's, that's led to a lot of unfortunate results. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>Yes. I absolutely agree. I mean, it, it, it's funny, a couple days ago I was, I was up until about two 30 in the morning and I was, I was working on my current project and I was just kind of staring at the computer for a while. And I don't know what drove it to me probably. 'cause it was two 30 in the morning and no, I wasn't putting sentences together very well. Anyway, so I did the first thing that most people do at two 30 in the morning when they're stupid. And they went on Facebook, <laugh> and <laugh>. I, I posted up onto my wall a short four bullet treaties on why I had started moving away from quote unquote pure ambient music. And one of them was, I'm too much of a goddamn ham to create ignorable ignorable music. Right. You know, I'm sorry. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>A lot of what I do as an artist is look at me <laugh>, you know, and I'll be the first to admit it. And the idea of being ignorable just, it never locked into me. And the same with the idea of it's not supposed to have a beat. Well, well, people may not be hearing a beat, but I'm, I'm thinking a beat, I'm thinking in terms of build structure, you know, climax, release, tension release all through the thing. I'm thinking in terms of themes, I don't like, that's the other, one of the other bullet points on there is I'm bored to death <span style="color:red" data-ts="1481.525" data-end_ts="1481.765" title="1481.525" id=c_"1481.525">__with__</span> stasis. Yeah. You <span style="color:red" data-ts="1483.325" data-end_ts="1483.405" title="1483.325" id=c_"1483.325">__know__</span>, I don't like the idea of No, no. I can understand the concept of drones and, and their purpose in ambient music. But when you have something where you've got 15 minutes, that's essentially one note, it's, I I have problems reconciling that with something that I kind of enjoy. One, one of the things that I did with, with the radio show, when I would have a new artist who would send, send music to me to play on the show, I had a test that I always did every single time. I would put it on, let's say it's like a 15 minute track, which is kind of a, the equivalent of a 45 single <span style="color:red" data-ts="1515.555" data-end_ts="1515.845" title="1515.555" id=c_"1515.555">__nami__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. It's typical, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1516.795" data-end_ts="1517.085" title="1516.795" id=c_"1516.795">__yeah__</span>. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>Right. And I would listen to the first 30 seconds, and then I'd pass forward it, and then a bit, and I'd listen to it again, and I'd pass forward again. I maybe jump about five or six different times over the course of this thing. And the, the, the acid test to me was that if over the course of the entire thing of these six or seven or eight jumps over the, the duration of this track, if I heard the exact same thing at every point. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Did you hear progression or not? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>Right. Right. Exactly. And it's like, if I'm hearing stasis, if I'm hearing exactly the same thing for 10 minutes, no, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1548.445" data-end_ts="1548.565" title="1548.445" id=c_"1548.445">__I__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1548.605" data-end_ts="1548.725" title="1548.605" id=c_"1548.605">__I__</span>, I'm sorry. This is, this is not what I'm looking for. And it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1552.835" data-end_ts="1553.125" title="1552.835" id=c_"1552.835">__that__</span>, that just never really clicked with me. And that's between that, the, the ignorable concept and everything else, it's one of the reasons why I kind of started finding myself fading away from that. And the idea of, of ambient music seems to be synonymous with no soothing and relaxing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. You are no longer doing the still <span style="color:red" data-ts="1574.485" data-end_ts="1574.805" title="1574.485" id=c_"1574.485">__stream__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>No 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Programming. Was that, why did you leave? Was it just that your change in tastes? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>It's, it was a combination of, of an, of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1585.085" data-end_ts="1585.205" title="1585.085" id=c_"1585.085">__a__</span> several things. It was partially was a, was a change in tastes. Partially, it, it was all those various things about not just ambient music, but kind of, for want of a better word, the ambient, ambient people, I guess you can call it. And, and this pleased anybody listening to this, don't take this as a generalization, but every genre obviously, is going to have your, let's just cut to the chase your sHare of blowHards. Right. And, and ambient music is <span style="color:red" data-ts="1619.545" data-end_ts="1619.765" title="1619.545" id=c_"1619.545">__as__</span> no shortage of, of blowHards as much as any other genre of music. Okay. And, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1626.925" data-end_ts="1627.125" title="1626.925" id=c_"1626.925">__kinda__</span> have, like, like I said, I come from, I come from a Harder background. Sure, sure. I come from a, I come from a punk background. I come from a metal background. I come from a Prague rock background. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>The idea of something that's supposed to be full of you, spiritual goodness and light, you, you know, you study your chakras and your previous life as a giraffe <span style="color:red" data-ts="1650.035" data-end_ts="1650.325" title="1650.035" id=c_"1650.035">__know__</span>, studying your crystals vibrational wonder know, think when you start hearing words like this. I, I, I'm, I'm as, as one of the other bullet points I put on that Facebook thing is, I'm, I'm about as, as New Wave as as Rob Zombie, <laugh>. Right, right. I mean, not New Wave, new Age. Yeah. Yeah. And, and there's, there's this unfortunate connection, which isn't really true. That the idea of I, when I started doing Zombie <span style="color:red" data-ts="1673.405" data-end_ts="1673.605" title="1673.405" id=c_"1673.405">__at__</span> Music, I mean, all the people I used to know, know in mourn, the rock circles were kind of like, oh man, I can't believe you're doing that. That Yani new <span style="color:red" data-ts="1680.525" data-end_ts="1680.765" title="1680.525" id=c_"1680.525">__weight__</span>, new age stuff. And I'm like, no, that's, that's not what I'm doing at all. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Did you ever, did you ever feel like you had to go way out of your way to, focus on artists or even your own work that was, that had more of an edge to it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>No, not really. And that might've been one of the reasons why I eventually kind of moved away from it, because I kind of felt a little bit of at odds bless to, to what was kind of going on within that universe. It was kind of a given that when I, when I started doing the show, I mean, I, I specifically started, I mean, the show was Nights Scaping Radio. I specifically started the show with the idea that I wanted to focus on what I looked at as a niche within a niche, which was dark ambient music within ambient music itself. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, it was kind of literally the black sheep of, of, of what was supposed to be most people thought of, again, the soothing, relaxing music. And a lot of dark ambient music is, well, it's about soothing and relaxing if you know, if, if you like nightmares. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. I was gonna say it's nightmarish. It's cinematic. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>Yeah. Which, which to me is, is something I, I enjoy <laugh>, you know, and I enjoy that, that kind of very visual that, that to me is the biggest thing of all about, about ambient music that appealed to me. It's a very visual, intensely visual vivid kind of music. And be it dark or otherwise, it, it, it generates immediate pictures in your head, or at least it should in my book. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, it, it really just kind of came down to, I know people, we, I would actually get people who would, would come running into the chat room during the show, 'cause it'd be a first <span style="color:red" data-ts="1772.205" data-end_ts="1772.365" title="1772.205" id=c_"1772.205">__one__</span> I was doing.

And we would've people who would come in very, very upset, <laugh>, and they would be like, man, I'm trying to, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1781.865" data-end_ts="1782.085" title="1781.865" id=c_"1781.865">__no__</span>, I put on still <span style="color:red" data-ts="1782.805" data-end_ts="1783.045" title="1782.805" id=c_"1782.805">__stream__</span> every night so I can get a good relaxing night's sleep and you're Harshing my mellow man. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>That's an exact quote. That's an exact quote. I actually got to people actually said that. And, you know, so, so I finally, I finally, I, I made my official tagline for the show as I'm not here to help you fall asleep <laugh>. Right. You know, if, if you're gonna listen to my show, you, you, you, you've got a 50 50 shot that you're gonna have sonic images of hell in a good way, <laugh> Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know, and either you're gonna like that or appreciate it, or you may want to take a miss on, on this station for the next couple of hours. And there were definitely people, a lot of people who appreciated it. There's, there was some people who didn't appreciate it. And, again, I guess it's, it's my old punk rock mentality that kind of come, came back into play again where it was, okay, it's, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1835.465" data-end_ts="1835.685" title="1835.465" id=c_"1835.465">__you__</span> know, you expect, you expect this, well, I'm gonna go do this because this is what I do, whether you like it or not. A bit of an irritant. It's a little bit of a fly in the ointment. I understand. But, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>How long did you, how long did you do the show? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>A little over five years. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So I ended <span style="color:red" data-ts="1852.985" data-end_ts="1853.205" title="1852.985" id=c_"1852.985">__You__</span> enjoyed being, you enjoyed being the fly, fly the ointment then, apparently, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>To a degree. Yeah. I mean, but the, but the other main thing to me was that I was getting an opportunity, and this was the other real driving factor for me for really doing the show in general, was that it was giving me an opportunity to get a lot of music out there of artists who were into this sub genre, this niche, within a niche that really I thought was being underrepresented. That, that, you know, there was, I mean, if you, there's other stations out there like Soman, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1882.565" data-end_ts="1882.845" title="1882.565" id=c_"1882.565">__FF__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1882.845" data-end_ts="1883.005" title="1882.845" id=c_"1882.845">__which__</span> has a dedicated channel doomed, which is, you know, very, very dark ambient and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1887.285" data-end_ts="1887.565" title="1887.285" id=c_"1887.285">__know__</span>, obviously there's certain places that do that, but a lot of people, it's, you know, there's, shall we say, there's definitely certain, sacred Cals in the ambient field who, if you look at most radio ambient related radio stations, there are certain people who are gonna be, you know, permanently glued to the top two or three. Right. And, nothing against that, but, my, everybody's kind <span style="color:red" data-ts="1907.125" data-end_ts="1907.165" title="1907.125" id=c_"1907.125">__of__</span> like, how come you're not playing, you know, x, y, z Sacred <span style="color:red" data-ts="1909.425" data-end_ts="1909.645" title="1909.425" id=c_"1909.425">__Cal__</span>. Right. It's like, well, they're doing very, very well. They're at the top of every cHart in the world. I really don't think they're going to hurt if my little show does not each of them. Right. And I try to focus on some much smaller, independent, and it's kind of strange saying independent in, in <span style="color:red" data-ts="1925.645" data-end_ts="1925.765" title="1925.645" id=c_"1925.645">__a__</span>, in a niche

But there's, there was just so many amazing, incredibly amazing artists that, that I, I found and that I got to actually, you know, interact with and, and ultimately became really good friends with. Right. And I, my main, my main driver for the show was the idea of, I wanna get this music out there and I want people to be able to hear this. And they can have a kind of a place where they can come and listen. And if there's, they wanna come to the chat room, they can kind of, you know, feel comfortable to kind of drop any, any four letter expletives that they like in there without Oh my gosh. You know, sort of thing. Right. And, it, it, it was enjoyable. But, you know, and I, and I, and I, I definitely relish the time that I had with it was, it was a wonderful experience, but it started becoming where it's just in, in terms of pure ambient music. Like I said, it's, I started feeling a little dissociated with it. Sure. And, I started feeling a desire to, I mean, in a nutshell, to get back to actually doing songs.

And it, it's interesting because yeah, I've, I've found a lot of, a lot of the people who, at least who seem to have, who enjoy the darker elements of ambient seem to also seem to have an appreciation for the Harder parts of rock. Right. Metal stuff like that, but not the other way around is what I've always found interesting. Hmm. I, I'll, I'll, I know, know some of the, the heaviest head bangers out there who are very, very open-minded to, to ambient stuff and stuff like that.

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> completely unopen to anything else. Sure.

<p>
<b>Har: </b>Exactly. And it was like, ha ha, you should have seen me back around 1983 <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, it's, it's funny though that that's the case, because if you really think about it from, you know, and if we go to the, if we assume that, you <span style="color:red" data-ts="2119.485" data-end_ts="2119.685" title="2119.485" id=c_"2119.485">__know__</span>, I mean, I know there's a lot of ways to map out the history of ambience ambient music, and there's even that guy that did the whole book on it, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But I mean, I think, I think one of the central threads of modern ambient is really coming from Eno's, you know, the roots of Eno, but he kind of largely looked at it as an, as an experimental music, not as a zone out music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>Exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And so it's kind of funny that, given that that it, it has become such a Catholic's type of music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>It's become, it's become very straightjacketed in certain ways. Yeah. Yeah. It doesn't have to be. And there's certainly many, many artists who don't feel that they have to absolutely adhere to the, you know, this, this, this thing that ultimately maybe, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2169.045" data-end_ts="2169.245" title="2169.045" id=c_"2169.045">__you__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2169.245" data-end_ts="2169.365" title="2169.245" id=c_"2169.245">__know__</span>, maybe only really thought of just as a, an afterthought or a guideline with not meant to be, these are rigid rules. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2175.185" data-end_ts="2175.405" title="2175.185" id=c_"2175.185">__No__</span>.

I mean, even before I started doing my show, they, they were doing some interesting stuff. Like I've got, where it was was somewhere down south. They were doing a regular, like a monthly live, live streaming performance from this, this venue down there. Oh, wow. I can't remember what it was called, but, and it was like all over the map in terms of weird experimental stuff that definitely, some of it was very electronic, very, very beat oriented. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>And, and the strange thing that I started noticing is that a lot of people seem to have an interesting idea of what their definition of what ambient really means. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>I mean, for some, some people ambient means, you know, the ignorable background music, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2243.425" data-end_ts="2243.645" title="2243.425" id=c_"2243.425">__no__</span> bravery, soothing, relaxing sort of stuff. For some people, ambient seems to mean a, a a form of techno or a form of house, or a form of, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2251.925" data-end_ts="2252.085" title="2251.925" id=c_"2251.925">__when__</span> the, the, the dance, know various substructures there. I've heard people basically do, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2259.985" data-end_ts="2260.205" title="2259.985" id=c_"2259.985">__no__</span>, there's, I've heard heavy metal ambient, where basically all it is is it's, it's bog standard heavy metal, but they, they throw in a couple of spooky sounding synth pads under there, and suddenly it's ambient metal. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2271.875" data-end_ts="2272.165" title="2271.875" id=c_"2271.875">__Yeah__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's, well, it's, it's, and some of the edges are actually pretty interesting. I mean, you know, you take, you take sort of like that, that heavy jony basey stuff like <span style="color:red" data-ts="2282.325" data-end_ts="2282.525" title="2282.325" id=c_"2282.325">__Sno__</span> and some of these other people, I mean Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> that given, given, given squinted eyes. I mean, it sort of fits the genre if you allow it to be something besides yanis slowest songs. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>Exactly. I mean, it's, it's like rock, it's like classical, it's like jazz, it's like country and everything else. There's a million sub classifications that go 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Below it. Right. Myriad, myriad of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2306.365" data-end_ts="2306.605" title="2306.365" id=c_"2306.365">__John__</span> of sub genres. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>Right. Exactly. It goes absolutely fractal. I mean, it, it, it just breaks down and breaks down and breaks down and just keeps going. And to really say that it's just one thing, it's about as narrow-minded as you can really get. It's, for me, it's, I started finding myself, I was trying to break it down further and as to what ambient music meant to me personally. And like I said, for me, it was never something about relaxing. It was never something about soothing. It could be, I mean, I've heard a lot of people say that a lot of my releases, they found very releasing. My father used to say that he used to found a very, very relaxing to be able to listen to my stuff, which helped him. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. That's cool. Which to me <span style="color:red" data-ts="2348.125" data-end_ts="2348.345" title="2348.125" id=c_"2348.125">__is__</span> that's wonderful. I'm, I'm really happy to hear that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>Right. But it has to go with the understanding that was never really my intention. Right. It was not my goal to create the musical equivalent of Sox. Right. <laugh>, you know, and, I started finding it's like, this might not be the best descriptor for what I'm trying to do here. And Mm-Hmm. It started feeling more like, is it ambient music or is it atmospheric music? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I started thinking it's more like, it's atmospheric music and the music that I find myself liking the most. And the stuff that I'm working towards now, which is more of a progressive Hard rock me progressive metal kind of project that I'm currently working on, but I'm pulling over some of the atmospheric elements that I developed over time, doing the ambient stuff. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2396.005" data-end_ts="2396.225" title="2396.005" id=c_"2396.005">__You__</span> know, nothing goes to waste around here. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>And, the ID and I, I always wanted, I love hybrids. I've always loved musical hybrids, which which where you get the blend of various things together. Right. And the idea of trying to, I mean, like I said, I, I've heard ambient, you know, gen, you know, DJ ENT <span style="color:red" data-ts="2414.065" data-end_ts="2414.265" title="2414.065" id=c_"2414.065">__with__</span> the form of metal. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. It's not a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2416.155" data-end_ts="2416.505" title="2416.155" id=c_"2416.155">__monia__</span> of, you know, it's, it's a whole lot of, you know, down tune opened thumping, no palm muted notes. I love it. I myself. But, then there's ambient gent and it's basically, it's that, but they've got some eerie spooky synth pads or some very heavily reverbed queen guitar in there. And I was like, I kind of like the direction this is going, but it's kind of like, it's coming from one direction, a metal, a metal musician's direction. The idea of it, I'm like, okay, but how about I've kind of come through, come through a ringer here, <laugh>, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>Yeah. I've, know, I've done the ambient thing, I've done the progressive rock thing, I've done the metal thing, I've done the Hard Rock thing. I've, I've pretty much done so many different forms. I'm like, I wanna start bringing all of this together. I wanna start, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2459.845" data-end_ts="2460.065" title="2459.845" id=c_"2459.845">__you__</span> know, for, so for the current project I'm doing, I'm trying to, I guess for want of a better word, trying to fuse all the different things. Even, even maybe even some of the, some of the, the surf elements just in terms of some of the guitar tones that I like. Sure. And I've always loved, I'm trying to bring them all together in kind of a unification here. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>One of the things that's kind of interesting is that for a lot of artists who've got a varied background, you know, I, I have some of that. Right. One of the things that becomes a concern is that you start worrying that you're going to be inauthentic in whatever music that you're working on. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>True. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You know, that, you know, I can't let anyone see my, see my, my surf skirts when I'm trying to be a legit heavy metal player. Or I can't let my heavy metal show when I'm trying to be a teal guy. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>I, I think that's kind of where, where my, my, you know, deeply inbuilt, punk rocker kind of comes into play. Like, it's kind of like, you know what? I don't care if you don't 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Damn the torpedoes. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>Yeah. As a matter of fact, knowing full well that this is going to annoy the living hell out of you <laugh>. That's why I'm gonna do it. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>I mean, I've, I'd even done some things when I was doing the show on Still <span style="color:red" data-ts="2538.855" data-end_ts="2539.095" title="2538.855" id=c_"2538.855">__Stream__</span>. I, I did some experiments with, basically it was ambient metal. Well, you remember some of the stuff Mike and I were doing when I was out there in Colorado with ent death metal ideas. Yeah. It was great fun. You know, I, I just basically crank up all the distortion and the feedback, and I had my eight string guitar, and it was just like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2557.645" data-end_ts="2557.935" title="2557.645" id=c_"2557.645">__then__</span> looping it and throwing it through 16 million reverbs and delays and everything all synced up together. Do that for a while. And, you know, some of the people thought that was really cool, and some of the people ran screaming. Right. And it's like, well, you know what, this is what I'm doing here. And, you know, no. The old quote, you knew the job was dangerous when you took it. Well, when you, when you came in here during the show, you, you knew you had a 50 50 chance this could happen <laugh>. Sure. So, that never really bothered me. I mean, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I guess <span style="color:red" data-ts="2586.735" data-end_ts="2586.815" title="2586.735" id=c_"2586.735">__I__</span> Well, that's interesting because that, that element of risk, you know, I, I've often talked to people about, talked to people on the podcast about live performance and how one of the things I think is important for the audience is to experience the element of risk that Absolutely. That the performers are hopefully feeling, assuming they've got any to feel. You know, and it's where it's sort of like the completely pre-programmed set kind of lets you down, because there's not really any element of risk there. But it seems like when the element of risk includes everyone in the audience potentially hating what you're doing Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> <laugh>, there's, you know, you're kind of like taking it to an extreme point. No,

<p>

I, I've had, I've had shot glasses thrown at me <laugh> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2709.185" data-end_ts="2709.405" title="2709.185" id=c_"2709.185">__and__</span>, and, no, I've, I've, I've had, you know, people, I've had fist fights break out and right in front of what I was playing. You know, I've, I've been, you know, I've been in bands and have things thrown, I've heard things cold at us. I've, you know, I've seen knife fights happen, <laugh>, you know, it's, you, you either develop a thick skin and you think, okay, you know what? I'm going to commit to what means something to me as opposed to what's expected of me. And I kind of thrive on the idea of doing things that people may not expect of me. People who have known me for a long time. I mean, you know, musicians who I've played with for, for literally decades, they, they've kind of gotten used to the idea of, yeah, okay. <laugh>. Yeah. He, he's gonna be doing Prague Rock one minute, and then he's gonna be doing surf one minute, and after that he might be listening to Bossanova, and then he's gonna be listening to Gordon Lightfoot. And, you know, my wife and I have parties over here. We, we, we <span style="color:red" data-ts="2763.685" data-end_ts="2763.845" title="2763.685" id=c_"2763.685">__kinda__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2764.125" data-end_ts="2764.245" title="2764.125" id=c_"2764.125">__confused__</span> <laugh>, we confuse the living hell out of

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>People. I bet the DJing is crazy. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>Oh, my, my wife's taste in music is every bit as eclectic as mine, which is one of the main reasons I love her. Right. But people come over and it's like, okay, you might be hearing some thrash metal testament or mega <span style="color:red" data-ts="2779.085" data-end_ts="2779.285" title="2779.085" id=c_"2779.085">__death__</span>. One minute. You might be hearing Cuban sas <span style="color:red" data-ts="2781.205" data-end_ts="2781.365" title="2781.205" id=c_"2781.205">__on__</span> the next, you might hear, some surf, might hear some Gordon Lightfoot, who I'm also a huge fan of, <laugh>. You might hear some, some, you know, know some <span style="color:red" data-ts="2792.385" data-end_ts="2792.605" title="2792.385" id=c_"2792.385">__sh__</span> beam, some, some Brazilian bossanova, which I've always been, always loved, you know, it's, it's, you know, know, get ready to kind of flow with things. Right. Or get ready to be shocked out of your mind. <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Get ready to surf, surf the edges. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>Exactly. Yeah. I mean, it's, it's, it's always been something I've kind of thrived on. And, it's, it comes back to what you said at the very beginning. This is, this is supposed to be fun. And, and, and if it ceases to be fun, because you're, you're finding yourself being forced into, you know, a mold that people expect of you, of what they expect you to be playing and the kind of music to do, that that's gonna be coming out of you. You're either okay with that and you have no problems, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2836.065" data-end_ts="2836.285" title="2836.065" id=c_"2836.065">__no__</span>, you know, changing yourself, you know, catering to the whims of everybody else as opposed to what you wanna do, or you're gonna throw some of that back in your face. Sure. I mean, I think, and once again, Robert Fripp, I think he one time said something along the lines of, and I'm paraphrasing, there's a very close parallel between musicians and prostitutes in that they both tend to sell something very, very close and dear to them for way too cheaply. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>Right. And, and it's, it's a very valid point, you know, and, and sometimes people are willing to totally just upend and sacrifice whatever it is that they got into music in the first place, just for the sake of people to pay attention to them. It's like, well, people aren't paying attention to you doing what you like, then it's not up to you to change. It's up to you to find a better audience and, and maybe change whatever real or virtual venue that you're doing to get people to kind of appreciate it. You know, it's, no, I've, I've done, I've done one, I mean, aside from when, when you, and, and Mike and I did the performance out there in Colorado, I've done one actual in venue, live hobby <span style="color:red" data-ts="2897.385" data-end_ts="2897.605" title="2897.385" id=c_"2897.385">__and__</span> performance. One solo performance that I did, it was at a, a wine pasting room near here. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>It was actually was a place that my, the cover band I was in at the time used to play in as well. And I thought, Hey, this would be kind of fun. You know, this goes, so there's another, there's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2912.205" data-end_ts="2912.285" title="2912.205" id=c_"2912.205">__a__</span>, there was an experiment <span style="color:red" data-ts="2913.205" data-end_ts="2913.485" title="2913.205" id=c_"2913.205">__front__</span> with Hazard, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2913.985" data-end_ts="2914.205" title="2913.985" id=c_"2913.985">__you__</span> know, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2914.725" data-end_ts="2915.005" title="2914.725" id=c_"2914.725">__part__</span> it in, you know, the, the, the giant pedalboard that you've seen. And I brought along a rack full of stuff too, and I brought along my eight string guitar and the speakers all set up and everything. And you think, okay, now, you know, in terms of ambient music, this, this should be really perfect. It's a long tasting room. And then to add onto to that, I had a, a guy who actually worked at the wine tasting room who does live painting. So he was painting as I was doing, like oil painting as I was actually playing. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> kind of as he was basing on what he was hearing, kind of terms of imagery. So I thought, man, this is a win-win. People are gonna love this at this place, you know? Nah, not really. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh really? No, it was, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>Didn't go over. That's wild. Was it Did not go over at all? I mean, it was no, it was, it started out with a mediocre turnout and then people just kind of trickled out left. You know? It's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Unfortunate, but it's actually interesting because there again, it's, it's sort of like the risk riskiest. So when you're, when you're working like on still <span style="color:red" data-ts="2970.925" data-end_ts="2971.165" title="2970.925" id=c_"2970.925">__stream__</span> doing your streaming show Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> or doing radio work or whatever. I mean, you have your audience and they tune in because you are who you are. So there's a, there's actually quite a safety net built into that once you develop that audience 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>To a degree. But at the same time, I mean, you've also got a total variable situation going in where you never know who else is gonna be in there. And there's always a possibility. And I've seen it happen many times during the course of when I was doing the show, where you'll get somebody who just decides he's gonna come in <span style="color:red" data-ts="3000.745" data-end_ts="3000.965" title="3000.745" id=c_"3000.745">__to__</span> the chat room or whatever it is, and he's just going to freak out on everybody 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Wreck hauck. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>Yeah. I mean, there's one thing about being the fly <span style="color:red" data-ts="3007.805" data-end_ts="3007.925" title="3007.805" id=c_"3007.805">__in__</span> fly in the ointment, and then there's another thing that, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3009.825" data-end_ts="3010.045" title="3009.825" id=c_"3009.825">__you__</span> know, just being an asshole <laugh> to be blunt. Right? Right. And, and we, we've seen that happen and thankfully I had some people, you know, some, some very good friends of mine who were in the chat room at the same time, who, you know, if I was doing a performance and I had, you know, both hands on a guitar, my feet on the pedals, and I can't really turn around and hit the chat room and at the same time and try to do something to deal with it, I'd have other people in there who <span style="color:red" data-ts="3030.765" data-end_ts="3030.885" title="3030.765" id=c_"3030.765">__kind__</span>, who basically would have my back, got it. They would kind of, you know, get that back under control again. Sure. But now even in, even in that kind of supposedly controlled environment, it's not that controlled. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting when I hear your music Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. I really think of it in sort of visual slash cinematic kind of terms, right? I mean, I imagine interactions with Visualists or whatever Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But since you've done most of that personal work as part of the streaming show, have you found yourself in a position to work with many people outside of the musical arts? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>Not really in terms of direct interaction while I'm doing it. Uhhuh <affirmative>, that's, that said, it has really driven me to kind of taken on more visual, actual visual stuff myself. Case in point, that video that you saw, . Which the current 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. For the, for listeners, I will post a, a link where, where people can see the first gauntlet being thrown down on your new project. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>Right. That was kind of the other end of the spectrum for me, where I've know, like you said, it's, you're right. To me, it, it's absolutely a very visual medium. I mean, visual music <span style="color:red" data-ts="3099.225" data-end_ts="3099.445" title="3099.225" id=c_"3099.225">__in__</span>, in terms of atmosphere, like I said, atmospheric music to me is something that, it's music that paints a picture in your head, good, bad, or ugly, you know? Right. It's, and it's something, and as long as it's there, it's doing the right thing as far as I'm concerned. Sure. So I've always been very, very interested in that sort of thing. I lack the actual ability to sit down with a <span style="color:red" data-ts="3116.325" data-end_ts="3116.485" title="3116.325" id=c_"3116.325">__paint__</span> with a pen or a paint brush and actually draw or paint. My father <span style="color:red" data-ts="3120.905" data-end_ts="3121.125" title="3120.905" id=c_"3120.905">__was__</span>, was an outstanding, oil painter, and he, he had even had like, you know, his, his paintings done in, you know, various galleries around the country and, you know, he, he, I, he didn't pass that, that part of the genetic to me to be actually be able to do that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>But <span style="color:red" data-ts="3135.465" data-end_ts="3135.685" title="3135.465" id=c_"3135.465">__no__</span>, gimme the right software. <laugh>. Yeah. And, basically I, I became very, very interested over a number of years, in first starting off doing work with three D animation, which has, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3147.245" data-end_ts="3147.365" title="3147.245" id=c_"3147.245">__you__</span> know, kind of been something I've always been interested in, in general, graphic design, motion design, stuff like that. And little by little I started becoming more and more interested in visual effects, VFX compositing, green screen work, stuff like that. And it kind of boils down to what I said before about the ignor <span style="color:red" data-ts="3164.765" data-end_ts="3165.005" title="3164.765" id=c_"3164.765">__ability__</span> and that I'm just such a huge ham. And really what it comes down to is like, you know what I, this is a solo project and I'm gonna do the music. Well, I wanna do the videos too. Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3176.145" data-end_ts="3176.365" title="3176.145" id=c_"3176.145">__No__</span>. I have direct pictures in my head of what I want this to look with, and I don't wanna see it diluted and translated through somebody else's idea of what my music looks like. Right. Which may or may not be right. I mean, there's been too many times I've seen music, I've heard a song that I absolutely loved, and I'm sure everybody's been through this. You hear a song like, it, it puts like a mental movie into your head. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, anytime you hear it, it just kind of plays through the pictures of, of a story of some kind. And then you see the actual official video for it and you go, Ew. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>That was a let down <laugh>. And, so I was always kind of determined like, I'm, I'm gonna do this myself, <laugh>. So I put a lot of time and effort over the past number of years trying to develop that skill. And for better or worse, that's what know the, the end results of is, is of what you saw on that video there, which was I'd done, did all the video editing, the, the, the camera shooting, the three D modeling, the compositing, the green screen effects, all number of different things. And there's a lot of, you know, staying up till three o'clock in the morning kind of stuff going on there, month and months of that. And, it was one of those situations where when I finally saw the end results, I was, it was exactly what I mentally pictured going in tandem with the music that I had been <span style="color:red" data-ts="3256.045" data-end_ts="3256.165" title="3256.045" id=c_"3256.045">__writing__</span> I've been working on for this project for the past couple of years. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>And it made me feel okay, maybe I think maybe I'm, I'm on the right track here. Maybe I'm doing something right here. So that's kind of, I guess if this is kind of a good segue here to go into what the actual, my current project is. It's kind of, it's, it's a concept <span style="color:red" data-ts="3275.115" data-end_ts="3275.405" title="3275.115" id=c_"3275.115">__that__</span>, yeah, it's, it, it's a good old fashioned Prague rock sci-fi based, you <span style="color:red" data-ts="3280.085" data-end_ts="3280.165" title="3280.085" id=c_"3280.085">__know__</span>, sci-fi, story <span style="color:red" data-ts="3281.125" data-end_ts="3281.365" title="3281.125" id=c_"3281.125">__based__</span> concept album. It's a story that I've, I've basically have been writing in my head over the past four or five years maybe, and going with it all the visuals I kind of imagined too. And it was only over a certain number of years <span style="color:red" data-ts="3294.165" data-end_ts="3294.365" title="3294.165" id=c_"3294.165">__that__</span> I actually started developing the skills to actually make those visuals happen <span style="color:red" data-ts="3297.265" data-end_ts="3297.485" title="3297.265" id=c_"3297.265">__in__</span> tandem with the music. So I was like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3299.365" data-end_ts="3299.565" title="3299.365" id=c_"3299.365">__no__</span>, I'm gonna try to make this a combined project where there's the music and then there's gonna be visuals. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>But at the same time, I didn't wanna do, make an attempt at making a movie. You know what I mean? I didn't want it <span style="color:red" data-ts="3311.045" data-end_ts="3311.085" title="3311.045" id=c_"3311.045">__to__</span> be that linear, that linear is kind of along the same ideas of where I was saying with the music video being a disappointment, you know, when you had your own ideas of what, what that song should have looked like, you know, going no total, no synesthesia there, you know, that that song doesn't <span style="color:red" data-ts="3326.525" data-end_ts="3326.685" title="3326.525" id=c_"3326.525">__look__</span>, doesn't, doesn't look purple enough. <laugh>. Right, right. So, and it, it also kind of mapped into me for certain things where in terms of, I'm sure everybody's seen it where you, you've seen movie trailers or movie teasers where the teasers are just amazing and they get you really hyped up about this movie and know, and they put it out like you are in advance and you get all excited and your mind starts filling in the blanks Oh yeah. Of what you imagine this movie's gonna do and what the storyline's gonna be and where it's gonna look like and everything. And then you see the movie finally and Wow, what a let down. Right. You 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Know, it's, yeah. Video games do that a lot for me, the uhhuh the two year ahead of time video never really works out to be the game that I, I conjure up in my head. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>Exactly. I mean, it's, it's, and that started getting the gears turning for me. Where I started thinking is like, you know, I could try to make linear music videos, which is what everybody tries to do, where it's one song equals one story, or a whole bunch of stories for a concept sort of thing. But I started thinking <span style="color:red" data-ts="3390.845" data-end_ts="3391.085" title="3390.845" id=c_"3390.845">__this__</span>, like, I really like watching movie trailers. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and movie teasers and stuff like that, because I like that idea of the blanks Mm-Hmm. Being left open for the imagination to fill in. But rather than trying to eventually give them a finished product, the idea I started thinking was, is why not as far as the visual end of this project in terms of the videos and that, that end of the media, give it, give it in little pieces, literally treat the whole thing like a bunch of, you know, commercials for a TV series or, or trailers or teasers for a movie that never actually happens, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="3431.685" data-end_ts="3431.885" title="3431.685" id=c_"3431.685">__So__</span> the idea is that you're left with little bits and pieces, little, little not so subliminal suggestions. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3438.985" data-end_ts="3439.205" title="3438.985" id=c_"3438.985">__Now__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3439.205" data-end_ts="3439.405" title="3439.205" id=c_"3439.205">__if__</span> you saw on the video, it's, it's quick flashes of imagery. They're, they're very, very strong images, but they don't complete. Right. And, and, and the idea is let let the person themselves fill in the blanks, connect the dots, the themselves, and that way they can kind of build up their own idea where this is supposed to go and what this is supposed to look like, as opposed to trying to hand it to them and ultimately taking the chance of, well, they're gonna be disappointed in it. Well let, let them kind of fill in the blanks themselves. Sure. So that's kind of where I'm going, Matt, with this project. And, it seems to be coming together so far pretty well. The idea is that, rather than, 'cause <span style="color:red" data-ts="3479.245" data-end_ts="3479.365" title="3479.245" id=c_"3479.245">__I__</span>, I've, I've been working on this project for a number of years, and finally I decided, you know, if I try to actually wait until I get the whole thing done, it's literally gonna be the year 2063 before it actually <laugh> is. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>And and finally I was like, you know what, why don't I just kind of, and some other people was like, well, why don't you just put out a couple songs at a time? And <span style="color:red" data-ts="3499.205" data-end_ts="3499.285" title="3499.205" id=c_"3499.205">__he__</span> started thinking like that, that'll be an idea. You know, why not kind of go back to the old, the old mindset of, you know, singles versus out singles, right, yeah. Or eps. So I started thinking of it as like, you know, why not just release like four or five, three to five songs at a time? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and just make it like a multi part series. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3516.295" data-end_ts="3516.645" title="3516.295" id=c_"3516.295">__Right__</span>. So it's literally, the idea I'm thinking of is making this a se like a serial album. So it's going a series of eps for the <span style="color:red" data-ts="3523.965" data-end_ts="3524.045" title="3523.965" id=c_"3523.965">__thing__</span>. So it's gonna be part one, which I'm mostly finished with, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3527.085" data-end_ts="3527.245" title="3527.085" id=c_"3527.085">__what__</span> I'm hoping to have done by the end of this summer. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, I've already started putting together all, I've actually mapped out, like I said, I've mapped out the entire whole storyline, the whole story arc of this thing for years. So that's already in place. So now it's, and I've had most of the songs work worked on, so now it's just a matter of actually putting all the pieces together. Sure. And it's, it's kind of fun 'cause when you have something developing <span style="color:red" data-ts="3547.805" data-end_ts="3547.965" title="3547.805" id=c_"3547.805">__and__</span> you head that long and then you finally, it actually comes to fruition, it's, it's wow that, that's kind of like the way I imagined it turning out. Hopefully you hope that's the way it turns out sometimes it's like, oh no, that <laugh> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3560.715" data-end_ts="3561.005" title="3560.715" id=c_"3560.715">__that__</span> goes wrong. But, it's, it's kind of become what's been driving me more than anything else. And that was also another one of the factors why i, I left the radio show, was that I wanted to lock my focus down on doing this. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>And you know, it's when, when you spend, I, I put a a, a sizable amount of time, you know, as anybody should, if you're gonna commit to doing a ra a a weekly regular radio show, you, it's a commitment. Right. You need commit time to prepare and, you know, accept submissions from people's music and put together playlists and try to think of a, you know, a theme or a flow of all the various songs. You know, it's very easy just to grab a note, a folder full of songs and do, you know, shuffle play done. But I wanted to try to present something that wasn't just literally phoning home and phoning it in. And, I started realizing the amount of time I was putting into it was kind of slowing me down from being able to work as an artist myself. Right. And while it was great that I, and, and like I said, my main driving factor for the radio show was the idea that I wanted to get help these other musicians get their music heard. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>And it didn't help, didn't hurt that I got my own music heard too. Sure. But, you know, but I wanted to help promote some of these guys and some of these people's music who otherwise, you know, were just kind of sitting there and nobody was really catching them. I was very always very happy to hear it's like, yeah, I got turned onto to a couple of these guys on your show that I'd never heard before. And that was really the main driver for me. But after a while, if you do something like that long enough, you, if you are an artist yourself, you start, you <span style="color:red" data-ts="3656.165" data-end_ts="3656.285" title="3656.165" id=c_"3656.165">__know__</span>, thinking it's like I'm putting more time into promoting other people than my own my own music. And you have to kind of come to a conclusion or a decision at some point then and think, okay, I can continue doing this, which is good. I could continue promoting other people's music or I can try to focus on my own. And it kind of came to a balance point where it tipped and I finally said, I, I know, hopefully not to sound selfish, but I needed some, some time to focus back on me again. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Of the people that I've talked to the podcast, so people are builders and makers, some people are artists of different type. And, and you are one of the people who's been rather, you know, you're really prolific, but you're also very focused on actually producing, producing stuff. And so I'm curious to ask you, it's sort of a gear related question, but it's not really, not, not not at its heart. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>If you were going to be stranded on the, the ubiquitous desert island right where you were, all you were gonna have was time to create from now until eternity. What, what would you want with you? What would be the tools? 'cause you use, you use every tool from what I can tell. You know, you've got a background in keyboards, you play <span style="color:red" data-ts="3739.645" data-end_ts="3739.965" title="3739.645" id=c_"3739.645">__basic__</span> guitar, you've got chops on the Chapman stick, you have effects galore. You're a, you're a writer, you do video work and all, which is, I mean, it's an amazing amount of stuff. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. If you had to coalesce <span style="color:red" data-ts="3754.405" data-end_ts="3754.525" title="3754.405" id=c_"3754.405">__and__</span> if you had to do the Desert Island thing, what would you need to get your job? What would you need to make yourself <span style="color:red" data-ts="3760.845" data-end_ts="3761.165" title="3760.845" id=c_"3760.845">__happy__</span>, happy for the long run artistically? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>I, I guess the, well of course in the desert island situ situation, you're not really given very much of a choice. It's like the ship just sank and you're stuck with this. Now <span style="color:red" data-ts="3774.005" data-end_ts="3774.125" title="3774.005" id=c_"3774.005">__what__</span> are you gonna make the best of it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, we're assuming that there's like that, that there's like a, a power connector on this island <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>Okay. If that works for me. Sure. Absolutely. I, I guess I would <span style="color:red" data-ts="3789.835" data-end_ts="3790.035" title="3789.835" id=c_"3789.835">__try__</span>, if I had to least think in terms of a musical instrument that I would be able to say, you know, I could sit down and try to get as many different, I guess let's go back to the visual analogy again of that, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3805.335" data-end_ts="3805.535" title="3805.335" id=c_"3805.335">__the__</span>, the, if I had to choose one instrument that I would had to, that would be the only one I would be able to sit down with and be able to paint the most musical pictures with in terms of a, of a wide scope. It would probably have to be a piano. I would probably have to say, you know what, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3821.155" data-end_ts="3821.375" title="3821.155" id=c_"3821.155">__gi__</span> give me an acoustic piano. And I would just try to make the best of that because there's just so many things you can get out of those 88 keys or the 88 88 string guitar <laugh> Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>As I've heard it called. But, it's one of those things where you can be very, very quiet and very, very gentle. You can be thundering, you can be very percussive, you can be very legato, very flowing. You can be orchestral, you can be very minimal. You know, you can be downright bombastic and you could do something as, as, as with as much space as a Satya piece. And I would say that would probably be where I would go with that. I would probably say, no, I could probably just sit down. Well, it's also the fact that's also the instrument. I've, I've technically played the longest, but, it would probably be the one where I think I would probably be able to get the most out of, I could actually, you know, because I wouldn't, I wouldn't wanna lock myself down onto something where it's like, okay, this is a perfect instrument. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>If I wanna do nothing but ambient the rest of <span style="color:red" data-ts="3884.975" data-end_ts="3885.015" title="3884.975" id=c_"3884.975">__it__</span>. Right. Or this is the perfect instrument if I wanna do nothing but thrash metal the rest of my life. Well, I, I'm not really into just one thing at a time. I've, I've, my, my, if I have one mantra that I've always lived by in terms of music is there's too many different styles of music to just say, I like one. You know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3906.235" data-end_ts="3906.455" title="3906.235" id=c_"3906.235">__it__</span>, it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="3906.815" data-end_ts="3907.055" title="3906.815" id=c_"3906.815">__what__</span>? <span style="color:red" data-ts="3907.115" data-end_ts="3907.335" title="3907.115" id=c_"3907.115">__No__</span>. Why be boring? No, it's, I, I, I listen to a lot of different types of music and at the same time, I want to be able to create a lot of different types of music. And I would probably try to think what is the one instrument I could do the most with if I had <span style="color:red" data-ts="3920.885" data-end_ts="3921.005" title="3920.885" id=c_"3920.885">__to__</span>, had to really narrow down and limit my <span style="color:red" data-ts="3922.765" data-end_ts="3923.005" title="3922.765" id=c_"3922.765">__options__</span>. So it would probably, probably would be down to a piano as opposed to a guitar or a bass or anything else like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>Because it would, it would just give me the most, I think, the most sonic options and, and it would gimme the ability to be able to create the most varied terms of emotional output in terms of music. I mean, music is, is, if anything should be very, very emotional. Know it could be very stark and cold. And that's still an emotion in <span style="color:red" data-ts="3950.265" data-end_ts="3950.485" title="3950.265" id=c_"3950.265">__of__</span> itself. It doesn't have to be all <span style="color:red" data-ts="3951.685" data-end_ts="3951.805" title="3951.685" id=c_"3951.685">__in__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3951.805" data-end_ts="3951.885" title="3951.805" id=c_"3951.805">__the__</span> hearts and flowers. Right. But, you know, I, I need to be able to do something that would give me that much of a variance. And I think I, I would say probably the piano would probably be my best bet in <span style="color:red" data-ts="3962.725" data-end_ts="3962.885" title="3962.725" id=c_"3962.725">__the__</span> case if I had the choice. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting and awesome choice. Well, here, I, I want to thank you so much for the time that you spent talking to us. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>Thank you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Very much. It's really interesting to kind of talk to a thoughtful musician. You know, you, you've really, you've, you've put yourself in a position to actually have to be mindful about so many parts of what you do. And it's really, cool to be able to talk to you and, and have you verbalize 'em for us. I think a lot of artists struggle with some of these questions and, and your approach has been really interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>Well, thank you. And I, I've had a wonderful time and I, and I really appreciate, you know, inviting me on here. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright, well thanks a lot, a great time. Thank you. And, I will talk to you again soon. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>Okay. Take care, Darwin All right, man. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Har: </b>All righty, bye-Bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And there you have it. You <span style="color:red" data-ts="4016.045" data-end_ts="4016.165" title="4016.045" id=c_"4016.045">__got__</span> another podcast in the bag. Thanks a lot to <span style="color:red" data-ts="4019.165" data-end_ts="4019.365" title="4019.165" id=c_"4019.165">__hair__</span> for working with us on, getting this pulled together. Thank you so much for your listenership. Thanks for everything that you've done. For those of you who are, in the Midwest of the United States, please take the opportunity to see if, my visits in your neighborhood are gonna make sense. I'm going to be in Lincoln, Nebraska on August the first. We're going to be I'll, I'll have more details later. But, the fact of the matter is we're in a little maker space there. On Sunday we're going to be in Des Moines at the Des Moines Social Club. And on Monday we're going to be in Lawrence, Kansas. Still haven't had a spot. So if you're in Lawrence and can help us out, that's great. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Otherwise, for all I know, I might be just sitting in a bookstore, trying not to spend money. So <laugh> one way or the other, I hope that I get a chance to see you while on tour. And if not, keep in touch 'cause we're putting together more stuff in the near future. That's that tour is, myself and Mark Mosser doing, live improv with these postcard sized scores. It's pretty awesome. So I hope to see you there. Thanks for listening. SHare this with your friends, families, enemies, like I always say. And I'll see you next week. Bye.
