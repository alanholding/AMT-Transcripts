      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Okay. This week, I am very pleased to have someone who I consider a friend, someone I talk to every time we get a chance to talk to, it's Richard Devine Is that, is that how you see your name it's divine, right? It is because
        I have to say that like 50% of the people that I talked to say divine 50% say Levine. And so I just wanted to verify that </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Richard Devine: </b>I've heard all variations everything above, so it, but it all works for me.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Welcome Richard. Thanks a lot for being on the podcast with us. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>Glad to be here. Thank you for the interview.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Sure. With every podcast, I always kick it off, asking people to give us a little bit of their background. Why don't you share some of that with us? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>Well, let's see here. I guess my background, I've never went to any sort of proper school for music or sound design or, you know, the, I guess the earliest formal musical training I had was, I've had piano lessons. I going back
      at around age eight and, that was purely because my mom wanted me and my brother to do something other than, you know, ride BMX bikes and play in the Creek, every afternoon, which is, and in the beginning we weren't really that, that into,
      learning music or sight reading or any of that stuff, which was what I was, which my basic introduction was all that was classical music. And, that was basically, I would say that would be the starting point for me, where I was introduced to a
      composers like Eric <span style="color:red" data-ts="103.13" data-end_ts="103.76" title="103.13" id=c_"103.13">__Sati__</span>, WC, Haydn, Japan, and, Bach, having to learn these, you know, deeply complex, beautiful, pieces of music that all
      these, you know, different layers and movements and changes throughout each piece.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>It was basically the first basic found foundation, or I guess the basic foundations of music for me, where these were the first pieces of music that I had heard at that age, and had to play these pieces over and over for
      recitals and stuff. During that time. And it wasn't, I would say until when me and my brother got into skateboarding, when we started to get introduced to newer forms of music, like hip hop and thrash metal and punk early punk music, that's
      when our brains kind of got exploded into this whole different area, that kind of came along with skateboard culture. And, it was kind of cool because for me, it was sort of like this whole DIY aspect, a lot of these bands were just these
      garage, punk bands, you know, they're all that kind of form together, a group of friends and, and started making music.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>I love that idea, just kind of, the rawness of, of punk music and even hip hop in a way was, was kind of had this raw, you know, do it yourself bedroom sort of style approach <span style="color:red" data-ts="189.01"
        data-end_ts="189.37" title="189.01" id=c_"189.01">__than__</span> I was. I was just always intrigued by that. And, that you could just do that, all on your own. And, so yeah, that, I think going, you know, really, really far back to the
      beginning, those were like my initial, beginning points and, you know, along the way, I just, from those forms of music, I started to discover other forms of music, like early electronic music. on card noise, techno electro house, you name it.
      I, let's say you're going from that point. I started playing other instruments, drums, bass. And then, I actually in high school tried to start a few different bands with friends and it never worked out.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>I would always run into a situation where our drummer couldn't meet up for practice or our guitar player was fighting with his girlfriend and he couldn't meet up that afternoon. And it was constantly this battle just to try to,
      you know, to make music. Like I had friends that were really serious about wanting to make music and wanted to get together. Then I had friends that there were other things are more important. So I was like, you know what, I'm just going to buy
      a drum machine. Nice. And, so I started looking into buying other gear at that time. And, and at that same time, I started deejaying a bit about two turntables. And this is probably, I was 16 years old when I got my first set of techniques,
      turntables and, started buying records. And back in here in Atlanta, there wasn't really a, a big electronic music scene back in the day. There wasn't a whole lot of people that were making this music, I knew of one or two other producers in
      the area.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Well, when you say back in the day, what kind of timeframe are we talking about? Are we talking about the late nineties, early nineties, </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>Early nineties, or I'm going to say between 92 and 93 is when I started to buy a lot of this stuff and, and start researching this stuff more seriously. And, I'd say like 94 was really when I started to kind of seek out a lot of
      this stuff, because I basically just wanted to build up a studio where I could make my own music and, and, you know, have all these machines do what my band wasn't able to do, like the parts. And, and, but as I started discovering more
      electronic music and I started to go out to parties quite a bit too, during this period, I'm going to raves and I'm sure that word doesn't get used as much these days, but back in those days, you know, we would find out about parties and travel
      out of state quite a bit, you know, to be the Midwest or a lot of that, the early rave movement was happening and go to these parties where I'd hear Richie Hawtin play.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>And, Randy Garcia, a lot of these cool, Chicago producers, producers from Detroit, I was really heavily influenced by a lot of the music that was coming out, with those areas and like Detroit techno and the early electro scene
      Han Atkins and Drexciya and all those things that were coming on at that time were just such a huge influence on me. I'd never really heard music. I'd never heard anything quite like it, it wasn't like they were making music that was, you know,
      it was more music for your mind and your body that was just kind of taking you to a whole different place that, you know, all the other records that I've been buying, which were more, just kind of like cocktail music, kind of stuck in
      comparison, you know, you know, listening to, a lot of the it's specifically the Detroit techno stuff.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>Just love the cerebral dark kind of quality. You know, hearing Jeff Mills for the first time was such a huge, turning point for me. You know, I've been <span style="color:red" data-ts="440.94" data-end_ts="441.08" title="440.94"
        id=c_"440.94">__a__</span>, I'm still a diehard fan to this day, but I mean, just some of the things that he would do compositional and a track and some of the places that he would take you and him were just astounding to me, it was, you
      know, like listening to music that was 10,000 years into the future. And, you know, had this really stark sort of sinister sort of vibe and almost like, you know, psychotic synth patterns and textures that were just, you know, it just blew me
      away. I just never heard anything like it. And, that was, that was hugely influential for me. And then I'd say around, another Sam was the, it was the sound of acid, you know, the, the sound of the Roland TB three Oh three.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>And I had managed to get a few <span style="color:red" data-ts="489.77" data-end_ts="490.82" title="489.77" id=c_"489.77">__***<inaudible>***__</span> and by a lot of the early roll and equipment and was, you know, that was one
      of the first forms of music I ever started making was it was, was acid music or acid, techno, whatever people want to term it. And, you know, of course a lot of the Detroit producers were using those same machines and I was influenced by a lot
      of that early stuff, that first generation of, music that came out on plus eight records. And, there's just so much stuff. It was such a, an amazing time to be discovering all that. And, so I would, you know, Trump back from these parties. Oh,
      go ahead. Sorry.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Well, no, I just I'm channeling what you're saying, because, you brought up like, Juan Akans and Jeff Mills. I just remember, I remember the first time I heard Derek May's work. I couldn't stop listening to it. It was
        literally, there've been a few times in my life where I would hear something and all of a sudden the whole rest of the world had to stop while I'd listened to this thing for 30, for 30 times in a row. And it was, you kind of said something
        about it being music from 10,000 years in the future. And I think that they were channeling that a little bit, certainly Juan Atkins, you know, he had kind of this futurist vision, but, all of that stuff, it did, it just did seem, I mean,
        even more so than <span style="color:red" data-ts="572.55" data-end_ts="573.45" title="572.55" id=c_"572.55">__Kraftwerk__</span> to me, it just represented, a clear path for the future. And I think it's interesting that you, you kind of felt
        that same way about it. </i>
    </p>

    -----

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>Oh, definitely. You, you mentioned one, I can <span style="color:red" data-ts="585.41" data-end_ts="585.59" title="585.41" id=c_"585.41">__call__</span> the model 500 stuff and, you know, and I, of course, was listening to craft
      work and all, all of this stuff beforehand as well. And, but I just loved their take, you know, it's just like futuristic techno sound and, you know, I, you know, I just pictured like Detroit, this like crazy metropolis, like, you know,
      producers that were, you know, it, it just was a very mysterious instill is to this day, I, it has a mystique about it that, that I love that it's very alluring to outside producers who are not from that area. And, and you know, all of those
      guys, Juan Atkins, Kevin Saunderson, Derek may, I mean, they were, you know, just, I was blown away, just by that whole camp. And, and I still have all those records in my collection.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>Yeah. I hold on to them dearly. The Cybertron and all, I mean, just, there's just so many good records that they they'd put out. And, it just has like this nostalgic factor for me. And, and then I guess shortly after that, I,
      accidentally discovered the music of, of apex twin, which was kind of like a turning point for me in my career when <span style="color:red" data-ts="665.33" data-end_ts="665.54" title="665.33" id=c_"665.33">__I've__</span> coming from listening
      to all those different genres and music and deejaying in high school, I, was listening to quite a bit of industrial music as well. I was a big <span style="color:red" data-ts="676.4" data-end_ts="676.61" title="676.4"
        id=c_"676.4">__noise__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="676.64" data-end_ts="676.91" title="676.64" id=c_"676.64">__bot__</span> and fan skinny puppy, and a lot of the Canadian industrial music and front two 42. And, I was a big, check
      dangers and still am big Jack dangers beat manifesto fan, and we're buying the mindstream remixes <span style="color:red" data-ts="692.81" data-end_ts="693.38" title="692.81" id=c_"692.81">__EAP__</span>. And there was an apex twin remix on the
      <span style="color:red" data-ts="697.76" data-end_ts="698.06" title="697.76" id=c_"697.76">__EAP__</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>And I was just, I'd never heard of this guy before. I didn't know who he was. And I remember putting the, dropping the needle down on the record and being like, Whoa, this listen to this crazy syncopated percussion, and like
      the, the high hats and the, just, just all the entire track, the drones and the pad and the way he did just the way he did the arrangement just blew my mind. It was such a, it was so different from everything else that I was listening to at
      that time. And it had a very futuristic, modern sort of feel to it that I hadn't experienced before with, with like an electronic rhythmic track. And, it was just hugely, it just inspired me like nothing else at that point. And I was just like,
      I need to seek out everything that this guy puts out and re so I, I, it's funny cause I went and backtrack.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>I was like, Oh, it was, he runs a record label called reflex with this guy grant and they also put out other music that's very similar to this, that showcases other artists. I basically researched at that time and, started
      buying everything that they were putting out and just everything on the label blew me away where I made discoveries of Mike <span style="color:red" data-ts="778.33" data-end_ts="779.11" title="778.33" id=c_"778.33">__***<inaudible>***__</span>
      and, Luke fibered and <span style="color:red" data-ts="782.41" data-end_ts="783.25" title="782.41" id=c_"782.41">__Cylons__</span>, the, these artists were doing such and even to this day, there's still such forward thinking music. I, I was
      just blown away by <span style="color:red" data-ts="791.98" data-end_ts="792.04" title="791.98" id=c_"791.98">__I__</span>, and you look at that's where I heard Squarepusher and some of these other artists that were, each one had their own
      personality, in a way, but it was so forward thinking. Even at those times, the first few EPS that they were putting out on the label where just in my humble opinion were just like years ahead of everyone else.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>And, I was just so blown away by all that stuff. So I was like, wow, this is the music that I would love to make and be a part of this, this sort of world. And that, that kind of began my earliest sort of experiments into that
      realm. I was like trying to, I don't know, just, you know, that was the music that spoke to my brain the most and, you know, that's what I continued to, to start making. And that's the, still some of the stuff that I, I'm still inspired by to
      this day and continue to make, or try to make
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>What's interesting to me is that this track through sort of like your history of influencing artists, all kind of have one thing in common, which is that they would take either they would either work hard on coming up with
        very unique sounds and, and tambours, or they would take sounds that other people had sort of like dismissed as being too trite or too, non-realistic and sort of embrace that synthetic quality and, and ran with it, turned it into <span
          style="color:red" data-ts="893.18" data-end_ts="893.6" title="893.18" id=c_"893.18">__arc__</span>. Right. And I feel like if, if I, you know, if I would sort of wrap my arms around your work, I would say that that's very similar to what
        you do. You take, sometimes what we would now, frame as classic sounds, but twist them up a lot. You are also really active in sound design, kind of in a very unique way. You, you tend to, you know, things I've heard you do. Some of them are
        very aggressive. Some of them are very, are obvious to the point of being some non-violent you have a really real breath, but all of this stuff tends to be really focused on pretty fantastic sound design. It seems to me like there's more to
        that than just these influencing artists. Have you always been kind of fascinated with sound and sound creation? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>Oh, I would definitely say, I guess when I first got a digital sampler, I was doing a lot of my music compositions with an a Chi as 3000. And when I got the sampler, that was like a big turning point for me because before that
      time, I was synthesizing a lot of my sounds and using analog modulars and drum machines and things that, were pretty much fixed environments where you basically just, you know, you have what you had in front of you, and that was about it. You
      could run it through effects or run one device into another device to get different sounds. But, before that point I had no way of incorporating outside sounds into a music composition. And when I got the sampler <span style="color:red"
        data-ts="1005.49" data-end_ts="1005.58" title="1005.49" id=c_"1005.49">__that__</span> basically just opened the whole world up so I could record anything. And, and that's exactly what I did.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>I went out, recorded everything underneath the sun, just, it was such a, it was such a huge thing for me to be able to go outside and, you know, use my parents' garbage cans. His drum is the drums for my track, or, you know, go
      behind the Kroger grocery store and record one of the trash conveyor belt machines and, and use that in a music track. And the whole idea of just, you know, switching out what I would typically use for like a traditional analog drum machine and
      replacing all those drum sounds of all these weird found sound objects was, was huge for me. And it was interesting because at the time I got the sampler, I started to, study more of a garden music. I heard it a record collection from a friend
      of mine who, was a synthesizer here in Atlanta and he had this crazy, I think it was about four or five crates of records that I inherited from him.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>And this is where I discovered the works of Todd doc Staters and occas and Morton Subotnick in particular, which was another artist that I had no knowledge of prior to this time. And when I had gotten Sidewinder and wild wild
      boy, it just blew me away. I'd never heard music that was so organic and free. And, and I had no idea how he created it for coming from S you know, meet, listening to music that was so linear based. That was such a, so much on a grid. You know,
      using drum machines and, and, and hardware sequencers. It was like the polar opposite end of the spectrum. It was electronic, but it, the tampers and everything almost sounded like little organisms growing and multiplying. And, and then th the,
      the gestures were so free. It was almost like, you know, he was painting these, these particles onto a watercolor bleeding page that were where the colors were bleed into each other.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>And then, you know, it was, it, it just fascinated me. I was just so, so blown away by that. And I really started to kind of pay attention to sound more, not only within the synthesizers and how I was using the synthesizers, but
      also, you know, with outside found sounds how I could incorporate the sounds of nature or machinery, or ambiances into my recordings and try to use those more creatively, to come up with new things and, to kind of put the listener into these,
      different spaces. And, I just thought that was such a cool, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1179.18" data-end_ts="1179.32" title="1179.18" id=c_"1179.18">__it's__</span> such a cool thing.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Well, it seems like there's a bit of serendipity there too, to have, you know, have the background in synthesis to come in to sampling, but also then to fall into what amounts to a complete music education in four crates of
        albums sounds like a pretty amazing, bit of timing as well. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>Oh, it was, I mean, I was, you were ready for it. I was ready for it. I mean, I'm always the sponge. I always tell people that I love absorbing new music and knowledge. And, but I mean, when I heard Stockhausen for the first
      time or some of the John cage records that were in there, I, you know, I had no idea, it was basically the dumbest educational experience I could have had at that point in time. And it was really funny because it made me realize that the music
      that I was listening to at that point in time, which I thought was so advanced and futuristic, was actually not there. There wasn't a lot more futuristic ideas that had happened like 30, 40 years prior to that, where, you know, you have someone
      like John cage, you, you know, comes from this completely different approach and with such radical ideas about what sound is and how sound effects people like <span style="color:red" data-ts="1255.39" data-end_ts="1255.51" title="1255.39"
        id=c_"1255.39">__I__</span> just was, you know, I was just like, wow. You know, I, I, I obviously need to do a little bit more homework. Yeah.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>I have to admit though that John cage, if there's, if there's an argument to be made for time-travel Sean <span style="color:red" data-ts="1268.58" data-end_ts="1268.85" title="1268.58" id=c_"1268.58">__K__</span> just like
        right on the cover of that book, because he came up with, he, he came up with such drastic things and like over and over and over again, he would change things constantly and put the whole world on its ear. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>Oh, absolutely. I mean, you know, as far as like non-standard use of musical instruments, he's like the, the guy and, you know, I was already sort of toying around with those concepts, but, you know, I, I just didn't know that
      there was people before, you know, this time that were already taking these ideas to the most radical levels, you know, this sort of, the idea of playing with chance, you know, controlled means the toric approach of just these radical ideas
      that I'd been dreaming about. But then now after discovering John Cage's music and going back and listening to the variation series and all these incredible records, I was just, I was like, wow. I, I just, the thing that I need to take away
      from this is just to learn and to understand, and to find the wonderful things about this and, and hopefully try to incorporate some of these, these ideas into my own music and sort of, you know, fun, interesting ways.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>And, and, and, and it did all this stuff was so influential on, on my sound. I think for people who know about John cage and some of these artists, they, they understand they'll hear my music. And like, we understand rich you,
      we understand where you're coming from now. Whereas people who haven't studied, some of that stuff have a harder time understanding some of my stuff. They're kinda like, Oh, you just plugged a bunch of junk in and you hit record. You know, and
      I couldn't understand. I mean, people come from all different perspectives and backgrounds where, you know, they may have heard, or may have not heard some of these composers and some of their works. You know, I find that to even be more of a
      common thing lately with the newer generation of people getting into electronic music, you know, you mentioned some of these names and they don't know what you're talking about, you know, like, Oh, well, I know Skrillex, but, you know,
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>But you know, the, the flip side of it is, I wonder if I think that a good, trail of breadcrumbs is being left. The current generation talks about the previous generation, which talks about the previous generation, and if
        you're really into it and let's face it, not, you know, one out of every a hundred thousand Scrillex fans is going to become a serious, you know, serious about music study. But, the breadcrumbs are there, I think for people to follow it all
        the way back to Stockhausen. Right. We hope. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>Yeah.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>So now it's one of the things I would say about your work is that you do this. So, so you have these influences from sort of like the classic electro-acoustic world. You also have influences from Chicago and Detroit and, you
        know, and, and London schools, you tend to meld them in very, in a very interesting way. And I th and it's led to you getting a lot of opportunity to do sound design commercially. I am always curious about that as a gig. One of the things
        that in my podcasts, I've talked to people who've done album releases. And one of the things I always like to talk to people about is, when is an album released on, when do you feel like you're finished with it with a recording, and everybody
        has an interesting concept and how they can tell when they're done. I would think that sound design work. And especially if you're doing either sound design for a piece of hardware, or if you're doing sound design for like a sample library,
        how can you tell when you're done? How can you, how can you not say, you know, there's one more sound or conversely you say, wow, I have way more sounds. How can you tell when you've kind of completed, completed the job and produce something
        that's going to resonate with with other people? </i>

      <b>Richard: </b>That's a, that's a tough question to answer. Cause I struggled with that so many times with writing albums and, and working on music tracks that, you know, I've worked on some music tracks for months, you know, I think the
      longest I've ever worked on one track was like six or eight months somewhere around there where I was just, you know, going back and changing things and, you know, rechanging things again. And, it's funny. Cause when I first started making
      music, I made music with, with all hardware, right. And you basically, you basically just played through your track and you had to play it all in real time and, and hit record. So if you screwed up, you just had to rerecord the whole track
      again. But then an interesting thing happened when I started making music with computers, I could perfect things in, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1579.63" data-end_ts="1579.9" title="1579.63" id=c_"1579.63">__in__</span> actually perfect.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>Every second, like control what happens at like a specific point in time within the track where I could make some interesting transition happen or take the track into a whole different direction and with a whole different group
      of sounds or, but in doing that, you're constantly working on these pieces of music where you keep changing things, you adding things, you, you know, just because you can, and you can recall the piece anytime you want work on it at a later
      time, which I found some times tracks would come together really quickly, you know, like three or four days. And then I'd have tracks where I would struggle for months and months. And they would be these dragged out long, tedious processes that
      were just nerve wracking. And, so it, it's funny because with the technology, there's been points where I've spent too much time on a project where I, you know, I had all these great sounds and I could have probably added more.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>And the company I was working with, like, you know, Richard, we have to turn this in. We have, we have to release something and they've given me a hard deadline, to get everything in. So I would have to tell myself, okay, well
      I've only got X amount of time. That would basically be my end point for, you know, my cutoff point to turn in stuff. And, and that, that also went with record labels too. They would always give me a due date to turn in a remix or turn in an
      EAP or an album of songs. And, so, you know, I it's, I work better when I have deadlines. Cause if I didn't have them, I'd be, you know, endlessly tirelessly working on the tracks for an eternity. And, so it's good that I have those because I'm
      one of those people that will constantly keep changing or tweaking things or find a better sound here. I'm always one of those people that thinks that that can improve, you know, improve a piece. I think that's a better, better description that

      <b>Darwin: </b><i>No, what's interesting is that, I have had the, I in many people, but I've had the opportunity to see you play live, which is almost the exact opposite experience where sound design or Alvin creation can be, you know, can feed
        your obsessive nature when it exists a live performance is you putting it out there and, and letting it rip. How do you kind of balance your, your desire for sort of like specific sounds and specific, results in a recorded situation with
        doing live performance? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>Yeah. And that's, it's interesting because I'm actually trying to break out of my old computer bad habits. That's, it's this attachment to being able to change things and, and all that business. And when I was talking about this
      new sort of revolution, that's kind of come around again for me using modular since, that's kind of, I've been forcing myself to use them not only in the studio and not only just for sound design projects, but for live performances. And over
      the past two years, I've been, slowly sort of, kind of fine tweaking this live rig that I have, which is a enclave 12, you you're a wreck, case. And I keep switching modules in and out of it, but, of course
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>You do because that's what we do.

      <b>Richard: </b>It's just, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1804.03" data-end_ts="1804.36" title="1804.03" id=c_"1804.03">__it'll__</span>, that's another place that never ends either. And for, for me, the cool, the thing that I've been loving
      about the modular stuff is there's no attachment to anything you can't, you store anything you can't, even if you make patch notes of a particular patch, and reproduce that patch, you will never perform that patch the exactly the same way.
      Because there's so many different, there's just so many different factors that come into play that can change the way the patch sounds entirely in a split second, you know, one module could shift, the whole timing could shift the, the speed,
      the nuance of how, you know, like how far shifted in time. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1854.34" data-end_ts="1854.4" title="1854.34" id=c_"1854.34">__So__</span>, I mean, there's so many little things that can, they can affect what happens
      you can, you never can really, you know, you can't really grab onto the fact that you're ever going to get anything ever again, that one performance you do is, is the only one that's ever going to be like that in that moment in time. And I just
      love that idea. I love that. I, I can't fall into my old habits, you know, it's basically just live in the moment you're riding that fine line of absolute, horrible, brilliant performance. You know, it could go either way and it's all based.
      It's all based on what you're doing and what your brain is thinking at that split second. And it's such an exhilarating ballsy thing to do, I guess this is the best way to describe it. Cause you really don't have any fallback plan you don't.

      <b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Well, I often, I often think I I've been really influenced, in my performance stuff by my work with local dance company and, and one of the heads of the dance company, this guy named Jim <span style="color:red"

      potential for excitement. And, conversely, if you're set up, if your system, whatever system you're using to do a performance, if it has a lot of variables, risky variables, and you know, when you're working with dancers, it's all risk, right?
      Because dancers are risky people just period. But, if you have a lot of risky variables, the

    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>Absolutely. Yeah. It, and I'm completely agree with him in that, you know, that whole element of risk is what makes it so exciting, you know, because it's going to force you to do stuff that you wouldn't normally do and you're,
      you won't fall back on your, your old habits. And, and I was doing that a lot with my performances on the computer, towards the, towards the end where I was just, you're more or less just playing digital tracks and manipulating effects and re
      maybe re-sequencing stuff, but you're not really, you know, at least with my performances, I wasn't really taking, you know, huge risks. I was just perfecting the show. I had already set up and improving certain breakdowns or builds and stuff.
      And, and I still had fun doing them. I think they were really cool, but there was not that element of, Oh wow.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>Everything could just fall to pieces at any second. You, you, you have, you just don't have that feeling in the back of your mind. You know, everything's just right there in front of you, you can see, you know, you could, you
      could see all the tracks and you could change anything at any second and the computer, if something wasn't going the right way, or, you know, if you, the crowd wasn't feeling it, you could immediately pull yourself out of, out of <span

      of people. And wherever that <span style="color:red" data-ts="2062.72" data-end_ts="2062.9" title="2062.72" id=c_"2062.72">__bull__</span> takes you, you just have to kind of for a little while and, and hope that it, it turns out okay, and that

      comfortable with. It's, it's all an experiment in a way, and to see what you can get out, you know, I, I always make this, I've made this description in the past, but it's almost like when you create a really cold patch, it's like you have
      this, this just really interesting sort of, it's like, you've captured this electrical sort of little ghost, this, this little electrical spirit. That's just kind of living for that one second within this, this interconnected patch network of
      cables, that's sort of floating between all these different modules. And it's just kind of how you channel in, in shape that little electrical organism that's floating and record that little organism, is how I look at these like little modular
      pieces and patches.

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>I think it's just such a fascinating organic way of making music. It's, it's kind of like, you know, making music with nature, you know, one of the most basic elements and, seeing what happens cause it's, you know, it just
      fascinates me to no end. And, I've been finding that, taking that idea to a, like a live setting is, is really exciting and it's it, you know, there's been some great shows and there's been some horrible shows, but it <span style="color:red"
        data-ts="2174.61" data-end_ts="2174.75" title="2174.61" id=c_"2174.61">__has__</span> been lots of really cool discoveries and, you know, making lots of improvements with every performance. And, and it's just been a great, it's just been a
      great, journey so far. And, you know, I'm going to continue to keep playing with a modular system, you know, at this point in time and just see where it goes and I don't even know where it's going to go, but sure.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Well, when I, you know, the last, couple of times I've seen you perform, it was still when you were doing primary, primarily laptop and manipulation of digital tracks on the laptop. And, you had, you know, you had
      some very, particular things that I think where you're performing style. Some of it was a lot of interaction with the crowd, which is kind of rare for the laptop crew, because most of them had their nose planted on the, the number six key on
      their keyboard and you'd never see their face at all. Right. But additionally, you did a lot of like digital freeze manipulation, so like that you were one of the first people I saw that really did a lot of that in performance. It was really
      exciting. Have you brought any of that with you into the, into the modular? Do you still like have a computer with you that you're using for effects or is everything purely hardware now?
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>No. Y completely all hardware based. I had made sure that, I really wanted to be anti computer. I know that sounds funny because a lot of people that know me were like, rich, you've been doing computer performances for a decade
      to hear you say no computer. It's just, you know, we, we, they found that shocking. And, it's funny cause a lot of the videos that I've been posting up on my Vimeo channel of some of my modular patches, I actually put a little note in there
      saying that the patch was 100% made with the modular, no computers that drum machines were involved in making the band. I'm trying to let people know that, you know, I'm, I'm trying to make it a different move and see what happens without the
      computer and not be attached to using it, even though it's an extremely powerful machine.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>And, you know, you could pretty much do anything you want with it. Really trying to focus in and explore all of the options and possibilities of using just a modular synthesizer. And you know, there's lots of challenges to it.
      And, and I'm trying to find, you know, like you were mentioning in my computer performances where I would use, you know, specific plugins and controllers, whether that be like a lemur or, or a keyboard controller, I use so many different ones
      over the years. And you know, I think you might've been referring to. I used, I used a lot of the GRM plugins. I was a big fan of the GRM and, and you know, I use a lot of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_%2774">Cycling
        '74</a> stuff, plug and max and reactor. And there was just, you know, everything that I could get my hands on, I'll be using in a show.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>And, and with the modular stuff, I'm, I'm taking that same approach. I'm trying to find all the most interesting processing and sound generation modules and put them into a configuration that would make a really fun,
      spontaneous, performance that would sonically be similar to what I might be, might have done in my laptop performances, but using analog circuitry and some digital oscillators and controllers. This is sort of like Frankenstein, you know,
      mishmash of different modules to kind of make this sort of strange new incarnation of what I was doing digitally with the laptop. And, it's funny. I had a lot of friends message me and it's like, they, they make this comment. They're like rich.
      We find it really funny that you're making, you know, music with these analog, modular, systems that sounds like the music you made with the computer in 2001.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Right. Well, I was, I was just gonna say that, I think your approach is interesting because, so often when I see people take their first dive into a modular system, you know, they'll get a, or they'll get a, make
      noise, a DPO and a maths and, they'll hook it up and they'll do the thing that kind of sounds like a, an FM patch in a blender. And, it sounds, or, or they'll get, you know, three oscillators in a latter filter and they'll sound like cantering
      dreamed from four decades ago. And in both cases, what you see is that is that they become consumed with doing the things that the module does rather than doing the music that they, that represented their voice. And it seems like you're taking
      a different approach that is specifically about maintaining your voice and finding the module tools that make it happen.
    </p>

    -----

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>Absolutely. That is, I think that's key. I've, I've actually to a lot of people that were, you know, whether they were doing sound design or working to become an electronic musician, I think that it's extremely important to have
      your own voice and your own sound that you can identify with and that other people can identify with. You know, it, you know, I know my sound, isn't the, the next big thing or, you know, the hippest thing in the world. There's, there's a lot of
      criticism that comes with the kind of stuff that I was creating in the hole. I, you know, the IDM experimental electronic scene. But I mean, it's the music that spoke to me. That's the stuff I love. You know, it's the stuff that I continue to
      make and I'm trying to make, you know, the newest incarnations of that, that musical style that's influenced me so much, that I still, I still find to be fresh and interesting even in today's, standards and, you know, and even with the modular
      stuff, I, I tried to convey my own voice and my own style and approach.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>And it's funny, I've gotten lots of comments of people. So that's like rich, even when you do stuff on the modular, it sounds like you it's mistakenly your, you know, your sound, how they just find that really interesting that
      somehow I'm able to get that out of those machines. And, but I think that's, that's what I, I feel that's what an artist should do. I think they, it should just be an extension of their personality and what they're trying to convey
      artistically, you know, it's just like an artist with a paintbrush and I see no different that the modular or the computer or any instrument it should, it should just be an extension of you and you should, it should just be a channeling device,
      of, of some sorts that just kind of channels your emotions and your artistic sort of, creativity.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>And, that's, that's always how I've looked at all these tools and all this equipment, you know, gear like even a drum machine or just like a, you know, like a synthesizer. I, I still, even at that point when I'm designing sounds
      for like a keyboard, I always try to put my own personal sort of, touch on those sounds or, you know, they, they, they will all have some sort of edgy interesting sort of Tamberlin changing quality to them. The, you know, I try to put always a
      little spin on things to kind of give it that, just give it that little, you know, that little extra something that says, Hey, this is Richard, you know? And, I don't know. I find that to be hugely, you know, hugely important as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>I think, I think it's important because it's, it w it's what separates your work from just like archive work. I mean, the fact is, I've run across your patches on so many things. And so often I'm drawn to work. You
      do, because
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>It does, it often has either an idiosyncratic like performance characteristic, or like, you know, if you play it at just the right release time, then all of a sudden it blooms in a way that's completely unexpected. I think I
        tend to think of your work as having that, even when it is something like, your work on the way out where a Timewarp 2,600, which is one of the places where I, I remember being just, just entranced by your, your sound design work. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>Oh, wow. Well, thank you. That's all the years of owning an ARP 2,608. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2709.35" data-end_ts="2709.56" title="2709.35" id=c_"2709.35">__That__</span> one time by 2,600 actually here. I love it.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Let's talk about some of the practicalities of working with modular systems, because I know from going to synth meet ups and different, different people I interact with, they'll they'll know that I work with the modular or
        they'll see me work on the modular. And so often questions come up and it's that they can't imagine, first of all, you not being able to reproduce something later. You know, I tell them literally when I turned the power off, if I turned it on
        again, it's not gonna not gonna sound the same, or it's not going to have the same timing characteristics, or if I accidentally bumping up, the whole thing goes in a toilet. When you have the responsibility of getting in front of a crowd and
        doing a performance, first of all, do you S do you preset up your modular or do you start with a blank slate? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>That's interesting that you bring that up because just, recently at the Nam show, last weekend I did a couple of performances on a modular, and I used to actually this summer, I was traveling around playing shows with them with,
      with my case, and I would travel with the patch, you know, I travel pre patch, so, right. And it was basically, I would do that only if I knew that I was going to be arriving at a venue or would be having a lot of time to set up stuff. So I
      would try to pre patch as much as I could ahead of time and then finish patching during a soundcheck there. But recently I've been trying to take a different approach where, my show last Friday night in Los Angeles, I actually showed up with
      nothing patched. I had no plan what I was going to do, and it was kind of scary cause everybody else was of course, totally prepared.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>They had spent, you know, I had friends that were, they had spent all week on their show, at another friend of mine who showed up, who had pre patched his entire patch and I've been practicing it all week. Another guy that was
      there who, also had pre patched and, but was using a computer. So it was leaning more on the computer for his performance, less on the modular. And I w I basically was standing there setting up with all the guys, and I'll never forget the look
      on my friend's face when they saw me up in my case <span style="color:red" data-ts="2862.94" data-end_ts="2863.06" title="2862.94" id=c_"2862.94">__up__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2863.06" data-end_ts="2863.14" title="2863.06"
        id=c_"2863.06">__there__</span>, like, you don't have anything pre patched. I'm like, no, I'm actually going to just see what I can patch up right now. And, I'm going to try something different tonight and see, you know, basically whatever I
      patch right now will basically be what my performance is tonight.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>And thankfully the show went very well and it was very spontaneous and kind of, you know, totally last minute, nothing planned, I kind of was like, I'd spent probably 45 minutes, setting up the patch all in headphones. I didn't
      even do a level checkers or a line check. I basically, you know, set up stuff as good as I could in the headphones. And then when it was time for me to play, I just basically brought up the volume and just said, okay, here goes, it could be
      bad. It could be, I don't know what it's, what's going to happen here. And, but it worked out really cool. In comparison to my patches, that I was, you know, that I had practiced through and pre patched. I found I had more fun with <span
        style="color:red" data-ts="2928.46" data-end_ts="2928.64" title="2928.46" id=c_"2928.46">__it__</span> with this performance where I didn't have really any plan of what was going to happen.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>I just kind of interacted with the crowd and kind of, you know, just use the energy that was in the room to kind of, you know, force the changes and the evolution of what was going to happen. Whereas when I pre patched, I kind
      of had like this pre-setup set of, events that I had in my head that would happen at certain times and would evolve over time. And, and I did that a couple of times over the summer and the, and that approach worked really well, too. But I seen
      realized that even pre-planning a patch like that and pre patching it, and then going through the notions and changes in your head, you still will never perform it perfectly. It will still be it. Sometimes I would perform the same patch and I
      had friends that went and saw me play a show at one <span style="color:red" data-ts="2983.46" data-end_ts="2983.71" title="2983.46" id=c_"2983.46">__sent__</span> me, saw me perform the exact same patch.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>Another sends me they're like rich, that patch was so sick. It was totally dynamic <span style="color:red" data-ts="2990.35" data-end_ts="2990.56" title="2990.35" id=c_"2990.35">__grease__</span>. It's like, wow, it was the same
      patch, but there's so many things that will, you know, influence or change the way that you perform it. And, like you said, one knob could, you know, one knob accidentally being nudged the wrong way will shift the whole thing into a whole
      different direction and change the sound completely. Right. And, you know, because of that, the nature of the environment that you're working with, that you could just, I start, I'm starting now more and more to let go of the idea of like the
      pre patched come up with the, you know, pre pre pre performed something I'm liking the idea of just patching from scratch, with a loose idea of what you want to do, and then just kind of make everything happen and work with the energy of the
      crowd, and focus more on that then, you know, the performance and the tools that you have right there, and then it make it all happen rather than trying to play a patch perfectly all the way through that you have in your mind.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Sure. So when you're, when you're creating patches on the modular, do you tend to think of them in like little sub units or do you tend to think of like a signal flow from front to back as it kind of winds its way through the
        modular system? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>I would say, the second half, I think more about the signal flow of things. I have more of the classic approach from just, you know, I've been using, I, I would say I was like the first generation of, of using the modular stuff.
      They, you know, I had the EML, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3087.43" data-end_ts="3088.24" title="3087.43" id=c_"3087.43">__one-on-one__</span> the AKF Synthi and the ARP 2,600, the 2,500, the, the first time the analog revolution sort of
      came around when people were starting to buy this stuff. I started buying a lot of that, a lot of the early stuff. And, you know, some of the semi modules since like the, in particular, the 2,600, which was a hugely influential synth for me, I
      always just kind of looked at the signal flow from left to, right. You know, you start off with your noise sources, your filters, your envelope, generators, and your VCAs at the end.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>And, I still kind of keep that sort of classic signal flow, you know, sort of idealism when I approach my system. Like I put my sound, I couldn't, I configure my sound sources and my signal generators and all that stuff in a
      very similar fashion. You know, we're, if anyone were to look at my S my performance system, a lot of the clock generators and, EEG generators and all that stuff, stuff that shaping and clocking and pulsing the sounds, I keep those on the
      edges, the left and right side edges of the case where I can tweak them really quickly. And then all the sound generation tweaking stuff, I kind of situate towards the middle of the case. And then, you know, I typically will put my mixers over
      to the right as like the, the, the final output of everything being mixed into, into a system or into a digital recorder. And, so I, I, I still get kinda situate things in like a, more of a classical classical way. And, I think that that still
      carries through, you know, even today, even with my more modern Eurorack setup.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Sure. That's because of practice, that's the way your brain works. That makes sense. So, one of the things I remember from your performances, and certainly from listening to your releases is that you spend a lot of time, like
        tweaking affects. What do you use with, with the rig like this? What do you use for effects processes, </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>For, are we referring to effects processors in the studio or in like, outside for show
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Either, or just mostly when you're working with the modular, how do you, how do you affect it since you're kind of going in the direction of the anti computer, particularly, I guess we're talking live, but even, even when
        you're just playing with ideas in your studio, what, how do you keep that same approach when you're working with effects? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>Well, it's interesting. I use a host of different processing modules and, that, let's see here. Let me think about my case, the way I have it set up. And that's a combination of, I like using recorders. Like I use the mod can CV
      recorder and the phono gene by make noise. And, I love using stuff where I can record a piece of audio, you know, pitch manipulated granulated, chop it up, record CV too, as well, CV and audio with the CB record, the mod cat, it's really fun.
      Cause I can record up to four minutes of audio or two channels of audio and I can record two channels, a CV, and play that back and see <span style="color:red" data-ts="3291.02" data-end_ts="3291.14" title="3291.02" id=c_"3291.02">__be__</span>
      control that. So you could get all kinds of strange audio iterations and, and fluctuations with, with stuff that's going into that module.
    </p>

    -----

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>And I also use some of the Mongo stuff, the DEO, which is a dual delay line module, which is really fun, super precise. I'm using that with a, a macro machines expander, which is able to store different States of that module.
      And you're able to see be controlled through those different stored States and then manipulate the, the a and B delay lines, which gets into all kinds of crazy Karplus strong synthesis type sounds and really crazy sort of, self oscillating
      feedback type sort of sounds. I've been running a lot of my percussion stuff through that to do delay processing. And so I use that and the synthesis, technology, mini with the re sampling <span style="color:red" data-ts="3352.76"
        data-end_ts="3352.94" title="3352.76" id=c_"3352.76">__many__</span> delay, quite a bit. And, I'm trying to think what else, Oh, would the echo phone, Tom Herb's stuff and the, and if I'm, I try to do a lot of that fun stuff within the, the
      case, you know, I have those, those, affects modules that I send a lot of the audio into.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>And then I have a couple of pedals that I use as well. Because I w I had played around with the idea of using the laptop as an effects processor at some point, but then I was like, you know what, I don't want the, I don't want
      the audience to confuse because I've had such a close connection doing laptop performances. I don't want them to, you know, to misinterpret what I'm doing and like, Oh, he's, he's in the laptop more than he's using the modular, you know, and I
      was like, you know what? I've never was a really big pedal person, but maybe it's now time to start looking at using, effects, pedals and the setup. And, I've been having a lot of fun with that. I've used the Straumann big sky in the, blue
      reverb, the smaller one, and the timeline delay pedal, and, and quite a few of the even tide pedals space, which I actually worked doing some of the sound patches for some, a great pedal.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>And I'm really digging the, red Panda particle granular pedal, which is a small little white pedal that does granular chopping and slicing and pitching. And it's got several <span style="color:red" data-ts="3447.97"
        data-end_ts="3448.35" title="3447.97" id=c_"3447.97">__cold__</span>, different modes that add lots of interesting extra sort of granulating gestures to the signal. And, what, the fun thing that I like to do is I'm running an intelligent muda
      mix or mutagen mixer that allows you to switch, you know, which output you want. You have an AB and C, and you have these switches where you can just send that signal to wherever you want. So I route three different pedals, and then I basically
      play the switches. So the signals will go through different one. It may get one, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3482.89" data-end_ts="3483.13" title="3482.89" id=c_"3482.89">__be__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3483.4"
        data-end_ts="3483.94" title="3483.4" id=c_"3483.4">__process__</span> in more of a granular fashion. One might be thrown into different, you know, different reverb. One might go through a different delay and that in conjunction with using all
      of the, your Iraq delays and, and pitch shifting that I've already going on, in my case, it gets pretty crazy pretty quickly. And, and it's just so much fun, cause you're constantly just playing switches and tweaking knobs and stuff and finding
      these cool little pockets and really interesting little texture spaces as I call them that are kind of fun to play with. And, yeah, I love it. There's, it's, it's, it's been a lot of fun and you have a lot of room to, to kind of drastically,
      you know, change the, the texture of everything really quickly with all that stuff, even though it's not a computer.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Right. Well, that's, that's interesting that, how you're actually playing, how you've integrated the modular modular, or the effects into the modular, even in the case of using pedals, it sounds, it's like it's still getting
        patched into the modular systems so that you can control it from within that environment. That sounds really cool. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>Yeah. Oh, it's, it is fun. It's a lot of fun. And, I think that, you know, there's, like I said, there's not much you, you have in the way of like storing everything, that's all separated out, but it makes room for a lot more
      improvising. You just kinda, you just kinda go with the flow of things and use what you have in front of you and, and just kind of coasted out.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Right. Well, I also, I have a great story about the, the whole thing with, with having people watch you use the laptop and making assumptions. I did a show I'd written this piece. And I did a show where I was using the laptop
        is the effects processor, but I was in real time patching a large format modular. So I'm just like chunk, chunk, chunk plugging stuff in and going. And, a couple of times there was this one time in particular, I had just the right little FM
        ratio and, just the right little quantized noise sequence. And it just made this beautiful little meandering melody. Right. It was just magical. And when I was done, I had a number of people come up and they all kind of like pointed to this
        one point in the performance where it just went like really beautifully perfect. And they were like, so I know that was prerecorded. What else in your performance was prerecorded? And I just wanted to cry. I was like, man, didn't you see the
        big pools of sweat under my arms as I was trying to patch this stuff together. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>Crazy.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>But yeah, I think it's, I think you're really being savvy about making sure that the people that are watching you play understand what's going on. I think that that's a, that's a really important part of performance and it's
        something you've always been really, particularly good at. I felt. So it's, I've used up an awful lot of your time already and, I'm going to try and wrap it up, but I would like just ask you, you know, it'll probably be an unfortunate
        question, which is cast out 10 or 20 years from now, where do you see things going? I mean, you're, you're sort of tapped into the music industry and the <span style="color:red" data-ts="3690.07" data-end_ts="3690.4" title="3690.07"
          id=c_"3690.07">__EMI__</span> developments and stuff. If you had to imagine what things are gonna look like in 10 or 20 years, what do you, what shape do you think that they have? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>You know, it's, it's an interesting question. I, I'm not, you know, it's, I think right now, like I think with a lot of people, they were on the same journey. I was where we're doing everything in the computer and, and we're
      going kind of back to our roots. Again, we want to play with knobs and play with keys and faders and stuff. I don't know if we're going to ever, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3724.84" data-end_ts="3725.14" title="3724.84"
        id=c_"3724.84">__weren't__</span> going to ever really get away from that physical, that physical connection with an instrument where you actually have to touch and play something. And, you know, there was, there was still a good deal of time
      where we were using these touch screen controllers. I mean, I know I've been using the iPad a lot lately and there's a lot of great stuff and fun things are coming out, but I think even more so lately, people are going back to this physical
      aspect of things and the physical connection of playing with an instrument and tweaking things.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>And, I don't know if we'll ever lose that. I think the things that'll happen is we'll get more advanced processing, engines and tools behind those interfaces that will do more complicated things. You may see some variations and
      controllers and new things coming out that, you know, might be some, I mean, who knows, who knows, you know, years down the road, what someone will come up with and where the shift will change. But I think, I think people are still gonna want
      to play and plug stuff in and tweak knobs and, and those sorts of things. I think that, you know, the things that we'll see is just the microprocessor get, get much more powerful and smaller, so that we'll be able to do more advanced synthesis
      and processing these, these hybrid digital control modules that control analog circuitry, you'll be able to do much more complicated things, but I think that the interface will still be just as fun.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>Cause I think it's, I don't know if I would change that much. At this point in time, I think things are already in a really interesting, they're heading in a really interesting direction and that, you know, the, the only place
      that we could really go is just, we're more advanced processing, you know, doing more complicated synthesis and, and you know, sort of like higher audio bandwidth, you know, 24 and 96. I know some of the modules are already at 24 96 now, some
      of the digital oscillators, so we're already getting to the higher, into the higher bandwidth of, audio. But I think that as we progress, the computing technology is going to be shrinking and shrinking and, and, and, and end up in some of the
      hardware, you know, now we're going to have all these, you know, I'm using this nebulae module that you can run C sound, score files off the card now, as in your module. I think that's crazy. I never would've, you know, I never would have
      foreseen
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_02: </b>That. And,
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>But I think we're going to see a lot more of that. I think, you know, you know, 10 years from now, that's, you know, we're going to just see some extremely sophisticated digitally, these little digital playground modules that
      will do really sophisticated things, but the it'll still be a fun playground. I think that there, the playground aspect, I always say that the CV playground where you can play in plug things in and control things with CV that that's always
      going to be there. I just, I just think it'll get crazier. What you're controlling will be. So
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_02: </b>Yeah, that actually makes a lot of sense. And I
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Do think that you, that you hit something really strong in the head, which is that, the use of knobs and cables and CV control and all this stuff has brought an aspect of play back into the game. And now you're seeing
        companies like rolling and particularly <span style="color:red" data-ts="3936.1" data-end_ts="3936.49" title="3936.1" id=c_"3936.1">__core__</span> with the Volcker series and stuff, really embracing that the enjoyment of playing as much as
        the sound design aspects of it. And, it's a pretty amazing, and to me, enjoyable direction. So Richard, thank you so much for your time. This was a fabulous interview and, it was great to get a chance to talk to you again. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>Oh, absolutely. Well, I mean, like I said, thank you so much for featuring me. I'm honored to be talking with you again and we've known each other for a week. Go back. We go back.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>No, I think, I think the first time I actually talked to you on the phone was when we were two knuckleheads on the analog heaven list. And I was selling, I was selling an Oberheim that you were interested in buying and we
        could never come up with a deal, but we talked for hours back then. Yeah, </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Richard: </b>Definitely. It's so cool to that. We still remain friends
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>To keep, keep that connection. Yeah. Well, thanks again so much. It was fantastic talking to you and have a great day. You too. Thanks. Bye.</i>
