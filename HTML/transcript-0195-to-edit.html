<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, today I have an opportunity to get to know somebody new. His name's Mark <span style="color:red" data-ts="16.315" data-end_ts="16.605" title="16.315" id=c_"16.315">__Belo__</span>, and this is kind of a result of a funny little set of dominoes tipping over. I had two people scheduled to interview this week, and both of them kind of bagged on me. And so at the last minute, I put up on Facebook help. Who should I interview and make <span style="color:red" data-ts="33.485" data-end_ts="33.845" title="33.485" id=c_"33.485">__Schelle__</span> pointed me and Mark. And so I did a quick peek on his website, and I, I all of a sudden was quite intrigued. So, with that, I reached out. He was into doing a quick turnaround interview. So with that, we'll say hello to Mark. Hey, mark. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark Ballora: </b>Hi, Darwin. Nice to be here. I'm glad to be a pinch hitter for you today. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and frankly, I wish I would've thought to reach out to you sooner because your, some of your research work especially is some areas that are really interesting to me. Why don't we start off and have you, tell people what you do for a gig and, what some of your focus is <laugh>? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Well, my gig is a professor of music technology, and that's at, Penn State University. So I, I teach the, the standard basics in music technology, how to work with a digital audio workstation, musical acoustics, history of electroacoustic music, some programming classes in max MSP and Super Collider. When I'm not teaching, I, will compose, although the, the composing work has, has, drifted into kind of a niche area of, of sound work of, sonifying data sets. Like most of the time when I look at my friend's bios, they, they list, all these distinguished musicians and recording artists and people like that, that they've worked with. And I get jealous, but then I realize, you know, I've worked with some world renowned scientists, and that's, that's what I do. That's, that's what makes me different from everybody else, I suppose, is that I, I enjoy collaborating with scientists and turning their data sets into sound. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>I like to think of it as, as musical sound, although it should be informative musical sound. If I do it properly, it will provide a, a, a different modality for studying a dataset by creating a graph that is, is done with sound instead of, that is done for the eyes with shapes and the color and right sizes and so forth. And so it's, to me, that's, that's quite interesting as a composer to, to work with scientists and to see if I can help them communicate or understand their, their data better. And of course, it also raises interesting questions about why do we have ears as well as eyes? There are things that the ears tell us that the eyes don't, and vice versa. There's a reason we have the both of them, they're, they're redundant in some ways, but in other ways they supplement each other and provide information that the other doesn't. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>And so you can get into sound design questions of what would sound add to this that you don't get from a visual graph, and how might that be interesting for either helping somebody understand the dataset better or helping somebody who can't see experience a data set, who would not be able to see it, or to engage students who might find a, a static or a, a silent graph to be somewhat remote. And therefore, a challenge for a teacher who's trying to get them excited about a new field of study that they may, that may be foreign and a bit intimidating to them. And there's this chance that perhaps if it's presented as music, it will be inviting to them and get them interested in something that they haven't been interested in previously. I, I guess I should, I should stress that I'm not the only person that does this. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>I mean, Meg does this Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, my friend who introduced you to me. Meg does this. There's a, an international organization called the International Community for Auditory Display that has a conference every year. There are people like, Bruce Walker at Georgia Tech and Camille Perez, she, she does work in Sonification. There's a guy named, <span style="color:red" data-ts="277.305" data-end_ts="277.525" title="277.305" id=c_"277.305">__LAR__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="277.595" data-end_ts="277.885" title="277.595" id=c_"277.595">__Jung__</span> who works at Michigan Tech. There's, Thomas Herman over in Bielefeld in Germany. There, there are people all over who do this kind of thing. So I'm just one person who does this. I guess what makes me lucky is that I, I was, able to sort of <laugh>, I mean, you laugh that you, you found me by accident when you put the call out. But that's how I do everything. <laugh>. I always kind of slip in. I slip in through the back door and, and hopefully it, it's the right place for me to be. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>So I, I was, working down at the, college of Information Science and Technology here at, at Penn State, and I was working on teaching an experimental course and on sonification and writing a chapter for a book. And that was all kind of fun. And I, I had spent some years, you know, working on various projects thinking, you know, it's inevitable that sound is gonna be a key to information for scientists. Somebody's going to crack that nut, you know, and I hope it's me. I hope that I'm the one who comes up with the killer app that suddenly is like a light switch going on. And everybody goes, wow, how did we ever get by without this? And suddenly everybody's listening to things. It was kind of starting to bother me that that didn't seem to be happening after like 10 to 15 years. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Nobody seemed to be coming up with that aha moment that revolutionized things. And I was starting to think, you know, maybe there won't be an aha moment. You know, and why should there be? If you have scientists who have worked in their field for 20, 30, 40 years, and they've relied on visual graphs, they're gonna listen to me. Hey, I got the, just the thing you need. All you need is a pair of speakers and a good pair of headphones, and you need to get into the habit of listening to stuff. And, you know, of course, they're like, well, okay, thank you. We'll look into this. And, you know, sometimes there's cautious interest, but it certainly wasn't the revolution that I had hoped for, you know, so serendipitously enough, I saw that a musician that I'd always admired was playing downtown in our state theater. This was Mickey Hart from The Grateful Dead. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>He's one of their drummers. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> <span style="color:red" data-ts="399.205" data-end_ts="399.245" title="399.205" id=c_"399.205">__and__</span> this ethnomusicologist and very, very, musically and culturally curious fellow. And I saw that he was working on this film with George Smoot, who is a Nobel laureate. He's at, Lawrence Berkeley or University of California Berkeley. Lawrence has a few incarnations there, but he's, he's in the, the research division. He helped to discover cosmic microwave background radiation. And so for that, he was a co laureate of the Nobel Prize in 2005, 2006. So, so he had taken his Nobel money and set up this Berkeley Center for Cosmological Physics, which was an outreach program to interest kids in science and, and set the scientific agenda for the 21st century. So he's working on this outreach project with Mickey Hart, a a film called Rhythms of the Universe. And they wanted to have visualizations and sonification, and do this kind of rhapsodic poetic celebration of human's innate yearning to understand the cosmos. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>And they had done this dry run of it at a conference in Mexico, and I read this little thing about it, and it said, we're gonna be continuing to work on this, and if anyone has data sets, they would like to contribute to this. They can contact this fellow at, Berkeley Labs. And so I thought, wow, I didn't know Mickey Hart was doing sonification. <span style="color:red" data-ts="483.795" data-end_ts="484.085" title="483.795" id=c_"483.795">__Well__</span>, how did I not know this? <span style="color:red" data-ts="485.035" data-end_ts="485.325" title="485.035" id=c_"485.035">__What__</span>, so I thought, well, let me just, you know, drop this fellow a line and offer my services to them. And so I got my foot in the door there. And that to me was, that to me was a, a, a game changer because one, it upped my game as far as the quality of the work I was doing, because then it wasn't so much a concern of how informative is this? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>How accurate is this? Can we understand something from this? It, it had to function as music. And so I figured somebody like Mickey Hart was not gonna be interested in having an intellectual discussion with me about why this was an accurate rendition of a dataset. You know, if I was lucky, he would listen to something and within a second or two, it would turn him on, or it wouldn't Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And that was gonna be that. So it had to sound good. So it had to do both things. It had to have the scientific integrity, but it also had to sound good. Fortunately, I passed that test, but I thought, you know, maybe this is, this is the, the key to this, you know, rather than trying to change the way scientists work now, if, if we can get to kids, and if we can raise a generation of kids thinking that science is something that you listen to, as well as that you look at that aha moment may come from one of these kids, and it may be 20 or 30 years, but if they just grow up thinking, well, of course you'll listen to it, just like, of course you look at it, that that was probably a more promising route to go. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>So I switched my focus more to, to musical scientific outreach than in informatics. And that's, that was a healthy shift. And it was, it was a great project to work on this film called Rhythms of the Universe that they did that started to open some doors here at, at, Penn State. You know, I've been running around, talking to people, you know, rubbing sticks together for a few years, and <laugh> never quite getting anything to Ignite <laugh>. But 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What a great way to, what a great way to describe that process. I know exactly what you mean. It's hilarious. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Yeah. Well, you know, but it's a funny thing because, we'd go around and have coffee with people, and we'd have these pleasant chats the way you do, and they're, oh, okay, well, hmm. Well, but of course, this, you know, have you thought of this? And then I'd say, yeah, but, you know, I met with Richard <span style="color:red" data-ts="623.085" data-end_ts="623.205" title="623.085" id=c_"623.085">__Ally__</span>, who's a, a renowned, climate scientist here at Penn State. He's a world expert in this. He's, you know, like the press turns to him when they wanna know things. I see him on CNN sometimes. And so he, you know, he's saying things to me like, well, okay, so if you're taking data points and you're making them into a pitch, you have to multiply them or transpose them, or you have to do something to them to make a useful pitch. So if I listen to this, I'm not going to know what the actual value is. And I said, well, yeah. I mean, you're absolutely right. You know, if that's what you need, Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, then this is probably not very useful 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>For you. A numeric display might be what you're looking for, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b><laugh>. Right, right. You know, what's the right tool for the job. Right, right. You know, if you want to understand the dynamics, if you wanna understand the behavior of a function over time, well then this could be really useful, because that's what the ear is really good at, is sensing little changes in rhythms and pitch and things like this. So, so then I knew, okay, be on the lookout for that question. 'cause people are gonna be asking it. So have that answer. Ready. Anyway, I do this, and people are, start to get interested in this. And I, like, three years later, I went to Richard Ali's Friday pizza seminar with his grad students, and it was to see if anybody had some climate data that we could use in a, in a symposium that was coming up. So they said, yeah, we don't know what we're gonna do, but you know, come on to the seminar. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>You're welcome. And I said, oh, really? Because <span style="color:red" data-ts="710.205" data-end_ts="710.325" title="710.205" id=c_"710.205">__I__</span>, I have this movie that I could show you if, if you want. And they said, yeah, okay. So I went there and I showed them rhythms of the universe, and Richard absolutely loved it. He was like, wow, my goodness. What a fantastic outreach tool, this kind of thing is. And it <span style="color:red" data-ts="726.005" data-end_ts="726.085" title="726.005" id=c_"726.005">__was__</span> like, gee, a few years in a good project makes all the difference, doesn't it? <span style="color:red" data-ts="728.725" data-end_ts="729.045" title="728.725" id=c_"728.725">__Right__</span>. You know, you didn't know what I was talking about before, but now that I've got something in hand, you can see what I mean. Yeah. You know, funny story about Richard Ali, but I, so I, I was able to do, they had a thing called the Polar Center at Penn State. It was a scientific outreach, arm of the, of the, earth and mineral science, department. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>So they did these seminars each year. It's like a one day symposium where they talked about Arctic and Antarctic issues and issues of climate. And so they asked me in a grad student to do some sonification. They thought it would be interesting. So we sonified, we got, based on this pizza lunch, we talked to a guy named Dave Pollard, who had all this ice <span style="color:red" data-ts="769.925" data-end_ts="770.205" title="769.925" id=c_"769.925">__core__</span> data of the Antarctic. So it told the story of conditions there over the past 400,000 years Okay. Of, the area of the ice and the volume of the ice, and the amount of ice that was connected to the land versus what was like shooting off into the sea and what the solar energy was. And so we, we represented these 400,000 years in about six minutes, and people thought that was kind of neat. So they asked me to do it again the following year, and they connected me with a guy in forestry who, measures the body temperatures of arctic squirrels. <laugh>. See, this is the cool thing about this, is that I meet these people that most other people in the school of music don't meet. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Never gonna run into this. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Yeah. So how many people in this school of music know that there are people who go up to the Arctic, that go up to Northern Alaska, like as close to the North Pole as you can get, and they observe these squirrel colonies, and they know where they live, and they know how many of them there are. And so they capture them and they implant these little temperature sensors in them, and then they let them go. And the temperature sensors record the squirrel's body temperature every, it was like every 13 minutes or some odd prime number, 13 minutes or 17 minutes, something like this. But they, they get these body temperatures for a year, and then they capture them again, those that they can catch again, those that are still alive. And then they remove this thing, and then they can study the data sets. And so I, they're very interesting animals for a number of reasons. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>So that, that was kind of fun. And then, I got some interest in that, because the picture of the squirrel was so cute. You know, <laugh> <span style="color:red" data-ts="871.265" data-end_ts="871.685" title="871.265" id=c_"871.265">__resist__</span> the picture of a squirrel. So you're like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="873.405" data-end_ts="873.525" title="873.405" id=c_"873.405">__wow__</span>, you make sound outta squirrel body temperatures, <laugh>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="875.965" data-end_ts="876.085" title="875.965" id=c_"875.965">__I__</span> said, yes, I did. And it's actually quite an interesting thing, you know, the way these arctic squirrels, they go underground, and then they go into, they call it torper, which is like, not quasi hibernation. And anyway, these, these, annual cycles are quite interesting. And then the following year they had me do something based on migrations of, of, caribou and muskox in Greenland. It's, phenology, it's, it's cycles in the circle of life. This is something that, that a number of scientists are interested in. It's like the, the caribou live on the coast during the year, and then in the spring they come inland to calve, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="917.965" data-end_ts="918.125" title="917.965" id=c_"917.965">__then__</span>, and then they drop their calves, and then they, they go back to the coast. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>And so they rely on the food supplies being in place when they get there. They're conservative, they've come at the same time for thousands of years. But because of climate change, it gets a little warmer earlier and the food grows earlier, and by the time they get there, there isn't as much food available. Mm. Okay. And that's when they really need the food, apparently, is once they've given birth, because they need it to, to lactate, to, to feed them. So it affects their populations. And, you know, it affects the whole food chain. You know, what other animals are depend on the caribou being there. So this is, this is something that scientists are interested in, you know, so, so I did that and, was introduced to a, meteorologist named Jenny Evans, who worked in tropical storms. And she was interested in, having sonification of these storms and adding them to these satellite videos. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>You can see satellite videos on Noah's website, and you can go there, choose one, and you see a satellite video, and that's what they look at. And so she had me add sound to it, and she liked it. She thought it added a lot to it. She also found that it gave her some information sometimes that she didn't get just by looking at the video, that the sound actually told her some things about the storms, dynamics that weren't so apparent from the video. That was, a productive, meeting. You know, she asked me to do one storm, and then once we got that down, she said, oh, well, can you do a few more? I'm going to this conference in Korea. Can you do a few more? And, you know, by the time she went, she had 11 of them in hand. And then she got this idea that we could do a, a video animation of, 12 months of storms on a global map, as she put it, view the spaghetti of storms that occur all over the world throughout the year. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>She picked 2005. I guess that was an active year. And, you know, it's a very different perspective to look at the whole world and see where and when storms are coming up and intersecting with each other. So this is, this is, something that we're really interested in pursuing, you know, as has become apparent over the past month or so, it's kind of important for us to understand tropical storms. Right. And their effects and what they can do. Especially when I read that there were scientists who were warning developers in Houston, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1073.705" data-end_ts="1073.925" title="1073.705" id=c_"1073.705">__th__</span> this place is vulnerable to flooding. And if you put concrete and asphalt everywhere, it's gonna be even worse. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, because there will be no place for water to go. And of course they get blown off, ah, come on, you're anti-development, you know, we're trying to make money here. What's wrong with you scientists? And then <laugh>, there we go. Harvey comes through and it's like, okay, you get the point now. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. And everyone's like, well, why didn't you tell us in some way that we understood, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>You know? That's true. There is, there is something to that. There is something to that. I met with somebody, just yesterday. I was at University of Rhode Island, and he said that very thing that, you know, we try to put warnings out and we think that we're being clear because we get it. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> it sometimes isn't clear to people who don't spend their whole lives doing this. Yeah. And so, you know, he found this interesting because it's very engaging. I mean, everybody that I've shown these videos too, these satellite videos, and you see 'em on the news sometimes on tv. It's like, you see these kind of swirling things over a shifting map, and you have things like state outlines drawn in. It's kind of hard to see, and it tends to jump around. And there are these colors that show something <span style="color:red" data-ts="1141.765" data-end_ts="1141.805" title="1141.765" id=c_"1141.765">__<laugh>__</span>, I don't know. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>But you know, if you know what you're looking at, it's informative, but it's, I I add for example, this swirling windy sound to reflect air pressure levels. So as air pressure drops, the storm gets more intense. And so you can hear the storm getting more intense quite clearly. And everybody who's seen these goes, wow, that is so much more visceral. It is so much more engaging, right. When the sound is added to this movie. And so this fellow I met at University of Rhode Island, you know, he's interested in this, this, this could help him make his case, right. That there is a danger and that this is what can happen. So I was at University of Rhode Island because I, I'm partnering up with some oceanographers up there. Actually, I had an opportunity to go to this conference. They call it a conference, but it's more like a workshop think tank. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>It's, it, it was called nfe, which is National Academy's, Keck Futures Initiative. The Keck Foundation, Keck, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1206.525" data-end_ts="1206.685" title="1206.525" id=c_"1206.525">__pe__</span>, they were an oil family on the west coast, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1208.645" data-end_ts="1209.085" title="1208.645" id=c_"1208.645">__alright__</span>. Like about a hundred years ago. So if you go to the West Coast, you'll find Keck Institutes and Keck Museums and Keck, this and Keck that. They were a philanthropic family. You know, they were like the Carnegies and Rockefellers people like this. Okay? So they, they put some money aside with the national academies of, science medicine and engineering to do these, conferences based on a theme each year where they would bring people together, about a, a, a given theme. So I guess one year it was like neurology, can't think of what they did in other years, but 2016 was the deep blue sea. Okay. What can we say about the ocean? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>The ocean is important. It, it is the source of a lot of life and energy on this planet. And it's characteristic or changing due to climate change. And there's a whole lot we don't know about it. You know, we, there, there's, they're constantly discovering new species there, new characteristics underground, like, under the ocean, you know, like these thermal vents a few years back <span style="color:red" data-ts="1280.975" data-end_ts="1281.265" title="1280.975" id=c_"1280.975">__were__</span> a huge discovery. So that was the theme last year. And they're, they're, they were starting to bring artists to this thing too. And the idea was put you guys in. So it wasn't like a conference where you, have people who deliver papers and talks. They were like, okay, this is when it is, and we want you here for the whole time, and we want you to tell us where your interest is, and we want to put you into groups and we want you guys just to percolate and come up with stuff you could do together. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>What are some interdisciplinary projects that could either advance the discipline in terms of research or in terms of communication? Because they recognize that as being important too, almost as important as the research. Right? Right. If the general population is ignorant, then they don't know what's going on. You want people who are aware of what the issues are so that they will elect politicians who will make conscientious policies. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Right. So what's the best way of doing that? And they thought, we'll bring artists in. So I applied to go to this thing, and they, they took me. And so I, I met, Karen Wishner there, who is a, a, oceanographer at University of Rhode Island. And she thought, you know, I show these graphs to students in Intro to Oceanography class. It would be kind of interesting to see how they would respond to them if we presented them as sound. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I said, you know, this is actually exactly what I need because that's the case I'm trying to make, is that this is a good thing. This will help students learn. And I've had people come up to me after I give, you know, like enthusiastic talks, like, wow, isn't this cool? Look at this movie I worked on and y and then, you know, somebody's gonna come up to me giving me this look like I'm a used car salesman, <laugh>. And they're gonna say, so what assessment data do you have on this? Right? Right. And then I sort of say, well, I mean, I did a little bit when I wrote my thesis, but that was really the least interesting part of it. But I mean, I've got that, and I was kind of, you know, I come from the arts, you know, music, we, you know, it's like, what? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>How do you assess a symphony? I mean, what, what does that even mean <laugh>? We don't think in those terms. But I've, you know, I've evolved and thought, you know, not having anything whatsoever is indeed a liability. And it, it does hurt my case. And it would be really nice if I had a class, like a college students and the, and, and if I worked with somebody who does know how to do this, a science education specialist, right. Who knows how to do assessments, I mean, the right kind of assessments. I mean, there are some assessments that I, I've compared it to like refining wheat to make white bread. You know, <laugh>, it's like you take all <span style="color:red" data-ts="1454.085" data-end_ts="1454.205" title="1454.085" id=c_"1454.085">__the__</span> good stuff out there. There are assessments that do that. Like, I'm gonna be real cautious when my <span style="color:red" data-ts="1460.165" data-end_ts="1460.325" title="1460.165" id=c_"1460.165">__kids__</span> starts taking standardized tests in school this year. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I'm gonna be going, okay, no one number is gonna tell me how smart my kid is. Right. Right. You know, but you wanna do these tests. We'll see how it goes. But there are correct ways of doing it. I mean, they have focus groups for movies and albums and things like that. So that's what we're gonna do. We applied for one of the nack, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1479.525" data-end_ts="1479.685" title="1479.525" id=c_"1479.525">__these__</span> seed grants, and lo and behold, they gave it to us. So I went up to Rhode Island earlier this week, and I met with Karen, and then while I was there, I met with this meteorologist. And so they're really eager to try this. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1492.405" data-end_ts="1492.685" title="1492.405" id=c_"1492.405">__They__</span> think there's some real potential there. And we talked about spending a couple of days doing these graphs about what species you find at what depth. There's, there's this a thing that they, they call the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1508.275" data-end_ts="1508.565" title="1508.275" id=c_"1508.275">__dile__</span> vertical migrations. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>And it's this kind of amazing pattern. These, these creatures that travel up and down and up and down several hundred or thousand meters every day. They come up, at night to feed near the surface. And then they skedaddle down below the surface to avoid predators during the day. And it's like a human being running a hundred miles back and forth every day if you consider the size of these creatures. So this is something that they're real interested in. And they go out on these ocean voyages and they keep finding new little critters out there that are doing this. And so what do you find where and when is something that she's interested in? So we were gonna spend a couple of days on that. But then I'm talking with her partner and he is like, well, you know, we, we do general science stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>So I mean, there's no reason we couldn't do other things too. And just present a bunch of stuff via sound throughout the semester this spring. And wouldn't that be interesting to see if the students remember that as an interesting part of this class that you played us all these interesting things, you know, ha having NFI invest in us to do that. You know, it's amazing. That's what I've been needing is buy-in from somebody, you know, there was somebody to give us a grant and say, yeah, find out about this. Here's $50,000, you know, get back to us. That's like, wow, thank you very much. This is a big step from being like the, the Dancing Monkey in a scientific presentation, <laugh>. It's like, oh, by the way, we've got Mark here who's gonna play us some nice music. Thank you very much, mark. Now back to our regularly scheduled programming. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>I mean, that was good. There's a time and a place for that, but like, to really dig in and make a case, I need to be able to do this. And, and so that's, that's where we are. I mean, it's, it's nice. It's been getting some real interest. Penn State put the word out on me. And so I've been hearing from a lot of journalists who are interested in this and getting speaking invitations. And the other grant that I got from NFE was to work with a marine biologist and musician. Her name is Heather Spence. She works for a thing called Michelle's Earth Foundation. And she happens to have an interest in underwater recordings. So she, she records underwater around the Gulf of Mexico all the time. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And she studies the life down there based on what she can hear. So she can hear, oh yeah, I can hear a lobster there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>And I mean, she knows how to recognize these auditory Hughes. After I finish working with Karen Wishner this year, then I get to spend another year, year and a half working with Heather. And that's gonna be a, a, a more of an artistic based project where it'll be like a performance piece. And we'll start with her recordings underwater. And then on top of that we'll layer sonification of characteristics of let's say the water or, you know, the temperature, the salinity, the oxygen content, things like this that she has. And then I'll translate some of that data to the cello, and she'll play the cello on top of this. And I'll translate it to flute as well. 'cause my wife plays the flute. So there'll be this, this, this, flute cello duet playing over this electroacoustic and underwater acoustic recording. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, that's gonna be a lot of fun. Sure. You know, so that's, that, that was the second grant I got from nfi. So that's gonna keep me <span style="color:red" data-ts="1711.325" data-end_ts="1711.485" title="1711.325" id=c_"1711.325">__outta__</span> trouble for, for a couple of, well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It, it sounds like one of the things that I'd say is that you are starting to get validation for some of these I ideas that hasn't existed previously. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Yeah. You know, you keep at it long enough and <laugh> Yeah. You, that can start to happen. Well, I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Also think it's interesting that you're getting validation along a lot of different avenues. I mean, you know, the kind of validation you get from Mickey Hart's attention is maybe a little bit different than the kind of validation you get from a NFI grant, which is different from what you get asking, you know, being asked to do an interview on CNN or whatever. You know, it's, it's really interesting that it's kind of coming from a lot of different avenues simultaneously. Do you think that some of that is an influence of the fact that data, data visualization has gotten to be so ubiquitous that now people are like, well, if visualization works, you know, sonification might work too. Do you think that that's, it's sort of like a tag along function, or do you think it's because it does, it activates people in, in a unique way? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Yes. To all of that <laugh>? Yeah. I mean, it's, I mean, icad came into being in the early nineties when it was becoming clear that the future of communicating information was not confined to print, which is what it had been. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> up until about that time. But the, the, the emergence of powerful computing, I mean, you know, what I can do in my laptop now is far more than I could do when I was in college. I mean, when I was in college, personal computers were just coming out, you know? Right. And fonts were the big thing, <laugh>, you know, so the rise in what digital technologies allow us to do and how they allow us to combine information. The people who started Icad, I mean, most particularly Gregory Kramer, he was the one who said, well, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1838.445" data-end_ts="1838.685" title="1838.445" id=c_"1838.445">__there__</span> sound has existed in science. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>I mean, we've got things like sonars and Geiger counters and other things. Let me do a comprehensive study of this and put it all together and codify it and make this into a field, because, that's gonna be a way to communicate in the near future. And certainly now, with a lot of books being online, or portions of books online, we hosted the, ICAD conference here last summer. I chaired it, and Meg was one of the co-chairs, and she did this session on putting things on Wikipedia and how to make information available like this, and how to make Sonification and put them onto Wikipedia. So that, and that was one of, one of the points that our keynote made <span style="color:red" data-ts="1892.055" data-end_ts="1892.405" title="1892.055" id=c_"1892.055">__Carla__</span> STI, is <span style="color:red" data-ts="1893.125" data-end_ts="1893.205" title="1893.125" id=c_"1893.125">__that__</span> we, you know, we're very close to a time where <span style="color:red" data-ts="1894.985" data-end_ts="1895.205" title="1894.985" id=c_"1894.985">__you__</span>, you'll just read stuff online and there will be a button that says, turn the sound on. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And then people will, and people will listen to it, whatever they're looking at the graph, let turn that into a melody or something, and then, and then listen to it. And the reason that they'll be interested in doing that is that it's cool to listen to stuff. I mean, as human beings, we just, we, we like music <laugh>, you know, we are extremely responsive to music as a species. That's one of the things that separates humans from other forms of life, is that we have this, this very refined art of, of music that's extremely powerful. I went to a, a talk a couple of weeks ago, a forum, Penn State Forum. They bring in authors and artists and people like this, and they, they give these luncheons at the hotels. So there's a hotel lunch room holding about 400 people, 300, 400 people, I don't know. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>But it's this fellow who wrote this book called, we Gotta Get Out of This Place. And it's, it's about the music. He, he's a sociologist and a Vietnam veteran, and he is writing about what a cultural focus, the Armed Forces Radio Network was for the troops. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> in, in Vietnam, and how it did so many things for them. And it was this common culture that they all had. Troops don't have that now because they're wearing earbuds and listening to iPods, you know, but back then, they were all listening to the same thing. And there, there was all this music, and all of them have stories attached to these different songs. And, and so he's playing these excerpts of songs from people who are my age and a little bit older. I was in grade school during the Vietnam War, so I, I had a limited understanding of what it was, but I heard the music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>I could tell it was powerful, even though I didn't fully understand it. So here he is playing excerpts of Bridge Over Troubled Water and what's going on, and stop, say, what's that sound? Or Bob Dylan. And when he does this, it is just palpable. The whole room goes, oh, I love that song. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And they're, they're, you know, nodding their heads and they're singing along to it. And then he tells the story of, of why it was important to this soldier in the book. But then he is like, but you know, you see how important it is to all of you. You all have your stories associated with this too. That is the power of music. Music taps into our memory centers and our emotional centers in a way that other senses just don't. And so, I mean, when I was in Rhode Island, I mentioned that, and I said, you know, I, I, I wanna be careful here. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>I mean, I played you these sonification, I mean, I'm not saying that these sonification are the next bridge over troubled water or anything like that, but what I am saying is that music has power. That's not a, that's not my opinion. That's not a supposition. We know this. I mean, this is, I mean, that's why it's used in Alzheimer's research. It, it repairs neural pathways. It's a key to remembering things and getting brains that are damaged, functioning. Again, music has this power. And given that, doesn't it make sense for scientists to leverage musicality in their work and to use this in some way, either for their own edification or for engaging people, whether they are students or policy makers or funders. If you can grab people with music, then you're getting at them in a holistic, intuitive way that you're not gonna get by showing them a graph. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I mean, you kind of made a mention of some skepticism that came from people who were like saying, well, hey, the, you know, this maybe isn't a precise way of transferring the data. What are some other areas where you get, kind of skepticism about it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>I've had people ask me whether I am, compromising the data just to get into a little bit more of, of how it works again, right. In, in the kind of work that I do. There are different approaches to this. So, like Thomas, Herman and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2151.955" data-end_ts="2152.245" title="2151.955" id=c_"2151.955">__Biel__</span> does it differently as, model-based sonification, which is different than this. This, what I do is what they call parameter based sonification. And essentially, I'm working in a software synthesis program, work in Super Collider. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So in Super Collider, I can create an instrument, a synthesized instrument, and I can parameterize it, so I can change characteristics of the instrument. So, you know, start the instrument bong, there it goes. Now change the pitch, change its fan position, change the filter, change the volume, change all of these things. I can do that while it's sounding, or I can keep playing notes on it and have it sound a little bit different, which means that I can bring in the data set, and then I can have that function like a player piano role or like a midi file. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Right. And then the instrument plays the data set. So sometimes people will say, what do you mean you make an instrument that plays the, the data set? You're telling me that you're listening to the data. I'm not listening to the data. I'm listening to your instrument. Right. And I will say, yeah, you, you are right. I never said, you're actually listening to the data. What I'm saying is that this instrument is an effective way of communicating the behavior of the data. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, it's, it is symbolic. Sure. Like I say, I'm ready for this one. Then I'll say, you ever look at MapQuest? You know, I, I got MapQuest here. Here's a satellite picture of where my house is. You see that? You can see that it's kind of green there. I live in the forest, don't I, I don't live at the beach <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>I don't live on a polar region. Isn't that nice? Okay. Would you like to drive to my house? You will probably click these map view button, which is a symbolic view, and it shows you where the streets are. It even shows you where gas stations and hotels and restaurants are. Right. And would you say that that has less integrity than the satellite picture? I mean, it's not literal, but it, it gives you information that you need if you're driving. Right. So it's not less integrity. It's what information do you need for the task at hand? And, and this came up at the premiere of Rhythms of the Universe. George Smoot was really good on these things. He, he said, you know, when we look at pretty pictures of space, you know, in the media, you know, it doesn't really look like that out there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b><laugh>, you know, NASA cleans them up. NASA colonizes it so that we can see electromagnetic bands that are outside of the visible region, and they do it to inform us, and they do it to engage us. And we don't accuse them of cheating or anything. You know, that's, that's what you do. The other thing he said was, when you have a really complex data <span style="color:red" data-ts="2322.225" data-end_ts="2322.445" title="2322.225" id=c_"2322.225">__set__</span>, I don't care how complex it is, whether it's the history of the world, whether it's the structure of the DNA molecule, they put it on something that's about the size of a newspaper. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Because 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>That's what we can take in. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yep. You 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Know, and, and that's not cheating. It's doing what you need to, to communicate it. That's, it's called informatics, you know? So translation and interpretation and symbolizing is not some renegade streak and sonification. It's what you do when you're communicating information. You put it into terms that can be understood. And then of course, you offer disclaimers and you say, well, this isn't the real thing, but can you understand? I can show you other ways too, and we can dig deeper, but that's how you get started. So that, that's another answer I have ready <laugh> Sure. When people raise that objection. That, but that, that's the real thing. That this, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2373.025" data-end_ts="2373.245" title="2373.025" id=c_"2373.025">__the__</span>, the sonification is really good for dynamics. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I was gonna, I was gonna ask about that. What, what in your experience is the best data to catch through Sonification? Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Well, time-based data is, is a great candidate for Sonification. The other thing that's a good candidate is, multidimensional data. Oh yeah, of course. We, we know that the ear is better at following multiple streams of information than the eye is. The eye is good for static characteristics like size and color and texture and that kind of thing. The ear is our dynamic sensor. The ear is really good at telling us about pitch, about rhythm, about spectral changes. You know, the ear was designed to warn us immediately when there was a predator in the jungle. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> that would eat us if we didn't do something quickly. And it, it, you know, whether or not we can see it, it's our, it's our early response mechanism. That's, that's what, Seth Horowitz calls it in his book, the Universal Sense. It's our 24 hour early response mechanism. Yeah. When you have multidimensional data, it can get tricky to visualize it. But sonifying it, that's, it's the same thing as we do when we listen to chamber music. We're listening to multidimensional sound shapes and how they interact with each other. So, a time-based multidimensional dataset is a, is a real good candidate for Sonification. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I think a lot of people would be curious, how musical does the, do these sonification end up? And how much liberty do you feel free to take a, again, this goes back to this idea of, you know, you wanna make it a rich and, and useful and interesting thing for the listener. Taking, taking something that's pure data and making it, making it musical. Calling something musical is actually kind of a tricky word, I think. <laugh>. Yes. Maybe that's what I'm 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Getting at. Right? Yeah. Well, sure, sure. I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Mean, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2504.125" data-end_ts="2504.285" title="2504.125" id=c_"2504.125">__and__</span> so how, how do you describe musical in a way that makes sense? 'cause not everything that's gonna come out of dataset is <span style="color:red" data-ts="2512.365" data-end_ts="2512.565" title="2512.365" id=c_"2512.365">__next__</span> necessarily going to fit the parameters of what people would think of as say, pretty 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Well, that's the design challenge. That's the fun of it. <laugh> is, is putting it into some, I mean, it's the same thing you do when you visualize it. How do I make it look pretty? Right, right. But yeah, what is musical? That's, I mean, I, I gave a talk once and then this, there was this person, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2539.365" data-end_ts="2539.585" title="2539.365" id=c_"2539.365">__was__</span> writing for the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, and she was actually writing an article on Meg and Sonification, and Meg said, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2547.005" data-end_ts="2547.225" title="2547.005" id=c_"2547.005">__oh__</span>, even know Mark's giving a talk. Why don't <span style="color:red" data-ts="2548.865" data-end_ts="2548.945" title="2548.865" id=c_"2548.865">__you__</span> talk to him? He'll be in dc. So she came up and she talked to me afterwards, and her first question was, would you call this music Uhhuh <affirmative>? And I said, well, you know, that was kind of the interesting question in the 1950s. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know, when, when John Cage was writing pieces, like four minutes, 33 seconds and doing these, these, these, chance <span style="color:red" data-ts="2571.705" data-end_ts="2571.985" title="2571.705" id=c_"2571.705">__based__</span> pieces. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>And it was like, really? Is that really music? You know, listening to the environment is that music. And, you know, that opens up discussions of what it means to listen and what music is. And that, you know, 60 years later, that's kind of, we've had that discussion and we, we can kind of accept that anything can be music. I mean, so you can go <span style="color:red" data-ts="2592.705" data-end_ts="2592.825" title="2592.705" id=c_"2592.705">__in__</span> by soundscape CDs and all kinds of things. Anything can function musically. But what I told her was that the more musical sonification are perceived to be, the more interested people are gonna be in working with them. Right. That's the question that composers face. They write something that sounds good to them. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, what kind of pitches, what kind of counterpoint, what kind of harmonies, what kind of orchestration, what kind of rhythms sound good to me? And gee, I hope they sound good to other people too. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b><laugh>. And, you know, you may have a teacher that helps you and says, you know, it would be more musical if you did this right. Or you might, you might have friends or people like that who help you with that. But it ultimately comes down to the composer writing something that she likes, and writing something that speaks to her, and hoping that it speaks to others as well. So I'm not sure how to quantify that for composition or for Sonification. I mean, it's, it's very gratifying when somebody like Mickey Hart likes the way stuff sounds, or when other people like the way things sound when Jenny Evans says, oh, I want some more of this. Give me some more. The Polar Center says, oh, would you come back again? We really liked what you did last year that indicates that it's somewhat successful. I gave this talk the other day at University of Rhode Island, and they got their multimedia guy in there to record it, which was nice. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>And I happened to see him afterwards and he said, you know, I, something I, I gotta tell you, I don't know how you deal with this, but I found that really distressing to listen to that stuff, <laugh>, if I didn't have a job to do, I would've left the room. You know, it just really unsettled me. And I said, wow, I, you know, I'm sorry. I, you know, that's certainly not what I intend. And I didn't, I I haven't heard that before. You know, that's, that's good to know what you, at at least one person had a very negative response to this. You know, I don't know what to do with that just yet. That's like somebody coming up to you and saying, you know, your music sounded terrible to me. I I really didn't like it. Go Well. Okay. Well, sorry, <laugh>, you know. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, but on the, on the other side of it, I mean, if you think of, if you think of what you did, you basically took a data set and made, got someone to be emotional about it. That's extraordinarily 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Powerful. Yeah. You know? Yeah. It, it got to him <laugh>. Right. That's for sure. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. I have to write that down as a future artistic pursuit. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b><laugh>. Well, you know, that came up actually when I was working, when I did my thesis in grad school, I was working with cardiologist. That's how I got started in this was Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. I, I got a call from a physiologist who wanted, was interested in somebody to make sound out of heart rate variability data. Right. It was Leon Glass. He was my trip down the rabbit hole, you know, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2756.205" data-end_ts="2756.485" title="2756.205" id=c_"2756.205">__went__</span>, he was just this guy. I didn't know he was this pioneer in chaos theory, you know? So that became my thesis. And, and we were working with, with a cardiologist at, Beth Israel in Harvard, and he suggested that we, focus on obstructive sleep apnea and how that shows up in the heart rate. Ari Goldberger, did I say his name? That's who that was. There, there are these cycles, there are these patterns that, you can hear. And it, it was this kind of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2784.985" data-end_ts="2785.205" title="2784.985" id=c_"2784.985">__woo__</span> in a certain way. And I was saying, you know, okay, that's revealing, but it also kind of makes you seasick to listen to it. <laugh> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2793.745" data-end_ts="2793.965" title="2793.745" id=c_"2793.745">__ar__</span> was like, yeah, but that's good. It is sick. It's unhealthy. That's, and I was like, no, it's not good. I don't wanna make people sick by listening to this stuff. It makes me sick to listen to this. I'm gonna have to change this somehow. So <laugh> Yeah. That came up back then. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I don't necessarily want to actually experience the, the physical issues of the patients. Correct. Not a winner <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Yeah. Well,

<b>Darwin: </b>Mark, I can't believe our time is already up, but before I let you go, all of this discussion makes me want to ask what's probably gonna be the most obvious and probably the question that you're asked more than anything, but I still want to know the answer. <laugh>, of all the different kinds of data that you've worked with and all different kinds of scientists and sciences you've interacted with, what's been the one that's been most interesting for you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>You know, the cosmological stuff that I did for Rhythms of the Universe, but of course that was a whole range of data sets. But, you know, that played into my early, you know, star Trek fan self and my mm-Hmm. <affirmative> little kid who watched the moon landings and all of that, the stars, the astronomy that, that's, I've always found that captivating, you know, the natural sciences are of interest to me. So like, I'm real happy to work with oceanographers as a conscientious human being who is concerned about what the planet is gonna be like when my son is my age. I would like people to be aware of keeping this place healthy. And if I can do anything to help with that effort through sonification, let's just say I don't have any trouble sleeping at night doing that. So I'm, I'm real gratified that so many people seem to like these tropical storm sonification. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>I mean, whether they're my favorite or not, everybody seems to want to hear more of these Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and, and wanna do more of those, you know? And Jenny Evans is somebody who was willing to work with me and say, you know, could you tweak this? Could you tweak that? And not just say, oh, yeah, okay, thanks Mark. That was nice. I'll call you <laugh>, but who really wanted to see it work and really wants to continue to see it to work. And I, I'm dependent on that. I, I can't do this by myself. It's an inherently multidisciplinary task. So I need a scientist who is committed to making this work. And so, you know, so that was Jenny. You know, she's fantastic. So I guess the storms, I, I can't get away from how effective those seem to be. Right. I'm kind of dancing around your question. 'cause it's like saying, what's your favorite child? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Sure. I I imagine <laugh>. Well, and, and also the fact is, is that normally in my podcast, we talk a lot more about people's background. We didn't get a chance to, because your, like, current work is so vital and, and, and huge. But I think also there's something about this being an unexpected source of collaboration and how completely engaging that must be. I mean, you know, instead of just treading the same lines of, well, I'm gonna find a, a drummer and a bass player to play with, or a cellist and a violinist to play with. Instead you're like, well, I'm gonna find <span style="color:red" data-ts="2980.885" data-end_ts="2981.005" title="2980.885" id=c_"2980.885">__a__</span>, you know, I'm gonna find someone who really understands network to data, and I'm gonna find somebody who understands storm data and the three of us are gonna collaborate on something amazing. I mean, that just seems like that's gotta be so freeing and so interesting 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>That that's it. That's exactly it. I feel so much smarter for being able to interact with all of these scientists. I mean, who are much smarter than I am, you know, but I dabbling in cardiology and meteorology and cosmology and now oceanography. I mean that, it's so enriching to be exposed to the way all of these people think and see things. And to be able to join all of that with music. To me, that's more interesting as a composer than whatever else I might think to do. Although it's, you know, I like to keep my hand in on this. So it's, I mean, my wife is a flutist and she's, they're hoping to play at the flute convention next year. Some of her collaborators, they're from Taiwan, and they asked me to write a, a flute piece for them, and I said, yeah, sure, I'll, I'll fit that in somehow. And they're like, we have this theme of the ocean and the winds of the ocean <laugh>. And my wife <span style="color:red" data-ts="3050.985" data-end_ts="3051.205" title="3050.985" id=c_"3050.985">__is__</span> like, wow, you know, he's visiting with oceanographers as we speak. I bet he's gonna love this <laugh>. So it's even gonna be able to find a way, somehow into writing for a flute trio, which is kind of cool. That's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Fantastic. Well, mark, I want to thank you so much for taking time outta your schedule to, to talk, talk with us and kind of fill us in on, on this world. It's, I've been wanting to talk to somebody about Sonification for a while, and, this is really fascinating. It's really interesting to be able to dive in on the subject a little bit. Thank you so much. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Well, thank you. It's been a privilege to be here. Alright, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>With that, I'll, I'll, let you have the rest of your day. Thank you so much. And bye now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Bye-Bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Many thanks to Mark for spending time talking to us about Sonification. It's good to know that we've got somebody on the job not only helping us to interact with the data, but actually to help us understand it. Thank you so much for continuing to listen, for passing this along to friends, family, wherever. Really appreciate it. Stay tuned. We got a lot of great stuff coming up in the next few weeks. So, with that I'll let you go. Have a great one. Bye.
