<b>Darwin: </b>All right. Today I have the great pleasure of getting a chance to talk to Mic Frank. <span style="color:red" data-ts="15.545" data-end_ts="15.765" title="15.545" id=c_"15.545">__Mic__</span> Frank is the, the big brain behind Pure Magnetic, a company that does, sample packs and, some programming and rack collections, that I certainly use in Ableton Live. I've been using 'em as demo material a lot when I, do Ableton live demos. I've been trying to corner Mica for a while, and I finally got a chance to get a chance to talk to him today. So with that, I'll shut my cake home and we'll talk to Micah. Hey, Micah, how are you today? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Micah Frank: </b>I'm pretty good. Darwin 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thank you so much for taking the time to, to spend with us. I appreciate it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Micah: </b>Yeah, sure. No problem. Looking forward to it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So why don't we start off by having you talk a little bit about the work that you do? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Micah: </b>Yeah. Well, as you mentioned, I am the, founder and lead sound developer at, pure Magnetic. And, for those not familiar with Pure Magnetic, we've been making sound libraries for almost 10 years now, with a specific focus on Ableton Live, but we're also working to develop libraries for contact and logic. So these are the three platforms we support. I've been working also, I, I work very closely for the past 10 years with Ableton directly helping develop their sound catalog and, even some other instruments like sampler and operator. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, you mentioned to me that, you were just in the process of moving back to the US from, were you in Berlin? Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Micah: </b>I was living in Berlin for three and a half years, and just moved back this past May. I was on the road for a while and, yeah, now I'm moving back to Brooklyn again where Pure Magnetic originally started and, you know, where I, have a lot of my roots. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure, sure. So let's talk about your roots a little bit because, I'm curious, and we'll come around to talk a little bit more about the pure magnetic stuff, but Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I will just say that my experiences with, with pure magnetics work go back almost the full 10 years that, that you've been around. And one of the things I noticed is that, you know, some of your earliest offerings, in addition to doing like synth sound collections and stuff like that, you always had sort of this tendency to do kind of glitchy material or like funky toy collections. It, it always, it, it seemed like you had kind of a sense of humor and, a sense of fun surrounding the samples that you were collecting. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, which kind of makes me think that you have an interesting background that makes, that, <span style="color:red" data-ts="181.925" data-end_ts="182.245" title="181.925" id=c_"181.925">__makes__</span>, makes those things appealing to you. So how'd you get to, how did you get to the point that you're at? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Micah: </b>You know, I started off as a, playing drums, and I played, as a kid through, you know, high school and, then I, you know, studying jazz, and I also played in rock bands, and I ended up gonna music school at the new school. So I was kind of on, on the path to be a jazz musician or session musician, which I ended up doing in New York for a while. I played session drums. <span style="color:red" data-ts="211.485" data-end_ts="211.605" title="211.485" id=c_"211.485">__I__</span>, I worked at a big recording studio in, in, at Union Square for several years and did, engineering, drumming, some sound design. And, yeah, I think, I mean, I was never really interested in sound libraries or even music technology so much. It's something that just sort of evolved in my career as I, progressed. Actually, Ableton working for Ableton was actually what got me started in music technology because, I did some of the first, operator presets. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Micah: </b>I did a lot of the first operator presets before it was released. I could find my way around logic pretty easily, actually pretty good at logic at the time. But as far as synthesis and all of this and, programming sounds, I didn't have, very much experience at all. So that was pretty much the gateway into, into that whole world. You know, I, I had for years worked, had a, a midi setup for maybe five years at that point, and, had been, you know, very basic home studio thing. But yeah, I wasn't a big gearhead or synthesis type person at the time, you know, moving ahead a few years, I've had, pure magnetic, evolved into something that, for me, it wasn't a, for me, it was a commercial endeavor, but it was also a sound design showcase for, for me Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Micah: </b><affirmative>, I like to think of, I like to think of pure magnetic as a way for me to pursue my own, passion, which at the time became sound design, and also being able to make a living out, out of, out of it. And you can see this also, I think in the breadth of the pure magnetic catalog. There's a lot of bread and butter sounds. I mean, there's a, there's like electric <span style="color:red" data-ts="312.765" data-end_ts="313.045" title="312.765" id=c_"312.765">__base__</span>, there's roads, there's, you know, you have all the staples in the catalog, but you also have, as you mentioned, all of these kind of fringe things that we've sort of carved out a niche for. We have a lot of glitch and, circuit bent stuff. And there's also a lot of my personal favorites are some of the soundscape packs, which, you know, allowed me to be very experimental with the processes. And, being able to add something very, unique and full of character on top of the more bread and butter sounds that we have not to downplay the bread and butter sounds. They're actually very well, produced and recorded. A lot of those, those sounds I was only involved in on the kind of more management level. So most of the glitch and, and weird things are programmed by myself. My partner Brian Cass, who works at Berkeley now, that did a lot of the more, acoustic sounds and, those types of recordings 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Going back, you said that you kind of started off as a drummer and you, you hadn't been that tightly involved with technology Mm-Hmm. But at some point, you must have gone on a journey that just basically said, I have to dive into this because going from, Ooh, I don't care about, music tech to programming operator things, there's, there seems to be a link there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Micah: </b>Yeah, you would think so. <laugh> <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But maybe 
</p>

<p>
<b>Micah: </b>Not. I mean, literally, literally it was, it was kind of an overnight, I I literally, it was like a trial by fire kind of thing. That's awesome, because as I said, someone, I mean, all of a sudden, <span style="color:red" data-ts="409.525" data-end_ts="409.645" title="409.525" id=c_"409.525">__I__</span>, I had this gig making operator presets. I'd never made a, I, I don't even think, I mean, I, I had an idea of what FM synthesis was, but I didn't, I had no idea what it consisted of, you know, I had no idea that how to, you know, that there's, you know, modulators and carriers and routing and all of them, you know, LI didn't even, I don't think I, I don't even know if I knew what an LFO, I knew what an LFO was, but I didn't know, like, you know, what the different waveforms did. I didn't know like, what a pitch <span style="color:red" data-ts="437.385" data-end_ts="437.605" title="437.385" id=c_"437.385">__end__</span> below, you know, all the basics. And so I was all of a sudden programming some sounds for operator, maybe <span style="color:red" data-ts="443.705" data-end_ts="443.925" title="443.705" id=c_"443.705">__not__</span>, 2004 or something like that. So you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Just jumped <span style="color:red" data-ts="447.805" data-end_ts="448.005" title="447.805" id=c_"447.805">__at__</span>, jumped into the deep water. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Micah: </b>Yeah. I said, well, I think I got offered the job <laugh>. And I said, yeah, sure, I can do it. No problem. <laugh>. And, and next thing, I mean, I remember one night I was, I was, you know, making patches <span style="color:red" data-ts="460.665" data-end_ts="460.885" title="460.665" id=c_"460.665">__or__</span>, and, I mean, I learned it pretty quick. I, I became very comfortable with it very quick, which I think is a testament for how intuitive operator actually is, because I was very comfortable on it after just, you know, maybe a week of programming. You know, I had a, obviously a very steep learning curve. And then that I was also on these email threads with like, Robert Henke and Richard Devine, and, you know, they were throwing all of this, shop talk back and forth, and I was like, I didn't have any idea what <span style="color:red" data-ts="489.545" data-end_ts="489.765" title="489.545" id=c_"489.545">__was__</span>, what was going on. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Micah: </b><laugh>. The funny thing is, is that I think, you know, half of the presets in the original operator library were, or a good portion of them were ones that I programmed. And then from then I, I went on to program, some sounds for FM eight. Yeah. A bunch of sound design. I ended up, you know, I ended up consulting with Ableton during, when they were developing sampler, you know, to, to, so within a period of like two years, I just really learned a lot about, synthesis and, music technology and, and even, even with the, with the onset of pure magnetic, I, you know, pure magnetic demanded that, that I, that I know about, synthesizers and synthesizer history and, and, music technology. So it was really just from, from the beginning of starting Pure Magnetic, it's just been a, a learning process as well. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's pretty fantastic though then, and in a way, it just seems like it points to you having kind of a gutsy personality too, that you don't shy away from trying, jumping into something that maybe you don't necessarily know cold. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, what is it, what is it that puts you in a position to be able to do that? Is it just, do you spend a lot of time networking and getting to know people, or, do you have, like, is there a, a corner of Brooklyn where you're really well known and that happens to be a place for a lot of other folks? How do, how do you get, how do you get your connections that help you get these gigs? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Micah: </b>Well, it's not, I, I wouldn't say that I put any, any significant amount of effort into making connections. I, it is hard to say. I mean, I think there's different types of, people that work in, in different types of businesses. Some are out there making connections. I think others, and I probably fall into this category, just look at, opportunities that have come as a, as, a series of random events that have led to one another. <laugh>. I mean, for instance, I just worked, or I didn't just work, but a few years ago I worked on this film, San Andreas, you know, it's this earthquake movie, earthquake disaster movie. And the composer for the film got in touch with me. He, he saw some of my work with, earthquake Sonification, which is basically, a project I made in 2010 that's takes, real time earthquake data with a Max Patch, pulls the data down, and then throws, the OSC information into <span style="color:red" data-ts="641.085" data-end_ts="641.205" title="641.085" id=c_"641.085">__a__</span> chemo patch, which then generates all of these different sounds, in with a eight speaker array. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Micah: </b>He, I didn't realize at the time that anyone would really see this. I, I just, you know, put it online. You know, I submitted it to a few festivals and, a few years later then, he was just, I guess he just looked up, he might have just Googled something, earthquake sounds online, <laugh>, earthquake sounds, something, and my name popped up. And so that's how I got that gig. It wasn't any <span style="color:red" data-ts="673.085" data-end_ts="673.485" title="673.085" id=c_"673.085">__matter__</span>, it wasn't a matter of making connections or anything. Sure. I mean, so there's that element. There's also, I mean, we, pure Magnetic was <span style="color:red" data-ts="679.565" data-end_ts="679.725" title="679.565" id=c_"679.565">__at__</span> NAMM for a few years, you know, it's a good place to make connections in, in that industry as well. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and also you're, you're out there too. I mean, it, you're, you're well known in the game, but also you do a good job of making sure that people know that Pure Magnetic is, is out there. I mean, certainly Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, within Ableton Live world, people see your name attached to pacs that, are either provided as default packs or, packs that are for sale, but also, you do a pretty good job of marketing. But I think that there's something to be said for just literally having a lot of quality work out on the web, because that, I mean, really, you're probably right. Someone Googling for, for Earthquake Sounds is gonna eventually run across that thing that you worked on, and that's how opportunities present themselves. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Micah: </b>Yeah. You know, I, I, I definitely wouldn't be able to do this without the internet because I'm not, I wouldn't have been able to, to have this career, you know, 30 years ago. Not only because Pure Magnetics only has an online presence. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But mainly because I'm not the type to go out and network and, you know, be, physically present <laugh> to try and to try and get work. I much prefer, letting the, the internet, do my networking for me <laugh>, I guess. Sure. You know, I've spent a lot of time doing SEO, optimization and research and stuff as well, not only for Pure Magnetic, but you know, for, for some of my own projects, just so that, you know, there's a better chance that, people will find it. But 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I think that that's actually really an important thing, because I think oftentimes people get really focused on doing the artwork Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, but don't realize that even just putting it out there for people to find is a valuable thing. I, maybe it's just a personal thing, but in a way I'm getting a little tired of sort of like the NAMM style of schmoozing, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> where, you know, you, you meet somebody and you, you, shake their hand and talk about how yeah, we have to get together and do some things together. You never hear from 'em again. Right. Because really it's just a matter of, you know, they're talking to you until somebody more interesting comes along or something. Uhhuh 
</p>

<p>
<b>Micah: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. And, it does seem like I, I have had a similar, similar arc where it seems like, having been around and doing my thing in the age of the internet, all of the, all of the opportunities that have come along have been sort of like this random thing. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And it never came from overtly networking. It, it more came from putting stuff out there and the re and the result of that coming back. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Micah: </b>Yeah, I agree. I mean, I think that for every, at least in my own experience, the amount of effort that you put into something, you're, you're gonna get back out of it. When that's gonna come is, is, who knows. But, I, I think it comes back at some point. I mean, pretty much, you know, if I'm willing to put, <span style="color:red" data-ts="860.145" data-end_ts="860.365" title="860.145" id=c_"860.145">__and__</span> not only, not, not only effort, but, passion as well, if you're, if you're, I think that has a, is a, is a big, creates a lot of momentum to get, a project going or, it's, it's, yeah, what goes in comes out <laugh>. Sure. Absolutely. You know? Yeah. I've seen this with a lot of my, my projects that I've, this earthquake project I was just talking about. I don't know why I did it. I mean, I might've been in some weird craze, like, who wants to set up a big eight <span style="color:red" data-ts="887.765" data-end_ts="888.005" title="887.765" id=c_"887.765">__speaker__</span> array and spend two months making this Max pads and, and, then I also had it, connected to <span style="color:red" data-ts="894.785" data-end_ts="895.005" title="894.785" id=c_"894.785">__the__</span> Google Earth, API, so the Earth would spin and all this <span style="color:red" data-ts="898.325" data-end_ts="898.525" title="898.325" id=c_"898.325">__stuff__</span>, you know, at the time I didn't know what I was doing, and right now I'm working on something also, I don't know why I'm doing it, but, I think something will come out of it eventually. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Micah: </b>So I guess a lot of it is, it's about just pursuing what you want to do for the right reasons, you know, not for, for the sake of, of becoming more popular or something, but just, because it's something in you that, that you feel needs to be done. I mean, that's another thing with Pure Magnetic as well, is it grew very organically. I didn't know, I didn't have a <span style="color:red" data-ts="924.845" data-end_ts="924.965" title="924.845" id=c_"924.845">__specific__</span>, particular purpose in mind at the time. I mean, I had a bunch of extra presets, leftover for, from Native Instruments work that I did, and also from, work I did for Ableton, I had a, I had a, 'cause usually a sound design process, that these companies employ is, is something like, you do the work and we take what we want, <laugh>. Right. And then you're leftover with a bunch of stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Micah: </b>And so yeah. Pure magnetics sort of just grew out of this. I had a stockpile of sounds. I was like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="952.165" data-end_ts="952.285" title="952.165" id=c_"952.165">__oh__</span>, I'll put them online, see what happens. I wasn't really like trying to grow a business at the time. It was just like I wanted to share my sounds and I wanted to develop sounds. And, but yeah. It's funny because the, what <span style="color:red" data-ts="963.245" data-end_ts="963.445" title="963.245" id=c_"963.245">__you__</span>, going back to what you said about the, the NAMM networking thing, it's, it just reminded me of, you know, I, I spent, I haven't been to NAM for several years, but I was, I was there at the Native Instruments booth for, for a few years, and then Pure Magnetic for a few years. Yeah. I always came home with this like, huge pile of business cards, <laugh>. Right. And they just sort of sat there for <laugh> six months. And, and then after, you know, in June or something, I would just put 'em in the garbage. Right. And, and, it reminds me, I was actually in the, in the elevator with a, a, a CEO of a particular software music company, <laugh> music software company. And he's like, yeah, I just take all my business cards after NAMM and throw 'em in the garbage <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Micah: </b>Like, ah, yeah. That's, that's a good technique. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, exactly. So let me ask, a little bit about the kind of, development you do, because I'm curious with this idea of working on three platforms simultaneously, you mentioned that the work you do is you do a lot of work, around Ableton Live and the devices in Live, but you also do work with Contact, which is a completely different engine with completely different kinds of technology behind it. And then you said Logic, which I assume means the EXS sampler generally. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Micah: </b>Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And so, again, a completely different kind of, and a different level of technology as well. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And so what, first of all, do you generally work on one and then, adapt to the others? Or do different projects drive you towards different devices as the primary development platform? I'm curious about it because Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> to me, that's like, that's like saying I'm gonna write a book and I'm gonna do it in English, French and Russian <laugh>, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Micah: </b>Yeah. Yeah. And, and for some stories, it comes out better in a diff in, in one of the three languages, <laugh>. Right. Yeah. So that's, I mean, that's actually a really good analogy. That's a good question too. Basically, you know, there's a few formats that these, that all of these, that all, all of these different platforms are able to import. There's a few, like what I call, what I would call staple formats. Formats or primitive formats, which basically allow you to develop in one platform and then import it into the others. Because a lot of the, the platforms, when you import, samples or a program, they will interpret the, the key mapping and sample loop data. Sure. So, on, on the, on the basic programming level, this is kind of, what gets done. Now, there's a few, instruments in the pure magnetic library, a few, packs that are only for Ableton Live, and that's because it, it really has to do with the kind of modular structure of Ableton Lives Racks. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Micah: </b>Mm-Hmm. Basically, and, and you can do this in, in Contact as well, but the Delta for me as the lead developer and, pretty much the sole employee, pure magnetic is, is really too big to take on all these tasks at once. So, a lot of the more complex instruments are just developed for live. And what I mean by that is, for instance, there's a corg, wave station instrument in the pure magnetic library. And all of the, waveforms that are included in the Wave Station have been, I'll say, emulated in Ableton Live. And this is, and, and also the, the way that the waveforms interact with each other is only possible in live because the way that, racks interact with each other Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> or the way that racks can be programmed. Right. So, yeah, a lot of these, you know, when we, if I try and also the, f Smo instrument as well, and a few others in the, in the catalog are specifically developed for live just because of the modular programmability of it, as far as logic goes, logical. The the pure magnetic patches are, yeah. They run in EXS, although now you can also, I believe, load samples into Alchemy, which is included in logic, and you can do a lot of, cool tricks like spectral morphing. And, I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Just, I keep on forgetting that alchemy now is part of the Yeah. Part of the mix there, which is 
</p>

<p>
<b>Micah: </b>Yeah, they really undersell it. Yeah. <laugh>. Yeah. No kidding. Yeah. I mean, I don't think, you know, very few people, there's a lot of amazing features in Logic actually, that have recently come to my attention that are really, they just, they don't put a lot of focus on it. There's a lot of really innovative features in there. And yeah, it's definitely worth exploring. It's, it's this, it's completely, for me, logic is completely, keeping up with all of the latest stuff. It's evolving. It's, it's still an innovative platform. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I wish that, I wish that they didn't go so far. I mean, it seems like a lot of the publicity is meant to make it look like GarageBand plus plus Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, right? Yeah. But, when you actually get beyond the, kind of cartoonish keyboard pictures, <laugh>, it's a, it's a pretty, pretty scary, deep piece of software. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Micah: </b>Yeah, it is. I mean, this is, this is a piece of software that's just had, you know, decades now of evolution. Mm-Hmm. And it's, mm-Hmm. And, you know, they haven't really thrown much away. So, I mean, all of like the environment stuff and all of the, I mean, it was a deep program, you know, 15 years ago. Right, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1306.855" data-end_ts="1307.205" title="1306.855" id=c_"1306.855">__right__</span>. And they just keep, they just keep adding on and, you know, nothing, they're not leaving anything behind. Yeah. And I don't know if this has to do with the, you know, resources that Apple has or, you know, the ability that they have to acquire technologies is not really, it's not really comparable to any other <laugh> music software companies. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So I'm curious now with different systems. I don't know what the EXS or or Alchemy Engine might have, but I know with Live you have programmability with Mac using Max for <span style="color:red" data-ts="1341.285" data-end_ts="1341.525" title="1341.285" id=c_"1341.285">__live__</span> with contact, you have their extensive scripting scripting environment, which is Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I mean, some of the levels of that are like scary deep as well. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, do you get involved in much of that kind of programming, or do you mostly just work on sound design and put it in a relatively basic shell? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Micah: </b>Yeah, I mean, I've done all of, well, most of pure magnetics, context scripting. But yeah, we're on, on the performance level. I'm not really developing very much there. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So there is kind of a, there's a template basically that, that I use that I've developed for each pure magnetic contact pack. And we, I, I evolve it as KSP evolves as well. For instance, we just started putting, custom knobs and stuff on the ui, but in, from a performance standpoint, there's not really any MIDI effects, or we're not doing any of the a ET processing, I think that's what it's called, filtering that contact uses to smooth out, changes between samples. Okay. Not using any of that at the moment. I mean, I'm aware that it exists. I've used it in the past, but I'm not putting it in our libraries. I do program, depending on the synthesizer, I I'll program more extensively in the context scripting. I mean, all, all the instruments are different. I mean, if you can look at the library, the Pure Magnetic catalog, and you, you'll see like there's some, for some synthesizers for instance, it'll allow you to choose, you know, different voices or from different waveforms, it'll allow you, so it, it can get pretty interactive and the context scripting can get a, a little deeper, but in general, yeah, it's all packaged up pretty similarly. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>How did you get comfortable with, with programming? Because again, in both, in the case of scripting language of contact, I mean, that's some, that's some pretty, I mean, it's not, it's not c plus plus, but <span style="color:red" data-ts="1453.845" data-end_ts="1453.925" title="1453.845" id=c_"1453.845">__there__</span> Sure. You can get pretty deep with that. How did you get into the programming part of it? Again, kind of hack your way into it, or? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Micah: </b>Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I started programming like Action Script in 1998, <laugh> or something. I see. Okay. And, and from there, I just picked, you know, I picked up Java script. I picked up, I picked up Objective CII made all of pure, pure magnetic, used to have some iPhone apps. So I, I programmed, all of those. For me, it's like once you start programming, it's like learning languages. I think once you, once you get that kind of area of your brain working out, it's, it's, it becomes easier. I mean, programming languages are, are all very similar in, in a lot of ways. So, I mean, I could look at, I, I don't know, like Python for instance, but I can look at a Python, Python code and understand what's going on. And then once you starts, you know, so I mean, for me, KSP is actually, or contact scripting is pretty straightforward. I mean, once you have the documentation in front of you, it's, it's pretty easy to understand what's going on. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Is there anything that's just like totally mystified you, not just programming, but like, like across 
</p>

<p>
<b>Micah: </b>The whole, yesterday I read, I read something about Wave Terrain synthesis that really perplexed me. <laugh> <laugh> in the, in the C Sound manual. Yeah. So that was, yeah, I was like, what <laugh>, and, and it's funny because there's all of these, there's a bunch of scholarly articles about it too, and all of the analogies used don't really make any sense to me either. So <laugh> Right, right. Can easily be perplexed <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1550.125" data-end_ts="1550.405" title="1550.125" id=c_"1550.125">__Right__</span>. So in, so for developing the sounds that you do, what are, what's the toolkit that you use? I mean, first of all, I assume that you have synthesis and software tools that are your favorites. I also looking at, you know, looking at the content of some of the packs and stuff, it seems like you're out doing some field recording work too. What, what are the tools that you use that you kind of consider your main toolbox? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Micah: </b>Well, that's the thing is it's constantly changing. And I think that's what really gives the variety, the Pure Magnetic catalog. I mean, you know, for the time being, for, for a few years, pure Magnetic was just all about using, vintage synthesizers and drum machines and you, you know, as a, as a core base of things. But I'd like to think that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1602.845" data-end_ts="1602.965" title="1602.845" id=c_"1602.845">__a__</span>, you know, that really isn't in my field of interest right now. Whereas, you know, the latest few packs have been, I released two packs of, c sound generated, synthesizers and, and drum loops about a year ago. And now I'm also doing a lot of field recording. So it's really my, the, the, the tool set is really kind of what's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1626.005" data-end_ts="1626.325" title="1626.005" id=c_"1626.005">__inter__</span> what I'm interested in or feel like exploring at the moment. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I mean, I've spent the summer recording, field recording in, I've actually spent the last two years field recording around, you know, from the US to Germany to Costa Rica. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Micah: </b>So I have a ton of recordings now. I don't know what I'm gonna do with them, you know, whether I'm going to like Spectrum, analyze all of them and dissect them and reconstruct 'em somehow, or whether I'm gonna release them as is or, or whether, you know, I'm gonna create some installation with them or something. I, I don't know. I'm, I'm constantly curious. That's the thing about music technology, and I'm constantly learning, and not only about music technology, but about processes related to music technology. Right, right. So for me, it's just constant. It's like just on an adventure sort of, and I'm lucky that I have, you know, I have an outlet for it, basically that's pure magnetic, and I can create things and I can, I can release them as, as, products. I mean, it's still fun for me. I mean, as long as it stays interesting and, and new, I, I'm really, I feel very lucky to, to be able to do this. And yeah, my tool set is constantly changing. I mean, on the computer side of things, I'm always gonna be using live, I'm always gonna be using <span style="color:red" data-ts="1704.705" data-end_ts="1704.925" title="1704.705" id=c_"1704.705">__Max__</span> to some extent. I mean, really whatever is gonna get the job done. Sure. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1709.435" data-end_ts="1709.725" title="1709.435" id=c_"1709.435">__Kema__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Of all the stuff that you've done, what is the, what is the Sound Pack that you're most proud of? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Micah: </b>Sound Pack? I'm most proud of <laugh>. Yeah. I have a few favorites in there. As I mentioned before, a lot of them are the, the film scoring ones. 'cause this was actually, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, it's funny because I, I hadn't seen those before and when I was kind of prepping for this call, I, you know, I went through catalog and I ran across the section of the catalog that's called like, film <span style="color:red" data-ts="1743.005" data-end_ts="1743.165" title="1743.005" id=c_"1743.005">__and__</span> Scape. Yeah. Uhhuh. And it's like, that's kind of a new section. It's not something that you had really focused on prior that, that I had known 
</p>

<p>
<b>Micah: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1752.855" data-end_ts="1753.205" title="1752.855" id=c_"1752.855">__About__</span>. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And there's some beautiful stuff in there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Micah: </b>Thank you. Yeah. This is actually, you know, film and soundscapes are probably, I think they're the biggest selling category of sound libraries out there. I think that these sell not just for pure Magnetic, but for other companies as well. I mean, there's a few other companies like Sample Logic, I think, and heos and, you know, they really focus on this. They've, they, they've, I think they realized, you know, where the, where the market is. Right. But these are really, I think it's because the people involved in this, a lot of the professionals involved in this have the budget to purchase these products. And also I think there's a lot of aspiring, film composers and sound designers out there that, that want to be able to have access to these sounds. So yeah, I hope to develop that area of the catalog a lot more as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Micah: </b>Not only because it's a, a lucrative, category of sounds, but because I enjoy making them those sounds the most as well. I mean, I love making soundscapes sound soundscapes, and I love, you know, being able to make more experimental sounds, tensions and, sounds with different materials. So yeah, this category, the Pure Magnetic Catalog is definitely my favorite. I think there's a few packs, technosphere and Metal <span style="color:red" data-ts="1826.165" data-end_ts="1826.525" title="1826.165" id=c_"1826.165">__Sphere__</span> and, infinite Spaces, which is something that's actually an, an interesting one. 'cause I just took impulses and ran them through like a even Tides and lexicons and, just made, just spent like days making these like huge reverberating, swirling chorus textures and things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So now one of the things that happens when you do these kind of soundscapes though, is that unlike, say drum machine sample set, you're actually likely to hear these in place, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> you're likely to run across where somebody used it as a bed for a a video piece or a Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> or an installation. Have you, have you run across situations where you've heard these in 
</p>

<p>
<b>Micah: </b>Use? Quite honestly, I've never been able to pinpoint something <laugh> really. There's too much in the catalog for me to, to, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>To keep track of, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1877.985" data-end_ts="1878.205" title="1877.985" id=c_"1877.985">__huh__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Micah: </b>Yeah. And I mean, I've heard things here and there, like I've been listening to some electronic station or something and I'll hear like, something that sounds really familiar, and I'm like, Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I'm wondering like, maybe in the back of my mind <span style="color:red" data-ts="1892.225" data-end_ts="1892.445" title="1892.225" id=c_"1892.225">__on__</span>, I think maybe it's from, maybe I know it from pure magnetic, but I really, I couldn't <laugh>, I couldn't, I really couldn't pinpoint other than the demo tracks that are on the, the <laugh> pure magnetic website. Right. I wouldn't be able to, to pinpoint sounds, you <span style="color:red" data-ts="1907.325" data-end_ts="1907.365" title="1907.325" id=c_"1907.325">__know__</span>? That's funny. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, as part of putting together the catalog, you've gotten a chance to work with some pretty incredible people. The, the person I am most jealous of you working with is the, the opportunity you got to work with, Richard Lahar on the B system stuff. Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Micah: </b><affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>He was always a favorite artist of mine. And I, I miss his, his work and his influence on us all 
</p>

<p>
<b>Micah: </b>To, just to make a, just to make it clear, I did not personally work with Richard. My, my, my partner Brian Cass, who lives across the street from Richard, who I think who I believe was neighbors with Jordan Rues. <laugh>, unbelievable. He worked with Richard on the, the Bookless stuff. Right. Unfortunately I always wanted to, to get involved there, but I was too busy at the time. Yeah. Unfortunately, he passed away too early for, for me to, to get a chance to, to work with him personally. But I know, you know, Brian had a great time working with him. And we got some amazing material from his, his 200 e synth. You know, we've had a few interesting artists contributed PACS on pure magnetic, that that section is actually not there anymore. <laugh>. 'cause it was a legacy, like live eight section. And, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1985.245" data-end_ts="1985.365" title="1985.245" id=c_"1985.245">__I__</span> was trying to clean up the, the website, but there were a few contributions from various composers and sound designers. I worked with a few people when I, I actually worked at Ableton in Berlin for about, you know, 18 months or so managing their sound catalog. And I was able to, you know, collaborate with a, a few interesting artists while I was there. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Who do you hear out there that's doing interesting sound design work? I, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Micah: </b>I really like, some artists that are working with abstract textures and kind of big walls of sound, you know, like, Tim Hecker, Ben Frost, for instance. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. I'm also really inspired, there's a sound artist named Zi, Z-I-M-O-U-N-I think he's a Czech sound artist. He basically, he creates sounds with, ob everyday objects and well, like, he'll, he'll create these sculptures of like cardboard boxes with motorized things put in each cardboard box. I'm not really doing the description justice. 'cause 'cause he actually, he films it very beautifully and, and the sound is amazing. But yeah. I would check out his, his work on, on Vimeo. Okay. Also, Nicholas <span style="color:red" data-ts="2060.855" data-end_ts="2061.205" title="2060.855" id=c_"2060.855">__Barer__</span>, who I think has been, very fascinated with a lot of his work. Yeah. So this is what I'm listening to. I'm not really, I'm, I'm not really following music with any kind of form <laugh>, right, sure. Mainly abstracts, sound, sound design, sound sculptures, these kinds of things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And so, our time is just about up here is, before we go though, I always, I would like to know what is the future look like for you? What are the things that you're personally exploring? <span style="color:red" data-ts="2091.765" data-end_ts="2092.005" title="2091.765" id=c_"2091.765">__When__</span> you talk about kind of the abstract thing, you're obviously collecting field recordings, which probably points to some, some kind of interesting stuff. But what's exciting you now? What is, what is the thing that's got you revved up? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Micah: </b>I think there's a lot of, interesting possibilities now in 3D sound, not only in like virtual reality for instance, but just in terms of creating a, a different sonic experience with textures. And, and for, for me, I'm interested in, in, I have a vision for <laugh>, a type of experience where the sound and music are kind of, they're not separated by this line of form versus not form. You basically are engaged in a, an experience, an immersive experience. So I'm actually, you know, my, my goal for the next year is to actually try and create some works, that can define this kind of vision that I have for this immersive experience. So it's, it is a, a sound design work could be part of the pure magnetic catalog. It could just be something that gets lost on, in my blog somewhere, <laugh> <laugh>. But, but that's what I'm working on now. And I'm also could, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Could be the entree to you working on your next movie. Who knows. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Micah: </b>Right, exactly. I, I don't exactly, I don't know where it's gonna lead to. I have a feeling that, you know, maybe I, I work really hard on something, finish it, and I don't hear about it for another five years. But, that's fine with me. It's all a learning process and it's an adventure. An adventure and sound. Well, that's, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's actually a really inspiring way to put it and, and an inspiring way to kind of talk about the career that you've built for yourself. It seems like you've got a really nice, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2193.725" data-end_ts="2193.845" title="2193.725" id=c_"2193.725">__a__</span> comfortable way of doing your thing. And, and I certainly can appreciate that. It sounds, it sounds awesome. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Micah: </b>Thanks. Yeah, it is. <laugh>. <laugh>. Alright. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well with that, I'm going to, let you continue on with your day. Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with me. I really appreciate that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Micah: </b>Sure. Yeah. Thank you Darwin 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright, with that I'll say goodbye. Have a good one. Alright, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Micah: </b>Bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Many thanks to Micah Hyde for the time and the great chat. And many thanks to my family, my friends, and you, the listeners for continuing to support, listen to and, gimme the attaboys that I need to make this thing go out every week. Thanks a lot and we'll catch you next time around. Bye.
