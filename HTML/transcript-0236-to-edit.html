<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, today I get to speak to someone literally across the world from me, hailing from Perth in Australia. His name is Guy <span style="color:red" data-ts="23.225" data-end_ts="23.445" title="23.225" id=c_"23.225">__Ari__</span>. And, one of my listeners reached out and said, Hey, there's a bunch of cool stuff happening here in Perth. Take a look at this guy. I looked at it and I really couldn't believe what I was seeing. It was pretty amazing that I realized I'd heard about this before I started digging in. I reached out and he was, he was very happy to, come and have an interview. So I reached out and here we go. So rather than explain it myself, I am going to turn this over to, to Guy. Hey, guy, how's it going? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Guy Ben-Ary: </b>I'm very well, thank you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thank you so much for, taking the time out to have this chat. I am so curious about the work that you're doing, for people who aren't familiar with it. Why don't we start off by having you give a description of what, what your work, your current work is. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Guy: </b>Okay. First of all, thank you for your interest in inviting me to do this, interview. I'm an artist and a researcher in a, very special, I think <laugh> special Lab in Perth called SymbioticA, the Center for Excellence in Biological Arts. Again, as I said, I see myself as a researcher and an artist, and, working in the world of new media where the technologies that I use are emerging technologies and the materials that I use are biological materials. And, you know, the activities that I engage with are somewhere between growing and making. Just a couple of words about SymbioticA because I think that it's very much relevant to my work. SymbioticA is an art and science or a research lab into, biological art that is located in Perth, in the University of Western Australia. And, SymbioticA is quite, unique, lab in a sense that it, allows artists to engage critically and practically in practice in biological technologies. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Guy: </b>We formalized our relationship with the university and the lab lives, and, is located in the school of anatomy and human biology and the science faculty of the university. So it's not located in an <span style="color:red" data-ts="154.625" data-end_ts="154.845" title="154.625" id=c_"154.625">__ar__</span> art school or art environment. It's more in kind of the science kind of beat of the university. But at the same time, it's run by artists. The director, Oran Katzen, co-founder of the place, Oran <span style="color:red" data-ts="167.185" data-end_ts="167.605" title="167.185" id=c_"167.185">__Katzes__</span>, a biological artist as well. And he created this, or developed this, institution or, lab, research lab and, and was very, he was very strict with the fact that it would be run by artists and host artists, but it would be located in, a scientific environment. And that's quite, an amazing, space for people like myself because, you know, there's a lot of knowledge. There's a lot of scientists, there's a lot of people that are engaging with biological technologies, with biology and with kind of newly acquired knowledge that we, are kind of learning and producing these days in, in kind of those environments. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Guy: </b>But at the same time, the work is artistic. It's not there to communicate science. It's, it's, it's a critical work that is, developed in this, place. We get a lot ofs scientists that are collaborating with us. And, you know, there's quite a lot of, interesting projects that are coming out of this lab. So this is a little bit about SymbioticA and, and, and it's interesting 'cause symbiotic is one of, was the first lab as such in the world. And, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="232.885" data-end_ts="233.005" title="232.885" id=c_"232.885">__at__</span> the same time, there's not a lot of places like that in the world today. And Perth is such a, you know, isolated, you know, it's the isolated, most isolated capital in the world, they say. But it's still one of the <span style="color:red" data-ts="244.525" data-end_ts="244.805" title="244.525" id=c_"244.525">__kinda__</span> world capitals in biological arts, which is quite, interesting because of Symbio. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I've been, Symbio since, its inception in, the early two thousands. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Guy: </b>And, my work through there area, I produced quite a lot of work in SIMer. But, most of the work that I've done is kind of focusing, focused on, neural network unconsciousness, questions about question, questions about consciousness or intelligence, emergence. And, I've been looking at neuroscience. The, the interface between neuroscience and art, and most of the work that produce, involves, the, growing neural networks. So basically external brains, outside of the body. I mean, neurons are using tissue culture techniques. Tissue culture is a, a technology or technique that's been with us for <span style="color:red" data-ts="298.405" data-end_ts="298.645" title="298.405" id=c_"298.405">__year__</span> more than a hundred years, <span style="color:red" data-ts="301.225" data-end_ts="301.445" title="301.225" id=c_"301.225">__and__</span> tells us that we can actually grow cells outside of the body. Neurons, brain cells can be grown outside of the body as well. What I was really interested is growing them in, quantities that they would start producing or, creating neural networks, real biological neural networks, and growing them on interfaces that would allow me access e to and from, those, neural networks to communicate with those external brains. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Guy: </b>I just wanna say that one of the basis for the, one of the motivations for this work is an ethical one, the realizations that we can actually, that the newly acquired knowledge allows us to grow entities outside of the body to create life in labs. And, not only that, we can create life, we can create, entities that may have the potential to be conscious or intelligent in the future, right? We're not there yet, of course, but when the manipulation of life as we can, as we do it in labs all around the world, in every single lab in the world, when it takes place in an atmosphere, of conflict and profit-driven competition, the long-term result of those manipulations of those creations might be disquieting. Because the question is who does what and who can do what. And one of the roles I believe that art can play in this world is to suggest scenarios of worlds under construction to subvert or, subvert the technologies for the purpose of creating contestable objects. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Guy: </b>For instance, art can make the emergence of those living entities evocative and the multi-leveled explorations of those, objects, very important and very, relevant. So this is kind of one of the basic ideas behind the work that is kind of underlined under it's, it's, it's there, accompanied with all the work that I, produced previously. So, as I said, I'm, I was very interested in, creating those, living entities or entities that may have the potential of becoming intelligent, later on or in the future, not later on. And, ask questions about those scenarios that I'm proposing. So the, the technologies that I use are, basically, the hardware that I use are the neurons, those are the, the cells that I'm growing in the lab. I mean, these days I'm working also with heart muscle cells with cardiomyocytes, but I'll talk about that later. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Guy: </b>But really, the wetware is the main kind of hardware that I'm using and growing in the lab. The software that I use, is a stem cell technology that is called pluripotent stem cell technology, that, or IPS, that allows us to reprogram cells, to become stem cells. And then you can differentiate them to any type of other cells in the, body. So, you know, this is what I do with my own cells. I grow my own cells, skin cells that I can take through biopsies, and then I reprogram those cells to become stem cells, and then I differentiate them to become, neurons. So this is how I achieve or get my neurons Sure. Rather than, harvesting it for myself or from other, an animals or species. Right. Right. And the, the sensors that I work with, the interfaces is, the main interface that I use is called the multi <span style="color:red" data-ts="519.805" data-end_ts="520.405" title="519.805" id=c_"519.805">__electrode__</span> array. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Guy: </b>It's an electrophysiology system that is con consisted of amplifiers, but mainly a specialized, petro dish that has an array of electrodes fitted on its base. So there's a, a grid of eight by eight electrodes. Did I grow the neurons on top of those 64 electrodes, eight by eight electrodes. And when I plate the neurons and I start growing them, they form the neural network and they start producing, electrode signals on top of those electrodes. And those electrodes either, they are the read and write interface. I can listen to what the neurons are doing in 64 areas of the dish, the resolution C 64 in my, in the dishes that I use. Okay. But what's really interesting as well is that I can stimulate, I can talk back to the neurons. I can actually send information to the neurons through those electrodes as well in a resolution of 64, electrodes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Guy: </b>So I have a read and write interface for the neural networks, the neural networks, when they're plated, they're starting to, produce, in, data to, you know, the way neural networks work. And what are we trying to do is to stimulate those neurons and to kind of see if through those stimulations that we <span style="color:red" data-ts="592.845" data-end_ts="593.045" title="592.845" id=c_"592.845">__send__</span> to the neurons, we can change the functional plasticity of the neurons. We can get them <span style="color:red" data-ts="598.345" data-end_ts="598.565" title="598.345" id=c_"598.345">__to__</span>, we to, to change what they do to change their behavior. We can get them to learn or kind of show maybe any signs of emergence. Now, it's important to kind of, mention that it's not a brain, I call it an external brain <laugh>. It's not a brain because <span style="color:red" data-ts="613.405" data-end_ts="613.525" title="613.405" id=c_"613.405">__a__</span> brain, <span style="color:red" data-ts="614.705" data-end_ts="614.925" title="614.705" id=c_"614.705">__it__</span> how a brain consists of, you know, billions of neurons and trillions of synapses. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="621.285" data-end_ts="621.405" title="621.285" id=c_"621.285">__I__</span>, I'm growing 100,000 cells on this kind of interface. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Guy: </b>But however simple or <span style="color:red" data-ts="626.605" data-end_ts="626.725" title="626.605" id=c_"626.605">__a__</span> symbolic the brain, quote unquote, of course may be, they do produce quantities of data and they do respond to stimulations and they're subjective of lifespan. So it's very interesting to work with them. When I started to work with those kind of neural networks, I was really interested in what's happening there. What is the data that is produced within those kind of neurons? And this is how I got into kind of the idea of embodiment. What I thought about is to give those neurons or neural networks, or external brands, as I refer to them a body. And the embodiment was a strategy to highlight the <span style="color:red" data-ts="667.705" data-end_ts="667.905" title="667.705" id=c_"667.705">__live__</span> liveliness of those microscopic neural networks and to manifest their, I dunno, their, their erratic existence through movement and through behavior, and to create a feedback loop. So throughout the, the last 20 years, I produced various kind of artistic project where I gave those neural networks, various types of bodies, artistic bodies, robotic bodies, and those robotic bodies interacted through this interface with those neural networks, to, create a feedback loop between the brain and the body. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Guy: </b>And, you know, I mean, the, the work is concerned with the directions that those current emergent bio technologies would take us in the future. You know, I'm asking what are the responsibilities that we have to those liminal lives that we create, or what sort of ethical boundaries, do we need to establish around those, living, entities? Because when, when art <span style="color:red" data-ts="725.445" data-end_ts="725.645" title="725.445" id=c_"725.445">__was__</span> using, neurons <span style="color:red" data-ts="726.745" data-end_ts="726.965" title="726.745" id=c_"726.745">__had__</span> the potential to evoke responses in regards to the shifting perception surrounding the understanding of life. We are trying to bring possible scenarios, to life, to the neural networks, confront the viewers both instinctively as well as intellectually. I think, by calling into question the liveliness of those of those entities. You know, that when I say <span style="color:red" data-ts="753.605" data-end_ts="753.805" title="753.605" id=c_"753.605">__living__</span> alive, you know, when people or the viewers don't really know how to treat them, are they alive? Are they dead? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Guy: </b>What are they human? They're non-human. They're animated, they're not animated. So through this kind of work, I get people to try and think about what those living entities are. So the, the first project in this line of work that I produced, I, we called me art. That was, we, we, we were, I worked on it in the early two thousands where we, you know, we kind of thought the embodiment that we gave, or the body that we gave to those neural networks was a robot that, drew two dimensional, pictures or drawings, right? And one of the reasons that we made it an artist was that, you know, working with the scientists that in this same field, you know, the embodiment that they're kind of looking at, it was always utilitarian, you know? And we kind of try to think what would be the least util utilitarian, body that we can give those neural networks <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Guy: </b>So we made it an artist, of course. Right. You know, the scientist, an illustrator, right? Yeah. An illustrator. So this is kind of how it started with this kind of project, but I guess it's, I would like to go into more detail describing the current project that I'm working on through the years. I produced a few other projects, like projects like Silent Barrage or Inpo <span style="color:red" data-ts="836.965" data-end_ts="837.325" title="836.965" id=c_"836.965">__Potentia__</span>, various kind of types of embodiment. But, with a current project called Self, C-E-L-L-F. This project is, is my self portrait. So I applied to get funds to create a biological self portrait. And what I've done was I went and I did a biopsy, and I harvested, skin cells of mine, and I grew those skin cells in the, lab. And then I, reprogramed them to, become stem cells. And once they, became stem cells, I differentiated them to neurons. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Guy: </b>So I, in effect, grew my own external brain outside of my body. And that was quite an interesting process. Two years of, you know, looking at myself through the microscope, trying to figure out how to get myself do what I want, what I want those new, cells to become. Okay. And once I managed to kind of grow those, neural networks of my own, my own external brands on this interface, I was wondering how would I portray myself, what is, where is this kind of biological self portrait? And, you know, as I said, for two years, I looked at myself through the microscope, and the last thing that I wanted to do is to portray myself. I got a little bit sick and tired of myself. So <laugh> I decided to portray one of my childhood dreams. And when I was, 13 years old, the only thing that I wanted to become is David Bowie. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Guy: </b>I wanted to become a musician. And I'm not a musician. I'm not a musician at all. I can't play, on any instrument, but I do have quite a distinct tasting <span style="color:red" data-ts="938.875" data-end_ts="939.165" title="938.875" id=c_"938.875">__play__</span> in music, and I have a lot of musician friends, et cetera. And I always kind of <span style="color:red" data-ts="943.325" data-end_ts="943.565" title="943.325" id=c_"943.325">__drank__</span>, thought about how would it be to be a musician. So I decided to create my <span style="color:red" data-ts="948.215" data-end_ts="948.565" title="948.215" id=c_"948.215">__alter__</span> ego, rockstar, a rockstar in a dish <laugh>, and to embody, to embody my external brain or those neural networks that I created for my own selves with a sound producing body. So then I called the musician friend of mine, Darren Moore, he's a collaborator himself, and I told him about this project. You know, I, I, I shared a house, an apartment with, Darren in the early two thousands. And he's a drummer, he's a great drummer. He lives in Tokyo now, and he's very active on the experimental scene in Tokyo. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Guy: </b>And, but when we lived together, I kind of kept on saying, Hey, let's have a, let's let, let's play together. I'll sing. I don't know how to do anything, but I'll sing. But, you know, it wasn't really, serious. He always kind of dismissed me with, you know, <laugh>, get your shit together. If you wanna be a musician, be a musician. Don't no shortcuts here. Right? And I called him and I said, Hey, we are going to be on stage in two, three years from now. I have, I have my ways. He started to dismiss this, conversation again, or this idea again, until I told him what I'm planning to do. And then he got really excited. We decided to kind of collaborate on this project because I, because I'm not a musician, I thought that I, I, I would need someone that knows what he's doing when we kind of looking at the sound aesthetic and kind of structure and, improvisation and noise, et cetera. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Guy: </b>So, and he was the one that kind of proposed that I worked with analog modular synthesizers. And the minute that he kind of proposed that he kind of made sense to me because, in a really weird or overs simplistic way, analog modular synthesizers work in a very similar to those neural networks. You know, there's a control voltage that is kind of going, passing through or flowing through components, whether those are the neurites or the modules of the, synthesizer, you know, it's like a cv, right? Control that is kind of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1066.145" data-end_ts="1066.465" title="1066.145" id=c_"1066.145">__flowing__</span> to produce data, whether it's kind of neural data or sound. They work in a very similar way. And when I hooked up with Andrew Fitch, the synth builder, the guy that is actually building the synth for build <span style="color:red" data-ts="1080.645" data-end_ts="1080.845" title="1080.645" id=c_"1080.645">__the__</span> Synth, and again, self collaborator, when I hooked, with him, he kind of suggested, and I couldn't agree more, that we just keep the whole project analog right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1091.925" data-end_ts="1092.125" title="1091.925" id=c_"1091.925">__In__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1092.125" data-end_ts="1092.445" title="1092.125" id=c_"1092.125">__itself__</span>. Doesn't any computers microcontrollers programming nothing. It's, it's, this is why the analog synthesizer were so fitted this project so well, because, you know, the signal flows from the neurons through this interface to the analog modular synthesizer with no intervention. It's, it's like one network that is kind <span style="color:red" data-ts="1113.085" data-end_ts="1113.165" title="1113.085" id=c_"1113.085">__of__</span> flowing from micro to the macro. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So the neural interface isn't computerized at all. It's literally just sensors and, and amplifiers. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Guy: </b>Absolutely. Yeah. Unreal. There's no computer. Because the thing is that, you know, I have a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1127.445" data-end_ts="1127.645" title="1127.445" id=c_"1127.445">__si__</span> a rig in the lab that does it through a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1130.525" data-end_ts="1130.685" title="1130.525" id=c_"1130.525">__com__</span>, you know, you digitize, right? You get the neural network, you get the signals for the neurons through the A to D cards, and then you kind of see the data on the computer. But Andrew said, well, it doesn't make sense to digitize <span style="color:red" data-ts="1141.285" data-end_ts="1141.365" title="1141.285" id=c_"1141.285">__it__</span> and then turn it into analog again. Right? Right. Let's keep it all analog. And when I said, well, I would love to do that, but hey, I don't know how to, and he said, well, I, I'll build this rig for you. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So Andrew actually built <span style="color:red" data-ts="1154.805" data-end_ts="1154.925" title="1154.805" id=c_"1154.805">__a__</span> equivalent of this rig, through hardware, and it actually works better than the original one because there's no conversion that the signal is very, you know, there's integrity of signal. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Very direct, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Guy: </b>Yeah. So with self, what we are doing is not only that the neurons control, or they control the analog modular synthesizes through this interface that, Andrew, developed. You know, I didn't, I didn't wanna be a musical instrument. I wanted to be a rock star, right? So we, created this platform where we invite human musicians to play with self, and the music that is produced by the human musicians is streamed to the neurons through this interface, and modules that we, developed. And the neurons respond to those stimulations by controlling the analog modular synthesizers. And then there's a feedback loop between the human musician and the non-human musicians, which is happening all the time. And they're, they're basically jamming in a very similar way to the way musicians improvise in kind of a free jazz, concert. Right? So it's, it's basically like a post <span style="color:red" data-ts="1227.065" data-end_ts="1227.285" title="1227.065" id=c_"1227.065">__mod__</span>, post-human <laugh>, performance. And, and I think this is kind of in a nutshell self in my work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That's it. It's really quite amazing to, to kind of consider this as, I mean, when I wrap my head around it, it's, it's kind of bizarre. Now, I, so I have like 50 questions to ask about this particular project. So first of all, you're working with Darren, he's literally playing, it stimulates the cells, which generates some voltage that plays back, and then he's responding. So it's literally a two-way communication between the drummer and the cells. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Guy: </b>Yeah, definitely. And, you know, we also created these modules that we developed, not only that it kind of stimulate the neurons. We created those, gates that allow the mu human musician to, that allows the signals from the human musicians to access to the neurons only through a certain range. So basically the musician, the human musician, can also decide when to stimulate the neurons. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1297.785" data-end_ts="1298.005" title="1297.785" id=c_"1297.785">__Oh__</span>. Which is kind of even closer to, a set up where to musicians are playing together. You know, if I'll play the solo, it's drum solo and you'll play the bass, I would, we would have kind of, you know, we would look at each other and we would have various kind of signals on what, when do I do what, and when do you do, right. Your solo. And through this kind of, free <span style="color:red" data-ts="1320.205" data-end_ts="1320.445" title="1320.205" id=c_"1320.205">__gate__</span> system that, we developed, the human musician can actually signal the neurons by stimulating them in certain kind of times and certain kind of ways. I just wanna kind of say that the project is not limited to, Darren as a collaborator. We already had like nine performances, and in each performance we play played with a different human musician. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Gonna say one of the things that if you think about collaborating musicians, there's always, there's like these tat communications and also very subtle exchange of information. And it sounds like you actually have built a mechanism to do that. Did you say it's like through ra, is it like different frequency ranges? Or is it <span style="color:red" data-ts="1365.045" data-end_ts="1365.205" title="1365.045" id=c_"1365.045">__Yeah__</span>, kind of like spatial ranges, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Guy: </b>Different frequency ranges. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Guy: </b>And, and again, I mean, it's, it's let's you know, let's be frank. I mean, it's, it's quite symbolic, right? But it's still, it's still there and the musicians can decide to use it or not. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now what are, what are the, actually what are the kinds of responses that, that occur? I mean, so you say that this is roughly a hundred thousand cells that make up this, this, neural network. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1397.705" data-end_ts="1397.995" title="1397.705" id=c_"1397.705">__Yeah__</span>. What are the, what are the kinds of things that, when you interact with it, what are the kinds of things that you get as responses? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Guy: </b>Well, you know, this is, I, I, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1411.395" data-end_ts="1411.515" title="1411.395" id=c_"1411.395">__I__</span> don't think that I can actually answer accurately, and give you, an accurate answer to that. But I would say that the neurons would respond to stimulations in two different kind of ways, ways, you know, there's, the reflexive or the kind of immediate response when you stimulate neurons, they respond, there's a barrage of activity. Okay? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Guy: </b>There's a barrage of activity that subject to the way we patch the synthesizers. You hear this happening in various kind of ways in various kind of aesthetics, and that would change between kind of patching. But then the more interesting, way of them responding is them changing their functional plasticity over time. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1460.895" data-end_ts="1461.115" title="1460.895" id=c_"1460.895">__Mm__</span>. To control the synthesizers in a more interesting or less interesting way, hopefully a better way. But, you know, and, and that kind of poses a little bit of a problem with, self, because our performances are only one hour, and one hour is not enough to kind of, get neurons to learn or to get nerves to change. Right. So, you know, I mean, the ultimate performance of self would be over 48 or 72 hours or two weeks even, where the musicians are playing with the cells every single day, all day long, or as much as we can. And the stimulations are kind of sent to the neurons over and over and over and over. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Guy: </b>So when we have this one hour performances, there is some sort of a symbolic, gesture there, even though the neurons do respond and they do change sometimes. And, you know, if you listen through on the website to the concerts that are there, you can see that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1527.065" data-end_ts="1527.265" title="1527.065" id=c_"1527.065">__the__</span>, that Well, I think that those, that the music or the, the concert is quite interesting. You know, I mean, the neurons are doing things there. Yeah. And sometimes there're, there's things that they do, and we kind of look at each other and say, oh my God, where <span style="color:red" data-ts="1541.895" data-end_ts="1542.015" title="1541.895" id=c_"1541.895">__did__</span> this <laugh>, where did this <span style="color:red" data-ts="1543.055" data-end_ts="1543.255" title="1543.055" id=c_"1543.055">__go__</span>? <laugh>? So, you know, I can't really tell you that there is data that we produced that indicates that this is happening. Yeah. What we have is the concerts and really interesting observations, and, you know, I mean, we are not scientists. We're not there to produce data. Right, right. The project, as I kind of said, is looking at the future, is looking at suggestion, and trying to critique or trying to suggest those contestable futures and trying to critique, those technologies as much as we can through art. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Now, I'm really anxious to get into your background because that's one of the things I like talking about. But before we do that, there's one other question I have, because it actually is referred to a little bit in one of your previous works that you describe on your site. And for listeners, I'll have, in the show notes, I'll have links to his website, so you can dig into this a little more. But one thing I was curious about is to what extent there's any sort of like memory or kind of like embedded concept of a memory in these cellular, cell-based techniques. And the reason I ask is you actually, the description of an earlier work, which is I think, I remember it called snowflakes. I think that there was actually a different, name for it. But snowflake, it was, you actually attempted to embed like a, a specific shape in, in the cellular, network. And then you, did a cryogenic freeze, and unfortunately the mechanism broke <laugh>, and it was lost. Which actually, just in reading it, I actually had an emotional response to, which I guess is part of the artistic purpose, right? Is, is to get, is to get an emotional response to this as an idea because you are toying with what is life, what is just technology, what is our manipulation of portions of life, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. But that made me think about this idea of patterning and the concepts, you know, what are the different concepts that make up memory? And I was wondering if in this work, you talk about using this plasticity to sort of like, change the way things that resp people or the, that the system might respond to the people it's interacting with. Have you been able to experiment with it in long enough periods so that you could see where it would set itself up to maybe be very responsive to a certain player or be very responsive to a certain kind of stimulation in, in a almost repeatable way? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Guy: </b>Yeah. Well, you know, that's the $1 million question. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Guy: </b>But, no, I, we haven't, and as I said, I mean, we, it's an artistic project and not a scientific one, even though we are very interested in what the executive neurons are doing. Right. Unfortunately, self is very hard and expensive to install <laugh>. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And we don't have it set up, at all times. So we haven't done kind of long-term, experiments with self. I see. But, I'm, I'm, I'm trying to, work with, a few of my colleagues, scientists and artists to put in a grant to kind of do it scientifically. And doing it scientifically is doing it in a much more controlled environment, where you can actually do things repeatedly without, you know, you know, because when, when we are taking self on the road and we, we <span style="color:red" data-ts="1785.285" data-end_ts="1785.405" title="1785.285" id=c_"1785.285">__are__</span> installing it in galleries, there's noise and there's Oh, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Guy: </b>So many that are kind of changing. You really need to do it. And you need, you need to <span style="color:red" data-ts="1793.525" data-end_ts="1793.685" title="1793.525" id=c_"1793.525">__add__</span> a computer to kind of record the numbers and to kind of analyze them later on properly. Right. So we're not doing it. I see. But I think that the question that is in the heart or the, the, the, the core of self is whether different rhythms and different ensembles would, affect, self in a different way. Sure. Or functional plasticity in a different way. And I think that it's really interesting, I think, and, and a few neuroscientists really, experienced and, you know, well renowned kind of, neuroscientists that I've been talking to about this project, they're all very interested in the idea of end training of neural nets to see if something would, emerge. And I think that it's more about the rhythmic, behavior of the neurons and the kind of the rhythmic stimulations or the, the rhythm of the stimulations that is being sent or frequencies, to kind of, to the neurons. Sure. So I think that there's something there, and I think that it would be interesting to study. But self did not collect any data. As I said. It's more about, observations. Right, right. That we <span style="color:red" data-ts="1869.175" data-end_ts="1869.455" title="1869.175" id=c_"1869.175">__have__</span> through the music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Fascinating. The combination of things that you do for your work is a pretty bizarre combination. <laugh>, I mean, you know, from wanting to be David Bowie to harvesting your own cells seems like quite an interesting journey. How did you, how did you get to, to get drawn into this as a form of art? How did you choose to be an artist when it's clear that you also have this fascination with science? What, what is your route that you took to get where you are 
</p>

<p>
<b>Guy: </b><laugh>? It's actually a very, it's, it's interesting because, you know, I mean, nothing in my first 20 years of, first 25 years would, could indicate this path that I chose later on. You know, I grew up in Israel. I, I did grow up in a family that had, quite appreciation to art. You know, my mom has a quite an amazing collection of art in a, in the house. And, you know, we would always go to exhibitions and to openings and, but I never kind of thought that I would be a practicing artist. I studied, law when I was in Israel. And, then I, didn't really like it. So after I graduated, I started in the mid nineties to work in as a programmer and technologist in the first kind of internet, companies in Israel. But what really made the change was, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1965.425" data-end_ts="1965.845" title="1965.425" id=c_"1965.425">__living__</span> Israel and going for a visit to visit my, one of my best friends. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Guy: </b>Then, Oren Katz in Perth. And Oren, I met him in Israel and in Perth. He studied in Curtin University, and he did his honors. And one, I can't really remember exactly what he did there, but he was, he was the first one that, or that I know that started to kind of look at the idea of using tissue culture as an artistic medium. And, he got a couple of grants in the mid nineties, and when I came to visit him, he and his partner, you know, Durst just started their project, tissue culture and art project. And, I was fascinated by their work. And, you know, I was, I just came to visit them for six months. But I never left. So I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2015.655" data-end_ts="2015.875" title="2015.655" id=c_"2015.655">__sta__</span> started to work with them, and I started to, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2019.775" data-end_ts="2019.995" title="2019.775" id=c_"2019.775">__be__</span>, because they, they were very lucky in the sense that they approached this scientist. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Guy: </b>I don't, I don't wanna, really talk too much about their, what happened to them. 'cause I, I don't know if I can say it very accurately, but, you know, they approached <span style="color:red" data-ts="2032.075" data-end_ts="2032.235" title="2032.075" id=c_"2032.075">__and__</span>, scientist in UWA in the university where we work and, and, she was very, encouraging and accommodating, and they started to work in a lab. And when I arrived <span style="color:red" data-ts="2044.095" data-end_ts="2044.315" title="2044.095" id=c_"2044.095">__and__</span> to Perth, and I, I lived with them a little bit. The work that they did just <span style="color:red" data-ts="2049.065" data-end_ts="2049.355" title="2049.065" id=c_"2049.065">__blow__</span>, blew my mind. And I started to go with them to the lab. And this is where it all opened. Not long after I managed to get a, a job in the school of anatomy and human biology managing a, microscopy lab. And this is where I realized that, that's what I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2068.355" data-end_ts="2068.635" title="2068.355" id=c_"2068.355">__wanna__</span> do. I mean, I started to kind of engage with science and started to <span style="color:red" data-ts="2071.475" data-end_ts="2071.595" title="2071.475" id=c_"2071.475">__engage__</span>, but in a more kind of artistic way. I worked for the first three years I worked with, OR, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2077.335" data-end_ts="2077.555" title="2077.335" id=c_"2077.335">__and__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2078.075" data-end_ts="2078.315" title="2078.075" id=c_"2078.075">__<inaudible>__</span> on their own kind of projects. And I learned quite a lot from both of them. And then I started to develop my own work. So it was, it was this move to Perth and it was the, interaction with <span style="color:red" data-ts="2090.785" data-end_ts="2091.075" title="2090.785" id=c_"2090.785">__Oron__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2091.075" data-end_ts="2091.355" title="2091.075" id=c_"2091.075">__mainly__</span>, mainly <span style="color:red" data-ts="2091.865" data-end_ts="2092.155" title="2091.865" id=c_"2091.865">__Oron__</span> and, and also you <span style="color:red" data-ts="2093.195" data-end_ts="2093.395" title="2093.195" id=c_"2093.195">__not__</span>, that kind of did this shift in the way I kind of thought about my future and about what I wanna do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see. That's, that's really interesting. Now, one of the things I noticed in looking at the different descriptions of your work is that a big part of what you do is sort of like a masterful gathering of a team, right? <laugh>, you know, you talked about it in, in terms of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2119.755" data-end_ts="2120.035" title="2119.755" id=c_"2119.755">__cell__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2120.115" data-end_ts="2120.235" title="2120.115" id=c_"2120.115">__f__</span> but every one of your, bigger projects seems to have this orientation of bringing together kind of like the extreme scientist and kind of extreme artists or musicians or whatever, and helping each to bring their own kind of voice or concept into the project. Where is, what is the part of that that makes up your voice? Is it, is it this being the glue of collaboration? Or is, or do you have, are you working with them to help expand your voice into their area? Do you know what I'm saying? Are, do you find yourself playing coordinator, or do you find yourself doing collaborations with everybody? How does that really work? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Guy: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2172.285" data-end_ts="2172.405" title="2172.285" id=c_"2172.285">__I__</span>, I, I understand. I understand exactly what you're asking. And, thank you for asking that because, I failed to talk about it before. Collaboration is a very important part of my work. And, you know, one of the reasons that I, collaborate is that I, the projects that I usually aim to develop are quite complex. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, they're quite big. And there's just so much that I can do or know how to do. So usually those teams that I kind of build or those, the collaborations that I kind of form are mainly due to the fact that, I dunno why, but I always think big. I always want to kind of create those projects that are quite complex. I mean, I'm basically shooting myself in the foot, you know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Guy: </b>The development of those projects are quite complicated. And, you know, usually takes me four years or three years. And when I, when I started to work on self, I was very cautious about that. It's my self portrait, and I decided that I'm just gonna do it myself. Right. But then the things that I can do are quite limiting. <laugh>. I wanted to do way more than that. I wanted the project to go to different directions, and I understood that unless I collaborate, I would never produce the project that I wanna produce. Sure. So, really the reason, that I, work in those collaborative projects is, is this the same <span style="color:red" data-ts="2267.965" data-end_ts="2268.185" title="2267.965" id=c_"2267.965">__or__</span> this, this idea of interdisciplinary research, the idea that we can't do everything we need to work with other people in order to kind of create complex projects. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And then I also really <span style="color:red" data-ts="2281.145" data-end_ts="2281.505" title="2281.145" id=c_"2281.145">__enjoyed__</span>, you know, because I think that the, the collaborative vibe or the, the people that I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2287.065" data-end_ts="2287.265" title="2287.065" id=c_"2287.065">__work__</span> with, especially in <span style="color:red" data-ts="2289.045" data-end_ts="2289.465" title="2289.045" id=c_"2289.045">__itself__</span>, for instance, they, they made the project way better than I could ever dream of. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Guy: </b>The ideas started to flow from Darren, from Andrew, from Nathan Thompson. That is, I'm working very <span style="color:red" data-ts="2299.945" data-end_ts="2300.145" title="2299.945" id=c_"2299.945">__close__</span> with on a new project. Well, we collaborate on a new project of, of that we kind of thought about together. The scientists, you know, I mean, it was quite an amazing, process of developing this project itself. Because we were a big team and, you know, there was no real kind of problems with ego or, who is doing what. You know, we all kind of, it all kind of, we all fell, fell into our kind of beat that we know how to, and we worked very well together to produce a project that I could never dream of doing myself. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. When we take a look at some of these collaborators, I think actually a lot of my listeners will know Andrew Fitch, who, is the person behind non-linear circuits. Right. His work with creating sort of, chaotic electronic music tooling is pretty well known. But, you know, you're working with other people like, scientists in, in, biological research. How do you even get people to have a common vocabulary? What kind of glossary do you have to build so that people can talk to one another? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Guy: </b>Well, that's the ethos in SymbioticA. You know, we work with scientists and we work with with artists. Ah, and, I've been working, I'm an artist that's been working in Scientific labs for 20 years now. Right. Nathan Thompson. He's a resident in SymbioticA currently as well. As I said, we're developing a project together. Andrew, you know, he lives in Perth. He started to show up in SymbioticA as well. You know, we had quite a lot of meetings. I mean, this is what's so special about, SymbioticA that the language is becoming the scientific language from one side, but the artistic, vocabulary from the other side are starting to be become very familiar. Right. Dr. Stewart budgets, for instance, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2417.305" data-end_ts="2417.525" title="2417.305" id=c_"2417.305">__per__</span> person that, one of the scientists that we're working with, he's been collaborating on dozens and dozens of artistic projects. When you hear him talk, you know, he may sound like an artist sometimes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Guy: </b>He claims that I sound like a scientist. <laugh>, you know, we always have this kind of, conversation. Douglas Buckham, another one of, self elaborator. He was a PhD student in the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2441.795" data-end_ts="2442.085" title="2441.795" id=c_"2441.795">__Port__</span> lab, and he was the person that helped me develop, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2447.115" data-end_ts="2447.405" title="2447.115" id=c_"2447.115">__Miar__</span> this first project that I was talking about. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And he was such a great person to work with. And through the years, once he kind of graduated, he said, listen, I don't wanna be sucked into one of those projects again. I'm going and developing my own career. And then every couple of years I would kind of send him an email and saying, are you free to work with me now <laugh>? 'cause he's a brilliant, he's a brilliant <span style="color:red" data-ts="2468.805" data-end_ts="2469.085" title="2468.805" id=c_"2468.805">__neuro__</span> neuro engineer. Okay. And then I was really lucky that a couple of months before, so he sent me an email. I said, okay, I do have the time now and the capacity. Let's do it. And, you know, straight away he joined the, the project. So, you know, he's been working on, artistic projects for, for 10 years as well. Right. But it, it is this kind of, space in SymboticA that allows this kind of, interaction between, those, you know, people talking about fertilization of those cultures, the science and the art. I'm more talking about the contamination, and that's where it becomes fun. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Man, I'm looking at the clock and already our time is done, and I've got questions ranging from how it is that, you know, you're able to reprogram. I mean, you talked about this idea of reprogramming cells in the stem cells. It makes my head wanna blow up. I don't even understand exactly what that means, but it sounds amazing. I, I wish I could explore more. I mean, I am gonna ask you this, what is it about Perth that's making, I mean, like I said, my original introduction to you came from somebody that said, Hey, there's some stuff happening here in Perth you might want to take a look at. And I started looking into it. And, you know, with the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2557.245" data-end_ts="2557.365" title="2557.245" id=c_"2557.245">__c__</span> Lombard, modular systems coming out of there, the work that non-linear circuits is doing, the stuff with coming outta SymbioticA and your work in particular, what is it about Perth that is generating this kind of stuff? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Guy: </b>Well, I don't know. It's, it's really easy to work here. The lifestyle is quite high. And, you know, when I started, when I moved here, it was actually really cheap to live here. I mean, not anymore. But, as far as biological arts, I think, you know, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2590.685" data-end_ts="2590.805" title="2590.685" id=c_"2590.685">__it__</span>, it's, it's a very easy place to live where people have time to kind of do their own thing. You know? It's, or the director of Symbiotic or Katz always kind of says that, you know, he doesn't think that SymbioticA could happen anywhere else. It's only in Perth where it was this hotshot scientist that Oran approached. And rather than kind of looking and saying, Hey, are you a scientist? I don't have a lot of time right now. I can't teach you anything. He said, well, this is my lab. Right. And you're welcome to come here and work whenever you want. And, you know, this is how the seed for symbiotic can kind of start for, or, so I don't know. I think that the isolation may be, one of those reasons. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. I was wondering about that. If the isolation doesn't offer the opportunity to sort of like, develop your own cultural norm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Guy: </b>Yeah, I, I think so. I, I strongly, believe in that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, guy, I am. What a fascinating talk. I hope that the listeners will go onto your site and take a look at the work. I mean, it is pretty shocking and amazing and it, it really does what you set out to do, which is make you start thinking about what is life, what is thought, what is consciousness, what is reaction, what are all of these things? It, it really does push that envelope of questioning. And, I have to thank you for that because I have to tell you that it, it caused me to ask myself questions I'd long, ignored. So fabulous work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Guy: </b>Thank you very much. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So with that, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to, we're gonna have to stop for now, but I hope that we'll get a chance to talk again soon and, further discuss some of this stuff. 'cause it is amazing. Before I do let you go though, tell me a little bit, you said that it takes you years to, to develop these, these projects. Are you working, are you still kind of like, trying to finish up development on self or are you starting to work on a next project? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Guy: </b>So, no self is done. We're not further developing it and Okay. We are performing with self now. So I see, there's a, we, we are having a, there's a two performances in today's art, festival in, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2749.025" data-end_ts="2749.245" title="2749.025" id=c_"2749.025">__de__</span> Hague in September. And then we're going with it to Helsinki for a couple of performances with <span style="color:red" data-ts="2756.285" data-end_ts="2756.485" title="2756.285" id=c_"2756.285">__the__</span> Bio <span style="color:red" data-ts="2756.745" data-end_ts="2756.965" title="2756.745" id=c_"2756.745">__Art__</span> Society. And you know, we're kind of fully booked until 2021, mainly in Europe. And while, we are performing <span style="color:red" data-ts="2765.265" data-end_ts="2765.685" title="2765.265" id=c_"2765.265">__myself__</span>, Nate and Thompson and I are collaborating, to develop a new project called <span style="color:red" data-ts="2771.215" data-end_ts="2771.565" title="2771.215" id=c_"2771.215">__Brick__</span> Collage. And really in one, one liner <span style="color:red" data-ts="2775.105" data-end_ts="2775.325" title="2775.105" id=c_"2775.105">__is__</span>, what we are trying to do is we are trying to, this time, this project doesn't involve neurons. First time after such a long time for me, we are trying to grow, cardiomyocytes. So basically heart muscle cells on various kind of scaffolds, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2793.355" data-end_ts="2793.645" title="2793.355" id=c_"2793.355">__mini__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2793.695" data-end_ts="2794.045" title="2793.695" id=c_"2793.695">__minor__</span>, miniature scaffolds that we are, developing to produce artistic, autonomous, biological robots that are powered by the movement of the cardiomyocytes, the heart muscle cells over the structures.

<b>Guy: </b>And, the idea there is that we, those sculptures or those structures that we, or biological robots are going to self-assemble through, the exhibition. So we're gonna have many of them that are gonna self-assemble to one big one. But the movement of those, what behavior, the autonomous behavior of those biological robots are going to be defined in the direct, or yeah. The behavior is gonna be determined by the movement of the heart muscle cells on the structure. Because when you grow, this is what's interesting about heart muscle cells. When you grow them in tissue culture outside of the body as opposed to other type of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2849.685" data-end_ts="2849.965" title="2849.685" id=c_"2849.685">__cells__</span> they contract, they just kind of, they beat, they, they twitch right? Continuously. So we are trying to, use those inherent properties of those cells and grow them in masses over, really small structures to create those, robots. So this project is less about data and the kind of, manifestation or sonification of the data through movement or sound, but more about the visceral behavior of this biological material.

<b>Darwin: </b>Very interesting. Very interesting. Well look forward to seeing that in action as well. With that, I want to, thank you. I will let you have the rest of your day, but I want to thank you for taking the time outta your schedule to have this chat. It was really fascinating. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Guy: </b>Thank you for having me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright. And with that we'll say goodbye. Bye now. See 
</p>

<p>
<b>Guy: </b>Ya. Bye-Bye bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thanks so much everyone for listening. I hope you really enjoyed this. If you have a chance, check out the cell f he calls it self, I call it cell F project. It's crazy. The address is in the show notes. Otherwise, check in next week. We're gonna have more great stuff coming around the, around the pipe. And in the meantime, have a good summer catch next time around.
