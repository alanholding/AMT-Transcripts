<b>Darwin: </b>Hey, welcome to this week's podcast. Just a quick note during the course of this interview, you're <span style="color:red" data-ts="9.525" data-end_ts="9.645" title="9.525" id=c_"9.525">__gonna__</span> hear some slopping around in the background. Apologize for that, and definitely no disrespect to Arian, but, it's hard to get these guys to come in and get work done around the house. So sorry about that. I hope you enjoy this and, I'll talk to you <span style="color:red" data-ts="25.005" data-end_ts="25.125" title="25.005" id=c_"25.005">__on__</span> the backside 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>This week. I have the great pleasure of talking to somebody who I've spent a little time with in the past, but who has done some amazing work. His name's Arian Vander <span style="color:red" data-ts="40.085" data-end_ts="40.325" title="40.085" id=c_"40.085">__Shoot__</span>. He's the man behind, the company Audio Ease, whose main products are Alta Verb and speakerphone. And, both of these are really incredible pieces of software, but for me, Alta Verb was the first piece of software that really made me think that, hey, this computer audio thing might actually have some legs <laugh>. Because it, it sounded, <span style="color:red" data-ts="66.115" data-end_ts="66.405" title="66.115" id=c_"66.115">__well__</span>, the first time I heard it, it sounded beautiful and I was blown away. So, with that, I want to say hi to Arian. Arian. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen van der Schoot: </b>Hi, Darwin Nice to talk to you. Yeah, I'm, I'm doing great. I, most of my day is now behind me, so I'm just sitting down with you to, kind of wrap it 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Up. Yeah. Well, it's, thanks for taking the time to do this. I know you're a busy guy, but, I appreciate you giving us the opportunity to talk with you a little bit. Why don't we kick off by talking a little bit about, about your products. So, Alta Verb has been around since I think 2002. Is that correct? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>Something like that. 2001, I think actually 2001. Okay. It was, we were just, when we spoke a little bit earlier, you, had a recollection of a meeting that we had, that must have been in 2001, I think. Oh, that's right. That's, I think that was the a s show where we introduced it. And that was the a <span style="color:red" data-ts="120.325" data-end_ts="120.365" title="120.325" id=c_"120.325">__s__</span> show that was postponed because of nine 11, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? That's right, yeah. And then speakerphone. When did that come out? That was like 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>2008, I think. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>2008. Okay. Now, both of these, are really dependent on, like, modeling the real world in software, and, and I think that's what the first time I really heard it in action and working in real time, I was kind of blown away because it was, it seemed impossible to imagine that kind of thing happening. I'm curious, what is the background that, that got you to the point of being able to develop software that did this? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>Well, of course, by now the, the actual process that is called Convolution is pretty well known. And, we are by far no more the only ones that do it. But for a couple of years, yes, we were, we seem to be at least the only ones doing convolution on the desktop for a while in real time. Right. But products like, like, c Sound and Sound <span style="color:red" data-ts="185.675" data-end_ts="185.965" title="185.675" id=c_"185.675">__Hack__</span> already had, algorithms in place. You could do this with, with computer music software, basically. So we knew it from there a little bit. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> the convolution process. And also we did Convolutions that were shorter, which you use for filtering, basic filtering. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>And, we knew that there was a, the promise of, being able to apply acoustics to any sound with, with convolution, we just couldn't really imagine how realistic it would sound because we hadn't actually heard it ever. And then a box came along called, Sony DRES <span style="color:red" data-ts="225.885" data-end_ts="226.885" title="225.885" id=c_"225.885">__7 77__</span>. Right. It had a walnut front, I think, and a big shiny knob <laugh>, and, yeah, it looked really like a sedan dashboard or something. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>And, you could slide <span style="color:red" data-ts="240.165" data-end_ts="240.285" title="240.165" id=c_"240.165">__a__</span> CD rom in there, with, with sounds on it, and it just sounded incredibly lifelike. I wouldn't be, actually, I wouldn't actually be able to say good to me, sound good, because, sometimes you good is described, it's very hard to, to, label something as good. It's al it's always very fitting for a certain purpose. Right, right. But this seemed to fit the purpose of sounding absolutely lifelike, stunningly lifelike, I thought the Sony DRE did. And, then we screwed <span style="color:red" data-ts="277.125" data-end_ts="277.325" title="277.125" id=c_"277.125">__the__</span> box open to look inside, and from top to bottom it was filled with dedicated DSP hardware. And so we kind of lost interest right off the bat trying to, trying to do this, trying to pull this off on a, on a desktop computer. So this, this must have been 2000 somewhere, actually 1999. Okay. Because we spent quite a while before we actually got to introduce it at the Nam show. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So where, where were you at this time? Were you in university or were you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>Well, we are, we are still a bunch of music technology graduates from, Ure School of Arts. Ah, okay. Alright. So yeah, we did study together, and actually when we did study together, we found, we had, when we were nearing the end of our study, we were, like four or five people, that were, doing some software stuff. And we kind of were the only ones in our, in that subject. And we thought we either split up after this, and then we will probably either have to go to Hamburg or San Francisco where stuff was, going where, where actual actual music software was being developed. Right. Or we stay home and we try it. This was way earlier, this was 94. Okay. 93, something like that. Okay. And, so yeah, we, we as music technology students, in <span style="color:red" data-ts="370.905" data-end_ts="371.125" title="370.905" id=c_"370.905">__re__</span> we, just <span style="color:red" data-ts="372.625" data-end_ts="372.845" title="372.625" id=c_"372.625">__try__</span> did, some sort of a trial project together and, started, selling that and people, that was just when, people started to get internet connections in the Netherlands. And, so we were able to sell that to the other side of the world via, well, you know, via the internet, which now, of course is obvious, but back then it <span style="color:red" data-ts="397.565" data-end_ts="397.685" title="397.565" id=c_"397.565">__was__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It, it was not obvious. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>It seemed totally incredible even to receive information via the internet. Right. Because a couple years earlier, like 89, I had written a letter to Apple Computer to from them obtain the file format description for an A IFF file, a sound file <laugh>, and six weeks later I got, like three a fours in a binder and, it, it described the whole thing and I didn't have to reverse engineer it. Right. Which was wonderful. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>It actually showed me how the sample rate was stored, which was a weird number. Right. And, it was like <span style="color:red" data-ts="439.585" data-end_ts="439.805" title="439.585" id=c_"439.585">__co__</span> it was like some sort of a cryptic code. But, yeah, that, that, that was my background in music software, basically. That's the way I obtained my information. I went to a library, read the Computer music journal, wrote letters to Apple. Yeah. And then by the time we finished our first project, we got to actually sell it. It was Barbara <span style="color:red" data-ts="462.385" data-end_ts="462.605" title="462.385" id=c_"462.385">__Ra__</span> by the way. It's, it's still, we still sell that. Yeah. And, it was picked up by, electronic Arts right away. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> to, for their game, production, I presume. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="473.595" data-end_ts="473.885" title="473.595" id=c_"473.595">__Yeah__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You have some responsibility in changing the way that I heard music. Prior to using one of your bits of software, I did things that was kind of like sometimes poppy, sometimes techy, but pretty straightforward sound design wise. And then I ran across this little program, thunk zero two 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And I was like, oh, okay. It takes an audio file and does something. So I fed an audio file and watching it move, it was clear that I needed to come back two days later. Yep. So I came back two days later and I had this hour <span style="color:red" data-ts="519.595" data-end_ts="519.885" title="519.595" id=c_"519.595">__long__</span> file that just twisted my head up. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>You must have had a pretty good computer for it to render an hour in two days. <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>Well, back then, it took me a week to do that <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, yeah. Well, maybe I'm exaggerating a little bit bit, but not much. I just remember it being this long form piece and just being floored by the detail. I'd never really encountered, granular stretching stuff like that before. And it twists my head and I never, I never thought of sound design in the same way again. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>So do you think it helped that you had to wait for two days? Did it, did it make you pay more attention to that hour? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, certainly. So, and, I think so, it, I mean, because if nothing else, I, I would find a way to use the right parts. And so in a way, having an hour's worth of material was great because I could comb through it and find little bits and pieces that were exceptional. Right. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, and because of the way it worked, there would be these little kind little micro phrases and stuff that <span style="color:red" data-ts="591.325" data-end_ts="591.525" title="591.325" id=c_"591.325">__kind__</span> would kind of weave its way through the sound. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and finding those, it was, it was like treasure hunting. It was, so <span style="color:red" data-ts="598.405" data-end_ts="598.525" title="598.405" id=c_"598.405">__far__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>It is. And it, it has a direct connection to, to verb also to the story I told just a minute earlier about getting the <span style="color:red" data-ts="607.045" data-end_ts="607.165" title="607.045" id=c_"607.045">__A__</span> IFF because the thing you opened was an A-I-F-A-I-F-F file, I'm pretty sure. Right. Because that was, this was the project that I could do after I got the spec from, from Apple <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, very interesting. But, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>But, the complexity in thunk was, was given to me by the complexity of your input audio. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, and I didn't have to actually, my algorithms that ran over that file and chopped it to pieces and put it together in big streams, those would sound pretty straightforward when you feed it like a synthesizer tone, a steady synthesizer tone. Right. But the fact that it ran back and forth in the sound that you fed, it gave me all the complexity of your sound. So I actually, I think what I did was exploit the complexity of your input. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>And then take the credit for it <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>And that, and the connection with Alti verb is that I'm, I, right now, I'm doing exactly the same thing. I really don't have to understand the acoustics of these halls while all my competitors are trying to build, synthesize reverb from the ground up and probably know a lot about it too. Right. I, I can just afford to play completely dumb <laugh> and, and take the, and just take the thing and put it in a box and, and thrive on the complexity of the real world. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I think that that's actually an interesting kind of direction because I mean, certainly one of the things that I ended up finding, where it's really great with thunk was using, was using vocal samples. Right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, because there, by default, there's a lot of complexity. You can never actually hold a tone or anything. So, the, the constant changes seem to be rewarded in the, in the end result. Yeah. Now, similarly as you speak, the speak of it, the convolution, the way convolution works is kind of similar. You're, you're sort of like taking advantage, but, and I'm trying to remember what year it was that I saw in <span style="color:red" data-ts="734.845" data-end_ts="734.965" title="734.845" id=c_"734.845">__a__</span>, for a while there you started getting competition for other companies that were doing IR based, stuff, but you were also then the first to sort of be able to do real <span style="color:red" data-ts="745.765" data-end_ts="746.005" title="745.765" id=c_"745.765">__time__</span> tweaks to the convolution as well. I remember, I, I saw one again, it was probably at a NAMM show some number of years ago where all of a sudden I came by and, and you guys were there and I saw you be able to adjust the decay time. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> in, in real time. And it was like, oh man, that's the next cool thing. Right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And so at some point you have to sort of, like, you, you had to make some decisions about how, how you were going to imply your own control over the system. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>Right. I think we, in verb and, we are, we are trying to limit that to a, like a minimum because, it is also rather easy to, basically screw up the original sound too much to divert too far from the original sound. Sure. I think somewhere down the line, we may do something where we allow you to go a lot further, but, verb, I think basically the beauty of verb is you pick a room and that's, and if you, if you like it shorter, <span style="color:red" data-ts="821.275" data-end_ts="821.565" title="821.275" id=c_"821.275">__then__</span> there is this big knob, but me, myself, I like to go to another room, <laugh>. Right. But of course, but of course I, I know pretty much all the rooms because I, I've been there to record them. And, therefore I, I have kind of an idea which one would, would fit a certain purpose. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So now that opens the door to the next thing, which is recording in these rooms. First of all, can you explain a little bit of what that process is? <span style="color:red" data-ts="850.245" data-end_ts="850.725" title="850.245" id=c_"850.245">__Alright__</span>. First of all, how much manipulation does it take just to be allowed to go and record a room? You know, if you're going into a cathedral, what does it take <span style="color:red" data-ts="859.425" data-end_ts="859.645" title="859.425" id=c_"859.425">__to__</span>, like, do you have to talk to the Pope <laugh>? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>Well, <span style="color:red" data-ts="863.145" data-end_ts="863.365" title="863.145" id=c_"863.145">__so__</span>, you know, as long as it's a Catholic place, it's, it's rather easy to go to get in <laugh>, really, everybody that marries or gets buried. Yeah. It's, it's, it's quite easy to contact the church and then ask to do something remotely cultural. Oh, archeological, pho photographical. Yeah. I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Didn't even, I didn't even think about sort of like the historical nature of this, but of course. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>Yeah. And, these churches are basically public places and lots of people have purposes for these churches that, that are, well, not completely based, have any, anything to do with, with religion. Yeah. They are normally open to just give them a little money and, they're for rent. These places are in the centers of the most beautiful cities of, of the world, but they're always for rent for a decent amount of money. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, that's interesting. So, what is the process? What kind of equipment does it take to do a great job of this? And especially in your case where you have a lot of tweak <span style="color:red" data-ts="929.925" data-end_ts="930.325" title="929.925" id=c_"929.925">__ability__</span> after the fact with the sound, are you doing a lot of multi microphone recording, and how do you coordinate that part of it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>Well, we've, we've been through a number of, like, incarnations of our setup, but the thing, that we have kept consistent is, the speaker that we use to play back what, what we call our stimulus or our impulse. Okay. Which in our case is a sweep <span style="color:red" data-ts="959.835" data-end_ts="960.125" title="959.835" id=c_"959.835">__tone__</span>, a sign wave sweep that goes up from, from, somewhere between five and 10 hertz, all the way up to 24 kilohertz, basically. That's what we, we played back via, via speaker. And that speaker has remained quite steady over the years. And then on the other end, we recorded with microphones. And those microphones are a key component too. All the other components hardly seem to matter in, in the whole process. And that's because, the thing we're doing, maybe I should explain that, if you allow me, a little bit of the algorithm that is convolution, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Please do. Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>Yeah. When you, when you would zoom in on your own recording, your <span style="color:red" data-ts="1012.665" data-end_ts="1012.885" title="1012.665" id=c_"1012.665">__dry__</span> recording of a singer, for instance, because this is a, this is a reverb thing, so we add acoustics, right? So you will put in a dry sound, if you would zoom in on that, you would see that, what is seemingly a kind of a, a continuous waveform is actually some sort of a stepped line with, with horizontal stepped, steps of, when you zoom in far enough, you see the individual samples, you see that they are really steps. Right. And, these underlying, these steps are spikes. It basically is a spike train, a train of spikes, which you're looking at on a cd, 44,000 and a hundred pass each, each second. And, and then, all these, spikes have a different level. And along the top you see this waveform. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>So basically every dry sound consists, consists of 44,000 spikes. And all these spikes sound identical. Only one is louder than the other. And sometimes their sign is flipped. So sometimes one is pointing down and the other one is pointing up in this waveform. Right? Right. <laugh>. Now if you have, dissected your dry audio into 44,000 identical sounds that only differ in volume, then basically you need to response of any system to only one of those spikes to apply that to every one of those spikes, of course, in balance, so at the proper volume. So if the spike is low, you put it in low mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, and then you get, a, a waveform that sounds exactly like it's been played back through that system. And in my case, that system is, the acoustics of a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1134.605" data-end_ts="1134.845" title="1134.605" id=c_"1134.605">__hall__</span>. Wow. So basically, I'm replacing each of those spikes by a spike with a complete tail that could last for 11 seconds in the case of a church. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>So you can see that if I have to replace each spike by 11 seconds of spikes, which is 11 times 44,000, then that's a lot of work, because I'm gonna have to mix in the next spike as well. Right. This is a description in the time domain. We do it in the frequency domain, which, where it is, where it is a complex multiplication of four <span style="color:red" data-ts="1172.805" data-end_ts="1172.925" title="1172.805" id=c_"1172.805">__a__</span> spectra. And, but mathematically it's the same result. It's just less mathematic, less, calculations. Now, to get back to the, to the recording of it, we, so what we need from that church is the response of the church to a spike. So ideally, we would be playing back a spike there, which sounds like something like what your nails would do if you had just made the sound. You heard a spike via Skype, which is a nice sentence to begin with. <laugh>. Anyway, a spike, playing back a spike. We've tried that first, and lots of people still do acousticians pop balloons. They fire starter pistols <span style="color:red" data-ts="1219.985" data-end_ts="1220.205" title="1219.985" id=c_"1219.985">__in__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1220.205" data-end_ts="1220.285" title="1220.205" id=c_"1220.205">__Off__</span> fire starter pistols. Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1221.285" data-end_ts="1221.525" title="1221.285" id=c_"1221.285">__Yeah__</span>. That's the one I'm familiar with. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1223.125" data-end_ts="1223.285" title="1223.125" id=c_"1223.125">__You__</span> get, yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1223.955" data-end_ts="1224.245" title="1223.955" id=c_"1223.955">__Just__</span> to, make something that resembles a spike. But most of these banks are very hard to control. So the one bang sounds different from the other bank, for instance. So, and also they are often very narrow <span style="color:red" data-ts="1239.235" data-end_ts="1239.525" title="1239.235" id=c_"1239.235">__band__</span>, so they lack low and high frequencies, for instance, the process that we are using is called exponential sine wave sweeping, which is a sweep tone that lasts in our case most of the time for about 30 seconds. And it goes up from 10 to 24,000 hertz. And, so we record that sweep tone in that church with all its, reverb behind it. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1268.065" data-end_ts="1268.285" title="1268.065" id=c_"1268.065">__So__</span> we get a sweep with reverb, and then mathematically we put that sweep sort of upright to become a spike again. So all the energy that we released in that church during 30 seconds of sweeping gets compressed into a single sample. Oh. So now we are combining the energy that we put into the church of 30 times 44,000 samples into a single one. That's why we can get ridiculous signal to noise ratio. Right. Something that's never possible with a tiny speaker that we use, because even though we use 12 inch roofs, it is still a ridiculously small piece of equipment compared to the church. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>And, but, but it's like, we can blow up this speaker, the power of this speaker in this church so enormously that we push down the, the environmental noise so that we can get like 120 DB of signal to noise. Stuff like that is, is not uncommon in, in our recordings. This is also why I mentioned that some of the gear, it doesn't really matter. Of course, every bit of noise that we can get rid of is nice, but, if you're, if you're sweeping for 30 seconds, then for instance, the noise that your recorded inputs generate is hardly ever an issue. You're gonna push that all the way down. Right. It's gonna be gone right from this particular type recording. So we can get away with sometimes using pretty small, mobile recorders that are typically used in, for instance, post-production audio. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> or actually, production sound, audio. So, the, the recorder that, that, the guy with the boom uses. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>We use equipment like that to record this sweep. Normally we use four microphones simultaneously. We use omnidirectional microphones because we're interested in the reflections from all the walls and the ceilings and the, so reflections come from everywhere. So we wanna grab that without trying to filter out what's coming from behind, for instance. So normally we use omnidirectional microphones. As soon as you want to, record something with omnidirectional microphones that is in stereo or quad, you need to space them apart. So right off the bat, we're stuck to, spaced omnidirectional microphone systems, and, that's what we've been using right from the start. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see. How consistent has, has the microphones and the speakers been over the years, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>The four microphones that make the corners of the surround <span style="color:red" data-ts="1432.605" data-end_ts="1432.925" title="1432.605" id=c_"1432.605">__system__</span>. So when you're using five or 5.1 or four mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, then you have a left and a right, left surround, and a right surround. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, those have been, the same microphones <span style="color:red" data-ts="1443.005" data-end_ts="1443.245" title="1443.005" id=c_"1443.005">__right__</span> from the start. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>Yeah. And we went through a couple of speakers. The ones that we <span style="color:red" data-ts="1449.685" data-end_ts="1449.725" title="1449.685" id=c_"1449.685">__are__</span> now using have also been with us for, for about eight years. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, okay. Now, one of the things you mentioned was that when you do this sweep, you start at like five or sometimes 10 hertz and go up to 24 kilohertz. So conceivably, scientifically you are going from below the audible spectrum to well above it. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, do you do that so that you excite the space properly? Or do you find that that gives you more flexibility with the swept tone? What's, what, why do you use such a wide range? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>Whatever you put into al verb, when the, when you load up an impulse response that I recorded, I must have, put that in the hall first. So if my sweep would run from a thousand herts to 5,000 hertz only, then nothing, outside that band would come out of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1503.485" data-end_ts="1503.645" title="1503.485" id=c_"1503.485">__verb__</span> either. I see. So I would, I would basically be band limiting your input audio. So, because I do not know what the frequencies, fre frequencies are that you put into it, and, with your and Gregory's type of music, you can put basically any, any frequency in there. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Indeed. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>You've been in the five <span style="color:red" data-ts="1524.325" data-end_ts="1524.565" title="1524.325" id=c_"1524.325">__first__</span> region, and maybe you've put some else verb behind it, you'd be really surprised if the reverb suddenly stopped there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Good point. Right? Yeah. Now, how many different places have you done, impulse responses on? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>I really don't know, but, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1543.065" data-end_ts="1543.285" title="1543.065" id=c_"1543.065">__but__</span>, many hundreds. Right. And, but of course you have to divide them in sort of categories. I mean, to give you an, an impression, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1556.035" data-end_ts="1556.325" title="1556.035" id=c_"1556.035">__Mbba__</span> of India took me two years of negotiating to get into. And on the other hand, I did my own house. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>Which in which case I had like eight rooms in one and a half hours. <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. There you go. Well, it's, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>That's course for post. So it's maybe not, not, I, I don't really like to count because I, if I do, I would like to count to go <span style="color:red" data-ts="1580.195" data-end_ts="1580.485" title="1580.195" id=c_"1580.195">__goba__</span>, like triple 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Right? Sure. Absolutely. For me, I love the beautiful cathedrals and stuff that you'd done, because the music I like doing really benefits from those big, beautiful, smooth rooms. Right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But, I have a really good friend who works in post-production, and they're like, oh yeah, we slap alt verb on everything. I'm like, really? You know, and I'm thinking like, why do you need cathedrals on everything? And they're like, oh, no, we have to do it on everything because we have the interior of a car. And so when everybody's inside of a car, we use Alta verb on everybody to be inside of a car or whatever. Yeah. And it's funny because I never really thought of it in that way, but that probably is a primary use for that software. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>It is. For, in the case of verb, it's, it's defin definitely a, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1632.325" data-end_ts="1632.445" title="1632.325" id=c_"1632.325">__a__</span> number wise, it's a large chunk of the, of the, of our audience. Yes, sure. People, people post. And that's why, we go to very strange places, as well. So, because, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So what, what's the strangest <span style="color:red" data-ts="1646.845" data-end_ts="1647.045" title="1646.845" id=c_"1646.845">__pa__</span> place, or what are some of the strangest places you've done? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>Outdoor spaces are, are sometimes really strange. I mean, to be able to actually try and record at night in a forest, and not waking up too much wildlife <laugh> and not getting in trouble with, with, the authorities there because I'm making a lot of noise when I, when I go outside. So I have to be away from the people. And right now I'm staring to probably where you are sitting, because you, you sent me a link to where your place is in the Rocky Mountains, and I'm looking at that and I think, you know, that wouldn't be a problem recording out there, <laugh>. It's probably rather, rather silent. And I'm probably not waking up too many people when I do that at night. Right. Not, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Not many <span style="color:red" data-ts="1696.365" data-end_ts="1696.645" title="1696.365" id=c_"1696.365">__years__</span> in the neighborhood. That's true. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>Yeah. Outdoor is, is really strange. And, but I also went inside, a fruit juice tank, a 30,000 liter fruit juice tank. We recorded inside the real of a pipe laying vessel. The reel had a spectacular, very long metallic reverb. So, somebody just alerted us to it. That's what happens, you know, if you are around for a number of years, like we are, and some people are stunned by the acoustics of, I don't know, maybe, the inside of a machine room in a ship or something like that. Sure. And they, they hear something spectacular. Then work gets around a little bit around the guy that finds it spectacular, and chances are that it'll reach somebody that knows us and they'll send us an email, and then they say, you know, we have this pipe laying vessel here. You should come over and listen to this because it's ridiculous. And when it's totally ridiculous, I really wanna go there. You 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Wanna do it right? Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>Of course. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So have you ever had, did, does like James Cameron call you up and say, ah, you know, I really need, I really need the inside of an alien space vessel. Can you cook that up for me? <span style="color:red" data-ts="1776.905" data-end_ts="1777.125" title="1776.905" id=c_"1776.905">__Wow__</span>. Do you ever get any requests like that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>Definitely. But not from <span style="color:red" data-ts="1781.685" data-end_ts="1781.885" title="1781.685" id=c_"1781.685">__camera__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1781.945" data-end_ts="1782.165" title="1781.945" id=c_"1781.945">__on__</span> <laugh>? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>No, no. I guess, whatever name, but the guys that work for him, the guys that actually have to dial up that space when he's in a room sitting behind them and says, I want something spaceship, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1793.725" data-end_ts="1793.965" title="1793.725" id=c_"1793.725">__like__</span>, I guess it could work like that. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Then, yeah, those guys make sure that they're prepared and they, they do call us up and make samples. But the thing is, the funny thing is we also give them the opportunity to do it themselves, because the software comes with a method of making your own impulse responses. And that way you can, experiment yourself. And I think <span style="color:red" data-ts="1815.905" data-end_ts="1816.125" title="1815.905" id=c_"1815.905">__the__</span>, the bigger studios like to do samples themselves because they, well, you know, the, the, the, the big shots, the guy that, that get, the awards like, just the other month, Richard King, for instance. Right. Got one in December. Yes. He goes out and records impulse responses himself in the forests. And, that's because he can just, he knows what he's looking for. Exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and he can control the signature, then it becomes a signature of his. Right. It's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>His, it's his. That's nice. Of course. But he's willing to share stuff too. Hmm. But, the thing is he's after a particular sound, and he knows in real life where to get it. I see. So he goes out and records it, and I think that's what he's done with, like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1869.905" data-end_ts="1870.125" title="1869.905" id=c_"1869.905">__lit__</span> all the elements in his sound design. So why not with his reverb, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Of 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>Course. And, I, I really like that. So there's a multitude, there's a, of, of samples out there that we haven't made, and they are just keeping under their heads. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Right. So of all of the places that you've got to experience, so I, I I think it's one, oh, actually one of the things, one detail I wanted to ask about, doing the impulse responses. You talk about making a lot of noise. What DB level do you do this sweep at? How loud is it? Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>I like to do it at a, at a rather uncomfortable level. That's because, my speaker will pull it off. And when it's a pure <span style="color:red" data-ts="1921.075" data-end_ts="1921.365" title="1921.075" id=c_"1921.075">__sign__</span> tone, it is annoying very quickly, <laugh>, it's, it's just not a nice thing to look to, to, to hear one go up from 500 hertz to say, 3000 hertz, that's a really painful area. Uncomfortable. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>Uncomfortable area. And you know that it's gonna get worse when, when you hit 500 and it goes up, you know it's gonna get worse. Right. So, yeah. I do it at a level where it's uncomfortable because, I get best signal to noise ratio. Sure. Yeah. And, outdoors, I do it at a volume that is ridiculous. I use a different type speaker and, it's hurtful. I, I need, I need to use a speaker that is not a studio monitor outside. Okay. And, that means that it's not gonna be very well equalized. It's a PA type speaker. Right, right. So in order to measure what I need to do to correct that, because I can correct that after the fact with an inverse filtering trick. Sure. I put it in my studio and play as loud as I intend to do it outside and make a recording of that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>And it's an koic, place. So there is no, no, reverb in that studio. And, that, that is actually nauseatingly loud, but that's mainly because only a fraction of this, this audio that I'm projecting into space is going to be reflected to, to towards me, right back towards me. If I fire it towards some trees, for instance, then only the trunks will give me some audio back that is only like a, like a, a hundredth of a percent. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2025.905" data-end_ts="2026.125" title="2025.905" id=c_"2025.905">__Yes__</span>. Small fracture the hole. Yeah. And that's gonna travel a hundred meters up and down. So what, what I'm getting back is very little. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>And, to separate that from the amount of noise that is outdoor, I need to sweep both loud and long. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, how do you, when you're working outdoors, how do you deal with the environmental issues? So, like, I'm looking out here and, and while you're right, it wouldn't, it wouldn't bother too many people outside my front door to make the recording the howling wind and the trains going by. And, you know, I'm near Denver, so there's airport traffic all the time. How do you get away from both nature's noise, but the ever-present noise of humans? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>Humans? Well, the answer is Google Maps. I, I, study Google Maps <laugh> a lot. It's, for the past couple of months I've been, marking spots on the map that are both, I can travel to within a day. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and, while taking my gear, which means I get a drive there. So it's about a, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2094.125" data-end_ts="2094.245" title="2094.125" id=c_"2094.125">__a__</span>, an 800 kilometer radius around our studios. And, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2100.035" data-end_ts="2100.325" title="2100.035" id=c_"2100.035">__mark__</span> spots where very few people live, that are, that is far away from, highways and, and, water, because that makes sound Well water, of course. Yeah. And that have, interesting acoustic features. So they must, it must be, well, you know, you <span style="color:red" data-ts="2118.965" data-end_ts="2119.165" title="2118.965" id=c_"2118.965">__gotta__</span> hear something of a reverb there. And, I mark those spots and I also <span style="color:red" data-ts="2125.835" data-end_ts="2126.125" title="2125.835" id=c_"2125.835">__mark__</span> places that I can, stay in there. Like I go on Airbnb and, and kind of pre-book, little houses there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>Okay, sure. And then when the wind goes down enough and it's not raining, I hop in my car and I go over <laugh>. I see. But it's like that. But ba the best thing to do is actually to go out into a place where you live, for instance, drive around out to find nice acoustics. I do that with a megaphone, then know how to drive there in the dark and set up, and then, record when, when the conditions are Okay. Uhhuh <affirmative>. But it's, it's, it's a lot like hunting and fishing <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It must be enjoyable work to do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>I like it a lot. I like it a lot because, I get to go to pretty places. It's working. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2179.275" data-end_ts="2179.765" title="2179.275" id=c_"2179.275">__Outdoor__</span> is a bit exciting. It's just a bit scary when the thing is going, when the sweep is going and it's, and you know, it's gonna go on for another one and a half minute, like 90 seconds. That's rather long if you <span style="color:red" data-ts="2190.325" data-end_ts="2190.485" title="2190.325" id=c_"2190.325">__want__</span>, if you basically want to run. Right. And, you're just hoping you're not waking people up. It <span style="color:red" data-ts="2196.405" data-end_ts="2196.565" title="2196.405" id=c_"2196.405">__ju__</span> it used to be worse when we still used to, when we still used the starter pistols, and we would go into the forests at night and shoot our starter pistols. It would be scarier. Oh, I'll bet. 'cause, because, while that might be a rather normal thing at a Rocky Mountains, it's certainly not <span style="color:red" data-ts="2211.365" data-end_ts="2211.645" title="2211.365" id=c_"2211.365">__<inaudible>__</span>. So any pistol shot police will be there within minutes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Really? Oh, interesting. Yeah. Yeah. No, up, up here that hearing a pistol shot just means that you're excited, I think, or something. <laugh> <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>Anyway, so, but, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2226.665" data-end_ts="2226.885" title="2226.665" id=c_"2226.665">__but__</span> indoor too, indoor recordings too. They often require a lot of traveling and, arranging, because I do not like to travel with <span style="color:red" data-ts="2235.805" data-end_ts="2235.965" title="2235.805" id=c_"2235.805">__the__</span> speaker if I can avoid it. So I try to rent the same type speaker, somewhere, at the other end. And then, so, it takes a whole lot of, of arranging before I'm actually on a stage. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see. Sure. Of course. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>And I can start my sweep, and that's always what my <span style="color:red" data-ts="2256.565" data-end_ts="2256.805" title="2256.565" id=c_"2256.565">__trail__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2256.805" data-end_ts="2257.045" title="2256.805" id=c_"2256.805">__hold__</span> boils down to. I always give that same totally nihilistic little concert of 30 seconds without any <laugh> holding my breath a little bit, listening to my sweep and my own heartbeat, because I'm normally a little bit, I have run around doing cables and stuff. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>And, then when, when it's on there, I need <span style="color:red" data-ts="2280.605" data-end_ts="2280.765" title="2280.605" id=c_"2280.605">__an__</span>, a bunch more takes because there's more than one sound to a rule. I need more positions and more stuff like that. Okay. But then when I'm done after, say a half an hour, three quarters of an hour of sweeping normally, then, it's a wrap. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2296.685" data-end_ts="2296.805" title="2296.685" id=c_"2296.685">__I__</span>, I, I, I have exactly what I need and I can relax and have a beer and, and go home again. That's, and that's really nice. And then when I'm in my koic chamber, again, my studio without acoustics, I can bring back to life this recording. And, that is a thrilling moment because it's not only without, acoustics, it's also completely without light if I want it to be right. So, I sit there in the dark, listening to that same room <span style="color:red" data-ts="2328.945" data-end_ts="2329.165" title="2328.945" id=c_"2328.945">__is__</span>, which is wonderful because I went there <span style="color:red" data-ts="2331.105" data-end_ts="2331.325" title="2331.105" id=c_"2331.105">__in__</span> this place because it's a nice sounding room. And then to hear that happening around me in my studio again, is really fantastic. And then looking forward to bringing it out and getting some feedback on that from our clients that some of 'em will hopefully like it to. It's, yeah, it's really nice. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So one of the things I always like doing with people who, who develop stuff is ask them about favorites. Of all the things that you've done to this point, all the rooms that you shot or whatever, what is the favorite one that you ran across? What is the one that you look back and like, that was amazing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>Well, I think, all of 'em are, you probably know that when you install verb, you get a, you can, tick a box and then it also installs a screensaver. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2387.765" data-end_ts="2388.115" title="2387.765" id=c_"2387.765">__Right__</span>. It will basically, if you don't do fif something, anything for 15 minutes, then a screensaver kicks in and you just see this slideshow of rooms. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, and goes on and on. All the rooms come by. All those rooms have a little story, because I've been there recording it. Sometimes the story makes the room special, but I like it best if the sound makes a room special. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So I have, for instance, met Spectacular people. I am, living, with, the mother of my, second son. And, I met her on one of those sampling trips, to, Conza <span style="color:red" data-ts="2428.675" data-end_ts="2428.915" title="2428.675" id=c_"2428.675">__house__</span> in, Berlin, actually, Philharmonica, that's where I actually, where, where she worked with me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>So that's a spectacular room for me, <laugh>. But in fact, that room might not sound so, incredible compared to other rooms. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, the rooms that, that, that just sound absolutely gorgeous. Those are the ones that, that must be my favorite. And, one of 'em I haven't brought out yet, I made it just a, a month or two ago in New York, which is, Kaufman Astoria Studios, which is in Queens, actually, not in, Manhattan. And that's just, it's, it's like an orchestral studio, a little scoring stage, right? Not, so, not even, not even big. So big, but still, still a rather big live room, a recording studio room. And that sample just blew me away. I play back the same super <span style="color:red" data-ts="2485.735" data-end_ts="2485.955" title="2485.735" id=c_"2485.735">__dry__</span> drums that, Lance Crane once, sent me, play them in, in a room like that, just to try it out for the first time after I kind of developed the samples at home. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And it, it was just so, such a massively impressive sounding room. It is so enveloping and so bright all the way, down the impulse response. It's, it sounds gorgeous. And I like, I really like the size of that room as well. And very much the same as, SARM Studios in, SARM Studios in London. The Trevor Horns place that he abandoned. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, yeah. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>That's what, that's the room. Where do they know it's Christmas time was recorded? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>Okay. And, the medium rooms, those are the ones that are so universally applicable. It is. And, and those two, really stand out. So Sarm and, Kaufman Astoria, which we will probably be releasing in one or two months or so. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Very interesting. Now I wanna talk about speakerphone because where I have a long history, interacting with Alta Verb, I have never used speakerphone. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2561.835" data-end_ts="2562.325" title="2561.835" id=c_"2561.835">__Alright__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And, I'm not sure why, other than, you know, if I wanted to change the, the sense of what I was recording, that I would probably just find a way to do that with a convolution in something like Ulta Verb. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, what is the difference? What is it that makes speakerphone special? And why should I be paying attention to it? And why, you know, instead of not, I I should be, well, I feel like it because I've loved everything you've ever done. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So why, why haven't I engaged with this? I don't know, but tell me why I should, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>Maybe you shouldn't. <laugh> <laugh>, if you look at the demo movie on YouTube <span style="color:red" data-ts="2603.305" data-end_ts="2603.525" title="2603.305" id=c_"2603.305">__of__</span> speakerphone and you hear something you like, you should probably pick it up, and otherwise maybe you shouldn't. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, the, the speakerphone is a monster. It's physically, it's big on your screen, but what's in it is, is really huge. There is, we've crammed a lot of effects in there. And, it's not like, you, they're all there in one screen. It's not like you drag them on from a little library, like with, what, what you guys do with Max. Right? They're all there, always, always patched up. So it's like a modular synth wall or something. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>Only of effects. And the thing we did with speakerphone is, we knew that convolution was capable of doing more than reverb. Right? And this guy, a friend of ours, called <span style="color:red" data-ts="2652.625" data-end_ts="2652.845" title="2652.625" id=c_"2652.625">__Ana__</span>, had already shown it to us by releasing, samples of speakers and telephones and stuff like that. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, we went on with that. And through the years, we had acquired a massive amount of speakers and phones and buckets and stuff like that. Really tiny things that can also be emulated by, convolution. It just didn't make sense to have a reverb time with that and not a distortion. Right? So we needed this a distortion rather than a reverb time. So there was actually some discussion about putting a distortion into health verb, which would've been completely ridiculously Celiac looking back. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But, so we decided to spin that idea off and base it around modeling electroacoustic transducers, so microphones and speakers, and, then applying effects to them, nonlinear effects like distortions and compression, but also the crunching, the bit crunching that happens in telephones, aliasing sample <span style="color:red" data-ts="2717.205" data-end_ts="2717.485" title="2717.205" id=c_"2717.205">__eight__</span> converters, wow. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>And flutter of, vinyl and cassettes and, the effects of radio stations being just tuned next to the station. Stuff like, of course stereo delays for slap backs on, in, in station halls and stuff like that. It is, it is a whole bunch of effects that you can create presets with that go much further than al verb in offering realism. So you can make your sound really sound like it comes through a, a megaphone ceiling mounted, in a station, with the acoustics of that station. And you hear the compression and the distortion, but you can also hear the people walk by and the traffic outside, because all of that stuff is in speakerphone. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You do <span style="color:red" data-ts="2769.925" data-end_ts="2770.045" title="2769.925" id=c_"2769.925">__that__</span>. Okay. So now, so see, now you, you open the door for me and it also explains, so my friend Gregory, he is very into using speakerphone like constantly. He never explains to me why he uses it, but now I understand because you can take relatively <span style="color:red" data-ts="2789.625" data-end_ts="2789.845" title="2789.625" id=c_"2789.625">__oh__</span>, static sounds and it sounds like you could really sort of like activate them in many different ways. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>Yeah. It, I haven't, I haven't come across anything that goes as far in manipulating, your, your input sound so far. It's, the making the presets for that thing was, so, it was a kind of a daunting task because, you could go so many directions <span style="color:red" data-ts="2817.395" data-end_ts="2817.685" title="2817.395" id=c_"2817.395">__that__</span> could, this thing could live by itself, like a synthesizer there, there's LFOs in them and a sample playback bay and stuff like that. So you can just do stuff with that. But, but, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2829.945" data-end_ts="2830.165" title="2829.945" id=c_"2829.945">__to__</span> simple telephone voices and the guys in Post It, it really took off this product in, in film post. And because, because people were, they, the level of realism was raised and they could do it quicker, and people in film post like that, because the pressure is always on for them. Sure. And, so they could deliver faster, better, more realistic sounding stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>But the thing I also really liked is that, it was picked up by, music producers, because if you listen to, to hits of the past decade and, and still almost all the big hits have some sort of voice mangling in it as well. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So a little like little side, comment, commentary type, lines that, that, that sound through a megaphone or a telephone or a whole background phone call going, through, some sort of a guitar amp sound thing and stuff like that is also done with, with speakerphone just to make, to, to give more character, but not in a, not in like a, a tube warmth type character, but more in, let's make the voice sound like it's really through a telephone. Sure. But with <span style="color:red" data-ts="2911.765" data-end_ts="2911.885" title="2911.765" id=c_"2911.765">__a__</span>, with even the connection, dropping a little bit <laugh>, actually you sound pretty good, via Skype here, but, there are actually Skype presets in speakerphone to make something sound like it came through Skype <laugh>. Oh, stuff like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, sometimes I get those things where like elongates things and stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b><laugh> Exactly. That you can do with speakerphone. We've, we've been, we've done the research on the e <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's amazing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2942.205" data-end_ts="2942.365" title="2942.205" id=c_"2942.205">__Ian__</span>, we're, we're already well past the amount of time that, that I want to take up up. You 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>And <span style="color:red" data-ts="2948.965" data-end_ts="2949.005" title="2948.965" id=c_"2948.965">__I__</span> didn't ask you a single question, darling. So that's, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's the whole plan I want. I'm trying to stay, I'm trying to stay invisible, but I am, I'm always curious to, to ask what you think the future looks like. You actually, in my mind, you have been part of developing the future. You know, your work with convolution and all that stuff really changed the way people viewed reverb and, reverb creation and also how people viewed being able to work inside the box with a computer. I'm wondering, what do you see as sort of the future of the recording and production arts? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>To be honest, I think that, from my perspective as a plugin developer, actually the whole audio game hasn't changed that much in the past 10 years. Computers have gotten a little bit faster and, I guess, native instruments these days, take a lot more chunk out of than out of, the pockets of the musicians than they did, 15 years ago. But apart from that, if you look at the sequences that we run in as a plugin, and you know, that actually, well, you're one of the few people that made, made it, made their way out of it. Again, you first had to make plug and now you're in <span style="color:red" data-ts="3030.885" data-end_ts="3031.085" title="3030.885" id=c_"3030.885">__max__</span> for life. Right. So you, you've kind of broken the barriers a little bit. You made your space a little wider there, which are <span style="color:red" data-ts="3040.195" data-end_ts="3040.485" title="3040.195" id=c_"3040.195">__envi__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3040.485" data-end_ts="3040.605" title="3040.485" id=c_"3040.485">__is__</span> about, but if you, other than that, if you look at what these production tools are like, they're still based on the same paradigm as 20 years ago. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>It's, it hasn't changed that much. And, I'm doing convolution based stuff so far that in the past decade, a decade and a half actually, and I am recording spaces that have been around for sometimes hundreds <span style="color:red" data-ts="3065.445" data-end_ts="3065.605" title="3065.445" id=c_"3065.445">__or__</span> sometimes thousands of years, and they haven't changed. And I recorded them in a way, in a format that is, that has been current from when I started studying, like in 1987 to now, nothing has changed. There's like, it, it went from 16 to 24 bit, maybe. That's it. So I'm actually thinking I can, I can write this a little longer and I don't see it changing very much. I have seen some musical styles come back and, go away again, <laugh>, I think there are, I don't think there are massive changes coming. And I've been hearing about the collapse of the music industry for the past, what, seven, eight years. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>Right, right. And of course, major things have changed there, but I'm not sure if you see this Darwin type customer that we talked to is still the same type customer that we talked to 10 years ago. They're creative people trying to make something pretty. Most of them get paid for it. So from my perspective, not very much is changing. And I really like it because I have a job to do. I've been to many places, but there's like a million more than I need to go to. So let's not change it too much because, well, you know, I'd, I'd like to finish the job. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I hear <span style="color:red" data-ts="3142.885" data-end_ts="3143.045" title="3142.885" id=c_"3142.885">__you__</span>. Well, Arian, that's, that's inspiring and, and also pointed. I, I agree. Not a lot has changed, but it is awesome that we continue to work, with and for creative people doing creative things. Well, Arian, I want to thank you so much for taking the time to talk with me. I, I feel like you've done so much for helping the industry move forward, and I really appreciate you being willing to talk about how you do the things you do and, and what's going on behind the curtain. It's really fabulous. Is there any <span style="color:red" data-ts="3177.745" data-end_ts="3177.965" title="3177.745" id=c_"3177.745">__la__</span> last advice for people that you would have for people who are interested in pursuing technology and, music technology and that kind of stuff? What would you suggest to people that want to get into it now? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>You mean, want to become a producer of tools? Like Yes. Like I am. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Exactly. If, if there's, you know, I have a, I have a son who soon will be graduating from school and he'd like to get into this stuff. What, what is the advice that you'd give to you would give to someone like that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>I think he should just cram out algorithms and little tools, whether people need them or not. They shouldn't necessarily be special. Maybe just, have a bit of character, or as long as he made them and finished them in a way that he can release them. So you, so I think the key is you, you pick an idea, basically any idea, and then you finish it and in the process of finishing it, you will find a few little quirks that you can put into it, be it graphical or just in the GUI or in the sound, hopefully. And then when you have a finished product, you're gonna release it maybe for free, maybe for a little bit of money. And then you people will pick it up and they will give you feedback on it. And you will, you will be a happy guy, <laugh>. And, that's, that's my advice. And then you're gonna, then you're hopefully gonna fail making, scoring a hit, maybe five or 10 or 15 times. And then the 16th time when you least expect it, maybe you <span style="color:red" data-ts="3277.805" data-end_ts="3277.925" title="3277.805" id=c_"3277.805">__will__</span>, you'll score ahead. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. That's actually, that's, yeah, the idea of do the work, get out there and do work and let people interact with your work. That's really, that's really great 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>Advice. And don't let it, don't, don't sit around waiting for the next incredible idea, <laugh>, because really mediocre IDs are enough. I mean, I don't wanna put any company down, but look around you who made it right in, in our line of work. Right. Not, not very many of <span style="color:red" data-ts="3308.825" data-end_ts="3309.045" title="3308.825" id=c_"3308.825">__tho__</span> those IDs were spectacular to begin with. Right. And but they finished it and people are happy with it and it sounds rather nice. And so will the stuff that your son makes if he just does it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Indeed. Well, thank you so much again, I really appreciate your time. It's great catching up with you and great hearing about how about your work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>Sure. Okay, Darwin next time we speak, we speak about your work because I have a ton of questions for you too, <laugh>. Alright. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Thanks a lot. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Arjen: </b>It's been a joy Darwin Bye-Bye bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And there you have it. Another great podcast. When I listened to Aria's story about what he does for a living, I am very envious. It seems pretty awesome to hop in a car and go shoot an impulse response of a <span style="color:red" data-ts="3360.645" data-end_ts="3360.845" title="3360.645" id=c_"3360.645">__forest__</span>. That sounds like a lot of fun. But anyway, I want to thank you very much for listening. Thanks for sharing with your friends, great listenership again in recent weeks and I look forward to doing this for a long, long time. So thank you very much. Have a great one and I'll catch you next week.
