<b>Darwin: </b>Hello, today, I have the great fortune of getting a chance to talk to somebody whose name I've been reading for a long time, but who I've never actually talked to in person. So this is a real, pleasure for me. His name's Marcel <span style="color:red" data-ts="27.945" data-end_ts="28.165" title="27.945" id=c_"27.945">__Wix__</span>, and he is a media artist that I'll let, I'll let him define himself to you. But I find some of his work very compelling. Gregory introduced me to him. Gregory Taylor introduced me, and I am very excited to have a chance to talk to Marcel. So let's do it. Hey, Marcel, how's it going? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel Wierckx: </b>Hey, great, great to talk to you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thank you so much for taking the time outta your schedule to have a chat with me. I really appreciate it, man. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>Oh, that's no problem at all. Glad to do it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, why don't we start off and, start off by having you describe yourself because, when I look through your biomaterial as well as things that you've posted about your work, I could call you <span style="color:red" data-ts="72.815" data-end_ts="73.035" title="72.815" id=c_"72.815">__and__</span> one of any 12 things, and I would be sort of Right. So why don't I have you describe yourself to me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>Yeah, this is a, this is always a really difficult question for me to answer. I get this all the time. I, I like to see myself primarily as an audio visual composer, so as a composer that, that works equally on the visual and the sound domain. Although I've done a lot of, you know, traditional music composition for contemporary dance. And I also, you know, develop interactive systems for other artists. So I tend to write a lot of software. Interesting. Max patches, basically. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. So Max is your primary tool of destruction at this point? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>At this point, I mean, I would've said a few years ago it was 80% of my work. Now it's, it's nudged up to 90, 95% of what I do, I do in, in Max. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Wow, that's pretty cool. Is it mostly just because Max has improved or because you've improved your use of Max? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>Well, you know, a lot of the video work I used to do up until about, I guess 2010 was, was done in, after Effects. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>And I've tended to abandon the, this idea of the, how shall I say it? You know, like the film model of working with video, right. Working in a timeline, working with like the camera image, the filmed image as the basis for the video stuff I do. And I've gotten a bit more into, you know, programming <span style="color:red" data-ts="165.915" data-end_ts="166.075" title="165.915" id=c_"165.915">__an__</span> open GL and gotten a little bit better at, working with shaders and, working with textures. I mean, I objected for a long time to open GL because it's all looked so video game ish. Right. But I've discovered in the past couple of years that it doesn't have to look that way. <laugh>, and I've, I've tried to kind of make my own, kind of individual look with video in the, the, you know, the new JIT gl and the the JIT slab and stuff like that. Well, which isn't really that new anymore, but it's still kind of new for me. I'm still discovering new stuff every day with OpenGL. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So what, what are you doing? Because I, I, too, working with OpenGL has always been, something that, I've avoided simply because at least when I do something, it does in fact look like a bad, a really bad doom or something. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b><laugh>. Exactly. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What is it that you're doing that, that you feel like takes you past that or allows you at least in, in a feeling of your own work to feel like you're getting past that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>It always leery of giving away my, the recipe to my secret sauce. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Your secrets 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b><laugh>. But, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="237.595" data-end_ts="237.885" title="237.595" id=c_"237.595">__Well__</span>, you know what? Nobody listens to this podcast, so you're probably safe 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b><laugh>. Okay. So then Well, I, I, I have a feeling Greg will be listening, so 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>He's safe 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b><laugh>. Right. So feedback, really, and feedback of course. You know, feeding a texture back into <span style="color:red" data-ts="253.325" data-end_ts="253.445" title="253.325" id=c_"253.325">__a__</span>, into a slab is, is an easy enough thing to do. Right. It's the stuff that gets done in between the feedback, which is where you can get your really interesting, stuff happening. Sure, sure. Right. And, and different kinds of noise. I mean, <span style="color:red" data-ts="267.325" data-end_ts="267.445" title="267.325" id=c_"267.325">__I__</span> really <span style="color:red" data-ts="267.885" data-end_ts="268.085" title="267.885" id=c_"267.885">__ola__</span> a big, debt of gratitude to people like AKAs that, that develop these ideas of how to deal with randomness in interesting ways. So, and I try to implement that a lot in, like just little tiny grains of interesting randomness when you're, they're amplified in a feedback loop, can, can, you know, do so much more than just the typical kind of fractal images. Sure, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That's, that's an interesting point. And I think one of the things that, I certainly noticed is, you know, for a while when there was, you know, there was a long period of time where random was kind of, randomness, was kind of treated like it was, unique and always special. And then there was a time where people started trying to avoid randomness because it was like, well, you know, we <span style="color:red" data-ts="319.125" data-end_ts="319.285" title="319.125" id=c_"319.125">__need__</span>, we need to show direction and we need to show, purpose and all that stuff. And I think what it's led to is a very thoughtful approach to randomness where people like enokis and and others have sort of like sketched out ways to approach randomness that isn't just, you know, throw a generic number on a thing and, and let it go crazy, but rather using it as an influence rather than the totality of the, of the output. Right. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>Exactly. I I just recently saw an interview with AKAs that I hadn't seen before where he was describing, his method of con of composition, like shooting a machine gun <laugh>. You don't know exactly where the bullets are gonna go, but you have a pretty good idea and, and you're the one directing the gun. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>I, I thought that was a really interesting metaphor. And I, I think that it's not really exactly the way I work, but it's, it's, it's definitely a, a way of looking at it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, and like randomness machine guns have a tendency to hurt, hurt nearby people as well. <laugh>. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b><laugh>, exactly. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So why don't you tell us a little bit about some of your most recent work? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>Well, I just finished a piece. We got our last performance coming up soon with, a new young choreographer, SPER Lark. And, there we're, filling the theater up with smoke and using Beamers, in North American terms projectors, to, you know, draw planes in the smoke. Now, this is a really old trick, but the thing that I've done is I've attached every little bit of light that the projectors are throwing into the space to a sound Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And this is all going on together with a dancer. So I've really tried to, really it's about composing a system. So, I'm performing the piece live, but I'm shooting pixels out into the space, which is filled with smoke. And, the dancer's interacting with that, and I'm performing together with the dancer. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Wow. That's, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>But it's, it's mostly this, this unification of, the sound and the light, that I think is working really well with that piece. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's really, that really sounds like a lot of fun. Sounds pretty awesome. How did you get, is this your first time working with dancers or have you been working with choreographers for a while? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>I've been working with dance since, I guess about 1999, 2000. Oh, something like that. Sinces back to my student, student days. Yeah. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. And, is, do you generally do, well, it sounds like in this case you're doing both visuals and, and audio. Do you have a tendency to do one or the other? Do you always kind of combine them both into one unified work? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>That's what I would like to do. But of course, with, with choreographers, generally I'm not in charge of the project. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know, I'm part of a team, right. And so I always try to, you know, give my inputs of, you know, what I would like to see or what I would like to do. But generally it's the choreographer or the producer <span style="color:red" data-ts="512.105" data-end_ts="512.325" title="512.105" id=c_"512.105">__or__</span> the company or something like that that comes up with <span style="color:red" data-ts="514.645" data-end_ts="514.805" title="514.645" id=c_"514.645">__the__</span> concept. So people tend to ask me for things that they know I'm good at, but the piece is not always, doesn't always call for video or doesn't always call for technology. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. Now do you do work outside of working with dancers? Do you do just straight composition for installation or for like, like album release or like audio work? Or do you do that kind of stuff, or do you No. Or is this mainly your focus? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>My, my only, CD release was way back in 1994, and that was with a grunge band. So, no, I haven't done, any, I haven't worked in that model of, production for, for a hugely long time. No, it's, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Is it, is it because you don't think it's valid? Or is that just not where your voice takes you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>I've always resisted being a tape composer, tape music composer. I've always thought of myself as, somebody who designs pieces with technology that need to <span style="color:red" data-ts="584.925" data-end_ts="585.085" title="584.925" id=c_"584.925">__be__</span> performed live. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So this, this is something I've been really trying to focus on the last little while. But yeah. Yeah, a difficult question. Mostly I composed for something, I, I really can't remember the last time I, composed a piece just out of kind of, blind inspiration or something like that. So, you know, a couple of my solo pieces were composed for the 40 sound system. I'm not sure if you're familiar with that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm not, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>It's a, a sound projection system with something like, 92 speakers spread out across the space. Okay. I would encourage all your listeners to check out <span style="color:red" data-ts="629.155" data-end_ts="629.445" title="629.155" id=c_"629.155">__four__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="629.565" data-end_ts="629.685" title="629.565" id=c_"629.565">__D__</span> sound.net. It's a really spectacular system. But, I did a project with them last year and, working on a new project with them again this year. Or, you know, the pieces that I composed for dance, of course, they're, you know, commissions really, writing something for a specific concept for a specific venue and stuff like that. So that really doesn't lend itself to, you know, any kind of digital or, or Right. Any kind of release, really. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So I wanna come back to that because you, you said something there that really resonates with me. But before we go there, one of the things that I like doing is talking to people about, sort of their beginning story, how they came to be the artist or builder or maker or whatever that they are. And in your case, especially having this, you know, this kind of focus on performance, but combination of visual and audio, and especially interacting with dancers and, and the live movement of that, it's a curious set of interests and capabilities, especially when you tie code into it. Right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I'm curious, what's, what's your background? How did you get to be where you are now? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>Let's see. When I was about, I guess, eight years old, I've got a brother who's about 10 years older than me. And, we, we didn't have that much money. We, weren't a really rich family, but my oldest brother was into computers, so he managed to get his hands on the parts to build an Apple <span style="color:red" data-ts="736.145" data-end_ts="736.365" title="736.145" id=c_"736.145">__two__</span> computer. We couldn't buy the ROMs, so he managed to, to berm the Apple ROMs from somebody else. <span style="color:red" data-ts="743.145" data-end_ts="743.365" title="743.145" id=c_"743.145">__But__</span> I used to just kind of watch over his shoulder while he was soldering stuff together. I was really fascinated by that. And, you know, when we finally got the thing up and running, you know, he would turn it on and it would <span style="color:red" data-ts="753.085" data-end_ts="753.205" title="753.085" id=c_"753.085">__be__</span> basically do nothing. Right. Right. And I would watch him code things and assembly and, you know, he was more interested in, in engineering and mathematics and stuff like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>So the, the stuff coming out wasn't all that interesting. But one day, I guess, I dunno, it was about 11 or 12, and I realized how graphics work on that machine that you just write, you know, hex numbers into memory, and that's how you drop pixels on the screen. I started getting books and magazines about how to make video games. And, you know, back then if you wanted to play, or if I wanted to play a video game on the Apple <span style="color:red" data-ts="786.365" data-end_ts="786.565" title="786.365" id=c_"786.365">__two__</span>, I had to go buy a magazine with a video game and assembly language and type and type it over. Right. You type in the game and then it wouldn't work, of course. Right. So you'd have to go through it to find out what you typed in wrong. And that was just an immense learning experience for me. But, you know, by the time I hit 14 or 15, I completely abandoned computers and went into music and started playing guitar. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>And of course, you know, started playing rock, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And did that up until my twenties, kind of, you know, computers were kind of in the background, but actually have to admit between 15 and 20 years old, I, I don't think I actually even touched a computer because it was all just guitar, guitar, guitar. Sure. But then, you know, I, so I played rock for a while, and at a certain point I, I thought, okay, I think I better get into serious music 'cause I don't think I can handle the rock lifestyle for the rest of my life. <laugh>. And, so I went to university and studied composition. 'cause I, I wanted to write string quartets. And, a required course in the composition department was computer music, not computer music, electronic music. So, you know, we learned about tape splicing. We learned about, you know, generally all that kinds of stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>And then we got to the unit of the course where we talked about software. My teacher showed me Max, which at that time was, you know, max version 2.5, I think. And he showed me how you could just send midi, you know, system exclusive data and stuff like that to DX sevens or TX eighteens, and really get the most outrageous sounds out of them. That really resonated with me. And then the first couple of assignments that I got in that class, the teacher said, where the, where the heck did you learn all this stuff? <laugh>? And it just kind of came intuitively to me because I understood how, you know, how hex numbers work and, and how data works on a computer and how, you know, how if you wanna make a sound, you know, you gotta think of timing, you gotta think of, the speed of messages coming out and stuff like that. I mean, I'm kind of oversimplifying it, but, I don't know. And that was kind of the moment that I thought, Hey, wait a minute, I'm actually kind of good at this computer stuff. And I <span style="color:red" data-ts="917.915" data-end_ts="918.205" title="917.915" id=c_"917.915">__kind__</span> of really thanked my brother for that Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> at that time. So that's, that's kind kind of how I got into, computer, writing max, max patches for music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And what were your, some of your first opportunities to make the transition from being a grunge band guitarist to being a composer? I mean, how did you, what did that transition look like? Did, were you like doing a bunch of stuff as part of your schooling and then, you know, you met people there that opened doors, or was it, yeah. Was it something else? Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>It was, it was really my, composition teacher at the uni at, university of Manitoba in Winnipeg. Michael Matthews, you know, he, he was a, a huge fan of, of writing max patches and writing music that way. But he always said he never had the time to pursue that in depth, because he was busy writing string or orchestra pieces and stuff like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>But he was a big inspiration because he, he was the first one that that kind of told me, you know, these little two and three minute pieces that I was writing in Max, at the time that he said, you know, is actually really unique and special what you're doing, and I think you should pursue this more. So yeah, that was, <span style="color:red" data-ts="999.785" data-end_ts="1000.005" title="999.785" id=c_"999.785">__and__</span>, and, you know, of course I didn't stop completely playing rock to pay my way through university. I actually, you know, I kept playing with the rock band and I actually played in a, a seventies disco band for a while. Wow. Which really helped, you know, it, it paid the bills, but it wasn't musically satisfying. But, yeah, it was really a, kind of a, I don't <span style="color:red" data-ts="1021.245" data-end_ts="1021.325" title="1021.245" id=c_"1021.245">__know__</span>, I guess everyone kind of goes through this in their, in their twenties, they make a switch and they realize, Hey, I don't think I can keep doing what I'm doing now for the rest of my life. Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1029.485" data-end_ts="1029.645" title="1029.485" id=c_"1029.485">__And__</span> it was kind of like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Interesting, interesting. And how did you first get introduced to dance? To dance? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>That was when I moved to the Netherlands in 1999. And I was, I, I had started on a PhD in, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1048.315" data-end_ts="1048.605" title="1048.315" id=c_"1048.315">__URAC__</span> School of Music and Technology, and I never ended up finishing that PhD, but, that's where I was introduced to some dancers from the dance group, Christina De <span style="color:red" data-ts="1058.085" data-end_ts="1058.405" title="1058.085" id=c_"1058.085">__Chatel__</span>, which is a big dance group here in Holland, or was a big dance group here in Holland. It's not around anymore. And, yeah, I had, do you remember the, the bomb object in Max? Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>Yeah. I, I did a piece with that, that together with, VNS, David Rocha's system. <laugh>, yes. And, we did a, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1080.005" data-end_ts="1080.125" title="1080.005" id=c_"1080.005">__a__</span>, a dance piece where I had a, a couple of, I guess <span style="color:red" data-ts="1083.045" data-end_ts="1083.245" title="1083.045" id=c_"1083.045">__it__</span> was the first generation G three max, and I had one for, one for run, one running the bomb patch and one running VNS and, with two dancers. And we made a piece, back then, which, yeah, it really got me excited about working with dance. I was really lucky to have met a couple of people that, that I think kind of got what I was doing, and were really willing to go along with me on that. And that, that was a really rewarding experience. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Yay. Alright. Now I wanna talk about this concept of composing for something, because I have to tell you, I personally seem to have a real problem doing recorded music. Hmm. And I don't have a I and I don't have a problem if I am doing either something for a project or if I'm preparing for a performance. And I think it's, I think what you hit on was the reason, if I'm doing a piece for something, it gives me an explicit direction. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>Exactly. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And then I have the focus to, to complete a project. And that doesn't seem to come naturally for me if I just, if my purpose this is, is to say, oh, I'm gonna make some music for release, saying that somehow feels like, well, I'm gonna artificially create something that doesn't necessarily have meaning. Right. <laugh>. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And maybe I'm putting like too big of a envelope around it, but there seems to be something about a accomplishing work that has meaning that like being, being, being a self-directed artist doesn't, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>Yeah. You know, there's this, this, term here that in <span style="color:red" data-ts="1190.125" data-end_ts="1190.405" title="1190.125" id=c_"1190.125">__Holland__</span> that gets bandied about, about the, this older camera cist of the slap camera communist, which is like the, the bedroom composer or somebody that just, you know, puts in tons of hours in, in their attic or in their little home studio making music that nobody ever listens to. I've always dreaded the idea of, of nobody listening to my music. <laugh>. I've done pieces of course for, you know, instrument and tape or instrument and a live electronics and stuff like that. And, it's really, really depressing to me to work, to work really hard, really long and, and pour all your, your blood, sweat and tears in a piece that gets played five times for 20 people each time, you know? Right. That was, I think that was a big motivator for me as well for getting into dance, because, that was my opportunity to have pieces played a bit more often to play for an audience that is, you know, not necessarily all other musicians or other composers. Right. And especially a younger audience as well. Right. The dance, that dance audience is generally made up of a much wider demographic, young and old, than music concerts. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I actually had a really interesting conversation this last weekend. I was at the Berkeley College of Music for their Voltage Connect thing. Right. And, I was on a panel of people talking about performing with modular synthesizers, which is one of the things I do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And one of the questions from the audience was like, how do we, you know, how do we generate gigs? How do we get out there and do this stuff? And, you know, some of the suggestions were, well, you know, build up a local scene or whatever. But my suggestion was to change your imagination of what a performance is. And I talked about working with dancers and how the audience seemed so appreciative of aggressively different music because they weren't there to just be critical of the music. In fact, they were there if they were gonna be critical about anything, they were actually there to be critical about dancers. Yeah. And so whatever music showed up, if it was different, that was just kind of like extra sauce on the sundae. Right. Yeah. Yeah. And, I, I too have found dance audiences incredibly receptive, but also dancers incredibly receptive to sometimes fairly aggressive experimentalism. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>Yeah, exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Because it pushes them as much as it's pushing you and, and that seems to be something that they really embrace. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>Yeah. Yeah. Especially if you make music that doesn't, oblige the dancers to do anything specific. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>I, I generally don't work with Pulse in my music. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I mean, there's, there's definitely rhythm, there's definitely beat, but I, I tend to not make music that that forces the dancers into any kind of specific, movement vocabulary or something. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, that's interesting. I had someone come up from the audience actually and mention that he too, his girlfriend was a dancer and he too had started working with dance and found it an incredibly freeing experience. You know, also the in in there tends to be more people in the audience then, you know, if you do a coffee shop, electronic music experimentalism gig. Right. Yeah. There you, they're, you're assured of having three people, at least one of whom is a homeless person looking to get warm <laugh>. Right, right. So <laugh>. But, that's really interesting. Now, when you work with these, with these groups, what does your performance rig look like? Are you like a one laptop guy? Are you a bunch of laptop guys, or do you bring like the truck full of gear? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>This changes show by show, but generally, no, I'm not a truckload full of gear kind of, kind of performer. For the audio video stuff I do, I've got a, a Mac Pro, one of those, you know, the giant Ashtrays, which 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The round ones, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>Yeah. Oh really? 'cause 'cause that thing can handle a few video outputs. It's nice and portable and, you know, that with an audio interface is pretty much my setup and a couple of Beamers. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>Back in the day, of course, when I first started with dance and with technology, it was really hip to have video cameras all over the place and, 20 Beamers and stuff like that. Although this last piece that I've done with, SPER Lark, I think we got six Beamers on the stage, which it's a bit more than I would normally do, but, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That's, that's a punch now. Yeah. So that's not a strictly, it's portable ish, but it's not necessarily portable and it kind of takes up a fair amount of room too. Right. Now do you, do you tend to tend to work like out of a booth with long wire runs? Or are you like on side stage, or do you sit in the middle of the stage? Where, where do, how do you interact? Where do you set yourself up in the venue? Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>That, that changes show by show For this last piece, I'm on stage. Okay. On the side of the stage. Normally I wouldn't want to be doing that unless I was doing something that's also interesting for the audience to see. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So I've done a piece with a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1517.645" data-end_ts="1517.845" title="1517.645" id=c_"1517.645">__Van__</span> Dyke where I was playing guitars and doing electronics. So at least then the audience, you know, has, has got something, something to watch to look at. I'm actually, you know, I'm not just twiddling a controller. Right, right. But I mean about the portability of my gear, I've got a set up now that I can do just about any of the pieces that I've done recently, and can take it all on carry-on baggage, so, really, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Wow. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>It's, it's been quite a mission of mine to, to get stuff, carry-on size to perform with. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, but if you're using a Mac Pro, what are you, what do you use for a monitor with that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>Usually I would just ask the venue to provide. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, I see. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'd have a tech rider where I, just stuff that's not specific to me that the venue can provide easily. I mean, everybody's got an old VH VGA monitor line 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Laying around. Right. Good point. It's a good point. Mean, well, it's, it's one of those things that's, that it's not easy even to consider is, I think it's a media artist thing particularly. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, we're so used to everything we do being so ridiculously weird that the assumption is nobody else is gonna have anything that can help. So that we have to literally call everything around. And I have to admit that so often, you know, I haul around 20 pounds of extension cords, even if, even though I know that at most of these venues they have more extension cords than God. Right. Yeah, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Exactly. But I still get like, obsessed with, like, I need to make sure that I have everything, you know, at hand and under my control. I think, I think maybe that's, maybe that's kind of the way our artwork is that we have a tendency to also be maybe a little bit of, control freak, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>OCD <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Something like that. Right. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>Yeah. No, I mean, I'm, I'm, it really depends on the gig. I mean, generally the dance pieces that I do, they're, they're made, together with a production house or production company where we Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, we sit down and we talk about gear, and we talk about what, you know, what we're gonna expect from the venue, what we're gonna buy ourselves. I mean, these last few pieces that I did with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1646.505" data-end_ts="1646.725" title="1646.505" id=c_"1646.505">__Auk__</span> Van Dyke, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1648.745" data-end_ts="1648.965" title="1648.745" id=c_"1648.745">__the__</span>, it's really truckloads of gear, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So if I have my stuff in my Carry-on the stuff that's really specific to me, and if I can specify in adequate detail what the venue or what the production house has gotta provide, I've never really had problems with that. It's really about being specific enough. Right. It's the, it's the brown m and m story. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Right. Let's talk a little bit about the development of the work. My experience working with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1676.525" data-end_ts="1676.685" title="1676.525" id=c_"1676.525">__the__</span> dancers, I, I primarily worked with just one dance group, and so we ended up with a very good collaboration because we did, you know, probably eight or 10 pieces together, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And so initially it started off with them kind of coming to me with a preset thing, but relatively quickly it got to be a very collaborative development process. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you're working with a lot of different people. Yeah. What is, what is the performance development look like? Do you, do they work on movements and then you try and come up with sounds and visuals? Or do you come with sonic and visual ideas that they build off of? Or how, how does, how is that working in your experience? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>Yeah, the, the best working method for me with dance is me being in the studio, you know, at least talking through concept and roughing out a couple of ideas with a choreographer, in just at home or, or in my work, workspace. Just to get an idea, make sure that we're both kind of on the same page, but the, the real work gets done together in the studio. So I'll have prepared a couple of instruments, as it were, software instruments, that I've programmed or sometimes little fragments of composition. I mean, it kind of depends on, on how the piece is going to run, if the piece is gonna run without me or if I'm gonna really be performing the piece. But yeah, it's, it's really what I've discovered is this recursion between, the choreographer and the music where I can in rehearsal, if they're running a scene, sometimes I'll throw in a music that they haven't heard before, <laugh> just to see what happens. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>Right. And this is, it's kind of luxurious, to work with people like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1785.665" data-end_ts="1785.885" title="1785.665" id=c_"1785.665">__auk__</span> Van Dyke, because she tolerates that some choreographers, I think wouldn't <laugh>. Right. But, she actually valued that because she said quite often the music would let her see her choreography differently. So it's, it's really important. I spend a lot of time in the studio with the dancers, even talking about if there's something going on in the movement that I think is, should be different because of what my musical idea is. I'm not afraid to say that. And, that's resulted in some pretty interesting scenes. Interesting. Not that I'm, not, that I'm trying to take credit for choreography 'cause Right. You don't want me choreographing 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Right. But now, one of my experiences that was, that actually just really has stuck with me throughout was one of the first times I was working with this dance company, I did a thing that did some video delay work, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And it was, it was really beautiful with the movement they were doing. So I did it, I showed it to 'em, they really enjoyed it. They kind of graphed out a piece of it, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1848.245" data-end_ts="1848.445" title="1848.245" id=c_"1848.245">__that__</span>, that kind of became part of the performance. The next time I came, they had done further work on their movement, and they had actually integrated some things that sort of were like their physical manifestation of what a visual feedback thing looks like. They basically took that as a concept and then sort of like emulated it in real life, which was kind of spooky. That was the point at, at which I felt like, well, this is, this is something that's even more than a collaboration in a way. Exactly. It's, it's like almost a different kind of feedback circuit. Do you experience that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>Yeah, absolutely. And this is the best type of working situation, right? The virtuous spiral where, you know, good ideas beget more good ideas. And, that, that's really exciting to be in that kind of situation. And the best choreographers I've worked with were not necessarily the ones that were tally making the best choreographies, but were the ones that were opening up their rehearsal space to the, to the specific abilities and talents of the people they had in the space. Sure. Everybody could contribute and, you got pieces that were just so much more than, than a sum of the people working on it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, absolutely. That's, yeah, that's a great point. Now, from your experience, how much of what you do is like really intellectualized and how often do you stumble into happy accidents? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b><laugh>? That's a really good question. I don't know. I guess it's about 70% happy accidents, <laugh> and 70% knowing what I'm doing. Quite, quite literally. I mean, I had a, I think I did this piece, called an act of Now together with Auk <span style="color:red" data-ts="1958.365" data-end_ts="1958.565" title="1958.365" id=c_"1958.365">__Van__</span> Dyke in Australia with a chunky move Mm-Hmm. And in my opinion, the best moment, kind of the, the climax in the movement, in the music in that piece is a, the dancers, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1972.145" data-end_ts="1972.365" title="1972.145" id=c_"1972.145">__it__</span> kinda hard to explain. The dancers are in a glass house and, for this performance, and when we were rehearsing, they were in this glass house, and they were kind of singing, just kind of improvising. I had, I had a mic, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1984.445" data-end_ts="1984.565" title="1984.445" id=c_"1984.445">__a__</span>, a really good mic in the glass house at that moment, and I just kind of grabbed a sample of that, and I used that as a source, and I did some granular and I did some, some processing on it, and it came out, and it's just the coolest piece of music. I could never have thought of that beforehand, that music, it was just because the dancers were kind of messing around singing and having fun. That, that turned into a, a really great bit of source material. And generally that's how I work. I, I find things, I stumble across things and, you know, kind of massage them into musically interesting, pieces. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's, that sounds, that sounds fun. It sounds like you've really gotten a chance to do some work with some interesting people and some really open-minded people too. That's gotta be a real joy to find those people and then to just find a way to <laugh> not not let them go away. Right, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I, I think definitely the thing that I've learned is that with choreographers is that sometimes they say they know exactly what they want. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But if you confront them with different possibilities, they start to realize, oh, wait a minute. There's other things that I, i, I don't know, are possible. And, you know, that that's always been, I've seen that as my role as the composer in pieces always, with dance, is to open up possibilities to different things, allowing different kinds of things to happen than what somebody might already know they can do, that they can stumble across things that they didn't know could happen. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Now, you talk about yourself as being a composer, but that's not typically something that someone who does visuals would call themselves. Right? Yeah. Composer, we <span style="color:red" data-ts="2088.325" data-end_ts="2088.445" title="2088.325" id=c_"2088.325">__tend__</span>, we tend to think of the word composer as being very strictly tied, not even to sound, but specifically to music, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This, this has been a, a recurring theme in my, in my life in the past, at least 15 years or something. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Is it something that you have to, like, explain away to people, or is it something you're trying to introduce them to? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>Well, I mean, you know, back a long time ago when, when jitter was kind of starting to be useful, I was teaching, at an institute here and, I said to kind of my superior, you know, this jitter thing, we should, we should buy a whole bunch of licenses and get into this and there, you know, some other video software. And I said, because, you know, the stuff I'm doing with the students with music, they can basically kind of copy paste their ideas to the video domain and we can do some really cool stuff. And I remember my superior at that time telling me, well, you know what? We are a music school and if the students wanna work with video, then they should go over to the next building, find a video guy right. To, to collaborate with. And it frustrated me at that moment. And, so I kind of used some gorilla tactics and just started teaching jitter in the classes. Anyway, you know, some really interesting students came outta that, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2165.485" data-end_ts="2165.765" title="2165.485" id=c_"2165.485">__Tara__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2165.855" data-end_ts="2166.205" title="2165.855" id=c_"2165.855">__Kaari__</span> is one that came out of that, at that period of, my teaching career. Yeah. Peter Williams, a couple of really great students, Paul Holleman. Lots of great guys came outta that period, you know, luckily I still teach there, and they're not nearly, as close-minded, but it took a little bit of convincing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, one of the things I often like asking people is what their future looks like, but it's kind of, I I am, I'm kind of curious where you'd go with it, because, you know, if I'm talking to someone who is building gear, their future is like, where is technology gonna take me? And the development of gear? Right. Or if I'm talking to somebody who is, you know, who performs using a certain set of equipment, again, the equipment is sort of like the driving force of the, of what their future looks like. Right. But in your case, you seem to kind of float above other than your sort of dedication to max and jitter, you seem to sort of like float above the influence of gear, and mostly are focused on this collaborative and real time, interaction with people and with sound and with visuals. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah. So how I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2242.645" data-end_ts="2242.725" title="2242.645" id=c_"2242.645">__am__</span>, I don't even know how to structure a question about what does your future look like other than to just say where, what directions do you see yourself being drawn? I mean, yeah, it sounds like this OpenGL thing has been a generation of some ideas, but I'm just wondering is there are things, what are the things that drive you into future change? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>Yeah. This, I mean, this is a really easy question for me to answer because I'm, I'm intensely <span style="color:red" data-ts="2270.005" data-end_ts="2270.245" title="2270.005" id=c_"2270.005">__basic__</span> busy with exactly this question right now. A couple of things. First is thinking about, media and content in a completely different way. So the content of my pieces, whereas, you know, the typical audio visual piece you would think of, you know, the video track and the audio track and this kind of linear thing in terms of, you know, your frames or something like that. I'm starting to think of work in terms of process, and content as being the code, right? Or the max patch, in my case, oftentimes Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But really composing in that medium instead of composing the music or the image, right? So thinking about data flow, data structure, stuff like that. And that being really the, the domain in which I'm composing, that is one thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>The other thing is the whole notion of participation in a technological society. What does participation mean for an audience? And, I've been doing some spectacular work with a jazz band here in Holland right now called Tin Men in the Telephone. And they've got an app that the audience, you know, installs on their phone when they come in Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And basically they compose music together with the audience during the show. So things like, you know, somebody in the audience can leave a voicemail for the band, and the band uses that voicemail as a source for composing a piece on the spot. That kind of thing really excites me. The other thing is I'm working on a project together with Paul Holleman right now from 40 Sound, where we're gonna be using, basically, web technologies so people in the audience can just visit a webpage and their phones, will be taken over and will become part of the performance. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>So these kinds of things I'm working on, and also getting away from the idea of screen and speakers as well. Right? So for these dance pieces I'm doing now, it's about, you know, projecting on the floor, projecting in the space, getting away from this whole notion of, you know, this four by three or 16 by nine screen that you're staring at in a performance. Sure. And also with music, not necessarily just spatialization, but thinking music in much different terms, thinking of music in terms of how it can be linked in real explicit terms to, to what you're seeing and what you're experience, experiencing. So, and this is, you know, quite similar to the things that <span style="color:red" data-ts="2423.955" data-end_ts="2424.245" title="2423.955" id=c_"2423.955">__Tara__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2424.295" data-end_ts="2424.645" title="2424.295" id=c_"2424.295">__Barry__</span> has been working on also, you know, Robert <span style="color:red" data-ts="2427.315" data-end_ts="2427.605" title="2427.315" id=c_"2427.315">__Heay__</span>, also 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. With his laser pieces, certainly 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2430.355" data-end_ts="2430.845" title="2430.355" id=c_"2430.355">__Exactly__</span>. His laser, the screen, right. Yeah. Yeah. Although I, I tend to see my work as much less engineering than composing, whereas somebody like Robert <span style="color:red" data-ts="2440.715" data-end_ts="2441.005" title="2440.715" id=c_"2440.715">__Heay__</span> is, is very 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Engineering 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>Spectacular. Yeah. Spectacular in terms of engineering. But on a musical level, I would see the kinds of things that I do on a completely different plane than, than how he works 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now. Going back to the discussion about like composing with the medium instead of outside of the medium of code or whatever, or of working with participation, especially participation for devices and stuff. What one of the things that has, I hate to admit this because this is gonna sound like either like I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2477.845" data-end_ts="2477.885" title="2477.845" id=c_"2477.845">__am__</span> like an old guy shouting at kids on the lawn, or it's gonna sound like somebody who just doesn't get it. But oftentimes when I've seen work done that uses like phone technology or Twitter feeds or something like that, it seems trite to me. Yeah. And similarly when I see things that sort of embrace code as the artistic medium Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, it often seems, like it might be a very advanced use of code to make what seems to be trite artwork. Yeah. What can you do to avoid that? What can you do to sort of like, transcend, transcend the artifact of either the, the code or the iPhone as being the interesting thing in, in a participatory or a medium based artwork? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>Yeah, yeah. In, in my audio visual work, so things like black noise, white silence, and white light, black static, I was really thinking about impact on the viewer. So I was really, you know, the working on the code and stuff like that, you know, there's this kind of period in the project where I obsess about getting the code right. But in the end, when I actually make the piece, I'm primarily concerned with how can I grab somebody by the hair and, and make them feel something, right? Sure. It sounds a little bit aggressive, but, but, but that's really, I, I won't do anything unless it can have that, that sense to it. And with, you know, with this jazz band that I work with, with, with Tin Men <span style="color:red" data-ts="2580.595" data-end_ts="2580.755" title="2580.595" id=c_"2580.595">__and__</span> the telephone, the first thing for them always is the music's gotta be good. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>The playing's gotta be good. They gotta be pushing themselves musically really hard every night, and the electronics and the interaction and all that kind of stuff that is supposed to be there to influence that. But the primary thing is, is these are, you know, spectacularly good musicians, and that's what the audience has to go home. Remembering the electronics, the interaction, the, the stuff with the iPhones and stuff like that is there to help them realize that. So it's really about the people. It's really about the human experience. And I love working with code. I love, you know, messing around with shaders and stuff like that, but none of that matters when the performance is actually happening at that moment. You gotta be thinking of the people that are in the space that you're sharing an experience together with the people. And, I'm really adamant about that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, Marcel, that's, that was very well stated, and I think it's probably something that, should be like tattooed on, art students' forearms when they're going through school. Right? Right. I really appreciate that view on it because it seems to me to be, I think we have to embrace these things because they really are the future. But it's, it's so hard to do it when, you know, when you see things being used in a, in a pointless way. But I, I guess that that's always been sort of the trap of using technology and art, which is sort of like the first pass concept with any technology behind artwork is to glorify, glorify the technology and Right. And it takes a while to, maybe maybe your, background as a grunge guitarist actually does come to be a real, real valuable part of grabbing people by the hair. Right. <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>Maybe. Yeah. <laugh>. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, Marcel, I want to thank you so much for, for the time. I've used up my time already, and, I appreciate the chat. One last question for you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>For somebody, for a, a newbie listener that might be wondering, well, how do I get into working with dancers? Or how do I get into doing a thing like, you're doing, what, what is your suggestion? How do people get started? What, what would be the path that you would suggest that people take now? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>Make friends, get out of the house. Stop, stop working in your bedroom and go to performances and go to, you know, there's quite often when I do dance performances at the end of the performance, we would, you know, put a couple of chairs on the stage and chat with the audience or stuff like that. You know, make personal contacts with people, search people out whose work you like, and, get out there. 'cause it's really easy to get sucked into your, laptop as a person. And you gotta realize that these, these personal connections are really important and, and be critical. You know, find people that you really like and, and decide for yourself what you like about them, about their work, and kind of just go for it. It sounds, I don't know, maybe that sounds like a bit of an empty answer, but, I mean, that's kind of what worked for me, really. And I guess the other piece of advice is no matter what, make your most excellent work, which also sounds kind of like a, an empty thing to say, but it's really true. Never let yourself get lazy no matter what project you're working on, whether it's a hundred thousand Euro budget or a 10 Euro budget, always put a hundred percent of yourself into it.

<b>Darwin: </b>So, good. So smart. Well, thank you so much again, for your time and for, being so open to talk about, not only your work, but how you, how you perceive people can work. It's, that's really great. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, yeah. Thank you very much for this opportunity. It was really enjoyable. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Indeed. All right. Thanks a lot. And we will talk again soon. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marcel: </b>Thank you. Bye bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Many thanks to Marcel for that great overview of what he does and how he does it. And, some really nice introspection there about the whole process and, and how you work your way into doing significant work. Thanks to him on that. Thanks to you, the listeners for showing up again. I really appreciate it. Hang on 'cause we've got plenty more coming. We've got some really interesting people, booked for the next couple of weeks. So I'm looking forward to talking to these folks and to share the, their stories with you. With that, I just want to again, remind you to hashtag tripod T-R-Y-P-O-D, to let your friends, family and everyone else know a little bit about what you're listening to, share this podcast if you can. And, but otherwise, I will see you next week. Bye.
