<b>Darwin: </b>All right. Today I get a chance to talk to somebody that whose name I've been seeing for an awfully long time, but I have never actually spoken to. His name is, Ali Larkin, and he does a little bit of ev everything. And at least in my, in my perception of <span style="color:red" data-ts="29.755" data-end_ts="29.955" title="29.755" id=c_"29.755">__him__</span>, him, he does a little of everything. So what I wanna do is I want to talk to him a little bit about how he does, what he does, where he is coming from, all that stuff. But mostly I wanna start off by introducing him and having him tell us a little bit about what he does. So with that, I will say hello to Ali. Hey Ali, how's it going? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Oli Larkin: </b>Good, thanks. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm all right. Thank you so much for taking the time to be part of this podcast. I really appreciate it, man. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Oli: </b>Well, thanks for inviting me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So why don't we start off by having you, I mean, I, I almost hesitate to want to try and say the things you do because you have a lot of things that you juggle, and I'm not sure what is sort of like the thing that currently has your attention. So I will let you define it instead of trying to do so myself. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Oli: </b>So I would say I'm, I'm an audio programmer, basically. I get my kicks out of making audio software. I don't define myself as a musician. I just stopped really actually making music. And, yeah, round about the time I got into programming <laugh>. Somehow my brain just, lends itself more towards the programming. But all the programming I do is to do with music and audio. I don't know, I somehow, sometimes I feel like, the way I approach coding is kind of like a frenzied way. Some kind of artist might approach making an album or something, <laugh> rather than a <laugh> rather than a very strict disciplined kind of programming style. Like, like you probably want to have if you're, if you're actually doing it, as a day job in a company. Right. But, yeah, I sort of, I've worked in various universities and, it's been a hobby and I've been very lucky to, to have jobs which have kind of aligned with my hobby. Spent a long time teaching max and, audio programming. Right. So yeah, somehow I managed to keep my hobby and my, my day job quite aligned. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well that puts you in a position of being like the envy of an awful lot of us because to have that kind of alignment sort of makes any job a dream job if it's aligned in that way, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Oli: </b>Yeah. Sometimes I think it could be a mixed lesson. 'cause <laugh> you, you know, you have a good idea and, you're still thinking about it before you go to bed or whatever. I suppose you Yeah, same with <span style="color:red" data-ts="163.395" data-end_ts="163.555" title="163.395" id=c_"163.395">__with__</span> other jobs, but other jobs, you're not tempted to fire up the computer and, dark coding late at night. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>There is that sense because it's part of like the quote, like creative community that somehow that makes like work obsessions seem somehow Okay. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Oli: </b>Yeah. Well, it's something you have to keep check of. It's not, not really <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's not really Okay. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Oli: </b>Well, you know, sometimes you get really great ideas at two o'clock in the morning and stuff like that, so 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. You gotta, you gotta do what you gotta do. Right. So, I noticed from just sort of like doing a, a drive by on your website and, some of the stuff we exchanged email about, you have got your hands in a lot of different things. You've got this thing I plug, which is a framework for doing, doing plugin development. You're working with web audio stuff. You're working with the Faust language, you're Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you're somehow mixing juice programming in with that. And, Mm-Hmm, <affirmative>. And at the same time, you're also doing work in some binaural and immersive recording stuff. How do you, how do you choose which thing to work on? Are you <span style="color:red" data-ts="236.665" data-end_ts="236.785" title="236.665" id=c_"236.665">__b__</span> are you juggling them all at once or do you like work on one for a while and then jump to the other? And if you do that, what's your current obsession? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Oli: </b>I do juggle a lot and, sometimes things just magically seem to align, and I suddenly realized that all the different things I was juggling are actually the same thing. So I mean, at the moment I'm doing a PhD and I'm developing software as part of that. And, I'm doing developing software with, with <span style="color:red" data-ts="266.245" data-end_ts="266.465" title="266.245" id=c_"266.245">__eye__</span> plug and, I plug, needs and update. So, you know, I'm, I'm kind of able to use, you know, one, one facet of my activities in another one and, kind kill two birds with one stone at the moment. My, my current obsession is, is the new version of ipl, which, is receiving quite a lot of work 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now. That originally, came out of the, I don't even know how to pronounce name. Is it, is it, is it Kos or Kos or, I don't <span style="color:red" data-ts="294.785" data-end_ts="294.865" title="294.785" id=c_"294.785">__know__</span> how you say that, but the 
</p>

<p>
<b>Oli: </b>Reaper, it's the Reaper people, right? I'd say, yeah. It was originally developed by, a guy called John Schwartz, who goes by the name Schwar, and he's now, now one of the main developers of Reaper alongside Justin Frankel. And they, they, I think it was mainly John Schwartz's project, but, <span style="color:red" data-ts="315.485" data-end_ts="315.705" title="315.485" id=c_"315.485">__but__</span> it uses lots of, I think called WDL or Whittle. They've got lots of, lots of strange acronyms for their bits of software <laugh>. Anyway, he uses a lot, lots of their kind of library. It's all the code that they use to make Reaper, basically. I see. Or the open source side. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, what is, what is peculiar about the IPL system that made you focus on it rather than just using a standard plugin framework? Do 
</p>

<p>
<b>Oli: </b>You mean just using, the APIs directly or, 'cause I mean, I, I Plugin Juice are really the only two plugin frameworks that are publicly available. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, that, that are across that, that work on multiple, or have multiple output targets, you mean? Yeah. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Oli: </b>Originally I started making plugins using some software called Syn, which, is a great piece of software that's, you know, it's developed by a guy called Jeff McClintock. And this is kind of how I got into programming really. I think even I started using Synth <span style="color:red" data-ts="371.455" data-end_ts="371.655" title="371.455" id=c_"371.455">__Didit__</span> round about the same time as Max, but I made a load of stuff with it. Then eventually I wanted to make plugins that worked on Mac as well as Windows. 'cause <span style="color:red" data-ts="379.255" data-end_ts="379.455" title="379.255" id=c_"379.255">__since__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="379.455" data-end_ts="379.615" title="379.455" id=c_"379.455">__that__</span> it is Windows only. Okay. So I, started making plugins using Plug <span style="color:red" data-ts="385.135" data-end_ts="385.335" title="385.135" id=c_"385.135">__Go__</span>. And then, you know, I, I had <span style="color:red" data-ts="386.975" data-end_ts="387.255" title="386.975" id=c_"386.975">__sell__</span>, sold some stuff, and I had, you know, people interested in the things I was making, and I really wanted to, to make the products as as professional as I possibly could. And at the end of the day, that means, you know, getting as close to the bone as possible and basically getting your hands dirty and doing c plus plus. And at that time, I, I mean, I, I didn't have a background in c plus plus programming, so, I kind of, kept on trying to make, make things, using different SDKs, but obviously you want a, a solution to, to do all of the different plugin formats. And I found Eye Plug at this time and, it was the most, immediate one to me. Interesting. So that's why I got started with that. Is, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Did you start, did you start that before, before Juice became available? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Oli: </b>No Juice was available, but, at that time it was, it was a one man show and, I mean, it wasn't quite as, developed as it is now. I mean, so to be honest, I could have saved myself about five years worth of work if I'd just <span style="color:red" data-ts="452.245" data-end_ts="452.535" title="452.245" id=c_"452.245">__used__</span> juice. But, I learned a lot about programming by, by taking eye plug and trying to update it and add various formats and fix bugs and stuff like that. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>No, it sounds to me though, that you actually, it was when you started using I plugin, started doing these kind of native based, plugins, that's really when you started c plus plus programming. So how much of that was just learning c plus plus at dms and how, how much of it was implementing DSP? I mean, my, my sense of it would be that a lot of that, at least, you know, a significant portion of that time would've been just kind of getting up to doing commercial level c plus plus development. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Oli: </b>To be honest, I, the way I got into it was, actually making modules for Synthetic and externals for mac. So before I was developing VST plugins, I was making these smaller components that, you know, had a more limited functionality. So I kind of built up my understanding of programming like that. And, and actually prior to that I was doing a lot of JavaScript stuff in Mac. So yeah, I sort of gradually built it up and, I mean, I made a lot of mistakes <laugh>, but, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, but it sounds like it was sort of also, yeah, it sounds like it was also a gradual maturity in programming because Synthe and Max are kind of very approachable ways to do, to some basic programming concepts. And like you said, with Plugin mm-hmm. <affirmative>, you could, and with synthe you could get, you could get to the point of making some plugins, but then you kind of hit a wall at some point. It, it sounded like you had this kind of graduated mechanism of getting to the point of being, being a, being a programmer. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Oli: </b>Yeah, definitely. And I, I still got a bit of a complex about it. Like I, you know, I feel like I'm an imposter or imposter syndrome, is it <laugh>? Right? But, but then, you know, other people like, what you do c plus plus, that's voodoo and Right. I'm like, no, it's not, it's not really <laugh>. But, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now kind of in a, in a similar but completely different vein, you're also involved in the development of this, <span style="color:red" data-ts="592.385" data-end_ts="592.605" title="592.385" id=c_"592.385">__of__</span> something called web audio modules, which is using web audio technologies to make sort of like pluggable synthesizers, if I'm getting it right. Am I sort of getting it right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Oli: </b>Yes. It's essentially a kind of A-A-V-S-T plugin style entity for web audio. I dunno how much your listeners will know about web audio, but basically it's, it's this kind of audio graph based, DSP system that's, actually widely available in most of the browsers that we we use these days. And it's, it's kind of replaced flash audio for web-based stuff. It's remarkably similar to something like MAX or pd. It's pretty cool. There's lots of interesting things that people have made with it. But the web audio API specifies lots of nodes, which are kind of at the level of maybe a, a max external or a, a synthetic object so <span style="color:red" data-ts="652.925" data-end_ts="653.085" title="652.925" id=c_"652.925">__that__</span> they might be a, an oscillator or a filter and there's not really any kind of entity that could be an instrument or an effect with lots of parameters. I went to the, the first ever web audio conference, at <span style="color:red" data-ts="669.105" data-end_ts="669.325" title="669.105" id=c_"669.105">__ear__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="669.345" data-end_ts="669.565" title="669.345" id=c_"669.345">__cam__</span> several years ago, I guess two or three years ago. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Oli: </b>And I saw a presentation by this guy called Yaari Ola, who, is my collaborator on the, the WHAM project and Right. It's, it's mainly him to be honest, but, I'm like the, the hype man. I think it's really cool. <laugh> and, <laugh>, he gave a presentation at <span style="color:red" data-ts="689.605" data-end_ts="689.765" title="689.605" id=c_"689.605">__this__</span> first, first web audio conference where he'd got loads of plugins, desktop plugins working in the web browser. The interfaces basically looked the same and the audio was the same. Yeah, you can play them via web midi. What he'd done it, he'd used a technology called M scripting, which is, developed by someone at Mozilla and well, quite a lot of people at Mozilla probably. And it's, it's a technology that allows you to, to convert, c plus plus code into JavaScript. And yeah, he'd, got this kind of pipeline going where he was converting the, the code from some open source desktop plugins, so they ran as a webpage. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Oli: </b>That's got quite a lot of exciting potential. I think we're not quite there yet with the web audio stuff being powerful enough to, to run A-A-D-A-W that could compete with a desktop DAW. Right. But I think we might be a lot closer to that in five or 10 years time. So we want to make an API for doing, doing these kinds of instruments and effects like you can with VST plugins. <span style="color:red" data-ts="753.245" data-end_ts="753.445" title="753.245" id=c_"753.245">__We__</span>, we want to get that right, at an early, early stage. So it is a completely open thing and we are inviting people to collaborate with us. So yeah, af after I met Jari the first time, we, you know, got on quite well 'cause we both like, like 80 synthesizers <laugh>, and we, we decided to, to formulate a, a proper API to write plugins in c plus plus and then make them loadable by hosts and, make 'em communicate <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, it does. The one thing I'm curious about is, yeah. So I understand now about building the synths. How do, how would people like hook this up within their website? I mean, is there, is it just a, a regular, web audio API node then? Or is it something higher level than that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Oli: </b>When we compile a a a wham a web audio module, we are using a technology that's the final addition to the web audio 1.1 spec, which is this thing called the Audio Worklet. This is, a node on the web audio graph that lets you do custom DSP in a, a way that doesn't make your, audio glitch. So previously there was a thing called the script processor node, which allowed you to do the same thing, but basically the, the audio processing was, wasn't on the right thread. So if you started playing some notes <span style="color:red" data-ts="837.705" data-end_ts="837.925" title="837.705" id=c_"837.705">__on__</span> your web audio module synthesizer, and then you, maximized your browser window or, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="843.805" data-end_ts="844.245" title="843.805" id=c_"843.805">__something__</span>, the browser had to redraw something, it would totally glitch out the audio. So yeah, if you wanna try that, you can, you can go to web audio modules.org and, you'll find a, a version of my <span style="color:red" data-ts="855.005" data-end_ts="855.365" title="855.005" id=c_"855.005">__<inaudible>__</span> emulation, which, will glitch like crazy if you try and do anything <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see. Well, it's interesting because I was actually gonna ask you about the the Cassio thing, because one of the things I've noticed that's like a through line in a lot of your work is these different homages to the, cz Cassio synth series. What is, was that like your first synth, or is that just the sound that caught your attention? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Oli: </b>No, it wasn't my first synth. I don't really know why I got hooked on Casio CZs. I think it's, it's an amazing piece of engineering by the Casio engineers. It's a really neat, and powerful synthesis engine that was very, very clever. I mean, obviously the DX series and, the, the FM synthesis technology and, theory developed by John, John Chaing is amazing. But, the ca you know, Casios Feast distortion is really, really neat technique. And, in terms of playability and controllability, it's, it's pretty amazing. And, you know, they made these entirely digital syn in 1984 that's could get some quite analog sounds and, you know, were pretty much band limited, which is pretty cool. Kinda 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Remarkable for the time. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Oli: </b>Yeah, I mean, I think, yeah, I got into it 'cause I was, I was teaching audio synthesis and kind of going through different techniques and I just thought these, resonant waveforms that you get on these, on the Cassio syns were, were quite an interesting thing. And gradually I turned it into a Max Patch, and, you know, made it polyphonic and stuff and then made a max <span style="color:red" data-ts="957.485" data-end_ts="957.645" title="957.485" id=c_"957.485">__for__</span> live device. And, you know, I was starting to get sounds that are really quite close to the real, the, you know, the factory patches on the, on the CZ 1 0 1 Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So at some stage, I, you know, I may as well go go one step further and make a, make a fully blown emulation because basically it was the one one synth that nobody had emulated properly. And yeah, I had an opportunity to, to collaborate with, with plugging boutique in Brighton. And, had a few different sort of half finished things including this. And this one seemed like potentially successful or potentially a good idea to, you know, turn into a fully blown <span style="color:red" data-ts="999.285" data-end_ts="999.775" title="999.285" id=c_"999.285">__product__</span> product. Sure. Most of the stuff I do is completely weird and esoteric and, you know, some drone musicians might like it, but, an emulation of, the Casio synthesizer that was many, many people's first syn, it's got a bit more broad appeal. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So you said something there that kind of caught my attention. You said that you like wanted to take stuff, stuff one step further. And I would say that when I look at a lot of your work, that kind of is a, that that's kind of a, a byline of a lot of your stuff is sort of like taking a concept maybe one step further. I'm a little curious, one of the things I like talking to people about in my podcast is, is kind of mm-Hmm. <affirmative> how they got to be the artists or builders or creators that they are. And in your case, I'm kind of curious because you obviously have, I mean, you say that you don't identify as a, as a musician, but you have Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> like some kind of innate love for music and audio. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you started off off not being a, a programmer, but that's your primary place. So I'm curious about how, you know, what your journey looks like. What, how did you get started? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Where did the interest in music and audio come from? Prior, even prior to being, involved in programming, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Oli: </b>I didn't exactly grow up in a, a musical <laugh>, musical family. I mean, my, my dad is passionate about music. He, he's got a vast record collection. He is just a, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1089.925" data-end_ts="1090.045" title="1089.925" id=c_"1089.925">__a__</span>, a hobbyist musician. But, you know, likes guitars and sitars and things like that. And, so I guess I was immersed in, in music that way. When I went to school. I started in secondary school. I was, you know, started playing guitar. Yeah. I kind of got into the recording side of things 'cause we had four tracks and, that, that kind of thing in, in the, in the music department at the school I was at. And yeah, just kind of got, got the bug of sort of building up a small collection of recording equipment. I played in a few bands at that time and at that stage I would've said, you know, I want to be a music producer. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Oli: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1127.825" data-end_ts="1128.045" title="1127.825" id=c_"1127.825">__Or__</span>, I was thinking at the time, I didn't think I was gonna be a programmer. 'cause I wasn't really that into that kind of, computing at the time. I mean, I was kind of, a teenager around the time that, you know, computers started being able to do real time audio and around when VST sort of came onto the scene. So I was trying these early DWS and things sort of really changed, I guess when I was about 17. And, and I dunno, 21 or 22, like the technology really, really changed quite a lot. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Where were you that you had access to some of these tools? 'cause one of the things that happened was, yeah, when this first stuff came out, it was all commercial. It all cost a pile of money and you had to kind of be either doing pretty well financially or in the right place to get access to these tools. Where where were you that gave you access? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Oli: </b>My school had, yeah, had an Atari, <laugh>. So I, I messed around with that a bit. I mean, we had a fairly basic, you know, windows pc when I was went to the sixth form my school, I really wanted to do music technology as my, we have a levels, which are what, what you do when you are sort of 17 and 18 in the school in uk. So these are kind of a kind of exam, your final exams that you take at school. So I really wanted to do music technology a level, which is, an option, but not an option at my school. So I, I went to the local college, so I was kind of, split between two institutions and that was the first time I got to use, proper recording studios, I guess. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1229.465" data-end_ts="1229.685" title="1229.465" id=c_"1229.465">__But__</span> I mean, they were, they were pretty good. But, but then I went to, to university and, got access to a lot more facilities. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The, your timing probably couldn't have been much better because there, you know, that time when VST programs that supported VST plugins and stuff all hit, Hmm. That was an amazing time period because things changed so fast. It went from being a recording studio, had to have like 20 pieces of external gear to now you could imagine pretty sophisticated recordings happening inside the box. Right? Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Oli: </b><affirmative>. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So as sort of like a fledgling production person with the idea of production, who were you recording at the time? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Oli: </b>I was actually, you know, playing a lot of guitar and, as I said, I, I would've considered myself a musician and a producer at, at that time. I was mainly working with, just on my own, to be honest. I was in a few bands playing guitar, but, made a few recording recordings of bands, but around where I lived, which is in the southeast of England. There was a bit of a, a rave scene, a party scene in, in the countryside. Lots of parties every weekend. And this kind of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1304.205" data-end_ts="1304.405" title="1304.205" id=c_"1304.205">__music__</span> called, where it's goer trance, or it was becoming side trance at the time. And that was very popular in the area where I'm from. Okay. And I was, I was really into it. And, there were lots of producers who I, who I really liked. And, I would, I would try and emulate their, their sounds in my, my productions. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Oli: </b>Yeah. I was mainly working on my own. And yeah, getting really into the details of, of electronic music production and trying to make the trippiest sounds possible. Basically <laugh>. But I, I thought I needed to go and study, electroacoustic music and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1339.605" data-end_ts="1339.765" title="1339.605" id=c_"1339.605">__the__</span>, the kind of tools that composers use from the kind of academic tradition. 'cause I thought I, I was introduced to some of that by one of my teachers at college, and I was like, whoa, these manipulations <span style="color:red" data-ts="1351.245" data-end_ts="1351.445" title="1351.245" id=c_"1351.245">__of__</span> sound are really amazing. And, if I wanna make really trippy music, I need to learn how to use phase vocoders <laugh>, unfortunately, that, that turned out, that turned out not to be very <laugh> rewarding. Turned 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Out not 
</p>

<p>
<b>Oli: </b>To be the case. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1364.005" data-end_ts="1364.205" title="1364.005" id=c_"1364.005">__Do__</span> you wanna make <laugh>? No. If you wanna make some kind of babbling brook watery, watery FFT sounds then Yeah. But, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Didn't work in sci trance though, <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Oli: </b>No, no. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So you started fishing around with that, but what, what was the transfer for you to then kind of put you in the place of not focusing on the music side and instead focusing on the programming? I mean, it seems like, you know, at least at this point in the story, you were still very much identifying yourself as a musician. What was the turning point for you that just said, I wanna focus on the technology side? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Oli: </b>I think it was probably the, the realization of yeah. That I wasn't particularly great <span style="color:red" data-ts="1412.005" data-end_ts="1412.205" title="1412.005" id=c_"1412.005">__at__</span> the, the music side of it. I find it so hard to sort of, to know when something's finished or to even finish something. I mean, I still occasionally love to, to mess around, you know, starting to make some music. But somehow the, the process of programming my own software, I got so absorbed in that, that, and it, it was so rewarding when you kind of finally finished something and, uploaded it and, you know, people liked it and it clearly did what it was meant to. There's nothing ambiguous, or, you know, music's so subjective. Whereas, you know, if a bit of code works, it works. If it doesn't work, it, it either doesn't make noise, crashes your computer or makes a really horrible noise, <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. The, the result is really clear. Right. You don't have to wait for Yeah. You don't have to wait for the crowd's approval to find out whether pro program's working or not. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1472.795" data-end_ts="1473.015" title="1472.795" id=c_"1472.795">__You__</span> know, that's actually really interesting. Yeah, that's an interesting point. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Oli: </b>Obviously you shouldn't really care about, you know, what other people think about your music, but, it's <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that's an ideal. Yeah. I don't know of anybody that actually follows that ideal <span style="color:red" data-ts="1486.525" data-end_ts="1486.815" title="1486.525" id=c_"1486.525">__that__</span> everybody cares what other people think. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Oli: </b><laugh>. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, it's just, I don't know, it didn't feel like my calling to just make music. I mean, I've got friends who it's just in their blood, like it, you know, it's, I mean, they, they have writer's block, I'm sure, but they just keep on doing it. There's, there's no question about stopping really. It's just what they do and Right. I kind of feel like I'm the same with programming now, but the music didn't come naturally to me, although I was still like, you know, passionate, and obsessive listener of music and, you know, always aspired to, to one day, you know, actually start making music again. And if I go to a gig and I don't think it's that great, I just think, oh, I could do way better than this <laugh>. Right. And then I don't, so, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, so now you're focused like very, very particularly on, on, on technological pursuits with, with audio, but it also seems like you do have your fingers in a lot of pies. And I noticed just from, you know, again, just doing I even a cursory drive-by just points to a lot of different offshoots of things that you're involved in. Hmm. So I noticed that at, at, some of the juice conferences, you actually were talking about, the Faust language and, . Supporting Faust, the Faust library, inside of, juice Builds. Why don't you explain really quickly what that, what that's about, what Faust is about and why you would even go through that effort? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Oli: </b>Okay. So Faust is a domain specific language for audio signal processing. And it's a functional programming language. It's a text-based language, so I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1594.255" data-end_ts="1594.375" title="1594.255" id=c_"1594.255">__guess__</span> more like Super Collider or than it is, like Max or pd. But what actually, you are describing block diagrams in false code, and it has a, a syntax for describing the way that, you know, a signal might fork or merge. You've got different ways of composing audio signals. So yeah, you'll describing an audio graph. Yeah. It's got a very expressive syntax. I'm not sure that's quite the right word, but, it's extremely powerful and you can do some very complex kind of routings in a very small amount of code. Yeah. IE discovered Faust through a max objects called Faust <span style="color:red" data-ts="1639.265" data-end_ts="1639.485" title="1639.265" id=c_"1639.265">__Gen__</span>, which isn't actually related to Gen Tilda in, in max, but it's using a similar technology, which is this, compiler technology called LLVM, which allows you to, to do a just in time compilation, which basically means that you can get very high performance code, on the fly rather than having to compile something offline in, X code or visual studio. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Oli: </b>So yeah, you can kind of script something inside Max and it, it gets compiled to very, optimized code on the fly. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, Faust Gen was quite interesting to me because I was in, I was doing some physical modeling stuff. I'm fascinated by physical modeling synthesis. And, one of the most appealing things about Faust is that it has a, a fantastic library of DSP routines, which are, largely developed at Stanford, by Julius Smith, who is, one of the best brains in the world for DSP. And like, you know, everyone will go to his pages to, to, you know, learn about particular kinds of filters or particular you certain kind of physical modeling, whatever. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, and here's a, a programming language that's actually got code written by him. So it's got like textbook quality examples. It's demonstrate, you know, almost everything's on his, his site. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Oli: </b>It's really, really great in that respect. I, both Jen Tilda and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1735.075" data-end_ts="1735.365" title="1735.075" id=c_"1735.075">__faus__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1735.425" data-end_ts="1735.645" title="1735.425" id=c_"1735.425">__Gen__</span> Tilda were quite exciting to me. 'cause as I'm sure you know, it's, it's nice being able to do this kind of low levels feedback and stuff without, you know, having to get your hands dirty with, c plus plus and having to go through this kind of offline compilation process, which can destroy the flow of ideas and that kind of thing. I had this projects, Pix, which was something that I started a long time ago. When I did a, an internship, in Paris at the, the GRM where they got me to do some research into, to preset interpolation, I, I ended up making a Max Patch to do it. And a library for Max, this was before the Nodes Object existed. Okay. So this is basically the same thing as the Nodes object. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Oli: </b>Anyway, I made that into a, an application which is on the, on the Mac app store. And, I always wanted to make loads of little devices for it that could work well with, with preset interpolation. And, I was really making things very quickly using Faust and I wanted to make the next version of pix. So the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1804.165" data-end_ts="1804.325" title="1804.165" id=c_"1804.165">__Juice__</span>, the Juice Library has a lot of great functionality for hosting your own plugins and doing all the kind of graph stuff. And I thought, well, if I can combine Faust and this JIT compilation stuff into my new version of Pix, then I can make something really cool <laugh> and, I, I made a, a juice module so that other people can do that as well. There isn't a way to, to JIT compile Faust stuff as a VST plugin other than, than Pix. So I, I kind of did it with that in mind. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1840.385" data-end_ts="1840.605" title="1840.385" id=c_"1840.385">__The__</span>, that project's kind of become a bit unclear what it is now. It's like a, is it a preset interpolator or is it a Faust IDE? It's currently, the code's currently rotting on, on GitHub and, I need to think about what to do with that. But, I'm distracted with other things at the moment, so, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So what, for you, what was the draw of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1863.465" data-end_ts="1863.685" title="1863.465" id=c_"1863.465">__oth__</span>? Was it just getting close to the hardware, the move from like graphical programming languages like synthetic or Max to 
</p>

<p>
<b>Oli: </b>Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>C plus plus and Faust. I mean, it sounds like Faust isn't necessarily closer to the hardware, although I guess the LLVM compiling would do that, but what, is there something about textural languages that you find, like is it more elegant or more efficient, or has your brain changed to more embrace that style of programming? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Oli: </b>Yeah, that's a good question. I mean, it's more manageable from my perspective. You know, I was making, making plugins with Syn and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1902.465" data-end_ts="1902.685" title="1902.465" id=c_"1902.465">__Max__</span> and with those platforms, although they're, they're great. And they're fantastic tools for artists and people. I mean, you, you can make professional software with, with those tools, but at the end of the day, if, if someone's got a, if one of your customers has got a problem and it's in <span style="color:red" data-ts="1920.765" data-end_ts="1920.965" title="1920.765" id=c_"1920.765">__the__</span> part of the code that you don't have control over, then I don't know, something is wrong about turning around to that customer saying, look, I'm sorry. It's, it's not my, not my problem. I, I can't do anything about it. Right. So being in control of those things is quite important. I think if you're selling software, you should take that responsibility. So that's, that's one reason for it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Oli: </b>And, you know, getting so much <span style="color:red" data-ts="1944.605" data-end_ts="1944.845" title="1944.605" id=c_"1944.605">__into__</span> tech space programming, you know, going back to, to making a, a max perch and having wires all over the place, it just feels unmanageable. <laugh> and my brain has changed. I think I've, I, when I make a Max patch, I mean, I still use Max absolutely loads. I've been using it a lot for my PhD work. I, I often end up with these max patches that have got sort of one, one object and then some controls going into that object. It might be a, a JavaScript thing or maybe a, an external that I made, or a faus gen. And then there's, you know, not much going on in in the next patch itself. So your brain does change. I think <span style="color:red" data-ts="1983.605" data-end_ts="1983.765" title="1983.605" id=c_"1983.605">__when__</span> once you can kind of be in control of the code at a lower level, sure. You start to see how you can implement things more simply and concisely and make it more maintainable. There 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Certainly is a different organizational scheme that comes with, with textual programming, that's for 
</p>

<p>
<b>Oli: </b>Sure. Yeah. I don't want to <laugh> say bad things about any of these things. I love, love them all, but you know, they, although Faust can write extremely concise code, you know, at the moment it's not so easy to debug stuff in Faust. But you know, there's only a few people working on it and hopefully one day it <span style="color:red" data-ts="2019.045" data-end_ts="2019.205" title="2019.045" id=c_"2019.045">__will__</span>, it will be. But, so they've all got their advantages and, disadvantages. But the kind of position I'm in, it's beneficial for me to be able to dip in and out of all, all these different things. And so I really appreciate the functionality that, that everything gives me. And, if I'm making a product, I'll probably do it in c plus plus, but if I'm experimenting, prototyping, or making something that's on a kind of ad hoc basis, then I may well use other, other languages. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So you're given the number of different things in <span style="color:red" data-ts="2049.315" data-end_ts="2049.605" title="2049.315" id=c_"2049.315">__what__</span>, we didn't even get into the <inaudible> and immersive audio stuff, but our time is already shot. I can't believe it. But before we go, I'm curious for a person in your position where you are working simultaneously with a lot of the technologies. You're kind of deep into the research world, but you're also doing some commercial stuff. You have kind of tendrils into a lot of parts of music technology. I'm curious from your, from your perspective, you know, sometimes I ask people where do they think the future's going? But in your case, I would like to ask it a slightly different way. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, what direction would you like it to go? I mean, there, there seems to be a lot of people fishing around with things like machine learning and AI systems. There also is a lot of experimentation with, with different, you know, with pushing the envelope on different kinds of synthesis mechanisms or, or programming languages and programming techniques. What are, what is it that you are most interested in seeing grow and develop? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Oli: </b>I think, well, one thing I would say, you know, part of my, my efforts with eye <span style="color:red" data-ts="2125.765" data-end_ts="2126.045" title="2125.765" id=c_"2125.765">__plug__</span>, have been about basically making it a lot easier to, to get into programming your own stuff with languages like c plus plus. And there's been lots, lots of changes that have made that much more approachable than it was when I started. And so, yeah, I would like low-level programming to be a bit less of a mysterious voodoo thing, you know, more people to get into that. In this day and age, it's, it's just such a useful skill to be able to do a bit of c plus plus or JavaScript. You know, I've, I've taught a lot of institutions where working with musicians or the students <span style="color:red" data-ts="2161.545" data-end_ts="2161.765" title="2161.545" id=c_"2161.545">__are__</span>, you know, coming from a mu musical background and yeah, just trying to get people to get into, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2166.665" data-end_ts="2166.885" title="2166.665" id=c_"2166.665">__to__</span> programming and to not think it, not see it as a, this frightening thing that's not for them. Like being able to, to get your hands dirty with, with these low level things much more easily, is one, one thing that I, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2179.035" data-end_ts="2179.325" title="2179.035" id=c_"2179.035">__well__</span>, it's already happening and I, I hope it, it happens more and more and more. So yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You just want the world to be more like you, is what you're saying. <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Oli: </b>I dunno about that. But, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well Ali, I wanna thank you so much for taking the time to, to have a chat. This was a lot of fun and it was <span style="color:red" data-ts="2201.405" data-end_ts="2201.605" title="2201.405" id=c_"2201.405">__all__</span>, it was really interesting to get to hear sort of your perspectives on stuff and just get a chance to hear all the different ways that you're experimenting with the world of sound. It was really great, man. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Oli: </b>Alright, well yeah, thanks. It was, nice talking to you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>All right. Okay. And with that I will say goodbye then. Bye 
</p>

<p>
<b>Oli: </b>Bye. Darwin, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I want to thank Ali for the chance to talk and learn a little bit more about all the different things that he does. It was really interesting. I wanna thank you the listeners for showing up again this week for continuing to show up. The numbers are really great. I also wanna really thank opia.com whose help has really upped the numbers and really gotten a lot more people interested in the podcast. I'm gonna be taking a week off, so, next week is going to be a no podcast week. We'll be coming back to you on April the 15th. And, with that I'm gonna let you go. Thank you so much and we'll catch you next time around. Bye.
