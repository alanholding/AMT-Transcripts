      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Okay. This week, we are talking to somebody who I respect so greatly. His name's Mark Vail. He is an author. He was part of the editorial staff of Keyboard Magazine for years. He is knowledgeable about so many things and he's a person who has actually met history in so many ways. So I'm really excited to be able to have this conversation with Mark Vail. Mark, how are you? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark Vail: </b>
      Great Darwin. Thanks a lot for this opportunity.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Well thank you for being part of it. It's a real honor for me. Generally speaking with these podcasts, what I like to do is sort of introduce you to the listeners by having you tell us something about your background. Now I'm particularly interested in this because you have done so many things that I find fascinating. So if you could fill us in a little bit on your background in history and some of the things you've done in the past, as well as what you're working on currently. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>
      Okay. I grew up in downstate Illinois, took piano lessons as a kid, but unfortunately I didn't keep up on it. Took voice lessons for an extended period of time. So as far as music is concerned, I'm much better trained as a tenor vocalist than as a keyboard player. But, in my later years of high school, I discovered synthesizers and the idea of having an electronic instrument that could make all these different sounds really fascinated me. And I didn't really take anything in college - undergraduate work that was related to music or synthesizers. But later on, I did get a master's degree, from Mills College in Oakland, California, and a master's degree on fine arts and studied with people like Gordon Muma and David Rosenboom, Lou Harrison, who was a fabulous composer, American composer. And I moved from from Illinois.
    </p>

    <p>
      I ended up for a couple of years in Miami, Florida, which, was when I discovered that Keyboard Magazine existed. And I applied twice to work for Keyboard Magazine while I was still in Florida. It didn't work out, but I remembered the San Francisco Bay area from a trip that my family took in 1963 when I was eight years old. And I just always wanted to live there. And that's where Keyboard Magazine was being published. I was able to move across the country, for a job and move to the Bay area and, met my wife and got married in 1987. She was going through the newspaper and found an ad - Keyboard Magazine was looking for an editor and everything worked out for me. Dominic Milano was the editor in chief at the time. And he hired me in early January of 1988.
    </p>

    <p>
      And that changed my life. I was there until April of 2001. I'd say in about 1991, Bob Moog, the great pioneer of synthesizers, was writing a column called Vintage Synth. He had written, I don't know, he wrote at least half a dozen different columns for Keyboard Magazine over the years, but he wrote four of these columns called Vintage Synths. And then he told Dominic that he really didn't want to look to the past anymore. Bob wanted to look forward to the future. And I don't know how I was so fortunate, but Dominic gave the column to me. And not only was it fabulous to work at Keyboard Magazine, but that column falling into my lap opened up amazing doors and allowed me to interview people, who were seminal and very important in the electronic music industry. Many of them are not with us anymore.
    </p>

    <p>
      And, the other fortunate thing is I've been able to write books about instruments that some people might consider obsolete. I don't think anything that can still make sound and still be used to make music is obsolete. But whereas I have friends who will write a book about the latest version of Pro Tools or, or Ableton Live or something like that. By the time the book comes out, there's a new version of the software out. So the book itself is obsolete. So it's been very fortunate for me to be able to write about vintage instruments like Moog synthesizers and Hammond organs and things like that, because the information does not go stale. It stays relevant.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Yeah. For the listeners that aren't familiar, Mark has written three books. The first one was, I think your first book was Vintage Synthesizers, right?  </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>
      Yes, sir. It was.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>It was sort of an amazing turning point because those of us who had maintained an interest in analog and older synthesizers were just so happy that it was getting it's historical due, because there was a timeframe where everything old was immediately being tossed out for the excitement of the new - and Mark's Vintage Synthesizers book actually came along and established the idea that these vintage synthesizers were not only, desirable, but actually had qualities that were very unique and weren't necessarily being replaced by a newer technology. You followed that up with a book on the Hammond B3 organ, which - I'll tell you Mark. It was actually a really important book to me. I was involved in the documentation of Native Instruments B4 organ plugin. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>I had had some experience with Hammond organs, but the process of putting together that documentation... I just enveloped myself in all-things-Hammond. And your book was literally by my side through that whole process as both an inspiration and a tool for generating ideas about how I could properly and usefully document this plugin: not only in how it works, but how it fit within the sort of historic fabric of the Hammonds history, the Hammonds long and incredible history. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>The most recent book is called The Synthesizer and it is probably the most comprehensive compendium of synthesizer information going back from the historical beginnings of synthesis through, the most current software-based synthesizers, as well as how a modular synthesizer works. So, three books that really are Mark Stone marking stones, I think, for our understanding and historical memory of these systems now, what is it? So Bob wanting to move away from that article opened the door for you to interact with them. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>Did you have, did you have a particular, love of working with these systems anyway? Or is it something that developed over the process of working on these articles? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>
      Well, like I say, four years before I started working at Keyboard Magazine, I had great interest in synthesizers and I had - my first synthesizer was a MiniMoog, which was an analog monophonic instrument, which means it can play one note at a time, but what an awesome starting point. I couldn't have picked better. And what happened is, and this kind of ties back to what you were saying about a period when people craved new instruments and tossed out the old ones. The turning point came in 1983 when Yamaha introduced the DX-7 synthesizer. It was one of the first affordable digital synthesizers. And it could make sounds that were very difficult for analog synthesizers to create. And I can't say it damaged, but it just redirected the focus of most people in the music industry who thought that analog was dead - analog sound production, using voltage controlled oscillators and filters and onto look generators, the essence of analog synthesis that they thought it was dead.
    </p>

    <p>
      And like I say, I was fortunate for Bob Moog to start that column and it came to me. But, during my years at Keyboard, there was this fabulous turnaround, I would say beginning in the early nineties that everybody started realizing that analog was actually pretty cool. And two things that the DX-7 did away with were real time controllers - knobs, and sliders, and, things like that - that synthesists used while creating sounds and also performing did away with those. You had a keyboard that sensed how hard you hit and also how hard you pushed on the notes, the keys after you'd played them. Those would control things. And you had the typical wheels that Moog introduced: one to control the pitch of the notes that you were playing. And then the other one controlling modifiers, like, inducing vibrato, or opening up the filter or things like that. It had those, but no more. Did you have knobs that you could grab and adjust as you were, as you were playing sound? The other thing it introduced was a deep menu system that you had to dig down into define all of these different parameters that affected the sound so that, like I said, people were thrilled by the new sounds that they could make, but the synthesis methods of the DX-7 specifically used linear frequency modulation, which was beyond the typical synthesist's idea of how to make sounds.
    </p>

    -----

    <p>
      <b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_02: </b>Right. Now one, before we move on, I'm actually curious about, about your opinion on something, which is, now in historical context, we look back and we say, wow, we lost an awful lot when the DX seven
      concept, took hold. And in retrospect it kind of looks like maybe we all went insane for awhile, right? Because we, we dropped nods and we dropped like filter cutoff and all this stuff, but clearly at the time, and you know, this
      is I w I started off as a guitarist and a recording engineer and came to keyboards as a compositional tool. And so, for me, my recollection is mostly about the effect that <span style="color:red" data-ts="835.35"
        data-end_ts="835.8" title="835.35" id=c_"835.35">__middy__</span> had at the time. But clearly there were things that were significant about the DX seven that made it really desirable. Now, I think some of it might've been stylistic because
      you couldn't do a, a Lionel Richie ballad without a <span style="color:red" data-ts="850.5" data-end_ts="851.19" title="850.5" id=c_"850.5">__jangly__</span> DX seven in the background. Right.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>But,
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_02: </b>I mean, to what extent do you think that some of the things there were important things that the DX seven introduced, like significant polyphony and, an interaction with Mitt with the new kid on the block
      of <span style="color:red" data-ts="871.2" data-end_ts="871.71" title="871.2" id=c_"871.2">__middy__</span>?
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>No. One of the things that the <span style="color:red" data-ts="874.91" data-end_ts="875.85" title="874.91" id=c_"874.91">__***<inaudible>***__</span> an example of how popular it was that one of the factory patches, sounded like a
      fender Rhodes electro-acoustic piano. And it got to the point where that sound was used on so many records that when people actually did hear a fender Rhodes, they thought something's wrong with that.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>That doesn't sound right. But the introduction of MITIE really expanded, the production of electronic music in ways that it had never done before, because many manufacturers, including, Tom Oberheim and sequential circuits and Mo
      music and our, Eleanor R Perlman's company, they were trying to develop, ways to control what the sound was doing. But it wasn't until Dave Smith, began trying to introduce a, general purpose system that with, with eco star Kakehashi at Roland,
      they developed <span style="color:red" data-ts="961.07" data-end_ts="961.85" title="961.07" id=c_"961.07">__MITIE__</span> and it took some time for other manufacturers to get on board, but enough of them did and convince those that, that
      didn't accept middy at first to come on board middy, standing for a musical instrument, digital interface. And what that allows you to do is connect more than one device like synthesizers and play all of them from the same keyboard, or to
      record what you play into a computer where you can edit it and play it back and everything. So, the introduction of MITIE in 1983, just expanded the capabilities of electronic music instruments in way that in ways that had never been seen
      before, and it was actually, economical enough that manufacturers could implement that and put it on an instrument that really wasn't any more expensive than an instrument that didn't have many. So it really lit the fire on the electronic music
      industry and expanded it like it never had before.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_02: </b>Right. Well, and, you know, again, my movie was what really drew me into using keyboards because then that allowed me to work on compositions without necessarily having to get the band together. Right. It, that was a
      pretty tremendous, game changer for me. And I think for a lot of people. And so even though I wasn't primarily keyboardist, you know, particularly through the mitigation of, of computer-based that really opened up some interesting doors, but it
      also meant that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1076.19" data-end_ts="1076.76" title="1076.19" id=c_"1076.19">__middy__</span> ended up being sort of like, at least initially for me, and for a lot of people <span style="color:red"
        data-ts="1081.59" data-end_ts="1082.04" title="1081.59" id=c_"1081.59">__MITIE__</span> ended up being kind of the, the fence where if something had <span style="color:red" data-ts="1088.61" data-end_ts="1088.91" title="1088.61"
        id=c_"1088.61">__middy__</span>, I could consider it for my studio, if it didn't, it really wasn't going to be a player. And, that was, that was where for me, and I think maybe a lot of people, that's why some of the older instruments got
      kind of put away or sold off for scrap at least for a while, would <span style="color:red" data-ts="1112.52" data-end_ts="1112.61" title="1112.52" id=c_"1112.52">__you__</span>?
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1112.63" data-end_ts="1112.84" title="1112.63" id=c_"1112.63">__Yes__</span>, I do. I would. And it's funny. Well, we're still working with version. One of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1121.81"
        data-end_ts="1122.29" title="1121.81" id=c_"1121.81">__MITIE__</span> came out in 1983, now it's 2014. It's, it's over 30 years old and people keep saying, when are we going to see a version two of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1136.06"
        data-end_ts="1136.51" title="1136.06" id=c_"1136.06">__Medi__</span> the MIDI manufacturer's association, a nonprofit organization that, that keeps, anybody who wants to use middy in line and not doing things with it, they shouldn't not do
      right. There have still been developments that are, that are important. One thing that may have helped, I mean, in, like I said, in the 1990s, analog synthesis started to return to popularity. And also you mentioned earlier modular
      synthesizers, Bob mugs and Don <span style="color:red" data-ts="1175.57" data-end_ts="1175.93" title="1175.57" id=c_"1175.57">__was__</span> first synthesizers were modular systems where you had to buy the individual parts, had to buy an
      oscillator. You had to buy a filter. Although Don booklet didn't call them those things that the people were familiar with, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1190.6" data-end_ts="1190.93" title="1190.6" id=c_"1190.6">__mug__</span> technology,
      he, Bob, Don Buka kind of used his own terminology, but you would buy these individual parts and put them in a box and then you'd have to use Pat's cables to connect them before you could make any sound or make anything happen.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>That technology, what was also severely beat down by the popularity of digital synthesizers, like the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1218.98" data-end_ts="1219.55" title="1218.98" id=c_"1218.98">__***<inaudible>***__</span>, but,
      they came back strong. I, I give a lot of credit to Dieter deffer in Germany, for bringing back modular synthesizers. He took ideas, well, specifications that were used in German industries, like, electronics that go into trains or ships or
      things like that. They had these specifications that Dieter deffer borrowed to make a new modular format called Eurorack. And that's that there are numerous different formats of modular synthesizers, but you're <span style="color:red"
        data-ts="1267.94" data-end_ts="1268.08" title="1267.94" id=c_"1267.94">__all__</span> rock is by far the most popular. And I think some of the neatest ideas are being implemented in your rack modular since modules. But like you were saying,
      if something didn't have <span style="color:red" data-ts="1283.86" data-end_ts="1284.16" title="1283.86" id=c_"1283.86">__middy__</span>, then people might not be interested in using it, but there have been developments, where people are
      creating devices that can convert <span style="color:red" data-ts="1300.33" data-end_ts="1300.72" title="1300.33" id=c_"1300.33">__MIDI__</span> data into Con to control analog modules and vice versa, take the output of analog modules and
      convert that into <span style="color:red" data-ts="1310.83" data-end_ts="1311.34" title="1310.83" id=c_"1310.83">__middy__</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>And they come in, hardware devices and also software, which I know you're very familiar with yourself with your work that you do Darwin, but, yeah, it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1326.85" data-end_ts="1327.39"
        title="1326.85" id=c_"1326.85">__Mitty__</span>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1327.39" data-end_ts="1327.71" title="1327.39" id=c_"1327.39">__Middy__</span> is everywhere. I have to tell you, and I'm sorry to veer off the road. I hope we
      can get on track, but I spent, actually more than seven years working on the synthesizer book. And I had to put a number of projects aside, including actually playing with synthesizers. And I have, I have to admit, I have too many toys. I have
      more musical instruments than most people could imagine. And I haven't spent enough time with them as, as, as much time as I should. But this week I have arranged for my first book signing event for the synthesizer. And as I have done in the
      past, when I've had a book signing, there has to be live music involved.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>So, I live in Sacramento, California. We're about Oh, 35, 40 miles away from, a town called Davis, which is also in the central Valley and in California. And there is a university of California branch there. Yeah. And they have
      this fabulous bookstore that I found out about called the avid reader. And on Friday night, April 11th, right now we're talking about starting at seven 30, we're going to have a book signing there. My good friends, David Batino, who's also a
      synthesis <span style="color:red" data-ts="1437.74" data-end_ts="1437.91" title="1437.74" id=c_"1437.74">__and__</span> a journalist and also a fabulous jazz guitarist from San Francisco named Michael grow. We're going to play some music at
      this book signing. And since I've neglected my instruments for so much over the past few years, today, I spent a lot of time getting things working. And some, some of the devices that I'm planning on using have Medi and some of them don't,
      middy is very useful. If you want to synchronize, for example, a drum machine with a sequenced pattern and a sense of sizer, but I made a joke one time to David Batino, that, you know, sink is overrated. Sometimes it's fun. Sometimes if it's
      fun, if things aren't perfectly sync,
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>I would agree because lot of times when you do it that way you end up with the happy accident that just is charming and that you could have never considered doing, you know, intellectually. That's great. Okay. So
        this is again, it's April 11th, April 11th. And that's that? That's at the, that's an in Davis, California, and the name of the bookstore again, </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>The avid reader. Avid reader. Okay. Yeah.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Those of you out there who are within driving range, and I know that there's a lot of people out there, in the Bay area, particularly that could get out there for easily. That, that sounds like <span style="color:red"
          data-ts="1534.39" data-end_ts="1534.75" title="1534.39" id=c_"1534.39">__brilliant__</span>, awesome thing. David Boutino is such a sweetheart too. So it's cool that you're working with him on this as well. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>We David and I, we get together not as often as we would like, he has two kids, I have two dogs and, you know, we we'd love to get together at least once a month, but we have done these things. We have jam sessions, sometimes we'll
      invite somebody else, like a saxophone player or something like that. Cause I love to mix acoustics with electronics. Right. But he challenged me several years ago. First it was a pocket jam. What you could carry in your pocket was the only
      thing you could do. And he had his, well, first of all, we are both fans of the chord chaos later, a little little instrument. That's just, just, I, I think it's a synthesizer, even though you can't go in and you can't change all the
      parameters, but it's an, it's an real-time instrument that you can start drum patterns and you can adjust how they play and you can record inside it how your motions on this two dimensional, touchpad and control it and recorded in there.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>But when you shut it off, you lose all your, your stuff. So it's, it's just kind of a, a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1626.75" data-end_ts="1627.38" title="1626.75" id=c_"1626.75">__real-time__</span> thing. And <span
        style="color:red" data-ts="1628.1" data-end_ts="1628.52" title="1628.1" id=c_"1628.1">__chord__</span> has taken that idea through a number of devices, chaos, pads, chaos, laters. So David and I both have those, but this was kind of when iOS
      in things like the Apple iPhone and the iPod touch were getting powerful enough to do, some pretty sophisticated synthesis. And, and this was, this was 2010. So we've had four years of further developments. And, I didn't, I have an iPod touch.
      I had a chaos later, but I wanted to use something different. I'm a big fan of Dave Smith instruments, Dave Smith, like I said earlier, he was the King pin behind the development of MITIE, but his first company was sequential circuits, which,
      introduced the first polyphonic. Programmable synthesizer was called a prophet five.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>And I came out with that in 1977. I think I've got that date right. And sequential circuits introduced many fabulous, electronic instruments over the years, but I believe they closed in 1989, somewhere around there. And Dave Smith
      was involved with other companies. But he finally started the new company under his own name. And he's come out with all these fabulous instruments again. But he, he introduced this little <span style="color:red" data-ts="1743.08"
        data-end_ts="1743.83" title="1743.08" id=c_"1743.08">__mano__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1743.85" data-end_ts="1744.46" title="1743.85" id=c_"1743.85">__synth__</span> module called the mofo. And, and the other stipulation that
      David had was it has to be battery powered. We're gonna, we're gonna meet, we're gonna meet in a coffee shop. And w you know, they would not care for you to come in and plug in something and use their AC. So it had to be pocket sized and
      battery powered. Well, the mofo is not really pocket size. So I, I had to break that rule a little bit, but I did, did have to do some work to use battery power, to power that thing. And so it actually took a combination of, AA battery, units.
      I think 10 is the biggest thing that you can buy at a, an electronic store to power something with, well, I had to, I had to use 12 batteries to get enough voltage.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>And so I had to wire the same together, but I actually made it work.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>So did you have to like buy special cargo pants in order to fit all of those things in <span style="color:red" data-ts="1819.59" data-end_ts="1820.04" title="1819.59" id=c_"1819.59">__backup__</span>? </i>

      <b>Mark: </b>Well, I, like I said, I already broke the law, but we had this fabulous jam session on a tabletop, in a coffee shop, and we recorded it with a little, little zoom and Adderall recorders. Right. And you know, what I've learned over
      the years is that limitations can be so beneficial. You can have so many instruments to play with that. Your mind doesn't focus as well as it does. If you're limited to one or two, possibly three instruments at a time, and you, you concentrate
      on what you're doing and the results are, are better than they are for you. If you have 10 different instruments that you're trying to juggle at the same time,
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>I think you're so right with that. I think another corollary to that is by, giving up control. Sometimes that gives you the freedom to be creative, but if you have too much control, then you focus on controlling
        instead of like creation. I certainly feel that way about, about trying to do a lot of SU synthesis, parameter changes within like a DAW software package that once I like dive into this hyper control mode, all of a sudden I lose, I feel like
        I almost can feel the creativity slipping away as I'm turning from artists to engine here, you know? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>Yes, yes. I understand that. Yeah.
    </p>

    -----

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>And so the, one of the cool things about these small devices is you kind of limited in the number of controls you have, but it's frees you to say, well, I'm going to make the most use out of my can. And oftentimes
        fun stuff comes out of that. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>This, this is veering again, and I apologize. That's what we do here. I think if it applies, the mini mode was not programmable. The prophet five, Dave Smith's sequential circuits, profit five was the first fully programmable
      polyphonic synthesizer. And that led to many other programmable synthesizers, like the DX seven, where you could have all these sounds in the instrument and push a button and almost immediately have a new sound. Well, over the last few years,
      I've found it very cool that a number of manufacturers have gone back to making non programmable synthesizers. Right? And I had a conversation about this with, with some people, and there are a number of benefits to something that's non
      programmable. For one thing, it forces you to work with the controls that you do have, so that the sound you make doesn't get stale, that it there's movement, any kind of sound and music that, that is so repetitive and never changes that that
      tends to ruin music.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>At least for me, is things need to change a part needs to get a little bit louder than these, to have tangible changes. It needs to move in in interesting ways. And so with a non programmable synthesizer, you have to work with what
      the filter is doing or what the oscillator Tambor is doing. And it forces you to learn the instrument that someone with a programmable instrument may never get beyond just merely selecting new presets going from preset to preset. So, another
      thing, in fact, it was, it was Dave Smith. I keep bringing his name up and he's a worthy guy.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Are you talking about the history of the, of the, you know, the history of the electronic music world? I mean, he seemed to have his fingers in all of that. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>Yes. Well, his take on it was that a lot of purported professional sense assists do not actually understand the flow of electronic signals that create the sound that synthesizers do. They don't understand how to route things, which
      you learn to do if you work with a non programmable, instrument synthesizer and even more. So if you have either a modular synthesizer or an instrument that requires you to use past chords in order to create sound and, and control things. So
      there's a great benefit to having these instruments because you learn so much more about how synthesis works,
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Right. And I mean, there's, there's also a kind of a side benefit. If a manufacturer says that they're going to, make a non programmable synthesizer, it also almost requires that there's like no menu system, no increment and
        decrement buttons, you know, all of this, there, there really needs to be a rich control surface in order for that to even make sense. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>Yes. I, I assembled a panel at the Nam show in January and Dave Smith was on the panel, as was Jerry Bassman, who Jerry has, has a reputation for the demonstrations that he used to do at Namsos, specifically for, for EMU systems.
      He, yes, Timo monster, he put on all these great shows. And so he now works for propeller head software. Propeller head makes the program reason, which I won't go into that right now. But anyway, Jerry was on this panel and he was talking about
      another benefit of a non programmable instrument. Is that for a performance, he would set the instrument up and just focus on a handful of controllers that he would use to make changes during a song or during a performance. So that the
      instrument didn't, the sound did not change significantly, but more subtly, but yet it was very effective for the music that he was playing.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Right. Well, it sort of makes sense because if you think about it from an acoustic instrument standpoint, you know, a saxophone is doesn't pick up an Alto sax and expect it to sound like a saxophone for this song and a lead
        guitar for the next song, in a symphony for the song after that, right. That nobody would expect an Alto sax to pull that off. And, so there's, I, one of the things I tend to sort of harp on and on and on about is virtuosity with an
        instrument. And I think sometimes these highly programmable instruments, give you variety and an interesting pallet of available sounds, but don't necessarily draw you into any sort of virtuosity with it as an instrument. It ends up sort of
        like a novelty toy for <span style="color:red" data-ts="2324.11" data-end_ts="2324.44" title="2324.11" id=c_"2324.11">__space__</span>, for a sound rather than an instrument that you learn in depth. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>Very true, very true. I am the first to admit that I'm not a very good keyboard player. I do take advantage of, capabilities that many synthesizers give you like sequencers and arpeggiator that you can hold a chord and it can play
      this fancy string of notes that I couldn't play myself. But, your eyes really open as do your ears. When you do hear the people who do become virtuosos with their instruments, it does make a big difference. And
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Given your experience, and especially working with keyboard where you got to meet an incredible number of people would one, one of the things I would say is that there is actually, you can be a virtual. So with a synthesizer
        without necessarily being a virtual keyboard player, that the, you know, when you, when you look at what fantastic sound designers can do, I mean, I was always in awe of like Eric precincts, a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2406.57"
          data-end_ts="2406.93" title="2406.57" id=c_"2406.57">__solid__</span> design work. I mean, the guy made every, he, he made synthesizer speak in such a wonderful way. And I always felt like, you know, I wouldn't care if he could only play
        chopsticks, I would still classify him as a virtual. So because he really, he studied any mastered, sound design in such a wonderful way. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>Yes. Eric was also on my panel. Just give him a shout out because Eric was responsible. Well, he, he didn't do it all himself, but, one of the best selling synthesizers of all time was the Roland <span style="color:red"
        data-ts="2451.33" data-end_ts="2452.2" title="2451.33" id=c_"2451.33">__***<inaudible>***__</span> and Eric played a huge part in voicing that instrument, sound design, as, as you're saying, Darwin, creating, creating these sounds. And during
      the process of voicing the D 51 of the Japanese engineers, as a, as a little joke put code into the little microprocessor that would scan through different wave forms, different <span style="color:red" data-ts="2484.63" data-end_ts="2485.35"
        title="2484.63" id=c_"2484.63">__cameras__</span>, as you were playing a sound right. And that became, he, he did it as a joke, but when Eric heard this, he convinced the guy, no, you have to leave this in. This is, this is a great
      capability. And there was a patch and in the Roland D 50 called digital native dance that all anybody had to demonstrate in the music store was to call up that patch and just hit a low note. And people's jaws would just drop on the floor
      because here's this instrument making this unique pattern of, of tambours that just, astounded people. And, and Eric said they sold, I don't know. I know they sold over a hundred thousand of, of the Roland D 50, like 160,000, which is huge in
      the synthesizer market. And, and that played a great part in it. Eric also has a company called Spectrasonics, which is one of the most respected makers of software synthesizers these days. So yes,
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>The good work </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>He does, he's a fantastic musician and a fantastic person to yeah.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Give it, given that you have experienced some, a lot of things that most people will never experience it only in the synthesizer book, you talk about having had the opportunity to see, some of these super rare instruments
        either because you happened to, I think, was it the ADSL synth that you saw at a vintage computers show or something </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>Con Brio yeah, yeah, yeah. The, the ads, Tim Ryan, and, and two other guys made this instrument. There's, there's so much history to it, but this thing, these Con, they were college kids and they assembled this instrument that
      could do today. What many dog digital audio workstations could not do? And the, it used these hand wired circuit boards. And I, I believe what were the old floppy disks when the, when the disks were really floppy?
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>No, it was eight inch. Yeah. The big eight inch desks. Yeah. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>Yeah. And that instrument, number one, it could load things from desk, faster than Macintoshes could before we got to solid state drives. And there were all these controls on the front panel of the Con Breo, and it looks very
      complicated and it had, I don't know, like five or six different modes, but when you went into a certain mode, only the controls that work for that particular mode would be lit up. The others would go dark and those, ideas on their own are
      incredible enough. But the sound of this instrument is just phenomenal, even today. So yeah, Tim Ryan and the other guys, Tim Ryan started to company M audio, which before that was called <span style="color:red" data-ts="2713.32"
        data-end_ts="2713.59" title="2713.32" id=c_"2713.32">__mini__</span> man.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>And </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>They showed the Con Breo to Mr. Kakehashi Pitaro Kakehashi of the founder of Roland. Mr. K is he's affectionately known, recommended that they take many of the ideas that were in the Con view, instrument and care pair them down to
      make individual devices, which is what <span style="color:red" data-ts="2743.71" data-end_ts="2743.95" title="2743.71" id=c_"2743.71">__meeting__</span> man and M audio have been good at. But that instrument on its own was, was it, I think
      there's one working model. And some of the sounds from that appeared in a star Trek, the motion picture, some, some of that audio is in that movie, it was generated by the Con Breo.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Well, and it's kind of interesting to think, because, you know, realistically with the modern movement towards controllers, as an important part of everyone's studio, M audio was really kind of at the forefront of
        that. And to think that all of that might've come out of a discussion Mr. K had with the Con <span style="color:red" data-ts="2791.1" data-end_ts="2791.43" title="2791.1" id=c_"2791.1">__real__</span> folks is, is really a fascinating and
        completely unknown piece of history. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>Yes. And you were talking earlier about being a guitar player, and we're talking now about controllers. The guitar is one of the few instruments that does not translate well into <span style="color:red" data-ts="2812.43"
        data-end_ts="2813.06" title="2812.43" id=c_"2812.43">__middy__</span>. I'm sure you've tried numerous.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>There's a trail of tears behind that man. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>There, there have been, you were talking about saxophone. There have been very successful wind instruments. Nile Steiner, made an electronic valve instrument and an electronic wind instrument, Yamaha made <span style="color:red"
        data-ts="2840.66" data-end_ts="2841.11" title="2840.66" id=c_"2840.66">__may__</span> and, Chi, well, actually it was based on mouse <span style="color:red" data-ts="2844.89" data-end_ts="2845.27" title="2844.89"
        id=c_"2844.89">__diners__</span> stuff. Those have been successful. There've been drums, translated into electronic controllers, but guitar and also voice do not translate well. I, when I was a Keyboard Magazine, one month, I reviewed a
      couple of pitch to MITIE converters, that had microphones that you would sing into and they would confer that intimidate data, right? And, and one of them allowed you to plug in the microphone to amplify your voice. And I have to tell you
      Darwin that the, the way you need to sing to get <span style="color:red" data-ts="2893.84" data-end_ts="2894.14" title="2893.84" id=c_"2893.84">__tack__</span> accurate tracking for <span style="color:red" data-ts="2895.58"
        data-end_ts="2896.12" title="2895.58" id=c_"2895.58">__middy__</span> data is not something that your ears want to hear because you have to sing at perfect.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>No five, Brado just a perfect pitch. And, you know, vibrato will make it go all over the place. And you don't want to hear that. A couple of months after that review appeared in Keyboard Magazine, I was contacted by a guy who
      claimed that he had created, a pitch to media converter that could identify individual notes and accord. This was 1989. I don't even know if they had that kind of technology at Stanford. But he made this claim and I said, well, that's, that's
      very interesting. I I'd love to check that out. So this box arrived and I got this device out. It was a little tabletop unit and it came with a plastic microphone. And so I plugged it into a mini synthesizer and plugged in the microphone and
      started to sing. And what I discovered was the guy had made a fabulous stochastic note generator because it didn't matter what pitch I sang into the microphone. All of these notes would come in. So I just put the thing back in a box and wrote
      the guy, a letter saying, you know, well, nice try, but you do not want us to write about this in <span style="color:red" data-ts="2988.47" data-end_ts="2988.56" title="2988.47" id=c_"2988.47">__life__</span>.

    <p>
      <b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_02: </b>Great. He made the magic melody maker. It's just, that's what he, wasn't what he was shooting for. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2996.01" data-end_ts="2996.1" title="2996.01" id=c_"2996.01">__Okay__</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>No, I don't think so. I should have sent it to Stanford. They might've been able to do something.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_02: </b>Yeah, maybe. So, so like, in your, in your estimation, when people talk about sort of the, the Mount Rushmore of electronic music, you know, we have Dr. Mall, we have, you know, we would talk about Don Buccolam, you
      know, I would, I would suggest that there are other people that right now are maybe sort of an undervalued. Who's the guy behind, new England digital, the, the whole Synclavier system. I can't remember his name right now, but, you know, the
      Synclavier really changed people's, understanding and imagination of what electronic music could do, John Appleton. Yeah. That's it. And, and then certainly the people who were, involved in the early, the creation of the early, computer-based
      sequencers, and especially when sequencers also included digital audio. So for me, that digital audio inclusion was wet. What allowed me to go back to analog because I could still do this constructed recording, but I could, I could
      bring it in, you know, I could record the audio digitally and then build up other stuff around it. So that was my transition tool. And then of course, now at this point I don't actually have a, I don't have a synthesizer that
      speaks <span style="color:red" data-ts="3094.31" data-end_ts="3094.64" title="3094.31" id=c_"3094.31">__Mitty__</span>. I have all analog only systems. So it's just, how are the kids? Is that right? But anyway, who are some other people that
      you think, you know, may have been overlooked in the discussion about, you know, like hall of fame status,
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>I'm going to mention, several people. One was a guy named bill <span style="color:red" data-ts="3124.27" data-end_ts="3125.08" title="3124.27" id=c_"3124.27">__***<inaudible>***__</span>. He used to work for in Sonic and he bill
      Motley designed some well, they weren't really modifications, but they were software configurations for in Sonic products, like, they're samplers, they're EPS 16 plus and ASR, 10 samplers, and bill recreated, something called the voter, not the
      vocoder, but the voter, voice operation demonstrator that was being developed or was developed by a bell labs back in the thirties. And the, the original hardware voter was a device that operators learned how to use their hands, their fingers
      and their feet. And they could make the thing talk and not only talk, but expressively talk,
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>Articulate words with, with emotion. There's a YouTube, on YouTube there's if you look for voter V O D E R, there are some, from the 1939 new York's world's fair. I think, I think this one was on there where a guy's telling this,
      this operator lady to make the thing talk and she makes the thing talk. Well, bill Motley, had his company was wave <span style="color:red" data-ts="3223.2" data-end_ts="3223.5" title="3223.2" id=c_"3223.2">__way__</span> boy industries, and
      you can still find the software. You can still find these in Sonic samplers, not the Mirage, not the original EPS, 16 EPS, but the 16 plus, and the SRS, it's almost worth getting this software. I think, who's the crazy chicken guy down in
      chicken systems. He still sells this way boy vote, or that you can load samples into the thing. And then the lower, like octave and a half of the keyboard change the filter to, to, to give like articulation, like vowel sounds and consonant
      pluses and things like that, that you can, it will take a lot of practice, but you can, if you have have a sample in there, you can kind of try to make it sound like speaking.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>So there's, there's one guy for you. Another one is a guy I named <span style="color:red" data-ts="3289.49" data-end_ts="3290.06" title="3289.49" id=c_"3289.49">__Armand__</span> peseta. Armand actually developed one of the first
      keyboards that was capable of polyphony of playing more than one note at a time with, with <span style="color:red" data-ts="3303.5" data-end_ts="3304.1" title="3303.5" id=c_"3303.5">__synthesize__</span>. He developed his keyboard about the
      same time that the, EMU guys created their system that went into the prophet five and that Tom Oberheim used for his polyphonic synthesizers, but Armand used like, military surplus parts and created these polyphonic keyboards that responded
      more quickly than the other polyphonic keyboards. Two people that I know have used our mom's keyboard. One was Don Lewis, Don Lewis. So lived in the Bay area for a long time. He was in an LA before then, but, Don Lewis was familiar with Armand
      pesetas work and he used one, at least one of our mom's keyboards on some albums.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>He demonstrated a recorded for Quincy Jones and some other, other big people. It's also in the, Tonto synthesizers, big, huge monster synthesizer that Malcolm Cecil put together, and, and Stevie wonder used on some of his albums.
      So, Armand, peseta, he still out there he's, still trying to develop and, and make these things for sale. But he just doesn't, he, he's not interested in selling his ideas to a corporation or anything like that. He wants to do it himself. And,
      you know, there's so much power in as far as synthesizers and everything are concerned in computers, but kind of the obstruction now are the controllers to do it expressively and with as much capabilities as you'd like to have. I mentioned
      earlier M audio novation is another company that's made, keyboard controllers. I think, I think the difficulty, one of the difficulties is that you have so many parameters on synthesizers, especially in a computer that you have all these banks
      of knobs or whatever.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>And depending on the patch that you're playing, what the knobs do may change, you know, a knob for one, one patch might control the filter cutoff and for another patch that might control the attack time on the filter envelope. So,
      so that's, I dunno, I, I, I think that, manufacturers are still struggling to address that capability. I, I love, some of the synthesizers, the soft sense that you can get for your Macintosh or iOS, things like the iPad and the iPod touch, but
      I still prefer hardware. I still prefer things with dedicated knobs that, you know, this knob does the filter resonance, and isn't going to change it. But it is a great time to be a synthesis because everyone has so many different choices. You
      can, you can go modular, you can build your own,
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_02: </b>Right. And, and the, the fact is that, even the combination of soft sense hardware <span style="color:red" data-ts="3544.77" data-end_ts="3545.37" title="3544.77" id=c_"3544.77">__pre-built__</span> since modulars,
      the many ways you can build hybrid systems is, is pretty spectacular and really allows you to individualize your, your studio to kind of work the way you, your brain, which is I think pretty fantastic. Yeah.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>Yes. And the brick wall I'm running into now is the fact that I have too many choices.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_02: </b>Well, yeah. I wanted to ask you about this because, if I'm not mistaken, I, you actually shared a photo of me with me of, your modular system, which is
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>Very small, very small. I have, I have a single panel of surge and then a single, well, actually a little bit more than a single panel of Euro rack stuff <span style="color:red" data-ts="3598.09" data-end_ts="3598.3"
        title="3598.09" id=c_"3598.09">__has__</span> a little bit of deffer. I have some make noise. I have a fantastic sequencer that, George Mattson and his brother, Scott.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_02: </b>Yeah, the guy he does does that, the guy who does division six,
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>Division six. Yeah. Scott, Scott rise, I believe. I have a plague <span style="color:red" data-ts="3625.36" data-end_ts="3625.66" title="3625.36" id=c_"3625.36">__bear__</span> filter. I have a Pittsburgh VCO, very small there's so
      much here that, well, I also have a depth for matrix mixer that I got, because I had been reading about David tutor and listening to some of his music and David tutor enjoyed making things feedback right. In a different way than Jimmy <span
        style="color:red" data-ts="3651.85" data-end_ts="3652.36" title="3651.85" id=c_"3651.85">__Hendricks__</span>. But, so, you know, I I'm keeping this small, I have too many other instruments. Tell ya a good friend of mine, drew Newman. There's
      a lot of drew in the books.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_02: </b>Yeah. I noticed that. And I mean, if I, every time that drew Newman a picture of his studio would show up, I was like, I was like, damn you Mark Vale,
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_02: </b>Because I have worked so hard. I mean, one of the things I like about your system is that it, it seems like this very personalized musical weapon. I hate to say it that way, but the reason I think of it that way is
      because of these stories you read like of the, you know, the turn from the 18th or 19th to 20th century, where people, a lot of times they would really customize their pistols, right. To make it exactly fit their hand and the coloring would fit
      their wardrobe, you know, and it would have like their personality written all over their gun. Right. Well, now it's socially unacceptable to have a personalized gun. So we've all moved to synthesizers,
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>Not enough of us,
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_02: </b>Maybe you're right. But nevertheless, you know, it really reminded me of that, of I saw your personality displayed in that. And you know, I have, I've got a little, I have like a tip top station, two 52 things. So
      it's like three little ranks and I've been obsessive about, Ooh, this one doesn't really fit my personality. This one, the light is too bright. And so I'll never use it, so I can't have it then, you know, and it becomes that kind of, that kind
      of momentum of me, you know, established in a sense. And so it's funny, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3772.08" data-end_ts="3772.31" title="3772.08" id=c_"3772.08">__I've__</span> I feel like, you know, like your system and my system, and a
      lot of people's systems are moving into that. It's, it's gone away from being these enormous systems into being these little personalized systems. And I just, when I think, yep, that's perfection, then you show me these pictures of <span
        style="color:red" data-ts="3791.49" data-end_ts="3793.08" title="3791.49" id=c_"3791.49">__***<inaudible>***__</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>Well, the whole point about showing those, those pictures of drew Newman's incredible collection of synthesizers and other instruments is that he is so productive with what he has. If I had that many choices, I'd get brain lock,
      but drew did the music, for Aeon flux. And he's done music for many, animation movies. And I was fascinated because not only does he have modular synthesizers, he has multiple formats. He has the five view, which is what started with mode
      modular. He has Serge can, yeah. Mon can a, he has zero rack and it just fascinates me how productive he is, even with having all of those things. So I'm sorry.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_02: </b>One of the things at one point I had really quite a room full of stuff. I had a lot of stuff. And from, for me, the frustration of that was because a lot of it was older equipment. It meant that at any given time, 20%
      of it was broken and I really didn't have the electronic chops to fix it myself, nor did I have the free cash to have someone fix it for me. So there was this, built-in disappointment of having all this equipment
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>And, and then there's the problem of, of deciding, you know, maybe I don't need that anymore. It still works, but maybe I don't need it anymore. So I'll sell, sell it on eBay. And then two weeks later you just regret it.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_02: </b>Yeah. And especially with some of some of this stuff, if you sell it, you may never be able to buy it.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="3915.5" data-end_ts="3916.04" title="3915.5" id=c_"3915.5">__***<inaudible>***__</span> someone is very rare.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_02: </b>So my question to you and we've, I have used up so much of your time already. I apologize for that.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>Oh, I love this. This could go all night. Tell me about it.
    </p>

    -----

    <p>
      <b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_02: </b>But I have one question that is been, you know, I literally have, we don't want it to ask <span style="color:red" data-ts="3934.2" data-end_ts="3934.29" title="3934.2" id=c_"3934.2">__us__</span> to use since second
      one of this discussion, which is surely there is a Holy grail synth for you. You have gotten to see touch and interact with so many things over the years. Is there something that for you is a Holy grail that you don't think you can get?
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>I I'd have to go back to that. Con Breo really. Because, the ideas that they came up with that just floor me was the first one was the S 100 and they took it apart and made a few ads to hundreds. You know, I've, I've played
      instruments that I just absolutely love the mini <span style="color:red" data-ts="3984.33" data-end_ts="3984.51" title="3984.33" id=c_"3984.33">__Mo__</span> guy love, although I did have to sell it to buy my little surge. When I saw the first
      ad for the Nord lead, from this, Swedish company, clavia I thought, Oh, look, that that's funny, it's red, or that it looks plastic. What a joke, and then
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_02: </b>Would a knob or a wooden stick on it?
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>Yeah. I looked at that and I said, well, how silly is that? Well, it came to me at keyboard for review and I got it out of the box. And I immediately fell in love with the thing, because it was like a polyphonic mini mode. And I
      still have it it's pictured on the back cover of the synthesizer book. I still love playing that instrument. It's, it's a digital sound production, but it does sound very analog. There are limitations, like a lot of people love to plug external
      audio into synthesizer and <span style="color:red" data-ts="4056.09" data-end_ts="4056.48" title="4056.09" id=c_"4056.09">__process__</span> process at, with the synthesizers filters and the other components. But the Nord lead never has had an
      audio input and the original hardly didn't have any effects, no delay or no reverb or anything like that. So you do have to process it with external devices. So it isn't as convenient as I would like, but I still love my little Nord lead.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>It's one of the things that I'm, I'm still on the fence. I still, you know, I, I've got to take this rack of modular stuff to the avid reader for the book signing. I have this pedal board with a bunch of different things on it and
      you know, it's a small town, there's not much parking the store, doesn't have their own parking space. And David's going to bring his stuff and ride with me. I asked his son <span style="color:red" data-ts="4115.42" data-end_ts="4115.84"
        title="4115.42" id=c_"4115.42">__Toma__</span> to take pictures and video of the book signing and the performance. So I I'm having, I'm having a difficult time at this Darwin, but, I'm trying really hard to limit what I take, but there's so
      much I could take. But then the Nord Nord lead and, and, and another instrument is the Nord modular, which I have the original version of that.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>The Nord modular is a fantastic concept and that you have a hardware piece that connects to a computer. And on the computer, you have modules, you have virtual modules, like you would get with a modular synthesizer and you, you can
      plug, you can put those on, on your computer screen and you connect the cables and everything. And then you send that across the middy line, into the hardware unit. And once it's in the hardware unit, you can unplug the computer and you can
      just take the Nord modular with you. It's not a, it's not a, the keyboard doesn't have after touch it. The original doesn't even have the pitch stick or the little mod wheel, which infuriated me when they introduced it. But it has like a dozen
      knobs on it. And that gets back to the other thing, where was one patch and <span style="color:red" data-ts="4198.04" data-end_ts="4198.28" title="4198.04" id=c_"4198.04">__knob__</span> white, maybe do my do one thing. And then another Patsy
      would do something completely different. So maybe it's the, the Arturia origin. That's kind of like the Nord modular in that you have modules, but what are, did, <span style="color:red" data-ts="4220.15" data-end_ts="4220.63" title="4220.15"
        id=c_"4220.15">__Arturia__</span> makes all these great soft fence that are based on vintage instruments, but they have with the origin, you can have a Yamaha Felter and cannot combine that with a mode oscillator. And
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_02: </b>Oh, they do cross, they, they cross those boundaries in the origin. I didn't realize that. Oh, that's interesting.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>Yes. So, yeah, the perfect synthesizer.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_02: </b>Yeah. Well, I'll tell you what mine is and you actually have a great big picture of it in your book, which is that, enormous Waldorf wave. Oh yeah. I have always lusted over that. And even because I can articulate why
      I lost over it, other than it looks like it, it looks like what I would've considered the coolest looking instrument when I was 12. Right. And I have to admit, I probably still feel like that's the coolest, lucky.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>Now there's been a synthesize, showed up at Nam the last few years, and I'm sure it's at the Frankfort music messa. I have never played it. I have just, I, I can't touch it because if I touch it, It's, it's an, polyphonic analog
      synthesizer. I don't know if it's programmable, but it's about the size of the Waldorf wave. And it has this incredible, front panel covered with knobs, like a big old <span style="color:red" data-ts="4323.05" data-end_ts="4323.47"
        title="4323.05" id=c_"4323.05">__Mo__</span> and, I can't say the name of it now.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_02: </b>Yeah. I <span style="color:red" data-ts="4328.24" data-end_ts="4328.48" title="4328.24" id=c_"4328.24">__try__</span> to remember it as well. The poor guy, it would just hit us both on the head too, because he's so
      much wants everybody to just fall in love with it. Yes. But it's not only is it as big as a Buick? I think it costs about as much as a Buick too. So
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>Yes, definitely. Definitely. So we, we have to, we have to make, do with what we can.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_02: </b>Yeah. Clearly. Well, it's interesting that, that you have such a love for the North nor, nor lead. I had one of the <span style="color:red" data-ts="4361.99" data-end_ts="4362.23" title="4361.99"
        id=c_"4361.99">__Nord__</span> lead ones and that was one of the things when the northerly two came out, I'm like, Ooh, it's better. And I sold my <span style="color:red" data-ts="4370.21" data-end_ts="4370.45" title="4370.21"
        id=c_"4370.21">__North__</span> lead one to get the two. And I was like, Hmm, doesn't quite feel right. And then an orderly three chemo. I'm like, I'm going with this because three is better than two. And then it was like, Oh, this really
      isn't working for me. I want to Nord lead one. I can't find one. I can't find one anywhere
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>Now. Here's what I understand. Clavia and Propellerhead software are both in, Stockholm, Sweden. I believe that the guy who designed the sound engine for the original Nord lead and the first version of the Nord modular, I believe
      he went to Propellerhead. So they lost the guy who was responsible for, for the tones of those instruments at clavia.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_02: </b>Yeah. And it was, I mean, the tone was definitely different, but also even, I mean, it was silly stuff. Like the way that, that wouldn't pitch stick felt like the tension on it changed. And I'm like, you're screwed
      with my thing, man.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>And there's another difference is it's purely cosmetic. The original Nord lead has beveled corners <span style="color:red" data-ts="4456.93" data-end_ts="4457.14" title="4456.93" id=c_"4456.93">__because__</span> the upper right.
      And the lower left and, and I'm sure that costs more than,
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_02: </b>Yeah. I was going to say, you know, that somebody said we can save $50 in manufacturing if we don't make those beveled corners.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>Yeah. Now, I, like I mentioned earlier, the court and chaos off later run, then the first chaos pad is, a processor that I loved play the Nord lead through. And I there's that space to the right of the control panel on the North
      lead where you can put something right. But that dog on beveled edge chaos had sit there nicely, you know, it wants to go over the edge.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_02: </b>Right. Although, you know, what I realized now is that that's the perfect surface for like one of those <span style="color:red" data-ts="4507.14" data-end_ts="4507.59" title="4507.14" id=c_"4507.14">__corn__</span>.
      Phocas something like that that would actually kind of fit in there nicely. Although it does mean an effects processor <span style="color:red" data-ts="4514.31" data-end_ts="4514.49" title="4514.31" id=c_"4514.31">__when__</span> anyway. All
      right. So Mark, thank you so much for your time listeners, please go out and check out, Mark's news book, the synthesizer it's mind numbing in his depth. I mean, and one of the things that's really interesting is he takes a very unique approach
      to how he groups, the history of things. It's, it's a fascinating read, no matter how much you think you know about synthesizers and synth history, you're going to learn tons of new stuff. So get out there, those of you who have an opportunity
      head out to the avid reader, on April 11th, that's in Davis, California. I, I may try and weasel away out there, my own self I'm sure I can make a, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="4559.58" data-end_ts="4559.76" title="4559.58"
        id=c_"4559.58">__can__</span>, I'm sure I can make a call on there having to be a meeting somewhere in that vicinity with somebody I'll have to, you've given me enough time to generate Mead.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_02: </b>Right. So, thank you so much for your time. It was fantastic talking to you,
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>Darwin. I so enjoyed it and I hope we can do it again sometime.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_02: </b>I'm sure we'll do it. I have about a million more questions they ask you too. So, thank you very much and have a great evening. Thank you, Darwin.
