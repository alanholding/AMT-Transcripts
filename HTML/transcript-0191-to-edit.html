<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today I am going to get a chance to talk to somebody who I've been working with a bit lately. His name is <span style="color:red" data-ts="18.445" data-end_ts="19.285" title="18.445" id=c_"18.445">__Sean Franco__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="19.335" data-end_ts="19.685" title="19.335" id=c_"19.335">__Chico__</span>, and he is the mastermind behind the Mod Devices Pedal Set. This is something that came outta my radar when I was at the <span style="color:red" data-ts="28.545" data-end_ts="28.765" title="28.545" id=c_"28.545">__NAM__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="28.765" data-end_ts="28.925" title="28.765" id=c_"28.765">__show__</span> last year. The guy that was working, working the run with me, Tom Hall, was like, oh, you have to check out what John Franco's doing. So we went down in <span style="color:red" data-ts="37.275" data-end_ts="37.565" title="37.275" id=c_"37.275">__Hall__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="37.965" data-end_ts="38.085" title="37.965" id=c_"37.965">__E__</span> and I was introduced to this really cool little pedal and this amazing infrastructure to run on the pedal. It's basically a browser-based pedal arranger. That's outrageous. But then as we started talking, it became even more interesting because it's a pedal that you can actually write your own code for. Since I'm a kind of a code head, I really enjoy the, the sound of that. And so, I've been working with him ever since. And, recently we did a thing where, maxims P'S Gen Code now can run on the Mod device's pedal. It's pretty fantastic. And I've been building my own little top secret rig here for my own use. It's a lot of fun. But anyway, enough of my talking. Let's talk to Jean Franco. Hey, John Franco. How are you doing? Hello, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco Ceccolini (Mod Devices): </b>Darvin. Very, it's a big pleasure to be here and, thanks a lot for the invitation. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, thanks a lot for letting me rattle on a bit. But I, from the second I saw what you were doing, I was very excited by it, and I remain excited by it because it kind of, it delivers what you, what you promise, which is kind of cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>Well, the, the do, it's a lot of fun. We are very impressive with the feedback that we are getting from the new, from the users. It's, it's really seems to be paying off all the effort that we put in order to build the, the infrastructure itself. As I said, it's a complete ecosystem, right? It's coming out very nicely now that the, the community's growing and the dual relies a lot on community effect. So it's, it's now starting to get lots of traction. It's really good 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right now for people who maybe aren't familiar with it, the, the version of the pedal that you have right now is called The Duo. Why is it called a duo? Just 'cause it has like two screens or, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>Yeah, sort of, when we, I started this quite some time ago. Darwin, actually, I started working on this on 2010. There's <span style="color:red" data-ts="149.845" data-end_ts="149.965" title="149.845" id=c_"149.845">__a__</span> quite a journey since then. I'm from Brazil, and we started this in Brazil. And the, we had a product, that we released it only in the Brazilian market in 2013, which was called it the Mod Quadra. It had, four controllers, and, we thought it was a nice name, like, and then when we were thinking about going for smaller products, and, this was the biggest, feedback we got with the Quadra, that it was too big. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And then we were thinking <span style="color:red" data-ts="177.325" data-end_ts="177.445" title="177.325" id=c_"177.325">__on__</span>, okay, how to name the guys. And I don't like, code names. I like, like, proper names like persons. Sure. And Duo <span style="color:red" data-ts="184.955" data-end_ts="185.245" title="184.955" id=c_"184.955">__seem__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="185.395" data-end_ts="185.685" title="185.395" id=c_"185.395">__seem__</span> to be a, a nice one because it has, yes, it's, it's two, two inputs, two outputs, but at the same time, two controllers. You can use it with two different instruments, so it can use it as a duo, you know, like a musical duo. Lots of wordplay with that. Right. So I don't have one particular reason for the name, but, yeah. The Duo word sticks to the device in lots of different ways. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. It really does. I am a little bit curious about your, about how you got the, got this thing started. So the, the Duo actually is the result of a Kickstarter, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>Yes. We, we were in Brazil. Well, let me rewind, this a bit to the start. Okay. Okay. I, I played guitar since I am a early teenager. I think since 1989. I got my first guitar. And on the same year I got my first computer, also a pc, <span style="color:red" data-ts="236.205" data-end_ts="237.885" title="236.205" id=c_"236.205">__82, 86__</span>, something like that. Okay. Didn't run even Windows. Right. And, I've been tinkering with the computers and with the guitars since then. Since then. And, I've always been into computers as the same way I've been into guitars, but I never managed it to have a proper connection between the guitar and the computer. I, I actually never link <span style="color:red" data-ts="257.725" data-end_ts="257.885" title="257.725" id=c_"257.725">__in__</span> that, them properly on a sense that for me, computers were things to do work or programming and et cetera. And the guitar is that other environment that I go, I plug my pedals and just rock on. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>Like, no, no technology involved. Just music. <span style="color:red" data-ts="273.835" data-end_ts="274.125" title="273.835" id=c_"273.835">__Yeah__</span>. And, as soon as I started using, I bought my first digital multi effects. I, I used it to use pedals before. And at one point I went to the <span style="color:red" data-ts="284.125" data-end_ts="284.285" title="284.125" id=c_"284.125">__multi__</span> effects because the, the pedals, they have all the problem of weight and, <span style="color:red" data-ts="288.945" data-end_ts="289.165" title="288.945" id=c_"288.945">__it__</span>, it scales very fast as you add more pedals and the power supply for each of them, lots <span style="color:red" data-ts="294.485" data-end_ts="294.605" title="294.485" id=c_"294.485">__of__</span>, I find the pedals, although I like them a lot, I find them a bit cumbersome when you're going actually on the road with the band and, trying to do gigs in spa in places. And then I went there, I bought my first digital <span style="color:red" data-ts="308.495" data-end_ts="308.845" title="308.495" id=c_"308.495">__multi__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="308.925" data-end_ts="309.245" title="308.925" id=c_"308.925">__effects__</span>. It was a <span style="color:red" data-ts="310.045" data-end_ts="310.325" title="310.045" id=c_"310.045">__card__</span>, a five. First thing I realized is that, those are closed packages on the sense that for the A five, for example, it had great modulation, delays, reverbs, but the dis, the distortions, they were awful, really awful. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>And I said, okay, so I have this package here, this box that kind of should deliver all the sounds that I need, but some of them are totally unusable, so I still keep the needing to have the, the pedals. And that was very annoying. And, I move it to another <span style="color:red" data-ts="344.715" data-end_ts="345.035" title="344.715" id=c_"344.715">__multi__</span> effect, <span style="color:red" data-ts="346.135" data-end_ts="346.355" title="346.135" id=c_"346.135">__cog__</span>, again, the G three, which, was supposed to have a very good distortion, and it had, but it was too simple and it was very limited on the way that you program it. So then I had another problem, which is, okay, this is a kind of a super <span style="color:red" data-ts="360.285" data-end_ts="360.605" title="360.285" id=c_"360.285">__pedal__</span>, but still not, I, and I never got to the point, darling never got to the point that I <span style="color:red" data-ts="365.605" data-end_ts="365.725" title="365.605" id=c_"365.605">__said__</span>, okay, now I'm satisfied. And the conclusion that I got is, is that these, these multi effects, they were digital only on the backbone, but on the way to market it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>And on the, like the business model, let's say, it's still analog on the sense that you still have to buy a box and you're stuck with what you got. If you want more things, you have to buy new ones. And being a computer savvy person, I said, okay, why can't I reprogram this? Like, why is it not possible? And the idea of doing the, the mod thing came from this, from this question. Like, why can't I have a processor for my music that I can reprogram it? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, when I was doing this, the PCs, when the, the idea came out first was in, I think 2002, 2003, something like that. I was discussing with, with some friends because there was a bit of, processing being done on the computer, but no realtime processing. I had <span style="color:red" data-ts="421.885" data-end_ts="422.045" title="421.885" id=c_"421.885">__to__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="422.045" data-end_ts="422.245" title="422.045" id=c_"422.045">__paint__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="422.245" data-end_ts="422.445" title="422.245" id=c_"422.245">__tune__</span> two, two megahertz. At that time, it was not capable of doing proper realtime audio at all. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>DST had had come out like, for a short time. And it was only for post-production. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. We thought about this, oh, it would be awesome if we could do this on a pc, but at the same time, the PC doesn't have the Ergon <span style="color:red" data-ts="440.365" data-end_ts="440.565" title="440.365" id=c_"440.365">__me__</span> that's necessary for a musician. It's not, you know, keyboard and mouse. They dont mix with the stage, all these things. And then I ended up buying a development kit from Analog Devices. This was in 2008. This was the first time we decided, okay, let's, let's see if we can build this stuff. I bought this kit. It was a shark, DSP from analog devices. We tried lots of stuff. Only in 2010 is when we, we actually got some money from the Brazilian government, like a grant to put in a project. And this really kicked off the idea. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>And, at this year, we, we were still with the DS P, but we changed it from the shark to the Blackfin, which was a, another family of DSPs. Okay. And by the mid of 2000 <span style="color:red" data-ts="489.425" data-end_ts="489.645" title="489.425" id=c_"489.425">__or__</span> 2010, we had kind of a prototype, our very first prototype. And we saw that we had to port everything, all the code, everything needed to be ported. And I said, okay, this, this, like, the idea, it's, it's great, but, this won't work on the sense that I don't have the manpower to, to do all of this, to rewrite everything ever, me Exactly right. Yeah. No. And in the end, I said, let's, let's imagine that I would have that manpower. Then I had the second problem, which is, okay, now I'm competing toe <span style="color:red" data-ts="519.765" data-end_ts="519.845" title="519.765" id=c_"519.765">__to__</span> toe with Roland and with the Line six, because they are providing algorithms, and I will need to be an algorithm provider as well, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>So that, that became, okay, this is a blocker, in parallel with this. But, I've been since the, the, the start of Linux in Brazil. I've been <span style="color:red" data-ts="537.525" data-end_ts="537.645" title="537.525" id=c_"537.525">__a__</span> kind of a Linux enthusiast, not a heavy user. And at one point in my, with my, like, personal computers, I went back to desktops. I started using notebooks for a long time, switched to Mac. I stopped using Windows. And when I, I moved it from Sao Paulo to Rio, I said, okay, let me buy a desktop for me again. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and I decided to go for a Linux box. Ubuntu had, gone, had been released like one or, two years, before that. And it was already kind of, of the big thing in Linux at the time, 2007, I believe. Okay. I was astonished. I was really astonished. There was this kind of a cousin from Ubuntu was called it Ubuntu Studio. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>Yes. And you could, install it on your machine was really easy. And you had complete, os for multimedia production. I mean, there was the Jack Audio server to route the, the audio internally. And there was the, the plugins from Lads <span style="color:red" data-ts="595.165" data-end_ts="595.325" title="595.165" id=c_"595.165">__Spa__</span> and the Plugin Rack. And, GI Guitary was already there. And I was so impressed. <span style="color:red" data-ts="600.325" data-end_ts="600.445" title="600.325" id=c_"600.325">__I__</span>, I never connected this to the pedal, impressively enough. And because we were using the DSP, and at one point when we, we got this prototype, I sat down with the guys that were working with me, and I say, guys, this is, this is not possible. This won't work. But, there is something happening now with the PCs, since the smartphones started growing a lot, the PCs manufacturers, especially Intel, they realized that they have to go embedded because it was starting to get clear that the pc, as it is, it's going down, taking, the smartphones and the tablets were taking this market. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>Right? And so with this, I think at Intel, it started putting efforts on smaller form factors for the motor boards. And, we had the mini ITX boards that were done were releasing in 2010. And they were really nice because they were 17 by 17 centimeters. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> 12 volt power supply, you could plug it directly to a 12 volt source. So I say, okay, we, we can put one of these inside a box in the floor that's possible, you know, and Linux at the same time, will give us all the, the necessary code that we need so that we don't need to port everything. It's already running out of the box. It's a pc. Right. And, and we can customize it because it's Linux. We can customize it to the limit on a sense that we take out everything from the oss and, leave it just what's necessary to have the unit in the floor. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>We can control it by network and all these things. So Linux on this sense, was extremely important. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, this decision to move to the pc, or let's say, the generic CPU, this changed everything, Darwin, because then we, we started thinking on a product that it's not more about DSB coding, but actually, how do we do, do we rethink the computer to be on the floor instead of being on the, on our desk? Right. You know, like, let's rethink the PC to become a, an mc, a musical computer, not a PC computer. <laugh>. So this, <span style="color:red" data-ts="723.475" data-end_ts="723.765" title="723.475" id=c_"723.475">__this__</span> was a, a big pivot for us, Darvin. And it changed everything. Changed everything. Because in the beginning, my idea was from a guitar player's point of view. So I want to do a box that has effects that I can change the effects. And when we move it to Linux and we have the entire OSS available to us, then I say, okay, now, now this is not for guitar players anymore. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>This is for everyone because we have all kinds of plugins. We have a media infrastructure already built in this change <span style="color:red" data-ts="752.245" data-end_ts="752.405" title="752.245" id=c_"752.245">__of__</span> the thing. So much, Darwin that it took me, I believe three years to totally understand what the shift meant in terms of the product, because, we, we still kept going on with the effects and adding media, adding some stuff. But then in 2000, it was in 2013 that we realized we released the Mod Quadra in Brazil. And, it was a big flop. It was, well, we are all engineers. We did no marketing effort, <laugh>, we just started selling it. And I say, oh, why don't people buy it? You know, like, it's, it's wonderful <laugh>. Today I look back and I even <span style="color:red" data-ts="788.215" data-end_ts="788.415" title="788.215" id=c_"788.215">__laughed__</span> because I say, okay, this is a joke, right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>Yeah. It's not how you do it, but it's okay. And then, but we got so ma so much feedback with the quadrant from the, the people that tried it. We lent it to so many musicians in Brazil. And, the decision that we had was, okay, so we need a different unit. We need a, a unit that's, smaller with the Quadra. We had, some, lots of off the shelf components. You can do a product with that, but it doesn't look like a mass produced product. It looks like a, a big prototype still. Right. And we said, okay, we have to do a board by ourselves. And to do all of these, we needed scale. And Kickstarter seemed to fit like a glove for that. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Also with that, we had a geographical problem, which is Brazil, the economy in Brazil, it's, it's far from being good for, technologies. We are <span style="color:red" data-ts="841.975" data-end_ts="842.095" title="841.975" id=c_"841.975">__a__</span> agricultural country. So most of our, of our, the economy in Brazil is based on extraction of natural resources or agriculture. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And there's nothing in Brazil, that's even similar to the US or to Europe in terms of producing technology and, developing. And then we said, okay, guys, we have to, to move out of Brazil to make this happen. And then, so with the, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So you're saying there just isn't the infrastructure in <span style="color:red" data-ts="869.875" data-end_ts="870.295" title="869.875" id=c_"869.875">__Brazil__</span> to, to put together a company like this? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>Yes, because the ecosystem for companies, it's not structured for that, dawin, we start with the imports. I see. It's the first thing at all. So everything that we buy, it's imported. And, for example, to make the Quadra, the, the Quadra, we had to import the motherboard. We had to imported displays, lots of components. So in the end, our bill of materials for the Quadra was like, $600. How do you sell a product like that? It's, it's impossible. And, the same bill of materials in, if I bought in the US for example, would be like, 200 and something. So, it's, this doesn't work. And Brazil doesn't have a big market. That's enough to grow a business. So we need to sell abroad as well, but it's impossible to compete. And, so for a num a number of reasons, we said, okay, we're going out of Brazil, and let's use the Kickstarter for that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>Let's guarantee that we have, some sort of sales so that we can move the business with some security to say, okay, we go to a place where this can actually happen. And, we already have pre-sales for that. This was the basic idea. Very naive, I would say. But, we need a bit of, we need to be a bit naive in order to, to have the courage to do things. Huh. And, so, and, we did a Kickstarter. It was, it was awesome. It was, funded. This was in October, 2014. We got 200 pre-sales. While our first decision was to move to the US during the campaign. We got so many, orders from Europe. And, the Linux community is heavily based in Europe. Yes. We for like, my ancestors are from, Italy. My other team members are also Italian from an Italian families. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>So <span style="color:red" data-ts="977.205" data-end_ts="977.405" title="977.205" id=c_"977.205">__what__</span>, for us, getting the visas and get, have an Italian passport. All this is small things. <span style="color:red" data-ts="982.745" data-end_ts="982.965" title="982.745" id=c_"982.745">__Cha__</span> help it a lot to change the plans and not go to the US and go to come to Europe. So we ended up in Berlin that, that that's what happened. Berlin, we, I always liked the German engineering infrastructure for what we are doing, considered the, the quality of the device to be of major importance, really major importance. The, I think that musicians are very fussy with the equipment and well, I am very fussy with my equipment. And, so I wanted to be in a place where I could do the engineering in a local way. We <span style="color:red" data-ts="1015.365" data-end_ts="1015.565" title="1015.365" id=c_"1015.365">__tried__</span> to do some sourcing in China, but, we don't have the experience to that. You need to be a very big company to go to China with, in a safe way, let's say. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>Right. And, here in Germany is where is the place where we found the engineering, the manufacturing, the logistics, everything seems similar to fit right in place. There is all this startup ecosystem coming out in Berlin. Then we have the scene in Berlin with the music companies like Ableton and Native and Bit Wig. So, for a number of reasons, Berlin <span style="color:red" data-ts="1047.755" data-end_ts="1048.045" title="1047.755" id=c_"1047.755">__sent__</span> to us to be like the city to come. And, this is how we ended up here. We finished the Kickstarter campaign here in Berlin. And, this is where we are building the company now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. Well, it's, what a story, but also one that it seems like not only did you make good decisions, but also timing worked out for you. Well, I mean, I can imagine the idea, you know, especially with the, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1074.165" data-end_ts="1074.445" title="1074.165" id=c_"1074.165">__when__</span> the quadrant didn't really hit for you, it could have been very discouraging, and it would've been very hard to say, you know, we're gonna do something that, you know, where we're betting the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1084.605" data-end_ts="1084.885" title="1084.605" id=c_"1084.605">__comp__</span> company on something like the dual and we're gonna move to another country and all this other stuff. It would've been hard to do that without having something like Kickstarter say, here's your first 200 users. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>Oh, no, for sure. I think that Kickstarter, Darwin, it provides some sort of validation, whatever it is. Right. But, I, I, I wouldn't be able to convince myself to do that without this validation <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>'cause you need, you need something to, to, to, to rely on. Yeah. You know, something that, o otherwise you feel like, and especially after the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1122.425" data-end_ts="1122.845" title="1122.425" id=c_"1122.425">__Quadra__</span> Yeah. That we said, okay, that the sales didn't do. So, okay, are we doing a new product? And, and what are, what happens if the sales don't, don't happen again? Are 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>We just, are we just being stupid? Right. Exactly. <laugh>, you worry about that. Right? So, you said that in doing the Kickstarter, you were a little naive. What, what about it now looks naive to you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>The thing is that I think that the biggest thing on being naive is that lots of people consider Kickstarter to be something that will fund you to make the product. And this is very naive. This is very stupid actually. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, the Kickstarter will, will only fund you in terms of presales. So if there is development to be finished, it, that, that development should not at all count on the Kickstarter funds. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. You should have it already <span style="color:red" data-ts="1171.625" data-end_ts="1171.845" title="1171.625" id=c_"1171.625">__de__</span> designed and developed, you're saying, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>Or, option B, which is, you get funding from a company, so like from investors, right? And then you run the Kickstarter only to do the presales, but you need to be extra funded. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And there's, because if you go into this, into this, idea that the Kickstarter backers will fund the development, then you would have to charge for the Kickstarter units more money than you would when they go to the actual market. And that, that doesn't make sense at all, because why would a person in Kickstarter spend even more money <laugh> on something that might not actually happen? It doesn't make sense. Right? They are paying for the, for the others to be, to have the profit. It doesn't make sense at all. In our case, there is one thing that helped it a lot, Darwin. And, this was, a decision that we, we did when we did the Quadra, which is before I had the Quadra in the Christmas of 2011, I finished <span style="color:red" data-ts="1231.585" data-end_ts="1231.805" title="1231.585" id=c_"1231.585">__it__</span> my first, proper <span style="color:red" data-ts="1233.035" data-end_ts="1233.325" title="1233.035" id=c_"1233.035">__prop__</span> prototype, like, the PC base at one with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1236.125" data-end_ts="1236.205" title="1236.125" id=c_"1236.125">__the__</span> mini <span style="color:red" data-ts="1236.805" data-end_ts="1237.165" title="1236.805" id=c_"1236.805">__ITX__</span> inside, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>And with this guy, we did the, the more than one prototype actually. And we went with these, units around to other companies because we were looking for someone to, to do the graphical interface. Okay. At that moment, it was just like, similar to <span style="color:red" data-ts="1253.705" data-end_ts="1253.925" title="1253.705" id=c_"1253.705">__Max__</span>, rectangles that you connect, right? But I wanted the, the pedal <span style="color:red" data-ts="1257.315" data-end_ts="1257.605" title="1257.315" id=c_"1257.315">__like__</span> thing, I wanted to be more friendly. The software that we were using, it was a Windows software. We had to do a Windows one. And, I said, okay, so now we have to do another one. I mean the, the client software to configure the, the, the device. Then I, so, okay, now I need a Mac one and I need a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1275.925" data-end_ts="1276.045" title="1275.925" id=c_"1275.925">__win__</span>, a Windows one and a Linux one, and then comes the smartphones and et cetera. And I was getting crazy with this. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>For me, this is not the way to go, right? Because of Linux and all this thing that Linux has built in its core, which is the network stack. I said, okay, if we are using Linux, let's go for a network approach, like a network abstraction. Mm-Hmm. And we use web technologies so that it becomes platform agnostic. Mm-Hmm. And this was a very smart move. And, one of our most certain decisions, Darwin, because then when we came to do the Kickstarter, we had the Quadra <span style="color:red" data-ts="1309.365" data-end_ts="1309.605" title="1309.365" id=c_"1309.365">__ready__</span>. And when, I mean, the Quadra already, I mean, that, that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1312.935" data-end_ts="1313.095" title="1312.935" id=c_"1312.935">__the__</span>, we already had the GUI that was HTML <span style="color:red" data-ts="1315.575" data-end_ts="1315.855" title="1315.575" id=c_"1315.575">__based__</span>, and everything was running, running inside on the backend was, platform agnostic, mostly Python <span style="color:red" data-ts="1322.825" data-end_ts="1323.175" title="1322.825" id=c_"1322.825">__basic__</span>, right? So the development that we had to do from the, the Quadra to the duo in terms of software was very small. All the development that we had to do here in, Germany was mostly hardware, like, layout the boards and making the, the enclosure. But the, the system itself was ready before the Kickstarter actually happened. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That makes things a lot clearer for me, because it was, it was hard for me to understand. I mean, the graphic user interface, for listeners who aren't familiar with the mod devices system, you really need to go to their site, which is in fact, mod devices.com. You need to go to their site and take a look at what the user interface looks like. It is very refined, it is very intuitive for anybody who is used to working with effects pedals and stuff like that. But it also is clearly the result of a long amount of effort. And so knowing kind of what it takes to put together a chunk of hardware, and also knowing what it takes to do software design, it was hard for me to imagine that, you know, like in 2013, you decided to just, oh, let's start this. And, you know, in a couple of years you had all of this stuff done. So it makes sense that you're actually leveraging all the work you did on the Quadra from a software standpoint. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>There's an interesting thing in that, which is, again, being naive, <laugh>, we, we had the software and, the first take was that, okay, software, we have to do nothing, right? But then <laugh>, then you start, okay, so no, no, but actually we can change this element here on the backend. And oh, since we changed this, let's restructured, you know, you start refactoring stuff because we wanted the duo to be very stable. And so we ended up doing a big chunk of the software again, like refactoring it. And this ended up being a very good thing. Like the, the duo came out more, even more stable than we we ever imagined. And it works like a charm, but it would be possible not to do any of the, the refactorings and still have a product that go to the market, but then we would have maintenance problems. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>Now that would be a nightmare. So this, all these refactoring help it a lot. But they were not blockers. We did them because we said, okay, guys, we are here. We had a great natural improvement, right? Yeah. Yeah. Because we are tired of having all this clunky code here, <laugh>. So let's put a bit of effort, and this is an interesting thing again, that, I, I don't know if it's a strike of luck. I can't say, Darwin, but just the following, when we started doing all of this, if we look at the, these development boards that we see on the market today, like the Bigo board or the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1490.755" data-end_ts="1491.045" title="1490.755" id=c_"1490.755">__Cobi__</span> board, and all these, the Raspberry Pie, which is one of the most famous, if you look at these guys, when we started the, the, the mod as a, as a PC platform, the only board that was a available was the big <span style="color:red" data-ts="1503.985" data-end_ts="1504.205" title="1503.985" id=c_"1503.985">__obo__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>The big <span style="color:red" data-ts="1505.125" data-end_ts="1505.245" title="1505.125" id=c_"1505.125">__O__</span> board was not even the Big <span style="color:red" data-ts="1506.725" data-end_ts="1506.845" title="1506.725" id=c_"1506.725">__O__</span> Bone, right? And when the Bigo board was released, for me, it was like a, a message to say, okay, guys, there's something happening in the technology. And we are very soon going to have full stack Linux running on these small boards. It's just a matter of time. When we did the dual, this was, two years later, we were working on the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1529.925" data-end_ts="1530.045" title="1529.925" id=c_"1529.925">__<inaudible>__</span> board, because it uses the CPU that we have, the A 20 mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, the thing is that what we had for the Kickstarter, the, when you buy a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1539.605" data-end_ts="1539.885" title="1539.605" id=c_"1539.605">__Cobi__</span> board, you have an image of the oss, which is a kind of a, let's say it's a closed image. There's lots of, prop proprietary code, right? Things not properly sorted out. So you can build a root file system out of that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>You can, clean it to the point that you need, but it's still not something that you generated yourself. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1563.945" data-end_ts="1564.165" title="1563.945" id=c_"1563.945">__Or__</span> what I mean is that you can do a product with this, but it's still in a fragile, like a vulnerable position. And the big changes that we did while still, while we're already here in Germany, was to, to try to redo this part of the oss, the very, the very backend of the, the system. And we developed our own build system for the entire OS on a sense that today we have an infrastructure to generate an, an operating system. We can customize it. It's really scalable to do that. And this was something, again, it was not necessary, but now that we have it, it's so comfortable. It's so comfortable because we have a, we are, we, we <span style="color:red" data-ts="1608.085" data-end_ts="1608.365" title="1608.085" id=c_"1608.085">__gain__</span> it some sort of technology window with that. Because now that the trend is like a, a mainstream trend of devices being, independent of independent of the computer again, right? We already have in the market, operating system that is lean, it's optimized to audio, it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1629.285" data-end_ts="1629.525" title="1629.285" id=c_"1629.285">__high__</span>, highly configurable. And, companies will take be between one and two years to develop that, that by their own. So we are being approached by companies to license our, our oss, which is very interesting from a business point of view, huh? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I imagine. Well, but you know, some of what you just said kind of flies in the face of a lot of people's experience. I think I, like so many people have been entranced by the allure of Linux, but the reality of Linux sometimes disappoints, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>For sure. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1661.165" data-end_ts="1661.285" title="1661.165" id=c_"1661.165">__I__</span>, I get very disappointed sometimes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, especially from a media operating system standpoint, it can be very discouraging to not have clarity about what kind of audio interfaces work with it. How do I configure Jack so that it makes sense to, you know, someone with a finfin, nightly sized brain, right? <laugh>, uhhuh, <affirmative>, some of these things, the complexity or the lack of clarity can really get in the way of it being useful. So, I, I am actually curious about, you know, you said that you kind of really got excited about this in the first place based on your experiences using Ubuntu Studio and the, the allure of a Linux based music computer. And now what you've done is you've kind of created something that's a very finely tuned version of that. How much Linux experience did it take, and how much, how much pre-knowledge did you have to have to even be able to understand how to do that? I'm curious about like, how, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>'cause when I, when I approach Linux and want to do something that's media oriented, it's overwhelming. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>Well, I think that if we think with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1743.125" data-end_ts="1743.245" title="1743.125" id=c_"1743.125">__a__</span>, with a desktop, with a desktop mindset, Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, the tools are all there. But the learning curve to use Linux is too big. I consider it to be a blocker. Okay. For me, it was very exciting because, I am, a computer geek, let's say. And I like the idea of spending time configuring the computer. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, actually, let me rephrase that. I like it. The idea, I don't like it anymore. <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>But I use it to, like, in my twenties especially, I love the idea, oh, I can reco, I can recompile the kernel. Yeah, exactly. That's, yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1776.185" data-end_ts="1776.405" title="1776.185" id=c_"1776.185">__No__</span>, like, I'm a hacker. Actually, today, if we look at the team, I am not even involved with that anymore. Darwin, we have team members that are like real Linux experts. When we did the first prototypes that were Linux-based, I was, I was using, slack ware. I don't <span style="color:red" data-ts="1796.005" data-end_ts="1796.045" title="1796.005" id=c_"1796.005">__know__</span> if you are acquainted with Slack. So, yeah. And, I was a big fan of Slack <span style="color:red" data-ts="1801.285" data-end_ts="1801.445" title="1801.285" id=c_"1801.285">__where__</span> I like it, the, the methodology. And what I did was to dump the entire OSS into a compact flashcard, compile my own kernel with the rt, with the realtime patch, right? And that's it. I didn't know customizations at all. I see. And the system just work it because the Kerno is real time, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>And then all the rest was our own software. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Today, when I look at the OSS that runs inside the, the duo, it's some, it's a totally different beast. All the packages that are there have a reason to be there. And they are all optimized for our platform. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1834.835" data-end_ts="1835.125" title="1834.835" id=c_"1834.835">__That__</span> this is the, the, the work that I said that we've been doing on refactoring and making all these oss, this is a proper one. But I am not personally capable of doing that. I have people here in my team to do that. Sure. That are very good in doing that. But I'm not, as I said, my, my quick and dirty solution in the prototypes was to put slack <span style="color:red" data-ts="1855.285" data-end_ts="1855.525" title="1855.285" id=c_"1855.285">__wear__</span> and just, you know, to be on the safe side, let's put all the packages right, and that's it. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Just in case. No, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>Just in case, you know, oh, but there is this printer package. No, just put it, just put it just in case. And, but that doesn't work on <span style="color:red" data-ts="1870.285" data-end_ts="1870.405" title="1870.285" id=c_"1870.285">__a__</span> production environment. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So now, you have built, quite a team behind this, behind this setup. When I go to your site and I look at your, you know, your people's page, you've got eight people now currently working on this. Now you have a lot to do. And on one hand, eight people may not seem like a lot, but on the other hand, for someone just kind of starting to get some momentum, it's gotta feel like a lot of people, to help support. Now, I assume that what you have is you have some very specific software and hardware development people on board, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>Yep. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So what, what do you do besides, do interviews with podcast guys? <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>Oh, okay. I do everything that the, the, the team. It's not as, assigned to do. Got it. So everything that is on the, on the black sack, you know, we don't have a person for this task. So that's me, <laugh>. And, as A-C-A-C-E-O, I must, ensure that we have the money to keep on Right. Moving. That's my, my two main duties are these ones, <laugh>. I do a lot of technical development, Darwin on the mechanical side, we don't have a mechanical engineer, a part of me. So I designed the enclosures. Everything that's mechanical, it's with me also. Okay. But I want to move out of that as well. Being on the management position and on the execution position at the same time. It's very, it's very bad. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, if nothing else too, it's really hard to get frustrated with yourself when you don't <laugh> have time to do everything. Right. Uhhuh, <affirmative> as, as a result of, of this kinda stuff. And you, you moved to Berlin. Did you, did you bring your team from Brazil to Berlin? Or did you move to Berlin and pull a team together once you got there? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>It's a mixture. Oh, okay. We, we brought some, some people, and we, we added people while we were here. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Got it. How long have you been <span style="color:red" data-ts="1990.605" data-end_ts="1990.685" title="1990.605" id=c_"1990.605">__in__</span>, how long have you been in Berlin? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1992.605" data-end_ts="1992.845" title="1992.605" id=c_"1992.605">__moved__</span>, we moved in Berlin, January, 2015. Okay. We, we came with, with some people, but some people even departed, actually, this move to Berlin was interesting. Darwin, I don't know. Well, cycling's, it's a much, older company. I think that the company, especially with the product like the dual, or let's say, let's say the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2011.785" data-end_ts="2012.005" title="2011.785" id=c_"2011.785">__mod__</span> Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, it's very easy to get kind of this fantasy, you know, the startup thing and oh, this product is all, and so it's very easy to get kind of deluded by that <laugh>. So coming with the team here was nice, you know, from a company point of view, because you trim out the people that are not, you know, like they are kind of, yeah, let's do it, but Right. You, you need a bit more of than this shallow excitement you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Need. You need real commitment in order to come through. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>Yeah. It's a, it's commit commitment plus love, you know, and if you don't have those ones, you know, in the proper dose, it doesn't happen. Right. And I think that the move to Berlin, although very painful, it was very useful on the sense to like, to have the team only the, the members that actually matter. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it seems like also, Berlin, unlike even the United States, like everyone talks about Silicon Valley as being a place where there's funding available and stuff. That's true. If you're trying to like do the next, pet food web company or something. Right. It seems like Berlin is actually the heart of music funding and or funding for music technology and stuff like that. Did, did you in any way find it easier to get sort of like the infrastructure support there? Or was it harder because there was so much competition from other companies? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>That's a tricky question. Darwin, because when you come to Berlin, you have, I think that you have two, two big groups. Let's say. One of them is the German traditional, you know, the people that were already here, the Ableton slash Native Instruments group. Right. Which is the companies that they rose by the early two thousands. And, so now they are established at companies, and they were funded by the, the Bank of Berlin, very local thing. Right, okay. For a local. And then there's a second thing, which is this startup, you know, like this next Silicon Valley thing that it started to happening here in Berlin, which is much more to the pet food, as you were saying that the, the music thing <laugh>. Okay. Because then, then the mindset, it's the same, you know, oh, I, I want to make a, I want to invest in a company to make <span style="color:red" data-ts="2150.485" data-end_ts="2150.605" title="2150.485" id=c_"2150.485">__a__</span> a hundred fold, in five years. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2153.145" data-end_ts="2153.365" title="2153.145" id=c_"2153.145">__Oh__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Yeah. And then get out. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>Exactly. But, so, but for a music company, which is already kind of niche, if you think like <span style="color:red" data-ts="2160.605" data-end_ts="2160.725" title="2160.605" id=c_"2160.605">__a__</span> worldwide and, a hardware company come on five years, I'm working more than five years already on that. Right. It's, you know, it, it doesn't convince the, these kind of investors, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>For us, it makes much more sense to go for public funding and et cetera. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But at the same time, then instead of Berlin, we have other options. Belgium, we, there are lots of these public bodies in, in Europe in general to, to, to raise, raise funds for that. And, so I don't think it's a strictly German thing or Berlin thing. And actually because of this new mainstream startup scene coming on, I think that it's even making it worse to raise money for the, for the actual, you know, the Berlin core stuff. Right. Because it's, the focus is shifting to more of the Silicon Valley, mindset model. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, and then also, you, you are in, probably, you're probably in the worst position from getting funding, which is that, you know, you're, you have an actual product, so you can't try selling a dream 'cause you can point to the thing, you know, and so it's gotta be realistic, you know, you have to have, you have to talk in terms of realism. Like here's a real thing we have to sell. But now the people that are, you're asking to invest, they can't pretend what they're investing in. They have to look at it and, and buy into it. Right. And it seems like investors, as soon as they have something real <laugh>, it's, it's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>Not 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Anymore. It's not cool anymore. Right. It's hilarious, but it's true. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>Although this makes the things, you are totally right. Darwin, for us, it's much more difficult to raise money because of this. We are not selling a dream anymore. Right. Well, it's still a dream on the sense that where we can get, but the, the first step, it's already here, but this, I think that has an upside, which is the people that agree to invest in us, they, it's very clear and it's very transparent. What is the reality? Right? And, and then you don't have <span style="color:red" data-ts="2281.585" data-end_ts="2281.805" title="2281.585" id=c_"2281.585">__the__</span>, those things that really take my sleep off, which is to get some kind of investor that will try to, to, to liquidate you in two years because you didn't reach some kind of crazy metrical, right? Yeah, exactly. No, no. There, there's no, there's no myth myths here. It's, this is the only reality. These are the sales that we are doing, and if we put this amount of money, we can get to this number. And that's it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that makes, yeah, that makes a lot of sense. You can put something on their desk, and if they buy into it, that kind of tells you what kind of investor they are. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>Exactly. Exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. Very smart. So you kind of mentioned where this can go, and I think that anybody who looks at your software hardware combination immediately can imagine the directions that you can take this. Right? But why don't, why don't we let you make them more concrete? What are, what do you see as the future for the mod devices ecosystem? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>That's a question, Darwin that I actually only managed to, to answer to myself quite recently, which is, what are we in the end? And, the conclusion that we got is that we are doing a new digital platform for musicians in a very broad sense. Let, let's think on the computer again. So there is this digital revolution going on, smartphones, tablets, the PC itself, the internet, all these things. And in order to participate on this revolution that's going on, we need some sort of device. So the pc, the Mac, the, the iPhone, these are all the devices that are the enablers for us to move into this revolution that's going on the iot, let's say. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And the thing is that if we look at the, at the population in the world, and we think about the musicians, we musicians, we are a very limited group. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>I would say something about between one and 2% of the population, people actually creating music. So when you have the, the, the companies that do those digital devices, they're not thinking on the musicians. They're thinking on anyone but the musicians. And then the musicians have to adapt to that. So this is how you come out with these, amplitudes and guitar rigs and stuff that, okay, I'm running my computer, but I'm using my guitar, so I need an audio interface, and now I need an external controller. And you'd have to assemble this Frankenstein, right? Actually, and this is happening because the, the company's doing the computers themselves, they're not thinking on the musicians. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, they're thinking on people on desks, typing stuff and looking things on the screen. That's it. And when we think on the musician and how the musician performs, this changes everything in terms of what are the requirements Ergon wise, for example, for this device. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>And so what I think that we do on <span style="color:red" data-ts="2454.805" data-end_ts="2454.925" title="2454.805" id=c_"2454.805">__a__</span>, the very broad sense, we do a new platform, which is not a smartphone, it's not a tablet, it's not a pc, like a desktop computer. We do the mod device and the mod device. It's kind of a computer, but it's meant for the performing musicians going from this point, what we see ourselves doing in the future, it's a complete array of different devices for not different, musicians, but different use cases. So we have the duo, for example, the duo. I like it a lot that it, it does all the work that a single musician needs. So it doesn't matter if he plays the guitar, if he plays the keyboard, if <span style="color:red" data-ts="2493.785" data-end_ts="2494.005" title="2493.785" id=c_"2493.785">__he__</span> sings, the duo can make it all. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But the duo already introduces one part of the concept that I find to be very rich, which is you can have two musicians using the same device, because we have the two inputs, and you can assemble independent chains for each of them. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>So you could have a singer and a guitar player, for example, if you add the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2515.485" data-end_ts="2515.725" title="2515.485" id=c_"2515.485">__media__</span> part via USB, you can even have three musicians, or four, let's say. And this brings, for me, is the seed of an idea, which I've, it's part of my dream, which is the processor for the band today. When we think on music and we think on a band plane, each musician has his own stack of equipment, his own gear. And what we do is we go together in a room, and then each of us play with our own gear, and the sound is mixed in the air physically. So let's think that we have everybody connected to the same mod, and the mod has multiple inputs. And so we are mixing all this, this music that is being done, it's being mixed it while still on the digital domain. And then we go to the amplification and the things that go out in the air on the sound. It's already the final mix. This brings so many interesting possibilities, Darwin, because then we have, because everything is on the same digital domain, it means that we can have things like the kick drum setting, the tempo of the delay of the guitar player or the vocals modulating the bass. You know, you can go to new compositional possibilities <span style="color:red" data-ts="2588.075" data-end_ts="2588.365" title="2588.075" id=c_"2588.075">__that__</span> are not feasible. Now, when we have individual equipment, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>They're either not feasible or else they're just too much of a hassle to bother with, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>Oh, yeah. You would have to do a, a big art installation to do that. <laugh> not something that you can have out of the box and you can carry around, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Not on stage for sure. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>This is, for me, when I think of where we're heading, Darwin, it's something like that, like this, it's this computing platform in which it can serve from the individual musician to the entire band. And, I think that this is so exciting because so many compositional possibilities come out of that. So, and, these <span style="color:red" data-ts="2623.845" data-end_ts="2624.005" title="2623.845" id=c_"2623.845">__are__</span>, I think it's kind of a division on the very long term. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that's, that's quite a vision, but also it's one that it, it really does make sense because, you know, certainly from electronic musician standpoint, interaction from device device is getting to be a big thing anyway. But it sure would be interesting if your drummer and bass player and singer could also be part of that matrix of interaction. So that's, that's a really neat vision. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>Yes. And the, and the important thing here, Darwin is that, this is my Brazilian show <span style="color:red" data-ts="2655.805" data-end_ts="2656.085" title="2655.805" id=c_"2655.805">__telling__</span>, okay? Okay. For we Brazilians having a button to set the temple, it's a big sin. No, we are, we are the rhythm country, right. So for us to set a temple, 120 BPM, this doesn't make sense at all. At all, <laugh>. And what I like about this, this idea of having everything mix it in the digital domain is that you can have the things still organic, very organic on the performance sense, but it's still very digital and very modern on the actual sound. Right. But, you know, so everything is interconnected, but I am setting the tempo organically, for example. Right. You know, like everything is connected, everything is in sync, but the master tempo, it's something that's real and alive, and it's not a crystal that it's giving me a Yeah. An exact tempo. Right. And this, for me, it's a big thing. Darwin, it's a real big thing. It's the difference between humans and machines <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? Well, and it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2711.365" data-end_ts="2711.485" title="2711.365" id=c_"2711.365">__a__</span> thing, inevitably, whenever in the past, whenever electronic music has become, you know, somewhat above ground, what ends up kind of defeating it is like a very human music, right. Uhhuh <affirmative>. And it seems like there has to be a way to make a more human variation of electronic music. And it seems like you have got the kernel of something there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>Oh, David's what we're looking at, huh. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Our time is, is pretty much up. I want to thank you for spending this time, but before I let you go, I have one last question, which is just a one of curiosity for me. You have made a device that kind of can be anything. I, I was goofing around with it one day, and I literally made a device, I hooked up a midi, controller to it. So I had access to a bunch of sliders and buttons, and I made a device that was like eight simultaneous loopers along with a wave shaper and stuff like this. It was a ridiculous arrangement, but it was fun for playing for a day. Right. Okay. I'm curious, as a guitar player yourself and knowing the system intimately and knowing that you have literally every kind of processor available when you work with the mod device pedal, what does your arrangement look like? What do you use 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b><laugh>? Okay. I have to divide the answer in two parts. Okay. Part one, Jean Franco, the guitar player that, with his traditional guitars. Okay. Right. And, for me, the mode is a pedal. I like, I like setting very simple paddleboards, very simple ones like, chorus and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2812.145" data-end_ts="2812.495" title="2812.145" id=c_"2812.145">__delay__</span>. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, very simple ones. And they are all there. And I just put it out of the box, plug the guitar and play. You know, it's, it's the most dumb and simple use case that we have. That's my use case, <laugh>. It's like, it's how I like it. Okay. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2826.755" data-end_ts="2826.975" title="2826.755" id=c_"2826.755">__Yep__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gianfranco: </b>Then, comes another guitarist, John Franco, guitar player, which is, the media guitars. I bought a good <span style="color:red" data-ts="2834.535" data-end_ts="2834.655" title="2834.535" id=c_"2834.535">__d__</span> with the triple play recently. Yes. So I can input the duo with the midi, that's Exonic. So polyphonic midi plus the real guitar. And, this opened it so many doors for me on the musical sense. Then I do very crazy stuff. I, I actually don't even use the, the pickups anymore. I use only the synth, but <span style="color:red" data-ts="2855.045" data-end_ts="2855.165" title="2855.045" id=c_"2855.045">__I__</span>, but I played it with the guitar because I cannot play the Keys. Right. I'm not a keyboard player. Right. But I love the sound of the synths. So for me, the idea of playing that synth sounds like the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2864.565" data-end_ts="2864.685" title="2864.565" id=c_"2864.565">__P__</span> mode, but using my guitar in the fretboard, this is, it's, I love it. I really love it. It's, it's so much fun. It's what I've been using the most, I, I think on this, mod Duo approach. And I do this crazy paddleboards like that. But when we go only for the very simple guitar, I'm a, I'm a very basic guy. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. Well, I think that anyone who just heard what you said though also hears both your commitment and your love for the product. And so that, that makes you a very good CEO for this company. <laugh>, Jean Franco, I want <span style="color:red" data-ts="2898.125" data-end_ts="2898.165" title="2898.125" id=c_"2898.125">__to__</span> thank you so much for taking the time. This was a fascinating chat and, and, and great fun. It was good catching up with you, but also great hearing the story of how, how you, how this company came about and where, what direction you imagine it going. It's really fascinating.
