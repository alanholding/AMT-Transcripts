<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, today I get a chance to talk to, my good friend coworker, just all around fantastic musician, Tom Hall Tom was, first visit us with us way back, for podcast number 37. It was where we kind of dove in and found out what a kid from Tasmania, what the hell he was doing in la, making music <laugh>, and, and cutting max patches. And, he has been doing nothing but like raising up dust ever since then. And so he's got a release coming up pretty soon. We'll have him talk about that. But with that, I'm gonna say hi to Tom Hall Hey Tom, how's it going? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom Hall: </b>Hey, Darwin, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thank you so much for taking the time to have a chat. I really appreciate it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Yeah, my pleasure. I mean, it's, it's good to be back. I'm glad I'm still alive. <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Kicking. And we're here. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So why don't you fill people in a little bit on what you're, what you're doing right now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Right now I'm actually kind of wrapping up an, an album, which feels pretty momentous. This one's been a bit of a slow burner and a real process. And, that comes out June 5th called Spectra. And I'm kind of just getting together, you know, the kind of PR cycle that goes along with an album, and getting all the stuff out and the EPK and all of that. It's one of the more tedious things of releasing your music, I think. But nonetheless, I'm excited to, to get it, get it out in the wild. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Yeah. Well, you sent me the EPK to prepare for this and, I had heard one piece that you had shared earlier, but I kind of got to listen to, to all of the release. It's, it's pretty amazing. But also the presentation of the, of the press kit is pretty cool. I think a a lot of people would be curious about, sort of the release process. First of all, you're releasing this on, it's on cd on downloads, and are <span style="color:red" data-ts="141.245" data-end_ts="141.365" title="141.245" id=c_"141.245">__you__</span>, are you doing cas you're doing cassette releases also, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Yeah. Okay. Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What label is releasing this and where are they going to be sending stuff out of? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>So this is Eli Records, or Ellie Records, out of France. And they're doing mail order, on their website if you just go to Ellie Media. Okay. And they're sending out to CDs and cassettes from there. But they've, a lot of discussion went into the pricing and the likes, and it, I think it's very reasonable pricing considering where they're sending from. And they're also including worldwide shipping, so. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>I actually will only have, I'll only have copies at live shows, so Yeah. They're taking care of everything and they've actually done tremendous job in, everything, the artwork, getting it together. Mastering Yeah. I'm, I'm stoked to have them. They actually found me. Oh yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So nice. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>They, they saw me talking about releasing something, just throwing it out there, and I was going to, you know, get it together myself. And this was all posted on an Instagram story. Right. And next thing they're messaging me and saying, we wanna do it, we wanna release it. Oh, that's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Fantastic. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>So, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's interesting 'cause I talked to Dmitri, SSC and, he was talking about one of the pains of being, of doing self-release stuff is that for a lot of electronic music, the market for it is worldwide. Hmm. But there's a lot of scenarios where people who aren't in your country are really have a real disincentive to get your release, just because shipping costs a lot of times can exceed the cost of the release itself, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Yeah. I've actually seen that come that that's really come about in the last eight to 10 years. I mean, I think late 2009, 2010, you could still ship a cassette back to Australia or vice versa for just a couple of dollars and now it's, now it's 10 $13 <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>To and the, to ship a $5 cassette. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That's crazy. Well, the other thing that's, that's kind of rough is that there are so few distributors left for this stuff. Yeah. So it's not like you can get a label that has a good relationship with the distributor and build off of that. The distribution networks have just been really torn to pieces. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Yeah, it's so true. I mean, as far as distribution goes, I think it might only extend as far as me taking a couple of physical cassettes around to a few record stores in, in Los Angeles, and that'll be about it. Right? Yeah. It's sad. It's, it's, especially for things that are not, you know, kinda mainstream releases, you're just never gonna get these, the remaining distributors, they're not gonna, they're just not gonna take on a hundred cassettes and distribute them. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right, exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Or, or cd. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So when we last talked, which was back in 2014, <laugh>, you were, you were kind of getting into some analog stuff. You were deep, deep into Max. You still were pining for, for the opportunity to work more on your Nord Modular. The world has kinda shifted a lot for you since then. You are part of what I consider the LA Modular Mafiaa, <laugh>, you know, this group of people that, that knows each other and plays around a lot with each other and stuff like that. You've gotten pretty active in doing performances, in fact, including some pretty heavy duty performances, but also doing these, doing releases and doing, doing work with a lot of other people. So really the, a big change has been your interaction with modular. What is it that, for you that that made the modular the right thing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>I think it was a, a few things, and, and I'll try and do it justice. I think it was a, a few things I had, my wife and I were living in a pretty small apartment at the time in, in Venice, and I had a lot of leftover gear from Australia that I'd, I'd bought to America. And it was a lot of, you know, like a cog Poly 800, a mog, little fatty, and a lot of, a lot of things with key beds. And they'd take up a lot of space. Right. I think you saw that actually. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, I did. I, <span style="color:red" data-ts="416.865" data-end_ts="417.085" title="416.865" id=c_"416.865">__the__</span>, the thing I mostly remember was the long stretch of Moger Foggers <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Yes. And see, the funny thing is the Moger Fogger pedal was actually literally my first foray into like modular because I, I got them as these kind of like, and Lawrence English actually put me onto them as these great devices for adding kind of like character and sound to your in the box recordings by literally kind of like amping back out through them. Uhhuh <affirmative>, in my exploratory nature, I noticed all of these jacks on the back and started plugging them into one another, which are all CV control jacks. And they essentially created a modular synthesizer, although albeit a, a big and expensive one. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>So I just, you know, with the, the need for space. So <span style="color:red" data-ts="467.565" data-end_ts="467.645" title="467.565" id=c_"467.565">__it__</span> had this realization that I could sell all of them and actually end up with a, a nice kind of URAC system for the, for the money. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. And in actually smaller space, I mean, a lot of people right, say modular is like two space intensive, but compared to a pile of pedals, it can be pretty compact. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="487.945" data-end_ts="488.165" title="487.945" id=c_"487.945">__Yep__</span>. So, and at the time I was like, okay, so okay, I'm gonna sell these. And then I kind of, you know, my whole vision for building a modular system was to kind of continue to do the sound I liked kind of explorations into granular synthesis and the legs, but do it on hardware. So like to go, to be able to pretty much seamlessly move out of max in the afternoon and flip over to the hardware and kind of keep evolving the similar sound. So, you know, I've, mutable Instruments had, <span style="color:red" data-ts="525.115" data-end_ts="525.405" title="525.115" id=c_"525.115">__well__</span> only just announced the clouds. Actually my friend Gregory Taylor brought that to my attention. And so I actually pre-ordered it. I think it might still be the only module I've ever pre-ordered <laugh> <laugh>. But I wanted to be, I wanted to assure that I had it, but also, at the time, Olivia from Mutable Instruments was still doing his own sales. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Like, he, I didn't think he was even selling through, I don't think he even was selling through shops in the, in America or anything. He was running his own shop and he had these B stock items that he would sell. And it was insane. Like, he was selling peaks and at the time, the American dollar was super strong against the Euro, and he was, you could pick up a peaks that literally looked, you couldn't even understand why it was a B stock. I think maybe a trace was missing and he would fix it, so it was perfect. And he would even sell them with a warranty, and the peaks would be like $50. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh my God. So I, I remember when the branches first came out, I got one like that and I got a B stock, and when it came, I looked at it and I literally could not figure out what made it a B stock 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Exactly. No one. And, and we're not the only ones. It was a lot of people who picked them up. But I, I literally bought, like, just converted a few, mo <span style="color:red" data-ts="609.905" data-end_ts="610.125" title="609.905" id=c_"609.905">__fog__</span> pedals into a lot of mutable instrument <laugh> modules. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>I mean, at one stage my entire case was just mutable. Interesting. Yeah. So that was like, kind of how I got into it. And, and it just, <span style="color:red" data-ts="625.655" data-end_ts="625.815" title="625.655" id=c_"625.655">__it__</span> made sense in terms of space and sound. And, until then I'd had a small kind of five <span style="color:red" data-ts="632.655" data-end_ts="632.935" title="632.655" id=c_"632.655">__year__</span> system that I kind of like, kind of got it from a friend Andrew <span style="color:red" data-ts="638.315" data-end_ts="638.535" title="638.315" id=c_"638.315">__psk__</span> through doing bits of work for him and stuff like that. I still love that system and use it a lot actually, when I want that rich, deep analog sound. Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="648.495" data-end_ts="648.655" title="648.495" id=c_"648.495">__Yeah__</span>. It punches it out. You know, I also wanted to do that kind of more granular digital kind of exploration that I really love. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So I got a chance to listen to the album, and I would strongly recommend for the listeners to, to get out there and check it out. It's, it's an amazing piece of work. One of the things I'd say is having, having heard your work in the past, there, there are some things that are very identifiably you, and there are some things that are kind of new sounding, at least to my ears. One of the things that I feel like you've done is, you've kind of gone for less of a differentiation between analog and digital sounds, and everything kind of sounds like a hybrid in some way. Right. And I, I think maybe we could even say that now is sort of like a time of the hybrids anyway. 'cause Eurorack mod modular systems are getting filled with digital modules Mm-Hmm. <span style="color:red" data-ts="710.775" data-end_ts="710.815" title="710.775" id=c_"710.775">__<affirmative>__</span> and, and digital systems are doing all kinds of things to model analog gear down to the component level. And you're seeing a lot of efforts to sort of like drive each side of that chasm towards the center. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Most definitely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What are some of the things that, that are for you represent hallmarks of that kind of hybrid sound and, and where's it coming from on your systems? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Yeah, I mean, I, before this interview, I kind of just looked at all my tracks and thought about this, and I'm in the, in the midst of kind of riding up a tell, tell all for the album, for the, for the label. And, yeah, it really is hybrid. I mean, hybrid is such a great way to, to say, and I mean something that as I get associated with <span style="color:red" data-ts="764.365" data-end_ts="764.925" title="764.365" id=c_"764.365">__Eurorack__</span> and Max, I'm, I'm okay with people knowing what tools they use, but something I always try to do sonically is just transcend the equipment. That's really important to me because I tend to work quite <span style="color:red" data-ts="780.305" data-end_ts="780.525" title="780.305" id=c_"780.305">__out__</span>, you know, conceptually it does bugged me a little bit where I'm like, oh, that's <span style="color:red" data-ts="785.325" data-end_ts="785.445" title="785.325" id=c_"785.325">__a__</span> clouds there, there's a clouds, there's <laugh>, there's a, there's a 3 0 1, there's a 1 0 1. You know, and plus, you know, I have these tools and I have the skills to use and, and swap and change for Max to modular, to, to nod modular to, to synth. So I just tend to just use the <span style="color:red" data-ts="808.365" data-end_ts="808.565" title="808.365" id=c_"808.365">__parts__</span> that I need to get the sound I'm, I'm kind of shooting for. So it's kind of really hard to say, to pinpoint an album if there's maybe one track where it's just like, almost definitively in one instrument. It's the last track, last retreat. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, which is mostly ler easel, but it descends into max processing at the end. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, that was one of the tracks that I also kind of identified as something that sorta was your, you were into, but kind of was, is really, more fully explored on this release. And that's your kind of embrace of the big drone, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you have, your music has always had, well, the way, and I'd like to talk about this a little bit in a minute, it's always been sort of like cinematic without using like al samples, right? Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="864.685" data-end_ts="864.885" title="864.685" id=c_"864.685">__In__</span>, in many ways it sounds like it could be orchestral except there's no identifiable al instrumentation. Mm-Hmm. But this time it seems like a, a lot of times there was sort of like this integration of that into sort of like much even longer form drone things where in instead of in a cinematic way, moving through a narrative, it would kind of land in a space and just be allowed to blossom over time. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Is that, is that a lot of times one of the problems with drones is, is like, it can either seem like repetitive or just stale, right? Mm-Hmm. And so one of the big things in order to make a drone a compelling is to find ways to sort of like, have inner voices constantly moving or changing or interacting. I'm wondering with something like Bulo, <span style="color:red" data-ts="914.565" data-end_ts="914.765" title="914.565" id=c_"914.565">__which__</span> on the surface seems like a relatively simple instrument, how you can get a complex enough tone going to really pull off that kind of drone <span style="color:red" data-ts="923.925" data-end_ts="924.165" title="923.925" id=c_"923.925">__like__</span> environment? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Yeah, it's a few things. I mean, it's, it's that additional sequencing section of the <span style="color:red" data-ts="932.625" data-end_ts="932.845" title="932.625" id=c_"932.625">__ler__</span> and being able to treat like the, the main oscillator and, and the modulator as separate voices. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Okay. A you know, like a lot can really be done there to add nuances to the sound and still kind of have this underbed of drone. Right. And the LER can do feedback as well. You have that external input, so, oh, you can <span style="color:red" data-ts="958.205" data-end_ts="958.325" title="958.205" id=c_"958.205">__I__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Think about that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Yeah. And it's this thing <span style="color:red" data-ts="960.605" data-end_ts="960.725" title="960.605" id=c_"960.605">__I__</span>, you know, and I only just recently saw perhaps the first person that I've seen that I know of processing stuff, like, you can literally use it like I was using the old mugger pedals as a, like, amping tool. You can like literally throw anything back through the ula Oh, neat. And, and get all that beautiful crusty circuitry, right. Character. And so what I was doing was, I just, with the ler, when I say the end of that track descended into max processing was actually filling a buffer inside of Max de delaying it in sync in synchronicity with the rate which I was playing, and then feeding elements of it back into the mix. So it was like, like kind of like using Max as a glorious delay pedal <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>But like feeding it back into that external input on the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1018.165" data-end_ts="1018.365" title="1018.165" id=c_"1018.165">__ler__</span>, why I was still playing that track was just one take. I mean, I, I kind of ran through the, what I was gonna play a few times. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, it wasn't like, it's, it's, there's no, no able <span style="color:red" data-ts="1031.885" data-end_ts="1032.085" title="1031.885" id=c_"1031.885">__doing__</span> live cut and pasting <laugh>. Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1033.965" data-end_ts="1034.165" title="1033.965" id=c_"1033.965">__Right__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I was kind of curious though about the mechanism you go through with, with composition on this stuff, because Right. On one hand some of it sounds very composed, and on the other hand, some of it sounds like captured exploration, you know? Right. And I'm just wondering, so like the things that sound especially composed are things where you have like one sequence line with a contra line underneath it that sort of like gives it implied chord changes. Right. Right. Or some of these bigger cinematic like cordal efforts, you know, these seem very composed where other things seem like they could be, could have been an improvisation that you were lucky enough to have the tape deck rolling on. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Right. So there's certainly those pieces on my album. I mean, one track that stands out that it, you know, was very improvised was probably vast limitations. Okay. And that was like kind of a just, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1096.665" data-end_ts="1096.885" title="1096.665" id=c_"1096.665">__hey__</span>, I spent a whole bunch of time programming off some custom patches on the Norley too, which is like the first big boy synth I ever bought <laugh>, like outside of like <span style="color:red" data-ts="1108.535" data-end_ts="1108.885" title="1108.535" id=c_"1108.535">__Casio__</span> Ssk ones and, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1111.355" data-end_ts="1111.645" title="1111.355" id=c_"1111.355">__Core__</span> Pianos and stuff. Right. But like, the Nor <span style="color:red" data-ts="1114.435" data-end_ts="1114.725" title="1114.435" id=c_"1114.435">__Lead__</span> two was the first synth that just that I got, I was just in love with and I still love it to bits, but I hadn't dug around on it for a while. And actually I'm gonna name drop here, but I'm fortunate enough to, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1130.595" data-end_ts="1130.885" title="1130.595" id=c_"1130.595">__true__</span> working at Stockman 74 to get to talk to some, you know, pretty amazing artists. And one guy I, I get to talk to semi-regularly is Sean Booth from <span style="color:red" data-ts="1141.305" data-end_ts="1141.525" title="1141.305" id=c_"1141.305">__aca__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>And Sean's, Sean's great, like 90, 95% of the time we do, we don't even talk about sound. We talk about random shit like politics and, and the likes. But, we just somehow got onto the topic of, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1156.465" data-end_ts="1156.685" title="1156.465" id=c_"1156.465">__and__</span> our joint love of Nords in, he was raving on about the nor lead too. And he actually didn't know that I had one. He was just saying what a beast it is and how it's the, the best of the leads and it's phenomenal what you can get out of it if you just spend some time like just get way off of any of the precept patches and build your own from the ground up. And it kind of just inspired me to dig into my own Nord on another level. Right. And yeah, I honestly was blown away with what I was able to get into. I mean, the thing is just a beast, it's kind of mind boggling that that thing came out like nearly 20 years ago. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I know. Well I had a Nord lead one when they came out and so like, I am like that group of people that's like, well, it's never been as good as the Nord lead one. Right. What is it that about the two that, that both you and Sean seem to focus on as being best of breed 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Sonically? I believe sonically the lead one and two are the same. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1221.115" data-end_ts="1221.405" title="1221.115" id=c_"1221.115">__Okay__</span>. I know for a fact that the DAC conversion on the outputs is a weird, it's 14 bits. Oh 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Wow. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Okay. And I believe them to be the same. The thing that that the, the two increased polyphony, I think the first one was limited <span style="color:red" data-ts="1241.345" data-end_ts="1241.565" title="1241.345" id=c_"1241.345">__and__</span> maybe how did it have eight voices? Maybe there 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1245.165" data-end_ts="1245.205" title="1245.165" id=c_"1245.165">__Was__</span> it something like that. And then you had to buy an expander if <span style="color:red" data-ts="1247.565" data-end_ts="1247.685" title="1247.565" id=c_"1247.565">__you__</span> wanted. Right. Which nobody could even find. Right. So most people didn't have them <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>It was vaporware <laugh>. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>But yeah, I did the LY two came with 16 by standard. Yeah. Where it just went to crap was, when they made the two x 'cause they changed the 24 bit and all of a sudden the sound was glistening and nice and clean and yeah. I think that's what changed it. Oh, interesting. I mean, I think the two has kind of, there's some somewhat other element I not in front of it right now, but I think the two added a second LFO or added a, a mod bus or something. Okay. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1286.565" data-end_ts="1286.765" title="1286.565" id=c_"1286.565">__Alright__</span>. There's one element extra on the two that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1289.205" data-end_ts="1289.285" title="1289.205" id=c_"1289.205">__was__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Programming element. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Yeah. One pram programming element on the front that's different. I forget which one, but Yeah. But I think the, the one and the two before they made the two Xs, they're kind of in the ballpark Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> similar sonic character and territory. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But we kind of got into that discussion talking about the compositional technique too, and the fact that that that kind of drew you in. What, for you, what represents the process of composing? I mean, is it, do you sort of do a lot of experiments that you capture and then composite it somewhere else? Or do you, I mean, do you like score it either graphically or notation or what is, what is the process that you do to actually do the composition part of your work? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>I, I would say 100% of the time, it always starts with improvising. It's always, it's always, you know, I, I don't sit down to write a specific piece in mind. I'm not a trained musician. And everything that I have <span style="color:red" data-ts="1358.645" data-end_ts="1358.925" title="1358.645" id=c_"1358.645">__learned__</span> is all mostly being self-taught. Okay. So it's not like I'm like, oh, I'm gonna write a piece. But it's, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1366.445" data-end_ts="1366.605" title="1366.445" id=c_"1366.445">__that__</span> generally just starts off by, you know, improvising on something, whatever it takes my eye in the studio at the time. And just getting into a place where I'm sonically feeling, getting that feeling, you know, and trying to get an emotion or like sparked an emotion in myself. And then I'll extend it. Then I might write it to midi or lock it into a sequence <span style="color:red" data-ts="1394.605" data-end_ts="1394.805" title="1394.605" id=c_"1394.605">__or__</span> in the modular or jotted down in Ableton live on the piano roll. But, you know, sometimes it, it's sometimes the process getting there can be very hybrid. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Like, sometimes I try to keep <span style="color:red" data-ts="1409.765" data-end_ts="1409.885" title="1409.765" id=c_"1409.765">__a__</span>, a little keyboard in front of me at the desk at all time. It's actually in front of my keyboard, keyboard, a little tuia key step. And it's plugged in all the time. So I can fire up, live in a plugin and have music in 10 seconds, something like that. And sometimes I like to kind of try and stay nimble with scales and chords and whatever stuff I'm teaching myself, you know, little ideas, I'll jot them down and have so many able to projects with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1440.795" data-end_ts="1441.085" title="1440.795" id=c_"1440.795">__mini__</span> clips in them that I'll probably never get back to, but <laugh>. Right, right. But at the time, that's some kind of like chord or note progression that I, that I felt something. Sometimes that piece will get extended inside of life. It might never get out of the box, in fact. Right. It might go over to Max. It might be processed by Max <span style="color:red" data-ts="1462.995" data-end_ts="1463.285" title="1462.995" id=c_"1462.995">__Live__</span>, but then alternatively, I'm a big fan of the, orthogonal Devices sequencer, the 1 0 1 1 0 2 combo. Okay. And that has an SSD card on the 1 0 2. You can literally just pop a midi file on it and then load it into a snapshot on the 1 0 1, 1 0 1. And it just has your entire midi sequence there. So then you can, and it's such a seamless process, like you, you can then start taking those same notes and, and throwing it at the modular. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. So with, with the stuff that you're doing, it sounds like you're pretty adept at not only a lot of different bits of gear and bits of software, but also how to get stuff moved around back and forth. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Do you find yourself, though, in the end, gravitating towards the modular as the place where you put stuff together? Or is, or is it literally each piece ending up in a different spot in your studio? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>That's a tough, tough question. I mean, I feel the different, different tools and lots of things come into play, like time, how much time do I have? How, how long, how long do I want to give this piece? 'cause I am admittedly still faster at working in Embleton Live or Logic than I am on the modular Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I can make something and finish it much faster there, or Max for that matter, patch something up. But, you know, I do like that tactility of hardware and moving stuff around. You know, I would probably get rid of all of my modular stuff and happily just live in Max for the rest of my life. But the one thing that I love about modular is that possibility of the happy accident. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>And that phrase I use actually comes from my formal studies in photography. One of my favorite photographers is a, a German artist, Wolfgang Tillman's, who's just mind boggling. I love, I love a few different series of his works. And one was, kind of like analog darkroom experiments. And we referred to them, like, he came across this, he made this entire series of it where one day he mixed the chemicals the wrong way, Uhhuh <affirmative>, and totally messed up his photos, <laugh>, and ended up getting this amazing effect. And he did, he did an entire series based off of that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1613.025" data-end_ts="1613.445" title="1613.025" id=c_"1613.025">__caught__</span>. And he caught, like, he coined the phrase Happy accidents. Interesting. It really stuck with me. And with modular, I feel like when I, I get excited when they happen, and that's what keeps bringing me back. Like, I'll move a knob the wrong way. I didn't intend to, the muscle memory's off. Right. Or I plug a cord, I'm not paying attention and I plug a patchy in the wrong inlet, or the one I didn't intend to, but all of a sudden I'm getting in this sound that is just, lighting up my, my mind. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But beyond the happy accident thing, one of the things I've noticed in talking with people lately is that, and, and you kind of mentioned it, in a sideways way, is that sometimes people are actually finding the slowing down process to being helpful artistically. Right. So once you get really good at a tool, like something like Ableton Live, you can punch stuff out quick. Yeah. But there's something about maybe the, the, the aspect of a modular, which is like, it doesn't do anything. Right. Right. You have to patch it, you have to tweak it, you have to find the right thing. It slows down the process, and it kind of gives different parts of your mind and different parts of your body a way to affect the music that it, that doesn't happen when you're just really swiftly doing stuff <span style="color:red" data-ts="1698.405" data-end_ts="1698.605" title="1698.405" id=c_"1698.405">__with__</span> the mouse. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Yeah. That's very true. And, and I must say that on this album, there's a number of tracks that I can pinpoint where I'm like, that piece came, like that sequence. And, and all of that started, and it was probably, the track in itself was an evolution over eight or nine months. I'm not one of these guys who every Saturday morning wakes up and rips all the patch chords outta their modular <laugh>. I, I have friends who are doing, you know, some pretty phenomenal scoring work and the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1730.395" data-end_ts="1730.685" title="1730.395" id=c_"1730.395">__legs__</span> for, for different, you know, Netflix and stuff. And they have to, you know, they want it, they wanna use the modular in that as their tool set for that kind of work, but they have to regularly reconfigure. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1742.565" data-end_ts="1742.645" title="1742.565" id=c_"1742.565">__And__</span> I'm fortunate that I don't have to do that. So, you know, you, you say that, and I think I can really, I can pinpoint a piece in my life set right now that's not on the record, that I am just in love with the, the sounds and the progression, and it's inevitably gonna become a track. And it's like, what? And then I could think back that it started as like a random 15 second Instagram clip, like six months ago, <laugh>. Mm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Wow. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>And it's, yeah, I think that is really slowing down is a good point because, you know, part of my employment I to spend a lot of time in the box and it, it is nice to like, go to another part of the studio. Like my modular <span style="color:red" data-ts="1785.405" data-end_ts="1785.525" title="1785.405" id=c_"1785.405">__is__</span> away in the corner. I can't even see the computer unless I turn my head. And it's nice to just turn off and time, time changes. Yeah. It certainly tends to, go by seamlessly, that's for sure. Less distraction. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, let's talk a little bit about, the idea of a live set though, because this is one thing that for people who don't do modulars at all, it just seems like a ridiculous prospect for people who mostly do, do modulars in their studio or at home. It just seems risky, but you do it all the time. What are the things that you do to make, live performance, you know, viable? Right? Because I know, I mean, you and I both know that there are people out there doing live sets that are primarily, they look like modular sets, but they're primarily sample playback sets. Right? Right. But I know that that is not your practice. What, what do you do to make it viable? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Well, it's funny, I just had this discussion with some friends last night. First and foremost, regardless of whether I'm playing a live set out of Max or the Nor Lead or I'm on the modular, the possibility of failure needs to be there for me to be excited. I need that threat of it all going to, to shit <laugh>. Right. <laugh>, I like, it's always been the case. You know, I've been playing live now for getting close to, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1879.475" data-end_ts="1879.765" title="1879.475" id=c_"1879.475">__whoa__</span>, 15 years. It's always been the case. Like, and I, and I started in the box. I was playing live out of Ableton, but I, I literally could not just make it all be clip <span style="color:red" data-ts="1890.335" data-end_ts="1890.685" title="1890.335" id=c_"1890.335">__based__</span>. I, I would play stuff into a looper. This was like, before Ableton even had a Looper, I'd managed to make a looper using a bunch of chained simple delays, <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh no. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>And feeding, feeding them back into one another. Oh, wow. It worked really well, actually. And it was all synced because you could sink the simple delay to, clock. So it was like, you could get actually a, as a looper over a set amount of bars. But yeah, I mean, that's first for me. And then with the modular, I, it really is an instrument that I play. Like, like you can go and press the, you know, you can turn the clock on and, and different things, but nothing happens. It's like it has to be interacted with. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But I think of it like events. And I think about events a lot and certain this element happens and then this element happens and we get to an event and then we progress to the next event after that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>So a few real key modules, in my case, I have, the old Intelli Mutagen, right. Which is a six channel mixer, which you can set a, B, or C outputs, and it has a mute button. It also has CV over mute. It's such a classic module. And this still not really one in the current lineup of URAC that I know of that is in that kind of size and, functionality. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, they made a remix of it, but it's bigger. It's got sliders, does <span style="color:red" data-ts="1984.805" data-end_ts="1984.925" title="1984.805" id=c_"1984.805">__it__</span>, it's not quite the same. Right. And then I would say, the other key element is my, I use the four Ms QCD linked to the qp, LFO, and they're linked and you can actually turn, it has buttons that you can turn on and off the, the LFO function. And actually the clock controls the rate of the LFO. I use the LFO to clock stuff, and so that I can turn the LFO on and off when I wanna make events happen. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Okay. So that's how you sort of like manage bringing things in and out. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>So it gives me four different clocks that I can have physical control over. And when they come on, certain things happen, certain things don't happen. It starts a chain of events, and the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2034.885" data-end_ts="2035.165" title="2034.885" id=c_"2034.885">__legs__</span>. And then recently, I actually went ahead, this is something I've wanted for a while. Couldn't really find it, didn't wanna fill a hole in my case with such a functionalist module, but I made a little, out of a little project box, just a little, momentary gait, device. So basically I got four switches and, when I press 'em down, it, it gives a gate high. And that also allows me to interact with the MOD Modular and turn things on and off and make processes happen. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, now I've seen that you've been, you've done, modular gigs with relatively small systems. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2077.465" data-end_ts="2077.685" title="2077.465" id=c_"2077.465">__How__</span>, how do you get a variety of sounds when you have what's in essence meant to be kind of a, like if you're doing a skiff, how do you make a, how do you make a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2086.605" data-end_ts="2086.805" title="2086.605" id=c_"2086.605">__sets__</span> worth of sound out of a skiff? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>So I was doing this thing for a while where, you know, I finally, I got myself a nice 12 U travel rig and blah, blah, blah. Right. And it was going along to, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2098.265" data-end_ts="2098.485" title="2098.265" id=c_"2098.265">__to__</span> gigs and playing these sets. And they were great. I had some really great sets, but I always like, would look at it and be like, shit, you know, each time I did it, I was like, man, I'm playing a 20 minute, 40 minute set. But I realized that like in the 12 year case, that not every module was plugged in, or not every module had patch cords in it. And I was like, I don't know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2122.965" data-end_ts="2123.085" title="2122.965" id=c_"2122.965">__it__</span> just felt silly. I'm like, I dragged all this out. <laugh>, I dragged all this out here. And it's not even like completely patched up, like Right. But also, like, I felt like when I did completely patch it up in a life sense, it got to a point where it was almost automated or Right. It was either automated or it was such a bowl of multicolored spaghetti that it, it just was like, it wasn't even fun to interact with. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>What happened was, good friends Eric Cheswick and, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2156.105" data-end_ts="2156.325" title="2156.105" id=c_"2156.105">__BNA__</span> Huffer, modular on the spot asked me to play, this is literally years ago now.

</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>I'm like, I'm just going to pair it back to <span style="color:red" data-ts="2170.765" data-end_ts="2170.885" title="2170.765" id=c_"2170.765">__a__</span> little six <span style="color:red" data-ts="2171.565" data-end_ts="2171.685" title="2171.565" id=c_"2171.565">__u__</span> and I, I turned up the, the little pretty small six U 100 hp like little DDIY case I'd made. And, and Eric was like, whoa, you've, you've come down with just six U. And then I, I had such a great set, still, like a kind of highlight set. It was so fun. And, I pretty much haven't played out in more than six <span style="color:red" data-ts="2196.125" data-end_ts="2196.365" title="2196.125" id=c_"2196.125">__years__</span> since. So I, I, my case is seven UI have a row of Intelli quadrats. Oh, okay. And I also have a little, line out section that Intelli makes that allows you to mix out to a line level pedal, which I still go out to my beloved <span style="color:red" data-ts="2214.025" data-end_ts="2214.445" title="2214.025" id=c_"2214.025">__though__</span> Rat distortion pedal

</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, what other, for doing live stuff, what other things do you have external to the modular? Do you use an external reverb? Do you use a looper? Do you use external sequencers? Any of that stuff? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>No, but I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2260.285" data-end_ts="2260.445" title="2260.285" id=c_"2260.285">__have__</span> been <span style="color:red" data-ts="2260.605" data-end_ts="2260.725" title="2260.605" id=c_"2260.605">__even__</span> finalizing kind of a live set support that album and got a whole bunch of shows coming up.

<b>Darwin: </b>Now. That's, that sounds true.

You're willing to go big. Right. And the other place that I know that that's true for you is your love of cassettes and cassette technology.

And they're <span style="color:red" data-ts="2444.245" data-end_ts="2444.405" title="2444.245" id=c_"2444.245">__kind__</span>, they're fun little boxes, so I don't feel too precious about them. I'll get in there and hold my finger on the motor and manipulate the tape physically and all sorts of things like that, not feel too worried about burning stuff out. Right, right. And then I have the Tasca 4 1 4, which is kind of a classic and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2462.705" data-end_ts="2462.925" title="2462.705" id=c_"2462.705">__rea__</span> in recent times, I managed to get hold of the, like the old studio unit, the Tasca, 1, 2, 2 mark three. Yeah. Which has the kind of XL XLR in and outs and that thing's kind of, that's like tape on another level. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You know, I remember back in my studio days, I always hated dealing with cassettes because, you know, clients always wanted to take cassettes of their work home to check it out and stuff. Right. I hated them until we got that machine. It was such a solid thing. It worked perfect. It sounded great. Yeah. The other day I was kinda like sniffing around. I was like, go, oh, I could use one of those in my, in my, rack. The prices <span style="color:red" data-ts="2502.945" data-end_ts="2503.165" title="2502.945" id=c_"2502.945">__of__</span> are starting to rack up. It's kind of like crazy. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Yeah. I think if you want any of that hardware right now, it's just, just gotta jump on it right now. Yeah. 'cause the thing is they're not making them anymore and they are gonna keep going up. Like they, people were, it seems like people are reversing, they're less concerned with fidelity. There was a real, you know, everyone was so like, oh, it must be 24 bit, it must be 96 K. Right. It's, you're not even playing ball if it's not. Like people are less concerned with it right now. And I think that's gonna stay around for a while. I mean, you know, we've reached that point with technology and DSP where yeah, we can have pristine for days, you know, but it's sometimes more interesting to introduce, you know, flaws and character and, and the unexpected can happen with tape 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And Yeah. And indeed, well also it kind of has that life. So again, when I hear some of your stuff that's droner or like the cinematic stuff, I think in addition to all the other modulations that you're making, it also seems like there's just like the imperfections of tape and stuff like that just add to the quality of that. It, it makes it so those things are more enjoyable to listen to. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>It's very true. In fact, I, when I got a copy of the cassette of the album and listened, you know, I hadn't, I hadn't done this. I sent the Masters off digitally to the, to the label, and I got the cassette and I, I was like, well, I should play it to see what it sounds like. Right. And certainly there was definitely new cha, like I knew the tracks so well. I spent so much time with <span style="color:red" data-ts="2603.605" data-end_ts="2603.765" title="2603.605" id=c_"2603.605">__them__</span> before they got sent off, and I was kind of surprised in a good way, the, the kind of nuances and character that it had been brought to the party just by putting it onto cassette. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Yeah, I, yeah, I mean, I'm pretty, I'm interested in that DIY quality of playing around with that kind of element. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Well, Tom, I can't believe it, but our time is already pegged here. Yeah. But before I let you go, I'm curious, you've got this release coming out, which I'm sure once it's, once it's out there, you're gonna want to take a nap. But then when you wake up, what's next on the horizon for you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Yeah, so, really just wanting to get out there and, and I kind of have had live shows on hold a little bit. The start of this year. It's been pretty busy with a whole bunch of different projects on the boil. And I'm quite, quite excited because I feel like this is like a definitive moment. I haven't had a release since like 2013 or something. So it's really nice to have something that's, you know, gonna go out there that I'm, I feel like it's got resolve. It's, an extension of where I'm at right now creatively. So I'm gonna follow that up with a bunch of live shows. And I'm playing in New York on, June 2nd at Outpost re outpost Artist Resources, as part of a festival called Confetti Machine, which is pretty amazing name for a festival. It's pretty great. And it's kind of a multimedia, realtime arts, sound noise. It's really a hybrid festival, so it's kind of like perfect spot for me, actually, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Unfortunately, that when people hear this, that will have been yesterday. But <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>But yeah, la album launch shows in the works for Los Angeles. It's not wrapped up <span style="color:red" data-ts="2724.985" data-end_ts="2725.205" title="2724.985" id=c_"2724.985">__yet__</span>, but I've kind of like got things at a point now, both with my live visuals, which I make in Max, where I'm really kind of wanting to just get these kind of more, and I feel like I, these things need to be on a larger scale, so I'm like trying to get them into bigger venues. That's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Fantastic. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>And make it kind of more, immersive, sonically and visually for the audience. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, frankly, I wish we had had time to talk more about the visual end on this, because this is something that's becoming a growing part of the, of what people are expecting when they go to a gig, but we'll have to save that for the next time we talk. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>We'll come back around another indeed, four years of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2768.545" data-end_ts="2768.765" title="2768.545" id=c_"2768.545">__the__</span> <laugh>. We'll see where we're at. Well 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Hope, hopefully it's sooner than that, <laugh>, but hey man, I want to thank you so much for taking the time again, this was a lot of fun and it was always, as always, great to catch up and hear how you're doing, what you're doing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Likewise. Thanks for having me, Darwin. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2782.845" data-end_ts="2783.245" title="2782.845" id=c_"2782.845">__Alright__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Many thanks to Tom Hall for hanging out and talking smart about, about his work. Particularly this new release called Spectra. It's gonna be out on <span style="color:red" data-ts="2800.805" data-end_ts="2801.125" title="2800.805" id=c_"2800.805">__Ellie__</span> Media, E-L-L-I-M-E-D-I-A. The release number is E <span style="color:red" data-ts="2806.585" data-end_ts="2806.805" title="2806.585" id=c_"2806.585">__oh__</span> six and, it's gonna be released on June 5th, 2018. I've gotten a chance to hear an early version of it, and it really, I found it quite stunning to me. It's in addition to being from Tom, a good friend of mine, it's just clearly one of the releases of the year. It's fantastic. He's already getting a lot of attention for it. So do yourself a favor and check it out. It's worth learning about. Beyond that, I want to thank you, the listeners for showing up again, our numbers have been fantastic. We're getting listenership that I never would've thought possible. But as always, I would ask that if you could reach out on whatever platform you normally listen on, whether it's iTunes, Stitcher, if it's YouTube or Spotify, whatever. If there's a way for you to give it a thumbs up or a like, or a big smiley face of some sort, if you could do that, that'd be greatly appreciated. Thanks all to all the friends out there that are helping this thing spread. People like opia, my friends at cycling, and, other places like that. Super helpful. I really appreciate it. But then I'm gonna let you go. Catch you next time around. Bye.
