<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today I have, a very special treat. We are going to have our first three timer on the podcast. He, he's been on twice before. His name's Gregory Taylor I'm sure you know him. He's one of my best friends. He's a performer with me in, a number of different environments and groups. But he also has some unique, background and <span style="color:red" data-ts="36.565" data-end_ts="36.805" title="36.565" id=c_"36.565">__some__</span> unique things that he does that I want to delve into a little bit more. And, in this case, what we're gonna do is we're going to dive in a little bit onto his experiences being a radio broadcaster. He's run the same radio show on WRT, for going on 30 years. Is that right, Gregory? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory Taylor : </b>Yeah, pretty much. There's, I think maybe two hiatus where my wife got a Fulbright or a sabbatical and I went abroad. But apart from that, <span style="color:red" data-ts="68.625" data-end_ts="68.845" title="68.625" id=c_"68.625">__yes__</span>. Since about 1986 or 19 85, 19 86. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>One of the reasons I wanted to talk to you about it is because an awful lot of has changed in the musical environment between, then and now. And so what I'd like to do is, first of all, I think people that, imagine being a radio star as being kind of a cool thing. Why don't you tell us a little bit about how you got started? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Sure. Well, for one thing, it's not something, that I ever intended to do. In fact, prior to my arrival in Madison, I think the sum total of my radio experience involved, locking myself out of a student radio station while the second side of there was an old Poco record that had like a whole side of stuff. And I went to get a Coke and locked myself outta the station, and it ran the runoff lock groove for four hours because I couldn't get janitors to unlock the station. That was my beginning broadcasting thing, and it's pretty ignominious. When I moved to Madison, Wisconsin, after my wife got her, got her first academic job, I was pretty well ensconced in what we would think of as cassette culture. In fact, we've, we talked a little bit about that and I, I think the first time that you and I talked maybe. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Yep. So I had a collection of work with me and I found out that we had a community radio station in town, that's a little bit different than public radio. And if you like, we can maybe go into the difference. But basically the idea was I thought, oh, cool, there's a radio station in town. Maybe I'll take some things down and maybe they'll play my music on the air. That'd be awesome. 'cause I'd had a little, I'd gotten some airplay, particularly WNYC in New York. John Schaefer had been very kind to me in a lot during the eighties. And, so I took some down to the station and, dropped them off. Said hello to the, woman who was then the music director. Gave her a bunch of things, and she said, you know, I'll be glad to listen to these and, give you a call in a while. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>I thought Great. Went home and everything was fine. And she called me up a couple of weeks later and asked me to come down to the station. And yeah, I wasn't really sure what was going on, but I went down anyway. And we talked about the work and she said, you know, this is really interesting. It's really fun. We've got a couple of shows that this would be really interesting for. And I discovered in the course of that conversation that she wasn't actually as the music director. She wasn't telling people what to play. What she was basically doing was being kind of a gatekeeper and passing stuff along to people who either would or wouldn't decide to play it, which was a little bit of a surpri. That was something I really wasn't aware of doing. But the thing that she really said was she kind of, you know, poured me a, poured me a glass of wine down in her office downstairs, and pushed back from the, the table for a little bit and said, but, you know, I wanted to know if you'd be interested, if you ever thought of doing a radio program. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>And I said, no, actually, I never thought about doing that. And she said, well, would you be willing to consider, do, do you think you could do like a, a couple of hours worth of radio? And I said, well, do I have to talk a lot or anything like that? And she just, this was kind of a mystifying answer, but she said, you can do whatever you like, <laugh>. It's two hours. Just don't, Sandy the seven bad words, and you can play anything you want. Do you think you could do a two hour show? And I said something like, yeah, I guess I could do one, maybe. And she said, oh, great. Because basically what had happened was they were in a situation where there was a person that did a great experimental show. I'd listened to him already, actually, since I got in town. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Bill Milas, the show is called System Considerations. It was <span style="color:red" data-ts="297.315" data-end_ts="297.605" title="297.315" id=c_"297.315">__Miss__</span> Magnificent Experimental Radio Program. And, bill, of course had to be away once in a while. He'd be sick, he'd be on vacation. So the question was, could I do that? So I said, you, I can only do one show. And, the music director said, okay, that's all you need, just one show. And then when you finish doing the one show, think about doing another one. So I went home and I puzzled, and I sweated, and I just laugh now to think about how hard I worked on it. The very first <span style="color:red" data-ts="323.915" data-end_ts="324.205" title="323.915" id=c_"323.915">__rate__</span>, I can tell you what the first show I did was, the first show I did was dedicated entirely to music released on Brian Eno's obscure music label <laugh>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="335.535" data-end_ts="335.885" title="335.535" id=c_"335.535">__which__</span> I thought that would be like a total winner. So I just, I just agonized over like what pieces to choose and what order to put stuff in. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>And that was my first show. And, the first time I went in, in those days, you had to be, there was a certification process to basically run the board and be on the air and stuff. So I had someone do that for me. And all I did was just blabbed. I thought I talked way too much, but, the woman that ran the station called me back and said, that was wonderful. I think you should think about doing another show now. So I went home and I agonized over, I think it was a show composed entirely of women because we are coming up on Women's History Month or something like that. And I thought, maybe he'll be away that month. But anyway, so, and that's how it started. So when, those of you out there listening think about the idea of doing radio for somewhere between 20 and 30 years, please don't think of it as doing something for 20 or 30 years. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Think of it, in the way that you think of making your own work. You do one piece after another and you concentrate on the piece that's in front of you. And after enough time you've been on the radio for so long that it's really frightening. And that's kind of, that's how it started. At some point they decided they wanted to do, there was, there was an issue with, the programming that came directly before the show being a sort of like a world music show back before world music meant Global pop. And, there were three different programmers because this is community radio. So the programmers are all volunteers, and they play the things that they love. And then, Bill's show would be, you know, more conceptually rigorous stuff. And, and they looked at the Arbitron and realized that people would like either turn off the radio at 8 0 1 or they'd turn it on at 7 59. And the person who was then the music director said, well, there's gonna be a whole opening up in a couple of weeks. And we were wondering if you'd think about doing a show that would like start out, kind of nice, like the world music shows are, and then get creepy and weary and scary and weird at the end of two hours. Could you do that <laugh>? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>So suddenly I didn't have a challenge to have any, I had, I didn't have to have good ideas for show content. Right. All I had to do was to go from nice to creepy and scary. And, I said, well, yeah, I guess I could do that. And then, that's how my show was born. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. And, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Yeah, and there's some other issues. I mean, in those days, everybody on the station had cool on air names. Right? Right. And I couldn't think of any names for myself that didn't sound stupid. Mongo, king of the Universe, just that sort of stuff. And I also couldn't think of any good names for the show that wouldn't sound totally stupid Uhhuh. So, I, I would, my first decision was I'm just gonna use my first name, the short version of my fir just Greg. That's all I'm gonna be, not gonna make any bones about being anybody I'm not. And I still couldn't think of the name of the show. So I got up my o oblique strategies deck, and I shuffled the cards and the first card I drew, and boy, I still think about this, the first card I drew said, remember those quiet evenings? Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>That's R-T-Q-E-R-T-Q-E. And I thought, you know, that's kind of what I think the show should maybe be about is some, you know, it's Sunday night, so people are trying to not think about the coming work day. They've put their kids to bed, they have a chance to just sort of sit back and do something other than worry. So I thought, oh, this is a perfect name for the show. And of course it's the ni it it, but it was too long just saying, saying, remember those quiet evening <span style="color:red" data-ts="559.275" data-end_ts="559.565" title="559.275" id=c_"559.275">__laws__</span> all the time in the middle of something when you met a radio show was really complicated. But this was the 1980s, so everything was an acronym, so it turned into RTQE and it has been that ever since. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>That's how I got started. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So now you talk about this being community radio. Could you explain what the difference is between community radio and pub and what we normally think of as public radio? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Oh, sure. And this is probably gonna be, a little bit, confusing for anybody listening who's not American. Okay. Community radio is differs from public radio in terms of its funding structure. For one thing. We don't get nearly as much money from the government, which has actually meant that we are, we haven't fallen on quite as serious a hard times as, the federal government cutbacks for public radio have been, although there's still some trouble. All the money you get from the government is a block grant based on the amount of money you raise already. And you can only use that money for things like full-time staff positions. So one of the big differences between community radio and public radio is that community radio is overwhelmingly driven by volunteers. And so what that pretty much means is that you have to raise, you know, one or $2 million less a year. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>'cause you're not paying programmers on the other half. I'm not a, I'm not a paid professional, nor have I been one for a very long time. Public radio is more, large blocks of programming. And, and after, various political factions in the United States decided to go after public radio for its perceived liberalism, they've had to raise more money for things, related to, let's say, programming and stuff like that. Whereas, you know, my station has a staff that's, cut to the bone. I mean, there's, there's really, there's really nothing more than a really competent, really dedicated staff that keeps the transmitters on and things like that. And the rest of us, do the work because we love it. And I suppose I would say that, that there's, there's certainly a political component to that. The earliest community radio stations in the United, in the United States were havens for left leftist politics, kp, KPFK, and, and k you know, those stations out on the West Coast we're direct descendants from that particular style of radio. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Yeah. So that's kind of the big difference is that, community radio is volunteer driven, and that also means that we don't have, so things like programmers are really different. The programmers at our station never tell any of us what to play. What they do is wrangle data for, companies that provide us with promos and things like that. And they report playback and stuff like that. And with the Digital <span style="color:red" data-ts="729.865" data-end_ts="730.285" title="729.865" id=c_"729.865">__Mining__</span> Copyright Act, there's a few other things they have to do, but it's entirely volunteerer driven, which means one of the reasons I guess I stay is nobody's told me I have to leave 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>I've continued to raise, you know, I've continued to raise money. When we have to do fund, we do it like three times a year. Right. But basically, that's it. I, every Sunday is a blank page. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="756.305" data-end_ts="756.525" title="756.305" id=c_"756.305">__You__</span> go in and say, what do I do this 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Week? Yeah. So when you raise money that literally goes to the radio station, you don't get any of it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Oh, not a cent. No, no, no, no, <span style="color:red" data-ts="764.805" data-end_ts="764.965" title="764.805" id=c_"764.805">__no__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>All right. Well, so then the question is, especially for people who are like myself, who are terminally behind <laugh> paying bills, <laugh>, why, what is the motivation for continuing to do it? I mean, it's nice to say good question that I like doing it because nobody tells me what to do. But that's good for about three weeks of work. I <span style="color:red" data-ts="791.205" data-end_ts="791.285" title="791.205" id=c_"791.205">__am__</span> Yeah, that's true. I'm wondering what gets you going for 30 years worth? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="797.855" data-end_ts="797.975" title="797.855" id=c_"797.855">__Hmm__</span>. Well, I suppose it would sound, it might sound a little bit silly, but I think one of the things that keeps me doing it, I would say there are two things. The first one is more, how do I say ego <span style="color:red" data-ts="813.575" data-end_ts="813.775" title="813.575" id=c_"813.575">__driven__</span>? I'm not sure what the word I want is, but, but basically doing the program has provi has forced me to have to continue to listen. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>You know, sometimes you, sometimes when you do work, you set goals for yourself or you, you create games for yourself whose outcome is supposed to be some desired goal. In my case, it's kept me having to listen to stuff to, to greater or lesser extents. It's also forced me to listen to people whose work I respect more than I like. Oh. Because since the radio station is, since listener, sponsors keep us on the air, listener sponsors are people that you listen to. So <span style="color:red" data-ts="859.135" data-end_ts="859.355" title="859.135" id=c_"859.135">__it__</span>, because you form <span style="color:red" data-ts="861.075" data-end_ts="861.195" title="861.075" id=c_"861.075">__a__</span>, you actually form relationships with them. <span style="color:red" data-ts="862.985" data-end_ts="863.275" title="862.985" id=c_"862.985">__Sure__</span>. One of the things about the way my show has changed is I really don't talk on the air very much now because everybody is accustomed to the idea that they can call into the station and tell me what I'm doing wrong, ask me <laugh> about the record that I've done. Right. My relationships have switched to these, telephone things. Right. To my considerable surprise. 'cause I used to have to play longer pieces when I was on the air 15 or 20 years ago, because if I played something people liked, I'd have to be on the phone at the same time I was announcing. Right. Because there's no one else in the <span style="color:red" data-ts="893.485" data-end_ts="893.645" title="893.485" id=c_"893.485">__st__</span> It's Sunday night, there's no one else in the station. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Of course. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>The other thing about it though, and this sounds a little more highfalutin than uncomfortable being, but I would say that as a listener, when I think about, when I think about the way that new things entered my life, a lot of it is tied up with, personal relationships, A very certain kind of, it, a personal relationship with somebody who knew more than I did. And, and when faced with somebody who was as sure of themselves and full of themselves as I was when I was younger, instead of just deciding that I was a little idiot and I wasn't worth spending time with, I was surrounded by people who widened my universe by trying to explain to me why the things that I disliked or didn't know anything about mattered. And when I think about the person that I've become, I owe them a tremendous debt to the extent that I'm still in touch with them. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>And, and now, actually, now that I'm older, to the extent that they're still alive, I tell them that every single time that I talk to them. And there are some of them that I can't pay back anymore. And I see some of what I do. I think of it as paying it forward, finding something for somebody that they've never heard before. Because I, that visceral excitement of that is something that you, once you have the experience of it yourself, you wanna give it to other people, you just do. Sure. Because it's a great, it's a great experience. Period. That's, so, that's probably, that's, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That's, it's, it's cool that you say that because certainly one of the reasons that I tune into your show, and I, I listen to the streaming version of it often, one of the reasons that I listen to it is because so often I'll be introduced to things, either things that I've heard of and I am curious about, you know, I guess I could go on Spotify, but there's, there's sort of this thing that's like, I've heard of it, but I wasn't compelled to search it out. Right. Mm-Hmm. And then when all of a sudden you provide it to me, I'm like, oh, that's really cooler. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1028.915" data-end_ts="1029.135" title="1028.915" id=c_"1028.915">__Oh__</span>, I really hate that. Or, ah, I would, you know, that sounds like me on a good day or on a bad day, or on a day. Well, that was 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Something, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, exactly. <laugh>. But, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>One of the things about doing my program that has changed, and it took me a long time to realize why I'd done what I did, but I just, it, it seemed like a habit at first is with a, with a couple of exceptions, I generally never tell people what I'm about to play. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Hmm. That tends to come earlier. What I've basically kind of discovered was that, often if you tell people what to play, their expectations will be more fixed. There'll be less of a sense of surprise. And in some cases, you can have that great call where you play something for someone and they say, you know, they'll call you up and say, well, this is awesome. What's this? And you'll say, it's John Cage. And then they'll just, without even thinking about, they'll say, but I hate John Cage <laugh>. And you'll say, you don't now do you? Right. That's, I mean, that, that's kind of sneaky, but it's, it's actually a lot of fun. Or the more recent one for me has been, there's been a, there's recently been a real spate of, reissues of very old electronic tape music from really from all over the world. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>We're from the fifties, sixties, and seventies, for reasons I have yet to fully understand. High school kids love it. <laugh>. That's when I talk, I have no idea why. That's, when I talk to high school kids, you especially, oh, mono, if it's mono, oh man, they love that. And they'll call up and say, wow, this is really great. What is this? And you can just, you can just sort of like, hear the enthusiasm and then you slowly work around to telling them that the person that did this piece of music could have dated their grandmother. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>You know, and it's, I just, wow. I'm sorry. I take such delight in that idea that, that what is, what is new, you know, a consequence of the internet being this giant source of music is what is new, is not what is temporally novel anymore. Right. And exploiting that is, is great fun. And by not telling people ahead of time, you, you sort of maximize that. And, and, well, since I'm in charge of the show, I get to, I get to do it that way. There's a few exceptions to that rule. Well, also, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, has a couple of provisions for webcasting that have made the, that have made the transition from broadcasting to webcasting annoying. One of those, one of those rules is you're not supposed to tell, you can't post a playlist ahead of time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Yeah. Okay. So if I post, if I, when I post, I have a mailing list, when I post <span style="color:red" data-ts="1194.045" data-end_ts="1194.165" title="1194.045" id=c_"1194.045">__a__</span> my Facebook page about what's gonna be on the, on the air, I have to do it in alphabetical order. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, interesting. Wow. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>'cause you can tell people what to expect without telling them when you're going to play it. Right. And it's just the DMCA is, it's got some really stupid rules that's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1211.005" data-end_ts="1211.285" title="1211.005" id=c_"1211.005">__really__</span> crazy. But you <span style="color:red" data-ts="1211.685" data-end_ts="1211.805" title="1211.685" id=c_"1211.685">__don't__</span>, you know, but it, it doesn't bother me that much. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So one of the things that you said, about naming your broadcast was that, you know, you were thinking, ah, it's a great name because, you know, people are putting their kids to bed. But then you also, I mean, you hook me and generally, I don't care what my kids are doing, <laugh>. And, but you also talk <span style="color:red" data-ts="1235.605" data-end_ts="1235.885" title="1235.605" id=c_"1235.605">__about__</span> having young people calling you, and what is your audience? I mean, what's your actual audience versus what you thought they might be? And because it sounds like you interact with them a lot more than I would've expected. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Oh, I, you do. That's a, that's a consequence of community radio generally, is the sense that if you have a community station in town, listener sponsors are accustomed to the idea that they have their stakeholders or they have something to say about what they're doing, and they also, have that privilege outside of the work that they listen to. Right. So, you know, so I'll occasionally get like, a somebody who listens to the Dusty Storm bluegrass show call up and complain about something or, or be impressed about something. So the idea is you, you really have to make a, a count of yourself. I know I have, I know I have high school kids, and the reason I know that I have high school kids is without fail. I mean, it's really interesting. Every kind of, end of the summer, I'll get a couple of calls from people whose voices I don't recognize. I don't know their name, I don't remember them from listener sponsor roles. And they'll call up and say, hi, this is, this is, Darren. And, I'm going off to school in, I'm going to Columbia in the fall, and, gotta leave town. And I just wanted to know, let you know that, like, I've listened to your show since I was in about eighth grade. 'cause my dad used to have it on all the time. And, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>I just wanted you to know that, thanks. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Wow.

<b>Gregory: </b>Which is of course, always like, it just pierces you through the heart. Right. Of course. The other one that's really interesting is older listeners, who are, I didn't, you know, I thought everything the kids were doing today is crap. This is great. This sounds like <span style="color:red" data-ts="1356.975" data-end_ts="1357.095" title="1356.975" id=c_"1356.975">__a__</span> silver <span style="color:red" data-ts="1357.365" data-end_ts="1357.655" title="1357.365" id=c_"1357.365">__mess__</span>. I played, a Norwegian band called Elephant Nine who do some work with, Rainer Fisk, who's, dun Y's guitar player. This, it's sort of great instrumental Prague. And I had this guy called, who's so happy that, you know, modern Prague stuff <span style="color:red" data-ts="1373.695" data-end_ts="1373.815" title="1373.695" id=c_"1373.695">__that__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1373.815" data-end_ts="1373.975" title="1373.815" id=c_"1373.815">__is__</span> all that metal crap. And I can't believe <span style="color:red" data-ts="1376.375" data-end_ts="1376.575" title="1376.375" id=c_"1376.375">__our__</span> still great stuff being done. And I was like, dude, this just came out. He was so happy. So I know I have really young and really old listeners. I also know I have parents as listeners. Again, this is, this is, this is not scientific demographics. These are just people I know. I know. I have parents because if I play something and someone's child falls asleep to it, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Seriously, I get called. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You get, oh, I thought it was great. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1403.295" data-end_ts="1403.575" title="1403.295" id=c_"1403.295">__Really__</span>. Like, you get endless requests for that same piece then 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b><laugh> Oh, oh, oh, that, oh, believe me. Believe me. That too. I totally do. And I think part of my audience, I think part of my audience only listens to half my show. I think that I have an audience that, turns the show on after they put their kids to bed. So I'm nine to 11 o'clock. So I think I have an audience that turns on the radio at 10 o'clock. 'cause the listener sponsor thing goes up after that. And I also think there are people who have it on for the first hour. So if I play anything like really loud and scratchy and scary at the beginning of the show, I'll hear about it because someone will call me up and say, oh, yeah. You know, Ashley is just like running a house in tight little circles now. 'cause that thing just whipped her into a frenzy. Thanks a lot, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>So, and, and I appear to meet my, I appear to meet my fundraising goals. So I know <span style="color:red" data-ts="1458.435" data-end_ts="1458.725" title="1458.435" id=c_"1458.435">__that__</span>, and I know that there are people who've listened to the program and supported it, for years and years and years. There are names that I certainly recognize. Yeah. And occasionally, you know, I'll notice that one of them dies or something like that. Mm-Hmm. But, by virtue <span style="color:red" data-ts="1475.405" data-end_ts="1475.605" title="1475.405" id=c_"1475.405">__of__</span> the fact that my contact with my audience is just by, you know, they, unless they call me, I don't know who they are. I also have, noticed that I've begun getting pledges for on-air fundraising for people who do not live in our broadcast area. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>San Francisco, I have a, I have a faithful listener, in Australia who apparently, who I believe listened to my program when I was, when he was in the United States and, now grades, papers on Monday morning in Australia listening to my show. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, wow. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Which I think is kind of cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's wild. That is very cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>I mean, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1512.405" data-end_ts="1512.605" title="1512.405" id=c_"1512.405">__that__</span>, you know, I guess I should be making crap loads of money and, and spending my evenings in the champagne room. But you know what, that's really satisfying to me personally. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, but it also brings up a point because as you suggest, the internet, the existence of the internet, the availability of music, all of all of that, really, that's changed a lot of stuff. And I mean, first of all, it obviously changes. It allows me to be a listener to your radio station, even though I'm a thousand miles away, or someone in Australia who's 5,000 miles away. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Yeah. But 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Also, absolutely, it change, it probably changes where you are able to get, content from where you're finding music to put on your show. Hmm. And also, it has most definitely changed the way that music is being released and the way that you see labels coming and going, all that kind of stuff. Why don't, why don't you fill me in a little bit on the effects that you see from the music side? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Well, anytime you talk about what's happened about, the time over which I broadcast, one of the most obvious and largest changes is the move to webcasting. Now again, listener sponsored radio is really different. We actually had a lot of heartfelt discussions at our station about webcasting because we identified ourselves as local strongly glocal. And the feeling on the part of some people who were at the station at the time was that, if we webcast suddenly everyone would want to be international stars, and we would lose our interest in a local engagement. Hmm. So that it was a really, it was a really serious, heartfelt discussion. So I'm, I'm trying to present the station as the kind of group of people who think about things in that way. They're really interested in, in, in being invested as where they are. That said, it would also be a matter of talking about the rise of what, I guess I would consider to be narrow casting rather than broadcasting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>The notion that, particularly with arrival of various kinds of satellite radio, we have, thousands and thousands of stations that broadcast, within very narrow ranges. Now, there, it's not the same. It's not quite the same dynamic as you find with commercial radio. Commercial, you know, for commercial radio music is sort of, inter commercial lubricant. It gets people to kind of like leave the radio on until the next ad comes along. Right. So if you play something that's too far away, they might turn the radio off and that would be bad. Narrow casting is a little bit different in the sense that you don't wanna lose your audience, but at the same time, you're encouraged to greater and greater degrees to, work within a specific genre. So you'll have like the dubstep serious channel or the, the bluegrass serious channel. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Those are not bad things. In fact, actually, I've, I listened to the all of them. I even <span style="color:red" data-ts="1703.325" data-end_ts="1703.405" title="1703.325" id=c_"1703.325">__listened__</span> to the online Gregorian chant, channel <laugh> that my friend Brad Garten turned me onto. There's another one that's all <span style="color:red" data-ts="1709.925" data-end_ts="1710.205" title="1709.925" id=c_"1709.925">__bird__</span> songs, you know, so that's kind of great. It's got its place. But I see what I'm involved in doing as different than the narrow casting stuff. In fact, I'm kind of the opposite. I see a lot of what I'm supposed to do as finding, an ex an accessible exemplar of something that points people to, the opportunity to find out about something outside of that. So I feel like my job is to point at specialists, and I came to that over a long period of time because I was trying to find a good rationalization for the fact that I, I felt anxious about, oh, I don't know, this would've been about 10 years into broadcasting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>I suddenly said, oh, this is terrible. I'm only playing things I like, like, oh man, this is like really terrible. These poor people are stuck listening to me playing my 10 favorite records. Of course it wasn't 10, but the idea was I wanted to, kind of work outside of that. And I wound up deciding that what I was gonna try to do was to sort of program by <span style="color:red" data-ts="1776.745" data-end_ts="1777.165" title="1776.745" id=c_"1776.745">__tamber__</span>, but something like that. I wanted to find some, i some kind of loose idea that that wasn't <span style="color:red" data-ts="1784.745" data-end_ts="1784.965" title="1784.745" id=c_"1784.745">__ge__</span> necessarily genre based around which to organize a program so that you could wander back and forth between forms without particularly upsetting people. I have a young woman now who listens to my show, who's been on my case about this thing recently, and I'm, I've really been thinking about this the last couple of months. Chia has said, I really love your show, but you know, there's no people in it. And I thought, well, wait a second. It's full of people <laugh>. And I think what she meant was there are not a lot of singers. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Right. It's, it's what I think it's the, the terrain is not organized by genre, but pe but the human voice is not at the forefront of what I do. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I never thought of that particular semiotic as being involved with being no people. Right. But I do think, what I do think the thing that she does correctly Intuit, is that I'm trying to make a sort of space for listening that's not homogenous, but sort of has some sense of, of movement about it. So I would say that micro casting has been, an arrival that's been kind of good for me, because that's the thing you get to, to point to. I don't play dubstep, but if I did, I would find the best piece of dubstep I could. And every time somebody called me in and called in and said, this is great, I'd say, okay, this is called dubstep. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Go look for it. Oh, in fact, there was a, there was a British band called, bark Psychosis, one of the great nineties British sort of quasi shoegazer bands that when that band split up, one of the guys in the band started doing drum and bass under the name Boomerang. And it was awesome drum. It was really good drum and bass. And that was what I would do with that thing. I didn't play a lot of drum and bass, but when I did, or you know, maybe Rome or something, when I did, I, people would call up and I'd say, that's called drum <span style="color:red" data-ts="1899.205" data-end_ts="1899.325" title="1899.205" id=c_"1899.205">__and__</span> bass. That's a whole genre. There's, there's hours and months worth of listening to this stuff. Go get 'em. Or you could do the same thing with computer music. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So the one question I have about that though, and, and it goes back to something you said earlier, you, you made the statement that you like to treat radio shows like music or art pieces. Right. You kind of, you kind of develop them in that way. And I've kind of talked to you and you've been in the middle of putting a show together, and I've kind of heard that happen. I'm curious how you, how do you balance things when, if, if that's one of your goals? Part of it then is to sort of like, have a voice. Right. Have a voice that people know when they hear you, that it's you. I mean, one of the worst things you can do as a musician is to be able to play all music, right? Yeah. I mean, it's nice to be able to, but you don't want to do it, you know, <laugh>, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Yep. Absolutely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And so similarly with a radio show like yours, I mean, how, how do you balance saying, here are my personal choice? I mean, you touched on it here a second ago, but how do you develop newness and, and newness for yourself as well as for your listeners, while at the same time maintaining that voice that hopefully people are going to use to, determine if they're going <span style="color:red" data-ts="1979.525" data-end_ts="1979.645" title="1979.525" id=c_"1979.525">__to__</span> be a avid listener? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Well, doing, doing new stuff does affect your staus as a trusted agent. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>That's true. It, at some point I started attempting to play, let me think if I can think of a, of a, of a classic example where my deciding to include more of something really upset someone. Oh, yeah. I know. Exactly. Okay. So at some point, I started, I, I was looking at a lot more, what you'd think of as procedural composition. There's a period of time in the, in the sixties when that's, a very big deal. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Explain that a little bit more what that means. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Procedural composition is something that was fairly fashionable in the 1960s. There are still people who do it, but that's really when it started in earnest where, to generate a piece, you basically des you basically describe a series of actions, or you set up a structure, or the thing that you work from to create the structure of the piece would be graphic material rather than specified notes. Okay. So I decided I was gonna do more of that stuff, and that led me back to a lot of really early Morton Feldman. And of course, once you play early Morton Feldman, you really want people to hear the, the work he did toward the end of his life. Unfortunately, since so much of that is three hours long, you, you have a sort of limited set. But, so I started working on this stuff, and there was a, there was a woman who was one of my listeners. I presume she was a grad student because she's gone now, but she had the most un airing ability to identify Morton Feldman of any human I've ever encountered. And she, and, and here's the thing, she hated Morton Feldman 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Oh, yeah. And it would be, and the call for the call that I would get from her would, would be, proceeded by something like, oh, sweet Jesus. This is that Morton Feldman stuff again, isn't 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It <laugh>? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>And, and it got to the point where I would like try to find stuff that I could fool her with. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2102.305" data-end_ts="2102.525" title="2102.305" id=c_"2102.305">__You__</span> know, I'd find unusual versions of Fort Feldman's graphic scores, or he wrote this really quiet percussion piece called The King of Denmark. There's a bunch of recordings of that, and I try to sneak a new one on. She could find it. So sometimes you do that, but more often than not, I guess I tend to think that I sort of listen, I kind of listen in a straight line. And I think that it's possible that there are, that the jumps occur because somebody aims me at something that I didn't know about. And let me, while I'm just talking idly, I'll try to think of an example of that. But by and large, I tend to trust the people that I listen to. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>And when individual work winds up kind of collecting other works around it as a genre, I tend to listen to that. So, an example of that would say be Chris Watson's, work using site recordings of sound. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, his stuff is, and so I guess we'd also talk about Bernie Kraus, right? Used to be in Beaver and Kraus back in the old days. They've become, recordists of the natural world. And they basically make pieces that, will do things like compressing it the audio scape of an entire day. Or in the case of, Chris Watson's really powerful work do things like, here's what the island upon which an Irish monk <span style="color:red" data-ts="2186.625" data-end_ts="2186.845" title="2186.625" id=c_"2186.625">__St__</span>. Cuthbert lived in the nth century would sound like. That stuff is 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Just really compelling. And sooner or later that goes, that bleeds into a genre. So now we have, say, pornography, right, right. Which is people who basically construct pieces out of those site recordings. And now actually, that stuff has worked its way into kind of, there's this new newer kind of chamber ambient that we associate with a very specific set of labels. And it'll, it'll pretty much be like watery pianos. They'll almost certainly be a cello synth pads, and, site recordings, recording recordings. Yeah. The site recordings that are eqd. So they sound like they're being played on, a cylinder recorder. Right. And that's like the genre. So I, I am interested in the way that that stuff kind of moves and modifies. And I think that's one of the reasons where playing new stuff isn't really that complicated. Or since you program by Timur, the certain, certain kinds of acoustic space will be similar. Right. So if you program something, a new release from say, swell Records, it's a great label. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> Swell Records has no reverb. The stuff is just like flat. It's sitting right on the surface of the speaker. That's part of, I I would say that's part of its aesthetic. But you don't do that and then play, a live recording from the Royal Palace at Muni <span style="color:red" data-ts="2281.005" data-end_ts="2281.125" title="2281.005" id=c_"2281.005">__Gar__</span> on in Indonesia, because it's gonna be big and wet and full of, it's a 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Big <span style="color:red" data-ts="2285.885" data-end_ts="2286.045" title="2285.885" id=c_"2285.885">__clash__</span>, right? Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Yeah. Exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So now one, one question I have is, you've just mentioned labels a couple of times. It used to be that for me, and quite frankly still is that I use labels as references for further things I like, so I got into, Alden Novo, and, then, you know, that introduced me to the Ton label, which I love everything they do. Right, you bet. And so that's just a, a peculiar, instance of a label serving as a, as an introducer of stuff. Is that still how you do it? Or do you, or have you found other means by which you get clued into stuff? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Oh, good question. I would say that there are, well, maybe books is a better way to put it. There are authors that I buy in hardback, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>When the book comes out, it's, it's on my desk. Either the day it comes out, or whenever, Amazon or Powell sends it to my house. There are, there are artisan labels that I do that, that I do that to absolutely positively true. One of the things, I guess if we're thinking about change over time, one of the things that's really changed has been, what I guess I would think of as curatorial positions more than anything else. So one of the changes, from the middle 1980s to the middle 1990s, that has to do with this idea of curatorial stuff, was the death of the new music distribution service. It was a clearing house for a whole lot of individual po individual people. I dealt with them myself as an individual person. So they sort of collected stuff. And although they were all over the map, and maybe that was one of their financial difficulties, they were a trusted source of curation. So if you're looking for cool, weird stuff, you would go to the NMDS catalog and just go through and try to find stuff there. When that went away, it took a long time, for things to settle. So I think in that interim, I got used to the idea of, trusting labels. Okay. That curatorial association. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. There are labels that are strongly curatorial. ECM obviously being one of the big ones. Right. But <span style="color:red" data-ts="2426.955" data-end_ts="2427.115" title="2426.955" id=c_"2426.955">__there__</span> also places they were 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Kind of the first, first one that I actually thought of in that way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Yeah. I think in some, one of the other contemporary ones we could think of would be the Nun <span style="color:red" data-ts="2435.195" data-end_ts="2435.475" title="2435.195" id=c_"2435.195">__Such__</span> Explorer series, which did for ethnographic music, what ECM did for a certain sort of European chamber jazz. Right. More recently curatorial labels that we have now that continue, I think to be great would be labels like dust to digital who are, tireless in their pursuit of interesting, cultural minutia from our past. They have a box set of 70 eighths from Southeast Asia, from the early part of the 20th century called Longing for the Past. Right. That will take the top of your head off. They're about to put a box out of Paul Bowles live recordings in Morocco that he did for the Smithsonian in the 1960s. They, they're just tireless in that pursuit. But there's also a sense in which, there are little, if, if you're interested in kind of what places that are curatorial, the other place that I suggest that people look would be labels that combine the sales of their own work with work that's like it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>So, I mentioned Erstwhile records a little bit earlier. The Erstwhile Records website, not only sells, work that, John Abbey initiates as part of the label, but also things that kind of hover around in that same territory. He's really careful about what he includes and what he suggests. Right. There's a label in the UK called Fluid Audio that does, does really interesting kind of work, I would say, in that sort of, neo ambient chamber territory that has, a great selection of interesting work. So there are places, there are places to look, that handle that curatorial stuff. But now, the range of stuff is, is so broad that you really have to be, guided by stuff that <span style="color:red" data-ts="2551.865" data-end_ts="2552.085" title="2551.865" id=c_"2551.865">__has__</span> stuff that works outside of that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It seems to me, and you can tell me maybe I'm wrong, maybe there isn't more stuff being released now than there ever has been, but it sure seems like it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>I think that's fair. I think that's fair. And I think that there's also, I think that the mo I think that the move toward <span style="color:red" data-ts="2572.865" data-end_ts="2573.085" title="2572.865" id=c_"2572.865">__El__</span>, especially electronic work and especially certain kinds of improvisation as becoming a kind of folk music is now complete Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>And a consequence of that is there are, there are a billion folk singers and, they're all kind of competing for space. Right. And the difficult thing for me has been there's so much of it. And, some of it is sufficiently self-similar that I don't feel as if I feel as if I've had better success looking for interesting work by, paying attention to details and asking my friends. Right. And, and so here's something that people will probably, some people out there may be upset about my talking about, but I'll do it because I think it's kind of straight ahead. I think one of the things about the rise of things like Facebook is that we now have, place places where people post, their own work, which is great. I don't have a problem with that at all. As somebody who goes through it and listens to it though, and watches it carefully, it's really problematic, first of all, because people tend to post things that are like other things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>They post, here's the mix of my piece for today, or last Thursday, or something like that. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> the work kind of, groups in ways that don't lend itself to the idea of physical pieces. They may not see their discourse as being like that, but there's like that. And when they do announcements for it, they look like they're trying to imitate somebody else's press releases that the, the press releases are just as bad as commercial press releases. And any of you who have read commercial press releases know how hard they are to write and how bad they usually are. They're just depressing. And you sort of think, well, if you're doing your own work, you could probably do a little bit better than that maybe. But the problem for me has been, if you sort of know what the territory of a genre looks like, it's gonna be harder to find somebody in that territory that's personally compelling. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>It does happen, but I tend to do better with, well, one of the other things that, that marks those groups, and I've, I've actually gone into a couple of them and, and grumped about it. They're sort of exercise, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2715.165" data-end_ts="2715.385" title="2715.165" id=c_"2715.165">__oh__</span>, narcissism is not the right word, but it's a whole bunch of people in a big room shouting and pointing at themselves. So if you listen to their work, you haven't found any, anything about what they value, what their interests are. There's, there's nothing about anything other than, this is my thing, yo Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and my, I tend to locate work that trusted agent model is, is still valuable. In fact, it's the thing that to me, it's the thing that replaced the old evil. There are only seven labels in the world thing. Right. Because the problem with the old system was there were only seven labels. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>They're evil. And every once in a while you get somebody who was kind of good. We think Clive Clive Davis was great because Clive Davis could listen to a whole bunch of things and find stuff that was great. Eh, I don't think he was that great, but that you get the idea. Sure. For me, the thing that's replaced the death of that system, which I do not want to return, don't get me wrong, is the trusted agent thing. And a lot of the, the space that's like a million wild wide and a half an inch deep, it's just not a satisfying place to fish. I would much rather be sitting in a bar, and listening to a conversation at the edge of a table. Oh. In fact, I'll give you two. Here are two things that I found out completely by accident that are astounding. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>The first one comes to me by way of, my friend Vance Galloway, who works in a very different field than I do. He's a great front of house sound guy, somebody you believe and listened to. So Vance says, well, I heard this record, that's really great. And he dropped a name, James Ginsburg. And again, since I do broadcasting, you have to know that James Ginsburg is half of a band called Empty <span style="color:red" data-ts="2829.325" data-end_ts="2829.545" title="2829.325" id=c_"2829.325">__Set__</span> that does kind of, post techno stuff. Okay. So I sort of know what James Ginsburg does. So Vance is kind of, we're sitting around having a drink. It was, I was in Seattle at the time, I think, sitting around having a drink. And Vance says, you know, so do you know about James Ginsburg's other thing? And I'm like, no, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2848.535" data-end_ts="2848.825" title="2848.535" id=c_"2848.535">__what__</span> James Ginsburg's what I'm thinking, he has a drum and bugle, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2853.605" data-end_ts="2853.845" title="2853.605" id=c_"2853.605">__core__</span> <laugh>, because that's the sort of thing that Vance would like. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Right. And he says, no, no. He actually did this guitar song kind of post folk record under the name Faint Wild Light. And my first thought was like, no, you're kid. You know, it's sort of like, yeah. And did you know that he plays bluegrass banjo too? Right, right. It was just such a bizarre little story that I thought, this sounds really kind of interesting. So I went and found it. It was Mag faint Wild Light. It was magnificent. So I wish the internet gave me more than that. Here's another one. Those of you who are really sick of dubstep, I know that there are people that aren't, but those of you who just find dubstep annoying, probably are aware of the fact that it's kind of, it has some sub genres that followed it, that were based on the idea that people got really sick of doing dubstep. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Right. So one of them is bass music. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So there's this guy that runs <span style="color:red" data-ts="2908.965" data-end_ts="2909.085" title="2908.965" id=c_"2908.965">__a__</span>, a, a bass label called Hemlock. His name was, Jack Dunning. And he, he's, he does a really good job of that kind of stuff, and it records under the name Untold. So I, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2923.625" data-end_ts="2923.845" title="2923.625" id=c_"2923.625">__it__</span> kind of knew his work. And, and I was, I was someplace sitting around and, and a bunch of people at the end of the table were complaining about Drummond Bass, and somebody said, well, yeah, there's a few like ex Drummond bass guys that do great stuff like that, that Dunning guy for Hemlock. And then all of a sudden somebody says, well, did you know that he's like, doing modular synth stuff now. And I'm like, what? So suddenly my ears like, perk up <laugh>. Right? And I'm like, what? Modular synth stuff. And, and, you know, I like scoot down to the end of the table as quietly as I can and say, wait, wait, wait. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>You mean modular synth stuff? Like what he does as untold as his, you know, stuff. And the guy's like, oh, yeah, you know who that guy is? And <span style="color:red" data-ts="2966.525" data-end_ts="2966.645" title="2966.525" id=c_"2966.525">__I__</span>, yeah, I do. And he says, yeah, no, it's, it's like analog <span style="color:red" data-ts="2969.785" data-end_ts="2970.005" title="2969.785" id=c_"2969.785">__sit__</span> stuff. In fact, he's like putting this thing out on like a USB drive and there's only a hundred of 'em made and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But there's this, so the Japanese version of his, album, blacklight Spiral has a dis in it. That's this, analog thing. That's it. It's fantastic. Wow. And so that's how I heard about that guy. You know, it's sort of like, that's kind of the stuff that you do. You have, you have your friends. And one of the first things I do when I meet, when I meet people who are willing to admit that they listen to my show, I have two questions for them. The first question is, what, you know, some version of what would I, what should I be doing more? What should I be doing less? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But the question that comes after that is, what's the last thing that you heard that either took the top of your head off, or the more, the simpler and more sociable one to say is, what's the last thing you heard that you liked so much that you acquired a physical copy of Right. Or you paid 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>For. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>And that's always <span style="color:red" data-ts="3034.545" data-end_ts="3034.765" title="3034.545" id=c_"3034.545">__the__</span>, that's like a great way to find, to find new stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. Well, that's awesome advice and <span style="color:red" data-ts="3044.945" data-end_ts="3045.165" title="3044.945" id=c_"3044.945">__an__</span> awesome insight into how you, how you pick material. One final question, and then, I'll leave you to your day. There's gonna be a lot of people listening here who are like, wow, it sounds like Gregory's show speaks to me and speaks about me. And, but I don't know any of his friends. How do I get his attention? Because remember, you started off this whole adventure by hauling some of your music as well as other people's music hauling him down and finding a willing recipient in a, in a radio station who is willing to take a listen. Right? Yeah. How do people, how do people approach you in a way that isn't annoying or, and maybe not you, maybe in the general case, how do people, what's the way to approach someone in a position to, to be a cultural, a cultural detector? Right? Mm-Hmm, <affirmative>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3108.875" data-end_ts="3109.165" title="3108.875" id=c_"3108.875">__Okay__</span>. How does, how does someone approach them in a way that is useful for that person and, and isn't annoying, right? How, how can, how can someone approach you with music that may be, may be useful for, you'll indicate in some way that you know you are, that, that you might be interested in, and that doesn't annoy you in the whole, Hey, I've got fabulous release and I'd like you to hear it. Press two, to continue <laugh>, you know? Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Yeah. You know, that's a, in some respects the answer, I think the answer to that question is a little bigger one. And that is, we, there's a tendency in our culture as people who are makers of things or, competent individuals to think that our work somehow speaks for itself. It's not uncommon to have people come to you for a job for exam here. Here's an example that's not about programming, but I, I think it, it has something to do with, that idea. Somebody comes to you for a job and says, I'm the best, thoracic surgeon in the universe, and you, you obviously need a thoracic surgeon. I'm not sure that the, that the neighborhood in which I work is those people. What I, what I find myself doing is I tend to trust work done by people whose ethos I understand, rather than the work itself. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Maybe because I'm not the sort of person that's automatically, compelled by every single thing that I hear. That's a consequence of listening to a lot of stuff, by the way. And it's sort of an unfortunate part of, there are two unfortunate side effects of having to do programming for other people all the time. One of them is, it's not that everything sounds the same, but that it's easier to categorize things right away. And the really bad one for me is it's really difficult for me to make my own work because the minute I put a sound down, I think, oh, now I'm trying to something. Right? Yeah. But, but the idea is, and, and we do this with jobs, you, I'm more, I guess I'm more the kind of person, if I were an employer, I would hire from my user community, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>I wouldn't hire based on the best resume that came in the door. Right? And that's a really diff that's a really difficult thing to tell people who are basically trying to make the work. Because in some respects, those kind of, if I'm a curatorial programmer, think of it like a curatorial record label. You're forming long-term relationships, with people whose work you release. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And the really complicated thing for somebody on the outside of that is if they're not your friend, then you can basically figure something like, well, they only put their friend's stuff out. That's not true. But it's more like the, the thing that informs that relationship is a shared aesthetic. If all you're going by is the surface feature of something, it's not always possible to like understand exactly what that shared aesthetic is. And for programming the same thing is true. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>At some point in, at some point in time, I was involved, in, a record label. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And one of the things about that was really interesting is we thought we'd set a fairly, broad range of what could be done. And what happened with the work that we got in as often as not was we got something that was like the last thing we put out <laugh>, because it was as if we'd given creators permission or the understanding that we didn't mind that kind of stuff too. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3327.005" data-end_ts="3327.245" title="3327.005" id=c_"3327.005">__Right__</span>. So all of a sudden we get more stuff. It's like that for listening. Sure. So what I tend to do is, I'm much more comfortable if I know something more about the person. It's one of the reasons that we find com. That's one of the reasons that you go to hear live music is you want to see the context of the work. You want to, you want to embed it. Of course. Because in some respects, as a programmer, what I want to do is kind of like find a version of that embedded stuff that's interesting. Put it on the air as a thing to potentially attract someone's attention. And once I have their attention, I can say This is a great piece of work. But you know, it's part of a bigger cultural discussion. Yeah. It has 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>A neighborhood. It has a neighborhood. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Right. And I do better, I do better with work that comes to me by somebody who lives in the same neighborhood. Right. That might be a tremendous, that might be a tremendous, tremendously awful position for me to be in <laugh>. I know there are people who don't, there are people who see themselves as, taxonomist and anthologist. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>John Schaeffer's show new sounds on WNYC is a great example of somebody who takes, his sort of taxonomic and anthologizing responsibilities very seriously. Indeed. It would be cool if I were that guy. I could maybe be that guy in like one or two little sub genres, but no, that's not me. So it's more, who you listen to. Right. And who you listen to is often decided by things that ex, you know, sort of move in a straight line from what you like. And of late, particularly with, submissions from other people, it's been really interesting to see people who basically, there are people who listen to my show for a long period of time before they actually give me anything. Right. They say, you know, I actually think it would make sense. You know, you wouldn't hate what I do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>That's a little more Midwestern way to put it. But the idea is <laugh> is that now that I get what you're doing 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>I sort of understand or people who basically say, I'm sorry, I can't really send you this. So for a long time, and this is still an issue for some stuff there, there was a briefly a period of of time where there was a successful genre, which was referred to as lowercase. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>And lowercase stuff was ridiculously quiet, beautiful work. It had much of, it had to be digital, but it was astounding work. The problem with lowercase was I couldn't play it. Right. And the reason I couldn't play it was I had cab drivers in my audience. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. I was gonna say it's, nobody wants to think that they tuned into a, a blanked out station. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="3484.355" data-end_ts="3484.575" title="3484.355" id=c_"3484.355">__Yep__</span>. Well, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3485.055" data-end_ts="3485.255" title="3485.055" id=c_"3485.055">__it__</span>, well, so here's another listener sponsored community radio thing. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3489.275" data-end_ts="3489.695" title="3489.275" id=c_"3489.275">__People__</span>, if people think the station goes off, has been, has gone off the air, they call us. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh yeah. What happened? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Yeah, that's right. Or, or they're they're very helpful. They say, I'm s I'm really sorry. I think you're off the air right now. <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>There might be something wrong with the transmitter <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Yeah. That's ex No, that's ex And and believe me, back in the early days of the station when our transmitter link was, how do we say this? A good deal. Less reliable than it is now. That was not an uncommon occurrence <laugh>. So people would call, so when I did certain kinds of like really quiet music or stuff, they had <span style="color:red" data-ts="3526.055" data-end_ts="3526.255" title="3526.055" id=c_"3526.055">__like__</span> lots of, of embedded silences. People will call you up. So there's a new, a new recording from Keith Rowe and John Tilbury. It's called, it's on sofa and it's called something Enough not to Know. The, the whole piece is three hours long, but it's basically like little tiny gestures with large amounts of sound in between, improvisers. Like tatami, same thing you play. If I play those people are afraid the station goes off the air. Right. Right. So I tend to not play them as much. Sure. But by now longer term listeners know that, that know that that's the case. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's a possibility. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Yeah. No, absolutely. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So that's really an amazing story and, and trip a question for you. Just 'cause we have to wrap it up. And I appreciate you taking the time. It's kind of blown right through here. I had a bunch more questions, but I'm just gonna wrap it up with this one. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>No, it's fun to talk. It's fun to not have to talk about myself all the time. Yeah, right. That's great. This is great. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="3585.005" data-end_ts="3585.245" title="3585.005" id=c_"3585.005">__Well__</span> it's, it's interesting for us to have you give us clues about places to go listen to. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Well, I can still, I've got some more if you want <laugh>. Well 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Here's, here's the big clue I want from you, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3596.635" data-end_ts="3596.925" title="3596.635" id=c_"3596.635">__your__</span> desert. So you have listened to more stuff than probably anyone I know personally. Oh no. What's your Desert Island? Five. 
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Just blurt five out <laugh> because really the ones that the Yeah, the ones that surface are probably gonna be the ones that your gut is telling you are important anyway. Right. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Music for airports, Steve Res <span style="color:red" data-ts="3630.435" data-end_ts="3630.725" title="3630.435" id=c_"3630.435">__Teim__</span>.

<b>Darwin: </b>Unreal. Fantastic. Yep. Well thanks so much Gregor for your time. I appreciate it. It was great hearing, you know, hearing a different version of our discussions. But I just want the listeners to know almost any time I talk to you, it has that kind of engagement. I always enjoy our discussions and I want to thank you for your time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>No thank you. And I guess we can put up a link to the show. Well, in fact, actually yeah we can. So, thanks a lot for listening everybody and I appreciate your time. Thanks man. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Catch you later. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>See ya. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, many thanks again to Gregory for his time talking about what life is like on a 30-year-old radio program. I want to thank everybody for their continued support. Thanks for giving me a week off. Last week we got the house prepped for sale and it looks like it, it already sold. So that's a good sign. Those of you in the Minneapolis area, watch out. 'cause here I come. Other than that, thank you so much again for listening and I'll catch you next week. Bye.
