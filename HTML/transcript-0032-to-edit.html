<b>Darwin: </b>All right. This week, we have an extreme pleasure. I got, an email the other day from one of the people that I consider my New York guys. I, I have my group. We interviewed me Shael before. She's one of my New York guys, even though she's not a guy, but, and I've talked to Luke who's, who's, one of my New York people, and I have the extreme pleasure today of introducing y'all to Todd Reynolds another one of my New York people. But also one of the people that I find inspiring across the board. And so it's great, opportunity to meet up. Hi, how 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd Reynolds: </b>You doing? Thanks for the kind words. That's lovely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, it's, it's really serendipitous cuz I kind of, I interspersed the interviews with different kinds of people. So sometimes, real technologists other times, really focus. I do a lot of speaking with people who are doing like modular synthesis, stuff like that, but I really like it when I get a chance to talk to people I think are artists. And I would say that you represent probably the, the most premier artists that I know personally. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Oh man. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So there 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>At that, I don't have to deal with that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>No, but I, I say that because, you have, you're a person who integrates, musical performance with technology, but in a way that I think is incredibly artful. And so getting the chance to interview is, is really neat because I want to kind of dive into a little bit of that, hopefully. So for those of you who don't know, Todd is, does, currently I think you're mostly doing solo work, right? Right. Is a solo violin performer who, sort of has completely integrated Ableton live and max for live into his performance world, such that he does these performances <span style="color:red" data-ts="133.64" data-end_ts="133.84" title="133.64" id=c_"133.64">__that__</span> are incredible incredibly musically rich. And a lot of that is because he <span style="color:red" data-ts="138" data-end_ts="138.12" title="138" id=c_"138">__is__</span> a pretty fantastic, violin player, but also because he has been very savvy about using technology, but not having his performances be about technology. Does that seem fair? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>It seems totally fair. And it, and it, it goes directly to what is not what I try to be about, but sort of more what I've evolved into and, and it, and you know, the story starts, you know, very long time ago. I mean, I started playing the violin when I was four years old and this <span style="color:red" data-ts="167.92" data-end_ts="168.04" title="167.92" id=c_"167.92">__is__</span> Zuki method, just like most people do. And, and I grew up playing the, playing the concertos and Bach that every other violinist kid plays. And, and by the time I was, 17 or 18, I was good enough that, I got the chance to study with the, who I consider the greatest violence of all time. His name was Yaha Heitz and there some, some people know his name, some people don't. So I don't say it with any, you know, assumption that anybody knows, his name, but I should spell it for you in case you wanna look him up it's Yasha, as you would expect. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>And then Heitz H E I F E T Z. And, Mr. Heitz back, you know, 25, 30 years ago was known by everybody. Right. You know, this was, this was normal. So I studied with him for about two or three years and my parents' intention, you know, starting me on the violin that early was that I would become something akin to that. You know, that the soul was <span style="color:red" data-ts="224.96" data-end_ts="225.12" title="224.96" id=c_"224.96">__two__</span> stands in front of an orchestra. And, and does that, and that when I got to conservatory, which was the Eastman school of music when I was, 21 or 22, when I finally went to school, I found out very quickly that a couple of things, number one, was that everybody was trying to do that. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And also that it was a very lonely life. And I would even read stories of, Iza, Pearlman, you know, going to, going from gig to gig, to gig and the host taking him out for dinner. And then he goes home to a hotel room and then, you know, the next day's the same thing. And, and, and I was like, wow, this doesn't seem all that great. Right. And the other thing that hit me when I, when I got to conservatory, which really changed my world was I fell in with a bunch of, composers just as, as friends, one, one guy, one guy in particular, and, and this guy was a very, what's the word I'm looking? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Very <span style="color:red" data-ts="281.78" data-end_ts="282" title="281.78" id=c_"281.78">__cur__</span> charismatic guy. Oh, okay. And, and he, and he really fought me. He's like, why, why, why do you, why do you wanna do this, this old music? You know, there are people writing music today. <span style="color:red" data-ts="291.54" data-end_ts="291.76" title="291.54" id=c_"291.54">__Why__</span>, you know, and within my first year I had sort of almost in an evangelistic sense, given my life to the performance of, of what we now and even then called contemporary music or new music. Right. Right. And so in that, in that field, you know, I was just meeting composers and I was spending all my time at school playing the most thorny, Western European, second V and <span style="color:red" data-ts="313.24" data-end_ts="313.36" title="313.24" id=c_"313.24">__E__</span> school avant guard stuff. You could, I could get my hands on. So it was only Carter's in <span style="color:red" data-ts="318.2" data-end_ts="318.48" title="318.2" id=c_"318.2">__nous__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="318.48" data-end_ts="318.68" title="318.48" id=c_"318.48">__and__</span> bait, and this is in li and this is like all I wanted to play. And of course everything else was awful. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>And Steve <span style="color:red" data-ts="325.52" data-end_ts="325.76" title="325.52" id=c_"325.52">__rice__</span> was awful and it <span style="color:red" data-ts="327.24" data-end_ts="327.32" title="327.24" id=c_"327.24">__was__</span> like the simple stuff. And, you know, and I really, I really went off the deep end with this stuff, even to the, to the degree that I really thought that if I did it right, I could get everybody to like be Allen Fort and be listening to music in, in sets of four, one and three tubes and, and te <span style="color:red" data-ts="343" data-end_ts="343.36" title="343" id=c_"343">__records__</span>. And I really believe that this was how music was traveling and pop music damned. And, that was my first year at Eastman. And as my, as my education increased and I continued to sort of broaden outwards in my third year of Eastman, I, took an audition randomly for the principal, second violin position of the Rochester, Phil harmonic there in town. And I got it. So, <laugh>, I don't know how, and, so two years later I was sitting in the orchestra, you know, looking at my, my possible improbable career path and, know, looking at what it would take to move up the ranks to the position of an adequate, you know, really adequate salary and, and a, a rewarding life. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>And I realized that that was not where I was gonna find it. I had that very traditional American thing going on of like, you know, I wanna find my own voice. I want to individuate. I wanna, you know, so one day off a whim I turned left instead of right. And went up the stairs to the office and said, I'll be gone in September. And the CEO said, you know, is this a money conversation? Do you need more money? I didn't know what a money conversation was. <laugh>, you know, it was only 23 or <span style="color:red" data-ts="411.08" data-end_ts="411.28" title="411.08" id=c_"411.08">__so__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="411.28" data-end_ts="411.36" title="411.28" id=c_"411.28">__or__</span> 24 or something like that. And, and so, so I, I just quit and, I decided to go back to school cause I'd been playing in first position that's for those of you <span style="color:red" data-ts="421.4" data-end_ts="421.6" title="421.4" id=c_"421.4">__do__</span> don't know violin lingo, that's, you know, the easy position that's, that's, that's down near the, near the scroll. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>And when you've been doing that for a year, you've sort of lost some of your ability to play up high said, okay, let me go back and get my chops back. So I, I moved down toward New York city without a bachelor's degree to pursue a master's at SUNY at Stony Brook. And there was a guy there named Dan Wayman, who is a composer, and he came outta Berkeley and he had just been hired with a budget of something like, I don't know, 45 grand or something to build a computer music studio there at Stony Brook. Up to that time, Darius <span style="color:red" data-ts="459.05" data-end_ts="459.4" title="459.05" id=c_"459.05">__Simin__</span> had brought all three of Bulent RLS or, or maybe Bulent came to SUNY. I'm not sure the, of the history, but there were all these tape cutting electronic music studios, they're all beautiful wood stuff, you know, that they had built. And, and so one of these was dismantled and one of these rooms opened up and Dan started putting in stuff, Yamaha <span style="color:red" data-ts="481.2" data-end_ts="481.32" title="481.2" id=c_"481.2">__teaching__</span> 70 sevens, you know, S <span style="color:red" data-ts="482.92" data-end_ts="483.04" title="482.92" id=c_"482.92">__Y__</span> 30 threes and all, all these little sort of old synthesizer that we don't even think about anymore. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>And, and an SC 30, a Mac <span style="color:red" data-ts="489.9" data-end_ts="490.12" title="489.9" id=c_"489.9">__SC__</span> 30, which had, which had David Zellis, you know, vision, you know, it was, it was like, it was, it was op code days, right? Yeah. And, and it's, you know, then, and then a year later, max, you know, the first edition max and studio vision, four tracks of audio. Oh my God. And so during my tenure at SUNY Stonybrook, I discovered lots of things. I mean, I, I, first of all, realized that this militancy toward sort of avant garish new music that this intellectual academic thing I was in was no longer rewarding for me. Right. And I began to realize that there was that there were whole segments of world musics and pop musics and all sorts of other stuff and technology that I was not paying attention to. So I started to pay attention to it. And there at Stony Brook, my best friend and myself, Michael <span style="color:red" data-ts="541.66" data-end_ts="541.88" title="541.66" id=c_"541.66">__Lok__</span>, and one of the most extraordinary musicians and programmers that I know, and who was to become my best friend. We spent every night in that computer music studio. And there was only one composer of Dan's in his class that was interested in playing in that studio. So we got the keys to the kingdom. Sure. Dan Waymoth gave us the keys to the kingdom, and that's the reason I'm the musician I am today. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that's amazing. First of all, it, it's, it's interesting to me how often Stony Brook comes up, because sort of like in the general discourse of schools, Stony Brook, isn't that widely known mm-hmm, but oh my God. In the music world, there are so many people that have come out of there or have gone through there, or like in case of Meg are there right now. Some real luminaries of the whole electronic music past and present are gravitating around Stony Brook. What is it about Stony Brook that causes that to happen? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Well, first of all, I, I mean, it's, it's, it's funny. I, I can't, you don't know. I mean, well, I mean, I can't answer the question. I mean, the one thing I can tell you about my day, and it's not only electronic music, of course, it's like, if you take a look at all of the major new music performers, everybody from conductors, like Brad Loveman, chamber musicians like Tara hell, <span style="color:red" data-ts="624.48" data-end_ts="624.6" title="624.48" id=c_"624.48">__and__</span> O'Connor a flutist, Jackie LeClair, who's now at McGill, you know, all of us people we, that was known as the new music school, because greatly because of <span style="color:red" data-ts="634.6" data-end_ts="634.72" title="634.6" id=c_"634.6">__a__</span> pianist named, Gil <span style="color:red" data-ts="636.39" data-end_ts="636.68" title="636.39" id=c_"636.39">__Kish__</span> who was there. Oh yes. And a lot of the, the New York sort of new music inte Genia went out there to teach. So it's sort of, it's always been known as a new music school. I don't really know what it's like now, but I do know unless I'm incorrect that it was Dan Wayman, this same guy who created this program, that Meg was hired to direct this whole new media thing happened after I left way after I left school. And when I heard about it, I'm like, I didn't even really understand what new media was then <laugh>, but you know, the idea that this was gonna happen at that school, I'm like, well, that's pretty forward looking. And I didn't know if it was gonna mean anything or do anything, but then, you know, fast forward and yeah. Meg and Dan and their students coming through there every day doing, doing great work. So there's something in the water. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Apparently 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Or in the water 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>For people who don't know how far is Stoney book from 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>New York city. Yeah. From New York city, it's exactly a two hour train. Right. Or just, just under a two hour train. <span style="color:red" data-ts="690.88" data-end_ts="691" title="690.88" id=c_"690.88">__Right__</span>. So it's not a, it's about corner by a car. It's like seven hours with traffic, you know, it's just like, it's awful. I couldn't, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="698.96" data-end_ts="699.08" title="698.96" id=c_"698.96">__could__</span> never live out there now it's impossible, but it's, you know, it's right on the water. It's, it's a pretty, pretty cool place to pretty cool place to be. And I haven't been out to the, I haven't been invited actually out in years. But, but the I, and so I don't know what the campus is like Meg, of course I'm sure told you. And, and I'm, I, I know I watch Meg carefully because she, she does great work and she's, a real thoughtful, thoughtful 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Educator. Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="727.72" data-end_ts="727.88" title="727.72" id=c_"727.72">__Pretty__</span> much. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>And so, so I know that she's, she's amassing great tools and, and, and, teaching our kids. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I think what we have to do, you and I have to team up on Meg and like force her to get us out there for 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>That's fine. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I think that would be 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Great. <laugh> I think that would be great. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But now, the other thing I wanna kind of explore is you were on a track, you were on a track to sort of like follow the traditional history of classically trained violinists, which is, you know, you're supposed to start in that second chair <span style="color:red" data-ts="761.9" data-end_ts="762.12" title="761.9" id=c_"761.9">__way__</span> on the, offsite of the orchestra and slowly work your way up. And by being very politically correct. And by being very deferential to all of your better, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="772.07" data-end_ts="772.36" title="772.07" id=c_"772.07">__Also__</span> being choppy, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="773.78" data-end_ts="774" title="773.78" id=c_"773.78">__is__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Real. Yeah. And, and pulling your weight that, eventually in some many large, some number of years measured in two digits, right. You would get your break. But you also point to this idea that it's sort of very American to say, that's not, that's not a viable path. How much resistance did you run into because you weren't willing to stick with the path that was standardized or, or was there something also in the air at the time that said, do your own thing, man, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>I, I experienced zero resistance, but I think that, that off times, you that's, that's really depending upon where you're looking, right? Like it's like, what, what angle you're looking at? The, I remember the, first thing as I mentioned was the CEO saying, you know, is this a money conversation? Right. But, and my parents of course were, and everybody was like, no, no, you're not you, you're 25 years old. You have no credit card debt. You're making what at that point was <span style="color:red" data-ts="837.28" data-end_ts="837.4" title="837.28" id=c_"837.28">__a__</span>, a heroes ransom, $40,000 a year in Rochester. Right. You know, you're making anybody else in the music, in the, in the orchestra. Not everybody besides the concert master, but you're making a premium cuz you're playing a principal chair. Right. Nobody does this you're nuts. So that was it. But then I, but then I go back to school where everybody's in a different position and the, the school is welcoming me <span style="color:red" data-ts="861.48" data-end_ts="861.76" title="861.48" id=c_"861.48">__without__</span>, without a bachelor's degree cuz of some precedent they had with job experience. So I'm like, I'm welcomed there. Then I meet this guy named Dan Waymoth who's music. I also end up playing and he becomes my, my real mentor, the guy who really, really helped me answer the questions I needed to answer, to become who I needed to become. He was he and my violin teacher there at SUNY <span style="color:red" data-ts="880.8" data-end_ts="881.24" title="880.8" id=c_"880.8">__Storybrook__</span> were my savior. They were the ones who opened up the world <span style="color:red" data-ts="884.84" data-end_ts="885" title="884.84" id=c_"884.84">__to__</span> me. So I can't, I, so I can't say that I experienced any resistance. Well 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's cool. And again, you're you're right. Maybe by focusing your gaze in the right direction, you didn't have to put up with it. That's cool. So you sound like you were in a pretty privileged, privileged position still though, because you found yourself in a place where you had access to this stuff without having to like work as a barista to make the money, to get <span style="color:red" data-ts="912.08" data-end_ts="912.36" title="912.08" id=c_"912.08">__your__</span> S <span style="color:red" data-ts="912.88" data-end_ts="913" title="912.88" id=c_"912.88">__Y__</span> 77. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Right? Exactly. Exactly. And I wasn't, I wasn't really paying anything for school either. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So in that kind of circumstance, what did you gravitate towards? So that was really, there was like a huge explosion of like popularized tools, right? So you have Yamaha coming out with all their stuff, right? You have, rollin and you have, other people coming out with tons of hardware. You've got op code and, and, <span style="color:red" data-ts="941.16" data-end_ts="941.44" title="941.16" id=c_"941.16">__mode__</span> two and all and Cubase all coming out with their incredible software. That's integrating audio. There were a million options to take. Which one did you find most compelling? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Well, I, I actually, I actually went hardware first because, because the, the whole, the whole, you know, ability of software was not there yet at all. And, and so what, one of the things that I knew that I wanted to do was learn to improvise. I was like, you know, this is something I need to need to do. And I discovered the digital delay. This was, you know, so, so if you wanna know what I gravitated toward, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>The digital delay, which remains, you know, the backbone of my work. Right. So, so it was, you know, big, big reverbs and digital delays coming out of a, of lexicon LX P one and an LX P five, which I then with lake Butler pedals. Oh wow. Because I learned how to control them so I could, so I could do this, I'm making, accelerator pedals, continuous controller motions with my hands right now. <laugh> and, and so, so that was it. And so I discovered that, you know, improvising in a room was awful because, you know, I remember, I remember going into our studio once and I'm like, today, I'm going to learn to improvise. So I shut off the lights. So I wouldn't even have to face myself. Right. Right. With, with the humiliation of what I was about to hear. Right. And so, you know, I'd say, okay, well, everybody's gotta start with a note. So let's start somewhere. And I'm like, you know, so I played a note, I played a C I'm like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1028.34" data-end_ts="1028.56" title="1028.34" id=c_"1028.34">__ah__</span>, damn, everybody plays a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1030.4" data-end_ts="1030.52" title="1030.4" id=c_"1030.4">__C__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1030.74" data-end_ts="1030.96" title="1030.74" id=c_"1030.74">__But__</span> a normal, normal note. I'm, I'm never gonna succeed at this. This is awful, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>And, and then I'd be, okay, well, press on, press on. And then, you know, and I'd be playing. And all of a sudden I hit a D and I'm like 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>A D no, no. See, I mean, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1044.26" data-end_ts="1044.68" title="1044.26" id=c_"1044.26">__seeing__</span> a D how Benal 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Is that? You know, so, so finally what I, what I, then, then I would start to, you know, I would start to like, put some stuff into some big re theres the digital delays, and I say, okay, well, you know what, try playing what, you know. So, so I'd like, you know, pull out a lick from the, from the violin and concert when I forced myself to get comfortable with that. And, and I, I just set stuff up to be able to sort of loop back at me without any sort of time base, you know, without any clock or anything, cuz that didn't exist. Right. And so, so in, in doing so I, I made my, made my first electronic pieces, which I don't think anybody's ever actually heard they're they don't stop, but they're not great either. But, but that's, I, I gravitated toward the world of sort of recording myself in real time and processing myself in real time. So I guess we can say that. And when I did that, the one thing, what I haven't told you is that when I was 16 and 17, I was actually, you know, radio shack used to have computer stores. We used to call 'em 11 stores. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1107.65" data-end_ts="1108" title="1107.65" id=c_"1107.65">__Right__</span>. And I was a salesman. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, nice. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>I remember the model 100. So you were for the first laptop. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Right. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>And, and so I sort of had had this, this technological desire and bent already, ever since, the model 2000, the first color, real color dense, you know, monitor computer. And so I, I thought to myself as I had these hardware devices and I bought my Mesa, Boge mark three amp and my electric violin, I thought to myself, you know, someday, this is all gonna be <span style="color:red" data-ts="1139.76" data-end_ts="1139.88" title="1139.76" id=c_"1139.76">__the__</span> laptop. It's gotta be. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>10 years later it was. And I entered into the Ableton camp, version 2.0 and somehow as a college student, even, or post-college student, I had gotten it into my mind that, you know, if a rock and roll musician can tell the story, which gets them an endorsement <span style="color:red" data-ts="1159.76" data-end_ts="1159.88" title="1159.76" id=c_"1159.76">__and__</span> gets them a relationship with a company, that's really what I'd like as a relationship with a company. So I could understand, better learn, participate. You know, maybe I could do that too. So I started making phone calls and with different companies, I would, I would be able to sometimes call and say, I would love to embark on a, you know, on investigation with you. Could I have an even <span style="color:red" data-ts="1179.16" data-end_ts="1179.44" title="1179.16" id=c_"1179.16">__tied__</span>, you know, H 3000 sure for a month and they gave it to me. Right. And then I would make pieces with the H 3000. So it was still very much hardware. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>And I think Ableton was Ableton was my way in cuz that was the first thing that did anything real time. There's still some latency problems, but not that much. And I was able to do stuff and I've, I've been, I I'm not with the company in that way, but I'm, I've been with that software as my primary sort of, piece of software ever since that time. And I am <span style="color:red" data-ts="1209.8" data-end_ts="1209.96" title="1209.8" id=c_"1209.8">__an__</span> Ableton artist and I do have relationships with people in the company and I'm really concerned with the, I mean the company doesn't need me at all for its success, but I'm, I'm interested in supporting the success of that company and, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_%2774">Cycling '74</a> too. And my, my favorite pieces of software, to use because of this first bent that I had toward real time. Right. You know, working in manipulation, the sound 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. Well, that's, first of all, it's hilarious to bring the Tandy machines out. Talk about something I haven't thought about in ages, but also this idea of like ear the early cause I agree there was a sense at which, you know, you'd be sitting behind this big tower of gear and you just had the sense that, this was gonna eventually end up on a laptop for me. The first time I saw it when Cubase DST came out and all of a sudden there were plugin effects that you could use on these audio recordings on, and it would work on a laptop just barely mm-hmm <affirmative>. I mean, you could just, you had to, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Like, you could crash it 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Really easy. You had to turn the crank really fast, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Make it go right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But it would kind of work. And, I remember I was on a, I was on a train trip. I was going from Chicago, a train trip from Chicago to Washington, state of Washington. And I had gotten a sleeper car and I had my old Mac laptop and I had gotten both digital performer and Cubase VST <span style="color:red" data-ts="1307.56" data-end_ts="1307.68" title="1307.56" id=c_"1307.56">__on__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1307.68" data-end_ts="1307.84" title="1307.68" id=c_"1307.68">__it__</span>. And again, and, and I was just like, I'm gonna sit in <span style="color:red" data-ts="1311.68" data-end_ts="1311.8" title="1311.68" id=c_"1311.68">__the__</span> sleeper car and figure this stuff out and really make sure that it works. And by the time I got off the train car, I was, I like it blown myself away. I know, right. It was, it was so awesome. It was such an amazing experience, but that had all been preference prefaced by years and years and years of working with working with delay pedals, working with reverb pedals or reverb, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1337.72" data-end_ts="1337.92" title="1337.72" id=c_"1337.72">__rack__</span> gear, working with big mixing desks and all that stuff. And I have to say, I felt like at the time, at least I felt like it was a good thing. I'd started off with all it hardware because it really properly set the stage for doing this stuff. But 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I was also really quick to just bail on hardware. I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1360.08" data-end_ts="1360.12" title="1360.08" id=c_"1360.08">__was__</span> second I could bail on hardware. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Oh, I was too. I was too. I mean, what, what's interesting about hardware though, and it's still, it's sort of like this, <laugh> this argument for vinyl too. There's I, I cannot. And I'll, I, I'm not savvy enough to really know why, but you know, I cannot get the sound out of any max patcher out of any Ableton live combination of devices, which will match an even type Orbi sound hardware sound. I cannot, you know, just, just the, just the, the preamp <span style="color:red" data-ts="1389.64" data-end_ts="1389.8" title="1389.64" id=c_"1389.64">__average__</span>, something about the electricity in that stuff. So it's like, yeah. It's so, so, and then that's why I think so many people like yourself love modulars too. It's just like, there's a quality there. And, and I've, I have never really jumped back into that. I still, I can't, I'm getting older, so I can't carry my Orbi and the planes too. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>It makes it harder. So I can't carry my Orbi all the time, but when I'm at home, I, I mean, I'll, I'll often choose that, you know, as a, as a, as a sound device. And if I can't then I, I, I settle for whatever I can get out of my laptop, but the ability to travel with nothing but a laptop, a soft step, which is, if anybody who knows that foot pedal is about a half inch tall and weighs less than it than the recorder we're we are using to record this and, you know, just to be able to travel with so much of nothing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, and so, so hardware, so other than your violin and apparently a pickup, I would 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Assume, right. I use an LR bag pickup, which is a Paso trans <span style="color:red" data-ts="1451.39" data-end_ts="1451.68" title="1451.39" id=c_"1451.39">__user__</span> right. In the bridge. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. And then your laptop and the soft step. Do you have any other hardware? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Oh yeah. I'd actually, and there's a, I'm just right now just finishing up, making my very first ever gear page on my website. Oh, okay. Which is getting completely overhauled, I'm, I've, I've become a little bit of a, of a controller slut, even though I don't use them all to my greatest advantage much <laugh> but I I'm I've right now in my stable have, well, Ableton push, obviously. And of course, which is, you know, the only real drawback to that is that it's a little heavy to, to, to carry. But, but I love that, that piece. I also use native instruments machine. Right. And then I've got, a live instruments, Omar GB. I love that company. I love those guys. I love everything they stand for and everything that they can, that they've made available in terms of programming. Their control are right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1509.64" data-end_ts="1509.76" title="1509.64" id=c_"1509.64">__A__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1509.94" data-end_ts="1510.16" title="1509.94" id=c_"1509.94">__Ono__</span> 2 56, and an arc four, both of which I've found, found it really hard to find a way into, I'm still struggling with that. And I, I really want to wanna make use of these machines, but that's really more about me being a better programmer than it is anything else. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1525.69" data-end_ts="1526.04" title="1525.69" id=c_"1525.69">__Cause__</span> those, those devices are amazing. And then, well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>There's such a beauty 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>To em. Oh. And then they're, and they're beautiful. Like let's not even talk about that, but, then the innovation launchpad and, launch control, these are my, these are my like, and so when I go out, if I really need to go out and carry something in a bag, yeah. I will carry my soft step. My laptop, a tiny little impedance matcher sort of preamp by, Sarno. Okay. It's ed Sarno. Is it is his name? I hope it's anyway, his, big thing is called the steel guitar black box and it makes any Paso transducer sound good instead of okay. And it's, and I, and it's all it is that I can tell is like this, like two buffer pre <span style="color:red" data-ts="1567.16" data-end_ts="1567.28" title="1567.16" id=c_"1567.16">__a__</span> it's not even a preamp. They don't call it a preamp. It's just, it's a buffer sort of thing. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1571.42" data-end_ts="1571.64" title="1571.42" id=c_"1571.42">__Or__</span> don't even understand it's a break. Right? <span style="color:red" data-ts="1573.03" data-end_ts="1573.32" title="1573.03" id=c_"1573.03">__Yeah__</span>. So anyway, I got a smaller one that's coming in the mail. And then, then for controllers, I'll take, I will use touchable on my iPad. Right. And I will take the launch control out just so I have some dials that little small launch control. It's a hundred bucks. I mean, really? So, so that's, so I'm pretty portable. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, cuz I was gonna say, when you started doing your guitar slut, walk of shame there <laugh> I was like, sounds to me like it'd be easier carrying the Orville <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1601.87" data-end_ts="1602.16" title="1601.87" id=c_"1601.87">__Well__</span>, if I'm gonna carry all. Yeah. And I don't carry all those things. So, so if I, if I'm gonna take, I mean there's actually on my, Google plus page, there's a, there's a picture. The cover picture is, is of my rig from last year. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Okay. And that has the mono machine, the touchable launchpad Orville. And that's it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>So, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1627.59" data-end_ts="1627.88" title="1627.59" id=c_"1627.59">__when__</span> I really wanna do a whole hour's worth of show or I'm like working for somebody doing a live scoring thing, that's what I'll still do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So let's talk. So you just raised the spectrum of live scoring and, and you mentioned earlier when we were just talking <span style="color:red" data-ts="1641.55" data-end_ts="1641.84" title="1641.55" id=c_"1641.55">__that__</span> you're doing a little bit more scoring and soundtrack type work mm-hmm <affirmative> what does that look like when you're doing it? My assumption is it isn't like ha Zimmer style sitting behind, you know, five monitors worth of sequence. My assumption is that you do something maybe a little more off the cuff or is that not, not true? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>No, it's totally. I mean, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1665.61" data-end_ts="1665.96" title="1665.61" id=c_"1665.61">__Cause__</span> you strike me as like every time I've seen you play, it just seems to me like your style really lends itself to playing live and reacting to what the delays are, giving you reacting, reacting to what the environment's giving you. When an audience reacts, you play off of that, like with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1684.44" data-end_ts="1684.64" title="1684.44" id=c_"1684.44">__an__</span> extreme immediacy. And so it's hard for me to imagine doing that in a scoring environment, unless you're just sort of like giving yourself over to watching a picture and playing to the, and reacting to the picture. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>That's exactly it though. Yeah. I it's, it's a, it's a really, it's a really odd thing. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1702.84" data-end_ts="1702.96" title="1702.84" id=c_"1702.84">__I__</span> I'm, I get some, sometimes I get excited by it and sometimes I just get terribly scared by it. But what's really interesting is that, is that, I haven't moved very far, you know, in a way when, back in the, back in the day when I decided that I, or had the thought that I wanted to be a composer, a blank piece of score paper, just like a blank max patch. Yeah. Scared, scared the bejesus outta me. But then when I could get some stuff generated, then I could, then I could edit quickly and create quickly sort of doing both at the same time. And that, that became very fulfilling for me to do so still to this day, I'm happier getting up in front of, I don't care how many people, it's just not nerve wracking, not having an idea at all, what I'm gonna do and then make something up. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Sure. So the scene then goes to the, to the playing to picture, let's say, I have this, this cue that I'm gonna have to score. I will start playing to it. And, and as I play to it, you know, I'll do a few takes and some of those things will work together. Some of those, those won't, or, or I'll find a direction. And then I just start painting on top of that. I'm just now getting to the place where I can record 10 tracks at one time on, on my laptop while processing every one of them and just go, go from one to another and loop on top of them and then be able to then work with those 10 individual pieces of material. Right. So, so that gives me a whole lot of freedom cuz then I play something in that makes sense to me, it already has an art already has a form and then I can edit 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1796.14" data-end_ts="1796.36" title="1796.14" id=c_"1796.14">__And__</span> piece it together. Yeah. Well that's pretty interesting. I, I can imagine you doing that. Having seen you perform because that's sort of how your performance takes place or at least that's my perception. That 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Is exactly how <span style="color:red" data-ts="1808.32" data-end_ts="1808.4" title="1808.32" id=c_"1808.32">__it__</span>, what your performance is. It's always a combination of, maybe a little bit of pre-written material mm-hmm but not very much. And the other thing that part of my, what would, what would one call that part of my baggage that I bring from my sort of high level avant-garde experience? You know, my academic training is, you know, I, I, I do not want things to sound like somebody else. I don't want it to sound like en simmer. And I also don't wanna, I don't want to sound like synthesizers. It makes me really upset when I've done like a whole hour of performing from nothing. And then somebody comes up and says to me, were you playing to 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Track? Oh, isn't that? Isn't that irritating it's so I like to, so my stick is that I do live and unscripted performance of modular stuff, which is really weird because my whole thing is I start off with a blank 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Slate. Right, right, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1855.4" data-end_ts="1855.56" title="1855.4" id=c_"1855.4">__right__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So they literally watch me patch every noise in. Right. And when at the ends people come up and like, so how much of that was prerecorded and how much of it was done live. And I want to cry <span style="color:red" data-ts="1868.32" data-end_ts="1868.68" title="1868.32" id=c_"1868.32">__because__</span> I'm like, didn't you see, didn't you see those big gobs of sweat, like falling off my 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Forehead. Exactly. I really was 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Making burp sounds and I didn't want it to right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Right. No, but, but that's, it's such a, such a different level of, of knowledge that everybody has about this stuff and that, and so, I mean, I don't, I don't begrudge people their, their question at all, but but now I've now whenever I perform, I actually do a stick. Yeah. And now I say, you know what you're about to see just, just to sort of let you in behind the curtain right away. This is what happens here and, and, not, not so that you are any more or less amazed, but so that you can at least know that I'm making something up just for you. And this is not something that I made up for like a thousand people, you know, last <span style="color:red" data-ts="1914.08" data-end_ts="1914.2" title="1914.08" id=c_"1914.08">__week__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Previously. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I think that, there's another thing, which is when you're, when you're a performer, allowing the audience to understand sort of the risky nature of what's about to happen. It actually, to me, first of all, gives you a little bit of relief. So if it kind of does sort of not go great, there's not this sense of, well, you know, you're not really good, you know, so maybe it's a little insurance policy, right. But there's, it's also, they understand then that they're a participant 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>That's really important to me. That's really important to me cuz they, my, my whole thing about listening to, to music and like why we do, why you go to a concert and why you'll pay 250 bucks to go see James Taylor live when you could have paid $15 and heard the same thing in your living room on better speakers, you know? Right. If you're in audio file, the reason is because we seek shared experience, there's something about those other people in the room and that guy on stage, that's like, you're all experiencing it together. And that is a singular thing. And so, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1980.66" data-end_ts="1980.88" title="1980.66" id=c_"1980.66">__in__</span>, in any concert experience, there is a loop between the performer that goes through the soundman and around the audience and through every single person. So like I don't exist without an audience. Right. I really don't. And I, and, and, and recordings and everything, you know, still it's like <span style="color:red" data-ts="1998.11" data-end_ts="1998.4" title="1998.11" id=c_"1998.11">__that__</span>, they're, they're important. I would love to, to give my music to everybody. I would love to share the joy that I feel making music with people, through a piece of plastic or through, through bits, but really it's that shared experience of hanging out together and doing something. And I do like people to know that, you know, you are, you are as much a part of this. You are cause in the matter for this performance, right. It's not me, the artist. I mean, it's us doing this thing that we do as humans. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, now it's one like side street we can take here that I want to take is actually related to your recorded work. So was it 2012, you did out <span style="color:red" data-ts="2038.68" data-end_ts="2039" title="2038.68" id=c_"2038.68">__outer__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2039" data-end_ts="2039.12" title="2039" id=c_"2039">__Barrel__</span>, 2011, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>2011. And it was a much, much acclaimed release. You got some good kudos for that. I think. But one of the things I noticed and I'll, I'll admit, I helped introduce some people to it as well was it's starting to be used in performances where you weren't present. So for example, I do some work with a dance company. I do visual work with a dance company and they have a tendency to use sort of like modern classically infused work. Right. And I introduced them to, U C, D and they fell in love. And all of a sudden I got this like secondary Todd experience, which is, I'm hearing Todd, but I'm seeing dancers and I'm seeing my visual work and stuff like that. And it's something. So your 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Visual work was in that too? Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, okay. Great. And so all of a sudden I'm collaborating, collaborating with you, although you're not there <laugh> and these dancers are collaborating with you, even though you're not there. And I wonder, first of all, have you experienced like secondhand use of your work in that way ever? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Yes. Yeah. I mean, I, there are, there are people who've, who've approached me about using the work and I, and, and that has happened. I don't, I don't think I've seen all that much of it, you know, because it's like this, this is the thing, you know, you, you <span style="color:red" data-ts="2134.96" data-end_ts="2135.16" title="2134.96" id=c_"2134.96">__will__</span>, you make an agreement with somebody and you, you have a talk with 'em and, you know yeah. Make, make sure you share <span style="color:red" data-ts="2139.52" data-end_ts="2139.6" title="2139.52" id=c_"2139.52">__'em__</span>, you'd love to see it. And then you just, and then you, time passes. Yeah. Never 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Happens. Right. Well, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2143.84" data-end_ts="2144" title="2143.84" id=c_"2143.84">__because__</span> you never see it because especially in a performance environments like that, once the performance is over, everyone is so tired and so anxious to forget about 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Everything. Totally. Right. But there's this, for instance, there's this one, gentleman in Minneapolis, James <span style="color:red" data-ts="2157.65" data-end_ts="2158" title="2157.65" id=c_"2157.65">__Seoul__</span> is his name. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2158.44" data-end_ts="2158.6" title="2158.44" id=c_"2158.44">__Yeah__</span>. James se ballet. And, and James approached me. He enjoyed the work and he wanted to choreograph an entire half of a, of an evening to, and then he ended up calling it outer burrow. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Nice. And so the piece is called outer <span style="color:red" data-ts="2174.48" data-end_ts="2174.64" title="2174.48" id=c_"2174.48">__bur__</span> and it's got four pieces off the record. One by Michael loin <span style="color:red" data-ts="2178" data-end_ts="2178.24" title="2178" id=c_"2178">__stern__</span> and the other two by me. And then we do <span style="color:red" data-ts="2179.96" data-end_ts="2180.04" title="2179.96" id=c_"2179.96">__an__</span> improvisation and then one by guy named bill Ryan also from Michigan. And so, so, so, you know, I've, I've done this with him where it, it, it wasn't so much anything created from scratch, but it was more like he was gonna choreograph to this work and then we perform it together. Right. Perform <span style="color:red" data-ts="2194.68" data-end_ts="2194.8" title="2194.68" id=c_"2194.68">__it__</span> live. Sure. So we, we do this piece as a, as a touring piece now. So I've gotten to see, to see work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So did I just get these dance people in trouble because they didn't talk to you ahead of time? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Oh no, I don't know. No, no, no. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>All I know. I know that they're paying their performance right. Stuff. So maybe I hope you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>For no, no, no, I don't. I mean, this, this is the, this is the thing with the, well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm curious about how that 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Even grant rights do not get performed, do, do not get paid. Oh really? No. And in fact, what, what I do most of the time is if somebody does approach me and I do hope they do, because it's better for us to know when our work is being used. Right. Then not to. So, but I, but I'm not gonna call somebody and say, you're using my work without permission. You may not. I that's, that's just not my way. It's my right. But it's not my way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's, I mean, I'm curious about what, what is, what is supposed to be that, I mean, and 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>I'm sure there is no supposed to be okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>There, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>There, there <span style="color:red" data-ts="2248.76" data-end_ts="2248.84" title="2248.76" id=c_"2248.76">__is__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's what it seems like. It seems like kind of the wild west with all this stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>It is, it is totally the wild west when it comes to theater and when it comes to dance and, and, and it's the wild west and whoever has the most money always wins. So it's like, you know, if they're gonna use a red, hot chili peppers thing and the red hot chili peppers, lawyer is paid more than the other guy's lawyer, then that guy can come and shut this thing down, or else demand restitution in the form of 3,500 bucks. I don't know. But I mean, for us, you know, small time folks, just at the, on the bottom of the ocean, you know, I'm thrilled to hear that you shared my record with somebody who fell in love with and used it that just knowing that from you, number one is enough. Number two, if that person had, had, contacted me and said, we'd like to use your work for a, for a dance piece, which we're going to do eight times during this, this time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Right. I would say, okay, I'm gonna send you a licensing agreement. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And usually, usually I will receive a licensing fee of X, whether that would be 50 or a hundred dollars <span style="color:red" data-ts="2306.64" data-end_ts="2306.84" title="2306.64" id=c_"2306.64">__of__</span> performance, whatever. And then they're gonna say, well, we have no budget for music. And I'm like, well, you know what? I understand a lot of dance. People don't have budgets for anything except for maybe costumes and you really need those. So it's like, cuz you gotta, you gotta dance dressed in this culture. And so damn <span style="color:red" data-ts="2321.14" data-end_ts="2321.36" title="2321.14" id=c_"2321.14">__so__</span> I know. So, so, so at that point I say, you know, I will send you this, this licensing room, which I never get done, which basically says you have permission <span style="color:red" data-ts="2329.84" data-end_ts="2330" title="2329.84" id=c_"2329.84">__to__</span> my, to, to use my, my music in this context. And at least there's some sort of human agreement and respect, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. There's interaction, right. The interaction that represents the respect that maybe even if there's not money that respects sort of like 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Is that's it that's it. So it's like, there's so, so, you know, people ask me, would I charge you this event? I'm like, yeah. You know, sliding scale from, from zero to 1 million, you know, and nobody's ever given me that much, but I've gotten this <span style="color:red" data-ts="2357.24" data-end_ts="2357.48" title="2357.24" id=c_"2357.24">__much__</span> a lot, you know, so, but no, it's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2361.95" data-end_ts="2362.24" title="2361.95" id=c_"2361.95">__Well__</span>, I was, you know, I was actually curious about that because the way the music that you do actually, it's sort of like reminiscent of things without being a thing. I mean, so it happens. It, you hear it. And if you, if, if you're thinking in terms of soundtrack, it kind of sounds soundtrack. If you're thinking of performance tool for a dancer or something, it sort of has that feel to it. If you want to chill out with, and enjoy a relaxing, listen to a beautiful thing, it works 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>For that. If you wanna <span style="color:red" data-ts="2400.42" data-end_ts="2400.64" title="2400.42" id=c_"2400.42">__put__</span> on headphones and do 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And do sounding 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Exercises. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. Or, yeah. Or if you want to do the audio file thing, it works for that. Yeah. I mean, it's, it has sort of the ability to fit in a lot of places without sounding like it's pandering to any of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2415.6" data-end_ts="2415.68" title="2415.6" id=c_"2415.6">__them__</span> either. You know, which is, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>I mean <span style="color:red" data-ts="2417.4" data-end_ts="2417.52" title="2417.4" id=c_"2417.4">__here__</span> hearing you say, I mean, it's, it's, it's so funny. There are for each one of us individually, as artists, there are, there are a few things that can really, really get to us when somebody says them. And some, some of the things for me are all the things you just said. <laugh> some of the things for me are, what's what, what's another one. Oh, I, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2442.4" data-end_ts="2442.6" title="2442.4" id=c_"2442.4">__have__</span> I put on your record again just the other day, right? Somebody, the idea that somebody gave a second listen to my record. Yeah. That means a lot to me. So it's like the, the I, what, I, I didn't try. One of the things that I know is death is trying. Right, right, right. So, so I, I, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2463.56" data-end_ts="2463.84" title="2463.56" id=c_"2463.56">__they__</span> do want my music to be organic to me to be coming out of me as, as nothing, but the, some raw total of my voice, I will work at it to make it what I want, but I really do not want to be accused of trying to make a certain kind of music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>There you go. Nevermind. Even in order to accomplish X <laugh>, but just try, I, I, I really, which is why I like this starting from scratch thing on stage. Yeah. I'm okay. If it fails, I'm okay. If it wasn't great then, and I come off stage off and going, oh my God, that was such a mess. And, and, but still for somebody, they made something out of it. And since human beings are meaning making machines, they will do exactly that. If they're in the soundtrack head, it'll sound like that. If they're, and I don't want to like force the issue of, of what it is so that it can be accessible to the most amount of people, not for accessibility's sake, not for making money's sake, cuz that just doesn't happen anymore in music, unless you follow a different prescription of rigidity, like in pop music, like what you've gotta do to do 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That or dance music, for example. Yeah. Where you have to fit into a sub <span style="color:red" data-ts="2535.98" data-end_ts="2536.2" title="2535.98" id=c_"2535.98">__sub__</span> sub genre, you know, on base trap music or whatever exactly. Now the thing what's interesting is in talking about that with your music, I have seen it described as classical music. I've seen it described as experimental music. Mm-hmm <affirmative>, I've even seen it. I saw one review where they talked about it as a very interesting jazz album. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>And don't forget new age. I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2557.64" data-end_ts="2557.68" title="2557.64" id=c_"2557.64">__think__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That one too course, maybe I just didn't <span style="color:red" data-ts="2561.22" data-end_ts="2561.44" title="2561.22" id=c_"2561.22">__now__</span> new age or new <span style="color:red" data-ts="2563.04" data-end_ts="2563.24" title="2563.04" id=c_"2563.04">__age__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b><laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I don't remember how you pronounce that. Yeah. But, what, how do you deal with people's like undying desire to label things? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Yeah. You know, I just funny speaking of our, our mutual friend, Luke <span style="color:red" data-ts="2581.87" data-end_ts="2582.16" title="2581.87" id=c_"2581.87">__Duba__</span> we, Luke just had the first big, huge solo exhibition, like a retrospective down in Florida, the Ringling museum. Right. And one of the things he did as a celebration there was he brought a bunch of curators down and myself and, Jill Sigman and a, a, a choreographer and performance <span style="color:red" data-ts="2597.6" data-end_ts="2597.76" title="2597.6" id=c_"2597.6">__artist__</span>. And we all sat around the table and talked around the subject of a paper that he had written called genre creates ghetto mm-hmm <affirmative>. And it was a really compelling conversation, which really summed up what I felt for a long time. You know, I acknowledge the need for us to categorize and label. This is not something that's going away. And this is something, something that needs to be embraced and Cod gently, by the same token, you start labeling somebody and in your own mind and in the mind of who you're talking to and who you're writing about, you begin throwing all sorts of limits on, on that person, in that art. So, so I then as the artist have to not resist or reject, but simply channel it. So some somebody comes to me and says, you know, I really didn't like that piece that you did because it's much too simple. Then I just say, thank you. <laugh>, you know, I'm really glad to hear that you didn't like it because you number one had a response. And it gave me something to think about that I wasn't thinking about yesterday. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I was gonna say the fact that I got that it got enough attention that you would respond to. It represents some sort of success, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Some, some, some sort of success at connecting. Right, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2669.85" data-end_ts="2670.2" title="2669.85" id=c_"2669.85">__right__</span>. So, so, so the same with the, with the, with the labeling, I I've, I take it for granted that, that I'm gonna be labeled as a classical musician because that is the lineage from when, from once I come. Right. If you take a look at my whole sort of looping thing and the, and the way that I make music, you'll hear a lot of Steve rice <span style="color:red" data-ts="2689.2" data-end_ts="2689.4" title="2689.2" id=c_"2689.2">__in__</span> there. Who's been my boss for like 20 years. I'm a member of his ensemble heaven since 1990. And so, and you know, Terry Riley, who I love and respect all those minimalists. And then I'm like part of my bang on a can is my musical family. I'm the violinist for, for bang on a can. And one of the teachers at our Institute. So it's like, I am a classical musician at the same time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>I am a rock musician. I am a pop musician. I, I will float between anything only thing that I really try to stay away from is that I think I need another lifetime to learn Indian music. So I, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2719.86" data-end_ts="2720.08" title="2719.86" id=c_"2719.86">__so__</span> you won't catch me on stage trying to, to, to simulate that <span style="color:red" data-ts="2724.49" data-end_ts="2724.84" title="2724.49" id=c_"2724.49">__spark__</span> through one of those, you know? No, I, I mean, I try to take my first couple of my Indian violin lessons and I'm like, no freaking way. <laugh> no freaking way this, this is something even more so than jazz. You start. Right. You know, from the crack back back then at least jazz is America. It's like, America's quintessential music, jazz and bluegrass. And it's like, this is American music. Not that Western European stuff that we imported and sort of, you know, follow along with classical music. That's our, that's our music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>So it's like, I still, I, I grew up with that to a certain extent, although I'll never be able to hang out with the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2758.16" data-end_ts="2758.28" title="2758.16" id=c_"2758.16">__Whitney__</span>, Marc <span style="color:red" data-ts="2758.56" data-end_ts="2758.88" title="2758.56" id=c_"2758.56">__Salas__</span> folks right. On stage. Right. And you know, so, so now, so now I am who I am and if you're gonna come to me and say, as you just said, you know, sort of feel like your music's uncategorizable, then I'm like, great. <laugh> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2773.8" data-end_ts="2774.04" title="2773.8" id=c_"2773.8">__right__</span>. I like that 20% more than you coming to me and say, yeah, I can hear the classical influence in your music. I'll be like, great. Well, I can hear some bluegrass stuff in your music. Great. I'm I even hear some <span style="color:red" data-ts="2785.36" data-end_ts="2785.56" title="2785.36" id=c_"2785.36">__en__</span> yet in your music. I'm like, yeah, it's that reverb <laugh> you know, so it's like, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's all, it's all cake at this point, right? It's all cake. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Because at, at this point I do have to make a living and I make a living by hooker, by crook, teaching recording for people, soundtrack stuff, remote recording, you know, I'm like piecing together my living. But, but my, but what really makes me content in life is connecting to people. Sure. And whether that's through teaching or lecturing or doing Ted talks or doing, or, or, or playing concerts or collaborating with other artists across disciplines, whatever that stuff is, that's what, that's my life, right. That's, I'm about, and there's no amount, there's no amount of money which can compensate for that. All the money in the world would serve to simply make that easier to get up and do the next day. That's all that the, that the money and the living's about. So then if I can do that, if I can do that and keep on, meeting people and keep on stretching outwards and make my world bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger, then I'll, then I'll die. Happy. That's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Amazing that that was an amazing discussion. So, so far when we talk about your work, we've mostly focused on your solo work, but you are also quite well known as part of parts of different ensembles. So you mentioned, working with, bang <span style="color:red" data-ts="2875.3" data-end_ts="2875.52" title="2875.3" id=c_"2875.3">__can__</span>, which you've been involved with for a long, long time, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Over 20 years now, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Over 20 years. And, of working with the Steve resemble mm-hmm <affirmative>, what other group type work do you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Do? Well, in, in 1998 or 99, I started, a string quartet, which, which at first I had, I had, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2898.66" data-end_ts="2899.08" title="2898.66" id=c_"2898.66">__gained__</span> to start sort of as a David Harrington Kronos model, you know, sort of a leader band with, with an intention and a vision, which was mine. And, and, after about the first year of working together, where there was, you know, the band began to make some noise very quickly. And, and everybody decided that they wanted to throw down and wanted equal parts of the pie. So sort of regrouped, that band, same personnel, that I had really wanted to play with. And that became known as a group called Ethel. And that, that became known as Ethel in 1999. And then we started at <span style="color:red" data-ts="2929.28" data-end_ts="2929.4" title="2929.28" id=c_"2929.28">__ethos__</span> foundation for the arts and then, in, 2005, they grouped together and sort of UN unceremoniously fired my ass <laugh> so, so they got rid of me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>So that, but that is a group which through those seven years articulated a vision of interdisciplinary. Yeah. And sort of, you know, genre, exploding, whatever you want to use, the, the appropriate word that you wanna use with, with the word genre, we did a lot of great work in, in being sort of the only, you know, there weren't too many quartets besides, you know, Cronos is the model, right. And whatever will be they're my heroes and my friends, but, but there, there weren't that many people. So we sort of wanted to be writing alongside that model and also throwing improvisation <span style="color:red" data-ts="2976.88" data-end_ts="2977.04" title="2976.88" id=c_"2976.88">__and__</span> it mix throwing electronics in the mix and, and visuals and everything else. So, so that, so that, that during that seven years, that was its in that's, it, it was its intention. So that's one group that I have, that's connected to my name and certainly to, you know, the thing that I wanted to create, which got created and was successful then, after that, you know, building another string quartet is superfluous, but I did, but people kept coming to me asking community string quartets because they thought that's what I did. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>So, the Todd Reynold string quartet was around for a while. So, I did, Meredith monks last big project, I believe. I think I, I think it's your last one called songs of Ascension. Okay. I put together a string quartet for that and worked with Meredith for two years. What other groups? Yoyo <span style="color:red" data-ts="3023.32" data-end_ts="3023.52" title="3023.32" id=c_"3023.32">__ma__</span> silk road project. I was one of the, one of the very, very early members of that just when I was getting started, a, an album called when strangers meet. Yes. And what, what an incredible <laugh> opportunity that was. And some of the touring that I did with him also, I actually got to know him because of composer, composer named tan Dunn, which everybody knows for the score of crouching tiger, hidden dragon. And, I played a, a solo in London with a solo part. It was a violin cello <span style="color:red" data-ts="3054.64" data-end_ts="3054.84" title="3054.64" id=c_"3054.64">__cons__</span> concerto with a corral, which played stones and then three water percussionist. It was the <span style="color:red" data-ts="3060.8" data-end_ts="3060.92" title="3060.8" id=c_"3060.8">__St__</span>. Matthew passion. It was called a water passion. Okay. So that's where I met yoyo and then ended up doing those first few tours, with the silk Grove project. I'm trying to think of other other ensembles. It's, it's weird after a long time in life and you go from one thing to another things blur quite a bit, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But there's well, in addition, in addition to doing ensembles, you've also done a tremendous number of collaboration. So every time I've seen you work, it's always been in conjunction with Luke <span style="color:red" data-ts="3096.74" data-end_ts="3096.96" title="3096.74" id=c_"3096.74">__DWA__</span> doing visuals with you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Which was a really pretty incredible combo because Luke's stuff, it, he found a way to, again, in a very interesting way, sort of like react off of you while you're playing. And I got the sense that you were reacting off of him as he was messing around. And it was a really powerful, collaboration, more so than just a typical thing where a visual artist kind of pops down next to a guy and then runs his, runs his <span style="color:red" data-ts="3133.89" data-end_ts="3134.24" title="3133.89" id=c_"3133.89">__stick__</span>, you know, while the music plays, but you have done other collaborations over the years, too. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>None as much as with Luke. I mean, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, Luke thing is a pretty long <span style="color:red" data-ts="3145.4" data-end_ts="3145.68" title="3145.4" id=c_"3145.4">__form__</span>. Yeah. You've been doing that for a long time. Yeah. I've seen you like do the thing with him and it was like a five year spread in between 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Performances. Right? Right. The, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3154.7" data-end_ts="3154.92" title="3154.7" id=c_"3154.7">__no__</span>, the Luke, the Luke thing is very special partially because Luke is special partially cuz our relationship is special, but it's it's actually, Luke thing still has a ton of room for growth in this, in this way. For instance, Luke, Luke <span style="color:red" data-ts="3172.75" data-end_ts="3173.04" title="3172.75" id=c_"3172.75">__does__</span> Luke specializes and he talks about this all the time. His intent as a visual artist, working in collaboration is to amplify the presence of the performer. So sometimes he uses cameras with me. Sometimes he uses line drawings, sometimes it's, photographs, whatever. But if the idea of, of amplifying the presence of the performance, which is perfect for this thing that we now call concert theater. Right. But in this way that we've worked together, I've never done the rear view mirror or the, or the external monitor. So I was really watching him cuz everybody's going on behind. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. You don't, you don't. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>I have not done that. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3209.38" data-end_ts="3209.6" title="3209.38" id=c_"3209.38">__Oh__</span>, that's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Unreal. I would've, I would've bet dollars to donuts that you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Were. Right. Right. But the reason that is, is because Luke is listening, Luke's computer is listening to every, every note that comes outta my violin. So of course there's that connection. So, so I mean, in a way I, and I, I don't want to get to end <span style="color:red" data-ts="3230.64" data-end_ts="3230.72" title="3230.64" id=c_"3230.64">__of__</span> my life not having explored this more with him, you know, because that is something we can do relatively easy. It feels, I don't want to use the word cop out, but it just feels like, it feels like, like, like there's more we can do <span style="color:red" data-ts="3243.35" data-end_ts="3243.64" title="3243.35" id=c_"3243.35">__sure__</span>. You know, Luke and I can do together where I, where I am responding to him. Right. And so completing the loop, completing, completing the loop, the problem is that Luke's work is so beautiful and so well thought out that it's enough, just the way it is, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So well, and to what extent do you actually like worry about the idea? So I, for a while I did performances in planetariums Uhhuh, and I had to just literally learn to ignore the fact that there was anything going on because especially in planetarium where stuff is going on 360 over your head, it's really easy to, to get so entrance by what you're seeing, you forgot you're supposed to be playing. And all of a sudden this horrible silence 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Comes over the <span style="color:red" data-ts="3285.16" data-end_ts="3285.36" title="3285.16" id=c_"3285.16">__road__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And it's a little disturbing for everyone. Right, right, right. I mean, do you, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Well, I haven't ever had to learn. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="3291.63" data-end_ts="3291.92" title="3291.63" id=c_"3291.63">__Yeah__</span>. You 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Never <span style="color:red" data-ts="3292.37" data-end_ts="3292.72" title="3292.37" id=c_"3292.37">__cause__</span> I'm facing forward. And I'm trying, because it's my duty to connect with the audience. Right. That's true. But there are times when we've been performing, when all of a sudden I'll wheel around and I will look at what's going on on the screen behind me and I will, and I will absolutely respond to that for a little bit. And then I'll have to go back to what I'm doing. So it's like, you know, once again, like Luke and I have never rehearsed a day in our lives, so we appear, we show up and he's set up in about two minutes and I'm set up in 20 minutes and then, you know, and then we make sure that everything works. But I'm, I love working with dancers. I love making stuff up because when I'm making stuff up, then, then I really am reacting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Right. And, and somebody leaps and I can, and I can do something to, to support that. Or somebody begins something new and I can do something to support that because my toolkit given to me by max and, and Ableton live, my toolkit gives me 24 to 25 options to do at any moment. So, so in that way, that real time stuff, I never get lost there because I've got a few foot pedals and at least with that, I can, I can set something in motion, which changes the whole landscape of what's going on so I can follow a through line. So I guess if you were, you were really asking about the visual thing <span style="color:red" data-ts="3373.98" data-end_ts="3374.2" title="3373.98" id=c_"3373.98">__or__</span> the in relationship with the planetarium thing, that would be the same thing. Yeah. Except that watching TV is different than watching a live person who's making. Right. You know, know like real, tangible, physical decisions right. In front of your face. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That's, that's actually quite intimidating when you're doing doing that because you do something and you see the reaction, all of a sudden you understand the responsibility that you have 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Right. At the moment. Right. You know, well, you know, I mean, improvisation is this wonderful, metaphor for life where each person who is an improviser and this is, you'll see this so powerfully in the whole John Z <span style="color:red" data-ts="3411.07" data-end_ts="3411.36" title="3411.07" id=c_"3411.07">__camp__</span> and like mark Rebo and all those Elliot sharp and all those guys, everybody is making as powerful of choices as if they were completely alone. Yeah. It's like, like EV it's like, it's in the way, like you mentioned the wild, wild west, every man for himself, with the consideration 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Of every other man there 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b><laugh> right. So it's like, if I'm working, if I'm working with a, with a bunch of dancers in order to leap, that's a powerful dis choice. You don't change that in the middle. Right. So you have to make that choice and I have to make my choice and then you have to deal with the outcome. Sure. And, and that's sort of a wonderful place. That's sort of a wonderful place to be because everybody's living their most powerful selves without having a conversation about what the dangers of the outcome might be. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>There's no risk adversity there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So you've gone from a person who does, who, who started off, with reproduction, and expansion of Preco <span style="color:red" data-ts="3472.96" data-end_ts="3473.12" title="3472.96" id=c_"3472.96">__compos__</span> information being what it sounds like to me pretty much completely embedded in the improvisational world. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I mean, it started out with my inspiration, my, my fundamental inspiration was Jimmy Hendrix. Okay. <laugh>, you know, and, and I didn't even, and even looking back at it now, I didn't really understand what that meant. Right. Sure. But the fact that, that somebody could make that much noise and that saturated of sound and that, that beauty, you know, and then the next thing was, the next thing was Steve <span style="color:red" data-ts="3503.56" data-end_ts="3503.8" title="3503.56" id=c_"3503.56">__rice__</span>, which was not electronic, but sure. Sounded like it. Sure. Sound like dance music before dance music 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Happened. Well, you, listen, you listen to, to <span style="color:red" data-ts="3511" data-end_ts="3511.28" title="3511" id=c_"3511">__Steve__</span> Reich. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3511.64" data-end_ts="3511.8" title="3511.64" id=c_"3511.64">__And__</span> there are so many ways that things that we now imagine as like a filter sweep, that was a composed movement through the orchestra of the different harmonic content of the instruments, right. By sweeping 'em in a certain way. Right. You could get a certain thing or you, you get the slow movement through a, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Like on a she, to, to tos Don, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3534.48" data-end_ts="3534.64" title="3534.48" id=c_"3534.48">__wanna__</span> roll in for instance, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Or you get this smeared, movement through a cord or key change by having it based off of a performance movement instead of being a, a pre-written change, you know, in a timed piece. I mean, so many of those things now sort of translate into things that we think of as sort of like synthesized tones, right. I would say probably half of the people that are gonna hear this, this podcast will have come to music through something like, you know, band in school or Suzuki method or whatever, and started off with the prepo work, but a large number of people. And particularly from the non-professional world come from pretty much everything's improvisational. And nothing's really pre <span style="color:red" data-ts="3584.6" data-end_ts="3585" title="3584.6" id=c_"3584.6">__scored__</span> because even if it was scored, they might not know how to read it or might not choose to ever learn how to read it. What do you see as the benefits of each side of it? And how would you suggest that people take a taste of the other side? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Oh my God. That's like the best question ever asked, not to like, not to like, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3609.18" data-end_ts="3609.4" title="3609.18" id=c_"3609.18">__pat__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3609.46" data-end_ts="3609.68" title="3609.46" id=c_"3609.46">__you__</span> on their head too much. Wow. That's a beautiful, because that goes to the essence of like, what music is today. So I, so I came up with rigor, lots of discipline and rigor, and my childhood was noticeably absent of the concept of play mm-hmm <affirmative>, it was much more about rigor and I paid for that in hours and hours and hours of therapy. So there's, there's something that is really gained by that. You know, I have, I have an, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3637.48" data-end_ts="3637.6" title="3637.48" id=c_"3637.48">__a__</span>, an ability at my craft of playing the violin, which, which serves me well, it's a little it without meaning to sound, cavalier about this. I really don't mean it like this, but playing the violin itself after you've been doing it for 46 years is a little bit like brushing your teeth. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Mm-hmm <affirmative>, you know, where the toothbrush goes, you know what, you, you know what to, you know, I don't wanna get too oral about this, but <laugh>, but, you know, but, but it's just, you know, it's something you do every day. So it's like when I pick up the violin and I wanna express an idea, it is not difficult for me to express that idea or to find an idea to express. Sure. So that's a real benefit to the rigor that I've been through and all the conservatory education and the music, history learning and all that stuff, man, I would not give that back at all. I feel fortunate to have it, by the same token, when I decided that I wanted to branch out past that there was all, there was, there were periods of rejection of what I had learned, periods where I really had this struggle to say, well, if I'm going to make that sound, if I'm gonna really play a blues note and sound authentic, if I'm going to try to play the blues, that there's a level of authenticity from having been in that world that I cannot ignore. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Right. Like I cannot be in <span style="color:red" data-ts="3715.76" data-end_ts="3715.88" title="3715.76" id=c_"3715.76">__a__</span>, be a stupid approximator. And so instead I have to really, really dig down and really give up some of the things I learned, you know, and not have them be as important. And then right on the heels of that, it's like, oh my God, I'm losing my technique. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Geez. You know, don't, don't ask, don't ask me to travel with the <span style="color:red" data-ts="3735.08" data-end_ts="3735.36" title="3735.08" id=c_"3735.08">__Seva__</span> violin concerto, because it's gonna take me a year to pull up. It's not gonna be, be that rewarding for me. And halfway through it, I'm gonna curse myself or having done it. I'm not the guy I was 20 years ago. Right. So it's like, there's, there's a very, there's a very complex thing that goes on here. When you, when you open yourself up past what you know, to have been your norm. So that's so, so that can be complex, very rewarding in the end, but it takes something, this is the same thing with religion, with sexuality, with any, any of the things that we go through as human beings, where we progress past what we know and open ourselves to something new, right. There's always that path. So in a way it's normal and I shouldn't make too much of a big deal out of it. On the other hand, well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Except you should, because the fact of the matter is we don't always treat there's, there's this sense that music is somehow like this special thing. And it's treated like much with much more respect than sexuality or, you know, or religion or any of these other things it's somehow magical and mystical because there's this, ethereal talent thing and this, and this hard work aspect to it, that somehow seems to be more reverence than anything else. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Right. Right. And, and, and when you see, when, when you're not in that group, then you look at it with that mysticism. Right. Right, right. It's, it's funny because it's the same. If you take a look at woodworking, it's the same there's craft and there's art now, hopefully when you're studying the woodworking, you are studying craft and art at the same time. If you have a good teacher, that's probably gonna Mel a little bit. Right. And then you're going to come out with your own unique expression. And then, you know, other people, all the critics get to judge whether it's art or not <laugh>. But, but, but I don't buy that. I, I buy <span style="color:red" data-ts="3844.72" data-end_ts="3844.92" title="3844.72" id=c_"3844.72">__artist__</span> practice. Yeah. So I'm not of the camp that says it's it's for the intelligence you to decide what's art or not. No, let's take it away from that. Art is in your hands, whether you want to practice art, then, then, then you can, then you are an artist and you are practicing art. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>So, so the craft and the art of music is, is the same thing. Can <span style="color:red" data-ts="3867.42" data-end_ts="3867.64" title="3867.42" id=c_"3867.42">__it__</span>, it's sort of <span style="color:red" data-ts="3868.28" data-end_ts="3868.56" title="3868.28" id=c_"3868.28">__tight__</span>, tightly interwoven, and it is mystical and it's not mystical wherever. There's a paradox. That's for me where the truth is, right. You know, where both things that seem opposite can occur at the same time, down deep in there. If you drill, that's where your insight comes and that's where you find yourself, that's where you find your truth. If there is any truth to be had. So on the other side of that, you asked about the, how, you know, taste of the other world. So let's say that you, you came to music when you were 17 years old and you came to it through a mash up where you, you went to a friend's house and he said, let me show you what I've done. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>And he's got the crossfader UN Ableton live enabled, and, and he's got two tunes, and he's just going between these, these two tunes. And you're like, oh my God, how do you separate that James Brown drum beat from, you know, the Bernard Purdy lick from this. And, and how do you combine and <span style="color:red" data-ts="3919.32" data-end_ts="3919.44" title="3919.32" id=c_"3919.32">__you__</span>, and your mind gets blown with technology. Well, you have just set yourself on a path. <laugh>. Now I do not believe that you need to read music to go further down that path. When you come to the point, when you're on that path, where you're saying, wow, I'd like to really do this live rather than doing it in a box, in a software package. And I'd like to be able to wave my hands like those guys who call themselves conductors do and have one side of the orchestra take over this job. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>And once <span style="color:red" data-ts="3956.1" data-end_ts="3956.32" title="3956.1" id=c_"3956.1">__say__</span> at that point, you've got a whole new world that just opened up to you of both pain and pleasure, where, where you really do need to know something about notation and about how those people understand their music. So, so the best way to get a taste of the other world, just like anything else is to begin to expand your network and to begin to be friends with and interested parties and interested collaborators with people who don't do something different than you. People who have a different type of discipline. The person who is sort of fly by night experiment with this experiment, with that sort of, you know, this might take a longer time for that person. And that's okay too, because making art is making art. And so that person, you know, may not be as serious about it. You may not ever need to touch anything else, except just the tools that you're playing with. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>But, and, and I have, I have so much room for those people. I mean, <span style="color:red" data-ts="4018.47" data-end_ts="4018.76" title="4018.47" id=c_"4018.47">__this__</span>, they aren't, those people they're us. <span style="color:red" data-ts="4020.67" data-end_ts="4020.96" title="4020.67" id=c_"4020.67">__They__</span>, we are, we're, it's just different, different expressions of the same thing. So I guess O obviously I do less good of a, of an impression of, of like coming from the other side, cuz I don't know that other side, but I do see people, I do meet people who've sort of started from that side, from the electronic side who aren't that skilled at they're instruments, you know, and a guy who walks in and he's playing theso, doesn't play the bassoon very well, but he really, he really thinks that, you know, he wants to play Theo and, and make his music out of theso. And at that point, you know, I hear all these other wonderful things he's doing. And I'm like, you know, you either gotta, ever get really good at playing the bassoon or start looking at these other things that, that make you happy. Right? These other types of music that you can make without Theo in your hand. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, Todd, it's been a fantastic opportunity to talk with you. As so often with these interviews, I start talking and it seems like I, I got the rest of the day. Let's keep, but I really appreciate you taking out the time. Thanks for touching based while you're visiting in fabulous Denver. I hope you're having a 
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>With you. Yeah, it is. This is awesome. So thanks a lot. And we're gonna talk, talk some more soon, right on maybe I'll come out to your neck of the woods for the, oh, please 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Do. Please do. All right. Thanks a lot. Thanks so much. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And there's another podcast podcast.
