<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, today I have the great pleasure of getting to meet somebody new for me. His name is Phil McGuire. I first ran across his work in a recent issue of the Vital Weekly, email letter where they kind of introduce you to a lot of recent releases of kind of experimental and interesting music. I have a tendency to go through their thing and read and listen, and I kind of, this caught my ear in a big way. And so then I went out and I ran across a interviewee that he did and some, of his other work. And I just have really, I've fallen in love with his work. And so I was really anxious to reach out to him. We got a chance to to get a conversation started. And with that, I will get a chance to say hello to Phil McGuire. Hey, Phil, how are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Phil Maguire: </b>Hey, Darwin. I'm very well. Thank you for having me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, thanks a lot for, taking time outta your schedule to spend, spend some time with us. So I just babbled on about a bunch of things that I just tripped over that are yours, but why don't I have you, kind of explain what some of your most recent work is like, or what are some of the things you've been doing lately? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Phil: </b>Okay. So most recently I've been this, suppose there's been kind of three strands to what I've been doing recently. One of those is improvising, three improvisation, solo and with other musicians with a small electronic setup. The other thing would be composing electronic music. So maybe the piece you heard or the piece you saw in the Vital Weekly newsletter was, is quite indicative of that kind of thing. Kind of though <span style="color:red" data-ts="108.005" data-end_ts="108.125" title="108.005" id=c_"108.005">__a__</span> case reductive, a little bit droney kind of things. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="112.325" data-end_ts="112.525" title="112.325" id=c_"112.325">__the__</span> other thing I've been doing most recently is playing around with kind of obsolete, and damaged, audio equipment. Anything I can, anything I find basically that I can get my hands on, I'll play around with and, kind of let it do what it wants to do and, record that and see if I can make anything vaguely musical out of it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So exactly what, I mean, are you talking about like tape decks or amplifiers or like broken speakers or lab gear or what kind of stuff? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Phil: </b>It's usually things I find at my day <span style="color:red" data-ts="147.205" data-end_ts="147.405" title="147.205" id=c_"147.205">__job__</span>. I'm a arts technician at a university, so I kind of deal with a lot of, you know, zoom recorders, and old tape decks that I might find in store rooms and stuff when we're <span style="color:red" data-ts="158.485" data-end_ts="158.565" title="158.485" id=c_"158.485">__di__</span> you know, digitizing <span style="color:red" data-ts="159.405" data-end_ts="159.605" title="159.405" id=c_"159.405">__our__</span> archive and a lot of that stuff, you know, through wear and tear can be become damaged. So in the course of trying to fix this equipment, I'll play around with it and see if there are any quirks that might be useful, in an artistic sense. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's really interesting. What are the kinds of things that you actually run across? What are, I mean, is it just like things will start glitching in a useful way or do you get a cool distortion, or is there stuff that just is left field sounds 
</p>

<p>
<b>Phil: </b>In terms of the, the hardware? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, in terms of what, what you hear as a result? Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Phil: </b>Okay. Well, yeah, I think most of what happens, it'd be some kind of distortion, especially, with these, zoom recorders, the ones I've used, they seem to have, when they get past a certain age, they seem to seemingly out of nowhere produce kind of white noise. It's a very kind of interesting, very rich kind of white noise. It's a lot of peaks and troughs and I dunno what's going on in the circuitry or, or anything. But, it's something I find very interesting. So I've made, I've made quite a few recordings of that kind of thing. And with the tape decks, it's quite, it's more or less what you would expect, you know, not playing things back at certain speeds or the squeak of the spindles, you know, coming out in the, when you record digitizer tape or something. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well it's kind of interesting because it's sort of like working with circuit bent, tools, except they were kind of inadvertently circuit bent, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Phil: </b><laugh>, yeah. I guess you could say that. Yeah. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So I, I was lucky enough before this to I also reached out to you for the Cycling 74 newsletter to talk to you, in that regard. And so you provided some information that was helpful for me to get some background. And one of the things you pointed to was this, I'm hesitant to call it a salsa band, so it's, we'll just say a Latin styled band called Arcadio. But it's a really, it's got a really unique sound because not only do you have a synth player, but you're not even the synth player. You're just listed as electronics. And when you listen to it, it's a very interesting mix of like very trad Latin sounds with very cool and almost experimental electronic sounds. How did you, how did that even come up as an opportunity for you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Phil: </b>So Arcadia is, a band, the kind of main mastermind of, of the band is my friend, Andy Hall. He's a composer from London. He's originally a trumpet player, so I think he's, you know, kind of got a lot of this music kind of ingrained in his background, right. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="322.805" data-end_ts="322.965" title="322.805" id=c_"322.805">__has__</span> been playing with various kind <span style="color:red" data-ts="324.085" data-end_ts="324.125" title="324.085" id=c_"324.085">__of__</span> jazzy Latin combinations of stuff for a long time. He approached me, must have been 18 months, two years ago now when I was getting, you know, when I was really starting to find, what I was interested in, in terms of found sound and glitchy textural noise kind of, material in my own work. And he said, I'm putting together this Latin band. I want it to have a really strong electronic component, but I don't want you to do anything rhythmic. Was kind of paraphrasing what he said slightly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Phil: </b>But, he came to me and he very specifically said that he wanted me to do textural stuff. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, which I thought would be quite an interesting challenge because a lot of Latin music is so locked into, you know, these rhythmic patterns and <span style="color:red" data-ts="369.845" data-end_ts="370.045" title="369.845" id=c_"369.845">__<inaudible>__</span> and all this kind of thing. Right. So to, so to have a role that it's specifically non <span style="color:red" data-ts="374.885" data-end_ts="375.365" title="374.885" id=c_"374.885">__rhythmic__</span> in that, that's something I didn't wanna pass up, really. It's just, for me, it's one of those things where I can just turn up and make a racket and it's just, yeah. It's just a ton of fun that bands 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, anytime you have the chance to make a racket, how, how that's gotta be awesome. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Phil: </b>You've gotta say yes to it. Yeah. You 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Have to say yes to it. Right. If we talk about the music that I first ran into of yours, what you call your composed work, it very much is, it's kind of droney, but not exactly droney. It's sort of like lowercase glitchy, but not exactly glitchy. But what it is is a lot of times it's very quiet and <span style="color:red" data-ts="414.745" data-end_ts="414.965" title="414.745" id=c_"414.745">__con__</span> contemplative. Right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, I'm curious what is, what is the influence or what, what drew you to that? Because I don't think that was always your music. I think if I go back a ways, I actually run across things that are a lot noisier and more intense, but it seems like you've been moving towards this very slow and quiet kind of sound. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Phil: </b>Yeah. I think, I think it's, something that maybe happened in stages, actually in the, the answers that I gave you for the newsletter, the Cycling 74 newsletter. I kind of talk about it a little bit by nature, I'm quite a quiet person and I like simple things. So I think that feeds into it a little bit. You know, maybe having one or two, sound sources and really exploring what you can do with them over this course of 15, 20, 30, 35 minutes, however long. So maybe, you know, partly my disposition comes into it a bit. But I think the main trigger for it perhaps would be when I was an undergraduate studying, in London, I was part of a student ensemble that performed with Phil <span style="color:red" data-ts="485.615" data-end_ts="485.775" title="485.615" id=c_"485.615">__Ni__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="485.775" data-end_ts="486.015" title="485.775" id=c_"485.775">__Block__</span>, and I'd never heard any of his music before. I remember there was, it was kind of a three <span style="color:red" data-ts="490.375" data-end_ts="490.575" title="490.375" id=c_"490.375">__day__</span> thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Phil: </b>There was the rehearsal on the Monday, a gig at the university on Tuesday, and then a gig at, cafe Otto in London, which is now this huge venue Right. On the Wednesday. So we, we all went in on the Monday with no kind of preconceptions beyond, it's kind of long tones. It's easy and it's fun with how it was <span style="color:red" data-ts="508.535" data-end_ts="508.735" title="508.535" id=c_"508.535">__felt__</span> to me. And we played this music and it blew my mind almost immediately. It kind of sounds very cliche, but when I heard you hear all this, 'cause it's so dense, <span style="color:red" data-ts="517.515" data-end_ts="517.735" title="517.515" id=c_"517.515">__his__</span> music and all the kind of very gradual microtonal shifts. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Phil: </b>I was kind of blown away by just the, the huge complexity within that. It was the first time I experienced, you know, microtonal music, drone music, really psychoacoustics, I guess it was probably the first time I started, you know, experiencing psychoacoustic things firsthand. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> before that I kind of played, I played bass <span style="color:red" data-ts="542.725" data-end_ts="542.885" title="542.725" id=c_"542.725">__and__</span> guitar and pop bands. And doing that, you end up playing with a lot of very showoffy people. So for me it was really refreshing to have this music that was this one very clear idea, with a huge complexity inside that. And I think from there, that was maybe, no, that was about six years ago. And I think I'm still unpacking in my head my experience of that. Yeah. I think it made me realize that having one very clear idea and then really focusing in on it can be something very rewarding is kind of a bit of a good way of putting it, but you know what I mean, like Yeah. Well, so it's satisfying, you know what I mean? Yeah. Very satisfying 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Satisfaction in it. Right. Yeah. Well, there's also something, I don't know, an awful lot of times it took me a long time to get into drone <span style="color:red" data-ts="589.675" data-end_ts="589.965" title="589.675" id=c_"589.675">__like__</span> music. It was, my friend Wally actually introduced me to some, and at first I was just like, well, it's really easy not to do anything for 40 minutes. Right. <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Phil: </b>For 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Yeah. Yeah. And then, as I allowed myself to relax and instead of having like the busy mind and listening for, you know, what's the new change gonna be? Instead of, allowing myself to kind of float into it, it really allowed me to, all of a sudden open my mind. And when I talk to other people about this experience, and when I talk to other people about their engagement <span style="color:red" data-ts="627.035" data-end_ts="627.315" title="627.035" id=c_"627.035">__with__</span> drone, like musics or long form music, people often talk about it using the same kind of wording that they use when they're talking about like psychedelic drug trips or stuff like that. That there's this like, mind expanding thing like you just said. There's, I mean, it's still affecting you years later, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Phil: </b>Yeah. Yeah. I, yeah, I'm not sure how much I think it's along a similar line to some kind of psychedelic thing, but it is, yeah. It was maybe the first time I experienced a kind of complete immersion in something. Sure. Yeah. You know, where the music starts, this is it, you're in it and you go with it for however long the piece is Right. And then you come out of it. That for me, was far more rewarding and actually a lot more interesting than, you know, pop arranging and song form and that kind, you know, scales. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's three and a half minute song form. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Phil: </b>Exactly. Yeah. This, this one kind of very rich environment was infinitely more interesting to me than any of that. I think maybe when I say I'm <span style="color:red" data-ts="699.995" data-end_ts="700.235" title="699.995" id=c_"699.995">__truck__</span>, still trying to work out what I think of that, I think it's mostly just trying to think critically about why I'm more drawn to on the surface simple things than more complex things maybe. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, let's, let's talk a little bit about that. And, and particularly one of the things I like doing in my podcast is talking to people about their background and kind of where they're coming from in as they became artists. Can you fill me in a little bit about what your journey was like? I am, I'm really curious because again, you, you seem open to so many things and willing to try a lot of things, but also doing a lot of introspection. And I'm curious what your background is that puts you in a place to feel free to do that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Phil: </b>Hmm. I mean, yeah, my background's, I've been playing music I guess in some form or <span style="color:red" data-ts="757.005" data-end_ts="757.205" title="757.005" id=c_"757.005">__another__</span> since I was about 12. So around 15, 16 years. I had about a year of guitar lessons when I was six, but, I don't feel like that made much of an impression 'cause I don't remember too much of it. But I started playing bass, electric bass when I was about 12 and played that through school up until about four or five years ago. And then picked up the guitar a bit later. So I was playing in bands and, you know, messing around with friends. There was kind of, at that time you, when you're a teenager, you're kind of ex you are discovering all this kind of music as well. A lot of my friends at the time were into classic rock, you know, Zeppelin and all those guys. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Phil: </b>And that never did anything for me. There was something about it. I don't know what it was. I still don't <span style="color:red" data-ts="801.765" data-end_ts="801.845" title="801.765" id=c_"801.765">__know__</span>. I just, I just not my thing at all. I don't, I don't really get it. So I think maybe <span style="color:red" data-ts="808.085" data-end_ts="808.205" title="808.085" id=c_"808.085">__a__</span> slightly <span style="color:red" data-ts="808.505" data-end_ts="808.725" title="808.505" id=c_"808.505">__end__</span> in response to that, <span style="color:red" data-ts="809.565" data-end_ts="809.685" title="809.565" id=c_"809.565">__I__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="809.685" data-end_ts="809.845" title="809.685" id=c_"809.685">__tr__</span> I kind of had to figure out, well, what did I like? Because this was, so, this was surrounding me all the time. All my friends were into it and my dad was listening to Yes. And weather report and stuff. And none of it, none of it did anything for me. And actually when I was playing Bass <laugh>, my other bass playing friends weren't happy when I said I wasn't a Jacko fan. Yeah, kind of exploring more when I was a teenager, what kind of music I was into, because so much of what the people around me were into didn't appeal. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Phil: </b>And that, I think from there I kind of got a lot into like, indie rock, the kind of, you remember all those British bands from like, kind of 2005, 2006 at Block Party and Libertine and stuff kind of. Oh, sure. Right. Very kind of, for me it was, I always thought their music sounded quite thin in comparison to, you know, classic rock and stuff, you know? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> guitars <span style="color:red" data-ts="862.485" data-end_ts="862.685" title="862.485" id=c_"862.485">__was__</span> like, not many effects and thin sounding drums and stuff. And I, I really liked that. It was very, it sounded very fresh to me, I guess. Right. So I got, I got very into that. That was when I was living in the south of England. I moved to Scotland after I left school to study a pop music diploma at like a community college. And I, I studied with a bunch of, really amazing musicians who, who'd been in all these, you know, they played in the Proclaimers <span style="color:red" data-ts="887.345" data-end_ts="887.565" title="887.345" id=c_"887.345">__and__</span> Aztec camera and you know, name a big Scottish band from the eighties and nineties they played in them, you know? Right. That kind of opened my mind a bit more in terms of playing more professionally. A lot of what they were doing was, I suppose, training you in a way, partly at least partly to be like a session guy. So I think that opened me up a bit more in terms of, well, if you're playing this music kind of more as employment for me, I, you have to find something enjoyable about it, otherwise it just becomes tedious, you know? Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Phil: </b>Yeah. There's not too much more to say about that. I played in a few bands, you know, I just kind of straight ahead pop songs, which is fun. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>At this, at this school, did you end up, you said that they were kind of training <span style="color:red" data-ts="927.265" data-end_ts="927.485" title="927.265" id=c_"927.265">__you__</span> to be a session player. Was it more about the playing or did you spend a lot of time in the studio while you were at school? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Phil: </b>It was more about the playing. You know, you'd, you'd go in with your instrument and say, right, I'm gonna play, I play bass. That's what I want to do. You'd have your one-on-One Lessons, and you'd have your, your band, your performance class where you'd, you know, make a band with some of your classmates. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Phil: </b>Right. Work on some songs and arrangements and stuff. And you'd also work on the business side of it. We did a lot of that. Which now is all redundant because that was, right before 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Facebook, <span style="color:red" data-ts="960.245" data-end_ts="960.365" title="960.245" id=c_"960.245">__a__</span> completely different business. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Phil: </b>Yeah. It was about, I honestly, I left, I left all that about a year before Twitter and Facebook and all this online stuff really exploded. So it's all redundant now, which is quite odd thinking back on it. Yeah. And that kind of always just going on in the background after a couple of years of that, I suppose. But I got into kind of instrumental kind of post rock stuff. I remember one band I really nerded out on was Explosions in the Sky, and maybe for a similar reason as that the nib block, this kind of big sound. And it suited me, you know, you could start a band, but you don't have to sing, you don't have to have someone who's like, you know, a singer and super confident at the front. Right. I went to see them at the Barrel <span style="color:red" data-ts="999.365" data-end_ts="999.685" title="999.365" id=c_"999.365">__Lands__</span> in Glasgow, that's kind of famous rock venue. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Phil: </b>And a guy called Alluvium was opening, and usually at the time I'd skip support bands and stuff, but I, I went along to see this guy 'cause I was early basically, and he played this really gorgeous guitar loop, instrumental swell repeating pattern kind of thing. And that kind of blew me away a bit. 'cause I hadn't experienced, that was the first time I'd experienced anything like that. You know, someone playing an electric guitar, but just stood by themselves. They had had like a looper and a couple of things. So that kind of, that, that impressed me. Had a big impression on me. So I spent a few years after that making not too bad guitar Loop music, but it became formulate very quick. So I did that for a couple of years and then moved back to England, went to London for university, and then was doing all this, but at the same time being introduced to, you know, Steve Rice and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1053.535" data-end_ts="1053.885" title="1053.535" id=c_"1053.535">__Rinky__</span>, Booles Schuberg, all the huge 20th century guys. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Phil: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So it kind of, it became very soy for me. I think. I dunno, I feel like talking about it now, I feel like there's always, there's always been a thread of, there's been lots of stuff, music stuff. I've always been at least aware of it, even if I wasn't interested in it. So I think I've kind of, as much as I hate Yes. From my dad's endless hours of listening to it, I think that might have opened me up a bit. It kind of set me off searching because I, I knew I didn't like that, so I had to go find what I did like, you know. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well I think that, I think that the process of making, you know, an individual's taste is a lot more complex than just saying, well, I listened to this until I loved it. Right. I do think that there's a pretty significant component of saying, well, I listened to this and I really didn't love it. Or conversely, I got bombarded by this thing and I never want to hear it again. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Phil: </b><laugh>. Yeah. Yeah. I'd be quite happy if I didn't hear another Wakeman solo. But at the same time, I think that you can make that a positive thing, you know, because it does make you think critically, sure, I don't like this, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But why didn't I like, like it 
</p>

<p>
<b>Phil: </b>Exactly. You can think, why didn't I like it? So then you can be more informed in searching for what you do, like, you know. Sure, sure. But then, yeah, I kind of, when I was an undergrad, I, I carried on the pop stuff for a bit, but the course I was studying was very much centered around 20th, 21st century and specifically experimental music. That was very freeing for me. That was very freeing. Doing, you know, tech <span style="color:red" data-ts="1146.085" data-end_ts="1146.405" title="1146.085" id=c_"1146.085">__schools__</span>, like what would be some of the tech <span style="color:red" data-ts="1149.245" data-end_ts="1149.445" title="1149.245" id=c_"1149.245">__schools__</span>, stones by Wolf and Harford memory space and that kind of thing. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> The further I went through this course and where I realized that music is all these different things that kept getting wider and wider and wider, and playing pop music became less and less relevant for me. Yeah. And around the same time I did the Nib <span style="color:red" data-ts="1167.805" data-end_ts="1168.005" title="1167.805" id=c_"1167.805">__Block__</span> performance, it might have been the same month actually. I started learning Max in one of my classes, and then I kind of, it all started to come together a bit more in terms of, oh, I kind of like technology and computers and playing around with them, but I still kind of like guitars, so let's see what can happen with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1185.165" data-end_ts="1185.285" title="1185.165" id=c_"1185.165">__them__</span>. Yeah. And from there, it's kind of gone off on its own and snowboarded and bounced around, and now I'm Yeah. Making, I suppose, droney, glitchy, lowercase stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1195.025" data-end_ts="1195.245" title="1195.025" id=c_"1195.025">__So__</span> that's really an interesting trail. And, one of the interesting things to me is thinking about this idea of starting off. 'cause if I think about myself, I, there was a similar track for me, although I'd never really thought of it quite this way, which is when you're situated in the middle of like pop music or some kind of pop music, it seems like there's this huge range. Like, you know, if you're a rock musician, it's like, well, I can go everything from Black Sabbath all the way to Led Zeppelin. Right. <laugh>. And then when you step back <span style="color:red" data-ts="1227.965" data-end_ts="1228.245" title="1227.965" id=c_"1227.965">__five__</span> spaces that looks like a sliver of all of pop music, and then you step back five steps more and pop music is just a sliver of form music and you step back five more spaces, and then experimentalism means that the whole of that structural music is just a sliver. Right? Yeah. But when you were in the middle of it, it just seemed like, oh my God, it's such a big world of all of these great heavy metal bands or whatever. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Phil: </b>Yeah. You suddenly have this explosion in your head, don't you, of oh my God, there's so much more stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So other than, other than Phil, who you actually got to work with directly and hence would be a, a big influence of all the stuff that you've kind of experienced throughout this journey, then what's, 'cause you, you, you used the phrase, you have a lot of music stuff kinda like floating around your head. What are the touch points that really affected you and what was the thing about it that affected you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Phil: </b>Yeah, that's the, that's a good, that's a big question. I think maybe another fill, there's a lot of fill popping up <span style="color:red" data-ts="1292.665" data-end_ts="1292.885" title="1292.665" id=c_"1292.665">__in__</span> musically for me. I, I, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1294.845" data-end_ts="1295.125" title="1294.845" id=c_"1294.845">__realize__</span> <laugh>, I saw <span style="color:red" data-ts="1297.705" data-end_ts="1298.125" title="1297.705" id=c_"1297.705">__Philip__</span> Jack for the first time a few years ago, this experimental turntable guy from England. He releases his stuff on Touch, the Touch Label. So I think I found him through film the Block releasing stuff on the same label. And he builds these very, really gorgeous collages with old turntables of found records and mini <span style="color:red" data-ts="1320.445" data-end_ts="1320.725" title="1320.445" id=c_"1320.445">__disc__</span> recordings of his old gigs and stuff. And he, I remember seeing him in a church in London, there's a lot of these really old churches in very noisy parts of London. So you can have a very interesting experience of music if you see the right people playing in them, you know, and he played, he sits there with this kind of table of junk almost on his table, but he sits very still and kind of moves very slowly and very deliberately and just kind of builds this like really gorgeous kind of sound world. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Phil: </b>Like <span style="color:red" data-ts="1349.525" data-end_ts="1349.685" title="1349.525" id=c_"1349.525">__it__</span> kind of just kind of molds it and reshapes it. And then I met him afterwards and chat to him about it, and he was very modest about it and saying, wait, you know, it's quite simple. I just, you know, put on these records and play them. So it's kind of nice. That was nice for me because it kind of, I think when I was first starting to study these big composers from the 20th century, they almost, by definition they kind of become mythologized. You know, if they revolutionized something they'd become mythologized, these huge towering figures. But then I saw this guy doing something at the time, I'd never seen it or heard anything like that. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So that was cool. But then to meet him afterwards and just to kind of have a chat with a nice normal guy who was very friendly and interested in you as well, and not just kind of, you know, being this, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Being a tower of music history. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Phil: </b>Exactly. Yeah. That kind of, that that humanized it a bit more for me. And I thought, okay, well it, it sounds a bit silly, but it kind of made me think, okay, well maybe I could do this as well. You know? Right. Right. This isn't just something that I write an essay about and then try and emulate for my composition class. You know, this is something that I can, these people are still working and they're still alive and they're happy to chat to you. You know? So it suddenly became a lot more possible Right. To participate in it. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Of course. Of course. Mm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Phil: </b>I don't wanna hang too much just on that one concept, but that's been a kind of recurring thing, especially when I was a student, the kind of openness and willingness of people like <span style="color:red" data-ts="1430.545" data-end_ts="1430.765" title="1430.545" id=c_"1430.545">__the__</span>, all these musicians who you hear and you know, you're blown away by their music, and then you meet them at a geek and they're really lovely and friendly and happy to chat and happy to listen to your sketches and stuff, that kind of thing. That openness has come up again and again for me. And I feel like I'm quite fortunate to have experienced that because in a way I feel like maybe that's allowed me the space to think, okay, well I can just try whatever making an album just out of recordings of broken zoom recorders or whatever, and see how that goes. And if it doesn't work, then it's fine. 'cause you just, you, it's a little experiment and you can move on. I think maybe that openness, when I was younger of meeting people really kind of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1471.885" data-end_ts="1472.085" title="1471.885" id=c_"1471.885">__opened__</span> things up for me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I like that as, as a concept. And I like that as kind of a, as as sort of a way to think about getting an education. Because if you think about it, we go to school for music education and, and you get introduced to certain kinds of things. Right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But a lot of times the instructors in a school are very much, focused on not necessarily having you become Exactly, or like exactly what they like, they want to introduce you into things that, you know, inform you into how to make your own decisions about stuff. Mm-Hmm. Yeah. And it seems like you found a way to also get that out of performers you were seeing. And I think a lot of people don't, a lot of people assume that there's a big gulf between where I am and where the performer is, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1518.065" data-end_ts="1518.285" title="1518.065" id=c_"1518.065">__and__</span> I think that's kind of cool that you just have decided that that's not gonna be a thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Phil: </b>Yeah. And I, I, I dunno what the, whether it's the same in other cities or countries, but in London there'll be a lot of, the good thing about places like Cafe Otto is they are just a cafe. You know, they're just a Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> quite a relatively small room, and there's no stage. It's just a partitioned off part of the room. There's a lot of places like that where the, the venues are very small, physically very small. So when you're at a gig, you can just go, you can, you know, you can walk right up to 'em afterwards. And I don't think I've ever had an experience where I've gone up to a performer after a gig. I don't always, sometimes I, I just, I don't feel like I need to talk to them, you know? But I don't think I've ever had an experience at a gig in London where I've gone up to a performer and they've not been willing to talk about <span style="color:red" data-ts="1568.875" data-end_ts="1569.165" title="1568.875" id=c_"1568.875">__they__</span>, they've never not been willing to have a chat. And that's, yeah. I think that's something that I hope exists in other places, but in London kind of is very, it's a very fortunate thing that venues are quite small. That sounds a bit odd, doesn't it? But you know what I mean, that thing of the, the physical distance is so much less because you're in a small space, so. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And I, it's funny because I think it used to be different here in the States, it used to be a lot more oriented towards these performance venues where there was always a stage and an audience thing. And then, you know, people, I guess if you go back to like folk tradition, there was a lot more where people were just sitting among people, but now, you know, coffee shops are opening themselves up for electronic performances or whatever. Mm-Hmm. And then when the person's done, they kinda stand up and walk over and get a cup of coffee. And it is a wide open opportunity to talk to them. You just have to be willing to imagine that they'd actually want to talk to you too. Yeah, right. Which is maybe sometimes not always easy to do either. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Phil: </b>Yeah. And I, I've found that if it's, especially electronic musicians, the less you talk about their gear, the more that willing they are to talk to you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I agree. That's true. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Phil: </b>Because there's always, who did I see? I was at, I saw Toshi Nakamura the other week, the no input, mixer Japanese guy. He's, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1649.525" data-end_ts="1649.645" title="1649.525" id=c_"1649.525">__well__</span>, I've been into his stuff for a few years now, and that's the first time I got to see him play. He was playing with a tuba player, actually. And after the gig, I didn't go and chat to him, but after the gig, I saw a bunch of people go up straight up to him and start pointing at his mixer <span style="color:red" data-ts="1663.965" data-end_ts="1664.085" title="1663.965" id=c_"1663.965">__and__</span> his pedals and go, oh, what does that do? What does that do? What does that do? <laugh>? And I, I'm sure to a point he's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1668.685" data-end_ts="1668.765" title="1668.685" id=c_"1668.685">__happy__</span> to talk about it, but as someone who's not interested in gear, I find that, you know, not something really that worth talking about. Yeah. And actually a, a friend of mine who plays, he makes kind of, he's a songwriter, but he makes very kind of atmospheric music. He bought a Moog, one of the Bass Moog <span style="color:red" data-ts="1686.585" data-end_ts="1686.805" title="1686.585" id=c_"1686.585">__sub__</span>, Syns, and he said his, for about six months afterwards, everyone would come to his gigs and the first thing they would say was, oh, hey man, your Moog sounds great, <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Phil: </b>Not I liked your songs. Or, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1700.055" data-end_ts="1700.405" title="1700.055" id=c_"1700.055">__Right__</span>. Or even, you sound great. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Phil: </b>Exactly. Your Moog sounds great, <laugh>. And I think that, I feel like it's okay, maybe the Moog does sound great, but it's kind of a bit of an easy thing to go to. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well it is a, I mean, there is, it's amazing that music gear is something that has become such a, such a, a fetish thing and Mm-Hmm. I have to admit that I, I have my fetishism for the gear, ebbs and flows over time. And there have been times when I've gotten pretty obsessed with it as well. But it is interesting that unlike, well, you know, I was gonna say unlike power tools or whatever, but I think maybe it's just like, it, it, one of the things I would say is a lot of the gear obsession tends to be really male oriented also, and maybe it's, maybe it's just a male genetic thing, right. Where it's like, whatever you do, you have to make sure that you're competing with everybody else to see like, who's got the coolest table saw or something. I dunno, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Phil: </b><laugh>. Yeah. Yeah. It's exactly that, isn't it? Yeah. Like the, the classic guitar shop scene of everyone's kind of squaring off, you know? Right, right. But who knows <span style="color:red" data-ts="1771.525" data-end_ts="1771.685" title="1771.525" id=c_"1771.525">__the__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1771.685" data-end_ts="1771.845" title="1771.685" id=c_"1771.685">__most__</span> about bowels or whatever, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Right. Unreal. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Phil: </b>I just, I dunno, I'm just not interested in it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, good for you. I think that's great. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Phil: </b>I, I mean, that's not to say that, gear is worthless. I can, I have a lot of respect actually for people who spend the time and the money actually putting together a set of really high quality equipment. Like this friend of mine, with the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1793.285" data-end_ts="1793.485" title="1793.285" id=c_"1793.285">__move__</span>, he spent a lot of time buying and selling equipment to find stuff that will help him make the music he wants to make. Right. I think that's quite a healthy way of approaching <span style="color:red" data-ts="1801.885" data-end_ts="1802.045" title="1801.885" id=c_"1801.885">__gi__</span>. But I think maybe growing up I encountered so many people that only bought the X because Y played it, or, you know, because there was a certain kind of valve in it. It just seemed very kind of a bit academic. Yeah. And a bit, a bit, I don't know, collectively. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Perhaps. Right. Yeah, very much. And you said something earlier that I really wanna dive into a little bit because I think it's related to what makes you kind of peculiar in the music that you're doing. You said that, when you kind of got into doing loops and guitar loop things that you felt like it was kind of successful, but it also became formulaic after a while. And I guess I've noticed noticed that as a real easy thing to fall into when you start doing looping stuff, particularly looping stuff. But I'm curious, what is it that, in your mind, are the formulaic traps, and what are the things that you do when you're doing these long form works that you use to make sure that you're not using the same trope? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Phil: </b>I th I think with, especially looping and especially looping guitars, it's, it's very easy to fall into the, you approximate some kind of rhythm or drum beat kind of thing. And then you put a baseline on top and then you put a chord progression on top, and then you put a melody on top and to the point where it builds and builds and builds and builds. And then you might drop it all out except for one loop, but then you bring everything back. That was the kind of thing I was doing. Not so rhythmic, but that was the kind of thing I was doing. Building up some layers and then dropping them and then building them and dropping them. And eventually I'd stop. And then when I moved to performing with Macs and, and, and computers, I was essentially doing the same thing, but with a guitar <span style="color:red" data-ts="1913.805" data-end_ts="1914.005" title="1913.805" id=c_"1913.805">__or__</span> with a computer instead of a, a loop pedal, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Phil: </b>And I might add a few field recordings or something. Right. I'd set a background thing where I'd just trigger a field recording, and then I'd play a kind of couple of chord loop and then I'd play other stuff on top of that. And I think frustration from that has led me to what I'm doing now in the sense that actually, I think in everything I'm doing at the moment, actually what I've done quite deliberately is given up a lot of control. So I, I build things in a way that the computer runs. I can, I can more or less just turn the patch on and it's running, and there might be, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1955.125" data-end_ts="1955.365" title="1955.125" id=c_"1955.125">__dunno__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1955.365" data-end_ts="1955.525" title="1955.365" id=c_"1955.365">__for__</span> the sake of argument, four sounds running and I can bring them in and out and change something about 'em. Like, if it's like a clicking sound, it either clicks really fast or really slow, or if it's, an oscillator, I can, if it generates a random frequency that I like, I can lock it in. I can press a button to keep that frequency, or I can, and every time the fader hits zero it or trigger a new one, but everything's always running and I can just kind of, I suppose, kind of live mix in a way. For me, that's been good because I don't always know what's gonna happen. I have an idea of what's gonna happen, but, I don't <span style="color:red" data-ts="1994.845" data-end_ts="1994.965" title="1994.845" id=c_"1994.845">__know__</span> exactly what's gonna happen, which has stopped it becoming formulaic for me. Yeah. And yeah, I've been a lot more productive as a result of that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Setting yourself up to, to surprise yourself often is I think a really good play as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Phil: </b>For sure. Yeah, definitely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So that sounds like a really interesting way, way to approach it, but I'm just, one of the things that we all do as artists is we introduce new things and take away old things in order to sort of evolve our work. Right? Yeah. What are the, some of the things that you feel yourself drawing into and what are the things that you're walking away? So like you, you mentioned things like field recordings and stuff. Is that something that you're adding in or is that starting to wane or is that just sort of like a, a like the spine of your work and, and what are the things that you have a tendency to want to bring it at all? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Phil: </b>The, the, the biggest thing I took out was guitars. There was something about, I don't <span style="color:red" data-ts="2060.815" data-end_ts="2060.895" title="2060.815" id=c_"2060.815">__know__</span> if it was if, I think it probably would've been the same if I played, you know, the saxophone or, or <span style="color:red" data-ts="2065.855" data-end_ts="2066.055" title="2065.855" id=c_"2065.855">__any__</span> or anything else. There was something about it that I felt very rigid and I didn't feel like I was being very creative when I was trying to write music with them. So as soon as I got rid of that and just worked with electronics and the computer, that opened up to me. And I think that was probably the biggest thing I've taken out that's been good for me because I think something, yeah, something about the interface maybe between me and what I was making the music on, I got rid of all those muscle memories. You know, you can, if I just programmed something to press go, it <span style="color:red" data-ts="2100.415" data-end_ts="2100.535" title="2100.415" id=c_"2100.415">__is__</span> you, you know, you can have something you never imagined you would have. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Phil: </b>So that's, that's probably the biggest thing. Field recordings, I took them out entirely for a while because it was this thing of, I put too many in. I didn't really know why I was using them. I just wanted more texture. Right. And, hey, field recordings are cool. Uhhuh <affirmative>, I'm bringing them back in. I still make them. Like, I was on, vacation in Portugal last week and I made a few field recordings there. I dunno if I'll do anything with them. I enjoy making recordings, but I think if I use them in any kind of performance or in a piece, I, I try and think about why I'm using it and I try and make the recording in a way that's not simply documenting an environment 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Or documenting an environment and playing guitar over the top of it. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Phil: </b><laugh>. Exactly. Yeah. Which to me, now, when I think about that stuff I used to play, oh my God, <laugh>, I don't really use field recordings much now. I kind of use more. I, I think I've replaced them by bringing in kind of more found sounds maybe. So, it would, it could be things like, the main thing I kind of have, my more recent obsession with found sound has been, audio from Cold War Public Service announcement films. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Phil: </b>Especially the, especially the, the British. Have you heard any of the British ones from like the eighties? No. There was a series of films, I think it was called Protect and Survive in the UK in the eighties. But what to Do in case of Nuclear Attack, basically Uhhuh <affirmative>. But the, the voiceover is so matter of fact. And so almost bored by the whole thing that it's just terrifying, you know? And I think that attracted me because you can 'cause the Cold War's very attractive in that sense from a kind of narrative sense. You can imagine all these things. Sure. But also <span style="color:red" data-ts="2217.085" data-end_ts="2217.325" title="2217.085" id=c_"2217.085">__this__</span>, there seemed to kind of be a lot of in-between kind of things they were saying, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2222.875" data-end_ts="2223.165" title="2222.875" id=c_"2222.875">__like__</span> maybe to kind of make people less afraid. I don't know what it was, but they seemed to kind of say things that were very dull, <laugh>, kind of filler, just kind of filler stuff. So this one piece I've made last year, I took some audio from some Amer American Cold War films, actually. But I used, I, I didn't use anything that kind of, you know, talked about fallout or shelters or bombs or anything. I just took the bits where the announcer would say things like, would you know what to do? Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Or Yeah. What was another one? Right. The filler statement's. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Phil: </b>Right. The filler stuff. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2256.845" data-end_ts="2257.005" title="2256.845" id=c_"2256.845">__And__</span> you could have made things easier for yourself was one phrase that kept coming up. And I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2261.245" data-end_ts="2261.445" title="2261.245" id=c_"2261.245">__use__</span> that 'cause there's something about it that's so, I don't know, it just kind of, it's that pregnant moment thing. If you can just imagine a whole, like a kind of photography thing, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2269.485" data-end_ts="2269.645" title="2269.485" id=c_"2269.485">__or__</span> you can imagine this whole thing exploding around there. Right. So I think maybe I've replaced field recordings with that kind of thing more because they're much more, they're much smaller chunks of sound. So I can think more, I can place them more and fit and work out more what they're for almost. Right. Instead of just having some nice bird song for 20 minutes with a guitar line. <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I really appreciate you spending the time. I, I pretty much burned through our time, but before you go, I just have one more question. With this, the composed long form work that you do, do you ever do live performances of that work? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Phil: </b>I do sometimes, yeah.

<b>Darwin: </b>I'm always curious how people take something That to me is very much a studio practice and how they take it live. What is, what does it look like when you do a performance live? Do you have like a bunch of recorders and broken recorders and stuff? Or do you work off of a laptop or, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Phil: </b>It, it de there's, there's two main ones <span style="color:red" data-ts="2330.325" data-end_ts="2330.565" title="2330.325" id=c_"2330.325">__that__</span> I either use my laptop, or I'll use my kind of what I think to be my main performance instrument, which is a raspberry pie with a very simple, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data">PD</a> patch on it. Mm-Hmm. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2342.605" data-end_ts="2342.645" title="2342.605" id=c_"2342.605">__<affirmative>__</span>, and a mixer with a feedback loop. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Phil: </b>Okay. So if I'm performing with my laptop, it'll be performing with a patch that I made specifically for one piece. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2353.185" data-end_ts="2353.405" title="2353.185" id=c_"2353.185">__One__</span> piece. So there was a piece I made last year called structure, which is essentially eight layers of oscillators changing frequency and delay time and something else, some kind of ring mod very, very quickly. Eight layers of that kind of different frequency bands. And to perform that, I'll just have, you know, like your basic kind of nano control and a launch pad just to fade, to do levels and turn things on and off. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> usually I kind of stand quite still when I do that kind of thing. And try and crank the volume on the pa as much as possible to, to kind of get, not force, but like encourage people to listen instead of watch what I'm doing. Right. And then if I perform with the raspberry pie, it's, I control that with <span style="color:red" data-ts="2398.845" data-end_ts="2398.965" title="2398.845" id=c_"2398.845">__the__</span> nano control as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Phil: </b>But then I have the, the mixer as well, which just has a very simple feedback loop. But because the nature of a mixing board, when you perform with it, you kind of move more anyway. Like your arms move around and you kind of lean in to do stuff and it can be very volatile sometimes. So you kind of have this weird tension release thing with your equipment. So maybe I move more for when I perform with that stuff, but that's less lowercase <span style="color:red" data-ts="2423.805" data-end_ts="2423.965" title="2423.805" id=c_"2423.805">__and__</span> kind of turns more into, it can be quite low case sometimes, but it, with the feedback, they <span style="color:red" data-ts="2429.505" data-end_ts="2429.725" title="2429.505" id=c_"2429.505">__can__</span> very often tumble into noise stuff. Sure. But I still don't move a whole lot. Generally. I stand quite still. I'm still, I, I'm still trying to work that out. Really. I've experimented with playing this stuff with video, or with very little light in the performance space, and I'm still working out how I want to present it live.

<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I am looking forward to someday maybe getting a chance to see you perform and I certainly, I've been enjoying the recorded work, so I want to thank you for taking the time to, talk with me today. It was a real pleasure to, to chat with you and just kind of hear about where you're coming from and also the kinds of things you're doing and how you're doing it. Thank you so much, Phil, for the time. I really appreciate it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Phil: </b>Oh, thank you for having me. It's been a real pleasure. Alright, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well with that, I'm gonna let you get on with the rest of your day. Have a good one. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Phil: </b>Thank you, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2481.965" data-end_ts="2482.165" title="2481.965" id=c_"2481.965">__Darren__</span>. Cheers.

<b>Darwin: </b>Hey, thanks a lot again to Phil for letting us, hear about his process and hear about how he goes about the things he does. It's always interesting hearing from a guy who's, got a lot of different ways that he approaches his work. I want to thank you to listeners for tuning in again this week. I also want to thank you for giving me a week off last week. It was, nice to have a little time off. I want you to make sure that you're, you continue sharing this with your friends, with people that you meet, people that you know. I want to thank, everybody I got to see last weekend when, Ronan was in town. It was fun to hang out with y'all, but in, in general, just hang in there, share this with people and I will be back next week. Thanks a lot. Bye.
