<b>Darwin: </b>Today I have the privilege of being able to talk to, someone who's <span style="color:red" data-ts="17.585" data-end_ts="17.805" title="17.585" id=c_"17.585">__who__</span> I, who just seems to come up on my Facebook feed an awful lot. <span style="color:red" data-ts="21.865" data-end_ts="22.085" title="21.865" id=c_"21.865">__And__</span> I see talking on Muff Wiggler <span style="color:red" data-ts="24.205" data-end_ts="24.485" title="24.205" id=c_"24.205">__site__</span> an awful lot. His name's Logan Erickson and he's the mastermind behind Logan Electronics, a company that I find pretty fascinating because, he builds a lot of different kinds of things and, they all seem to be of interest to me in one way or another. So rather than defining him for you, I will let him do it himself. So let's start off by saying hi to Logan. Hi, Logan. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Logan Erickson: </b>I'm doing very well. Thank you for having me on. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thank you so much for taking the time out and joining us To kick this off, why don't I have you explain, explain your work a little bit. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Logan: </b>My work, I guess it could be considered a whole lot of chaos at this point since I, I seem to not have a focus <laugh>, but, primarily, synth builder. You know, I dabble in arcade and pinball machines on the side as well, musician. But as far as my, my day-to-Day, I'm primarily a, a synth manufacturer, like modular synth manufacturer. I do a lot of custom builds, commission work for people as well. And I do a little bit of repair work on the side just to kind of keep me busy as if I wasn't busy enough already, but, you know, keeps the bills paid. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. I like your, explanation of being, you know, maybe a little chaotic because when I look at your product line, what it seems like is I'm almost watching the things that you personally are interested in. I, I would say of, of all the manufacturers, you have like the most personal set of, set of tools that you sell. So you, you've got interfaces for, eighth inch to quarter inch or eighth inch to Banana. You've got a couple of eurorack modules, the sub <span style="color:red" data-ts="135.285" data-end_ts="135.485" title="135.285" id=c_"135.285">__mix__</span> series, which is probably the most widely known. You have panels for doing five U conversions of, some of Syntex modules. You've got a pretty wide variety as well as doing builds of the TTSH and stuff like that. So it's a really diversified kind of set of work, but it seems like it's almost like looking at all the things that you're into, right? It looks like looking into your toy chest. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Logan: </b>Yeah. Yeah, definitely. Yeah, I mean, I've, I've been trying to focus in the last year a little bit more on the DIY, kind of the tools that might help people get into, more of conversion, practices for whether it's like porting over modules from say, Eurorack into the MOG format. I'm kind of a, a fan of the Moog format, and it's, it's definitely a comfortable format for me. I just wish there were far more modules available, in that format. So you could definitely see that there's sort of a need for that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. It's interesting. I, I actually, in my res renewed interest in modulars, I've, I've been using modulars for 20 years now, but when I kind of came back to them maybe eight years ago, something like that, I started off with <span style="color:red" data-ts="208.725" data-end_ts="208.845" title="208.725" id=c_"208.725">__a__</span> a.com focus system, although I had gotten other modules from other builders, and I really found the, the format interesting and useful. It was, it was nice because it, to me, it was very performative. It was easy to get your hands into it. It was really satisfying to, to jack in those big old quarter inch jacks. Right. There was something to it that was really, it, it seemed more visceral, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Logan: </b>Yeah. It's, it's, I, I don't know. What if it's just the spacing of everything and, and just the overall comfort and <span style="color:red" data-ts="242.305" data-end_ts="242.525" title="242.305" id=c_"242.305">__it__</span>, it really comes down for me is, is interface. I, I'm very picky When it comes to an interface for a synthesizer, what, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What kind of things do you find are, cause you the most, like the biggest, psychic speed bumps when you're working with interface? What are things that bother you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Logan: </b>I could definitely say cramming too much into a panel tends to drive me a little nuts. <span style="color:red" data-ts="265.745" data-end_ts="265.965" title="265.745" id=c_"265.745">__It__</span>, it's funny being a Eurorack manufacturer, it's like, I, I, I deal with that on an everyday basis. When I sit down and, and use my system. I, I, I don't wanna like naysay the format. It's just, I, I definitely think that, you know, it's one of those, just because you can fit it doesn't mean you should <laugh>. It's definitely a, a words of wisdom. I think I could, I could, I, I say to myself at least, right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I agree. I mean, it's, your rec's a wonderful format, but I think it's, it's interesting to kind of, I, I don't know that many people who dabble in both. And so it's, it's fun for me to talk to somebody that has, because, you know, sure the jacks are a little different and stuff, but mentally there's nothing different between the two systems, really. Right. But for some reason, the, the, the size of it, or maybe the, I don't know, the, maybe the way that the knobs felt in my hand or something. There was definitely a different way that I approached and interacted with it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Logan: </b>Yeah. It's, it's very interesting to, to see how we, you know, everybody in general approaches a different interface differently. I, the way I approach the MOG format system is very different from say, like how I approach a surge system or a <span style="color:red" data-ts="339.715" data-end_ts="340.005" title="339.715" id=c_"339.715">__URAC__</span> system. It's, it's very interesting to me to see how I interact with the each format. Right 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, when I look at your site, what I see is, is kind of nods to all the formats. 'cause in addition to having these conversion kits for, for, five U and, <span style="color:red" data-ts="359.595" data-end_ts="359.885" title="359.595" id=c_"359.595">__Moog__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="360.385" data-end_ts="360.605" title="360.385" id=c_"360.385">__MO__</span> sized units, you also have some things that touch on ULA systems, some things that kind of hint towards surge <span style="color:red" data-ts="369.485" data-end_ts="369.725" title="369.485" id=c_"369.485">__based__</span> systems. And you mentioned it right there as well. Yeah. Do you, do you dabble in those as well? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Logan: </b>Yes. I am, I, I'm a big fan of the Surge system. I kind of didn't come around to it up until about probably four or five years ago, when a friend introduced me to his system. And it just really forced me to think of synthesis in a different way. And I, I can't escape Banana Sense. I just love the Banana connector. I don't know what it is. <laugh>, you know, you got your built-in Stack Cable, and it's just all in all a really comfortable interface for me. And, I got hooked on, another format, that would be, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="411.165" data-end_ts="411.365" title="411.165" id=c_"411.165">__band__</span> brand is Bug brand. Right. I've been kind of, people have seen me perform with that system, numerous times while I had it. And that was more of a, you know, like a three U ra, frack, but with bananas. Right. And, that was kind of another sort of my segue into banana, banana synth stuff, and I've been hooked ever since. And, and I just, I love, I love the search format. It's, it's very comfortable. It's kind of like the ideal for me. It's the ideal, modular panel size. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The, the, for you you mean the, the height of it? Yeah. Or you mean <span style="color:red" data-ts="446.085" data-end_ts="446.205" title="446.085" id=c_"446.085">__like__</span> the individual widths of the, the pieces or 
</p>

<p>
<b>Logan: </b>Just everything about it just is comfortable for me. I'm not one for like a grid based system usually, but like, there's something about the <span style="color:red" data-ts="456.045" data-end_ts="456.285" title="456.045" id=c_"456.045">__surge__</span> system that's like, okay, you know, this, this is great, this is comfortable. Right. Vertical height <span style="color:red" data-ts="462.685" data-end_ts="462.925" title="462.685" id=c_"462.685">__wise__</span>, you get just enough, controls into the height. I, I just think like with Eurorack specifically, it's, it's the vertical, the vertical height that you have to work with just doesn't allow you to get quite, you have to get kind of creative with regards to how you lay things out. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That's certainly, I, I can see that one of the things I like doing in my podcast is talking to people about their background and how they get into things, and especially people who are adept at electronics and electronic design, how it is that they decided to focus on music electronics. I'm always curious about that. I'm curious to find out what your background is, how much of a musician you were versus how much of a tech kid you were and, and what the path is to getting where you are today. Can you kind of fill that in for me a little bit? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Logan: </b>Yeah, absolutely. I can pretty much, and it's funny. Okay. Like I can blame my mother for it, for everything <laugh>. And she told me I would someday <laugh>, she forced me, she forced me to take classical piano lessons, when I was very young for about seven years. And at the time I just, I, I hated her for it. But when I stopped, it kind of left me with having that, the knowledge base of being able to pick up most instruments and, and play them musically, like by ear. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Logan: </b>I guess I would say somewhere between the ages of like 12 and thir 12, 13 and 14, I think I was kind of introduced into like, the world of industrial music. And, you know, like back then, of course I'm 32 now, so like Marilyn Manson, nine inch nails, right. White zombie, stuff like that. The cure, I mean, all, all kinds of stuff from the nineties was, was pretty popular. And naturally I got into that and I was kind of curious, you know, what was making some of the sounds that I was hearing. And, and a friend got me into, a couple of different friends. One got me into circuit bending, and then one got me into just the noise scene in general and how that stuff was done and how you could use so little to create so much. And that was kind of how I got hooked was, you know, right out of, middle school. Early, early into high school. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What, what was the process you went to learn about electronics? Did you start off by sort of like naively doing circuit bending and then fill in the blanks? Oh, yeah. <laugh>, or did you take a more studied approach? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Logan: </b>I, I definitely, I mean, I can blame circuit bending for sparking my curiosity into electronics. I don't know if that's cliche or not, but it was around the time when it was first starting to get pretty popular and I kind of turned it into a, a pseudo business through high school selling circuit bent speaking spells and SSK ones on eBay. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, for anybody that got one that may be listening, I apologize. My skills were not as good <laugh>. But, yeah. So that's kind of where I got interested into the electronics. And my senior year of high school, I was offered to, go into college early and I started a basic electronics degree. And that was, 'cause I was, I really wanted to learn more about, you know, synthesizer electronics. At that point I was kind of full into electronic music and, and DJing a lot of house, house music drum and bass music and stuff like that. And so I was very interested in how, how this technology was, was being created. Unfortunately in college they, it was not necessarily technical, but, you know, my teachers were looking at me like, we don't teach synthesizer electronics. Like, we're gonna teach you how to fix something for some industrial complex. Right, right. Or like a warehouse, some sort of a manufacturing place. And it's like, well, that's not doing it for me. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You know, my, my first year of college was, an electrical engineering degree and I was sorely disappointed by what passed for, what passed for electrical engineering in that, in that kind of scenario. Yeah. Wasn't, there wasn't, there wasn't no fun in involved. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Logan: </b>Yeah. And it's, I mean, growing up in Duluth, Minnesota, it was, I mean, that's just what they kind of train you for is, is planning on taking that local, you know, simple job that Right. It was a basic electronics degree, so it wasn't like a double E, it was just a community college. And I see, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Logan: </b>I ended up actually dropping out, about one semester shy of that degree. Looking back at it now, I kind of regret that just, just 'cause it would've been good to finish. But I got into audio engineering after that, so I just started working at recording studios. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So coming out of, out of Duluth, where did you find recording studios to work at? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Logan: </b>Well, I had moved, this would've been 2003, I moved from Duluth to Minneapolis. And here in Minneapolis we have, there are a, a number of, of recording studios, but one of the ones that I worked out of, helped a buddy of mine, Tom Herbers, from third year recording studio. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, which sadly is now closed due to, the U of M expansion projects and stuff. But, so that <span style="color:red" data-ts="774.925" data-end_ts="775.045" title="774.925" id=c_"774.925">__was__</span>, it was a lot of fun. I mean, I, I had worked, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="777.405" data-end_ts="777.525" title="777.405" id=c_"777.405">__had__</span> went to school for engineering, audio engineering for a short period of time, and then started working, you know, recording people and stuff. And I, I quickly realized that I don't really like listening and recording to other people's terrible music all the time. 'cause I mean, you get lucky and get, get, some really good bands and whatnot, but, it just kind of started to become more headache than it was worth in my opinion. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, the recording studio business is always, always a tough sled because unless you happen to be running Heavy Road studio, you sometimes are <span style="color:red" data-ts="812.845" data-end_ts="813.045" title="812.845" id=c_"812.845">__gonna__</span> have to do the children's singalong, record <laugh>. You're sometimes going to have to edit the audio tapes from a melanoma conference. Both of those are part of my history, so I know what you mean. Some of that stuff can be a little rough. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Logan: </b>Yeah. Just it gets a little tiring <span style="color:red" data-ts="831.885" data-end_ts="832.085" title="831.885" id=c_"831.885">__where__</span> it's like, oh, we could fix that later. And it's like, well, why don't you just play it right the first time and Right. You know, it's less work to do later, <laugh>. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Exactly. When is it that you switched over to doing, to doing the <span style="color:red" data-ts="845.485" data-end_ts="845.685" title="845.485" id=c_"845.485">__music__</span> electronics then as kind of your main gig? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Logan: </b>I was, kind of doing it part-time for, for a while while I had my day job. I, let's see, 2004, like 2004, I was, working with, one of my mentors, Eddie <span style="color:red" data-ts="862.625" data-end_ts="862.845" title="862.625" id=c_"862.625">__Ti__</span> at Manhattan Sound Technicians, which he was actually based in South St. Paul, but originally <span style="color:red" data-ts="869.085" data-end_ts="869.365" title="869.085" id=c_"869.085">__healing__</span> from Manhattan, fixing lots of, of dat machines and, you know, studio gear. And that was kind of where I got my crunch course in, you know, hardcore electronics repair. And that was, it was a really good learning experience for me. And, and it definitely got me hooked on, on doing what it is that I wanted to do. And I was starting very little at that point to, start working on actual like kind of audio circuits for myself that were, you know, less modifying of synthesizers and, and circuit bending and stuff like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Logan: </b>Like, and I wanted to kind of start focusing on more, I won't say like original pieces, but you know, something from scratch as opposed to moding modifying something that was already in existence. So that was kind of where I, I started in that. But yeah, I, I, I, I guess I've been working on audio, like audio electronics, I mean, since I was 14 in reality, <span style="color:red" data-ts="919.865" data-end_ts="920.085" title="919.865" id=c_"919.865">__but__</span> Right. I guess when it came to doing this full-time for myself, it was, two years ago. Yeah. Basically about two years ago now, I quit my job. I was working at Great River Electronics. Oh, okay. And it was just, it seemed kind of the right time for me to leave and, and the right time for me to kind of start focusing on doing this full time. And, you know, I've been super happy. I, it's probably one of the best decisions I've ever made. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that's cool. Well, I know that, two years ago that would've been, you were full on doing Euro Rack stuff at that point. You had the short bus and the, the, mix, is it Mix seven or sub <span style="color:red" data-ts="962.545" data-end_ts="962.765" title="962.545" id=c_"962.545">__mix__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="962.765" data-end_ts="962.845" title="962.765" id=c_"962.765">__seven__</span>, the 
</p>

<p>
<b>Logan: </b>Sub <span style="color:red" data-ts="963.405" data-end_ts="963.565" title="963.405" id=c_"963.405">__mix__</span>, sub <span style="color:red" data-ts="963.845" data-end_ts="964.005" title="963.845" id=c_"963.845">__mix__</span> seven and the Short Bus, those actually came out in 2011. Oh, okay. 2010, 2011. I was still working. I had a day job at the time. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But yeah, those were the, the first two Eurorack products that that came out. And, they certainly, they, they did well for, for what they were, and considering how, how, I won't say Young, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="984.605" data-end_ts="985.085" title="984.605" id=c_"984.605">__Eurorack__</span> scene was at the time, but it was just at that point where it was starting to, you know, people were catching on. It wasn't just, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="992.555" data-end_ts="992.845" title="992.555" id=c_"992.555">__dour__</span> that was around. It was, you know, whether it was, make Noise or Harvest Man or, just there's, it wasn't as huge as it is like now. It's, it's really gotten amazingly large at this point. The market has. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But as, as a builder then, you were kind of in play during the blooming of the blooming of the Rose that is Euro Rack. What in your mind, or at least your, from your personal sense of it, what were some of the big turning points was? What were some of the big turning points in terms of modules that kind of upped the game in the community? What were some of the things that you saw happening, like with specific users that all of a sudden were, were getting into it? What were some of the turning points for you with, with that John, with that environment? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Logan: </b>I guess it would go without saying, I mean, once, once Mutable came into the market that was mutable Instruments, that was a, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1056.765" data-end_ts="1056.885" title="1056.765" id=c_"1056.765">__a__</span> huge game changer as far as I was concerned. Just seeing what, what he's doing with his, his products, it's amazing to me. I mean, really, like, I don't possess any skills of programming and to, to see the hybrid concept, come in. I mean, obviously Harvest Man was doing a lot of, like the Hertz Donut and Piston Honda, which again, were fantastic modules. Like, I, I love his stuff. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But seeing some of the things that were coming out from mutable, like braids, right. It, it's been definitely interesting to see the market, like how it's evolved and how it's, you know, what was, what was considered to be like, I won't say like cool, but what was considered to be like the norm in 2011, 2012. How much has drastically changed now that like, you see so many companies, I mean, to see like Waldorf Roland and, you know, these larger synth companies starting hopping on the bandwagon for Eurorack. It's, it's amazing to me. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Indeed it is. Now one of the things that, concerns me and concerns a lot of people, I think, is the sense that it's a relatively small community, but the number of product makers is growing maybe more rapidly than the number of users. Do you have any fears of that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Logan: </b>I have a fear of that pretty much every day. <laugh> <laugh> being, being that this is my primary income. Right. You know, it puts a lot of pressure on what, what I've seen in the last two years, is this growing trend in constantly announcing new modules. And then part of that is the market. I think part of that would be like the resellers, you know, it's kind of like, what, what's gonna be the, the trendy module this week? And that, that actually has me very nervous because, you know, if we wanna draw parallels to say like the boutique pedal market, I mean, it's the same exact situation that's happening. Right. And unfortunately, we have that to draw on for inspiration. So, you know, that could happen even faster. And that's one of the things that I would be, or that I am concerned about. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, that's, that's a great point. I hadn't thought about it that way, but there, there definitely is a map being, or there has been a map drawn by the pedal manufacturers and almost like the race to everybody starving is a little bit of a scary thing to see. Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Logan: </b><affirmative>. Yeah. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="1217.755" data-end_ts="1217.975" title="1217.755" id=c_"1217.755">__it__</span>, it's, I I encourage people to get into it. And, you know, I'm, I probably one of the main reasons why I haven't released as much as I would like to at the moment is I really want to try to put something out there that's somewhat different. And you're seeing a lot of repeating, repeating themes or, or whether it's like, I mean, there's just, there's only so much you can do in the analog world. And that's, it has me a little afraid just because it's, it's like, you know, I'm, I'm a very analog guy and I don't, like I said, I don't know, you know, I'm not a programmer, so it's kind of like, well, I either hire somebody or I need to learn how to do this stuff, but <laugh>. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Logan: </b>It's the struggle to kind of put something out that's gonna be worthwhile. But, you know, I want it to stay on the test of time, but I don't want it to just like, be rehashing something that's been, you know, beat to death for so many times. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I hear you. That's, and, and it seems like this concept of having it constantly announced new, it, it not only has to be new, but it has to be, everything has to be groundbreaking. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and everything has to do massive amounts of stuff. And it seems like, I don't know, it, it's, it seems it's almost overwhelming to keep up, let alone, to try, to try and make sense of what could end up being a musical tool. But I, I'm a big fan of getting facility on the instrument that you have. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But if your instrument is changing every week, it's really difficult for me to imagine how you become a strong player on that instrument. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Logan: </b>Yeah. And that's, the key word there is instrument, I think. And being a, a manufacturer, I'm gonna always say, you know, bye bye bye <laugh>. But, what I shouldn't be saying is that it's like, what, what we're seeing is it's, I mean, it's called eurorack for a reason. I mean, people love the consumption aspect of it. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1339.615" data-end_ts="1339.965" title="1339.615" id=c_"1339.615">__Right__</span>. And it's, it's, you know, it's, it's interesting because, you know, what we're supposed to be doing is building a completely custom instrument and, and focus on that instrument and learn that instrument, learn its ins and outs, find its weaknesses, and exploit them and, you know, set limitations for yourself. And what I'm seeing more and more is it's, it's less about the instrument, more about, well, look what I've got. Yeah. And I mean, cool. It makes great sounds. And, and I'm not gonna get into the argument of like, you know, everybody should be making, you know, quote unquote legitimate music with their modular. 'cause that's, that's not the argument. I don't think that's one <span style="color:red" data-ts="1383.125" data-end_ts="1383.285" title="1383.125" id=c_"1383.125">__to__</span> have. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1383.455" data-end_ts="1383.805" title="1383.455" id=c_"1383.455">__Right__</span>, right, right. No, but one of the things I have noticed, and a couple of weeks ago I did an interview with a guy and we were talking, he, for his own like, consumption of modular systems, he made some very specific, decisions. One of 'em was that he was going, he wasn't gonna use modules that he didn't hand build. So he was a, you know, he consumed kits, which when you have a kit, you're just consuming things at a slower pace anyway. Right. Because you have to build them. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Logan: </b>Yep. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And, but also he wanted things in search type format as well. So he used that as kind of a thing to limit all, limit his access to tons of different, you know, magic modules. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And instead put himself in a position of having to really understand how his oscillators work so that he could, you know, get in depth on how the FM is peculiar in different cases and stuff like that. And I thought it was a really interesting approach. You know, he, there's always this trope in music that limitations breed creativity. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Logan: </b>Exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But I was really interested to see how he applied that concept to the actual construction of his instrument. It was really interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Logan: </b>Oh, that's, it's one of the things that I love about, say, like the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1471.125" data-end_ts="1471.365" title="1471.125" id=c_"1471.125">__surge__</span> system specifically is typically, or at least traditionally it was one large panel, right. You're, you're committed to what is in that <laugh> <laugh> like, so you have to think it out and, and plan it out very well. And, and that's nice. 'cause it means like if you're gonna swap that out, which I don't recommend, but it means you're gonna lose a huge chunk of your system if you choose to do that. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's gonna be a traumatic experience. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Logan: </b>So, and that's, I mean, again, it comes back to the instrument and, and I think it is very important for people to start. I mean, I, I, I've gone from really large eurorack systems to, for instance, my, my dedicated harvest man, poly vox system, like it's just a single 1 0 1 0 4 hp. So you <span style="color:red" data-ts="1518.685" data-end_ts="1518.805" title="1518.685" id=c_"1518.685">__got__</span> three U 1 0 4 HP with, you know, very similar to the ARP 2,600 setup. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, in the sense that I had three oscillators, I doubled up on the A DSR VCAs and I doubled up on the filters. Yeah. And, and added, what was it, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1532.565" data-end_ts="1532.765" title="1532.565" id=c_"1532.565">__the__</span>, it was kind of like a slew, slew generator, to it. But that was kind of, that was the system. And I had so much fun just using that system because it was like, this is it. This is all I have now, let's get creative. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Right. Now, do you, did you find like in that case that it, it helped that it was mostly from one specific manufacturer, that it, it integrated itself better in some way? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Logan: </b>I definitely, I would agree with that. I, I get a little OCD sometimes when it comes to the <laugh>, the panels and stuff. I mean, I could have a full system that's a million different manufacturers, but, and it wouldn't bother me, but it definitely helps to have, to me, grouping of, of manufacturers or at least similar aesthetics. I had a, a complete VRBO system. Also very comfortable to use, well thought out. Mark and I have very similar opinions with regards to performance aspect for a modular synthesizer. And so it was, I loved the interface of his, his system as well. And they definitely grouped nicely. I'm 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Glad you said that because I look at my system and it's just clear that, there comes a point at which I'll actually like, make compromises, in order to make it so that the panels kind of look right next to each other. I can't do the checkerboard style system. That just, that, that's an OCD thing for me. That's a psychic psychic speed bump that I can't get over. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Logan: </b>Yeah. I've, I've got a, at least, at least one friend, I, I don't, I won't call him out by name, but he's, he's got the OCD on panel, altering down as with regards to, he had to swap out all of the knobs so that they all matched <laugh>. All of his cables were like certain colors. And his music is absolutely wonderful. So I won't, I'm not, I'm not trash <span style="color:red" data-ts="1642.925" data-end_ts="1643.205" title="1642.925" id=c_"1642.925">__talking__</span> him by any means, but he'll know who he is when I, when he hears this 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> <laugh>. It's hilarious. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Logan: </b>But, you know, I, it's, I, I get it. I mean, and that's what's the beauty of, of the modular design is like, I mean, by design, we have the choice of putting in whatever we want and we can offer it too if we want to change. You know, we like what's there, but you know, you're seeing more and more like people starting to offer alternate panels, which, at first I would think, like, I'd be insulted if somebody wanted to change out my panel. And, and believe me, I got plenty of questions with the, the original short bus being school bus yellow, you know, I'd constantly get emails like, oh, do you have an aluminum panel? Yeah. It's like, no, it's, it's school bus yellow. 'cause it's a short bus man. Right, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1683.925" data-end_ts="1684.125" title="1683.925" id=c_"1683.925">__right__</span>. <laugh>, like, I thought that was clever <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Logan: </b>But I, you know, I appreciate those, you know, the people that want to, to alter their <span style="color:red" data-ts="1691.965" data-end_ts="1692.245" title="1691.965" id=c_"1691.965">__sense__</span> and, and make, get, you know, more pleasurable I guess to them. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, one question I have earlier you said that one of the things that you're doing is doing some custom work, custom design or custom creation. What does that look like? Are you actually doing one-off modules for people? Or are you, modifying modules to, to spec? Or what, what does that kinda look like? Because I think there's a lot of people for whom the exactly perfect module doesn't exist. And so then the question is, well, you know, I would love to do something, but I can't design it myself. Is there someone that can do it for me and the will will they only do it if my name is Keith Emerson? You know, <laugh> questions like 
</p>

<p>
<b>Logan: </b>That. Yeah. Yeah. A lot of the commission work tends to be like, if somebody doesn't have DIY skills, they'll want me to build, you know, whether it's, I've got a couple that I'm working on, like the hex inverter 8 0 8 Toms. I've got a few of those in process for people that just don't wanna, you know, they, they don't have the skillset to, to assemble something like that. Or, I, I've had some requests for like completely custom modules and, and some of the stuff can be done, but as you said, I mean, when I had a day job, I, I would be more open to doing, sitting down and working with somebody to do something completely custom that's more, more of an in-depth concept. Right. But nowadays, I have to kinda weigh my options with regards to how much time is that gonna really take away from what I need for out of my week. Sure. And so it's kind of, I mean, I've, I've flat out told, you know, pretty large customers of mine where it's just like, I would love to do that for you, but I mean, if I quoted <span style="color:red" data-ts="1803.345" data-end_ts="1803.565" title="1803.345" id=c_"1803.345">__you__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1803.565" data-end_ts="1803.885" title="1803.565" id=c_"1803.565">__proper__</span> for just the development cost on that, you'd laugh at me <laugh>. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Logan: </b>And it's not me trying to like rip anybody off, it's just I have to be kind of unrealistic about certain things at this point. And so, yeah. So it's a lot of what I do is, is, you know, kit building essentially for people. Sure. There'll be like custom synth panels that people want me to put together. With regards to like the surge stuff, I've got a friend who does some beautiful metal work. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1831.565" data-end_ts="1831.685" title="1831.565" id=c_"1831.565">__E__</span> nasty metalworking, I'll just throw his name out there. Luigi. He does absolutely beautiful work for me. And, and that's really allowed me to do some pretty cool one-off pieces for people. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's that's pretty neat. Yeah. He does the, he does the stuff where it's like really deconstructed metal work, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Logan: </b>Yeah. It's, it's like acid etching and one of his, he can do clean, he can do really clean, just fine. But he loves doing something that just looks like, I mean, it looks gritty. And, and that's, I I love that style about him. It's Right. It's really cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that's, that's interesting. And thanks for, bringing him up. I've always been, I've always wanted, to know somebody <span style="color:red" data-ts="1872.205" data-end_ts="1872.365" title="1872.205" id=c_"1872.205">__who__</span> knew him so I could find out a little bit more. Yeah. Because I'm fascinated by looking at that stuff. I mean, it is so like post-industrial nastiness, it's really cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Logan: </b>Yeah, Luigi is an awesome guy. I mean, he's an amazing friend. And, and oddly enough, I mean, because of, because of the modular scene, I mean, he and I have become, I consider him one of my best friends, even though like we never talk on the phone. He lives in Cincinnati and I live in Minnesota, like in Minneapolis. And so, you know, we'll be texting each other back and forth, usually on a daily basis. And it's because of this modular scene that we've become friends and it's, it's been great. It's, it's truly awesome. I love the fact that, you know, the amount of people that I've met through this, this community, it's just amazing to me. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Our time is already coming to an end. I can't, can't really believe it, but that's, that's fantastic. One of the things, I would like you to tell us a little bit about is what's next on the map for logging electronics? What are, what are, what's a module or some modules that you have coming up that, are gonna hit the scene? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Logan: </b>I've got about six to eight prototypes and process right now that unfortunately I haven't had the focus to. I haven't had the ability to focus on any one of them. But, I am hoping to get a filter envelope combo module coming out here pretty soon. I've got a kind of a, a ring mod, wave shaping circuit that I've been working on. That should be pretty cool. And, then an active switch module, it will, I'm doing it for myself. I don't expect large sales from it, but, it is something that will be a Euro <span style="color:red" data-ts="1973.145" data-end_ts="1973.365" title="1973.145" id=c_"1973.145">__Act__</span> product and hopefully people will like it. That's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Cool. That sounds great. I'll be curious about this ring mod and wage shaper thing. That's, that's one area where I haven't been really satisfied with a lot of the things that I've tried. And, I like ring ring mods anyway, and I love wave shaping, but <span style="color:red" data-ts="1990.745" data-end_ts="1990.965" title="1990.745" id=c_"1990.745">__it__</span> just never can seem to find anything that, you know, it doesn't speak to me in the way that, that, that's where search systems to me were quite amazing. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> the wave shaping the, that wave multiplier is just a stunning sounding piece of, piece of electronics. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Logan: </b>Yeah. And I, I can't help. I mean, I'll, I'll always kind of pay homage to, to the search designs. I mean, I'm, I'm heavily influenced by them, so I, I'd be lying if I said some of the stuff I'll be doing won't be heavily influenced, so. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. Sure. Absolutely. And then, finally, it sounds like, I mean, you mentioned that you're a musician and it sounds like you're a fairly active performer. Now that I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2027.965" data-end_ts="2028.045" title="2027.965" id=c_"2027.965">__am__</span> kind of in your neck of the woods, I'd like to hear a little bit about your performance practice. I mean, do you, do you do many gigs? Do you get the chance to do some gigs? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Logan: </b>Well, yeah. Well first off, welcome to Minnesota. Thank you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>
</p>

<p>
<b>Logan: </b><laugh> <laugh>. Yeah. I, I play out, not, not super often. I kind of swore off, booking my own gigs in a sense. 'cause it's very stressful. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But yeah, I play probably four to six times a year and it's usually all improvised modular, whether it's techno or downtempo or ambient stuff. I definitely, I, I used to do a lot more just pre-programmed music and, and I got really burnt out on that. So now I'm, I'm pretty much exclusively an improvised musician when it comes to performing live. And it's, it's been a lot of fun. It keeps me on my toes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, indeed. It does. That's, that's fantastic. So we'll have to keep in touch when you're playing a gig sometime. I'm gonna just like pop in and maybe at some point we could get a chance to even do some, do some jamming together. That seems like that'd be a lot of fun. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Logan: </b>It would be a lot of fun. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, Logan, thank you so much for your time. I really appreciate it. And, to finish up any words of encouragement to the modular or electronic heads out there? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Logan: </b>Words of encouragement. Let's see. There's no light at the end of the tunnel <laugh> with regards to, purchasing modules. But, if you can, if you can have the, the discipline to focus on, on a small system, you'll get a lot out of it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Agreed. Very good. Well, thank you so much. And have a great evening then. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Logan: </b>Yes, you too. Thanks for having me on. Alright, bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Quick note of thanks to Logan for doing a quick off interview. I was <span style="color:red" data-ts="2149.885" data-end_ts="2150.085" title="2149.885" id=c_"2149.885">__under__</span>, under the gun a little bit this week and he helped out. I am looking forward to seeing him do some gigs though, as well as checking out some more of his gear that's coming up. Thanks again for listening. Check in with us next week. Got more good stuff in the hopper. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2164.465" data-end_ts="2164.685" title="2164.465" id=c_"2164.465">__So__</span> I'll you talking at you then.
