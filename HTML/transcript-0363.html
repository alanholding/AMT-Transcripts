      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Okay today I have the great pleasure of meeting. One of the people whose career, I feel like I've been following since before, since, before I even <span style="color:red" data-ts="10.44" data-end_ts="10.74" title="10.44"
          id=c_"10.44">__owned__</span> my first keyboard in a way I was, I have been entranced by, his writing. I've been a transplant, his work I've been in transplant, his professional life. And so I was really excited to get a chance to speak
        with him. His name's Jeff Rona He, his career spans the creation of MIDI through the creation of an amazing list of soundtracks, a series of, of
        recent solo album releases. And even just recently, his first work as the director of, of a project of a, of a film project. So an incredible career, performer studio, musician, technologist, composer, practically, any hat you wanna, you want
        to find in your closet, he's worn it at one point or another. So with no more to do let's talk to Jeff. Hey Jeff, </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jeff Rona: </b>
      How are you making me feel so old Darwin? Well, there you go. Barely got started. You're just rolling. Well, I just found the on switch.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Well, I have to say, I appreciate you, you having this chat, but also I just, I, in preparation for this, I spent a little time kind of reacquainting myself with, with your work. Some of which has always been part of my favorites. But some
        of it, particular, your solo albums are relatively new to me and just really enjoying the work. Right. Gosh, thank </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jeff: </b>
      You so much. I really appreciate that.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Yeah. Why don't, why don't you tell us kind of, we'll talk about your whole, the breadth of your history, but why don't you just kind of fill us in on the stuff that you're working on right now? Oh, sure. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jeff: </b>
      At the moment I've, I've gotten much deeper into scoring video games and a partner of mine. And I have started up a little project called Imperia and we are scoring and doing sound design and doing a coding implementation for games. We've just
      got that started last year or just before COVID and what I like to call the before times. So there's been a lot of that. I'm scoring a television series. I'm putting the final, final touches on my third solo album, which has a full orchestra as
      well as, you know, various electronics and some vocals. But, it's the first time I've tried blending or Kestrel sounds with electronic sounds on a solo project. I've obviously done it for years and years and years, film and TV writing for
      orchestra and, and electronics. So it's nice. It's nice to do that.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jeff: </b>
      And then finally, I am writing, the third and <span style="color:red" data-ts="184.84" data-end_ts="185.35" title="184.84" id=c_"184.84">__fact__</span>, I, I trust me final edition of my book on film scoring called the real world, R E E L.
      And, you know, I wrote it and it started off as a series of articles and keyboard magazine when I was just getting started. And, the original book is really a memoir. It's really a very personal view of how I got started and all the mistakes I
      made and all the pitfalls and, you know, all the cautionary tales, with, with a little bit of humor, I hope. And, and then the book was rereleased in 2010 with a whole new section on technology. And now I've rewritten the book less from my sort
      of perspective of naivete because I can't pull that off anymore and right. And it's really a much more practical guide and it includes a fairly substantial section on, how, video games are scored, and comparing and contrasting with film and
      television. So writing, you know, some scoring in a game scoring, I'm working on a television series right now. That'll be out next year and I'm finishing the book and all is swapping out modules on my, on my, on my Eurorack. And I'm figuring
      out why something is
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Well, that's, that's actually the hobby part of any musician's life is figuring out what's not working. Right. And that's the pose.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>So I'm kind of curious, it sounds to me like given the different things that you're doing, you kind of have to do a lot of context switching. I would think that that sort of like doing scoring for a TV series is different than directing a
        movie, which is different than writing a book, which is different than, I mean, some of the other stuff that you've done over the years, you've done sound design. You're talking about doing a video game work where there's actually like code
        implementation. <span style="color:red" data-ts="304.59" data-end_ts="304.8" title="304.59" id=c_"304.59">__Is__</span> that, is that, are you literally talking about getting to the point where it's implementing some of the, some of the code
        that goes in <span style="color:red" data-ts="310.54" data-end_ts="310.59" title="310.54" id=c_"310.54">__the__</span> game? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jeff: </b>
      Thank God. I'm not doing that part, but we have a couple of people who are really good at it. So I'm just involved. Well, I sort of run the show and, I'm scoring, I'm writing music on, on two games.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>So how do you cope? How do you cope with the, with the context switching of that, that, that seems like that'd be really difficult, </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jeff: </b>
      You know, it, it, it sounds worse than it is I suppose, but, I guess ultimately what may be defines me and, and what connects all of these, what seemed like very disparate dots is just that I, I was born with and continue to have an insatiable
      curiosity and everything I do. I do to that in some way, even writing music, you know, writing a score or working on a solo project to me is, is a series of questions. You know, what would happen if, you know, what would it sound like if I
      enjoy communicating, you know, to me the whole idea of pop culture, whether it's a game or a film or TV show, is that it's a shared emotional experience. And at the end of the day, what a composer does and frankly what everybody involved does,
      but I think it's unusual and special with music is that it's all about creating experiences.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jeff: </b>
      It's about creating, not creating an emotion, but creating a space in which the audience can have an emotion. So I'm in the business, if you will, of creating experiences, which I think is what art is in general. It's, it's what a pop culture
      is. It's what film is. It's what games are. So, I mean, yeah, you know, doing one thing is different than doing another, but for me, I'm just scratching the same itches that I've scratched in, in my whole personal life and, and musical life
      professional life, which is just gee, I wonder what it would be like to do that, you know.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Right, right. Well, you open the door right there. So I'm going to walk right through it, which is talking about your background. I, I love this idea of a life of curiosity and, you know, it's sort of the Trek at trying to resolve that
        curiosity. Tell me, tell me a little bit about where you're coming from. You know, what, what is your background? What, what did you come up like as a band kid through school? Did you study music or what, what, what is the way that you went
        through the early years that set you up to be somebody who clearly is comfortable with music, comfortable with technology, comfortable with writing, comfortable with conversations with other artists? I mean, these are, this is a complex
        matrix of things that you have to negotiate. I'm curious where that person comes from. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jeff: </b>
      Well, first of all, here I am in Los Angeles and this is where I was born. I'm I'm from here. You know, I'm first generation, my parents were immigrants and were very, they loved music. They didn't really play. My father was an amateur violin
      player and didn't play very often, but he loved to collect records. And so I grew up listening to classical music and few other things. There wasn't really a lot of pop music growing up. My, I have an older brother and sister who, who listened
      to some pop stuff, but, I think from an early age, I was kind of drawn to a fairly eclectic range of musical influences from jazz and prog rock and pop and, classical and avant-garde classical. And Wendy Carlos is a switched on Bach and her
      film scores. And so, and I played a, I was a flute player in school, you know, it was literally the only instrument left to be checked out.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jeff: </b>
      So there it was my, my, my, my one shot being able to sit next to that cute girl in band, you know, so it's going to have to be flute. So, by the time I was in high school, I was writing and arranging, pieces. So I could have a band and do do
      some things, musically, little bit of writing, composing, but wasn't really thinking about it. I was getting deeper into jazz and, and I had my, my music teacher was a member of a, of a jazz band. That meant a lot to me, which was, a trumpet
      player named Don Ellis here in LA, also here in Los Angeles who played quarter-tone trumpet and had this ultra avant-garde big band drawing influences from Bulgarian music and Indian raga. And he had a electric string court, Ted French horns,
      and quarter-tone trumpets. And I love this stuff. And then I got to study with his, his lead, a woodwind player, and then eventually his keyboard player, the Bulgarian jazz pianist Milcho levy of became my teacher, in exchange for being his
      cartridge guy with his fender Rhodes, which utterly destroyed the inside of my car. But, but it's how it got destroyed.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Your love of probably destroyed your love of the fender Rhodes. Oh yeah. I can't look at one now. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jeff: </b>
      And, and, you know, by the time I finished high school, I had no interest whatsoever in being a musician. I actually ended up going to college as a fine arts major. I was studying. I'd also grown up as a photographer with a dark room and, and a
      love and, and a, a relative of mine, a close relative was a very, very successful photographer, also here in Los Angeles. And he used to teach me, so I went to college, doing that, but, all this always doing music. And, it was, it was in the
      very beginning of college versus things started to kind of click number one. I ended up with a, kind of a random roommate who was an, had an utter love of soundtracks. And I had no inkling of, of film music at the time. And, he had this big
      collection of soundtracks.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jeff: </b>
      And the first one I, he, I listened to was a score by Jerry Goldsmith for a, kind of a B-movie called Logan's run, which has done with orchestra and his AARP 2,500. And it was really, really cool. And, I didn't forget that, around the same
      time, this little camp, this little local university that I went to here in LA, a Cal state college, got a grant to make a purchase for serial number one of a digital musical instrument that was simply called the Dartmouth project and a group
      of, of young professors. And grad students came out to install this fairly substantial computer system. You know, this is a long time ago. So the computer was massive given, given what it could do, but it was an algorithmic composition system
      where you actually could write code and build <span style="color:red" data-ts="738.97" data-end_ts="739.75" title="738.97" id=c_"738.97">__tambour__</span> and build compositions. It was run by Jon Appleton, Sydney Alonzo, and the grad student
      who was mostly in charge of the coding, was a guy named Peter nigh, who was, I think Pixar's, employee number one.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jeff: </b>
      Cause he, and he had helped develop the sound droid at, <span style="color:red" data-ts="760.18" data-end_ts="760.39" title="760.18" id=c_"760.18">__cause__</span>. So they installed it, they got it up and running. They showed it to me. I was
      fascinated. And then it was Christmas vacation and I just could not be away from this thing. So I stole a copy of the key and slept in the music building of my college for a while and taught myself how to program this, this language. And it was
      using a form of FM synthesis as well as some other techniques, but you could do some really radical things with it. And I got into doing a blend of digital with some tape manipulation and, you know, taking it into some unexpected territories
      and, and that was pretty regulatory cause it was my first time typing, you know, code into a, into a computer terminal college didn't work out for me.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jeff: </b>
      I dropped out and I ended up for four years writing code and developing instruments for Roland. One of the few Americans who was actually writing a software and doing, development. And I, and I went to Japan to do some of that, did that for
      four years. During that time MIDI came about 1984. I got very involved in that, but eventually I got, I, I be honest, I, I was incredibly
      unhappy because I wasn't making music. I was helping other people make music. And you know, I was still writing music. I was just doing avant garde experimental electronic music with what few instruments I could. I had a little at a small, a
      role in modular that I was able to get, cheaply and that Jupiter eight behind me and a few other things. And this, this gentleman who had mug modular serial number two, gave me a key to his house and he said, I'm not using it.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jeff: </b>
      You use it. So I was writing for dance ensembles and choreographers, and that was great. I w I was getting a lot of ideas out of my system and I was scoring little student films and little experimental films and short films. So I had a little
      hand in that little hand working also with other artists doing gallery installations and doing interactive, or spatial sound, installations. But by the, by the end of four years, I was really just chomping at the bit to do my own thing. So, a
      couple people had expressed an interest in having me do sampling, and I was one of the first guys here in LA to do, to get deeply into sampling. And, I was doing a secret behind the scenes project for Fairlight, for their, about to be released,
      for like three. And I developed a fair amount of content for that, along with Roland's very first sampler, which was at a similar time.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jeff: </b>
      So I became, a studio gun for hire here in LA. And I started with programming, a synth sounds for music studio musicians. Eventually they recommended me to some record producers. And I started working with guys in the rock world. I was working
      with Alby gluten who produced the BGS and the Eagles. And I had a long time working with Maurice white from earth, wind, and fire, and thought that was an amazing education because he was a consummate producer and the attention to detail and
      finesse and understanding kind of the spectral range of music from his perspective as a drummer even was, was pretty profound. I spent a couple of years working with Malcolm, Cecil and Tonto at the time was here in Los Angeles. So he would let
      me come and play with Tonto up in Topanga canyon. And eventually after working with those and a number of other record producers working on albums, eventually I realized that I had become sort of unknowingly.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jeff: </b>
      I'd become a sound designer for film composers and television composers. And to be honest, some of them were a little older and electronic music. Now we're getting close to 1990. Electronic music was a little challenging for them. You know,
      there was just an explosion in synthesizers that were a little more affordable and middy and Dawes and samplers that weren't, you know, five figures. So I started programming on a lot of movies for a lot of composers, and that's where I met
      mark <span style="color:red" data-ts="1013.9" data-end_ts="1014.5" title="1013.9" id=c_"1013.9">__***<inaudible>***__</span> and worked with him for a number of years. And that's where I met Hans Zimmer, who was absolutely critical to my, to
      my, career as a composer, as a sound designer for him. But eventually I became a ghost writer and I spent years writing on scores without my name on it. And, which is a great education. That is, that was college for me, was doing all the ghost
      writing, but then eventually, actually both mark Isom and Hans Zimmer recommended me for my first, what ended up being my first television series and my first feature film. And then I've been a composer since
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Man, there's, I've got like about a hundred questions of the stuff. So I'm going to try and limit it to the ones that are just really poking Nina. Okay. First of all, I'm really curious about the Dartmouth project. It sounds like a very
        fascinating thing, but it also sounds like something that could have been developed two weeks ago, let alone, you know, developed, what this would have been 1980. I'm guessing pretty close to that. Yeah. Something like that. Yeah. You
        embedded yourself in this thing over Christmas vacation and you, it sounds like you kind of took the opportunity to, to, bring together a lot of things, you know, fire up tape recorders and do some tape tape manipulation, but also learning
        the coding aspect of this. What, how much of that ended up being sort of like the thing that, the thing that got stuck in the back of your head, so that later on were when you started getting back in or getting into sound design and stuff
        like that, you had that to draw on? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jeff: </b>
      Well that could, that could be a long answer as well. You know, being probably one of the very first people on the west coast of the United States to work on, to work with a digital synthesizer and a digital programming language was an amazing
      experience. It was crude, it was problematic. We, we were kind of the beta team in a sense, eventually it became, it was sold and it became the Synclavier.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Yeah. Obviously with Jon Appleton evolved, </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jeff: </b>
      Right? So it became new England digital. And then after a few iterations, it became the Synclavier. So this was the prototype really, you know, it got me started. And one night I was at a, at a concert in a little theater here in LA, and I, I
      overheard a conversation behind me, a man talking about teaching a computer to improvise <span style="color:red" data-ts="1168.07" data-end_ts="1168.51" title="1168.07" id=c_"1168.07">__temporize__</span> music. And I thought I got to talk to
      this guy and I turned around and I introduced myself, actually, this, this became an important, part two, I, that I left out that, meeting this guy, Ray <span style="color:red" data-ts="1180.4" data-end_ts="1181.06" title="1180.4"
        id=c_"1180.4">__Jergens__</span>, who was a jet propulsion laboratory space scientist, an actual rocket scientist and his passion for music. And in his spare time, he created a language to improvise and send music through voltages and
      triggers. So we were working with analog synthesizers and he became my mentor.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jeff: </b>
      And because of that, if it wasn't for him, I wouldn't have gotten the job at Roland, but it wasn't for the job at Roland. I wouldn't have gotten a shot at studio work, you know, doing sampling and programming and sequencing and, just, you know,
      becoming this, this general digital gun for hire. And if it wasn't for that, I wouldn't have gotten involved in MIDI. And, if it wasn't for that,
      I wouldn't have gotten involved, in the early days of Max programming, which became a part of, of my, of my career working with Max on some
      films. I probably did some one on one or the first, or I think probably the first major film done using Max at least to some extent, which was for Steven Soderbergh. It was a movie called Kafka with Joel gray and, with Jeremy irons, that was a
      very experimental score and it wouldn't have happened without Max and then Max, I programmed some different, ideas and algorithms to use in the movie traffic, which was just great. She <span style="color:red" data-ts="1271.22"
        data-end_ts="1271.34" title="1271.22" id=c_"1271.22">__was__</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>One of my favorite, it's one of my favorite soundtracks in the history of soundtracks. I love that thing. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jeff: </b>
      I'm very fond of that score as well. And that was, you know, a number of years that I spent working and becoming very close with my still very dear friend, cliff Martinez, it's all about being open-minded, you know, it's and again, it's that
      curiosity of, well, what if we let Max make, you know, make some decisions here and what if we use Max to, you know, mango some, some audio in some unexpected ways. And if we like it, we like it. If we don't, we throw it out.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Yeah. I think, I think a lot of people would be curious on, because it was more than just Sonic manipulation. You were actually, you're saying you were actually using it for some of the compositional algorithmic compositional process that
        that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1320.99" data-end_ts="1321.11" title="1320.99" id=c_"1320.99">__was__</span> available. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jeff: </b>
      The few different functions, you know, with the first movie Kafka, it was patterned after Eastern European gypsy folk music, but done with really avant-garde sources. But, cliff who's a drummer because he was the original drummer in the red hot
      chili peppers. Doesn't play keyboards, doesn't play any thing more than he plays drums. And he had a, a mini drum pad. Got it. And so I wrote an, a Max patch that would allow us to insert scales and melodic material Intuit and with some, with
      some randomness, some potential variations, so that cliff could play these really complicated, really ripping fast rhythm patterns with sticks on and, you know, and different pads took on different, functions for, for the, for the algorithm.
      But ultimately we created something that for, for some people sounds incredibly convincing as Eastern European, gypsy folk music, but it also led us to start taking that and deconstructing it into parts of the, of the background. So that sounds
      would manipulate and shift and, and morph in, in collaboration between the computer and what we want. And then some parts of it were purely deterministic of just taking weird sounds and putting them in the sampling, playing around.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Yeah, I was, I was curious what sort of like the balance of work would have been, because again, like, like you say, cliffs and amazing precautious, but I don't necessarily think of him as like a guy who's going to sit down with a keyboard
        and again, I'm second rate player at best you say that, but I'll tell you, there are some, there are some things that, to me, when I listened to it really represent your music. And I think some of them might go back even to, you did a set of
        loop libraries for, I think it was liquid cinema or something like that way back when, I think it was called pro song maybe, but it was called liquid cinema or something like that. But, that was that I remember I loved those things and it was
        all, but it's something that I remember kind of thinking about as sort of like a stamp of your work, which is you tend to do stuff that's very pro <span style="color:red" data-ts="1468.76" data-end_ts="1469.72" title="1468.76"
          id=c_"1468.76">__costive__</span>, but not always drum like right. Which is weird, which I find fascinating. And, but I also find whenever I try doing something like that, it either sounds like really poorly done drumming or really poorly,
        poorly done bongo </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jeff: </b>
      Players. I just, I totally get. But from the same thing, you, you have no idea the lengths that I've gone to over the years to avoid being a drum programmer, even though I used to do it professionally for other people.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Sure. How do you pull that apart? I mean, on one hand I listened to, and I'm like, I can imagine you were like on an MPC or something playing, but you also weave a lot of variation. You Lee Reeve a lot of synthesis in processing into the
        sound. So then it makes me think, well, maybe it's, maybe it's a different process that I can't even imagine. How do you go about creating these like really percussive, percussion driven track? </i>
    </p>

      Oh, well, I always feel that if you, if you work with more traditional drum sounds say samples of drum sets and percussion instruments, you know, sounds that we know, and we connect with as part of rock or Latin music or world music, Tableau,
      whatever it is once you, once you work with the real sounds, then there's a little bit of an expectation of what you're going to do with those sounds musically. And, you know, certainly I have a friend who's a very, you know, a first rate <span
        style="color:red" data-ts="1565.56" data-end_ts="1565.89" title="1565.56" id=c_"1565.56">__Tabo__</span> player who taught me enough that I could do some programming on a, on a score, a couple of scores where I wanted the topless to sound
      really good. Occasionally I would just hire a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1574.92" data-end_ts="1575.28" title="1574.92" id=c_"1574.92">__tablet__</span> player and that solves an enormous number of problems. But, you know, I, as sound
      manipulation has gotten easier and faster than it used to be with tape manipulation, my ability, my interest, and desire to take, samples or work with found sounds and start building from there and working with loops.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jeff: </b>
      And then for example, I, for a long time, my, my favorite go-to technique was to take Toms and run them through harmonizers. So that each time hit was actually playing a kind of a chord in, in one sense, it makes it kind of deeper and bigger,
      and it's a more cinematic sound, but it's also an unexpected sound. And I'd been, you know, I spent a couple of years, in John <span style="color:red" data-ts="1622.94" data-end_ts="1623.54" title="1622.94" id=c_"1622.94">__Hassell's__</span>
      band as his keyboard player and electronic percussion and, co-writing and co-producing, and he made the use of the harmonizer in his trumpet, his signature sound. And I did it my own way with my woodwind instruments. I have on hundreds of cues
      that I've written for film and television played, you know, different wooden flutes, ethnic flutes, or just my regular flute or Alto flute, but running, you know, running it through different harmonizer patterns and, and some intelligent
      harmonizers are just straight up pitch shifters. And so that, that interest in creating these unexpected harmonic nuances ended up being really cool in, in, in drums and percussion. So, you know, there's that, you know, spending time just on
      modular rigs to, to develop, percussion sounds, Max and Reaktor became really valuable instruments for experimenting with mucking up, not just drum sounds, but, drum patterns, you know, percussion patterns. So I'm, I'm, I'm a big fan of
      interactive drum programming. I'll I'll, I'll do the first half and I'm going to let the computer do the second.

      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Sure, sure. Now I'm curious, I am in a lucky position of being able to, to get a glimpse of your studio there, by </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jeff: </b>
      The way, I see the ARP 26 behind you, and you can't see it, but right there where I'm pointing, that is the bottom edge of my ARP, 2,600. Nice, good. So yeah, 2,600
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Forever, but what's interesting is I look around your studio and it's, most, most of the gear, is analog gear. I, from what I can tell other than the, the beat step pro it's all analog gear from what I see, which brings me to a different
        point, very different from when you were working as a studio gun for Maurice white and some of these people, you know, back then you got to be a studio person because you had the play, but you also have to have real facility in gear like
        samplers, like the EMU sampler, or, you know, Lin drum or some of these kinds of things. Right. You were talking about like the harmonizer as sort of like a studio, a critical piece of studio gear. A lot of those things have kind of
        evaporated into the box, right? Yeah. Do you have any fondness for the hardware implementation? So those </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jeff: </b>
      Are really I'm done. I hung that up so long ago. I mean, I only got into modular. Well, I mean, I go in and out of modular, I'll buy a rig, sell it, buy another one, sell it, honestly, in my world, especially with film and television, you're
      on, you're on the clock and your creativity is limited not by what you can do by, but by what you can do by the end of the day day. Right? So my, my whole history has been how to be as efficient as possible without losing anything in the way of
      creativity. And frankly, being an audio file goes is so low on the list. You can barely see it. I don't really care. I don't really have a big interest in the emulation and simulation of analog equipment by plugins. I mean, it's great, but I
      don't get it.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jeff: </b>
      I just want really excellent control and just good sound quality out of, out of a plugin. And I'm happy I was working on a movie back when I was working with Hans Zimmer called Blackhawk down. It was a Ridley Scott movie, and, you know, I was
      tasked with scoring a few scenes in that and I just made it my, my position that I'm going to do it in the box a hundred percent. This was in 2000. Hadn't really been done before on a major film. We were all still using mixing consoles and
      outboard samplers and reverbs. And I said, no, whatever I can do in the box is going to be in that movie. And I did quite a lot that that's in the film. And I think it's the first music in a, in a major film that never passed through a wire.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jeff: </b>
      And, and, and I'll be honest with you. That's how it's been for me since I find the world of plug-ins both compositionally and, and Timberly far more interesting to me, granular synthesis, whatever, whatever gives me the opportunity to explore
      and then create and lock it in. That's what I want. And I, and I'm not a purist about it. The reason I I'm back into modular is it's, it's a different way to make music and, and, you know, the tools influence the end result, the history of art
      has technology built into it. And it starts with the ink used in cave paintings, you know, indelible ink, which led to paint and led to working in, in so many ways. The, the, the advancements of art are linked to science. And it's true in, in
      visual arts. It's certainly true the advent of motion picture and going from analog to digital video games going from eight bit two to 64 bit technology has opened up creative avenues for you and me for artists.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jeff: </b>
      And I relish that tremendously. So I will use technology because it makes me think and act a certain way. The modular does that for me, certainly the world of plugins, the world of Max or Reaktor, all, all of that is about finding inspiration
      in, in ways that will create something unique. And hopefully by me being the filter of what I think ends up being a good experiment or a good result from an experiment or a bad one is sort of what defines what my music is. You know, I'm the
      creator, but really I'm also the filter. And my particular brand of filtration is a big part of what creates something that sounds like, like me, if that's a thing.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Sure. That makes sense. The one thing I would say is that, that filtration process, and I've heard it, you in, you know, the interviews talk about the importance of like the happy accidents as part of, as part of your work development,
        right? Yeah. You </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Of course, but I'm curious, how do you, to me, one of the things that's different between a piece of hardware and a piece of software is that software because you're interacting with it with Molson. So like that tends to be, at least I seem
        to approach it at a much more intellectual level where when I'm working with a piece of hardware with knobs and controls, it's a much more visceral and, different kinds of sensitivity, you know, you know, well, how, what do you do to sort of
        like break that down, especially when part of your goal is to make sure that you have efficiency and speed at the center of what you're doing </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jeff: </b>
      Well, you know, at the core of every project is a goal and the goal is the experience like we were talking about before. Right? Right. And in collaboration with a creative partner, whether it's a producer, a director or a game audio director,
      there's a conversation about style and that old notion that there's only five stories in every movie and every TV shows based on the five stories of the hero's journey and the, you know, the, you know, the love, arc is fairly true. There's a
      very limited number of stories to be told, but the manner in which we tell them is truly infinite. And just as there's an infinite number of ways to tell a story on screen, there's an infinite number of ways to express the underlying emotion of
      that story musically, in a way that meshes with what's going on visually.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jeff: </b>
      So at the top of my hierarchy of importance is how can I do musical that reflect on the story, the characters, but the style in which the story is told and at a very practical level, the expectations and the desires of my director. So sometimes
      they say, I want something more conventional, whereas my piano, you know, or my strings, it doesn't matter. If somebody says I want something completely unusual and unexpected, well that's music to my ears to say the least. And, I'm happy to do
      that. Every project I start usually starts with many days of just experimenting with no goal at all. It's not about writing that first theme or tune it's about building the, the Sonic world that that score is going to exist in. And, and it's
      probably the most important step of, of writing any kind of score is to build the pallet.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jeff: </b>
      That's going to create that score. And the palette is both in terms of tambour and color in terms of rhythm, in terms of what tools have I chosen to assist me. And because the sounds that I create will then turn around and inspire me,
      compositionally, you know, every synthesizer programmer or player knows every electronic musician knows that you come up with a sound and then the sound tells you how to play it. That is, that is just as true with a piano and a string quartet.
      You can't write the same for string quartet as you do for piano. You <span style="color:red" data-ts="2230.2" data-end_ts="2230.29" title="2230.2" id=c_"2230.2">__get__</span>, you get an inferior result when you write for the sound and for
      the, you know, the polyphony of a piano versus the polyphony of a string quartet, you end up with just very different things. So I'm not only setting up sounds, I'm setting up a process and I'll spend a lot of time developing sounds, going out
      and sampling things, manipulating samples, building kits of, of, of sounds and loops, deciding to maybe experiment with a new plugin that maybe does something that no plugin has done before.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jeff: </b>
      Using my, bringing in my iPad, I've just, just for Sonic manipulation, cause there's a lot of great, you know, iOS audio stuff out there. That's very experimental. And I, I love all of that. So I build this environment, but I keep it limited.
      You know, if it's too massive, then every piece you write will sound the same. You know, it just, it's, it's white noise. It's every possibility, you know, simultaneously for me, I build into my initial concept, extreme limitation. You know,
      I'm only gonna work with these six sounds or these 20 sounds, or I'm going to stick to working in certain metric ideas or certain <span style="color:red" data-ts="2307.21" data-end_ts="2307.63" title="2307.21" id=c_"2307.21">__tangible__</span>
      ideas or do something in, in Reaktor or Max. I don't really use Max much anymore cause I don't use Ableton and it's just as an integrate anymore. So that it's just part of the process, be an instrument maker, then be the composer who writes for
      those instruments then decide what works, what doesn't start sharing it with the other people you're working with and see what, what rises to the top
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Rinse and repeat. Does that, does that work for projects like your solo albums as well as film and TV? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jeff: </b>
      Yes and no. The first album that I put out was only in 2017, just just a few years ago. And that actually started off because I had worked on a, on a Brazilian film shot in the Amazon and they sent me all these field recordings that were
      incredible boats on the river, birds, insects, wind, you name it. And they gave me hours of these field recordings. And the bulk of that score was written purely by manipulating field recordings and making the score. So there were no, there
      were no synthesizers used and really no conventional instruments. I think one time, once or twice a little piano was sort of walked through there, but it was really a purely textual score. And I was, you know, auto tuning birds and, and
      creating very constricted tonal ideas that those, some of the pieces I wrote for that film became the springboard for that first album projector.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jeff: </b>
      Interesting. So the projector album does have some electronic instruments and some acoustic instruments and some of it's with this, British cellist, Peter Gregson, who's a brilliant, brilliant musician, few guitar players, David Julian, who did
      the Momento score plays on, on the, on the album, but it really started as these Sonic ideas, but on a score, I am always beholdened to what other people need and want. Even a soundtrack album is still very derivative of somebody else's vision
      that I am assisting in the completion of that vision. Even though every note is mine, it was created at the behest of, but when I did my first album, I thought there are things that I want to express musically that I just can't in a score, but
      I love these, these initial pieces, these sketches that I'd written for this, for this film, this Brazilian film, and that, that became the impetus, the, the second album vapor, which just came out this year, not to sound like a cliche, and
      I've heard it on your show already.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Jeff: </b>
      It's, it's absolutely my COVID album. So, you know, quarantine hit and like every artist I know the first few months where this were exhilarating, leave me alone. I'm going to be in my studio because I literally can't leave. And it was at that
      time, I decided to completely redo my modular rig. And I had decided that I was going to get rid of, okay, we're going to lose an endorsement here, I suppose, to get rid of every Doepfer module in the rack, because they are purely conventional
      modules. They are basically just a mode synthesizer, you know, in, in modular form. And there, it doesn't have the same. And I started working, replacing it with some of the great new generation of much more interesting experimental, both
      analog and digital modules. And I hadn't, it's just an explosion of ideas over a very short time. Every morning I would get up and I would just do a, do an improvisation on the, on the modular recorded in multi-track into my door. And then I
      spent the next few months just reworking editing, you know, being again, being the creative filter and that became vapor. So that's, that's a very modular album. It's probably 80 or 90% modular with a few other elements thrown in.
    </p>

      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Wow. Well, Jeff, unfortunately our time is up, but before we go, I'd like to have you just tell us what's, what's coming up. You mentioned already that you have a, you have a TV series that you're working on. </i>

      out till next year. I guess I'm, I'm planting a lot of seeds right now, Darren. Nice. You know, so a couple of games that'll be out next year. Actually one might be out a game called <span style="color:red" data-ts="2588.29"
        data-end_ts="2589.1" title="2588.29" id=c_"2588.29">__***<inaudible>***__</span>, which is a VR game. So you gotta have, the goggles is coming. My book, my book, the real world third edition will be next year, this television series, which I
      can't really say next year, other games next year. And hopefully before the end of the year will be my next album, which is tentatively called loom L U M E loom. And, it's just putting the final touches on that now. And that actually has a full
      orchestra as well as the modular and vocals. And it's, it's a more ambitious kind of a, it's a very different sound and I'm actually really happy with how it's come out. Amazing.
