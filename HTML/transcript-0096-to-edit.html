<b>Darwin: </b><silence> Well, this week is a kind of a random contact that turned into a really interesting interview, but also probably one of the most distracted interviews that we had. There were kids and dogs and sirens, and, at one point, a bad internet outage that wiped out a little bit of the conversation, but, we muscled through it, and the end result is this really cool interview with John Keston Hope you enjoy. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. This week I am pleased to introduce you to, a fellow. I've met virtually. We've never met face-to-face, although, he lives in an area I go to occasionally, so I'm gonna try. I have to find a way to make it happen. His name's John Keon and, he contacted me a while back and he introduced me to some of his music, and I was frankly, quite blown away. It's kind of that thing that I like, which is, it's electronic, but not overtly. So it's sound designerly. It's a pretty amazing release, and I was really, I was really excited to listen to it and then excited to talk to John about it. So, with that introduction I give you John Ston. Hi, John. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>John Keston: </b>Hi, Darwin I'm really good. Thank you for that, introduction and just, I really appreciate that you enjoy the, the music. It's really fun to produce and, Lister is amazing as well, and he just, he did a really great job on, on some of the production of that, so, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, I just, I just found it really interesting to hear something, you know, and, and I am, I'm being quite serious in that in the front end because it seems so often when people do work and people who describe themselves as being interested or focused on sound design, when they do a work that's about sound design, it, it, a lot of times it really sounds like, Hey, look at me, look at my fabulous design almost as I, I would say the parallel is like, people who are really good, visual effects people when they make a movie, it's all about the visual effects, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, yeah. For some reason in this thing, it was, the, the wonderful sound design, but it just kind of really slotted itself in nicely, and it didn't, it didn't have that look at me quality to it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b>Yeah. I think, I think one of the things I do with, and I, I've always been a, a fan of like monos <span style="color:red" data-ts="156.055" data-end_ts="156.135" title="156.055" id=c_"156.055">__sense__</span>, and I've had vintage monos synths for, a long time. And I, you know, I play roads, I play piano, but, the thing about a monos synth that I like is you've got the whole, the whole array of controls are right there. And I never even use patches. I have a, a MOG sub 37, and I've dialed in one patch that is sort of my starting place for everything else. Instead of like, you know, oh, maybe for this song I'll use this patch and this song will use this patch, I'll, I'll just start with that patch, and then if I need to change it, then I, I know where to go. You know what I'm saying? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. That's, that's actually a lot of how I use the modular, especially when I'm performing live, is that, it, it really represents the lack of presets, but a stable starting point that is comfortable Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and, and that that's a neat way to work. So why don't we kick this off by having you sort of identify yourself. 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b>Okay. Yeah, I think there's a number of facets. Like I definitely first of all identify as, as a musician, and one of the things that's happened is, you know, like throughout my life, music hasn't really paid me a whole lot of money. I don't know if you can identify with that <laugh>. But, you know, I, I haven't made a whole lot of <span style="color:red" data-ts="235.645" data-end_ts="235.765" title="235.645" id=c_"235.645">__money__</span>. I mean, I, I still consider myself professional. I do make money at times, but it's not enough to, you know, live on. And so I've, I've been doing other things, and one of the things I got involved in early on was computer science. So I was, I studied computer science for a little while in college. I never finished my CSS degree. I went into music technology, and that's when I got my ba. But, because of the starting off in computer science, I ended up, you know, doing, doing, sort of software gigs as a, basically as a way to support music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b>And, I ended up doing a lot of web technology stuff and, that led me into education, later on. And so I started teaching this stuff interaction and, and a lot of like motion scripting kinds of things. And I was always interested about how, you know, once I started teaching this stuff, how it was all really focused on visuals and there wasn't as much sound going on within, you know, this, this sort of <span style="color:red" data-ts="298.045" data-end_ts="298.245" title="298.045" id=c_"298.045">__interact__</span> interactive software realm. So, so I started looking into that and saying, well, why isn't that the case? And I started doing things that were more involved with sound. So I sort of secondarily, you know, identify as a software, developer or, you know, sort of as this computer programmer guy who wants to, you know, make things that can help with making music, you know? Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, it seems like you and I actually kind run along parallel tracks a little bit, because that's kind of my story too. The, you know, especially if you, if you sort of have, like, in my case, I generated a family fairly early, so that had some financial requirements to it. But it, it's interesting how at the time that I, I started doing the coding thing, there was not much of a matchup between music and computer programming, and where there was, was kind of the wild, wild west, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And, that certainly isn't the case anymore. And like now, I, I teach in an art department at a school, but I teach sound art, which is really interesting. And, creative coding, which is also really interesting. All things that weren't even on anyone's radar a few years ago. And I think it's, it is pretty amazing that kind of the doors of opportunities swung and I happened to be in a place to step through. What was the mechanism that swung the doors open for you? Is it just <span style="color:red" data-ts="386.555" data-end_ts="386.845" title="386.555" id=c_"386.555">__were__</span>, because you're teaching now, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b>Yeah. And I think that's, that really was the opportunity for me was, was getting involved in teaching. Because, because before that, you know, the, the programming gigs were more or less, you know, okay, well, I know how to do this stuff, and so it is paying the bills, and then I can, you know, go play gigs at night. And I, I play, I've consistently played, performed, you know, like somewhere between two and four times a month, you know, with, with various projects. And so I'm always doing that, but that's never enough to really live on. But when I started teaching it sort of, you know, I, I had, I'd been using computers. I mean, my first computer was like a Commodore 64, and I actually did MIDI with that, with this software called Sonos Super Sequencer. It had eight tracks of midi, and one of my first synths was a Corg Poly 800, and I would hook up the Corg Poly 800 to this and like layer as many tracks as it would do polyphonically and just create these, these kind of bizarre classical compositions when I was a kid. But, you know, I left that alone for a while because, you know, the music thing was I was more focused on technique as a musician, right. Yet I still had this sort of interest in technology, and then I was working in technology, but not until I started teaching did I really sort of start to say, Hey, I wanna combine these things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see. That's 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b>Interesting. You know, and start, because suddenly I didn't have this pressure on me to be, you know, on the computer all day, you know, making stuff for other people. Now I was, you know, using computers in the teaching, but it freed me up to sort of like, explore other areas and that could contribute to my teaching practice as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Got it. Right. So one of the things when I did a little research on you, I saw that, this idea of sort of like mixing and matching, sound and music to art kind of as a two-way street. So you, on one hand, you are bringing music to, to sort of like the visual arts world, but I also noticed that I think it was your MFA thesis. And subsequent to that, you've done things with graphical scores, and I'm fascinated with graph graphical scores in different ways of scoring performance. And, tell me a little bit about your approach to that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b>Now, I would say, one of the major influences for me in that regard was one of my former professors during undergrad, I'm not sure if you know him, but his name is, Dr. David means Oh, yes. And, so he's done some amazing things with, you know, he has a, a <span style="color:red" data-ts="551.885" data-end_ts="552.005" title="551.885" id=c_"551.885">__dis__</span> background in architecture, and so does these, beautiful architectural kind of visual or graphical scores. And, I think my approach to it has been not necessarily in, in that tradition, but, doing things with, my, I guess one, one of the main things I wanted to do <span style="color:red" data-ts="574.845" data-end_ts="575.045" title="574.845" id=c_"574.845">__is__</span> do an audio visual score. And so if you think of an audio visual score, well, it's not just, it's not just, a graphical score, and it's not notation, but it's like sound and visuals combined, and that's what you're responding to as an improviser, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b>Right. And so I, I started doing some experiments in grad school where I would, take like my, corg, monotube and a field recorder and go and sit next to a train and set up a binaural microphone, and then I would record the binaural microphone and, listen to what was coming into the binaural microphone through headphones, and then bring in like monophonic synthesizer lines and start manipulating that, sort of in a response to what was happening with the, sound in the environment. And I would shoot that on video as well, and then put the binaural sound mixed together into the video. And, so this is, so for me, the idea was that the environment was sort of the audio visual score. I see. Right. Okay. And so it's, you know, one of the things I love doing as a musician is improvising. 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b>And I work in with a number of different groups who do, free improvisation. And, and for me, this is another way to kind of improvise, but there's this whole idea of, you know, we're, we're receiving all this information with our senses, and there's this idea of phon esis, which is essentially imagining sound. Okay. So we all imagine sound, right? I mean, it's like, but this is just a technical word that's been put on it. But you know, how we imagine sound, why we imagine sound is really based on kind of what sort of sensory stimuli that we're experiencing. And so I'd put myself in these positions and say, okay, well, what kind of sounds would I imagine that would go along with this? And then just try to do it on the spot and mix it in and sort of perform that. In the case of the, duets that I did with the singing Ringing Tree in northern England, this is a sculpture, on a hill in northern England that's made of these galvanized metal pipes. And they're in this incredible arrangement, this architectural firm called Tonkin <span style="color:red" data-ts="711.385" data-end_ts="711.605" title="711.385" id=c_"711.385">__Liu__</span> built this sculpture as a series as one in a series of panopticons, throughout England. And it's just gorgeous, and it's on this hill. And as the wind blows past all of these galvanized horizontal tubes, they're sort of in these spiral kind of arrangements. All of these different tones happen. Right. And they're sort of microtonal, they're not really pitched, and I don't think they could be pitched perfectly because the wind speeds change so frequently. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sos it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="743.765" data-end_ts="743.845" title="743.765" id=c_"743.765">__gonna__</span> change the sound by insulin purpose. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b>And there's all this chaos happening within those frequencies, but it's just beautiful and haunting. And so just being in that environment and listening to it, and then sort of responding to it with, with a synthesizer was, was sort of my goal there. So the audiovisual score itself is that environment, if you look, you know, you, you look at the documentation for the piece, essentially what you're hearing is what I was hearing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>See, while <span style="color:red" data-ts="772.805" data-end_ts="772.925" title="772.805" id=c_"772.805">__I__</span> was there. I see. Well, it's interesting because it's, I'm having, I, I have to say, I'm having trouble wrapping my head around it, because when we talk in terms of like a graphical score, I think I am, I'm actually more inclined to immediately jump to the concepts of your teacher and thinking in terms of architectural, you know, structuring and sort of like the development of things that will remind me, you know, when to repeat and how often repeat. And it's, it's hard for me to wrap my, my brain around the idea of an environment being a score, but of course it can be. And it especially makes a lot of sense then, or it ties together with some other things that I saw you had done in including things like doing live, performances, to, cinema works Yeah. And stuff like that. So it seems like this s improvisational part of you kind of is infused in, in all of it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b>Yeah, I would agree. Yeah. I think, it's, I think it's admitting that there's, you know, when you're improvising, you know, we're, we, we all have an <span style="color:red" data-ts="847.485" data-end_ts="847.805" title="847.485" id=c_"847.485">__influence__</span>. There's some, there's all kinds of influence right? Influences as you're improvising, perhaps other musicians that you're playing with. In, in the case of these scores, it's the environment around, around you, but there's also your own history, right? And there's all the, you know, the background that you have and you know, what, what you've listened to in the past and, you know, all of that thing, all of those things. So there's a whole series of things that sort of, you know, influence how you improvise. And I think these scores are a way to sort of admit that this improvisational process has this impetus. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that actually gives me the opportunity to, sort of pivot into one of the questions I commonly ask people that I'm talking to, which is about your background. I'm, I'm curious because you, I mean, again, I would say that in terms of sort of like background and interest and stuff, you and I have a very parallel track here. I'm curious to know where you came from, you know, what were your early influences? What are the, what are the things that made you the artist that you are today? 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b>You know, I think probably, you know, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention my dad, who's also named John Keon. He was a, an opera singer, and with the Royal Shakespeare Company, I grew up in, in the United Kingdom. We moved to the United States when I was about 10. But, you know, my memories of England were basically hearing my dad sing opera, practice, practice for operas or musicals or whatever he was doing in the house. And we had a piano, and I had piano lessons as a kid for a few years, before we moved to the States. My dad took a teaching job there. I didn't really have much in the way of consistent piano teachers after we moved to this country, but, you know, I was continually listening to music, and my dad had some pretty strange records. He, he, you know, he ended up with, Morton Niks, the Wild Bull was Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b>I think he borrowed it. And I remember listening to that and being like, what is this crazy stuff? <laugh>, you know, as a kid. And then he, he also had like, tam's, Firebird and pictures <span style="color:red" data-ts="981.925" data-end_ts="982.125" title="981.925" id=c_"981.925">__and__</span> an exhibition. And then I had a friend whose dad taught in the art department at the school where my dad en ended up having a job. And he was into my friend's dad was into Laurie Anderson and Jean-Michel <span style="color:red" data-ts="995.705" data-end_ts="995.925" title="995.705" id=c_"995.705">__Jar__</span>. And so I got exposed to that stuff pretty early on. And, then, so throughout high school and I started, you know, just kind of practicing piano and keyboards and playing with a few bands here and there, and just wanting to be better as a musician. And, and then eventually once I, left home, I started getting some sort of coaching, some jazz coaching, and sort of learned some jazz harmony and stuff, and started playing, jazz <span style="color:red" data-ts="1023.285" data-end_ts="1023.365" title="1023.285" id=c_"1023.285">__Stan__</span> standards with people, down in, Minneapolis and which is where I'm based now. And that's kinda was sort of my upbringing and what got me into music, but I was always interested in sound synthesis and sound design. And so I, I could never leave that alone, you know, I always had to be playing around with that stuff. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What were some, what were some of the first ways that you experimented with sound, sound design and playing with sound? Was it synthesizers or was it like tape recorders and stuff? What were the things that got you started in, in playing with it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b>Yeah, I had a, I had a really good friend in, in high school, and we used to make, we used to make, little mystery theaters, you know, recording stuff off of, of records and, and then adding our own dialogue, <laugh>, you know, in grade school. So that was some of the early stuff. But then, you know, I did save up enough, enough money where I think I actually sold a car that I inherited from my grandfather. My family weren't too happy about that <laugh>, but, I sold it to buy, you know, a Corg Poly 800. And so I started experimenting with that before I bought that. I had a Moog Rogue actually, that had a broken key, which I got really cheap, and I would run that through my friend's guitar pedals and, you know, make these whale sounds and <laugh>, you know, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b>With the delay. And I was like, oh my God, this is just incredible. You know, these, these sounds that are coming out of this thing. And so, you know, and then I just kept going from there. And I think the next thing I was doing was playing with AD 50, and that was Roland D 50 was really tricky to program. But, you know, I was at that, at that point. I started, you know, doing technology in the workplace, you know, and, and I was like, you know what? I'm just gonna start practicing piano. And I kind of went in, went in this away from music technology for a little while, and then got back to it later. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. So when you got back into it, I, you know, I'm always curious about people's entree into sort of like, modern production tools and techniques, you know, so, Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> like for me, I, I was away from, from a lot of stuff, and then I came back in still when DOS machines were kind of viable and, you know, was running RA's little sequencer on a PC that was about as powerful as my iPhone is now. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And it was amazing that it could do anything. And I was just in, I was so happy with that. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. What was, when you kind of, when, when you got into music technology, sort of, I mean, obviously in some way it, it's infected you to such that now, you know, you're, you're into it full on. What was the thing, what was the thing that hooked you and, and brought you back in? 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b>I think, I think it's, it was sequencing on computers, you know, like, I think I mentioned earlier, Commodore 64 running Sona, super, super sequencer. Eventually that wasn't really much used to me anymore. But then, eventually I got like an Atari EST and was using Q <span style="color:red" data-ts="1221.445" data-end_ts="1221.725" title="1221.445" id=c_"1221.445">__Base__</span>, right. And then, but then I was like frustrated because I couldn't, I couldn't do <span style="color:red" data-ts="1227.475" data-end_ts="1227.965" title="1227.475" id=c_"1227.475">__digital__</span> audio with that. I could only do MIDI and I love midi, but I wanted to record digital audio. And I, I had a early pc, like 4 80, 6 33 megahertz that I sort of built from parts to, to run this, saw this software called Saw. Right, right. And I had to have a special sound card with it, I think, and that, that's when I first started doing like a digital recording. And I was recording, you know, like roads, electric piano and synth lines and things like that, and then editing stuff together. And that's, that, that really hooked me as well. And just from there, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1263.465" data-end_ts="1263.685" title="1263.465" id=c_"1263.465">__and__</span> I never stopped. I kept building better computers. I went from that into like, sonar, cakewalk, sonar. Right. And then from there, I got hooked on, on Ableton Live. I started on version two of Ableton Live, and I've really been using it and building some max <span style="color:red" data-ts="1279.365" data-end_ts="1279.525" title="1279.365" id=c_"1279.365">__for__</span> live patches and things like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, that's fantastic. That's that's a neat route. 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b>Yeah. Have you used, there's a software called, photo Sounder. Ooh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>No, I haven't heard 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b>That. Yeah, there's this guy, Michael, I think it's, I think his name's pronounced Michael Rusick. And, this software's really great. It's, I've used it, I've used it for a number of projects that, during my thesis, where I would convert the sound to this, you know, spectral analysis and then, and then print that out, perhaps screen print it, then photograph it, and then put it back into photo sounder, and then, and then here the results of how that changed. And so, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1321.825" data-end_ts="1322.045" title="1321.825" id=c_"1321.825">__oh__</span>, interesting kind of process. I did a number of pieces like that. And the most recent one was actually shown, collaborating with this guy, Yahu Stefanski, who's at, VCU. And, it was actually shown at a exhibition in Tokyo. So it was pretty exciting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's really interesting. So I'll have to, I'll have to look into that. That sounds pretty interesting. I mean, I've, I've played around with medicine over the years, which is Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> another one of these kind of mix and match graphical and, and, audio related systems. Although that thing I, I, I didn't get the right PhD <laugh>, I think, to understand that. So that, that one's left me a little bit in a lurch sometimes. I mean, I can make it do squiggly squeal sounds, but I never could seem to get it to do anything intentional. 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b>Yeah. The nice thing about photo sounders, it's really simple. You know, I, I really only use it for translating, the sound into visuals and then manipulating those visuals. One of the experiments I did was taking that sound or that visual, that spectral analysis into Photoshop, and then applying like a glowing edges filter. Oh, right. Which you wouldn't want to use for anything else, right, <laugh>, sure. It actually sounds really cool when you apply glowing edges to spectral analysis and then convert it back into sound again. It's almost like this beautiful chorus kind of sound you get out of it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, that's cool. Well, and, and maybe what you've just done is identified something that, all of all of the people who have these effects setups from 1992, we'll be able to get 'em out of the back closet and use 'em again. Because, you know, like you said, no one's been able to use the glow edges for 20 years without embarrassing themselves. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b>Yeah. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, now one of the things that that kind of implies though is that, you're kind of into this idea of interesting ways of sound degrading. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know, because that, to me, I mean, one of the things that, one of the pieces of, of music that I, and I'm gonna blow it here because I won't be able to remember who it is that did it or, or anything, but, there was this piece of music where it was like, a person recorded, a recorded environmental sound, and that basically kept on sending it back and forth between two cassette recorders. 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b>Are you talking about Alvin Lucier? The, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>No, this is, yeah, I know what you're, think I'm actually thinking of 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b>That's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1469.645" data-end_ts="1469.725" title="1469.645" id=c_"1469.645">__Well__</span>, that's in the room. That's, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I'm thinking, I'm thinking it was somebody, it was a New York thing. It was somehow related to nine 11. And I, again, I'm gonna get, I'm gonna get letters from people that are like, you're an idiot. It's just most important work from that time period or whatever. But, the fact is, it was, it was really interesting because what you end up with is this kind of sense of, of a technology causing a certain type of degradation. And you mentioned Lucius, in a room, which is, that's how a room causes things to degrade. But I think that, that people haven't necessarily been very creative about how computers, cause things to degrade or how you can use computer technologies for this kind of degrading, other than the, like, the most obvious like bit reduction things and stuff like that. Sure. Which, I mean, even those, quite frankly, still sound pretty interesting, and they've been around for a long time. Yeah. But especially when you start talking about these kind of like transmedia, you know, transmedia movements, all of a sudden you have the ability to degrade things in really kind of useful ways. 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b>Yeah. I, that's one of the areas that I love researching. And, one of, one of the experiments I did recently, I wouldn't call it a project yet, but, I bought a Yamaha TX 81 z FM synth. And, these things are, you know, they're notoriously hard to program, of course, because they're just, you know, a, a rack unit. But, there was a editor, a max for live editor that, had been built. And so I jumped off from that. I went into, I opened that up in, in, max <span style="color:red" data-ts="1575.085" data-end_ts="1575.285" title="1575.085" id=c_"1575.085">__four__</span> live and added, sort of this idea of randomizing the parameters, but not just randomizing them and then saying, oh, here's a random patch. But what I did is I set it up so that you could sort of degrade the patch over time. And what was happening is it would pull out of a hat. So I used the earn object in max to Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b>Decide what parameter it was gonna change, and then it would change it, and it would either change it, using interpolation to get to from where it was to where it was over a certain time period. So it would scale it to the new position, or it would just jump to the new position. But you could have these parameters change at a, at a rate that you could set, that you could either clock to the tempo or that you can just use a free running LFO to change at whatever pace that you want. Now, of course, a, a synth that old, like the TTX 81 Z can't really take parameters that fast. So you'll get these mid buffer errors, errors <span style="color:red" data-ts="1638.245" data-end_ts="1638.365" title="1638.245" id=c_"1638.245">__if__</span> you're sending them way too fast. But, just being able to sort of, I, I, the analogy I came up with was like replacing bricks in a wall with like a loaf of bread or a shoe or <laugh>, you know, so you're just, you know, you're degrading this patch over time. What's kind of fun to do is like to play this sound as it's degrading over time and then, you know, and then record that process. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that's actually an interesting idea because that's, first of all, because you're doing it against hardware. And so there again, midi almost acts as this weird technological buffer between your code and what's generating the sound. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But also, so for those people who don't know what the Max <span style="color:red" data-ts="1682.515" data-end_ts="1682.805" title="1682.515" id=c_"1682.515">__earn__</span> object does, it, it does random choices, but it prevents a repetition until it it uses up all the numbers. Yeah. So basically it allows you to do random. So in this case, if you're selecting your parameters, it means all of the parameters are gonna get selected before you hit any of 'em a second time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b>Yeah. It's like shuffling cards. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's like shuffling cards. Right, exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b>Which is rolling dice. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Which is why I don't understand why it was called Earn, but, you know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b>Well, it's kind of like, if you think about it, I mean, an <span style="color:red" data-ts="1713.325" data-end_ts="1713.605" title="1713.325" id=c_"1713.325">__earn__</span> with names, it's like names in a hat. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, I guess, 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b>Yeah. That's the way I'd think of it anyway. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, I think names in a hat would've been a cooler name for <span style="color:red" data-ts="1721.765" data-end_ts="1721.845" title="1721.765" id=c_"1721.765">__me__</span> anyway. Right. <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b>It's longer, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Longer, more typing. It's 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b>Easier to type urn than names <span style="color:red" data-ts="1728.745" data-end_ts="1728.965" title="1728.745" id=c_"1728.745">__in__</span> hat. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Maybe it was designed by someone who used it a lot <laugh>, so wanted as few letters as possible. But so now I, I have to ask why the TX 81 ZI mean, you're right, it's, it is, almost impenetrable from a, you you're never gonna want program it from the front panel. And even having worked with it in the past and using some, onscreen editors, it was a little bit, hieroglyphic laden. Yeah. What made you choose that? Was it because it was difficult or just 'cause it was cheap? 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b>Well, no, actually because it was easier than the FSS one r <laugh>, which <span style="color:red" data-ts="1770.085" data-end_ts="1770.205" title="1770.085" id=c_"1770.085">__I__</span> also have one of those. Yeah. Yeah. And there's like, what is it, 2000 parameters in the FSS one R, something like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Insane. Well, it's got all those format filters and stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b>Yeah. I mean, it's beautiful. It's an incredible instrument. But the TX 81 Z it only has, it's only a four operator. Well, I mean, there's eight algorithms, but there's only four operators. And so it's a lot more manageable, I think, I think, out of all of the parameters that there, there are the core parameters that I chose to manipulate, there was 73. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Alright. So that's, that's pretty easy to wrap your arms around. Then. 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b>That's the envelopes, that's the envelopes for each operator. It's the waveform for each operator, the level of each operator, unless you disable the levels, which I have a, a checkbox in the patch that will allow you to disable the levels, because if you do enable that as a, as a, parameter that can be modified, then sometimes you end up with like real quiet stuff. So sometimes it's nicer to just leave the levels alone and Sure. Manipulate other stuff. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So now you said that like with, your <span style="color:red" data-ts="1833.665" data-end_ts="1833.885" title="1833.665" id=c_"1833.665">__mug__</span> that you kind of have a, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1835.885" data-end_ts="1836.005" title="1835.885" id=c_"1835.885">__a__</span> starter patch that you use as, as your mechanism. Do you use the, do you use this, this system in life performance? 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b>Yeah, absolutely. So what, so like a handful of different projects. I, I do solo electronic performances too that are just all hardware based. I use like an analog four from Electron. Right. So I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1857.285" data-end_ts="1857.445" title="1857.285" id=c_"1857.285">__use__</span> that with my duet project called ocon. It's me and this guy Graham O'Brien on drums. And that, that project is interesting because I was using <span style="color:red" data-ts="1864.885" data-end_ts="1865.165" title="1864.885" id=c_"1864.885">__this__</span> software that I made in processing called GMS that, stood for just Gestural Music Sequencer. And what I did is I set up, this software that would take the input from the video camera and it would generate MIDI notes based on brightness tracking. And then I'd set up probability distribution. So you could sort of design these scales and, and it would sort of fit within these scales or not, or, and, then I would live loop that into Ableton and then send the, the MIDI signals to like hardware synths and so on and so forth. 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b>And the nice thing about that is then I could kind of project what I was doing with the video camera. I would use like bike lights, and I took apart these, old, spinning tops that had like weird LED patterns in them. Oh yeah. That would help that. I would hold those right up to the camera and I'd see you'd get all this blurry LED stuff going on by holding it right up there. And so, so we'd project that visual, and then I would sort of use that visual to, to generate the, the MIDI that was going out to these different instrument sites. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see. I see. 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b>And then, and then sort of live loop, some of that stuff while Gram would go nuts, some drums we're using, now I'm using more of a traditional sort of sequenced some things sequenced ahead of time in the A four and then, you know, and then playing lines on top of it on the, mugs sub 37 for that project. But the other two projects I play in are more sort of like just playing my instrument. So I use a Rhodes Electric piano for, for the chords, and I run that through like a delay. And then I have like the sub 37, which is also running through a delay at times. And, and it is more like, you know, improvising with, with these other artists. One of one of those projects is called DKO, it's this guy John Davis on bass, and he also switches off to bass clarinet, which is really fun. 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b>And also Grandma o' O'Brien on drums. And then, so the three of us kind of just experiment in that realm. And we've done some things where we've been experimenting with textual scores as well. And actually, that's your fault because <laugh>, I heard your, interview with, Paul Eros, and I was really fascinated by, by her work. And so I looked into it and did some research and, and I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1998.445" data-end_ts="1998.645" title="1998.445" id=c_"1998.445">__wanted__</span> to experiment in that realm. And, so we've done a few things with, with this idea of, of, textual scores. In fact, I, I did, there's you ever heard of Northern Spark? It's a yearly, festival that we have here in Minneapolis. Yes. I've played there. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2015.105" data-end_ts="2015.325" title="2015.105" id=c_"2015.105">__So__</span> it's not the same as the Spark Festival, I think. Oh, I thought they were the same. Yeah, no, the, the Spark Festival. I also played at the Spark Festival, which that was amazing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b>That was like an more of an electronic music and art festival. Right, right. Northern Spark is a really great event put on by Steve Dietz. It goes all night. It's a, it starts at, at in the evening and it finishes in the morning. Oh, okay. And, we, we have like 50,000 people come through this thing, and this project's everywhere, all over the city. Sometimes Minneapolis and St. Paul, sometimes it's just in Minneapolis <span style="color:red" data-ts="2047.185" data-end_ts="2047.405" title="2047.185" id=c_"2047.185">__or__</span> just in St. Paul? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> it's been going on since 2011. And I've been involved in one way or another since, since it started. But, this last year was, you know, June, 2015. I, I worked on a project with my students called Instant Composer. Mad Libbed Music was the subtitle. And we developed a web app that could be accessed via your mobile phone or, you know, you could go to this kiosk with an iPhone on it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b>And, it's a little five step process. You could write one of these scores, these textual scores, and then they would go up on a projector screen with some spectral analysis in the background. It was an ensemble of musicians that would just read these scores and then we would just go for it. Oh my goodness. And play whatever we wanted to based on what people had written. Right. Was really fun. We, we did 69 of these compositions over the, what was the length of the performance? It was incredible. Wow. But, it was just amazing what people came up with too. You know, we, we gave them, you know, and the app had like ways for them to sort of pick things from menus, but if they wanted to, they could just type stuff in. And so people typed in things about geometry or they would type in things about, you know, different modes. One person's mood. So one of the questions was mood one, one person's mood was, the 15 minutes after my divorce was Final <laugh>. So I don't know, I don't know if that's like a good thing or a bad thing necessarily. Could be, could go either way. I suppose 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b>Eding, how to interpret that as an improviser was 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b>It's really, you know, just kind of invigorating. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and I have to admit that of all the cities in the United States, I think that Minneapolis is one of the few where you could do something like that and not, some have somebody just stand there and just type shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit over and over again. Right. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b>Yeah. Well, you know, I, we, we were moderating these, so I had students who were working this little moderation booth. I see. Okay. But there weren't that many that were just all penises <span style="color:red" data-ts="2172.125" data-end_ts="2172.405" title="2172.125" id=c_"2172.125">__around__</span>. Right, right. So people were actually wanted to see their scores up there. And one, you know, there were a few people who were trying to like, promote their, their, Twitter account and, you know, or their, their ad firm or something. But, you know, we, we managed to moderate those out. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What is, what is it about Minneapolis though? Minneapolis St. Paul that seems so open to that kinda stuff. 'cause you mentioned Spark Festival, which always was kind of a, a really cool combo of sort of like dance electronic, but experimental electronic too. They, yeah. Kinda wove those together, but just a lot of other, I mean, I've performed up there in a number of different kind of scenarios and it, there's always, first of all, warm embrace from an audience, which isn't always the case, but also just a real acceptance of, of art for art's sake by the, the city and the community. It seems like a kind of a, a magical place for that reason. And I, why, why Minneapolis? Why are they like that? You know? And it's funny because, you know, when Ali Mont <span style="color:red" data-ts="2241.485" data-end_ts="2241.725" title="2241.485" id=c_"2241.485">__<inaudible>__</span> was up there, you know, he was doing all the projection stuff. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b>Min I, I was involved with him in, in a lot of that. That was really fun. Oh, it's been amazing 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>To participate. Yeah. But, you know, a lot of people, Doug Gears when he was up there, was doing amazing, amazing work as well. It's just a lot of fantastic stuff is, has, has or is going on in Minneapolis. What do you think makes Minneapolis that place? 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b>I agree. I, I don't know, it's hard to put a finger on it, but I think one of the things that, is interesting is that, you know, there are a lot of, there are a lot of, larger area, larger cities where the scenes sort of gel together. And it's sort of like everybody's in this scene and then, you know, someone else is in this scene and they, there's less cross pollination, I think because Minneapolis is so small. One of the things, like if you're a good drummer, if you wanna play jazz, you can go and play jazz, but people are gonna ask you to play blues. They're gonna ask you to play, you know, singer songwriter stuff. They're gonna ask you to play in all these other projects, rock projects. And so if any, you know, these great jazz drummers we have, like JT Bates for example, or Dave King, you know, JT Bates plays in so many different projects and he's amazing in all of them. 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b>And I think what happens is, you know, if we've got these great musicians, but they're also willing to sort of, you know, crosspollinate into these other scenes and play electronic music instead of just jazz music and having electronic music night that they, that they do. And so that's one thing. But I'm not, I'm not sure. I mean, it seems it's, it is a really great place. I love being here. And, I love also other parts of the world. I, I performed at the Echo <span style="color:red" data-ts="2353.165" data-end_ts="2353.445" title="2353.165" id=c_"2353.165">__Fluxx__</span> Festival in Prague, and that was amazing. Just to be part of that festival and, and be in that part of the world. But, yeah, it, it's, you know, the winters are brutal here. <laugh>, but, but, you know, it's, I've I've been sticking it out for quite some time now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. Well, I've got family up there, so next time I come to visit Minneapolis, I'll look you up and we'll go out and have a beer or something 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b>That, that'd be great. I would love that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright, well, as is seems to be typical, I've kind of blown through the time. I really appreciate you, setting aside the time to talk, talk to me. It's been really great. Before we go, a couple of things. First of all, I, I've got this question that I keep on trying to get people to answer because fun stuff sometimes comes out of it, which is, if you ran into the 18 to 21 year old version of yourself, what would you tell that person, to either make the way easier or make it usefully harder or basically tell them to get a law degree? You know, what would, what would you, what would you do? 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b>Yeah. Well, you know, <laugh>, it's funny because you know, a lot of people, you know, in interviews when they're asked something like, oh, what were your, what are your regrets? Oh, I have no regrets. And I just think that's a lot of bullshit. I think everybody 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2443.805" data-end_ts="2443.845" title="2443.805" id=c_"2443.805">__<laugh>__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2443.845" data-end_ts="2443.885" title="2443.845" id=c_"2443.845">__I__</span> think so too. 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b><laugh>, everybody has regrets, right? And so, maybe regrets is the wrong, wrong word, but, you know, everybody wishes they would've done something different. If you look back on anything, if you have the hindsight and you can look back on things, of course you would do things a little differently. I would say one of the things I would do is I, you know, I, I kind of quit college and then went back to college later to, you know, make this career in music. 'cause I was gonna be a rock star and I was gonna be a keyboard player and these, you know, and it was just, you know, kids, me being a kid and being silly, I wish I would've stayed in school, and gotten my, bachelor's degree sooner and gotten my MFA sooner. Although, you know, a lot of that experience was probably really good. 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b>And who knows if I would've, if I would've done that, what, how things would've gone now. But, you know, that and, you know, sticking it, sticking it out with piano lessons a little longer and, you know, focusing more on, you know, learning music a little bit. But, you know, I feel like I'm, I'm pretty confident as a musician, but it's amazing how you can just keep learning. Like, I just started taking piano lessons again after sort of a long hiatus from piano lessons. And I don't think I would've, you know, picked up on the sort of things I'm picking up on now from my teacher, you know? Right. And so it's, it's, it's great. You know, it's like even after all these years I'm learning new stuff about jazz piano theory, scale theory. It's, it's super fun to kind of experience that now. And even though I wish I would've learned it years ago, <laugh>, you know, we're always learning. And I think that's the thing is that life is just a big long learning experience. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Well, I think, I think you actually hit on something though important there too, which is this idea that if you would've done stuff earlier, it might not have led you down the road that you, that you eventually took. And, you know, I always think in terms of like, so I, I studied jazz and I, I was a pretty good guitarist, but I damaged my hands and I couldn't really play really aggressive stuff anymore. It caused me to have to learn a whole bunch of things, but it also got me more involved in art rather than music and being a musician. And it changed my perspectives on things. And now when I learn stuff, it, it's learning. It's, it's sort of like taking these new ingredients and adding them to already a hardy stew. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And I think that that's a, that's a really valuable thing. And I think that then those new influences you get actually have a completely different, you know, I now, when I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2601.885" data-end_ts="2602.165" title="2601.885" id=c_"2601.885">__learned__</span> something like about theory for example, it's, it's very much like I am learning something that's, that's a new addition to this rich stuff I'm doing, rather than saying, okay, I learned something and now if I'm really serious about being a jazz player, you know, I have to, I have to work hard on jazzing this thing, right? And so I think that there's something really valuable to kind of like adding things to a, a mature artist arsenal. 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b>Absolutely. You could always add to your vocabulary. And, and I think sometimes we have a fear of that. Like, you, you hear, you know, some sort of complex word or phrase and you don't know what it means, well that's okay. You don't have to know what it means. Not everybody else does either, but don't be afraid to try to figure out what it means, right. And find out what it means and then, and then apply that to your own vocabulary. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? Absolutely. So John, where can people go to find, more information about you and, your work? 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b>A number of places, there's John, just john caston.com is sort of a, a selected portfolio of things. Audio cookbook.org is where I sort of blurt out all my random experiments and you know, just share everything that's going on. Then I, on SoundCloud I have a soundcloud.com/osaka is O-S-T-R-A-K-A. And that's, you know, some of the icicle stuff. Is there, some of my solo stuff is there, some of the duet and trio stuff is there too. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright. And the icicle release itself, which again, I fell in love with, where would people go to purchase that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>John: </b>So it's icicles spelled I-S-I-K-L-E s.bandcamp.com. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Fantastic. John, I want to thank you so much for spending the time. It's been great to talk, talk with you and great to hear about the directions that you've taken and also kind of intriguing me to check out some new things. I'm always, I always get inspired when I talk to people, so <span style="color:red" data-ts="2725.845" data-end_ts="2725.965" title="2725.845" id=c_"2725.845">__I__</span>, it was great to be, to get that from you.

So <laugh>, I hope, we follow through on that. And so with that, I want to thank you again for your, listenership, for sticking with me through all of these episodes, and I will see you next week. Bye.
