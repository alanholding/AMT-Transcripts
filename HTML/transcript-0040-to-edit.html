<b>Darwin: </b>Welcome back to the podcast. This is podcast number 40, kind of a important milestone. Kind of my guest is Pauline Ros. She is a, a dynamo. She is a force of nature. She currently is the primary person behind something called Deep listening, which is what we focused on in this podcast. Additionally, she teaches at Rensselaer, Institute, and she has a history that is amazing. She is still a very active performer. She recently celebrated her 80th birthday, and I think the amount of, work she puts out puts us all <span style="color:red" data-ts="56.59" data-end_ts="56.79" title="56.59" id=c_"56.59">__the__</span> shame. Nevertheless, I hope you enjoy this. It's, it should be eye-opening and it should be inspiring, and I hope that you'll take the opportunity to, to listen to some of this and then seek out some of the information that sh, that Pauline was willing to share with us. Enjoy. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>All right. This week I am really honored to be introducing y'all to somebody who I respect really greatly. Her name is Pauline Oliveres. She's a teacher at rpi, which is Rensselaer Polytechnic, but she has, she's probably one of the most active people in the media arts that there possibly can be. In addition to this teaching and, instructional work. She is the head of or she is involved. I'm not sure exactly what we relationship, we'll talk about that in a second. With Deep Listening and <span style="color:red" data-ts="114.71" data-end_ts="114.79" title="114.71" id=c_"114.71">__the__</span> Deep Listening Institute, she is an active artist, and, she has got a history that, <span style="color:red" data-ts="123.43" data-end_ts="123.67" title="123.43" id=c_"123.43">__will__</span> just make your teeth hurt. It's so amazing. So we'll just kick off. Hi, Pauline. Thank you very much for spending time with us. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauline Oliveros: </b>Oh, hi Darwin Happy to be here. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Let's start off, in several of our previous, interviews with people, the concept of deep listening and the Deep Listening Institute has come up. Your name is attached to it very tightly. Were you were the originator of the deep, deep listening concept, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauline: </b>Yes, this is true. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>When did you start putting the ideas together? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauline: </b>Well, first of all, I guess we have to go back to the 1970, when I was teaching at the University of California San Diego. And I began to compose, a group of pieces called Sonic Meditations. And these, these pieces were really about, the composing the direction of attention, listening. And they were pieces that were pros, pros, compositions. And so it was so that anyone could, participate if they wanted to without musical training. Right. So these pieces be, I think, are fairly well known these days. But in the, in 1970, it was rather a, an unusual, concept. And I <laugh> <span style="color:red" data-ts="210.24" data-end_ts="210.46" title="210.24" id=c_"210.24">__cuz__</span> I was really turning my back on a lot of things at that, at that time. <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It seems to be sort of a tenet at the time, is that it was important to find something to turn your back on 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauline: </b>Really <laugh>, I guess so <laugh>. But in any case, if we, we jumped in 1988, my longtime, lifetime friend, Stuart Dempster and I, invited me to, to, a cistern in Washington state. And this cistern is, is, now called the Dan Harpel cistern. It was a very interesting thing to go into this cistern and play. When, when there was a reverberation time of 45 seconds, we went into the cistern and as an afterthought, took a recording engineer with us. And, we, the third person that was with along was Ottis, a singer. So we started to, to play and we played for about five hours and, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="274.94" data-end_ts="275.06" title="274.94" id=c_"274.94">__a__</span> recording was made and that recording was released, or, or pieces from that, session were released in 1989 by New Albion, records. It's still, it's still around. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauline: </b>And, it happened to be called Deep Listening. Now Stuart and I share, an interest in puns and, and we are always joking and, to play in that system meant to be 14 feet down underground. Right, right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="309.44" data-end_ts="309.66" title="309.44" id=c_"309.44">__But__</span> we thought, we thought that was pretty deep <laugh>. Yeah. So Deep Listening was, was born in that cistern <laugh>. And, I wrote, in the liner notes about it and saying that, our listening had to be inclusive of not only our own sounds that we were making, but also and of each other, but also of the ciar itself. Which when you deal with 40, 45 second reverberation time with many reflections, floating around the, the circle of the cistern, you've got a lot, a lot to listen to and a lot to deal with. So that was the occasion, or that's how deep listening, as a, as the <span style="color:red" data-ts="359.46" data-end_ts="359.62" title="359.46" id=c_"359.46">__two__</span>, a meme or, or two words came together? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauline: </b>Sure. <span style="color:red" data-ts="362.82" data-end_ts="363.18" title="362.82" id=c_"362.82">__Within__</span> 1988. And then, so we named the album Deep Listening and, then we became, we called ourselves the Deep Listening Band. And of course, that is stuck, and we've been the Deep listening band since then, and celebrated our 25th anniversary playing together. And we, this, this is interesting because on my 80th birthday at, at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute where I teach, there was a birthday concert, with a deep listening band and a, a really wonderful present, which was the simulation of the cistern acoustics that we played in. And this was, this was done by my colleague, Jonas Brush, who is an acoustician. And we took him to the cistern in 2009, and he took an impulse response and then worked on the simulation for about three years with a couple of his graduate students. So for the first time, we realized this, this kind of dream that we had, that we could, we wanted to be able to take the acoustics of the cistern with us 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Right. Yeah. It's not really practical to tour with <span style="color:red" data-ts="438.02" data-end_ts="438.22" title="438.02" id=c_"438.02">__the__</span> cistern, but 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauline: </b><laugh> Well, it's not even practical to do a concert there, <laugh>. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauline: </b>Because the, the opening is just a kind of a manhole opening, and you have to go down 14 feet. And if you took an audience down there, well, they pretty soon <span style="color:red" data-ts="453.78" data-end_ts="454.06" title="453.78" id=c_"453.78">__ruined__</span> the acoustics 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Right, true enough. Good point. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauline: </b>So anyways, it was wonderful because that concert, had an audience of 600 at the Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center Impact, we call it. And, everyone was in the cistern. And it was, it was really an amazing experience for people. And they, they were very happy about it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, to do this, to do this simulation, was it, you said he did an impulse response, and then I imagine, with something with that long of a reverb time, it's not just a simple matter of piping it into a convolution reverb, I assume that there was a lot of, specific tweaking for that sound. Did you also do it in multi-channel, or was it just a stereo? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauline: </b>Oh, no, it was, it was certainly multichannel. I think that, that there was a, an array of at least 36 speakers. We had the small John Meyer speakers, the the newer ones. Right. Arranged around the, concert hall. And then there were speakers under the floor and, of course a couple of subwoofers. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, that must have sounded amazing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauline: </b>It did. It was fantastic. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So when you're working as something in, in that kind of environment, how do you prevent yourself from just stopping, playing and listening? I mean, with the 45 second decay time on a reverb, it strikes me that you probably did have a lot of time to sit back and listen anyway. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauline: </b>Yes, you, you do. But you also are, you know, you're, you're listening is the, is the guide through the whole, whole thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, let's talk a little bit more then about how you took the concepts that you pulled together with this band and started being able to teach it to other people, <span style="color:red" data-ts="572.81" data-end_ts="573.3" title="572.81" id=c_"572.81">__because__</span> that's, that's where I'm, I'm getting a lot of feedback from people is that they've interacted with you or with the institute in some way and have come out of it with their sense of performance. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> having been completely changed. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauline: </b>Yeah. Okay. Well, that's, that's wonderful to news and wonderful to hear. In 1991, I, was invited to a retreat center belonging to a friend of mine, Andy Gold, and, and his sister Eloise Gold. And, I was invited to, to come up there and do whatever I would like for a week. And so I decided I was gonna have a retreat. And because I liked the idea of retreat, and this is <span style="color:red" data-ts="620.08" data-end_ts="620.3" title="620.08" id=c_"620.08">__fi__</span> 8,000 feet up in the Sanger DeCristo Mountains of New Mexico. And so I put an ad in Ear Magazine and I decided to call it the Deep Listening Retreat. And there were 20 people showed up, came up the mountain, they had to come up in the four wheel drive because, there's no other way. We were the only, the only thing happening up there. And it was beautiful, very little impact on the environment is very, natural. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauline: </b>Right. So it was a beautiful place, to do this retreat. So with those 20 people, we, did the initial retreat and, I was feeling my way as to how to do this, but, people seem to come out of it with a very good, in a very good space. There is a little publication from that retreat, it's called, let's see, what is it? Deep Listening <span style="color:red" data-ts="676.64" data-end_ts="676.8" title="676.64" id=c_"676.64">__at__</span> Rose Mountain. <span style="color:red" data-ts="678.2" data-end_ts="678.52" title="678.2" id=c_"678.2">__Cause__</span> everyone composed by the end of the retreat <span style="color:red" data-ts="681.22" data-end_ts="681.44" title="681.22" id=c_"681.22">__and__</span> performed, performed their compositions. And this, this little booklet has all 20 compositions in it. And so that one of the important things is that people be, become very creative in, in the retreat and taking on the, the ways of listening and responding that I have developed and, you know, continually kind of contribute in, in the different pieces that I've written. I have a book, that was just released in 2013. It's called an Anthology of Tech Scores by Pauline Oliveros has over about a hundred pieces in it, but all of these pieces are designed to direct attention to ways of listening and ways of responding. So all of these, all of these things have been accumulating over the 25 years of people listening. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I think it's really interesting that you've published these scores. And if you could see me, you'd see I'm, I'm doing like little quote marks around it, because a lot of times people coming from music background, they think of scores and, and frankly, I saw that book available and I was a little nervous about reaching out to buy it, because what I didn't want was, you know, a great big fold fold out. It's interesting to hear that this is, of course, your textual score is being, being reproduced. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, what is it about a textual score that is important to you? Because clearly, and you said that, that at one point you, you've used the textual score as a way to turn your back on the typical or prototypical, composer kind of activities. Is there more to it than just allowing anyone to be able to use it? Do you find that you interface with it in a different way? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauline: </b>Well, if we go back to Sonic meditations, yes. Those scores, let me, let me give you an example of one of these scores, from Sonic Meditations. This one is called Native, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="812.66" data-end_ts="812.78" title="812.66" id=c_"812.66">__it__</span>, and it's, it is about one sentence long. It says, take a walk at night and walk so softly that the bottoms of your feet become ears. Now that's the score. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I can see what you mean about it being, it directing your attention, because just even as you were saying that, I could feel my attention move to the bottom of my feet. Yeah. That's something that's a pretty amazing kind of thing, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauline: </b><laugh> Yes, it is. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Given that I'm like trying to focus on doing a podcast, all of a sudden I'm wondering like, whoa. Feel the bottom of my feet. Right. <laugh>. So that's, that's, it's actually very effective. Now, there's, there have been other people that have, have focused on doing textual scores as, as well. What makes yours different? Is it, is it really this focus <span style="color:red" data-ts="864.94" data-end_ts="865.16" title="864.94" id=c_"864.94">__of__</span> verbiage or, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauline: </b>Well, I think of, I think of these text scores as algorithms. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, nice. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauline: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="873.11" data-end_ts="873.4" title="873.11" id=c_"873.11">__Yeah__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's, that's a great way to think of it. I, I have to admit, I wouldn't have thought come up with that phrase, but that's awesome. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauline: </b>So this, what, what happens, you know, with a, a simple set of rules is something can be very complex. I, what I teach in deep listening is two forms of, of listening. One is what I call inclusive listening. And this is, expanding, so that you have a kind of global sense of, everything that's sounding, inside of your own mind as well as outside and as far as possible. And so that one, so the listening meditation could be, focused on, on that kind of listening so that you can continually expand to receive everything that, that there is. And that kind of listening you have to suspend your, your critical judgment. So we call it lifting off judgment, and also to suspend an analytical thought criticism analysis, all let go of that so that you can actually receive what's going on. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauline: </b>And, this is something that is difficult for some people because, they've trained themselves to tune out and to, to not hear what's going on. And so that's, this is what I call inclusive listening. And then, then the other form is, of course, is exclusive listening, where you focus all your attention to a point to follow a, sequence or, or to gain all the information you can from a single sound. So these two forms of listening are what I teach and what we practice in, in a retreat or a workshop or a session or a class, whatever, it's important to be able to, to to know what you're doing in, in how you're listening so that, you're not being unconscious about your listening. So these pieces, all of these pieces have, have these ways of listening and, kind of teach you how to do that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. That's, that sounds really interesting. Now, I'm curious about something you've been teaching, students for 20 plus years now, since 1991. Have you seen changes in people because of changes in the environment? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauline: </b>Oh, yeah, I think so. <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What are, what are some of the things that you think you've seen? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauline: </b>Well, I, I think that, focal listening or exclusive attention has, has increased pretty dramatically. And right now, for example, everywhere you go in the world, you see somebody with a, with a smartphone. Right, right. And with their attention is, is quite glued to the smartphone. That's what I call focus. Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Yes, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauline: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's, that's one thing of calling it <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauline: </b>Right. You might call it a lot of other things. Right. And in my class, you're absent if you have that going on. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I tend to call it rude, but 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauline: </b>Well, it's, it's a, it's something that, I mean, people are really just addicted to it. Right? Absolutely. And I mean, you just see everyone, all kinds of people everywhere in the world, this is, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1103.2" data-end_ts="1103.42" title="1103.2" id=c_"1103.2">__is__</span>, is happening. So this is a big change 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Since that kind of, exclusive listening is becoming or exclusive attention. Yeah. As that becomes more a focus of people's lives, do you find that students simultaneously than have more trouble with the inclusive listening process, the expansive listening to, to the world around? <span style="color:red" data-ts="1129.46" data-end_ts="1129.82" title="1129.46" id=c_"1129.46">__Because__</span> I, I mean, I'm curious because you have hands-on experience with this, and I'm curious to, to know if this almost laser focus, whether it's on your cell phone or your laptop, or your latte, whatever it is, <laugh>, if, if that also doesn't change your ability to accept and engage the outside world. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauline: </b>Well, I think it might, in my, my classes, people change, quite a bit. I've, I've seen a lot of community develop through the, through this work that I do, for example. Now, a couple of things I wanna tell you, one is that Deep Listening Institute is currently dissolving it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1178.34" data-end_ts="1178.82" title="1178.34" id=c_"1178.34">__nonprofit__</span> status, and it has become the center for deep listening at Rensselaer. And, so that the long legacy that we have, we have is now becoming part of the, part of Rensselaer Polytechnic. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauline: </b>For the past two years now, we've done, an international conference, which is called Deep Listening Art Science, and, the keynotes one keynote is on the Art of Listening, and the other keynote is on the Science of listening. And I'm trying to, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1214.47" data-end_ts="1214.69" title="1214.47" id=c_"1214.47">__en__</span> interest, neuroscientists and cognitive scientists to, study listening, because listening is not the same as hearing. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1225.79" data-end_ts="1226.01" title="1225.79" id=c_"1225.79">__And__</span> we, we kind of use these words interchangeably, but they're not, I mean, hearing we know quite a bit about, because you can measure a lot about it, and scientists love to measure things, but listening is, is, is a different matter because the ear does its job of gathering sound waves and, transducing them to electricity, to send to the audio cortex. And there is where listening starts to take place. But we need to know more about that, I think. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, I agree. One of the things I, I teach at the University of Denver, I teach, Sonic Arts is one of the classes, and one of the things that we do a lot in the class is talk about how the brain interacts with the ear in order to generate emotion. It's sort of a different thing than what you teach. And I'm curious to know what your reaction is to some of this. So one of the things that we spend a lot of time talking about is how hearing is one of the sort of like danger sensing mechanisms in the brain. Right. And it's actually a fairly early one, because I'll, oftentimes when it's dark or you're in a deep woods, your ears are going to be able to detect danger before your eyes will. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauline: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And so our brains tend to be really tightly attuned to, certain kinds of noises that will, will make you tense and make you prepare for action. Right. You know, that's an area where when I go and I try and dig through at least the kind of science information that I can comprehend, I do teach in an art school after all, <laugh>. Right. But, when I, dig through the, the kind of neuroscience that I can comprehend, I don't see a lot of discussion about, about that. And I think you, you hit on something which is, it's not particularly measurable. Right. Hence, it's difficult for scientists to wrap their heads around. What are some of the science of listening that you think are particularly under appreciated or understudied? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauline: </b>Yes. Well, first of all, just listening <laugh> that I think is, it doesn't have as much attention, as hearing. And, we, you know, in music schools, we're, we're, we're teaching what's called ear training when I'm, I'm saying, you know, I don't think the ear can be trained. It's the brain that can be 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Trained. Yeah. It's brain training. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauline: </b>And so I, you know, I may <laugh> I shock people by saying that, but I think it's true. Then I wanted to dig further into neuroscience and cognitive science and try to begin to, to get some, other information if possible. Now, the first, neuroscientist that we had, last year at the conference was Seth Horowitz. He was an auditory neuroscientist, and he wrote a book called The Universal Sense, how Hearing Shapes the Mind. And so I invited him to give this talk, on the science of listening. And I challenged him, I said, you know, I, I just gave him the same pitch that I gave you, which is <laugh>. I wonder why you aren't talking about listening. Right. <laugh>, his book is very interesting and very good. There's a lot of, lot of good material in it. And, he took the challenge and he started, he said he started another book. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, that's fascinating. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauline: </b>Yeah. And, this, this time we had Peter Ani and Peter is an, auditory neuroscientist at, at <span style="color:red" data-ts="1450.7" data-end_ts="1450.94" title="1450.7" id=c_"1450.7">__Harvard__</span>, and he has done quite a lot of work on music. And, he, he came to the whole conference and took in everything, and he gave a really, amazing, talk. And he talked about, I don't know, auditory loops in the brain, which, how, how, how, how these loops feedback in terms of listening. And that was the first time I had heard something really, really fascinating. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. I think, I think that there's an incredible amount of information that has yet to be tracked down. I mean, I find different capabilities in different people, but <span style="color:red" data-ts="1490.88" data-end_ts="1491.1" title="1490.88" id=c_"1490.88">__one__</span> of the things that amazes me is how quickly people can identify patterns right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1496.32" data-end_ts="1496.54" title="1496.32" id=c_"1496.32">__In__</span> sound. Yes. When they're, when they're put, even if they're not necessarily put into the position of supposedly listening to it, but they will find loops. They will find patterns really quickly, almost as if the brain is spending a lot of time just trying to figure out what might be ignorable because of looping. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauline: </b>Yeah. Yeah. Well, I think this is what he, that he was really working on that, and he, he gave a very long talk. I think we've got the, well, we have the documentation of it, and, we'll get to that as soon as we can. And he's sending me the, his slides also, but he, he is very interested and, I, I have a feeling we'll be talking quite a bit as time goes on. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I have to say that I did not open this, this discussion by introducing your age, although you revealed <span style="color:red" data-ts="1549.09" data-end_ts="1549.38" title="1549.09" id=c_"1549.09">__that__</span>, speaking of your, recent 80th birthday. Yeah. It sounds to me like you're just hitting your stride, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauline: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I mean, does it feel that way to you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauline: </b>Well, I'm feeling, feeling I can feel, you know, that I've been around for a while, but I still am, am playing <span style="color:red" data-ts="1569.24" data-end_ts="1569.46" title="1569.24" id=c_"1569.24">__and__</span> performing and, and doing my teaching and so on. So I, my mind is not stopping. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, you are, you are so busy right now, it seems. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauline: </b>Oh, I had a wonderful concert in, in Prague just this past week with George Lewis and, and Joelle <span style="color:red" data-ts="1586.17" data-end_ts="1586.66" title="1586.17" id=c_"1586.17">__Leondre__</span>. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Nice. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauline: </b>It was quite a trio, let me tell you. <laugh>. Oh, bet. It's, so, I felt, you know, really fantastic with that performance. And, I, I am doing quite a lot, that's for sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, at this point, you, you said that the Deep Listening Institute is being, put to rest, and the Center for Deep Listening is going to kind of take, take the mantle. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauline: </b>Yes. Well, Rensselaer is, is, well, the steward of Deep Listening Institute, so Sure. And so the, that the work we've done, I feel confident can be carried on, and the conference will be annual. We also added a one day festival to the conference, and hopefully that will grow, so <span style="color:red" data-ts="1635.9" data-end_ts="1636.06" title="1635.9" id=c_"1635.9">__that__</span> we'll have a really nice summer program at Ren <span style="color:red" data-ts="1638.57" data-end_ts="1638.86" title="1638.57" id=c_"1638.57">__live__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So that sounds actually really amazing. Now, the one thing I'm, I'm curious about is what other materials might be available? You know, perhaps for people who want to do some self-study or Oh yeah. Are unable to travel, what kind of things do you have available so that people could, at least start engaging with this process on their own? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauline: </b>Well, you can go to the website deep <span style="color:red" data-ts="1661.58" data-end_ts="1662.46" title="1661.58" id=c_"1661.58">__listening.org__</span> and go to certificate training. And we have, we have a training program, and we're now, we now have a kind of a do-it-yourself training, program, which has <span style="color:red" data-ts="1675.94" data-end_ts="1676.06" title="1675.94" id=c_"1675.94">__a__</span> help from certificate holders, monitoring people who want, who wanna study deep listening. And the, the main idea is for a person to create a, a deep listening study group, meaning that they gather a group, a circle of friends or people or whatever, a class, anything. And there's a lot of material available now, cuz we have my book, which is a deep listening composer sound practice, which describes the class and gives the exercises or some of the things that we do in the class. Then there's Deeply Listening Body by Eloise Gold, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1716.33" data-end_ts="1716.82" title="1716.33" id=c_"1716.33">__because__</span> she's been one of the principal teachers, along with me. And then, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1722.6" data-end_ts="1722.82" title="1722.6" id=c_"1722.6">__ion__</span>, who is, has a wonderful book called Listening in Dreams. And, she's, helping people to listen for, for sound and dreams. And this becomes so that you are studying listening 24 7, so to speak, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That's really a, an interesting point because I know for myself, if I just think about how my day goes so often, I'm either surrounded by, or I'm introducing trash noise into my life mm-hmm. In a way that has no thoughtfulness, has no artistic purpose, and no, no availability for personal growth. Right. <laugh>, I know basically <span style="color:red" data-ts="1766.52" data-end_ts="1766.74" title="1766.52" id=c_"1766.52">__it__</span>, it's the oral equivalent of junk food, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauline: </b>Uhhuh, <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You know, I hate to, I hate to say it that way, and I hate to have to confess that, but that is the truth. And so what I would ask is give me a suggestion to make things a little bit better. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauline: </b>Huh? <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Like a little bit better this afternoon. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauline: </b>Oh, this afternoon, <laugh>. Oh, I see. <laugh>. Okay. Well, let's see what I can do. Well, I, I would say this, that if you can take a, a 32nd break and simply expand your listening as far as possible, that that 30 seconds will be worth an hour. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>One of the things that I'm curious about because, and, and it just came up in that statement you just gave, is to what extent you, you might get frustrated by the ambiguity of words, or if perhaps, especially since you do textual scores for your compositions, do you embrace the vagueness of language or do you find it frustrating or both? So like you just said, listen far. And I'm like, okay, do I try, you know, this is, here, here comes the judgmental brain. Right. You know, rushing into play. Is she talking about distance, how far I can listen? Is she talking about how deep into my brain I can listen <laugh>, you know, <laugh>. And so the, the, the kind of ambiguity of the word opened the door for Mr. Judgment to come rushing in mm-hmm. <affirmative> and, you know, apply the big boot. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauline: </b>Yeah, that's right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1872.61" data-end_ts="1872.83" title="1872.61" id=c_"1872.61">__And__</span> do you, so when you're, when you're working with, with making like textual scores, how often do you utilize ambiguity in order to allow people to have artistic license? <span style="color:red" data-ts="1885.06" data-end_ts="1885.55" title="1885.06" id=c_"1885.06">__Because__</span> I, and I think people have to understand that just because these scores are in text doesn't mean that you just sort of like, you know, take a drag off a cigarette and then dash off seven quick compositions and then have another drag off of a cigarette. Right. <laugh> that there's thoughtfulness involved in this, there's the editing process, there's going back and, and refining things that you've done. How often do you find that the refinement has to be to disambiguate the, the language that you use? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauline: </b>Well, first of all, I like to play with ambiguity. You know, I mean, and there's ambiguous con consciousness, I would say. So yes, sometimes, a play with words is, and the ambiguity is, is intentional, but I also wanna be very clear or as clear as I can be with the fact that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1949.33" data-end_ts="1949.55" title="1949.33" id=c_"1949.33">__the__</span> judgment does rush in so often before the text is truly understood. Right. Or their assumptions are made, assumptions from previous patterns, patterning, you know, that people have. And so how to get to, a very innocent place where the words can convey a, a form of action. It's a take, you know, it takes, it takes some doing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>This is a really wonderful conversation to be having. And particularly because, so the name of this podcast is Art Plus Music Plus Technology. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1995.13" data-end_ts="1995.35" title="1995.13" id=c_"1995.13">__Mm__</span>. And so often the rush is to look at the technology because it's difficult to say, Hmm, you know, I can be artful or I can be musical, but if you have a checkbook, you can be technological <laugh>, you know, technological. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauline: </b>Right. For sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And, and so I think maybe the easiest thing to talk about is like improving your life through the purchase of technology uhhuh. And, the reason that I was really excited to do this is because I feel like that's a trap. I feel like it's a trap because what it does is it focuses on the, the, the new, it focuses on the serotonin rush of shopping 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, but it doesn't necessarily provide people or provide the opportunity for growth in one's musical voice or one's artistic voice. Mm. And I think that what you're doing with this deep listening work is actually that, now one of the things I would ask is to talk about the breadth of the people that have studied this, because I think I, what I, I wouldn't want is for people to dismiss it as being for n you know, x kind of art. Well, only experimentalists will get anything out of this. Hmm. And, I would, you know, just from the people I've talked to, it seems like you have a very broad group of people that engage in this program. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauline: </b>It's true. There's lots of different kinds of people from many different places in the world. You know, I have no judgment on the, on who wants to participate. It's whoever wants to participate, well come along. And that makes, for a very interesting mix. You know, when we had the retreats, people came all the travel far and wide to come up to the mountain. Right, right. 8,000 feet up <laugh>. And, and once you were up there, you were up there and there was no place to go. There was no place to shop. You just had to be there and, and listen together. And it, it still is a, is, a place that people think about and, and, and like a lot. And I'm sure that if we decided to have a retreat at Rose Mountain once more, people would sign up like crazy. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I should have you come do a retreat at my house. I live at 10,000 feet. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauline: </b>Oh, that's nice. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. It's, it's pretty amazing. It's not that I'm not that far out of Denver, but it is, I, we actually moved here because things like city noise were becoming very stressful for me. And so, going <span style="color:red" data-ts="2177.02" data-end_ts="2177.18" title="2177.02" id=c_"2177.02">__at__</span> 10,000 feet, you don't hear very much. That's for certain except the wind. Well, I want to, thank you. I think that you are onto something that's really important. I think it's really important for people, for artists of all sorts, to start considering this kind of self-work as an important part of their life's work as an artist. And so the, the way that you are pulling this together and pulling a community together, I think is pretty amazing. When is the next, conference going to be? Or you just finished one, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauline: </b>Yeah, we just finished it in, it was just this July. Okay. 10 to 13 next, summer. It may be a little later in probably, in August, early August or something. Okay. But it'll be approximately in that time period, I'm, I'm hoping that Rensselaer will get a date for the conference and get the word out right away, because I think a year ahead of time is very, you know, very good because people need to plan. Right. And our, our community is thousands of people these days. And, which is wonderful because both conferences, had at least a hundred registrations, which is pretty amazing, you know, to start with. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. That's, that's a great start. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauline: </b>And, a lot of people came who are people that I recognize from different times and workshops, different associations, all sorts of things. But there's, there's many more who would like to come, but <span style="color:red" data-ts="2281.08" data-end_ts="2281.3" title="2281.08" id=c_"2281.08">__ha__</span> you know, for one reason or another, couldn't, couldn't make it. So I think that we have a good chance of continuing to build community through the conferences, because now, you know, we have, a certificate program, which, meant that the training for a certificate accomplished means that you're qualified to teach a deep listening workshop. And, so we now have 43 certificate holders, plus six more on the way by September, I think. And then another group starting so that the, these certificate holders are, are, you know, multiplying <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. And, and you said they're able to teach, so if you find someone in your area, you can actually work with them on, you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauline: </b>Can work training, can work with, but you can also work online. So that's, and we're gonna be developing that online program quite a bit more. And it's, it's much easier for people to work, you know, with Skype and so forth, of course, yourself with, with your internet problems up there. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It might not be so awesome. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauline: </b>Well, you still can do it because, you know, the telephone conference call works as well. Sure. And, you know, I've been teaching for many years using, all of this kind of technology. I have a, a course that I teach, teach fall at Mills College. And, I teaching it now with Skype, but I have, taught it in many different ways. And one time I even taught it with texting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh my goodness. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauline: </b>Not the whole class, but I mean, not the whole time, but just, there was a class that turned out that the only way to to get through was with texting. And it actually was really interesting because the, students responded much more in certain ways than they had if it was just vocal. So I found that very interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I want to thank you for taking the time to, to talk to me. I apologize if I, was kind of a little scrambled brained, but frankly, you, you present such a lot of information. It's kind of, not even easy to, for me to wrap my arms around it, in real time. And then there's a ton of other stuff I wish we could talk about. I, I would love to talk more about, your adapt adaptive use project. I know, my friend Andrew PAs has been involved in helping you out with that a little bit. And, and just to talk more about your performing process and your, your practice as an artist. And so maybe we'll schedule for another talk, sometime in the near future. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauline: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2446.4" data-end_ts="2446.62" title="2446.4" id=c_"2446.4">__All__</span> right. Thank you very much, Darwin I enjoyed talking with you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>All right, thank you. And, I will talk to you soon. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Pauline: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. I want to really thank, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2459.72" data-end_ts="2459.94" title="2459.72" id=c_"2459.72">__Ms__</span>. Oliveros again for, putting up with my yammering. It was an incredible opportunity for me, one of the highlights of my podcasting for <span style="color:red" data-ts="2471.42" data-end_ts="2471.7" title="2471.42" id=c_"2471.42">__Sharon__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2471.7" data-end_ts="2471.86" title="2471.7" id=c_"2471.7">__and__</span> definitely a good candidate for, podcast number 40. I'd like to reiterate a couple of things that Pauly mentioned herself. One is, if you want to look into the concepts behind Deep Listening a little bit more deeply, a book to check out is one called Deep Listening, A Composer Sound Practice by Pauline Oliveras. It's available, at your local bookstore or from online vendors. I also notice that it is available as a Kindle edition as well. So if you need to have it right this moment, you can get it that way. Additionally, there is the anthology of Tech Scores, also available through retailers. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And, you heard one example in the podcast, but, you can imagine how inspiring it would be to just interact with, a number of those. I I think that it would help any composer or any, in a composer of any sort of media to be able to look at, tech scores like this as, another alternative way of approaching communicating your ideas and communicating even to yourself how to expand and expand upon the, your work and, expand upon the things that are inside your head. So, I hope that you'll take the opportunity to dig a little bit more into this. You can also go to, deep listening.org. As Pauly mentioned. There's a lot of information there as well, but I hope that you do take the opportunity to check into it. I, a number of people who I really respect have really been influenced greatly by the, deep listening movement. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And so I think it's worth all of our time to look into these kinds of things a little bit more. Other than that, I just really want to thank you again for listening, 40 podcasts. That's pretty wild. I have now wasted an entire work week of your time, 40 hours of your time, with these interviews. I don't wanna say wasting because I actually think it's pretty informative, not only for you, but for me as well. We've had an amazing array of people, come through, the podcasts, and I want to thank all of them as well as all of the people that have supported this along the way. And particularly all of you that are listening to this, listenership is fantastic. I'm really, I'm really pleased and, honored that you take the time to listen to it. So with that, I'm gonna sign off, sign off for this week. Join me next week as we'll, jump into Podcast 41. Thanks. Bye.
