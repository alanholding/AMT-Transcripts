    <h3>Released: August 15, 2021</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Okay. Today, I have the opportunity <span style="color:red" data-ts="2.1" data-end_ts="2.52" title="2.1" id=c_"2.1">__of__</span> to talk to somebody who I actually have been wanting to talk to for quite a while his name's Will Kuhn And he
        is somebody that anyone, anyone in the Ableton live circles will recognize him. He's gotten a fair amount of notoriety for his work as an educator, using Ableton live to teach in, in high schools. But, he has a lot more on his, on his plate
        and on his resume than that. And so we're going to get into that a little bit. So with no further ado, let's say hi to will. Hey, will, how's it going? Good. Thanks a lot for taking the time to, to chat with me. I look at kind of what your
        gig is, and I'm surprised that you have any time, any free time at all. You seem to, you seem to keep, keep a pretty full plate. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Will Kuhn: </b>
      Yeah, I guess I do like to stay busy and, you know, the nature of teaching in a public high school and keeping a full program healthy and running in, I, I guess kind of a lifestyle choice in some ways, but, yeah, I don't think I'm burnt out
      yet.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Well, you don't seem to be, because in addition to doing your teaching and keeping that program going use, you just released a book in combination with Ethan Hein and, all about kind of the process and, and the mechanism of pulling, pulling
        a program together. Can you kind of give the elevator pitch of what you've got with that book? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Will: </b>
      Yeah. So I guess the elevator pitch is there wasn't really a good resource on how to set up a high school music tech program. So we made one, there's plenty of resources on how to manage band programs and how to manage orchestra programs and
      how to teach elementary, with various methods. And so this was our attempt at making an all-in-one philosophy, theory and practice of teaching music tech in a high school. So it, it takes you through everything. You need a philosophy wise,
      practically lesson plans. It's got a full semester of lesson plans in it. So, and also how to design those lessons,
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Right? Yeah. I was actually pretty blown away by what I saw there because I expected to see ideas for lesson plans and stuff like that. What I didn't expect was kind of sexually the book that we're dedicated to here are the ways that you
        sell a program to the school. And here's a way that you kind of integrate classroom and after school as kind of a, a connected system. I mean, you, you did a lot things that are really clearly based off of your experiences, your experiences
        teaching. And I think we get a chance to benefit from both the successes and the failures that you've had over that time. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Will: </b>
      <span style="color:red" data-ts="191.88" data-end_ts="192" title="191.88" id=c_"191.88">__Yeah__</span>. The FA failure is the best teacher. That's what Yoda said. But, in a way, you know, the, the earliest versions of this book, I, it was
      shortly after we came out with interactive composition and that are, you know, asked me to come up with some ideas, for something that's more focused towards teachers. And so I thought this was kind of the chance to write the manifesto because
      I had come up with this program that seemed to be sustainable, seemed to be pretty stable. It had a lot of the trappings of a band or choir program in a high school. So it had like a nice vertical track where kids could just kind of be
      exclusive to that program if they wanted to, or you could just kind of touch and go and take the beginner class and get a good experience that way we have, you know, performing groups and some TV studio and recording studio and stuff.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Will: </b>
      So we had all this stock and I was like, okay, it's time to get this all down so that other people can do this, because that was my problem. When I started, it was there weren't that many other programs out there, certainly not in the local
      area of Cincinnati. So, you know, I looked to some people who were already in the game early, people like Barbara Freedman and people like Richard McCready that are like out there already kind of involved in, you know, doing conference
      presentations and stuff. And, so yeah, I, yeah, I came up with this, you know, the rough outline of the book, along with the lesson plans I was teaching and the philosophy things I wanted to get across, as far as there's some philosophical
      underpinnings to why I teach the way I do and things that like an average high school music teacher might need to recalibrate to teach beginners again, because a lot of high school music teachers are, are used to teaching like an already
      narrowed down pool of players.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Will: </b>
      And so <span style="color:red" data-ts="321.12" data-end_ts="321.42" title="321.12" id=c_"321.12">__there__</span>, they kind of need to recalibrate expectations for this group and also like how formal that group is expecting the training to
      be, which is quite a bit less formal than they're used to usually. And that's when Ethan came on, was I, you know, I realized I needed some of that research oomph to, get those points across. And, he just, he's a fabulous researcher and a
      really good writer too. So he was able to take some of these things that I intuitively figured out in practice. And, it's able to tie them to actual research and, you know, make something that's useful, maybe for college music, ed, professors,
      as well as like new music teachers too.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>When you talk about research, you're talking about like educational techniques and educational, concepts and tying that in with the work that you're doing. Right. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Will: </b>
      Okay. Here's a good example of something that just was not formal enough in my own experience to come across to the average, like serious music teacher that needs some backing to what they're reading about a principle that I've applied in
      classes. And we refer to this in the book too. It just comes from star Trek. It's a prime directive. Yeah. I was
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Going to go there because I just, that really cracked me up when I saw that in the book. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Will: </b>
      Yeah. And, and to me, it's, it actually, it comes a little bit from, <span style="color:red" data-ts="416.86" data-end_ts="417.07" title="416.86" id=c_"416.86">__there__</span>, there's a lot of parallels we draw between the way that we teach
      music tech and like art classes. And that was kind of a thing I remember from art class, it being kind of a big deal to change somebody's work or to finish it for them or something like that became like a problematic thing to do. And I felt
      like that's a thing that it's for music teachers that doesn't really come across. Cause we're so used to just playing somebody else's music. We're used to like respecting some score that's handed to us, but not necessarily our own creative
      stuff. So that's the thought process for me when I'm teaching was like, if I need to like fix a student's projects or get them back on track, I'm going to do it with as little interference as possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Will: </b>
      And I'm going to use, stuff that's already in their project as much as possible without creating a new new material for it. And that goes into like all that basic thought has influenced a lot of what I do from, you know, like what songs the EMG
      group is going to pick to play to, you know, just how I run a meeting with students to like everything, you know? So it seemed to be a good principal, but I can't just say like, you know, this is based on star Trek. So like, luckily like Ethan
      is able to see something like that and say like, oh yeah, this reminds me of actual research that I've read and put that into some, you know, tie that into some footnotes that might be useful to actual, people that read and a lot of books. And,
      and yeah, the philosophy of going back to teaching beginners at the high school level is really, it's not just like teaching beginners, but also like teaching the creative process to students, which I feel that's kind of not addressed in a lot
      of music ed programs at the very most you're taught how to arrange songs, but not necessarily how to write songs and you know, how a song is put together and things like that.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Will: </b>
      So, you know, people trying to teach a project-based music class, you know, they end up figuring these things out in the wild and figuring them out on their own. So that's, that was kind of the attempt in this guide was, let's share some
      experience and how to create projects that lead students through this like golden path of experiences that gets them to independence, you know, as fast as you can with as little complication as possible. Right. Yeah.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>That makes a lot of sense. Now you actually were involved in a prior book, which you mentioned there for a second, which is, what was it, interactive composition? Is that the name of <span style="color:red" data-ts="591.83"
          data-end_ts="591.95" title="591.83" id=c_"591.83">__it__</span>? Interactive opposites. Yeah. You did that with Fiji man. So, and that was kind of along the lines of sort of like a recipe book and maybe some, some kind of a teaching project
        concept too, right. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Will: </b>
      Guiding document during that book was those, those O'Reilly series, computer programming books where it's just like, now we're going to make this here's a hundred steps. That was, you know, that, that book from the outset, which is like a
      technical book and we even included stuff like assumptions about the reader and stuff, like, you know, just things that on the computer, like a C plus plus book would have or something. Yeah.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>You know, it really spoke to a lot of people. I know. And, and because there seemed to be a lot of people coming to electronic music that have kind of a technical background. And so it seems like you're able to really kind of like marry
        those, those things together and <span style="color:red" data-ts="647.12" data-end_ts="647.15" title="647.12" id=c_"647.12">__a__</span> pretty useful </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Will: </b>
      Yeah. And well, and in a way that book does genre based projects in that book were like, based off of the prep work that I would do for my music tech two class. So, not necessarily things I would do with my own students, but, things I would do
      before leading them through the easy part of that project. You know, so like building the entire max patch we're going to use, I don't do that with them necessarily, but, but yeah. And so like, I guess that's a big thrust in this book is like
      just teaching music teachers, how to design projects and that have a predictable outcome for the lowest end of students, the real basic kids that just want an experience. I think of, you know, with them, <span style="color:red" data-ts="694.64"
        data-end_ts="694.79" title="694.64" id=c_"694.64">__I'm__</span>, I'm picturing somebody, buying a, like a whale watching tour. They just want to see the whale.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Will: </b>
      They don't need to know a lot about Marine biology or how the boat works or how the boat, where yeah. They just want to see the whale and versus kids who are advanced and want to know how to do everything projects that can meet both of those
      needs at the same time in about the same timeframe. That's the magic trick that the successful music, teachers, music, tech teachers out there figure that out, for their school populations. And so this, this book tries to like break down how
      that is into. So instead of taking you through just like a series of random projects, it takes you through three categories of projects and what you get by teaching that category. So like there's a section on audio projects, the section on mini
      projects. And there's a section on, I think we just call them like out of the box projects that are, you know, try to teach creativity in some way, and we don't necessarily teach any of that in that order, but you need some of those categories
      into your own sequence to get kids where they would want to be at the end of a semester or a year.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>So you are really adept at kind of marrying all these things together. One of the things I like to do on my podcast is talk to people about how they got to be the, the artist educator, Meeker that they, that they are. And, I am really
        curious in your case, you clearly have both a love and a lot of experience in, in education, but clearly, you know, especially you go through the book and kind of the level of detail at which, you know, Ableton live, you know, really points
        to the fact that you're into this thing too. And I'm just wondering, what is it coming up where you, a band kid that, that got into electronic music where you, a teacher that got into music and then electronic, how, how did you get to where
        you're at and particularly how did you come to embrace electronic music and specific? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Will: </b>
      Yeah, I mean, it's funny to piece it together. I grew up taking drum lessons and I was in band and I became a music ed major. And did all the stuff that you would do, you know, recitals and marching band and things like that. I was into
      electronic music almost the whole time though. Like I looked back sometimes like, had some of the CDs and things that my dad had laying around the house, that now I realize were pretty unusual to have like a bunch of art of noise records or a
      bunch of like to meta recordings and stuff like, so I was exposed to some of that stuff and I got into like electronic dance music in high school, mainly because, there was some video games that had a soundtrack that I liked and, and, you know,
      a couple of friends introduced me to delegate effects, twin music and stuff like that.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Will: </b>
      So, and that kind of appealed to the drummer in me, just with all of the really complicated percussion stuff that you could do. But then, you know, that was just in the background. I, I admired the teachers I had who could arrange music. So I
      got into trying to do that and, you know, downloading and stuff like finale and trying to like make scores for us to play and stuff. And that was kind of my thought during college was, I'm going to be a band director, but I'm also going to have
      a side hustle writing people's marching band shows or something. So I did a little bit of that during college and like right afterwards, I mean, it just about burnt me out. I couldn't do that for pay and the pressure that you have with the
      timelines and stuff. I wrote exactly one marching band show and I was very proud of it.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Will: </b>
      And then I just, I had nothing else in me after that. But, so I was like in, you know, it's like the things kind of, a couple of years into me being a junior high band director, does the opportunity arose to start a new class that needed to be
      in an empty computer lab and we needed more electives. And it was like serendipity that, you know, the, our department chair at the time just said, oh, what about a music technology class? That was all the planning that went into it. And, and,
      and so I, I, you know, applied to transfer to that and, nobody had any expectations for it. I think, you know, at the time I was pretty young and naive teacher and people probably thought either this will succeed or it'll fail spectacularly,
      and it'll be easy to get rid of this guy or whatever, you know, but, but Hey, it worked out.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Will: </b>
      And so like when I, when I started that class, I realized the clientele was very different. Like most of the students, the first year were seniors that still needed like an arts credit to graduate. I was like kids that waited four years to
      figure out their basic requirements. So it's like decently low end students in those first couple of semesters. And we've just had a lab of old, you know, bubble shaped IMAX and, you know, the first version of garage band. And we're just like
      learning it together and making whatever we could make. So I would be, you know, a few days ahead of the kids just like, oh, let's see, how would you do a remix in this? How would you do like a, a drum machine? How would you do? Just like, and
      that's when I started to kind of draw on what I knew from electronic music is like, okay, can we sample a break?
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Will: </b>
      <span style="color:red" data-ts="1062.43" data-end_ts="1062.91" title="1062.43" id=c_"1062.43">__Breakbeat__</span> can we do like a since sequence? Can we, you know, I'm just like trying to figure out like how we can make something that's real
      simplified. That is also satisfying. That is not just the pre-packaged loops, because those are fun for a little while, but they get old fast, when you start recognizing them. So it's like, yeah. So, you know, and I showed that, that was like
      early success was just showing a couple of those old project. I think we had one where it's like garage band didn't have like a drum machine that you could sample on <span style="color:red" data-ts="1096.86" data-end_ts="1097.1" title="1096.86"
        id=c_"1096.86">__to__</span>. So we just like recorded like coughs and fist pounding on the table and stuff, and just like cut them. So they would be on the beat grid. And just, I think I showed that project to our curriculum director and she
      was, she was like, well, how much one <span style="color:red" data-ts="1111.41" data-end_ts="1111.47" title="1111.41" id=c_"1111.41">__or__</span> you want, and then she was like, very happy with that.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Will: </b>
      And I think that was the first time that particular person had ever given the music department any money. Cause I mean, they were just looking for new ideas and this was a new idea. So, so yeah, I mean it's after another year or that was my
      whole schedule. It's just the classes filled up and the demand was there. And, I was pretty hesitant at first to go full blast with it because, you know, every school has a band, but you know, if, if we get laid off or something and I, it looks
      like I got forced, right.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>How do you put that on your resume then <span style="color:red" data-ts="1148.29" data-end_ts="1148.49" title="1148.29" id=c_"1148.29">__in__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1148.49" data-end_ts="1148.84" title="1148.49"
          id=c_"1148.49">__in__</span>, right. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Will: </b>
      That was a risk, but it was a risk that paid off. I think. So that was, that was maybe about 15 years ago.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Yeah. It sounds like that was kind of the breakthrough point though, when you got this, this person to all of a sudden start with doing some funding, you know, it w and it was sort of the simple matter of like showing some P some kids having
        success. Now, what do you think that a part of it was that you had put together a program that didn't require a huge amount of musical background? I mean, was that, was that a part of the allure of it, which was that it could be, it could be
        approached by a wide variety of, of potential students. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Will: </b>
      Oh yeah. I mean, I always give this advice, like, when people are pitching new classes, is that administrators of a school they're kind of, they have kind of an overwhelming job of, of making all of these moving pieces work together. And if
      your new class can solve some of their problems, that's a way more compelling argument, then look at how educational this is, right. Or, or
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>We, we just need to, we should be doing this, right. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Will: </b>
      We should have five band directors because that's going to make our intonation better or something. Yeah. And some, you know, get back to that later. But, yeah. So in this case, here's a class that beginners can take, it's only a semester long.
      So the time commitment is not bad, it can kind of fit into anybody's schedule. I'm not picky about who takes it and they can get their fine arts credit with it, or they can get their tech credit with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1256.41"
        data-end_ts="1256.65" title="1256.41" id=c_"1256.41">__it__</span>. And it's just like an easy check box. So like, you know, and that's the, this shame of like a lot of schools, music departments, if they have a class like that, I I've heard
      the term like dumping ground thrown around before where it's like, I'm going to get this like unfiltered mass of students who may not want to take the class.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Will: </b>
      And it takes that, flips it on its head and says, well, here's a class that is so popular now that there are more kids taking this class than there are in the band program. And it doesn't compete with the band program, if anything, it competes
      with other one semester one-off classes. So, you know, they might take that instead of, they might take music tech instead of psychology, but they're not going to take it instead of band. So, yeah, I think, but see, so when you find success
      with the administration, then you start getting pushback from other parties in the other music, teachers might be pushing back. And, and so we, yeah, that's something we write about where we take it through all the different stakeholders and
      what they might say about it.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>I think it's important. So like, the name of the book is actually electronic music school, a contemporary approach to teaching musical creativity. And, and I do think that it's really important there, there's a couple of important words
        there, first of all, your, your dedication to school and education, but also this idea that it's contemporary approach. One of the parts of the book that I found really fascinating was you talking about developing sort of like John rhe
        focused lessons and how you kind of pay attention to when something is coming on as a genre, that's going to be engaging. And also how to, how to recognize when all of a sudden, you know, that's going to make you look like a dinosaur. And I
        thought that that was a really savvy thing to talk about because man, it's, it's so easy to sort of like lose a connection with what is contemporary and a 17 year old will just clock you </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Will: </b>
      Out. Yes. I'm glad you picked up on that, because that is, I think a lot of music teachers who would like to do this, that's their fear is that either they say something like, I'm not cool enough to teach that, or they say like, you know, I
      don't want to look foolish. Like I am cool and I don't want to look <span style="color:red" data-ts="1405.38" data-end_ts="1405.59" title="1405.38" id=c_"1405.38">__for__</span> and teaching the wrong stuff. Or the kids don't like my music or
      something. And it's like, that is, I mean, to me, that's the most fun part of the job is getting to like, have, you know, have like a finger to the wind of like what those trends are and just following them. And I think that's kind of fun,
      cause I'm always getting to listen to new music that way, and I'm not just gonna, you know, put on Radiohead and whatever else I was listening to in college, you know, like most people do.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Will: </b>
      And I'm always going to hear something new, probably a little before people hear it, you know, regularly. So, I mean, that's, that's an interesting one, you know, that started with, the very first version of the sampling project when I would
      start teaching kids how to sample things from the wild. I mean, at the time when we first started out, it was like, bring your iPod in and I will attach it to the computer and download your songs. Now it's like grab something off of YouTube or
      something that is like the secret espionage project for me is when I'm going around and helping people sample stuff. I can, I can see, oh, well we live in Ohio. So 21 pilots is like a popular band. And I know that that's like mainstream here.
      So like, oh, I see you're one of those people.
    </p>

      <b>Will: </b>
      Okay, good. And then I see this other person that's like, you know, into some oldies. And that's always interesting to me cause like, they're all, these are different than my oldest. So it's like, you know, we'll go through like a weird
      Fleetwood Mac phase where there's a bunch of kids into that. It's like, oh, interesting. You know, that must be what your parents brought you up on. And you know, and then there's always, you know, the real cutting edge kids that are trying to
      pick things that nobody's heard before. And that's where you get this really interesting, like research almost of like an interesting, okay, so the music snobs are listening to this and I can identify the more basic tastes with this kind of
      song. And you know, their parents are about this old and like, you can just kind of piece pieced together and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1541.48" data-end_ts="1541.63" title="1541.48" id=c_"1541.48">__you__</span>, I mean, that's like,
      the, the trick right now is actually, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1545.62" data-end_ts="1545.8" title="1545.62" id=c_"1545.62">__I'm__</span>, I'm bringing on like a helper to help me with the electronic music group next year.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Will: </b>
      And I was explaining to her like what the first day is like, cause that's where the highest and the kids, you know, we'll kind of put the music group together. And like the first median is like, let's do the white board with all the songs you
      want to do. And you know, I always make my own list and that I don't share like any of it at that median, but I just try to like predict what it's going to be based on previous trends. And then I can see how far off I was. So I was like, yeah,
      start making your playlist and then be ready to just Chuck it out the window.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>That's funny. Well, now you, you mentioned this idea of like the, electronic music group. Another part of your book talks about sort of integrating the classroom after school, but also providing a place for people who kind of want to embrace
        this as their primary, you know, students that want to embrace this as kind of their primary educational effort. Right. Again, that's something that is kind of unusual, but it's something that you, you put in some focus on. What is it that
        you saw in your experience that led you down the path of saying well, in addition to just having classes and maybe an afterschool program that putting together, you know, standalone groups and kind of like club, like groups was an important
        part of this, </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Will: </b>
      That comes all from like the band training, cause a good band program. Doesn't just have a band class, it's got a marching band, a pep band and jazz band, ensembles, there's individual things. There's big groups, there's fun stuff. There's
      serious stuff. That's all of that came from that expectation of like, what does a fully fledged program look like hands? So you know, of all of the activities that you'd list in a given week, like, you know, we've got music tech one and two,
      the classes we've got the TV production class, which includes mostly advanced students from those classes. Cause they all know me. There's recording club, which is just like open studio time there's film club, which is just like, let's sit
      around and talk about movies. That's like younger kids that are in that one. There's an EMG that meets twice a week and that's like the most advanced.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Will: </b>
      And so it's like, you've got someone and they're all like the ones that are for the younger kids are often run by the ones, the older kids. So like there's, you know, leadership from the TV class runs film club. EMG is pretty involved with the
      recording club kids and you know, having them open the gigs up and stuff, in a way that's like you've got your recruiting pipeline of kids who are really into this stuff and want to spend time and have time to spend do an extra. And that's,
      that's what makes it fully fledged as you've got a home for some of these kids that may not have that in the other parts of the music department and you know, it's, that kind of stuff just adds the cache to, the program because then your
      average freshmen coming into music tech one sees all these posters on the wall with like album covers and kids performing. And it just looks like there's a lot of good stuff coming on. And that, I mean that literally makes the basic lessons
      more teachable because then they trust you more and they say, oh, this guys look at all that performance crap over there. That's this must be a happening place. I can, I can trust her.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Right. Yeah. That's that's, that's awesome. Yeah. I hadn't really thought about trust being an important part of this, but it really, it really is. And it's interesting cause that you talk about this as sort of like paralleling traditional
        band type stuff. I guess I never really thought about it in that way. Of course I'm not a band teacher, so why would I, but this idea that part of what you do in a full fledged music program <span style="color:red" data-ts="1801.42"
          data-end_ts="1801.51" title="1801.42" id=c_"1801.42">__at__</span> an high school is sort of like have drum Corps in some, it was some of your best drummers, older drummers are in there kind of teaching the younger drummers, how to act, how
        to work out, to practice all these kinds of things. There's a lot of modeling that goes on as a result of that. And I can see where what you're doing here really does have that kind of modeling orientation to it. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Will: </b>
      You don't have to work as hard if the kids are pushing each other too. And so, you know, when you've got the EMG group working together or the TV studio group, and they all have like a deadline of getting the show done by a certain time, you
      know, that's basically all I do in that class after we like learn the basics, it's like, you know, every day I just got the whiteboard of all the different video projects that we're working on. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1851.12"
        data-end_ts="1851.35" title="1851.12" id=c_"1851.12">__That's__</span> a status update. Give me an update, give me an update, give me an update. All right. When are you filming this? And we just start putting the weekly schedule together and
      it's like, okay, let's, let's do it. Let's get it done. I want to see it. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1862.94" data-end_ts="1863.09" title="1862.94" id=c_"1862.94">__He__</span>, it becomes like a project management kind of role instead of
      a, I'm going to tell you everything that you need to do role.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Now, you mentioned before that, you know, a lot of times people get, when they look at something like music tech, they get worried about how formal, you know, the formalism of training and how it might align with educational processes or
        expectations. And I'm wondering how do you, how do you deal with that? How do you deal with that in a, because frankly, a lot of times educational institutions can have a certain amount of politics around teaching process, around educational
        goals, around formalism that you have got to have to deal with in some way, right? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Will: </b>
      Not as much as you might think, because like when the rubber meets the road in, in an average high school, medium size like ours, the administration is concerned about the students having fun and feeling successful in the thing that's not
      required. So whether that's an afterschool group or an elective class, there's no state requirements about it. Music standards and such hard written in an open enough way that you can interpret most of your activities through them. So from the
      like official level, they're mainly <span style="color:red" data-ts="1954.47" data-end_ts="1954.65" title="1954.47" id=c_"1954.47">__because__</span> at least, you know, in my experience administration, the people who are like can fire you are
      they're, they're concerned with people being happy, like a customer service, kind of a standpoint. Now, other music teachers, when you're trying to sell them on the idea of let's do a class on basically bedroom beat making where it's, it's real
      informal and it's based on pop music, that's where people kind of bristle.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Will: </b>
      Sometimes they say we have like a series of quotes in there. Things people have said to us, but it's usually some variation on like, this is cheating. You are skipping all of the steps that we were taught were required. And you know, my answer
      to that is we were taught those steps because of requirements that existed at one point. So we're, you know, why is it that in college we're taught basic piano and basic theory, and then you can do counterpoint and writing melodies later,
      versus what people on the ground do, which is they pick up a guitar and learn a few chords and they just start singing over it. So like there's a huge divide. And a lot of that's based on what was accessible and what is now accessible is very
      different than what was, when a lot of those theory texts were being, you know, devised and flip that all on its head and say, you have a group of students who normally would not be taking any music class.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Will: </b>
      They would not, they would be taking gym or something instead. And so the expectations for like, what are you doing? That's better than that is like, anything you're doing is going to be better than not taking a class. So what do they need to
      know? You know, like, we're writing electronic music, they'll need to know how to program drum beats. And so instead of learning how to drum in real time, we just need to know a couple of the rules of drumming and where to, you know, how do you
      put the snares on two and four? And how do you make a couple of different, very common kick drum grooves, and you know, the kind of stuff that a average drum set player would learn right at the beginning, but not even in real time, because you
      can just program it. And so now, you know, we've got an interface like, you know, now the class has a push at every station.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Will: </b>
      So how much counting do we need to learn when it's musical counting? You know, it's like, I need to, I need to be able to count eight bars and I need to be able to see beats 1, 2, 3, and four. Do I need to know one end of the two we had, I, I
      might say that just so the musicians know what they're looking at, but the ones who don't and it's just every box and they're like four, four, those is one B and it's all symbolic. And it stays symbolic instead of meeting like an English
      definition. It's the same with the chord progressions, where it's closer to what a guitarist would learn, where it's like a guitarist is going to learn some basic chords and they might just be happy living there their whole life. They don't
      need to know a lot about playing in different keys.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Will: </b>
      They just need to know they might need to move the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2159.7" data-end_ts="2160.39" title="2159.7" id=c_"2159.7">__cable__</span>. And so it's like on the, on the push, it's like, well, you need to know this shape
      and you need to know that the blue one needs to be on the left. And, and then when you moved to the other one, that's where you start. And then when you move to other ones up and down, sounds pretty good. Diagonal sounds pretty good. There's
      all the chords that you'd be learning on guitar, probably. So let's just, there's our chess moves for that piece. And, and it's like, you don't need to <span style="color:red" data-ts="2190.15" data-end_ts="2190.44" title="2190.15"
        id=c_"2190.15">__see__</span>, you know, what formal terms would I be using in that case? Like, we're going to press the scales button and see a bunch of formal terms and the word scale and the word cord. Do I need to know a lot about sharps
      and flats?
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Will: </b>
      Maybe not, you know, might I throw an image of a piano up on the screen and say like, if you need to transpose, here's a little map of how many you need to move to get to that next T, but it's almost like you're working backwards from your goal
      instead of let's start at the beginning of time and learn about music theory and just learn about music theory. We're just like learning what we need to know for that project. So like, you know, I did, you know, up until I started doing like
      the future-based project, I wasn't really dealing with seventh chords, but it sounded like a lot of those songs are using seventh chords. So I'm like, all right, well, here's how you do a seventh chord. It just has four notes and you make a
      zigzag instead of a triangle. We're not concerned with like how many half steps are in between each one.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Will: </b>
      Cause you know, for the, for most students, like I said before, they're on the tour, you know, they want to say, how do I make beats with this stuff? And well here, let me get you there really easy and painlessly. And there's always students
      who want to know more that will like inquire more and maybe seek out things on their own more. But that's not like the feature of the class, the feature of the class is mainly, let's make music together and let's make 10 projects over the
      course of a semester that are satisfying. No matter what level you're at, this is going to be a good experience. So you

      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Said that when you started this, you had old bubble IMX and, and you were using garage band at some point you, embraced Ableton as your teaching tool. You mentioned now that you have pushes at the stations, but also you're getting a lot of
        attention from <span style="color:red" data-ts="2309.39" data-end_ts="2309.66" title="2309.39" id=c_"2309.39">__eight__</span> tend to, first of all, what, what, what caused you to make the switch to Ableton? And, secondly, to what extent
        have you been interacting with them and getting kind of resourcing help from them? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Will: </b>
      First time we use Ableton live was for when we started the music tech two class, I felt like we needed, if we were doing an advanced class, we should use some professional software. And at the time Ableton live was the only thing that would run
      on those computers. And I was comfortable with it too. I, I had to do something, there was something I had to do that needed. Like it was the only sampler I could get to work, for this project I was performing with and I'd used it for my
      master's degree and things like that. So I was, I was pretty comfortable with it and I, I knew that if nothing else, this is going to let us sample stuff and garage band doesn't <span style="color:red" data-ts="2365.53" data-end_ts="2365.74"
        title="2365.53" id=c_"2365.53">__right__</span> at the time. So, so I knew that like, okay, because of that, we can do, you know, a drum and bass project.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Will: </b>
      We can do a, you know, we can, we can do a break beats kind of thing. We can, you know, make that kind of music on top of the synth stuff we were doing with garage bands. So, you know what I'm, I'm trying to think like how I initially got
      introduced to those guys. And I think so like when I very first started out and I was trying to get network with people, I took a summer job, with sound tree, the division of cork that was installing like GEC labs and stuff like that. And, you
      know, they would just like fly you to Georgia and there'd be a brand new high school with a bunch of boxes waiting for you and you just start putting things together. And I, you know, I, Jim Franco was the boss of that and, you know, he was, he
      had a part on their website where they had lesson plans.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Will: </b>
      So I submitted some lesson plans to him. I feel like, he organized something with the Ableton guys and maybe rich monk over at USC. And they was like, he had a few people he knew were into Ableton live and a couple people from Ableton and rich
      monk. And we all just kind of worked through his lesson plans together for a weekend. And I think that's where I initially like met those guys and, you know, just told them about what I was doing at that point. I had already started EMG and had
      the two levels of the class and we were using able to live in class. So I think that just kind of caught their attention as unusual for, you know, 2010 or whenever that was very few people were teaching music tech, but also very few even
      smaller numbers were using their stuff.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Will: </b>
      Right. And you know, in a way as I used it more and more, you know, I was starting kids on garage band and then moving them to live, like when we got to the advanced stuff and like the further we went, I was, I was like, this transition's not
      necessary. Like, all I need to do is come up with, you know, a way to get the loop library visible and get a better default template. And we basically got project ban, but we don't have to switch programs. So that was actually like for a while,
      like I had a default set that opened up with the exact default set of broadband, where it's in <span style="color:red" data-ts="2520.53" data-end_ts="2520.62" title="2520.53" id=c_"2520.53">__the__</span> arrangement view and it has a piano and
      an audio track and very, very simplified and matched. And I actually, there was one year, the year that I decided to transition, I think I had four music tech, one classes, and three of them were on garage band as a control group.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Will: </b>
      And one of them was on Ableton and I just tried to keep them on pace with each other. And I didn't even tell him that any of this was happening. They eventually figured out like some kids in the Ableton class were like, are we using different
      software than the other classes? And I was like, I don't know what you're talking about. And, and that was, that was when I realized I can just like, keep everybody on Ableton and standardize it. So that way kids go down to the recording studio
      in my <span style="color:red" data-ts="2566.52" data-end_ts="2566.73" title="2566.52" id=c_"2566.52">__ad__</span> matches, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2567.45" data-end_ts="2568.02" title="2567.45" id=c_"2567.45">__it's__</span> need to
      just do audio for a video project. They all know how to use it. That just became easy to do it that way. And the push stuff came later, but yeah, that was, that was the transition to just using live.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Right. Very interesting. Well, unfortunately our time is done. I feel like I've only gotten through half of the conversation here, but, before I let you go, your book just came out. People are starting to get copies in their hands now, which
        means that you're sitting around with tons of free time. What's next? What's next in the hopper from you? </i>

      <b>Will: </b>
      Man next is, get my own kids through high school. I think, this is this year. My daughter's going to be my student for the first time. So that's going to be interesting. I mean, I have a love, hate relationship with writing as you know, Ethan
      and VJ will both tell you <span style="color:red" data-ts="2625.73" data-end_ts="2625.91" title="2625.73" id=c_"2625.73">__that__</span>, like I dread it, I put it off, I procrastinate and then I'll just like, just spit it all out over two
      weeks. And then, you know, it's just like pulling teeth. So I don't know, I I'm supposed to be, we are contracted to do a second edition of interactive composition and, that's going to come at some point with, with better projects. You know,
      when I, you know, we're both under less pressure with that project, I think, than we were with the first one. So, we're taking our leisurely time with, which is probably healthy for both of us.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Will: </b>
      And you know, and the other thing is just like rebuilding the program after COVID, you know, everything kind of took a year off. So, you know, the class enrollment numbers look great for next year, so we're, you know, it's, it's gonna be fine.
      You know, I've got to recruit a new EMG for next year and, you know, get every to get all the studio stuff working again. But it's a, teaching's a funny profession because you know, there's not necessarily an end point. There's like you get to
      a point where you feel like it's all working and satisfactory and you've, you've tried to help other people as much as possible. And, and then you just kind of like, you built the machine and you watch it go. So, that's, that's kind of the next
      thing we're also, I am involved with time. I should mention that. Like, that's another thing that we're, you know, rolling out some teacher training programs through that charity that's, hopefully it'll be seen some of the light of day soon.
      What is the name of it? Again, it's a time technology and music education and it's a car main thing that we do is organize <span style="color:red" data-ts="2733.53" data-end_ts="2734.56" title="2733.53" id=c_"2733.53">__tech-based__</span>
