<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, today I have the pleasure of getting a chance to talk to Ross Lemon from Lamond Designs. He's one of the big time case makers out there, but he's also really active in the community, in the community of modular synthesizers, synth, system development. I see him often on the Facebook groups and stuff like that. So he is a real active part of the community and I have not interviewed anyone who's a case builder yet for this. And since cases are such an integral part of how we put together modular systems, I thought it'd be smart to talk to somebody about it. And Ross was nice enough to be willing to do it. So with that, we'll say hello to Ross. Hey Ross. How's it going? Good 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross Lamond: </b>Evening, sir. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm all right. Thanks a lot for taking time outta your schedule to have a chat. This is really cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross: </b>No problem at all. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So let's, first of all, why don't we start off by you explaining a little bit about Laman Designs and talk specifically about what your specialties are. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross: </b>I suppose the first thing to, to remember about anything that deals with me is I'm self-taught. I just wanted to, to do it through the, the story if you, when <span style="color:red" data-ts="90.365" data-end_ts="90.445" title="90.365" id=c_"90.365">__you__</span> hear the story about me getting into modular. But I started it because I wanted to make a pretty case. I had a, a <span style="color:red" data-ts="99.205" data-end_ts="99.365" title="99.205" id=c_"99.205">__built__</span> for nine new system from, Darren <span style="color:red" data-ts="101.595" data-end_ts="101.885" title="101.595" id=c_"101.595">__Ager__</span> who does the bug brand stuff now. And he was selling it. I was there to pick up a drum machine and it was, it looked mad. And what I <span style="color:red" data-ts="112.005" data-end_ts="112.205" title="112.005" id=c_"112.005">__like__</span> to do is no structure. So you could just plug things in and make weird noises, which I really appreciated. But, despite the fact that, <span style="color:red" data-ts="121.675" data-end_ts="121.965" title="121.675" id=c_"121.675">__data__</span> does great cases with the plywood, it was very, just simple. So I, I find <span style="color:red" data-ts="128.625" data-end_ts="128.845" title="128.625" id=c_"128.625">__out__</span> Matthew Gok had quite a few conversations and then just started making cases 'cause I wanted to, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So did, did Matthew actually like share his designs? 'cause I mean, it certainly <span style="color:red" data-ts="144.645" data-end_ts="144.845" title="144.645" id=c_"144.645">__looks__</span> similar and you talk on your website a lot about, kind of adapting his designs for your use. Did he share those with you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross: </b>Oh, yeah. Yeah. We, when I, I first wanted a case, I've seen Matthew's, case on muffler and, 'cause there's never really that many groups on Facebook at that point, so I seen it <span style="color:red" data-ts="167.685" data-end_ts="167.805" title="167.685" id=c_"167.685">__in__</span> Matthews. And so I <span style="color:red" data-ts="169.085" data-end_ts="169.245" title="169.085" id=c_"169.085">__said__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="169.245" data-end_ts="169.365" title="169.245" id=c_"169.245">__in__</span> my message saying, you know, I I, I can't really afford one of your cases to get it shipped in from America because charges and postage, would you mind if I bought the plans you? And we agreed a price. And he said, yeah, sure. Just make sure you <span style="color:red" data-ts="184.445" data-end_ts="184.605" title="184.445" id=c_"184.445">__only__</span> build, run for yourself. And I was like, absolutely. You know, I won't plagiarize anything. Just, looking to get a, a really pretty case. So he sent me, the, the details to get a plastic 12 u template made. Okay. And the details to the rails. He sent me some brackets that he designed himself for the, the Vs. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross: </b>So he gave me the basic building blocks. And then I asked my friend to build it, and it took him so long. But I, he said to me, he says, well, go see this guy called Dick, who, who runs his own, wood shop. He's an old older guy. He might be able to help you. So I took all the gear over and said, oh, I know Matthew, he sent me over here. And he said, yeah, I'll help you. And in the end, he <span style="color:red" data-ts="233.645" data-end_ts="233.725" title="233.645" id=c_"233.645">__was__</span> very, this guy was very instrumental in my decision to do this. And he showed me how to do another template. So we didn't damage that one. And then I had some wood as well, and he showed me how to <span style="color:red" data-ts="245.715" data-end_ts="246.005" title="245.715" id=c_"245.715">__play__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="246.005" data-end_ts="246.085" title="246.005" id=c_"246.005">__in__</span> it, thickness it, put it all together. And it was okay. You know, I would've, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="250.165" data-end_ts="250.365" title="250.165" id=c_"250.165">__would've__</span> given <span style="color:red" data-ts="250.445" data-end_ts="250.645" title="250.445" id=c_"250.445">__that__</span> now I, I know how tight <span style="color:red" data-ts="253.045" data-end_ts="253.165" title="253.045" id=c_"253.045">__I__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="253.165" data-end_ts="253.325" title="253.165" id=c_"253.165">__do__</span> things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross: </b>I'd probably give <span style="color:red" data-ts="254.245" data-end_ts="254.405" title="254.245" id=c_"254.245">__that__</span> a six out 10, maybe six and a half. But it was, it was really good. But as he was doing it, and, <laugh>, this is where people told me not to swear, but this is the exact sentence that went through my head as I was watching him doing it. And I had an epiphany I just <span style="color:red" data-ts="269.165" data-end_ts="269.325" title="269.165" id=c_"269.165">__spent__</span>, pardon my French, but it was, fuck me, I can do this <laugh>. Right. It's literally, it was <span style="color:red" data-ts="276.665" data-end_ts="276.885" title="276.665" id=c_"276.665">__the__</span>, that was the sentence that went through my head. So I went home and told my wife that, I wanted to do this, but I had to obviously speak to Matthew. So I, I got back in touch <span style="color:red" data-ts="290.005" data-end_ts="290.125" title="290.005" id=c_"290.005">__on__</span> and said, listen, these guys are taking too long. I've seen what this guy's doing. And I used to fit flooring and doors and archades and all that stuff in previous lives. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross: </b>Okay. And, I said, <span style="color:red" data-ts="301.845" data-end_ts="301.965" title="301.845" id=c_"301.845">__I__</span>, I think I can make your stuff. And what I'd love to do is be able to offer people in Europe and the UK <span style="color:red" data-ts="308.145" data-end_ts="308.365" title="308.145" id=c_"308.145">__and__</span> places where he doesn't really see his market, postage costs and exchange rate, et cetera. And, and he said to me, he says, you know, if you can make them tight enough and good enough, 'cause obviously, I'm very aware of Matthew's brand as such. Sure. So I did. I went and spent so well, sorry. So I went back to my wife and said, you know, Matthew's very graciously said, you'll help me. And he did. He helped me, but he didn't give me on a plate. He, he, he, he, he made me think of things and go get my own screws for this. Go do this, go do that. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know, the templates and the understanding of how to do, how even to use in, re rebate rotor bits, et cetera, to put the back panels on. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross: </b>So I came back to my wife and I said, we, 'cause another part of the story is I've been a house dad and I've <span style="color:red" data-ts="358.365" data-end_ts="358.485" title="358.365" id=c_"358.365">__got__</span> the kids up. My wife's <span style="color:red" data-ts="359.925" data-end_ts="360.045" title="359.925" id=c_"359.925">__a__</span> be a principal over in your world, a head teacher, right? So <span style="color:red" data-ts="365.615" data-end_ts="365.965" title="365.615" id=c_"365.615">__after__</span> the kids went to school, I said, right, I can go get a full-time job now. And my wife went, no, you can't. I was actually quite surprised. I said, what do you mean? <span style="color:red" data-ts="375.025" data-end_ts="375.245" title="375.025" id=c_"375.025">__She__</span> says, you know, I brought 'em up. They're all, they're at school. She says, well, what if they're <span style="color:red" data-ts="378.765" data-end_ts="378.845" title="378.765" id=c_"378.765">__real__</span>? What if something happens? I've still <span style="color:red" data-ts="380.405" data-end_ts="380.565" title="380.405" id=c_"380.405">__gotta__</span> do my job 'cause she's the main breadwinner. And I went, okay. So she, she actually told me just to take some time off, play golf, do whatever I wanted. And then I was bored for about two months. And then this thing with Matthew, <span style="color:red" data-ts="393.385" data-end_ts="393.605" title="393.385" id=c_"393.385">__the__</span>, the great cases came along and developed into the story I just told you. And then I came back to her and said, you know, how you've been telling me to fill some space in some time? And I says, well, I think I could make these cases and if you ever speak to my wife, she'll, she'll know if I get <span style="color:red" data-ts="409.605" data-end_ts="409.725" title="409.605" id=c_"409.605">__somebody__</span> in my head, then I'll achieve it and do it. <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross: </b>She went, okay. I said, but I think it's gonna cost seven grand to start off. <span style="color:red" data-ts="418.385" data-end_ts="418.605" title="418.385" id=c_"418.385">__So__</span> I've costed up. And she looked at me and went, well, as long as we can put it back in the overdraft and you're confident. I said, <span style="color:red" data-ts="426.405" data-end_ts="426.645" title="426.405" id=c_"426.405">__well__</span>, the market is about not point, not not, not not 1% of normal business, but it'll keep me busy and, and I'll be able to make nice beautiful things and, you know, bit of creativity. So she went, yeah, right. So I started, I just bought all these tools and bought wood and started making chopping boards to learn how to use the router and the <span style="color:red" data-ts="450.445" data-end_ts="450.685" title="450.445" id=c_"450.445">__biscuit__</span>. So I just made things <laugh> until I've got used to the tools after a couple of weeks and then just started making great cases. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. Interesting story. Well, first of all, congratulations on finding like the world's most amazing wife. That's a pretty great <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross: </b>Oh, she's pretty damn good. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>She's pretty great part of the story, that's for sure. <span style="color:red" data-ts="474.545" data-end_ts="474.765" title="474.545" id=c_"474.545">__Yes__</span>. But also, it's interesting to me, I mean, this is the kind of, this is one of the reasons I like doing this podcast because the completely insane way that people get into doing what they do. Right? So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross: </b>Yes. Completely to me. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>All, all of this came about because you stumbled upon a synth system while you were looking to pick up a drum machine. That's really how 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross: </b>It's started. Pay for it. It's amazing. And I looked <span style="color:red" data-ts="508.165" data-end_ts="508.285" title="508.165" id=c_"508.165">__and__</span> I went, what is that? Yeah, yeah. And, and if you look up, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="510.805" data-end_ts="510.885" title="510.805" id=c_"510.805">__think__</span>, I dunno, I can never remember if Darren <span style="color:red" data-ts="512.605" data-end_ts="512.805" title="512.605" id=c_"512.605">__es__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="512.985" data-end_ts="513.205" title="512.985" id=c_"512.985">__so__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="513.205" data-end_ts="513.365" title="513.205" id=c_"513.205">__an__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="513.465" data-end_ts="513.685" title="513.465" id=c_"513.465">__age__</span> or <span style="color:red" data-ts="514.305" data-end_ts="514.525" title="514.305" id=c_"514.305">__aga__</span>, but he <span style="color:red" data-ts="515.285" data-end_ts="515.405" title="515.285" id=c_"515.285">__has__</span> something like two and a half, 3 million hits on YouTube. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I'm really a fanboy of many people, but I loved his music and, and, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="522.305" data-end_ts="522.525" title="522.305" id=c_"522.305">__he__</span> on the old house stuff, right. And I, to know him through the Electron website, and, I said, can I come and pick up the drum machine? 'cause I know he had to have gear. And then he, he said, oh, this is a drum and you trigger with this. And then he starts doing this little acid techno track in a matter of a minute, two minutes of patching. And I was actually initially, like most people, I was put off, I was like, that's far too complicated. I'm a a one <span style="color:red" data-ts="548.525" data-end_ts="548.805" title="548.525" id=c_"548.525">__knob__</span> per function person, <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Completely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross: </b>And but then he showed me, and then I, I, I actually sold another item, I think it was a machine drum, and I thought, you know, that'd be quite fun just to make noise. So I got back in touch <span style="color:red" data-ts="565.245" data-end_ts="565.445" title="565.245" id=c_"565.245">__with__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="565.445" data-end_ts="565.485" title="565.445" id=c_"565.445">__him__</span> and then just picked it up and started from there, <laugh>. So it's pretty <span style="color:red" data-ts="569.885" data-end_ts="570.165" title="569.885" id=c_"569.885">__crazy__</span> when you think about it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, it is. But it's also, it's the way this stuff has to happen and it's, it's the way that we stumble on passion stuff. Right. Because one of the things is if you try and think ahead of time on what you're gonna be a <span style="color:red" data-ts="583.845" data-end_ts="584.085" title="583.845" id=c_"583.845">__passion__</span>, be passionate about, I'm not sure that you ever have the right motivations to pick the right thing, but you know, in your case, kind of this peculiar thing of like, you have your wife kind of trying to push you into doing some stuff that isn't like work and also having this kind of interest in music, but not being sure how technically you want to be about it. And, but also being intrigued by, you know, a certain kind of sound. All these things kind of colluded to give you something where if you tried to think ahead of time what you should be doing, it wouldn't have had any of the parts of it that ended up happening. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross: </b>Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="625.865" data-end_ts="626.085" title="625.865" id=c_"625.865">__I'm__</span>, I'm very much a, fly by the seat of your pants. I mean, I, I do think a lot about, like, especially now, <span style="color:red" data-ts="634.325" data-end_ts="634.445" title="634.325" id=c_"634.325">__I__</span> sort of <laugh> one of the funny things, when I started this all, it was just a, a little bit of a hobby to fill in time. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I sort of, because of my <span style="color:red" data-ts="644.055" data-end_ts="644.405" title="644.055" id=c_"644.055">__inner__</span> retention of getting things as tight and as nice as possible and picking wood, I've sort <span style="color:red" data-ts="649.685" data-end_ts="649.805" title="649.685" id=c_"649.685">__of__</span> backed myself in a corner of, I can only ever make really pretty nice stuff, you know? Right. I can't, can't release one thing. Somebody goes, Ross made that <laugh>. So it has its positives and its negatives. Sure. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="663.165" data-end_ts="663.245" title="663.165" id=c_"663.165">__it__</span>, and it, it does, it does actually impact on my anxiety levels in a huge way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Totally. Well, it's interesting because that, one thing I would say is there is nothing on your website that looks like a toss off. Right? <span style="color:red" data-ts="678.955" data-end_ts="679.245" title="678.955" id=c_"678.955">__Yeah__</span>. Everything, everything looks impeccable. And I think that's what, across the board, when people talk about your work, that's what they talk about. They, they are willing to wait because they know they're gonna get something impeccable and they're, they know they're gonna get something that is unique. And I think that that's important with something like the modular system, because in terms of bringing together the modules, you're designing an instrument. Right. But if it sits inside of the equivalent of a couple of two by fours, it doesn't feel like a very desirable instrument. And by encasing it in one of your beautiful cases, all of a sudden it has all of the, it has all of the kind of, emotional draw that a great guitar or a great bass or, you know, a beautiful piano or something might have, because there's this organic element to it as well as the pure electronics. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross: </b>Yeah. I mean, I, I've had this conversation with many people, when they, when I tell them, say <span style="color:red" data-ts="742.645" data-end_ts="742.765" title="742.645" id=c_"742.645">__a__</span>, a price for a case, and they're like, that's really expensive for some <span style="color:red" data-ts="746.915" data-end_ts="747.205" title="746.915" id=c_"746.915">__wood__</span>. Mm-Hmm. Some metal and, and power. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, and I always say to them, okay, let's just look around your living room. Do you have an oak table and chairs by chance? No, no, no. I've got X type of wood. So that's really nice. Yeah. Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="763.145" data-end_ts="763.365" title="763.145" id=c_"763.145">__So__</span> what material is your sulfur? <span style="color:red" data-ts="765.905" data-end_ts="766.125" title="765.905" id=c_"765.905">__Oh__</span>, it's leather. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Okay. And so many pair shoes. Do you have, well, I've got six or seven. You, I've got brown ones. Well, there you go. Every part of your life is about style and quality and wanting nicest things in each section. Yet you want a plywood case to put 10,000 pounds worth of equipment, uhhuh. Right. That you want to obviously show you emotion and, and your skills in making music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross: </b>I says, or do you want to come in and have a look at a case from different angles depending on the lighting in your room and catch it? It, it's like, it's like a, a beautiful car, you know what I mean? It goes down the street. You're not <span style="color:red" data-ts="801.365" data-end_ts="801.485" title="801.365" id=c_"801.365">__so__</span> beautiful car. So you have a quick look 'cause it's amazing, but you might not actually stand in front of it for 10 minutes, <laugh>, you know? Right, right. It's, it's, yeah, a lot, a lot of the, the things I do is, is to get that glimpse of that's mine. You know, you're not gonna stare at the case for 10 minutes, but for five or 10 seconds when you walk in the room. I mean, one of the, the things I sort of, my, my little things I go by is I never want anybody to resell my cases. So I put enough effort into it, like picking the route, the right angle, different combinations, quirky things. So it's the last thing that goes at that person's studio. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. I wanna talk about your, your designs a little bit more, but before we get there, I wanna talk a little bit about your, more about your story. Because there's kind of a preface to the things that you've told us all about so far, which is this idea that you were going to look at a drum machine. So you, you did have kind of a musical background of some sort coming into this and coming into your introduction into the modular synth. What was that background? What, what got you started in electronic music to begin with? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross: </b>Well, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="871.825" data-end_ts="872.045" title="871.825" id=c_"871.825">__was__</span>, well from the early nineties doing rave, <span style="color:red" data-ts="875.175" data-end_ts="875.525" title="875.175" id=c_"875.175">__going__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="875.525" data-end_ts="875.725" title="875.525" id=c_"875.525">__to__</span> cream nightclub, and Liverpool in the back room with, you know, Andy Weatherall, <span style="color:red" data-ts="882.075" data-end_ts="882.845" title="882.075" id=c_"882.075">__Carl Cox__</span>, you know, all the proper guys. Just giving it some great sort of like, techno and, and really hard house nights. I just enjoyed that. It sort of made me doing all that culture and the sort of person I am. And then <span style="color:red" data-ts="897.045" data-end_ts="897.285" title="897.045" id=c_"897.045">__right__</span> about 98 I moved to Peterborough where I'm now, and within a month of being here, I met <span style="color:red" data-ts="902.225" data-end_ts="902.445" title="902.225" id=c_"902.225">__my__</span>, my wife Nikki, that we were talking about earlier. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and I, I'd always wanted to make music. I I bought a lot of stuff. I bought like a mixer <span style="color:red" data-ts="910.545" data-end_ts="910.765" title="910.545" id=c_"910.545">__at__</span> a Yamaha r mx one, which is my name on eBay, believe it or not. A couple of <span style="color:red" data-ts="916.985" data-end_ts="917.205" title="916.985" id=c_"916.985">__cog__</span> electrolyte electrodes, you know, the red and blue one, <span style="color:red" data-ts="920.235" data-end_ts="920.525" title="920.235" id=c_"920.235">__this__</span>, that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross: </b>And then I had an extreme lead one you the Orange 19 <span style="color:red" data-ts="925.445" data-end_ts="925.725" title="925.445" id=c_"925.445">__interact__</span> thing, the one new thing. So I <span style="color:red" data-ts="927.285" data-end_ts="927.325" title="927.285" id=c_"927.285">__had__</span> all that gear and with all these grand ideas, but back then there was no internet, there was no YouTube really Internet wise. There was some forums and that, but there was no easy to share and an easy way to get the information <span style="color:red" data-ts="940.525" data-end_ts="940.685" title="940.525" id=c_"940.525">__on__</span> how to set the <span style="color:red" data-ts="941.325" data-end_ts="941.445" title="941.325" id=c_"941.325">__media__</span> up. I didn't understand the channels or how it talked to each other. So I sold, must <span style="color:red" data-ts="947.745" data-end_ts="947.825" title="947.745" id=c_"947.745">__have__</span> been a couple years later. I sold it all at a great loss. 'cause I just, I had nobody to help me. I couldn't figure it out. So I just cut my losses. And then probably, so I've been doing the cases for five years, so about two years before that. <span style="color:red" data-ts="960.085" data-end_ts="960.305" title="960.085" id=c_"960.085">__And__</span> in our new house, I said to my wife, I'd love to just get some something that I can just play around with. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross: </b>And then I came across electron boxes. Mm-Hmm, <affirmative>, 16 steps, four bars. Even. I could understand that <laugh> <span style="color:red" data-ts="972.305" data-end_ts="972.505" title="972.305" id=c_"972.305">__even__</span>, even if, even if I can't program it properly, I can understand that you press play and then you can twiddle knobs and pretend to be a musician. So I've got a few of <span style="color:red" data-ts="981.105" data-end_ts="981.185" title="981.105" id=c_"981.105">__the__</span> boxes and I really enjoyed it. But another guy, a guy called Andy Williamson who is tib on the forum, he came down and tried to help me set up my mono machine and it ended up having a little bug. So we spent all day trying to fix it and even he couldn't fix it. And he's pretty much an expert on these things. And it was actually a little thing we needed to download, but that's what gave me the sense of belonging to a community where, you know, somebody who'd come all the way from Darby to come and help me fix my synth and to show me how to play it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross: </b>And that sort of got into my mind about how sort of cool, and nice the, all the, the, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1016.985" data-end_ts="1017.665" title="1016.985" id=c_"1016.985">__communities__</span>. So, and, and then I just played around with stuff, got like a nod lead. I think it's nod lead, the little rack one. I went through loads of equipment because I didn't really, I didn't like reading manuals. I quite happy reading, but I didn't like reading manuals. So I then just, as I said, came to the, the buying a drum machine. 'cause I know how it worked. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1037.385" data-end_ts="1037.585" title="1037.385" id=c_"1037.385">__Then__</span> you press playing, it's got 16 steps again. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, and then, then met Darren and he was, he was the gateway. They call it the gateway, don't <span style="color:red" data-ts="1046.385" data-end_ts="1046.505" title="1046.385" id=c_"1046.385">__they__</span>? <span style="color:red" data-ts="1046.505" data-end_ts="1046.665" title="1046.505" id=c_"1046.505">__To__</span> eurorack <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's interesting to me that you kind of came up through sort of like the most fertile ground of, techno, which was, which was that whole rave scene in the UK in the nineties. Yeah. You, you never found a group in those people, a a group of music makers that you were comfortable working with? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross: </b>No, no. 'cause I don't really, I don't look upon things like working with, I mean, for example, the last couple of nights I've been in playing with 'em <span style="color:red" data-ts="1077.365" data-end_ts="1077.445" title="1077.365" id=c_"1077.365">__on__</span> modular. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1077.925" data-end_ts="1078.045" title="1077.925" id=c_"1077.925">__I__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1078.045" data-end_ts="1078.325" title="1078.045" id=c_"1078.045">__haven't__</span>, I'm basically all the gear and no idea. But I've decided this year is I want to actually learn. So I was in teaching myself about envelopes and triggers and just trying to get some cohesive music together, rather, I mean, it's okay having an Okta track and it puts everything together and it sounds great. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But I'm trying to learn a bit more than just having this gear and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1101.385" data-end_ts="1101.805" title="1101.385" id=c_"1101.385">__having__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1101.985" data-end_ts="1102.205" title="1101.985" id=c_"1101.985">__to__</span> deal with it. So I don't work with people <span style="color:red" data-ts="1104.705" data-end_ts="1104.925" title="1104.705" id=c_"1104.705">__at__</span>, don't, 'cause I don't feel confident that way. But I, I do like to make noise and I love drums. Drums and bass or drum and bass. I like that as well. But drums and bass are, are just, that's what I listen to all day at my work is just Berlin Tech, hard house, old school 88 90 92. Like your Derek May stuff <span style="color:red" data-ts="1125.035" data-end_ts="1125.325" title="1125.035" id=c_"1125.035">__when__</span> Atkins, Kevin Anderson or anything that's just hammering it and it all day. That's all I listened to. Non stop <laugh>. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I, I'm with you there for me. I can, I can flip on like, you know, a derrick may compilation or something and be happy for hours, just letting it repeat over and over again. Right. That stuff, that stuff still speaks to me so much. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross: </b>It's very much. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross: </b>And couldn't tell you loads of acts. I couldn't tell you loads of names of songs, but I can tell you if it comes on, then it's mine and I'll listen to it forever. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right on. So let's talk a little bit about, about the work you're doing now. First of all, you talked about getting, getting this equipment and making like cutting boards and stuff to get started. Is it, are you using, like automated or like robotic machinery? Is it, or is it all straight hand, hand run machinery? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross: </b>So, so I, I've actually thought of, I've actually asked myself that question many times, believe it or not. 'cause I like to talk to myself during the day. Keeps me happy <laugh>. And it's handmade. But I use things like routers and obviously drills and, biscuits, you know, for joins, et cetera. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But every case I've made, obviously plywood doesn't, count 'cause that comes pre-made. But ev <span style="color:red" data-ts="1205.105" data-end_ts="1205.325" title="1205.105" id=c_"1205.105">__ev__</span> virtually every single case I've made comes from either 27 mil thick, which is just over an inch to, to you American guys. And, and it's, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1215.205" data-end_ts="1215.325" title="1215.205" id=c_"1215.205">__i__</span> I thickness it plain it sand it, leave it to move a little bit and then do the same process <span style="color:red" data-ts="1222.235" data-end_ts="1222.525" title="1222.235" id=c_"1222.235">__till__</span> it, it, it becomes <span style="color:red" data-ts="1224.145" data-end_ts="1224.365" title="1224.145" id=c_"1224.145">__so__</span> like flat and rigid. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Because 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross: </b>I'm, I'm stupid enough to use 15 and 16 inch wide pieces of walnut instead of joining them like everybody else does. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I I was gonna say, one of the things I noticed when, when I looked over your site and looked over the, the photo gallery of some of your stuff is, I mean, some of this wood is just like improbable wood. I mean, I, my, my father was into woodworking. I, I always was too scared about cutting off my thumbs or something. Right. But my father was into woodworking and I would see when he would get fine wood, he was never getting big planks of it that could do that kind of, those kind of surfaces. Just I think 'cause they were too expensive or they were too hard to work with. Or I think in some cases, aren't bigger planks of woods like that a lot more sensitive to the environment and Yeah. Climate and stuff. Absolutely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross: </b>And that's why I'm an idiot for doing it. <laugh>. I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1282.645" data-end_ts="1282.845" title="1282.645" id=c_"1282.645">__put__</span>, I do, you know, the thing is because I'm self-taught, I have no, I have no realization of whether you should or shouldn't do something. And, and if you look at Matthew's cases as well, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1294.145" data-end_ts="1294.565" title="1294.145" id=c_"1294.145">__virtue__</span> of Matthew's cases are one piece as well. It's, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1298.025" data-end_ts="1298.245" title="1298.025" id=c_"1298.025">__and__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1298.305" data-end_ts="1298.525" title="1298.305" id=c_"1298.305">__I'm__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1298.525" data-end_ts="1298.685" title="1298.525" id=c_"1298.525">__coming__</span> in all dramatic, but when you have one piece of wood and what I try to do as well is I now try and put the template at an angle. So it's sweeping down at about 35 degrees. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And it just, it tells a little story. It comes towards you. It's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1312.645" data-end_ts="1312.685" title="1312.645" id=c_"1312.645">__as__</span> if the case is, you know, as you say, it's back to this thing about looking at something and thinking it's beautiful, right? Is it comes towards you. It's got a little bit of a different shape. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross: </b>It's not the same as everybody else. And I, I just want all my customers to think when they get it that Ross is and I have, but they think that Ross has put effort, time, thought into it. You know, I mean, <laugh>, it just, this week, no, end of last week, I went to buy a piece of Purple Heart 'cause a customer was thinking about buying a case. And, and I knew I could do with a bitting anyway. And, <laugh>, I spent 1200 quid <laugh>. So I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1351.285" data-end_ts="1351.485" title="1351.285" id=c_"1351.285">__wanted__</span> to sell a little bit in my studio to pay for it. But, years back to this thing about passion for the first couple of years, I thought, you know, it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1360.205" data-end_ts="1360.325" title="1360.205" id=c_"1360.205">__a__</span>, I didn't, not that didn't fit in, but I didn't, 'cause I was newbie as such with everything. Right. But now what you're saying is passion is probably the thing, you know, just picking the word and putting it together and, and when somebody says just a thank you 'cause it's beautiful, you know, you can't get any better than that when you make stuff <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure, sure. Now some of the stuff that you do has these large form panels, but then the other thing that you are kind of well known for is, different kinds of, striping e either striped woods or bizarre combination of wood bits or Yeah. They're insane. I mean, some of these things, the, the styling is insane. And, and it, what it reminds me of when I see that, it reminds me of the fact that your company name is, is Lemon Design. So the design part of it is even key to how you think of what you're doing. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross: </b>Sometimes if you have two yogurts, they're both the same taste one's, fat <span style="color:red" data-ts="1426.405" data-end_ts="1426.645" title="1426.405" id=c_"1426.405">__free__</span> one's not. And then if you're the third one that's got berries in it, it just tastes a bit nicer, doesn't it? <laugh>. So you try that one. So that's what I do is I just, I think of something and I just try it. If it doesn't work, it doesn't work. If it does then, or if it, as you said, I, I do like mad things, you know, and stripes are, if you have a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1446.765" data-end_ts="1446.925" title="1446.765" id=c_"1446.765">__ba__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1446.945" data-end_ts="1447.165" title="1446.945" id=c_"1446.945">__you__</span>, you know, people go out for a meal, they always wearing a nice pin striped shirt because it looks DA little bit different and a little bit smart. Mm-Hmm. So it's just what I've done. But I actually wait until you see the new one. I'll come out with about a month. I've had about 700, what's about 24 inches by <span style="color:red" data-ts="1462.565" data-end_ts="1462.765" title="1462.565" id=c_"1462.565">__20__</span> inches. And I've had that CNCd out all wavy. So there's lots of mad wavy bits with little insects. Oh wow. And one part will be, say oak and all the insects will be walnut. So you can have the lids or you can have it for the side panels. But what I can do is I can move the, 'cause I've made it so big with most of my cases, I can move it through 360 degrees and catch different angles of everything. Oh 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross: </b>And then obviously the inserts can become striped. Or once I've made the top of the case, I can then use the template again to cut within the other inserts and then put another piece of wood in. So you get these crazy swirly intricate things. I don't know how it'll actually look, but in my head, <laugh> I know it will work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Yeah. Well that's, that's kind of interesting because I mean, first of all, it reminds me of when I, when I read about like true craftsmen in a thing, oftentimes they will do stuff that nobody that either nobody's gonna see or conversely that everyone's gonna see, but nobody would believe that anyone would do it. Right. And I mean this is what <laugh> doing this kinda like CNC routing and then putting insets of like one kind of crazy ass wood into another kind of crazy ass wood. I mean that seems like kind of improbable stuff, but it sort of like takes a person again with passion to just say, I don't even care if it makes sense. I have to try it. Because in my head it seems cool. Right. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross: </b><laugh>, I think you got me there. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1554.035" data-end_ts="1554.325" title="1554.035" id=c_"1554.035">__Yeah__</span>, that is, and and the funny thing as well, so is, before I started all this, I didn't even understand what an ego was. And then all of a sudden I'm getting all these beautiful, great comments and it was like having a a third person ego checking just to see people like my cases. It was crazy 'cause I've never had that attention or comments before. Right. So that, that was a great thing about doing it all. And that's a lot of thing that drives me is not the attention as such, but the fact that people enjoy the fact that I try different things and, and they're receptive to it. And a lot of people come back to me and say, have you tried like, like this sort of, you thought about that. And I take all of that on board as well. So it <span style="color:red" data-ts="1594.005" data-end_ts="1594.045" title="1594.005" id=c_"1594.005">__is__</span> not just me and my ideas. I'm, I'm very happy to absorb everything roundabout me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. I was going to ask, how often do you have people come to you with very specific ideas and like what are some of the crazier versions of that that you might have run into? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross: </b>Well, I don't, I dunno if it's crazy, but if you think 2064 HP in one case is crazy, then there's that one <laugh> that's, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That sounds like bankruptcy to me. But <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross: </b>You <span style="color:red" data-ts="1624.125" data-end_ts="1624.285" title="1624.125" id=c_"1624.125">__know__</span>, Le Lester is definitely, a big time modular addict. Uhhuh <affirmative>. And he has been for 25, 30 years. And he just loves it. And he's a, a composer and he can, he can make his system do amazing things. But yeah, back, so there's all these sort <span style="color:red" data-ts="1641.765" data-end_ts="1641.845" title="1641.765" id=c_"1641.765">__of__</span> big cases that I know I'm known for 'cause there's not many other people who do them. But, back to the one where I went for this Purple Heart, last week was because this guy, I think it was West coast of, USA as well, wanted purple heart sides and I could choose the middle part, the top part and the front part Uhhuh. And the reason he wanted the Purple Heart is when he was younger, he got given tools, I can't remember exactly what job it was, but the handles were Purple Heart and it was a very fond memory for him. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross: </b>And I love that sort of thing, you know? Oh, sure. Old school. But then the more and more we talked about it is, so you're gonna have these purple sides. I mean, it literally is purple wood, it's amazing. Like a little go <span style="color:red" data-ts="1683.445" data-end_ts="1683.645" title="1683.445" id=c_"1683.445">__nu__</span>. But the lid <span style="color:red" data-ts="1685.425" data-end_ts="1685.645" title="1685.425" id=c_"1685.425">__by__</span> the top part is <span style="color:red" data-ts="1686.975" data-end_ts="1687.325" title="1686.975" id=c_"1686.975">__going__</span>, I'm gonna get the gnarliest piece of walnut and the front, we're gonna get the gnarliest piece of walnut. The base will be walnut. And because he said it's gonna be seen by a lot of people, the back panel will be, MDF veneered. So basically it'll look like, you know, Cadbury's chocolate, they have, they have brown and purple together. Right. And it's a great competition. Right. It also reminds me of, seventies disco funky clothes together. So in my head I can see it already. It's gonna be absolutely amazing. So I love stories like that as well where this is going to relate back to his early years of having these tools. And then he's got this new tool that he's designed, ask me to input a little bit and then we'll make it and it'll be exactly what he wants, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well that sounds, that's that's a beautiful story because in fact Yeah. Kind of aligning, you know, once he gets the opportunity to make his own tool, he hearkens back to his youth. I mean that's, that's a fabulous story 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross: </b>And I'm excited because it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1747.525" data-end_ts="1747.605" title="1747.525" id=c_"1747.525">__a__</span>, it's a color combination I've never really done before. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, I don't know that anybody has, so it'll be interesting to see, to see the photos of that. Now you, you pointed out that you have done, you're well known, fairly well known for doing like really large systems. Not only do you do 'em, but you do 'em in a really elegant way. One of the things that can sometimes happen with large systems is in order to have enough infrastructure there, they can kind of seem big and ponderous, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But you found a way to make sort of like the, the sweep and the angles and stuff work so that it doesn't look like, it doesn't look heavy, it doesn't look overwhelming. And it's sort of like implies this, one of the things I like about Eurorack is it's kind of graceful. You know, you can get relatively thin or not too deep modules and you can like build things that don't have to be thick and you know, sort of like ugly in that way. You can, you can have swept looks and they can be very elegant looking. But a lot of times when you see somebody kind of go over that thousand HP mark right there, there seems to be almost no way to not just make it look like an eye poke or you know, maybe even like 500 hp Right. At that point then people start building them really thick just so that we could put anything anywhere. And then the back ends up like going many, many tiers. You seem to, you seem to sort of like, first of all, help your customers make some choices about, you know, let's try and make it a little more elegant than that. I mean, do you do that or do they say to you that that's how they want it? I, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross: </b>No, I'm, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1852.885" data-end_ts="1853.005" title="1852.885" id=c_"1852.885">__I__</span>, the, the one sort of thing that, the level that being a, a little bit arrogant about is I, I guide my customers because the, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1863.065" data-end_ts="1863.285" title="1863.065" id=c_"1863.065">__the__</span>, there's two things with it. The, the one thing is I will never take anybody's money in the first phone call or first emails. 'cause I'll say to them, it's not what you want from the case. It's what do you need from the case? You know, everybody wants a Euro case, everybody wants a thousand hp, but what do you need from it? What are you gonna, are you a composer? Are you like me? Are you just a little bedroom dj? Have you actually thought about in a year's time when you're addicted to this? That's why it's called Euro <span style="color:red" data-ts="1890.055" data-end_ts="1890.405" title="1890.055" id=c_"1890.055">__Crack__</span>. Have you left enough expansion? So I I I like to challenge my customers and get 'em to think really want from it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross: </b>And, and, and usually the first conversation lasts at least half an hour, 35 minutes and talk about different modules. And and I'm not really big on modules and all the functions, but I know like a few things that, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1912.365" data-end_ts="1912.565" title="1912.365" id=c_"1912.365">__that__</span>, to get them going. So I get 'em to go look at all that stuff. I get them on Modular Grid, you know, playing around with it. I, I send them to YouTube. I send them to diviv <span style="color:red" data-ts="1921.865" data-end_ts="1922.085" title="1921.865" id=c_"1921.865">__Kid__</span>, you know, Ben Wilson who does all <span style="color:red" data-ts="1923.965" data-end_ts="1924.125" title="1923.965" id=c_"1923.965">__the__</span> videos. Yep. To the Eurorack section and ORM <span style="color:red" data-ts="1929.765" data-end_ts="1930.085" title="1929.765" id=c_"1929.765">__gloves__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1930.085" data-end_ts="1930.205" title="1930.085" id=c_"1930.085">__with__</span>, 'cause they've got all the videos. I send 'em to Analog Haven because Analog <span style="color:red" data-ts="1933.725" data-end_ts="1933.925" title="1933.725" id=c_"1933.725">__Haven__</span> has a lot of videos when you click on the modules and go down to the bottom. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I say Go search and go looking, go see what you want now, but go see what you want to buy when your wage is allowed in six months to a year. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross: </b>And they're like, yeah, okay. So they come back and, and it's not to get any more money outta them 'cause I'm not money driven. But <span style="color:red" data-ts="1953.385" data-end_ts="1953.605" title="1953.385" id=c_"1953.385">__you__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1953.605" data-end_ts="1953.645" title="1953.605" id=c_"1953.605">__know__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1953.645" data-end_ts="1953.725" title="1953.645" id=c_"1953.645">__what__</span>, for the first year or two I was too shy, too shy to tell people that they should get a bigger system or et cetera, et cetera. And then <span style="color:red" data-ts="1961.725" data-end_ts="1961.845" title="1961.725" id=c_"1961.725">__I__</span> gained a bit of knowledge and through talking to people and being on all the forums and Facebook, et cetera, I started saying to people, it's not enough. You know, what, what are you getting a six U for? Oh, I've got this plan. That plan. I says, well you need more. I never tell 'em I need to get a 12 <span style="color:red" data-ts="1977.075" data-end_ts="1977.365" title="1977.075" id=c_"1977.075">__year__</span> or 15 year. I just to go away and think. And then a lot of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1981.085" data-end_ts="1981.165" title="1981.085" id=c_"1981.085">__time__</span> they come back, they go, yeah, I think you're right. 'cause otherwise what happens is they have to sell the first case at maybe a 20, 30% loss to buy the next big case. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross: </b>So why not get the big case in the first place and just don't get, be two or three modules for another couple of months, but you've got the space there and the power. Right. So yes, I, I tend to challenge them and then come back and, and, and we do work together and then sometimes I will actually just turn around and say No, it's like somebody wanted me to put a handle on the top of a GoIT case and I went, no <laugh>, no. I says, because if you want this built, it's a no, there's no way I would put a handle or holes or anything like that on. 'cause I love GOs as much as Matthew does. So yeah, some, a few times I'll put my foot down, but yeah, I generally wanna make sure that that customer is extremely happy with what I get them. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So now talking about GOs, do you, can you imagine yourself moving into designs that are significantly different than the ones that he introduced you to? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross: </b>That's a funny question because it's a yes and no answer is no because I still love building GOs. If you stand in front of the go, it's the perfect curve. Depends on what width you want, but it, they all feel nice. And that's back to something you said earlier about adapting GOs. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2063.085" data-end_ts="2063.205" title="2063.085" id=c_"2063.085">__So__</span> sometimes what I do is I flip them on their head or I add a little bit or another row or I stretch it or I make it shallower and play around with it. And, and Matthew then once said to me, he says, oh, don't worry, one day you'll <span style="color:red" data-ts="2075.245" data-end_ts="2075.325" title="2075.245" id=c_"2075.245">__have__</span> all, all your own designs and all that. And I said, no, no, I'm really happy making yours because that's what people want. Now probably half my business is, carry cases suitcases. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And you that DIY kit that I do as well. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2090.125" data-end_ts="2090.325" title="2090.125" id=c_"2090.125">__they__</span>, so, but I, I just like different things. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2093.365" data-end_ts="2093.605" title="2093.365" id=c_"2093.365">__Yeah__</span>. I, I'll quite happily build things for people to get the money to go buy wood to build other things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross: </b>Somebody might or might not like, but I don't know, I just wanna try it <laugh>. Sure. You know. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well some of the things that you've done that are kind of like adaptations of the design, like the one I saw that really caught my eye, it was a fairly large case, but then you had like this separate thing that was in front of the case that was almost like a very thin skiff, like mini case that kind of would swoop towards you to be almost a desk <span style="color:red" data-ts="2126.555" data-end_ts="2126.845" title="2126.555" id=c_"2126.555">__like__</span> thing in front of the main case. And I just thought, well that was like a brilliant addition or adjunct to the original case design without in any way, dishonoring the original design 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross: </b>That, that's actually Matthew's design as well, which is, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh is it 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross: </b>Matthew had the cutback at the front of the case. So <span style="color:red" data-ts="2147.465" data-end_ts="2147.685" title="2147.465" id=c_"2147.465">__the__</span>, the skiff has the same angle and then it pushes in, so then you can extend and it, or what you can do is have it as a separate instrument and then you can take it to your friend's studio or your friend's house and then come back and plunk it straight in front and then it becomes part of your system again. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But yeah, that's exactly what I'm talking about. And interesting. Well there you go. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross: </b>It's great 'cause <span style="color:red" data-ts="2168.505" data-end_ts="2168.725" title="2168.505" id=c_"2168.505">__it__</span> it, I always say to people that when they buy a guy, 'cause don't worry, we can, if you need more space, we can make it elegant and sit perfect and 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Find a way to do it right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross: </b>Yeah, for sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So now the other thing that I am curious about is, because you will often do things with really improbable woods or improbable combinations of woods and stuff like that. What is the process of you actually going to select the wood? Do you always have it in your mind what you're gonna get and then you try and go find that? Or do you ever just like go to, I don't even know where you go to get wood. Do you go to the wood shop and just kind like peruse around for something that catches your eye? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross: </b>It is both. That's why I spend so much money on wood and I'm always skin <laugh>. Yeah. You know, like last week I went, I knew I had to get some walnut and I also knew I was gonna sell a few modules and things like that to get the best price. I had to buy at least a third of a cubic meter and then I would get the best places for all the different, even if it was only one plank of this, one plank of that. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> as long as it's threequarter, one third of our cubic meter, it was fine. And I went 65 miles to a place called <span style="color:red" data-ts="2242.805" data-end_ts="2243.205" title="2242.805" id=c_"2242.805">__Nether__</span> Hayford, where it's called Good Timber. It's like a, like a Christian commune. So I always feel that I'm never gonna get <span style="color:red" data-ts="2249.905" data-end_ts="2250.125" title="2249.905" id=c_"2249.905">__one__</span>. They don't have the cheapest prices, but they have fantastic service. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross: </b>So I'd phoned up Jaws and said, I'm coming through and we went to the, the wood pile and he had 27 mil <span style="color:red" data-ts="2260.405" data-end_ts="2260.645" title="2260.405" id=c_"2260.405">__staff__</span>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2260.645" data-end_ts="2260.805" title="2260.645" id=c_"2260.645">__We__</span> also had 20 mil staff, but there were 500 mil white, which is 20 odd inches white. I mean, they're literally insane. So I can, and I don't like to waste <span style="color:red" data-ts="2270.925" data-end_ts="2271.125" title="2270.925" id=c_"2270.925">__we__</span>, but I can then take my template and just move it everywhere till I pick a bit. 'cause what I do is a lot, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2276.245" data-end_ts="2276.365" title="2276.245" id=c_"2276.245">__I__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2276.365" data-end_ts="2276.605" title="2276.365" id=c_"2276.365">__just__</span>, I move the template and have a black marker and then mark it and then have look at it and think to myself, would somebody like that <span style="color:red" data-ts="2283.045" data-end_ts="2283.325" title="2283.045" id=c_"2283.045">__with__</span> this customer I'm thinking of after talking to them for weeks like it, and if they do, I cut it out and make the case and then yes, them <span style="color:red" data-ts="2291.005" data-end_ts="2291.245" title="2291.005" id=c_"2291.005">__someone__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2291.245" data-end_ts="2291.485" title="2291.245" id=c_"2291.245">__then__</span> catches my eye. I'll just see how much money I've got in my pocket and buy it because I'll know in a month, two, six months I'll use it for something. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. Well, that also explains something that I see whenever I kind of just, you know, let your photo gallery run is that a lot of times, like with the side panels and stuff, the figuring will be really, you know, even if it's just a single piece of wood and not one of the kind of composite things. So if a single piece of wood you'll, there'll often be like really interesting things where the, where the grains will come together and then go apart, or there's like really interesting figures and for someone who's trying to very efficiently use the wood, you know, it wouldn't be the kind of a thing that would naturally just show up. Right. But now I can imagine you with your thing kind of moving it around a, a larger piece of wood looking for the, looking for the section that'll have some sort of an interesting expression 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross: </b>Impact is is one that's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2354.685" data-end_ts="2354.965" title="2354.685" id=c_"2354.685">__ahead__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That, I mean, that seems to be almost like the icon now of what you're, what it is that you're designing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross: </b>Yeah, it is. It's, I've, I've certainly become obsessed about looking beautiful. I mean I, I, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2368.405" data-end_ts="2368.485" title="2368.405" id=c_"2368.405">__always__</span> say to people, you know, I'm, I'm five eight, nearly 16 stone. We fats <span style="color:red" data-ts="2373.365" data-end_ts="2373.485" title="2373.365" id=c_"2373.365">__got__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2373.485" data-end_ts="2373.725" title="2373.485" id=c_"2373.485">__spend__</span> 44 inch chest, but my favorite word is prettiness. You know, it's gonna be pretty, if it doesn't look pretty, there's something nobody else will think that way. So I always look at all the gear that I'm <span style="color:red" data-ts="2384.005" data-end_ts="2384.125" title="2384.005" id=c_"2384.005">__doing__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2384.145" data-end_ts="2384.365" title="2384.145" id=c_"2384.145">__or__</span> the stuff I'm doing and, and it's also like, you know, like modules. I mean the people that design these modules in the typeface, you know, it's the same thing. It's, it's like obsessing over the small details to make sure that everybody enjoys <span style="color:red" data-ts="2397.045" data-end_ts="2397.205" title="2397.045" id=c_"2397.045">__your__</span> product. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So this is just, it's, it's really interesting. I'm curious, what do you see for the future? What is, what are the things that you're gonna do to either better or different or take a total left hand turn? What can you, what do you imagine is the, is the future stretch for you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross: </b>I have no idea. The, the, I try not to copy other people. I mean I, I, I pay Matthew A. Little royalty every time I sell one of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2425.925" data-end_ts="2426.045" title="2425.925" id=c_"2425.925">__these__</span> cases. 'cause that was the deal at the very start. And despite other people just building these cases of very similar designs, I still do that because I'm a man <span style="color:red" data-ts="2433.885" data-end_ts="2434.045" title="2433.885" id=c_"2433.885">__of__</span> a word. I then have all my carry cases. The thing with Eurorack, it's defined by the rack, you know, it's a fixed point, right? You know, the brackets and the rails at a fixed point and you can only have so many curves and you can all have it so wide. So that really determines all what, what I want to do is I've got this great idea for a sort of suitcase. There's like really cool aluminum brackets or steel brackets on the side. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross: </b>And then when you lift the lid off, there's no hinges on the back. And when you lift the lid off, it sort of smoothly just pops up and hangs there. It's like an open suitcase. Mm-Hmm. I have no idea how to design the bracket, et cetera, et cetera. But I'll bribe somebody with a case for 'em to design that. I do have tend to bribe a lot of people to do stuff <span style="color:red" data-ts="2483.395" data-end_ts="2483.635" title="2483.395" id=c_"2483.395">__with__</span>. Do you want a case? I just need this. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2485.735" data-end_ts="2485.955" title="2485.735" id=c_"2485.735">__And__</span>, but, not <span style="color:red" data-ts="2487.895" data-end_ts="2488.115" title="2487.895" id=c_"2487.895">__my__</span>, see I look to a lot of the people and there's quite a few people making cases now and I've helped quite a few of them, them. And I'm really happy to, it's, it is like, you know, it's not my market. It's not Matthew's market, it's not a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2498.605" data-end_ts="2498.765" title="2498.605" id=c_"2498.605">__<inaudible>__</span> market. Just 'cause it was a small market. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross: </b>But the only thing I'll tell you is I would just, whatever I make, I will make it to the best of my abilities and pick the most pretty and beautiful <span style="color:red" data-ts="2509.015" data-end_ts="2509.365" title="2509.015" id=c_"2509.015">__words__</span> for each and individual customer, whatever it may be. As you said earlier, I could never envisage being nearly five years I've been going now, so I could never envisage that. So I never, I'm not gonna plan to take over the world. I just go to work and people pay me some money and they let me do what I want and everybody's happy. So I can't really say any <span style="color:red" data-ts="2529.445" data-end_ts="2529.565" title="2529.445" id=c_"2529.445">__more__</span> than that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well there's not much better of a story to be said than that though. That's a, that's a great tale. Ross, I want to thank you so much for kind of filling us in on how you do the thing you do. It was as expected, it was fascinating. And I appreciate you kind of opening your door and letting me, letting me ask a lot of questions even if I seemed like I might've not known what I was talking about, but it was really interesting to hear about it, man. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross: </b>Very enjoyable my friend. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright, thank you so much. And with that I'll say goodbye 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ross: </b>Avo. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Many thanks to Ross for taking the time to talk about woodworking building cases and this entree into the modular world. Pretty incredible guy. And it was a really great story. I wanna thank you for listening. This month is kind of a special month for podcasters. There is a, an effort among podcasters to try and get people more aware of what's going on with podcasting. So if you could do me a favor and just share this or any other interesting podcast with people that you know out there, and if you happen to put it on social media, please use the hashtag tripod, that's hashtag T-R-Y-P-O-D, to try and raise. Awareness of podcasting is a way to get the word of artists and interesting people out there. Thanks a lot for listening. And we'll catch you actually in two weeks. Next week I'm going to be at the Berkeley School of Music for their Voltage Connect series. So if you happen to be in Boston, swing on by and check it out. Otherwise, I will see you in two weeks, when we will continue our Art Plus Music Plus Technology podcast. Thanks a lot. See you soon. Bye.
