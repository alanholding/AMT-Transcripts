<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. I am doing this from the road this week. I am on a little family vacation, and so I'm pulling this off from a hotel, but I just wanted to, point out that 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>As always, whenever I talk to Paul Schriver, it's pretty amazing. And I know some of this stuff intersects with what we did in his first interview, but one of the things I find with Paul is that every time I talk to him about something new stuff is revealed. So I think that you'll find this super interesting. It's really cool to hear about the, how m o t m kind of ran its course for Paul. It was really cool, but also, it's really interesting to hear his take on the, feelings of Radio Shack. The guy was involved with Tandy Corp for a long time. It's just hearing him kind of reminisce about what that was like, it's pretty amazing as well. So I hope you enjoyed this podcast. I'll catch you on the backside. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. This week I come to you, I'm actually recording this on a, late on a Wednesday evening. Nice little glass of wine next to me and one of my favorite people to talk to, in the MI industry. We are going to have our second visit with Paul Schreiber For those of you who haven't heard the earlier podcast, go back and listen to episode number 13, which was, one of our most popular podcasts. Once you get that, under your belt, come on back and listen to this. That'll give you some of the history. Today we're going to be talking about, more about, sort of the process of creating a modular synth company, especially at a time when it was an unknown entity. So, with that, I want to, say again, hello to Paul Schreiber Paul, good evening. How are you? Thanks, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul Schreiber: </b>Darwin Glad to be back for number two. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, we're really glad to have you too. I people really love to hear, hear you weave your tails. It's, you've lived an amazing, you've lived out an amazing life here, and so we wanna make sure that we can document a bunch of it because people seem to be really hungry for it. So one of the things, you know, one of the things that I want to talk about is the process of developing the M O T M company. You have, I'm not sure where I read it, but, I, I read something where you talked about, your initial desire to get into this was to, you know, pick up some interesting stuff. And in our earlier podcast you talked about the desire to get a stereo was a really, was a, a leveraging part of why you got into it. But I would say that you set the stage for a lot of stuff in the modular world that has since become kind of standardized. So the first one I would say, and, and the way I remember it, in the old days, is that you were really focused in providing kits as opposed to, as opposed to fully built items. I mean, you, you would do built items, but you, it, it seemed like the focus was on doing kits. Is, am I remembering that correctly? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Oh, sure. Yeah. I mean, the original idea was to do a modern version of electro notes, which, you know, everybody familiar with analog design back in the seventies and the eighties <span style="color:red" data-ts="230.9" data-end_ts="231.12" title="230.9" id=c_"230.9">__was__</span> the number one source to get actual circuits that worked. And this was a newsletter that a PhD candidate at the time at Cornell University, Bernie Hutchins would mail you pretty much every month. It was kind of sporadic, but he did a pretty good job. <span style="color:red" data-ts="248.51" data-end_ts="248.73" title="248.51" id=c_"248.51">__It__</span> was pretty typesetting. It was all hand typed on a typewriter, hand <span style="color:red" data-ts="252.9" data-end_ts="253.25" title="252.9" id=c_"252.9">__drawn__</span> schematic, you know, printed on Xerox paper, mailed, you know, folded in half with, nothing glossy or, you know, no advertisements to speak of. And it was incredibly cheap at the time. It was like $7 a year or something mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And, it was very poer because he made it very clear that everything in that magazine was pretested. So it wasn't like, going to a national semiconductor or application book and grabbing random schematics and discovering that it didn't work because they were designed by co-op students 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>So instead you could pretty much guarantee everything in their work. And, and so I kind of missed that. And growing up, of course, before that, putting the heath kits together and things like that, what I wanted to do was have <span style="color:red" data-ts="307" data-end_ts="307.12" title="307" id=c_"307">__a__</span>, the next step was you would subscribe to my version of it, and not only would you get the same kind of thing, you would get a blank circuit board. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And this blank circuit board would then be a module that you could build and it would be a fairly high quality module. Even though back then we didn't have access to, low cost <span style="color:red" data-ts="334.92" data-end_ts="335.21" title="334.92" id=c_"334.92">__over__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="335.27" data-end_ts="335.49" title="335.27" id=c_"335.27">__sea__</span> circuit boards, and we're talking the late nineties, 96, 97, 98 timeframe mm-hmm. <affirmative>, you could, you could still get boards made locally in Dallas, for about $7 a piece. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And so my plan was to charge something like $15 and come out maybe four to six times a year 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And by the end of the first year, you would have a little mono cent, for example. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Right. Now, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="369.15" data-end_ts="369.44" title="369.15" id=c_"369.15">__This__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="369.62" data-end_ts="369.84" title="369.62" id=c_"369.62">__you__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="369.84" data-end_ts="369.92" title="369.84" id=c_"369.84">__know__</span>, so, but I wasn't gonna do a power supply. You know, power supplies are always a big bug to do, and there's a big, <span style="color:red" data-ts="376.16" data-end_ts="376.48" title="376.16" id=c_"376.16">__thread__</span> on muffler <span style="color:red" data-ts="377.04" data-end_ts="377.2" title="377.04" id=c_"377.04">__going__</span> right now about your <span style="color:red" data-ts="378.07" data-end_ts="378.36" title="378.07" id=c_"378.07">__Iraq__</span> power supplies mm-hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And, because the problem is you have to deal with legal ramifications with ul right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="386.66" data-end_ts="386.88" title="386.66" id=c_"386.66">__In__</span> the 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>United States. And so it was gonna be less of an exercise to the user. So that was my original plan was not even do full kits. Okay. Just do the circuit boards. And so I was thinking about doing that, but then after I talked to some people, you know, I'd realized that not everybody knows about Mouse <span style="color:red" data-ts="410.54" data-end_ts="410.76" title="410.54" id=c_"410.54">__or__</span>, and DigiKey and can read resistor cover codes and things like that. So I decided, well, I'm probably not gonna sell very many, so I'll just go ahead and, and sell the kits, you know, fully, every single part and including the front panels, which also is a big worry because number one, I have no archist at the bill at all <laugh>. And number two, they tend to be quite expensive. And as I found out later doing M O T M, they talk about the infamous, let's change the paint. People get real particular about the appearance of their modular. And this was one of the factors I learned early on is that I was focusing on the sonic and electrical qualities and other people were arguing about the font. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>What I did is I, that was, my local PC board company, which is actually run by a friend of mine and asked them what the minimum they would run for me. And it turns out they wanted a hundred boards. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Well that's $700. And I'm like, you know, I don't know if I <span style="color:red" data-ts="486.96" data-end_ts="487.16" title="486.96" id=c_"486.96">__wanna__</span> sell a hundred. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And this was, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="489.84" data-end_ts="489.96" title="489.84" id=c_"489.84">__I__</span> have to remember, this was before PayPal. The next thing I worried about was how are people going to pay me? Right. At that time, it was all done with money orders. It wasn't this big fraudulent. Now you think about money order, you think about some guy with a laser, you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Know, jet, you're gonna get ripped off. Right. Exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>You're gonna get ripped. Yeah. When you say, I'll send you a money order, people say, no way. But back then, that was like the most stable thing people could do was money orders. Mm-hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="520.23" data-end_ts="520.72" title="520.23" id=c_"520.23">__Alright__</span>. And so that's how I started. So I basically started by saving my money and putting an ad in a magazine, which I dunno <span style="color:red" data-ts="532.94" data-end_ts="533.14" title="532.94" id=c_"532.94">__is__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="533.18" data-end_ts="533.3" title="533.18" id=c_"533.18">__a__</span> still ad. It's what's called Nuts and Volts. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. It actually, well, I, I say that I, I bought a copy like a year ago, so at least a year ago it was still around. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="543.79" data-end_ts="544.28" title="543.79" id=c_"543.79">__Alright__</span>, so, so nuts and Vols is like, a magazine is not the right term. It's more like a, a a newspaper ish kind of thing. Like the old computer shopper used to be. Right. It's on newsprint. Right. But they had a little classified ad section, and I put a little ad in there and it <span style="color:red" data-ts="561" data-end_ts="561.2" title="561" id=c_"561">__costs__</span>, remember it costs $90 <laugh>. And I'm just thinking, God, everything is so expensive in this business, I'm never <span style="color:red" data-ts="567.14" data-end_ts="567.36" title="567.14" id=c_"567.14">__got__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="567.36" data-end_ts="567.56" title="567.36" id=c_"567.36">__do__</span> it. Right. But that's how I got started. And the first thing that I offered was the M O T M, one 10 B c a. Now, the reason I was gonna do M O T M at all besides getting my stereo, was the fact that about a year earlier I was doing work with, Doug Curtis on a custom ASIC for a Radio Shack volt meter. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And I was actually at his house having dinner, and he mentioned that he had a bunch of cool stuff and an outbuilding, his wife at the time had horses and it was basically part of the horse barn. And we went back there and he had like his college stereo, like a TAC 33 40 and <span style="color:red" data-ts="621.68" data-end_ts="621.8" title="621.68" id=c_"621.68">__a__</span> San ESU 9,000 and Sure. <span style="color:red" data-ts="624.18" data-end_ts="624.4" title="624.18" id=c_"624.18">__AR__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="624.4" data-end_ts="624.64" title="624.4" id=c_"624.4">__three__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="624.72" data-end_ts="624.84" title="624.72" id=c_"624.72">__a__</span> speakers and all kinds of, you know, shades of 1974 <laugh>. But over in the back corner there's this huge box labeled Curtis chips slash Bad. And so I'm like, Hey, what's that? He goes, well, that's all my Curtis chips. I got, you know, when the business kind of went bad, I put 'em in there. I <span style="color:red" data-ts="650.89" data-end_ts="651.05" title="650.89" id=c_"650.89">__said__</span>, it's bad. He goes, no, I just wrote that on there. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>So it turns out that we did this thing out, I think it was like an Allen Heath mixing console, squishing the box down, and I pull <span style="color:red" data-ts="664.33" data-end_ts="664.49" title="664.33" id=c_"664.33">__it__</span> out and there's probably 20,000 Curtis <span style="color:red" data-ts="668.65" data-end_ts="668.89" title="668.65" id=c_"668.65">__chip__</span> in 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>There. Oh my goodness. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And so, of course, you know, I'm like, like, what <span style="color:red" data-ts="675.89" data-end_ts="675.97" title="675.89" id=c_"675.89">__are__</span> you <span style="color:red" data-ts="676.05" data-end_ts="676.17" title="676.05" id=c_"676.05">__doing__</span>? Stick them in the box in the garage. And he's like, well, they've been written off my taxes and I legally I can't sell them, you know, to my corporation, you know mm-hmm. <affirmative>, and I hate to throw 'em away, but you know, the DX seven basically killed it. Right, right. And I said, well, I'll take them <laugh> and I'll test them and just give them to me. And so that's how we kind of did it. So we had like this handshake 50 50 agreement where I would sell the Curtis chips, and then the, I was thinking, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="706.89" data-end_ts="707.17" title="706.89" id=c_"706.89">__wanna__</span> basically redo the old digit design, or whatever it's called, <span style="color:red" data-ts="714.18" data-end_ts="714.53" title="714.18" id=c_"714.18">__eight__</span>, what's it called? The one in England, the Digi 80, I forgot what the whole thing 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Was. Oh, yeah. Dig sound. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>The Digi Sound 80. So the Digi Sound 80 was a, series of modules that were done in a magazine over in England that each one used Curtis Chip. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>So it was, they weren't very exciting. They were essentially taking the Curtis app note and putting a panel in Jacks in front of it mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. They really didn't try to embellish it that much, but it was a very easy thing because it's like, oh one chip V c o one chip V C f one ship v c a. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And so that's what I was thinking about doing. It's like, oh my God, I can do this so easily. Well, when people found out I had these, I started talking about 'em, people wore aghast, how dare you use these chips <laugh> <span style="color:red" data-ts="765.7" data-end_ts="765.92" title="765.7" id=c_"765.7">__in__</span> modular, you need to keep 'em to preserve, you know, the scents that are out there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Oh man. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b><laugh>. And so I was in a quandary because that was my whole business plan, was I want to use these chips. And immediately it was this 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Backlash. Backlash, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Okay. About, you know, you should use them for the greater good of the matrix. 12 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Ironic. That's a ironic, that's ironic. That's a dubious thing right there. But 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>You know, what's ironic about this is that I probably made more money because I listened to that because it turns out that these chips were basically given to me for free. Right. I was selling for $90 a piece. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. You know, I I, it's funny because you say that, and I had forgotten that, that for many people, M O T M wasn't your primary business. Your primary business to them was, you were the guy who still had Curtis chips, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Right? Yeah. And so, and that's how I actually, you know, my, my my first website, was just selling the Curtis chips and I scanned, I bought a scanner <span style="color:red" data-ts="840.11" data-end_ts="840.4" title="840.11" id=c_"840.11">__that__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="840.4" data-end_ts="840.56" title="840.4" id=c_"840.4">__and__</span> you could actually buy scanners and they were $900 a piece. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>That's 35 minutes to scan one page. And I made a website, you know, my, by myself, you know, with a JavaScript and HTML books in my lap and hacked up this website just to sell the Curtis chips. Okay. Right. But it turns out that, of course the, the story I told about that was I gave people about a four month warning once I actually physically got the chips in house and had <span style="color:red" data-ts="872.89" data-end_ts="873.05" title="872.89" id=c_"872.89">__them__</span> sort sort it out and figured out, you know, what's what I actually had. So I primed the pump pretty well with, you know, analog cing mailing list and S D L I mm-hmm. <affirmative> <span style="color:red" data-ts="883.52" data-end_ts="883.81" title="883.52" id=c_"883.52">__with__</span> the prominent methods to convey this information. And then I, you know, I had to find a website, and this is back when websites were fairly expensive. They, you know, a cheap website back then was probably, you know, a hosting service was probably a hundred dollars a month 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And, <span style="color:red" data-ts="905.12" data-end_ts="905.41" title="905.12" id=c_"905.12">__then__</span> it all set up. <span style="color:red" data-ts="906.6" data-end_ts="906.89" title="906.6" id=c_"906.6">__Then__</span> I went out and bought a bunch of boxes and I bought sheets of foam and I bought Avery labels and I was ready to go. And I finally got excited because what I had done is ask people if you're really serious about buying Curtis chips. And I actually told people what the price prices were. Mm-hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Send me an email just so I can get an idea. Okay. And so in the four months I did that, I had over 900 emails 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Mm-hmm. <span style="color:red" data-ts="937.21" data-end_ts="937.25" title="937.21" id=c_"937.21">__<affirmative>__</span> man. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="938.36" data-end_ts="938.65" title="938.36" id=c_"938.36">__Yeah__</span>. Now, so here's what I figured. Half of the people are crazy. So cut it down to four 50 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Of, of those half the people won't have the money when I'm ready. Okay. So cut it down to 2 25. Okay. And then half the people want 'em, but they'll find some excuse. So cut it down to about a hundred people. I expected to get a hundred orders. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Immediate, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Immediately. Alright. Right. But I had things like, I've had a prophet five and it's been dead for five years and I've got blah, blah, blah, you know, name every symptom I ever made with the Curtis chip in it. And people look, you know, I was like the savior of the world of analog sense. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>So I remember the day, it was like two in the morning. I'd worked like all day Saturday to put the website up 'cause I didn't know what I was doing. I finally got it going <span style="color:red" data-ts="1002.02" data-end_ts="1002.31" title="1002.02" id=c_"1002.02">__from__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1002.31" data-end_ts="1002.51" title="1002.31" id=c_"1002.31">__just__</span> no e-commerce or even a shopping cart. It was basically click this form and type it in and tell me what you want. Right. Okay. And then I'll wait for your money order to show up 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Right. I went to bed happy knowing when I was gonna wake up. I was gonna have at least 30 or 40 orders. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Went to my computer, opened it up, and I had zero orders. So I'm like, maybe it's broken. So I started immediately buying stuff for myself to make sure it's actually working. Right. That was working fine. So the moral <span style="color:red" data-ts="1045.6" data-end_ts="1045.68" title="1045.6" id=c_"1045.6">__of__</span> the story was in the first week of having the produces for sale, I had three orders. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Why is that? 
</p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Okay. It's just like, you know, a 10th of the, it's, it's only the 10th of the signal there. So I was shocked and, and part of me was kind of like panic, but it, after a while, it did take off. I think some of it was people were just very suspicious because it's almost like a, a story too good to be true. It'd be the same equivalent if, if someone said, you know, I went to this old guy next door who was throwing away some stuff, and it turned out that he was the rolling rep back in the seventies, and he gave me 50 TP three oh threes in the box. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>You would just, people couldn't wrap around the fact and actually bought it. A Cameron took pictures, the chips just to kind of convince people, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> that it was real 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Family. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. But 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Once it caught on the sales of the Curtis chips, 100% funded all of my M O T M work for almost 10 years. And so that was very good. And I got spoiled because I didn't have to front anything for a new module because I knew there was enough ship sales behind it to fund it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>So I didn't, I didn't have to have, you know, module B be funded by module A and I hope that I could <span style="color:red" data-ts="1178.28" data-end_ts="1178.56" title="1178.28" id=c_"1178.28">__want__</span> A, to make B, then I can't do C until I sell more B. Right. I didn't have that issue at all. I never thought about it for a second. So, luckily the Curtis chips, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1190.88" data-end_ts="1190.96" title="1190.88" id=c_"1190.88">__I__</span> did it and I probably over a 10 year period sold around, you know, $200,000 worth of Curtis chips. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>My goodness. So when did, when, when did you run out? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>I didn't run out. What happened was after Doug Curtis died, I had no legal, you know, the, the deal that we had, even though it was informal, his, his family knew about the deal. And so I was contacted and I returned all of the parts at the request, and I did not know what happened to the parts. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Wow. I didn't know that part of the story. Well, when did that happen? When did he die? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>I know, I can't remember. I, I don't, I don't like to remember bad things. Yeah. I couldn't even tell you that. I couldn't even tell you the day my father died. I just tend not to remember those kinds of things. Okay. But, you know, as a, as a footnote to that, deal was now I would, I would pay, Doug, since I wasn't allowed to pay, you know, money per se, he wanted, he, he's kind of like me. He didn't even own any synthesizers. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Okay. So he wanted to be paid with synthesizers that used his parts. And so, I would simply keep track and, you know, I had a spreadsheet and I kept track of every single part, and I was very ethical. And I, and I said, Doug, this is, I'm much <span style="color:red" data-ts="1276.76" data-end_ts="1276.92" title="1276.76" id=c_"1276.76">__sure__</span> I owe you what you want. And he would say, you know, I've always wanted two matrix twelves mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And, and so I would go and I would find, you know, the people who had the pristine, and there's a couple of people I won't name, but some of them aren't, aren't well known on purpose. And these are the people who supply professional musicians. Okay. They're not on eBay selling gear. Right. And these people, if it has a scratch, an eighth of an inch long on the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1303.74" data-end_ts="1303.96" title="1303.74" id=c_"1303.74">__end__</span> panel, they're not interested. Mm-hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>It has to be dead <span style="color:red" data-ts="1307.22" data-end_ts="1307.44" title="1307.22" id=c_"1307.22">__min__</span>. And so, you know, I would find a Matrix 12, and the guy would say, yeah, I've got one that's $9,000. I said, here's my FedEx number. Right. I I, I didn't care because it wasn't my money. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Was his money he had. And so he didn't care because they were, it was free. It was a free matrix 12 for him. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure, sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>That makes sense. He gave me a box and he gave me a box. And a year later, matrix 12 shows up much <span style="color:red" data-ts="1330.48" data-end_ts="1330.64" title="1330.48" id=c_"1330.48">__more__</span> <laugh>. What kind of a, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>How much better does it get? Right. Yeah, exactly. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>How much better does it get? Well, when it, when it ended, I still, he still had a balance of roughly $36,000 that I owed him. Okay. And of course, I still, I couldn't pay him anymore, obviously. So I had to pay his wife. And so in order to pay his wife, I had to sell my <span style="color:red" data-ts="1352.04" data-end_ts="1352.28" title="1352.04" id=c_"1352.04">__Moog__</span> 55. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1353.42" data-end_ts="1353.64" title="1353.42" id=c_"1353.42">__Oh__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And so that's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What happened to your mug. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>I lost my Moog 55 to, to pay the, the money I owed. But I sat there for a whole weekend and I made sure I, I paid <span style="color:red" data-ts="1366.85" data-end_ts="1367.01" title="1366.85" id=c_"1366.85">__them__</span> to the penny. And, I, I didn't feel that bad. I mean, I can't complain because where do you think I got the money to buy the Moog 55 to begin with? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So now, I, I mean, one of the things that I find really interesting is the extent to which you probably more than anyone in the business, is like ultra honest when it comes to business dealings. And, you know, you as well as I know that the MI industry is rife with exactly the opposite. People who don't shave every corner possible to get an <span style="color:red" data-ts="1410.49" data-end_ts="1410.65" title="1410.49" id=c_"1410.49">__at__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>I mean, I don't, I don't have much dealing in the, in my industry per se, because, I, I don't want to really be in that. Right. I mean, I've <span style="color:red" data-ts="1420.97" data-end_ts="1421.09" title="1420.97" id=c_"1420.97">__built__</span>, I've had enough of shaving corners with my days at Candy <laugh>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1426.02" data-end_ts="1426.24" title="1426.02" id=c_"1426.02">__But__</span> to last me <span style="color:red" data-ts="1426.84" data-end_ts="1426.92" title="1426.84" id=c_"1426.84">__a__</span> lifetime, and that was the other impetus for doing M O T M A certain way, was that there is truly an art to design anything as cheap as possible. Okay? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>But, but mentally it kind of gets old after a while because your, your wings are <span style="color:red" data-ts="1444.2" data-end_ts="1444.48" title="1444.2" id=c_"1444.2">__clicked__</span>. Okay. Right. Because you're always looking over the fence, admiring some new part that, you know, you'll never get to use because you're on the other side of the fence that says, you know, we can't afford that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. And 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>So m <span style="color:red" data-ts="1457.92" data-end_ts="1458.04" title="1457.92" id=c_"1457.92">__o__</span> was basically, I don't care what it costs. Okay.

And so that's how I started. Now, of course, ironically, the first I ever did was the M o TM one 10 Dual vc, a followed by the M <span style="color:red" data-ts="1486.8" data-end_ts="1486.88" title="1486.8" id=c_"1486.8">__O__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1486.92" data-end_ts="1487" title="1486.92" id=c_"1486.92">__T__</span> 1 0 1 noise sample and hold, the one 10 <span style="color:red" data-ts="1490" data-end_ts="1490.16" title="1490" id=c_"1490">__VC__</span> of course, has occurred as 33 30 in it. Mm-hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>But it's the only one I ever did. And that's because I had a tough time finding CA 32 eighties, which are the high <span style="color:red" data-ts="1502.28" data-end_ts="1502.5" title="1502.28" id=c_"1502.28">__end__</span> dual O T A, but they had already been discontinued and people were hoarding them 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. As 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>They, as they hoard 'em today 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And so that's what I used. But I went out of my way and I didn't do the oscillator. Of course, I had three, three forties, in fact 3, 3 40 is the V C O chip was what I had the most of because he had <span style="color:red" data-ts="1525.73" data-end_ts="1526.02" title="1525.73" id=c_"1525.73">__like__</span>, received them as ship backs from <span style="color:red" data-ts="1528.29" data-end_ts="1528.58" title="1528.29" id=c_"1528.29">__mode__</span>. They literally took screwdrivers and pulled them out of memory mode boards. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Yeah. And half the pens were bent <span style="color:red" data-ts="1537.89" data-end_ts="1538.18" title="1537.89" id=c_"1537.89">__that__</span>, but, and so I had probably at one <span style="color:red" data-ts="1542.38" data-end_ts="1542.62" title="1542.38" id=c_"1542.38">__time__</span> when I first started, I probably had 15 or 20,000 V <span style="color:red" data-ts="1546.54" data-end_ts="1546.66" title="1546.54" id=c_"1546.54">__C__</span> O 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Chips. Oh my goodness. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>So I could have had lots of V Cs. But the thing about the 3, 3 40 is <span style="color:red" data-ts="1554.67" data-end_ts="1555.38" title="1554.67" id=c_"1554.67">__3 3 40__</span> is designed to be in a computer system so that you can auto-tune it. It's not exactly temperature stable. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1562.48" data-end_ts="1562.7" title="1562.48" id=c_"1562.48">__It__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>It, you're supposed to poke it every now and then. Okay. Okay. So that's what it's designed to do. It's in the profit five where you kind of poke it every now and then. Of course, what's interesting now is Vince Clark came out the day and says, I've got some <span style="color:red" data-ts="1575.3" data-end_ts="1575.58" title="1575.3" id=c_"1575.3">__<inaudible>__</span> modules. Poke your VCO os. Of course they're $590 a set. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? Yeah. I saw, I saw those notices. That's hilarious. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>You know, for 590 I'll hire an intern. Sorry Vince, I know you're a customer. I'm just kidding. <laugh>, please buy more stuff. My children starved 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>So what I did was I started looking through my <span style="color:red" data-ts="1597.7" data-end_ts="1597.94" title="1597.7" id=c_"1597.7">__lecture__</span> notes and looking at some other stuff I had and trying to come up with some designs that were high end. But I did have one restriction because I was thinking I have to have parts that people can get, or, I'll offer the hard parts separately. Like, here's a board and here's the tricky parts <span style="color:red" data-ts="1617.26" data-end_ts="1617.48" title="1617.26" id=c_"1617.26">__for__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1617.48" data-end_ts="1617.6" title="1617.48" id=c_"1617.48">__the__</span> $25. You know, here's the tricky part. Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1620.7" data-end_ts="1620.92" title="1620.7" id=c_"1620.7">__But__</span> that was my intent. But then people said, oh, I want the solder, but I don't know how to buy resistors and, and I don't wanna buy 200 resistors. Like, you know, at the time, if you went to <span style="color:red" data-ts="1631.8" data-end_ts="1632" title="1631.8" id=c_"1631.8">__master__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1632.02" data-end_ts="1632.24" title="1632.02" id=c_"1632.02">__and__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1632.24" data-end_ts="1632.4" title="1632.24" id=c_"1632.24">__did__</span>, you bought a bag of resistors, you <span style="color:red" data-ts="1634.44" data-end_ts="1634.56" title="1634.44" id=c_"1634.44">__know__</span>, 200 in a bag. Right. Why don't need 200 resistors? I just need one. And my wife says that I use too much of a, you know, selling table. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>So I said, fine. So what I did was I went to the local community college and it has a, a two year electronic technicians degree and they have a placement office. And I asked for names of people who are looking for jobs. Jobs. And so I interviewed some people and I actually had some people who would come to my house during the day, actually worked <span style="color:red" data-ts="1664.6" data-end_ts="1664.8" title="1664.6" id=c_"1664.6">__at__</span> my house <span style="color:red" data-ts="1665.18" data-end_ts="1665.4" title="1665.18" id=c_"1665.18">__and__</span> my real job. 'cause this has always been a hobby. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, even today, it's a hobby. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And they would sit there and count parts and bags and that doesn't seem like a tough job. Okay, here, sit here and here's a bunch of bags, count and here's a list of resistors. And here they <span style="color:red" data-ts="1681.88" data-end_ts="1682" title="1681.88" id=c_"1681.88">__all__</span> count the resistors and put 'em in the bag. It was a disaster. <laugh>. 'cause what happens is it's a boring job that you'd have to make a hundred. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Right? Okay. You don't make a hundred, someone's gonna send you an email or post <span style="color:red" data-ts="1695" data-end_ts="1695.12" title="1695" id=c_"1695">__a__</span> post on the forum <span style="color:red" data-ts="1696.23" data-end_ts="1696.52" title="1696.23" id=c_"1696.23">__that__</span> I'm a truck because I shored you a one K resistor. Right. Right. And my favorite story about that is I had a customer on the island of Malta and actually had to look up, where the heck is Malta? Okay. It's a little island. It's off the coast of Sicily or something. And how he's on island of Malta, I have no idea. But I sent him a kit and I was short one 10 K resistor. And he actually said, and I went to the, there's one Radio shack on the island of Malta, and they don't sell resistors anymore. So I actually sent him three resistors taped <span style="color:red" data-ts="1732.44" data-end_ts="1732.6" title="1732.44" id=c_"1732.44">__to__</span> my business card.

</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>So I actually had to fire all of my, I had four people at the time. I kept the one good guy, other three I had to let go because they couldn't count resistors or screws or knobs in a bag accurate. At the end of my kidding days, when I finally got rid of the m o tmm kits and said I wasn't gonna do it. And that was in 2006. I calculated roughly this wasn't accurate, but it's fairly accurate. I'll say a plus <span style="color:red" data-ts="1764.32" data-end_ts="1764.44" title="1764.32" id=c_"1764.32">__or__</span> minus 10%.

Just Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>I just, I just got tired of it. And in fact, that's another economic story about that is <span style="color:red" data-ts="1788.14" data-end_ts="1788.36" title="1788.14" id=c_"1788.14">__if__</span>, for people who had the m o t <span style="color:red" data-ts="1789.68" data-end_ts="1789.84" title="1789.68" id=c_"1789.68">__on__</span> kits, I was, there was, another person who provided kits at the same time who was obviously saving bags because you <span style="color:red" data-ts="1800.22" data-end_ts="1800.34" title="1800.22" id=c_"1800.22">__would__</span> dump every single part in one bag. Literally, you would get a, a bag and had every part in it. And then people didn't like that.

So the solder, actually, I even provided solder. 'cause I'm real picky about my solder. So I told people, you have to use this solder and I'll give you the solder. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. That actually got to be kind of part of the, the mythology behind the M o t M kits was that they were so complete, they even came with a little spool of solder. You know, it actually sort of like added to the story of quality. Right.

</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>So why would you solder with something that collects water? The technical term is bad idea 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Alright. But the problem is, is that's what people are used to because they don't know that there's actually about 17 different kinds of solder you can buy. They just never knew that. So part of the deal was I was gonna show people, you know, how to do it <span style="color:red" data-ts="1892.25" data-end_ts="1892.54" title="1892.25" id=c_"1892.25">__that__</span> you have a problem. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1893.22" data-end_ts="1893.54" title="1893.22" id=c_"1893.22">__Right__</span>. You have two different kinds of solder. My kits, you have the solder that, that is, based with organic fluxx, which is a form of vinegar that you actually wash off with water. Of course you've told your whole life, electronics and water don't mix <span style="color:red" data-ts="1906.02" data-end_ts="1906.26" title="1906.02" id=c_"1906.02">__because__</span> that was a hot thing. And then for the wires, I had no clean solder, which you don't need to wash off. Okay. But Right. When you look at it, it's, it looks the same. So what I came up with is I thought this is the most clever thing I ever did in all <span style="color:red" data-ts="1919.22" data-end_ts="1919.34" title="1919.22" id=c_"1919.22">__of__</span> m o t land was I made the organic solder a different wire gauge. It was a smaller gauge than the no clean solder. So, ah, i, the thickness of the solder, you know which one was which. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Interesting. I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>I thought that was clever. Nobody else does. But I thought <span style="color:red" data-ts="1933.94" data-end_ts="1934.06" title="1933.94" id=c_"1933.94">__that__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, it's, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>I was, I was surprised that people got over the fact that they could actually wash boards and water, because that's what you do in industry, right. Washboards and water at the time. Now, when you use <span style="color:red" data-ts="1946.32" data-end_ts="1946.54" title="1946.32" id=c_"1946.32">__zen__</span> cor <span style="color:red" data-ts="1946.78" data-end_ts="1947.18" title="1946.78" id=c_"1946.78">__solder__</span>, back in the old days, you had to use terrible things that destroyed the ozone, like carbon tetra chloride. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Or fon. Okay. And so that's, that's what it takes to get the, get the off the board as you wash in carbon tetrachloride. So not only do you kill the ozone layer, you die of cancer. You know, <laugh>, it's a win-win for everybody. Right. That was something I was trying to show people. And I was surprised that, you know, I don't know the exact number, it's around, it's around 9,200 kits were sold, less than five ever came back that were so bad that I secretly laughed at the people and I sent them a whole new kit 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. I was gonna ask about that because I would think that, that you would've been put in the position of sort of debugging builds that were just outrageous. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>No, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2001.34" data-end_ts="2001.56" title="2001.34" id=c_"2001.34">__it__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2001.58" data-end_ts="2001.8" title="2001.58" id=c_"2001.58">__no__</span>. And I, and I thought about that and then there were some people on the list who said, you know, what is the retail value of a strange person building one of these <span style="color:red" data-ts="2012.68" data-end_ts="2012.8" title="2012.68" id=c_"2012.68">__O__</span> TM modules? Who doesn't, you don't know if you know what they're doing. I mean, in other words, if somebody says, you know, I built this module I saw from a kit two years ago and I have a child and I wanna sell my modular, and so I'm selling <span style="color:red" data-ts="2025.02" data-end_ts="2025.24" title="2025.02" id=c_"2025.02">__the__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2025.28" data-end_ts="2025.4" title="2025.28" id=c_"2025.28">__c__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2025.44" data-end_ts="2025.56" title="2025.44" id=c_"2025.44">__c__</span> o for $200. Question was, oh my god, you know, it looks like it. Maybe it got dipped in solder or something. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. But 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>It turns out that people loved solder, kind of like people love to paint or love to read. Alright. And that's another thing that's caught me off guard was I had people complaining kind of half serious, but, you <span style="color:red" data-ts="2048.68" data-end_ts="2048.76" title="2048.68" id=c_"2048.68">__know__</span>, I half <span style="color:red" data-ts="2049.04" data-end_ts="2049.28" title="2049.04" id=c_"2049.04">__getting__</span> even half serious. But there were serious complaining that my mo, that my modules didn't have enough parts. In other words, they were too quick to be built. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. They 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Wanted bigger boards with more parts so they could solder solder solder. And it became this obsession with some people about, I want 5,000 resistors to solder. Please can't you come up with something more complicated 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And I'm like, why do I want to do that so I can count more so I can just count more, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>More parts. Right. Exactly. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2080.11" data-end_ts="2080.6" title="2080.11" id=c_"2080.11">__Because__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>All I could just in front of my eyes was maybe I'll hit 5 million parts one day. Won't that be special <laugh>? You know, you know, each kit put 12 plastic bags in it. Okay. I bought 120,000 plastic bags. I mean, that's a lot of plastic bags and landfill and stuff, you know? Right. So it just, it just became this huge, I had a two car garage <span style="color:red" data-ts="2103.56" data-end_ts="2103.76" title="2103.56" id=c_"2103.56">__with__</span> no cars in it because they're full of plastic bags. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And so there's always a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2109.08" data-end_ts="2109.28" title="2109.08" id=c_"2109.08">__why__</span> factor in all these side businesses. There's always, you know, how well, how much money can you make to counteract the wife being upset that she can't get her car in the garage? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, exactly. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Kind of a thing. But, but, but, but the years, you know, the kids took off and I think part of it was because of the, dot com boom, not the company, the economic factor. Right. Around 2000 people had money. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2136.79" data-end_ts="2137.08" title="2136.79" id=c_"2136.79">__Okay__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And they had money to do. It was unique. I was starting to get a reputation. I started buying ads. I, I felt like I was a really had made it when I had, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2148.76" data-end_ts="2148.88" title="2148.76" id=c_"2148.76">__I__</span>, the, the year I went to namm, I had an ad in, in, keyboard magazine. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And so I was like, I'm like a real person, <laugh>, you know, I'm a real company kind of a thing. Which was always kind of a big deal for me. You know, I always kinda wanted to, you know, my father had his own company my whole life and, and although I kind of watched it crash and burn, I was kind of skeptical about putting all my eggs in that basket. Still am. Even today. It was, it was a very good feeling to know that I was quote legit. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure, sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>You know, I was legit, you know, I was getting reviews, you know, mark Vale was very kind to me over the years, you know, putting stuff in, in the magazines for me, and Robert Rich, the ambient artist, was very high. He gave a wonderful review and some magazines that made my sales go through the roof, and I couldn't keep up for years and years and years, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, and I want to actually come back to that because that is sort of, I, I feel like there's, the, the modular landscape right now is a completely different place. And some of it is because, it used to be that, that if you wanted to build modular instruments, you were actually dealing in, an environment of fairly great scarcity. Right. It, there were very few opportunities to just say, I want an oscillator and, you know, click your heels and have an oscillator up appear. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>No, yeah. You didn't have <span style="color:red" data-ts="2255.03" data-end_ts="2255.32" title="2255.03" id=c_"2255.03">__what__</span> we have today. If you probably go to mod for Grid, there's probably 40 different oscillators. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>So now you have the opposite problem. Right. You <span style="color:red" data-ts="2262.6" data-end_ts="2262.76" title="2262.6" id=c_"2262.6">__have__</span> the problem with I don't have any oscillators to how can I possibly pick one of these 40 <span style="color:red" data-ts="2266.94" data-end_ts="2267.16" title="2266.94" id=c_"2266.94">__off__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>? Right. Right. Exactly. You 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Know, it's, it's, it's, it's like going to, a high-end grocery store, you know, whole Foods whatsoever. And you go in and they have 17 kinds of mustard. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And your wife says, bring me some mustard. And you go, oh boy. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh boy. Overwhelmed. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>I'm overwhelmed by the choices of, of OSS <span style="color:red" data-ts="2289.4" data-end_ts="2289.6" title="2289.4" id=c_"2289.4">__letters__</span>.

</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well what was, when you fir when you first got started, what was the modular landscape? So, I mean, the, the search stuff had always continued to be built. So that was like, right. I mean Yeah. Sitting in the background, who else was selling modular stuff at the time? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>It was essentially <span style="color:red" data-ts="2316.15" data-end_ts="2316.5" title="2316.15" id=c_"2316.15">__surge__</span> and pya and that was it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>I mean, that was, that was <span style="color:red" data-ts="2322.1" data-end_ts="2322.7" title="2322.1" id=c_"2322.1">__essentially__</span> and, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2323.22" data-end_ts="2323.3" title="2323.22" id=c_"2323.22">__bla__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2323.4" data-end_ts="2323.62" title="2323.4" id=c_"2323.4">__it__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, that's right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>I think, I think Blais was kind of still in it. You know, I can't, I can't remember exactly. We're talking 97, 98 mm-hmm. <affirmative>, you know, so it was virtually that, that, that, that was it. Okay. That was it. And of course, right after I came out, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2341.16" data-end_ts="2341.38" title="2341.16" id=c_"2341.16">__and__</span> then that's when.com also started. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. A a bunch of things kind of popped up. then.com started selling five u stuff. I was working with, I was working with Grant Richter and he 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Wired Yeah. Wire popped up. Wire popped up, popped 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Up, and then defer, popped up around then too, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Oh, defer. Yeah. He started, but I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2364.5" data-end_ts="2364.78" title="2364.5" id=c_"2364.5">__just__</span>, but I wasn't even looking that way. Hmm. Okay. If I saw it, I kinda went, you know, it went, it went somewhere else. Okay. Right. So, so now here's karma, you know, hit me over the head with a baseball bat 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>But, but yeah, I was, and I was, and I, I'm always focused on my own thing. You know, this kind of interesting is I don't spend a lot of time even today, what, what other people do. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2391.82" data-end_ts="2392.02" title="2391.82" id=c_"2391.82">__cannot__</span> have my own vision. And because it is a hobby, I don't have to, and I, I, I really need the money. Don't, don't get me wrong, everybody please buy my stuff, but it's not necessary. Okay. I'm not making mortgage payments, I'm not making car payments. I'm not, you know, feeding my family. I'm using this money for saving and to put my son through college without loans. And that's, that's basically it. So instead of having a stereo, I wanna have a son who graduates without a single, you know, college loan payment. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That's awesome. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>For right now, so I don't <span style="color:red" data-ts="2429.87" data-end_ts="2430.16" title="2429.87" id=c_"2429.87">__ring__</span> my hands over the retail price of plus or minus $10.

Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>So I have, I have a luxury, you know, when I had M O T M, my luxury was I have all these Curtis chips. Okay. I can just live off the Curtis chips. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>You know, 'cause I slowly started ramping and as I started selling more, I, I kept jacking the price up and it didn't seem to affect, you know, the, the demand people realized that they were legit, they weren't counterfeit, they weren't, you know, I wasn't, you know, killing old synthesizers to harvest the, the debt. Right. There was some concern there. Yeah. You know, and, and so I, I was, you know, I was, I was running fairly well. The trouble with M O T M kits was I was running out of things to build that I, that I wanted to spend the time on, if that makes sense. You know, for example, people are asking me, why don't you build like a sequence or like a nine 60 sequencer? <span style="color:red" data-ts="2493.5" data-end_ts="2493.72" title="2493.5" id=c_"2493.5">__All__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2493.72" data-end_ts="2493.8" title="2493.72" id=c_"2493.72">__I__</span> can think of, oh my God, look all those pots and knobs,

</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Pots knobs don't knobs. Right. You know, the other thing though, that sort of towards some of your, a lot of your later modules were kind of heavy digital. Like the, is it the six 50? That's the, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Right. Well that's the biggest CD <span style="color:red" data-ts="2523.72" data-end_ts="2524.04" title="2523.72" id=c_"2523.72">__converter__</span>. So yeah. At the six 50, I started to go surface <span style="color:red" data-ts="2526.3" data-end_ts="2526.52" title="2526.3" id=c_"2526.3">__now__</span> because I found a local contractor who could do surface mount fairly cheap now, say fairly cheap. It's not like it is today, which is very inexpensive. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. But it was cheap enough where I could sell a $500 module and still make good money. Okay? Mm-hmm. <affirmative> doing it surface mount. And so I kind of said, that was the first one. I said, you know what, it's not gonna be a kit. It's just gonna be assembled. And here it is, but it's really cool. And I still had some people who were like, I'm not buying it 'cause I'm not building it. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2560.04" data-end_ts="2560.16" title="2560.04" id=c_"2560.04">__I__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Don't care how cool it is. You know, hands crossed on chest glaring <laugh>, you know, how dare you come out with something I can't build. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And I'm just like, dude, you know, get a grip. So, you know, I went through that. So, you know, so m o t m I suppose in all honesty ended kind of, kind of rough. Okay. It was a combination of, my patience was wearing a little bit thin. I had lost the Curtis chips. Okay. So <span style="color:red" data-ts="2592.53" data-end_ts="2592.77" title="2592.53" id=c_"2592.53">__Doug__</span> had died and, and I had lost the Curtis chips and I was not interested in sitting literally 20 hours on my weekends counting parks. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>It kind of came to a head in, you know, 2006 when I had lost two jobs in two years. I had moved twice in two years. And I said, okay. I sent out a notice to everybody, this is the end of the kicks. Alright. Kept a very good spreadsheet about how many kits I had sold. And pretty much what had happened is everybody had already bought 40 of everything. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>I don't, I didn't have that many total customers. Okay. Now, I had a spreadsheet that every single customer had a customer number. Actually customer number one is still a good friend of mine. He's still around, still has his system. He hasn't sold it. You know, he's still customer number one. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2650.75" data-end_ts="2650.97" title="2650.75" id=c_"2650.75">__But__</span> I didn't have like I have today where people have, you know, thousands and thousands of customers. Right, right. You know, I had less than 500 customers. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Really? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2666.41" data-end_ts="2666.53" title="2666.41" id=c_"2666.41">__A__</span> total. Yes. Yeah. So it's, it wasn't that many, but they, but they, but they bought lots and lots of modules. Okay. So I'm trying to stall here as I pull this thing up. But, the other thing I found out doing M O T M is a lot of people were initially very excited about the idea of building their own modular, but due to all kinds of circumstances, they were always what I would call one and done. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, right. Meaning, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Meaning they would place an order and they may place an order for say, six, six modules <span style="color:red" data-ts="2708.22" data-end_ts="2708.38" title="2708.22" id=c_"2708.22">__on__</span> a power supply. You know, something like something that's actually, you know, pretty nice and decent. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And I would never hear from 'em again. Mm-hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>That's a little bit more than I thought. Sorry, 604 total customers. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>But there were 604 people who bought M O T M from me. Of those 604 people, one third were one and done 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Mm-hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b><affirmative>. And if you take the number of total modules sold <span style="color:red" data-ts="2738.04" data-end_ts="2738.26" title="2738.04" id=c_"2738.04">__for__</span> the number of customers, what's ING is that number never changed and 13 years.

<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, that's interesting. So people just had <span style="color:red" data-ts="2746.66" data-end_ts="2746.78" title="2746.66" id=c_"2746.66">__a__</span>, gravitated towards, a certain size, which was what that 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Was 12. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh really? And 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Yes. And 12 is what it takes to basically build an ARC 2,600 <span style="color:red" data-ts="2760.27" data-end_ts="2760.62" title="2760.27" id=c_"2760.27">__cloud__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. But 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>That's a false metric if you take away the people. 'cause I had many people who ordered a power supply rails and one module and never ordered again. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Okay. Like their wife said, what the heck is that? That's not going in my living room. Or they lost their job or they went to somewhere else. The people who actually were what I'll call serious users, the average is up around 30 modules. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Okay. Okay. That makes sense. If you talk 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>To, if you talk to my people who are serious, the average is 30. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="2798.54" data-end_ts="2798.58" title="2798.54" id=c_"2798.54">__of__</span> course people always ask, well, who has the most modules? Okay. And as far as I know <span style="color:red" data-ts="2804.73" data-end_ts="2805.02" title="2804.73" id=c_"2804.73">__that__</span>, that, that person, he's, I'm <span style="color:red" data-ts="2806.74" data-end_ts="2806.78" title="2806.74" id=c_"2806.74">__gonna__</span> name him, but he's fairly well known. He's a professional in the, in the computer gaming industry. Okay. Okay. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2812.78" data-end_ts="2812.94" title="2812.78" id=c_"2812.78">__He__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2812.94" data-end_ts="2813.06" title="2812.94" id=c_"2812.94">__makes__</span> soundtrack for computer games. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2814.76" data-end_ts="2814.98" title="2814.76" id=c_"2814.76">__All__</span> right. And he has around 200 modules. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. And I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Have about six people who have between 90 and 200. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>So they have very large systems. Right. But most people have around around 20. So I didn't have to worry about selling <span style="color:red" data-ts="2831.64" data-end_ts="2831.86" title="2831.64" id=c_"2831.64">__the__</span> thousands of thousands of people I sold. Really and truly, I have a had a core group of about 200 people who I could count on to buy multiples of everything I ever did. Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2845.96" data-end_ts="2846.18" title="2845.96" id=c_"2845.96">__And__</span> I was perfectly <span style="color:red" data-ts="2846.78" data-end_ts="2846.98" title="2846.78" id=c_"2846.78">__ha__</span> and I was perfectly happy with that. And that at the end of the day, you know, it's all said and done, it's around 10,000 kits versus assembled Right. Ratios about 10 to one for every 10 kits I sold one assembled module. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>'cause my assemble modules were very expensive because I, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2867.34" data-end_ts="2867.56" title="2867.34" id=c_"2867.34">__sat__</span> there and built them. Right. Well, which would seem like to be a nice, pleasant thing from counting parts until you built your 17th V C O and you go, I think I'll go count some parts 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And then of course, that's when I started on the assemble stuff to have lifetime warranty. Okay. Warranty. That's kind of a marketing thing. And actually this week I repaired an M O T M V C O that was built in 2002. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh my goodness. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>So, so, now there's gonna be a point where I'm not simply gonna be able to get the parts anymore. Okay. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2902.48" data-end_ts="2902.76" title="2902.48" id=c_"2902.48">__Right__</span>. I mean, I can't offer a warranty if I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2905.24" data-end_ts="2905.32" title="2905.24" id=c_"2905.24">__can__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2905.32" data-end_ts="2905.48" title="2905.32" id=c_"2905.32">__because__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2905.48" data-end_ts="2905.64" title="2905.48" id=c_"2905.48">__if__</span> they can't get <span style="color:red" data-ts="2906.4" data-end_ts="2906.48" title="2906.4" id=c_"2906.4">__a__</span> park mm-hmm. <affirmative>, so now I'm back to trying to figure out how to, you know, how to handle that. But, but the M O T M line was, you know, I probably had the best loyal customer base I could ever hope for. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2918.71" data-end_ts="2919" title="2918.71" id=c_"2918.71">__They__</span> were diehard, you know, defend to the death kind of people that, you know, sometimes took it to a little extreme. I got a letter from the Environmental Protection Agency one November saying that the paint that I use on my modules was going to be not banned, but they said severely restricted in the method of application. Alright. Which means you had to have a, these, these kinds of dents and you had to wear a hazmat suit. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2951.9" data-end_ts="2952.38" title="2951.9" id=c_"2951.9">__Alright__</span>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2952.38" data-end_ts="2952.5" title="2952.38" id=c_"2952.38">__You__</span> had to paint, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>You know, Mary had a little lamb three times while turning kind of clockwise and all these rules to spray this paint, it's called pole <span style="color:red" data-ts="2960.82" data-end_ts="2961.02" title="2960.82" id=c_"2960.82">__lane__</span> paint. It's a two-part polyurethane paint made by Sherman Williams that you actually have to bake in an oven. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And I like pole <span style="color:red" data-ts="2968.54" data-end_ts="2968.74" title="2968.54" id=c_"2968.54">__lane__</span> paint. So I'm like, oh <span style="color:red" data-ts="2970.48" data-end_ts="2970.7" title="2970.48" id=c_"2970.48">__god__</span>. And they sent it to me in November and it's effect January the first. So of course the first thing I did is I panicked and I placed this huge order for, for panels with my panel supplier who was in Seattle, Washington. Mm-hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>$17,000 <span style="color:red" data-ts="2988.54" data-end_ts="2988.66" title="2988.54" id=c_"2988.54">__a__</span> front panels. Okay. Which I didn't even have 17,000 bucks, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2993.9" data-end_ts="2994.12" title="2993.9" id=c_"2993.9">__but__</span> I placed the order anyway. And then I had to find a substitute. Well, the substitute I found was a powder coat. A powder coat isn't technically even paint powder coat is basically crunched up crayons that you melt on metal and it kinda looks like paint. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>But I found a finish that was similar to the finish I had, and ironically it made the white silk screen look even better. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Mm-hmm. <affirmative> contrast was better, is a little bit <span style="color:red" data-ts="3027.93" data-end_ts="3028.28" title="3027.93" id=c_"3027.93">__Maddy__</span>. And I told everybody, I said, look, I did not wake up and say, you know what? I think I'll change the page 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Today, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>I have a letter from the E P A and my supplier's not gonna get supply it to me and I'm gonna change it and <span style="color:red" data-ts="3045.33" data-end_ts="3045.55" title="3045.33" id=c_"3045.33">__can__</span> I <span style="color:red" data-ts="3045.71" data-end_ts="3046.19" title="3045.71" id=c_"3045.71">__conceed__</span>. And I actually had one, person who ordered 60 blank panels of the old paint. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Just so they could screen their own things later down the road and still have the paint <span style="color:red" data-ts="3062.41" data-end_ts="3062.83" title="3062.41" id=c_"3062.41">__manage__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Yeah. And so how 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Far, how far off was it in terms of matching? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>I thought it was fairly close. I mean, from a distance you couldn't tell mm-hmm. <affirmative>, if you were six feet away, you couldn't tell mm-hmm. <affirmative>. But, you know, I didn't even try, you know, over the years I've had people come to me and say, you know, you don't have to use these tie TTO knobs. There's clones in China. No one will ever know. I said, my customers will know. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh yeah. Right. Absolutely. And 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>My customers sit there and part of the aura of the modular is the appearance. It's like studio furniture. I mean, we all like to be surrounded by our cool looking gear mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And they don't want me to deviate it, especially after 12 years of doing it one way. Right. And then all of a sudden change in the middle of the stream. But I really think back finally in my m o tmm days, and I am going to have a Kickstarter program this fall to see if there's still interest in doing some of my current designs in M O T M and five u 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Nice. and.com mu format. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>To see if I can raise enough money. I don't wanna front the money, but, . To see if there's an interest. So, stay tuned this fall for my Kickstarter program and hopefully it'll be partially as successful as exploding kittens card decks. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>If you don't <span style="color:red" data-ts="3149.71" data-end_ts="3149.79" title="3149.71" id=c_"3149.71">__know__</span> that reference, go to Kickstarter and type in exploding kittens 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Now, you ended up, one of the results of being relatively an early player is that you ended up sort of defining a standard and your standard was first of all a plate size of a <span style="color:red" data-ts="3170.47" data-end_ts="3170.63" title="3170.47" id=c_"3170.47">__certain__</span>, of certain dimensions and the location of the screw holes and stuff like that. But also sort of this, very clear gridding system for the right, for location of the knobs and the, and the jacks. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>The M o t m love it <span style="color:red" data-ts="3187.35" data-end_ts="3187.47" title="3187.35" id=c_"3187.35">__or__</span> hated grid system and Exactly. And, and the, the, the grid system was done purely to make the modules uniform for the builders. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, it had nothing to do with the, with the aesthetics. It had nothing to do with, I wanted to look like a giant mixing board, or I was copying the <span style="color:red" data-ts="3204.33" data-end_ts="3204.53" title="3204.33" id=c_"3204.33">__<inaudible>__</span> system. It was the fact that I wanted my builders to build A V C O and it had the same connections as the V C s, it had the same connections as the V C A. It was to make the building easy. If I had started M O T M strictly as an assembled system. Right. It would not look that way. It would not look that way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Really. Because, because I tend to think of it as being, you know, you, you talk about your users as being very particular and it seems like the adherence to that grin system is almost like an honoring of that, that sort of sensibility. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Well, I mean, certainly all my jacks will be at the bottom. Okay. I'm still the one of the few people who advocate, you know, Jack's at the bottom. Right. And that's even true my eurorack modules. I don't like putting jacks next to the pot that it turns because the cables get in the way. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, I like Jacks at the bottom, but I probably would've moved the knobs around. I probably would've used more than one kind of knob size. I probably would've used some graphics a little bit differently. Okay. So it, it would look more like, you know, an MU system that has Jax mainly on the bottom. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>But I had no desire to have the silver delineations on the modules, like the <span style="color:red" data-ts="3294.55" data-end_ts="3294.79" title="3294.55" id=c_"3294.55">__move__</span> does <affirmative>, because I think that's a specific, they call it a trade dress in the industry. Right. That's a very specific mode, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3302.99" data-end_ts="3303.19" title="3302.99" id=c_"3302.99">__the__</span> trade dress. Yeah. And I didn't want to imply or copy that trade dress, so I kind of went after my own boring black and silver white kind of look. But again, it was made so that the kit people were happy. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3320.65" data-end_ts="3320.87" title="3320.65" id=c_"3320.65">__And__</span> that's what I was thinking about. I was thinking about, I don't want to have the nightmare scenario of having 50 kits a week come back, you know, mangled. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Like I said, and this is true, it's not an exaggeration. In 10 years, I had five come back five. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's amazing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Come back. So it speaks to the fact that my people were much, they took their time to build it. I had pretty good instructions, and I designed it to be built as the kit from the ground up. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Okay. I've put parts far apart. I used holes a little bit bigger. I used thicker copper so <span style="color:red" data-ts="3362.59" data-end_ts="3362.71" title="3362.59" id=c_"3362.59">__that__</span> it wouldn't peel off the board. You know, that kind of a thing. I supplied my own solder. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So in developing your, the M O T M standard, one of the places where you saw it really take over then is in the D I Y world where, I, I, who, I can't remember the name of the first people that did it, but eventually Bride <span style="color:red" data-ts="3386.56" data-end_ts="3386.92" title="3386.56" id=c_"3386.56">__Chamber__</span> was doing M O T M panels and stuff as well. So it, it kind of got to be a thing. Did these people interact with you and talk about, where they were going with it? Or did people just say, this is the standard and take off with it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Well, no, that was pretty free. I mean, I, at first I was reluctant to publish stuff on the web, but you know, you can go to my website now and every single schematic is up there. It's, you know, I was a little bit paranoid about, you know, people copying my stuff, but then part of the way you can prevent people from copying is just make it so expensive. Nobody wants to copy it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Kind of like, that's how, you know, Rupert Neve does things, you know, it's like, yeah, you can copy it, but it has <span style="color:red" data-ts="3429.4" data-end_ts="3429.52" title="3429.4" id=c_"3429.4">__a__</span> $300 transformer in there, you know, knock yourself out. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>So there's ways to kind of do that. And so once I kind of got over that, I decided I want other people to help me. So I had some people offer suggestions about better ways to make a bracket or better, better ways to, you know, have hardware and things like that. You know, things I'm not very mechanical, so I just said fine, you know, people said is, you know, they would always ask my permission, is it okay if I do this? Is it okay if I do that? I said, sure. And it turns out when I decided to focus entirely on Eurorack, that I was able to sell all of my back inventory to <span style="color:red" data-ts="3470.48" data-end_ts="3470.8" title="3470.48" id=c_"3470.48">__Bride__</span> chamber and <span style="color:red" data-ts="3471.36" data-end_ts="3471.48" title="3471.36" id=c_"3471.36">__to__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3471.5" data-end_ts="3471.72" title="3471.5" id=c_"3471.5">__Syn__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3471.75" data-end_ts="3472.04" title="3471.75" id=c_"3471.75">__Cube__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Mm-hmm. <affirmative> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>To now <span style="color:red" data-ts="3474.1" data-end_ts="3474.32" title="3474.1" id=c_"3474.1">__to__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3474.46" data-end_ts="3474.68" title="3474.46" id=c_"3474.46">__to__</span> purchased all that inventory. And in fact, bride <span style="color:red" data-ts="3477.56" data-end_ts="3477.88" title="3477.56" id=c_"3477.56">__Chamber__</span> owns the name M t m. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, really? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>So, yes. And so I do not own that name anymore. And when I, that's why my, you know, I was asked this question actually last week on, on Facebook. Why does, what is it your, your <span style="color:red" data-ts="3494.64" data-end_ts="3495" title="3494.64" id=c_"3494.64">__Bureau__</span> rack modules? Say m o tms, whatever, that's the, I don't own the name. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. I didn't realize that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>I own the name. I own the name Synthesis Technology. That's the name of my company. Right. But it's actually Syntech, but Synthesis Technology is my brand. So I didn't sell my brand, I just sold B M O tm.

<p>

</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>The parts that I use are huge compared to what the people are used to dealing with. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Okay. And I used to, you know, I spent a year at Blackberry designing phones, and the parts are so small, they're, they're, they're almost invisible to the naked eye. You, you, you really need a microscope to even see the parts on the board. And maybe just because I'm in a mold, but <laugh>, it's very different technology.

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. They, they can't believe how crude it is that

<p>

You know, so it's, it's kind of interesting that we're on the stupid side of surface mount Right. Compared to where Surface Mount really is. But in our, in our people who are familiar with the stuff and actually take the time to look at it, one of the things I'm always, people <span style="color:red" data-ts="3725.59" data-end_ts="3725.79" title="3725.59" id=c_"3725.59">__who__</span> find are people who say, oh, look, I've got this new module, and they always only showed the front panel.

</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Like. Right. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>You know, don't show me the front panel <laugh>, show me the board. Okay. I don't care about the front panel. So I'm still, in fact, there's a Facebook group I'm a, I'm a member of that's called, I take pictures of electronic parts, honest to God. And it's people who go around and take pictures of circuit boards. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh my. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>You know, and it's, and it's interesting to me because some of it's historical and some of it's people showing off like how dense they're, you know, the circuit boards <span style="color:red" data-ts="3763.64" data-end_ts="3763.76" title="3763.64" id=c_"3763.64">__really__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3763.76" data-end_ts="3763.92" title="3763.76" id=c_"3763.76">__are__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And, and, and so it's also much more reliable.

And I don't even, you know, take part in those, you know, discussions anymore because they generally can't be swayed and I can't be swayed. And so if there's no reason to have an argument if you can't try to get some, you know, ground towards, towards the middle. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, isn't it, doesn't that just end up turning into a different version of a religious discussion? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Well, it's, well, I mean, generally it turns, well, it generally turns into someone with a master's in electrical engineering <laugh> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3806.59" data-end_ts="3806.81" title="3806.59" id=c_"3806.59">__me__</span> talking to someone who doesn't.

</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>I, I, I fully admit that, you know, it is tough for a lot of people to, to admit that they made a mistake or they <span style="color:red" data-ts="3882.17" data-end_ts="3882.33" title="3882.17" id=c_"3882.17">__know__</span> what they're doing or someone as smarter than they are or whatever. And I'm just not that person. I've always caught people off guard, especially, you know, where I work now for a big semiconductor company is I don't have an ax to grind or I don't have a position that I'm trying to uphold. You know, when someone comes to my office and says, you know, you really made a mistake when you did this and this and this. I'll say, gosh, you're right. You know, thanks for pointing that out to me. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> as opposed to a lot of people who try to cover up and say, no, you're wrong. Right. Right. I'm right. And, and all that kind of thing. So, you know, I've, I've always been willing. 'cause that's how you learn. You learn by listening, you know. Sure. So, but I, I, I think I'd <span style="color:red" data-ts="3922.88" data-end_ts="3923" title="3922.88" id=c_"3922.88">__do__</span> a fairly good job on, on the M O T M designs. They seem to be still holding their value after all these years. And, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and I just know, I know a number of people have M O T M based systems, and they, they love them in a way that sort of, the trading card activity among Euro modules doesn't, doesn't seem to, to pull together. It, it seems like people really enjoy and love those systems. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>You know, I haven't really paid that much attention on the, you know, on the, I trade forms on muffle and stuff, but I have not seen an M O T M module for sale in like two years. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>I I think they pop up on eBay every now and then, but I still think that people keep them, especially if they themselves built it. Right. You know, they, there, there, there's a sense of pride and it's, it's heath kit for, you know, I grew up on Heath kit in the, in the sixties. It was a major factor. I used to live within biking distance <span style="color:red" data-ts="3984.36" data-end_ts="3984.52" title="3984.36" id=c_"3984.36">__of__</span> a heath store. Heath kit actually had a retail store Right, right. In Houston. And it was part of, you know, between that and Radio Shack, that was a big early influencer on me being where I am today. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Indeed. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>The, that, that the, that the perception that if I studied hard enough and I kept at it, I could do it too. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>You know. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, now that, that kinda leads us in an interesting direction, which is, in our earlier podcast, you talked some about the design work that you did at Radio Shack. You spent, you spent a good amount of time working for Tandy, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Right? Yeah. I, I started off there as a co-op, which I think people call now interns. Right. But interns, me means intern to me means a free co-op. I mean, I was actually paid not very much my minimum wage, but I was actually paid, while I was working. And it was, that was a program that I did with my undergraduate school, Texas a and m that I didn't actually have to interview for the job. They just simply said, go to this address at this time, and there's a job for you there. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Okay. So it took all the pressure off. Right. And, so I started there as a co-op, and then after I graduated, I worked one year for Data General and often building mini computers. Then they moved that group back to Boston and left me high and dry. And I just picked up the phone, called my old boss at Tandy, said, I just got laid off. Can I come work back at Tandy? And <span style="color:red" data-ts="4083.16" data-end_ts="4083.24" title="4083.16" id=c_"4083.16">__he__</span> said, sure. That was it. I got in my car and drove up to Fort Worth and started working the next day. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Wow. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>So, so I'm thankful that I co-opt <span style="color:red" data-ts="4092.72" data-end_ts="4092.8" title="4092.72" id=c_"4092.72">__at__</span> Tandy and I worked, so I co-opt three times there, and then I worked there for four years from 80 to 84. And then I worked there for five years from about 91 to 96, roughly 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Somewhere 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Around there Right. When a s t bought <span style="color:red" data-ts="4112.96" data-end_ts="4113.28" title="4112.96" id=c_"4112.96">__candy__</span> and got rid of, got, got rid of Radio Shack, you know, 'cause it, 'cause to be technical, I didn't work for Radio Shack, I worked for Tandy. So, so Tandy was the electronic side. Radio Shack was the retail store side. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, I see. Okay. That's how that works. Got it. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Yeah. See, and and Tandy, even though they were a, a prime vendor to Radio Shack, there's two things <span style="color:red" data-ts="4135.72" data-end_ts="4135.92" title="4135.72" id=c_"4135.72">__to__</span> remember about <span style="color:red" data-ts="4136.46" data-end_ts="4136.68" title="4136.46" id=c_"4136.46">__Pan__</span>. You know, we weren't the only vendor to Radio Shack. I mean, the VCRs were from ap. They sold Sony car stereos, you know, they were branded realistic, but they were made by Sony mm-hmm. <affirmative> and Panasonic and stuff. So you go into a <span style="color:red" data-ts="4152.86" data-end_ts="4153.08" title="4152.86" id=c_"4152.86">__EKS__</span> store, it may be 80% candy and 20%, you know, private branded other stuff. Right. Okay. On the other hand, candy had a factory in Korea and also a telephone factory in Hong Kong. And we made products for people besides Radio Shack. We made Alpine Car stereo. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Really? I didn't know that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Well, <span style="color:red" data-ts="4179.71" data-end_ts="4179.91" title="4179.71" id=c_"4179.71">__it__</span>, it's not something that's well known. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Clearly, obviously <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>But, but we were, well, we now call an O V M or a cmm. Okay. Right, right. We would take bids, people would say, we had this thing to build, and they would send it to 50 different companies we would all bid on with a low bid or whatever. We, we would get the business 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And stuff like that. And so it was very a fast paced environment. It was, we didn't have team. Okay. I don't understand to this day about we're gonna have a team, we're gonna have a meeting, and we're gonna have, you know, a team leader that <span style="color:red" data-ts="4217.55" data-end_ts="4217.87" title="4217.55" id=c_"4217.55">__candy__</span> was, you're going to design this computer and you have six months to do it. Go. It was one person, one job. Wow. Period. They didn't care what it was. It was one person, one job. Or from the later times, some of the bigger computers, they would say, have two people on it. Okay. And the, the biggest project that came <span style="color:red" data-ts="4239.75" data-end_ts="4239.95" title="4239.75" id=c_"4239.75">__out__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="4239.95" data-end_ts="4240.03" title="4239.95" id=c_"4239.95">__was__</span> ever on was attendee 2000 computer that had three people on it. Okay. <laugh>. And so, but we all did something completely different that we didn't have to talk to each other, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Basically. No. Nobody would even be able to imagine that these days. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Yeah. Oh, and, and of course we had no equipment. I mean, the, <laugh>, the choke <span style="color:red" data-ts="4257.79" data-end_ts="4257.99" title="4257.79" id=c_"4257.79">__and__</span> candy was, we all had a T-shirt that said, okay, he took my snow probe. The, the management was unprepared to forecast, a capital budget that was needed to design this stuff, especially when the computers started kicking in. Remember when I started at Tandy, computers were just starting. Right. They weren't a big runner. The biggest runner we had was cordless phones. Tandy was number one in the world and, you know, 47 mm-hmm. <affirmative> megahertz, cordless phones, number one in the world. And we sold like a hundred million dollars a year in 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="4291.98" data-end_ts="4292.4" title="4291.98" id=c_"4291.98">__Cordan__</span>. Oh my goodness. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>We sold like $80 million a year in answer machines. Remember answer machines <span style="color:red" data-ts="4298" data-end_ts="4298.24" title="4298" id=c_"4298">__that__</span> had cassettes in them. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And yes, I do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>For everybody under 30, there's a thing called a cassette that had tape on it that <span style="color:red" data-ts="4305.54" data-end_ts="4305.76" title="4305.54" id=c_"4305.54">__you__</span> could talk on and records stuff. And so Candy was number one in the world in answering machines. Okay. That was a big deal. Computers were new, but the management didn't understand that computers required a lot of expensive equipment, logic analyzers and all this stuff. And they were thinking that you could design a computer in the same environment as it's a a $49 answering machine 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Right. Right. And, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And it took many, many years. And some can argue it never, they never wrap their head around the fact that it's a different kind of an environment and <span style="color:red" data-ts="4344.7" data-end_ts="4344.92" title="4344.7" id=c_"4344.7">__the__</span> expectation level. You can't expect one poor guy to design the whole computer. You know, you can design a volt meter by yourself, but you can, it's hard to design a computer by yourself. Right. So we were woefully, woefully understaffed, and we were woefully under budgeted in terms of the equipment that we had to do it. It's a miracle. It's almost like the special, it's a miracle. <span style="color:red" data-ts="4368.38" data-end_ts="4368.6" title="4368.38" id=c_"4368.38">__The__</span> spa shuttle doesn't blow up every time you send it off. And this is like, it's like a miracle that Tan was able, in spite of that, successfully go as long as they could. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I remember the model 100, there was a time where practically anybody that was writing on the go was using a Model 100. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Okay. So the model 100 is the, an is is an answer to a trivia question. 
</p>

<p>

<b>Paul: </b>A model 100.

<p>

<p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sold, get your, you would get your one battery a month if you were on the Battery Club. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Well, that's because it had six in there. Right. I mean, radio Shack loved that kind of product because they would say that because we sold 50,000 model one hundreds. Consequently, we sold half a million batteries, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>You know, I mean, and people make <span style="color:red" data-ts="4527.09" data-end_ts="4527.29" title="4527.09" id=c_"4527.09">__funny__</span> Radio Shack batteries. Okay. The battery division of Radio Shack by itself with a $60 million company that had 70 points of gross margin. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Wow. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>If you know what points of gross margin is, Google it and figure out that means to basically multiply times five. Mm-hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Okay. And their batteries were still the best in the industry. Okay. They, they Consumer reports would try to find a reason to poo <span style="color:red" data-ts="4557.39" data-end_ts="4557.55" title="4557.39" id=c_"4557.39">__poo__</span> Radio Shack batteries, and they just kick tail everywhere. Right. And, and so Radio Shack, even though it was like a, a joke in the industry, they were laughing to the bank. There were people in million dollar houses because of Radio Shack batteries. Yeah. Okay. There were companies who came and went who could only wish they could sell like Radio Shack batteries. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, so how do you feel now about Radio Shack kind of on its way through the exit door? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>I feel sad because in a way, you know, I, I met my wife at Radio Shack. She was a tech rider on the Model three and the Model four. So it's people out there who have a Model three, <span style="color:red" data-ts="4594.83" data-end_ts="4594.99" title="4594.83" id=c_"4594.83">__or__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="4595.13" data-end_ts="4595.35" title="4595.13" id=c_"4595.13">__at__</span> their dad's probably have a Model three model <span style="color:red" data-ts="4597.34" data-end_ts="4597.83" title="4597.34" id=c_"4597.34">__theater__</span> on <span style="color:red" data-ts="4598.67" data-end_ts="4598.79" title="4598.67" id=c_"4598.67">__the__</span> grandfathers. Right. Then my, my wife had all the manuals for those because it was a Fort Worth institution at, at, at their peak, which was probably 1986, I think it was the peak of Radio Shack. It was 1986. That's when they were like a $4 billion company back then. Okay. They had like 25,000 employees in Fort Worth, 17 factories. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>My goodness. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>I mean, radio Shack, if you went to Radio Shack and you bought some antenna wire, is that, let's say you went to Radio Shack and you bought a, a TV antenna. For those of you who were young, you could get signals over the air with a thing called 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>That was real ugly. You had to stick on your chimney or your roof. But if you went to Radio Shack, you bought an antenna and you bought the wire for it, the antenna and the wire were made in two factories in Fort Worth. Okay. Radio Shack pulled their own wire. Copper OTs went in one end and the wire came out the other end. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>They did not every, every wire in every Radio Shack product was made by Radio Shack. We built our own TV antennas. I mean, metal went in one side, they had these big giant bats of platting materials, and anodizing and antennas came out the other side. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>It's very, very huge economic driver for the city of Fort Worth. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Now it's completely gone. I mean, it's, it's kind of sad. I mean, radio Shack had these two beautiful buildings downtown, and they built a technology center, in between them <span style="color:red" data-ts="4697.17" data-end_ts="4697.46" title="4697.17" id=c_"4697.17">__that__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="4697.46" data-end_ts="4697.62" title="4697.46" id=c_"4697.46">__once__</span> they had an ice rink and a shopping mall in the buildings, they had a Borders bookstore. Okay. Where people used to read books. <laugh>. I mean, it was a, it was a whole community. I mean, you could go to work and, and eat lunch and go ice skating and, and they had a <span style="color:red" data-ts="4714.62" data-end_ts="4714.94" title="4714.62" id=c_"4714.62">__Dillard__</span> department store. You could still buy your, your work clothes and go home. It was, it was great. Also, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="4720.82" data-end_ts="4721.1" title="4720.82" id=c_"4720.82">__won't__</span> deny the fact that Tammy was in one tower and Radio Shack was in the other. But if you look at the employees in these two towers, at the time in the eighties, it was about 90% female. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And for a single guy in the eighties, working in the company that was 90% female was pretty exciting at the time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And like I said, that's where I met my wife. Right. And so we both, we both missed S shack. It was a family thing. It was a huge softball tournament. <span style="color:red" data-ts="4755" data-end_ts="4755.22" title="4755" id=c_"4755">__It__</span> was <span style="color:red" data-ts="4755.38" data-end_ts="4755.54" title="4755.38" id=c_"4755.38">__the__</span>, the, the, the, the peak of the Tandy social calendar with this massive, it was like the final four. There were like 64 teams playing softball. And it was like these marathon weekends and sometimes alcohol was a factor. But 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>It was a great time. And I really <span style="color:red" data-ts="4776.18" data-end_ts="4776.42" title="4776.18" id=c_"4776.18">__missed__</span> those days. I think that it <span style="color:red" data-ts="4780.06" data-end_ts="4780.22" title="4780.06" id=c_"4780.06">__was__</span> inevitable that Radio Shack never really found their footing after about 2002, 2003. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And again, I'm surprised they lasted this long. I mean, it's just the fact that pe people don't tinker and the fact that electronics is devalued. Yeah. Remember when I was growing up, think about this when I was growing up, why was there even a heath kit? Why, <span style="color:red" data-ts="4810.18" data-end_ts="4810.4" title="4810.18" id=c_"4810.18">__why__</span>, how could heath kit even have a retail store? Because if you wanted something really good electronics, it was actually cheaper to build it yourself. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Plus there was <span style="color:red" data-ts="4821.2" data-end_ts="4821.44" title="4821.2" id=c_"4821.2">__this__</span> sort of Asian bias at the time of the sixties that, oh, if it's from overseas, it's garbage. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Okay. You know, you know, rah <span style="color:red" data-ts="4831.28" data-end_ts="4831.36" title="4831.28" id=c_"4831.28">__rah__</span>, u s a, whatever. And there was some truth to that. Okay. But now there is no foreign bias. Okay. 'cause everything's made overseas anyway. Okay. So if you want it, it's gonna come from China, whether you like it or not. And people think everything should cost a hundred dollars no matter what. It's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="4852.67" data-end_ts="4853.16" title="4852.67" id=c_"4852.67">__Alright__</span>. I mean, when I was working on, one of the things I worked on at Tandy was we designed our own CD players, and we actually designed our own basic chips in the CD players. Partly for money, partly for patent reasons. But I did a lot of research one year on how to read data off of a CD disc, both CD <span style="color:red" data-ts="4878.52" data-end_ts="4878.6" title="4878.52" id=c_"4878.52">__ro__</span> and I was stunned about how complicated it's, of course, all that's hidden from most people. They pick up a CD and they shove it and then expect it to work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Okay. But it's a huge amount of technology behind that, that people don't value it. They think that a cd, you know, or now of course it's the D V D. So if you go to a company like Nubank and say, I'm want a D v d Blu-ray burner for my computer, and it's not $19, you go, poof. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And I'm thinking, do you have any idea what's in there, the idea what's going on? And the answer is double. We don't care because we don't value that anymore. I mean, I grew up in a, in an era in the sixties and the seventies where electronics were still mysterious. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. And 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>People, and people, people were in awe <span style="color:red" data-ts="4929.88" data-end_ts="4929.92" title="4929.88" id=c_"4929.88">__of__</span> the electronics. Okay. I'm sure I could go today to any college in America, into their electrical engineering department and say, I have a thousand dollars. If you can tell me how broadcast color TV works. <span style="color:red" data-ts="4948.96" data-end_ts="4949.25" title="4948.96" id=c_"4948.96">__They__</span> walk up to the whiteboard and say, from the camera to a color TV over the air, basically, what is going on? They would have no idea. Okay. Because it's not <span style="color:red" data-ts="4962.14" data-end_ts="4962.5" title="4962.14" id=c_"4962.14">__valued__</span>. It's like, well, I don't know, it's some kind of impact. I go, no, no, no, no, no. It's not that. <span style="color:red" data-ts="4969.92" data-end_ts="4970.14" title="4969.92" id=c_"4969.92">__And__</span>, and it's like, well, other people do it. Right. So we're in a society now where the mysterious others, I call it the others do it. Okay. I mean, we grew, most of our parents and my grandparents grew up in a, in a, in a farming kind of culture. Right. Everyone had a garden. Everybody grew stuff. Yep. <span style="color:red" data-ts="4990.29" data-end_ts="4990.64" title="4990.29" id=c_"4990.29">__Asked__</span>, asked <span style="color:red" data-ts="4991.3" data-end_ts="4991.52" title="4991.3" id=c_"4991.3">__at__</span> high school student today, where do carrots come from? I mean, where they grow in the ground, above the ground on a vine, on a tree, a carrot. What some of them would <span style="color:red" data-ts="5006.16" data-end_ts="5006.28" title="5006.16" id=c_"5006.16">__probably__</span>, they wouldn't have any idea, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You know, at this point, I'm not sure that any of 'em would know what the actual shape of a carrot is, because they just get 'em in the, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Like it comes in a little bag and it's, it's, it's in my Thai food. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Right. Exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>But I'm saying is because the mysterious others do that. Okay. <span style="color:red" data-ts="5022.28" data-end_ts="5022.52" title="5022.28" id=c_"5022.28">__Right__</span>, right. You go to the stores and they're, and it's all laid out for you. You don't have to think about it. And that's, that's what I, I am, I'm kind of despondent because I grew up with electronics being the most magical, but real thing you could possibly think of. And that's even tied into the space program. Like, yeah. Can you believe we're walking on the moon? Although some people don't. But, you know, <laugh>, and then we come to today where I'm just thankful that at least <span style="color:red" data-ts="5053.07" data-end_ts="5053.36" title="5053.07" id=c_"5053.07">__URAC__</span> modules aren't devalued, that people haven't decided every year <span style="color:red" data-ts="5056.86" data-end_ts="5057.08" title="5056.86" id=c_"5056.86">__rec__</span> module should be $29. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Of course. Now there is talk at namm, you know, the big buzz at NAM <span style="color:red" data-ts="5063.72" data-end_ts="5063.84" title="5063.72" id=c_"5063.72">__is__</span> that some of the bigger players are gonna get into <span style="color:red" data-ts="5065.84" data-end_ts="5066.04" title="5065.84" id=c_"5065.84">__your__</span> Iraq and <span style="color:red" data-ts="5067.16" data-end_ts="5067.32" title="5067.16" id=c_"5067.16">__may__</span> be going to that, I don't know. But at least for right now, I am happy that in my little world of modulars, it's still valued, but it's hard to find anything else. Is there, I mean, people will value my three 50 V C o more than they value smartphone. Right. Even <span style="color:red" data-ts="5087.32" data-end_ts="5087.44" title="5087.32" id=c_"5087.32">__though__</span> smartphone's got 3000 times more technology in it than my <span style="color:red" data-ts="5092.24" data-end_ts="5092.36" title="5092.24" id=c_"5092.24">__D__</span> three 50, it's sells for twice as much as <span style="color:red" data-ts="5096.24" data-end_ts="5096.36" title="5096.24" id=c_"5096.24">__a__</span> smartphone.

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well,

<b>Paul: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="5098.48" data-end_ts="5098.88" title="5098.48" id=c_"5098.48">__Because__</span> it still has some value to it. So I'm thankful for that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, yeah. True enough. I mean, so, so what is, where, how do, how do we get people involved in, enjoying unraveling the mysteries of electronics? Again? I mean, the maker movement is trying, you know, there are different, different groups that seem to be oriented towards getting people re-involved in the creation of stuff. Do you think that's gonna get traction? Or do you think there's another thing that could happen? Or do you think it's a lost cause? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>I don't know. I I'm, I'm, I'm <span style="color:red" data-ts="5140.02" data-end_ts="5140.24" title="5140.02" id=c_"5140.02">__sn__</span> about the, I'm, I'm still on the fence about the whole three D printing thing.

Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Okay. And whereas people are gonna sit there and complain about the color of this isn't exactly right. Or I can't get this resolution of the nozzle or the stupid strings cost too much, or, and I'm like, shut up. You've got this thing on your desk that does all this stuff and you're bitching about the constant string and the color <span style="color:red" data-ts="5171.7" data-end_ts="5171.92" title="5171.7" id=c_"5171.7">__is__</span> not, it's not the right yellow. Right. You know, and, but that's again, part of, I think, you know, I have a 22 year old son and a 29 year old daughter that grew up on the fact that everything is Star Trek. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>I mean, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>I can remember in high school in the seventies, <span style="color:red" data-ts="5195.94" data-end_ts="5196.16" title="5195.94" id=c_"5195.94">__it__</span> was a very influential magazine called Popular Electronics. That was a very big d i y, you know, build this stuff every month kind of stuff. I read every issue 50 times. And they would always say, will there ever be a flat tv? And they were, and they had scientists arguing about it's impossible to make a flat tv. Or you can't make one any thicker, you know, any thinner than four inches because of the electron beams. Because they didn't even know about T f t transistors. Okay. They were thinking electron beams. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And they were Right.

I mean, I grew up, you know, building computers. I don't know, I mean, how many people today who aren't avid gamers, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Build their own, build their own computer thinking I can save some money if I buy this <span style="color:red" data-ts="5283.48" data-end_ts="5283.68" title="5283.48" id=c_"5283.48">__on__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="5283.68" data-end_ts="5283.8" title="5283.68" id=c_"5283.68">__the__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="5283.8" data-end_ts="5283.96" title="5283.8" id=c_"5283.8">__board__</span> and do this and learn.

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The culture. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>But, but people who aren't gaming because, and that's gonna end because the new Nvidia cards are so fast, no matter what you build, it's going to, you know, it's not gonna matter. Is that people are interested in the, the end result now end. Okay. They don't care how Facebook works, but they're happy there's Facebook. Right. They don't care how Twitter is set up or how it's even done. Or even how you, how can you take the picture and compress it and send it the mysterious others do it. Right. It's the others. And it's gone from the farming others to the electronic, others to now the coating others. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>You know, to the, to the maker others. You know, I mean, 'cause I think what's gonna happen in the, in the make, in the make, let's talk about three D kind of stuff, is that people are gonna be interested in the end result, which is, I want an application on my phone that I can draw my own, like I <span style="color:red" data-ts="5353.4" data-end_ts="5353.52" title="5353.4" id=c_"5353.4">__can__</span> license all the Marvell comic library, and so I can make my own Ironman and push a button <span style="color:red" data-ts="5358.76" data-end_ts="5358.96" title="5358.76" id=c_"5358.76">__in__</span> an over Bluetooth.

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. And that's how, that's how get toys now. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>They don't, they don't, the fact that you can even do that isn't impressive because in their world they've always been able to do it. It's, it's kind of like, you know, I've always grew up loving antiques and going to antique stores and things like that. And I'm seeing now where I don't think by the year 2030 there's gonna be an antique store in America, because the people who are, who are now, they're like, why do I want in an old creepy old bed 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>I'll just go to Ikea and buy that pretty one over there, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Because they don't care about the history. Like, well, because the Ikea new bed used to be this old weird bed over here. And they go, well, I don't want that weird bed anymore. I just want the, the, the latest and greatest thing. And, and so it's, it's a hard question. I'm glad that there's the cord, little bits that are out there. Right. I wish I invented it, you know? Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="5423.56" data-end_ts="5423.8" title="5423.56" id=c_"5423.56">__Save__</span> on me for not thinking that up. But I think that's just a small number of people.

<p>

</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>I'm gonna keep my head down and, and, and when it implodes, it's gonna implode and, and,

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And hopefully it implodes on someone else. Right.

</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, you know? Right. Right on. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>That's, that's my only worry because, it, it's, <span style="color:red" data-ts="5478.62" data-end_ts="5478.84" title="5478.62" id=c_"5478.62">__it__</span>, if you get caught on those wrong cycles, I mean, like right now I'm sitting here looking at $23,000 of bills I have to pay this month mm-hmm. <affirmative> for parts <span style="color:red" data-ts="5488.51" data-end_ts="5488.8" title="5488.51" id=c_"5488.51">__that__</span> are, that, that, that are sitting in boxes for a module that I haven't even gotten to production yet. 
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>You know, so it's a vicious cycle of cash flow. And I think, that's gonna, that eventually, if the death of a lot of people who get into this business thinking it's great, and then you get to a certain level that you dream about, and then all of a sudden you're <span style="color:red" data-ts="5514.19" data-end_ts="5514.31" title="5514.19" id=c_"5514.19">__buying__</span> these 10,000 <span style="color:red" data-ts="5515.11" data-end_ts="5515.31" title="5515.11" id=c_"5515.11">__bucks__</span> checks all the time.

You know, it kind of kind of exploded. And so it's, it's, it's, it's tough to get people, you know, people ask me, why don't you go back full circle? Why don't you come out with some boards again? You know, don't, you know, people, you know, 15 years have passed, so everyone knows about <span style="color:red" data-ts="5539.63" data-end_ts="5539.92" title="5539.63" id=c_"5539.63">__MA's__</span> from DigiKey <span style="color:red" data-ts="5540.44" data-end_ts="5540.64" title="5540.44" id=c_"5540.44">__and__</span> mm-hmm. <affirmative>, you don't have to count, <span style="color:red" data-ts="5542.37" data-end_ts="5542.72" title="5542.37" id=c_"5542.37">__count__</span> anymore, but people still like the solder. And you can get boards a lot cheaper now, and the boards are higher quality. And I don't know, I might, you know, we will see, you know, because I, I, I'm hoping to retire. I'm officially, you know, less than seven years from retirement age according to my wife, <laugh>. So I've always, I'm always looking for something to tinker with. I'm, I'm a hopeless tinker, you know, and that, I think that's something that you're kind of born with that you always think stuff is cool. I mean, why else would I subscribe to a group that takes pictures of the electronic <span style="color:red" data-ts="5581" data-end_ts="5581.28" title="5581" id=c_"5581">__services__</span>? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>I mean, because I still think they're cool and maybe eventually through the modular stuff, it'll slowly grow and people will come back and say, you know, this electronic stuff, it's pretty cool. You know, that's what I'm thinking. I don't think people think D v D players are cool. Laptops are cool, or even their cell phones are cool. Really. I mean, their, their fans, I mean, they'll argue for hours and hours about Apple versus Android, but I don't see any arguments arguing over, you know, megahertz and gigahertz and pixels and, you know, d s p voice compression algorithms. Right. It's more of a corporate arguing rather than a feature arguing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="5632.11" data-end_ts="5632.33" title="5632.11" id=c_"5632.11">__Now__</span> people don't even argue that much in Eurorack, really, which is surprising.

It, it, it seems to be fairly, even tempered. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. This is true. Well, I think, I think some of that is just the nature of how the, how that community kind of re-emerged from, you know, the, from the oohs. You know, you have to kinda give Mike McGrath, some credit for putting together a community in the muff wiggler world that sort of was like a great new place to reintroduce some of this stuff, so 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Right. Because again, it's, it's new if you've never seen them before. Right. But <span style="color:red" data-ts="5688.17" data-end_ts="5688.33" title="5688.17" id=c_"5688.17">__yeah__</span>. But you have people like me who's been around it since the sixties versus people who just discovered it yesterday 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Okay. And that's very rare in the musical world. Right. You don't have people who say, what is this electric guitar that you speak of? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>You know, I mean, but you still have that modular. Yeah, you <span style="color:red" data-ts="5710.24" data-end_ts="5710.36" title="5710.24" id=c_"5710.24">__do__</span>.

</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, what's interesting to me actually is that people have a desire to get into modulars, and they're asking questions like, what is a V C A? And you're sort of like, man, how did you even get into this? And then you realize that, you know, there's a certain amount of fashion involved too, I guess so. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Yeah. You know what's interesting is, a control voltage in Poland, Oregon, that's a retail <span style="color:red" data-ts="5742.61" data-end_ts="5742.96" title="5742.61" id=c_"5742.61">__store__</span>, right. You know, they have like once a month, they have like a, you know, come into the store on a Saturday and we will give a little, you know, modular 1 0 1 lecture and it's thrown over to like 150 people show up. Yeah. You know, so it's, it's, it's pretty amazing. I mean, I went to control <span style="color:red" data-ts="5765.98" data-end_ts="5766.2" title="5765.98" id=c_"5765.98">__in__</span> New York City mm-hmm. <affirmative> and talked about some of my upcoming modules and stuff, and it's a <span style="color:red" data-ts="5774.16" data-end_ts="5774.32" title="5774.16" id=c_"5774.16">__pretty__</span>, pretty small store, but it was, it was packed full of people.

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Indeed. So hopefully 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>It'll, hopefully it'll keep going.

<p>

</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>One, one of, one of the things that's interesting is that, you know, there's only so much you can do with amps and transistors, and now you start going to D S P, but then eventually everybody's gonna start sticking raspberry <span style="color:red" data-ts="5820.8" data-end_ts="5821.02" title="5820.8" id=c_"5820.8">__pi__</span> twos behind panels, and then what do you do?

</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Indeed. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And so we can't all be running max m p on every single thing, so, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Wow. It's, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>It's gonna be interesting to see if people can delineate not only in the lower analog modules, but in the digital modules as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. That 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>It just doesn't reduce to, I stuck this intel I seven, xenon 16 processor behind the panel, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Although it seems like it, it is racing that direction and, but 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>I don't dunno if that's a good direction to race to. Okay. I'm not 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Sure. You either. I agree. When, 
</p>

<p>

But again, when I get a chance to talk to Paul, I don't want to hang up the phone too quickly, so it was a pretty amazing discussion. Thanks for listening. Thanks for telling your friends. Tell some more of your friends. It's all great, <laugh>. I just love to make sure that, people are listening to this and beyond that. I will catch you next week. Thanks a.
