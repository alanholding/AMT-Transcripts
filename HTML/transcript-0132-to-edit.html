<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today I have the great pleasure of getting a chance to talk to someone that, whose work I've been following for a long time. I actually met her completely anonymous guy style at a ES one year where she was doing demos. And, I got a hands-on demo. I I was, that was a highlight of that year. Her name is Carlos <span style="color:red" data-ts="33.985" data-end_ts="34.205" title="33.985" id=c_"33.985">__Ti__</span> She is one of the big brains behind symbolic sound, the maker of the chemo system, and one of the people that is involved in making stuff for extreme sound design. I think that that's a pretty good introduction. Carla, why don't, first of all let me say hi. Hi, how are you? Hi, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla Scaletti: </b>Thanks Darwin I, I like that extreme sound design 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, right? Well, I say that because the people I know that are dedicated <span style="color:red" data-ts="62.365" data-end_ts="62.605" title="62.365" id=c_"62.365">__team__</span> users are into it to the extreme. They identify themselves as sound designers and they focus on doing things that most people consider sort of impossible. And so, and so they feel like your systems allow them to do that. And so, you know, from that standpoint, it's, that's a, that's high praise coming from the users of your system. So why don't we start off by having you explain a little bit about what your current work is, the, the things that you're doing at symbolic 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>In general. We make, software for sound design software and hardware for sound design. I am working on software development. I'm working on the next version of KEA and working on user support. I mean, we spend some time every day doing user support and we spend some time shipping hardware systems to various places in the world. And we, we're also preparing for the <span style="color:red" data-ts="121.385" data-end_ts="121.605" title="121.385" id=c_"121.385">__KEA__</span> International Sound Symposium that we call kiss. And that's gonna be in Leicester in the UK on September 7th. We're really getting, excited about that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>One of the things that, that made me want to kind of interview you now is I was talking to Meg <span style="color:red" data-ts="138.565" data-end_ts="138.965" title="138.565" id=c_"138.565">__Schelle__</span> and she said that you're going to be interacting with them down in Stony Brook a little bit, but also she pointed to me that you had recently, you had done the keynote at the last ICMC. You've been kind of really active lately, which is kind of cool. 'cause I think a lot of times you're kind of deep <span style="color:red" data-ts="157.165" data-end_ts="157.365" title="157.165" id=c_"157.165">__in__</span> the laboratory, right? And so it's, it's good to, it's good to see you getting out and, and interacting with folks. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>I mean we, we've been active and it's just maybe more visible because, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Yeah. Yeah. I think just because of this confluence of events, right? So now you are in a really interesting spot, which is that chemo system is really a system in that it is kind of an integration of software and hardware, which is kind of peculiar, but in a way probably offers some really, some really great options because you kind of control the entire environment, right? But I think for a lot of people there will be almost, well, I think five years ago it probably would've been worse in terms of people not really understanding why does there have to be a hardware component? There's been kind of a resurgence in excitement over hardware lately, but you have always really had strong feelings about having both a hardware and a software component that create the system. Can you, can you explain a little bit why that is? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>Well, you know, Alan Kay, you, you saw that article, so you know that this quote from Alan Kay who said that people who are really serious about software should make their own hardware. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And the reason for that is all software runs on hardware. You know, you can, if, but if you have a hand in designing a hardware, you can fine tune it to the software. I mean, you, you're always gonna be running your software on hardware. But it could be this generic hardware that was designed for the mass market, or it could be hardware that was fine tuned specifically to match the architecture of your software. I mean, in Apple itself, that's why they designed their own hardware, right? They've even gone so far as to design their own arm processor to ensure that the iOS runs really well for on iPads and, and iPhones. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure, yeah. So the, the article that you mentioned, and I'm just gonna say this for the listeners, it was the cover article for the spring 2016 edition of the Computer Music Journal. It was, was it a transcript of your ICMC speech? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>Yes. <span style="color:red" data-ts="292.075" data-end_ts="292.365" title="292.075" id=c_"292.075">__Well__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And then, and it included some pictures, which were pretty fascinating histories. So I'm curious, the, the story that that article weaves is one of basically you getting to see one leg of the computer music world develop and then sadly kind of get thrown asunder and sort of rebuild itself through the will of the people involved. Right? I I think that's framing it kind of in a useful way. It was, talking about the Platypus system. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>Oh 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. It's really interesting because the way that you talk about developing work for that system, it sounds like nothing we actually experienced in that you were doing microcode, which I'm not even sure I know what microcode is. It was on this very specific hardware. And then when you were no longer able to work with that system, you basically started, I think, symbolic <span style="color:red" data-ts="350.585" data-end_ts="350.805" title="350.585" id=c_"350.585">__san__</span> to sort of like, provide similar functionality. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>I was able to continue using the platypus. Oh, you were? 'cause we had, built our own platypus. Oh, okay. We bought all the parts and wired up, did all the wire wrapping and built our own platypus <laugh>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="367.065" data-end_ts="367.285" title="367.065" id=c_"367.065">__We__</span> still have, <laugh>, but in order to, that was not a practical solution for building multiple ones and shipping to other people. 'cause it was a very fine tuned <laugh> process of wire wrapping. So in order to make something that was more, mass producible, we went to the DSP chips. But because the DSP chips at that time were only half the speed of a platypus, that's why Kurt decided to go with Multiprocessor. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. And when I was first introduced to the system, again, it was, I ran across it at an a ES and you were there doing some demos and I was kind of floored by what I saw, but I was also floored by, at the time, you know, there was this very large rack-mounted box that had, you know, multiple processor cards. And just the idea of a multi-processing system at the time was a little bit mind boggling. I mean, it was, that was definitely not the common approach and certainly not among like, general use computers. I mean, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>And now it is 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And now it is, right. But at the time, nobody had seen anything like that, ever. And so it seems like there had to be an awful lot of invention that occurred just to make it work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>Well, this is where I should pull Kurt into the conversation here, but, yeah, he figured out his own bus and his own way of connecting. And I mean the, the DSPs could have been interconnected in any configuration, right? He modeled it after the <span style="color:red" data-ts="472.215" data-end_ts="472.565" title="472.215" id=c_"472.215">__chemo__</span> sound structure, which was in the shape of a dag, like a directed graph, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>'cause of that, he connected them one in kind of a straight line, one to the next, to the next. Sure. So you could compute part of the signal on one, and then when that signal could go on to the next processor, to the next processor. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So instead of having to come up with some general purpose scheme, <span style="color:red" data-ts="495.525" data-end_ts="495.805" title="495.525" id=c_"495.525">__what__</span> you actually did is say, here's the, here's the problem we're trying to solve, and here's a architecture that helps us solve that efficiently. That is, you know, sort of one of the explanations of why do, why do function specific hardware is because you don't have to make the compromises necessary to do general work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>Right. Well, it is still, I, you know, I wanna say that it's general purpose. It's not that it's, specific function specific in the sense of an old digital sense where there's one section that's an oscillator Oh, right. Section that's an amplifier. No, no, no. It is, you know, it is very basic. Like a platypus was a multiply accumulator, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Uhhuh <affirmative>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>And it's the software that makes it into all these other machines. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see, I see. I get it. Very interesting. Yeah. But I mean, still you don't have to worry about like, you know, how do you, how do you play the latest version of Doom or whatever. So <laugh> so true. It's true. But, <span style="color:red" data-ts="560.065" data-end_ts="560.285" title="560.065" id=c_"560.065">__you__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>Don't have to do, you don't have to have this really heavy operating system. You can just dedicate all of the cycles you have to <span style="color:red" data-ts="566.405" data-end_ts="566.565" title="566.405" id=c_"566.405">__making__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="566.615" data-end_ts="566.965" title="566.615" id=c_"566.615">__sound__</span>. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So one of the things I'm curious about, because it's not something you cover in the paper, is your personal journey to get to the point where you were doing compositions and pieces, by writing micro code for the platypus. Right. People don't go to grade school hoping to write micro code. So I'm curious, how did you get started? You know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="593.345" data-end_ts="593.565" title="593.345" id=c_"593.345">__how__</span>, what was your both technical and sort of like musical growth because something had to happen kind of simultaneous there in order to put you in a position to feel comfortable in a studio doing, doing computer music and, and actually performing pieces as well as doing the technical work. I think that that's a really interesting combination thing. And I'm curious to know where you came from. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>Well, I think, in high school I was interested in science and in music that I was passionate about both of those things. And actually it wasn't really until I, you know, the moment that I started college that I decided to go <span style="color:red" data-ts="637.585" data-end_ts="637.805" title="637.585" id=c_"637.585">__for__</span> music in high school. I had this, idea that I had this strong sense that there were patterns that, that the patterns that you see all around you in nature were traces left by some process. I also had the sense that we were meant to try to understand and notice those patterns and try to understand them. <span style="color:red" data-ts="659.705" data-end_ts="659.925" title="659.705" id=c_"659.705">__And__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="659.925" data-end_ts="660.165" title="659.925" id=c_"659.925">__then__</span>, and since I was a musician, I decided that what I should do is try to reflect those patterns and sound. And so that was what I think led me into data sonification and in, and the kind of music that I do was trying to reflect those patterns. I still do try to do that 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Pattern stuff is something that I hear a lot of times when, when, like visual artists talk about their work. A lot of times patterns were a really important part of what they, what drew them in as well. But there's, there seems to be this thing where, as you say, our brains have a desire to find and categorize the patterns that they see. It seems like the computer's a pretty good tool to help at least storm 'em and recall 'em at some point. Yeah. What, what musical instrument did you play? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>Well, I played, I played piano and I played harp and I played violin. Oh, okay. In high school. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>The harp I continued for a while into college. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So what is it about computer music was at the time and what the harp was at the time were two very different things. <laugh>. What spoke to you about the computer music? Was it the cha the intellectualism of it, or was there a sonic element that you found attractive? Or was it the possibilities? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>If I'm honest with myself, I think there's a big element of science fiction that I love science fiction. So I knew that I was destined to be using computers and electronics to make sound. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, that's, that's an awesome answer. And you know what my suspicion is, a lot more people feel that way and are scared to say it because there's something about talking about science fiction that's like puts you in the land of like a different kind of dreamer or something. I don't know. I was a huge science fiction person, when I was in high school. And in a way, science fiction actually set you up really nicely <span style="color:red" data-ts="782.545" data-end_ts="782.765" title="782.545" id=c_"782.545">__for__</span> what, for what the world became, you know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>In a way it's very much like composition, right? Because it's like setting up this hypothetical universe and then saying, okay, let's just take it to the, let's just work it all the way out and say, if we started with this different premise, what would be the result? And I think <span style="color:red" data-ts="802.565" data-end_ts="802.725" title="802.565" id=c_"802.565">__of__</span> composition that way too. <span style="color:red" data-ts="804.385" data-end_ts="804.605" title="804.385" id=c_"804.385">__But__</span> you start with, okay, let's say we're going to make a piece of music and only use clicks, right? And let's work it all the way through to the end and see what happens. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well I think that that's actually the, the interesting difference between science fiction and futurism. 'cause futurism always is like, what is the most optimistically good thing that could happen? And so often science fiction starts off with like, well, the right booster fell off the spaceship and we're hurdling towards, alpha <span style="color:red" data-ts="836.425" data-end_ts="836.645" title="836.425" id=c_"836.425">__San__</span> Tori and what good could possibly happen, you know, <laugh>, it's a, it's, if nothing else, more interesting premises <span style="color:red" data-ts="844.865" data-end_ts="845.085" title="844.865" id=c_"844.865">__are__</span> starting points. Right. I wanna talk a little more though, about your decision to choose between music and technology, because, well, and I'm kind of curious about growing up what your motivations were, because realistically there are a lot of scenarios and in people that I've interviewed, a lot of scenarios where it's like parents out there saying, you know, if you're gonna go to college, why don't you have that great backup plan as an accountant? You know, and then you can go study that music thing and have, you know, or whatever. I mean, it's generally speaking, going to school and focusing on music is kind of, you have to feel really strongly about it to go that way with, you know, to, to make that decision. What, where were you at to make that kind of decision? Or was it a, or was it a, I don't know what I want to do. So I'm gonna start off here. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>Oh, no, no. I knew what I wanted to do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You knew what you wanted to do, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b><laugh>. But, yeah, I think, I actually might've been almost the opposite. 'cause that I, it was, I think it was my mother who told me that I could do that for my profession, because I always thought that I would do music and I was gonna do this, algorithmic composition, you know, reflecting the patterns. I knew I was gonna do that, but I thought that would be a hobby. And then, you know, my job would be researcher or do something else. Sure. And you know, we were just whatever, drawing the pots and pans after dinner or something and talking about it. And she said, why not? Why couldn't you do that as your profession? And I was <span style="color:red" data-ts="943.695" data-end_ts="944.045" title="943.695" id=c_"943.695">__thing__</span>, okay, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So practically everybody in the world right now wishes they had your mother as their mother. That's, that sounds pretty amazing because that's like a concrete version of you. My child can be anything. You want to be <laugh>. Right? But so often parents say that, and then the second you say, well, I want to be an astronaut, the parents will come back and say, yeah, but nobody's an astronaut. <laugh>. You know, <laugh>. But, you actually, your your mother said, no, why wouldn't you? I think that's amazing. It 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>Is. I haven't thought about that for a long time. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="983.765" data-end_ts="983.965" title="983.765" id=c_"983.765">__that__</span>, and it was amazing. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's really cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>Thanks mom. <laugh>. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>There you go. Thanks Carla's mom. <laugh>, we appreciate it. All of us. So that's, that's really fantastic. Now, you went to school and did you start off focusing on, you know, again, we, there's gonna be this constant weaving and and my questions are gonna kind of dance like this too. So this be this weaving of technology and music and technology and music. So you have these ideas of patterns and, and algorithmic concepts. How did you find your way through the moras? Because the morass of the technology as well as acceptance of that as a musical effort. Right. You know, so first of all, you had to somehow learn to code and you had to somehow get access to these machines and you had to somehow get to be part of these design groups and these, composer groups that had access to the machines. 'cause believe me, I kinda remember that, that timeframe a little bit myself and just sort of like running through the gauntlet necessary to be able to touch the machine was actually a pretty big ordeal. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>Right. It was, almost like this, people were almost in awe of these computers and they had Right, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Either in awe or just, just feared <span style="color:red" data-ts="1069.56" data-end_ts="1069.68" title="1069.56" id=c_"1069.56">__them__</span> one or the other. It was <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>Yeah. I remember, people having this, treating the technology, the computer. Right. A big thing. And one of the things I remember about when I first walked into the Sterile Sound Group, which is the group that made the Platypus, that's Lip <span style="color:red" data-ts="1089.435" data-end_ts="1089.725" title="1089.435" id=c_"1089.435">__Talk__</span>, and then <span style="color:red" data-ts="1090.395" data-end_ts="1090.685" title="1090.395" id=c_"1090.395">__TiVo__</span>. And they had made eventually the Platypus at that time it was called the Interactive Music System. When I walked into their lab, they were a group of undergraduate electrical engineers. So I walked in their lab and I saw that they had stickers all over their computers and, over their terminals. And they had, pet gerbils running around and a fish tank with <laugh> salt water fish, and all their, all their other gear and sports equipment was lying around. And I was like, I realized like, okay, these guys are comfortable with the computer. Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1126.225" data-end_ts="1126.445" title="1126.225" id=c_"1126.225">__And__</span> you just use it. You know, they were the first people I've met who, actually used it. They actually were able to use it to leverage to do the things they wanted to do. They weren't in awe of it, like this big special thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. That actually really reminds me of the, of, Levy's book Hackers. And so they just came out with a new version on like the audible.com books. And so I've been listening to it because that was a, that was a favorite book of mine when I was younger. You know, that was one of the things that I remember even in my original reading of it, was <span style="color:red" data-ts="1160.255" data-end_ts="1160.605" title="1160.255" id=c_"1160.255">__there__</span> this sense that they actually, in, in many ways the computer was very personal because it was like the computer room was practically like their dorm room. Right, right. Do, do you feel like you had to do anything to sort of like, prove that you belonged in the room? Like did you have to do a piece or did you have to cut some code or did you have to 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>I can just tell a couple of little stories about that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, that'd be great. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>So the way that I had heard about this group, they, they have something on the campus at the University of Illinois that's called Engineering Open House. Every spring it's just a big kind of a expo or all the undergraduates show these projects that they've been working on. And I hadn't even gone to it, but all my friends knew that I was <span style="color:red" data-ts="1206.045" data-end_ts="1206.445" title="1206.045" id=c_"1206.045">__really__</span> into this stuff. So they said, you should go look at this engineering open house 'cause they're printing music on the computer. Well, it is hard to imagine now. But that was a big deal. I mean, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1218.445" data-end_ts="1218.565" title="1218.445" id=c_"1218.445">__that__</span>, I had never seen that before. Of course now it's ubiquitous. But, so I went to see that demonstration 'cause I was working on a harp, a piece for Harp and Music 360 generated Tape Music 360 is like the predecessor of CSS Sound. Anyway, I wanted to write the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1237.765" data-end_ts="1237.925" title="1237.765" id=c_"1237.765">__hard__</span> part on the computer. I wanted to print it on the computer. I was tired of my, calligraphy pens, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b><laugh>. So I, so I, I went to see it and I discovered not only were they printing music that they had made a digital synthesizer and it could do FM a wave shaping and additive synthesis. It was more powerful than the digital synthesizer that they had at the School of Music, which was <span style="color:red" data-ts="1265.285" data-end_ts="1265.405" title="1265.285" id=c_"1265.285">__a__</span> FM <span style="color:red" data-ts="1265.945" data-end_ts="1266.365" title="1265.945" id=c_"1265.945">__single__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1266.395" data-end_ts="1266.685" title="1266.395" id=c_"1266.395">__beer__</span> at that time. Right. So anyway, I made an appointment to come over to use to learn how to use their system to print music. And Lip Hawkin is the person, he's behind the Continuum Fingerboard, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>So, but he was the head of this lab and we were all students, but we actually had a lab. So he was the one doing the music printing. So I made an appointment with him and I showed up at the appointment and it turned out that he was so nervous that someone from the School of Music would be really demanding and would want to make all kinds of changes and weird symbols and, extended notation. So at the last minute he bailed out and he asked Kurt to meet with me instead. And the rest is history. Yeah. So in a way yes. What I, I mean, maybe the proving myself thing was that they showed me the manual, for Opal was the name of the printing, music printing. Right. And I just was reading it and I just started doing it. I mean, they were expecting me to be demanding and ask them for lots of help. And because I just started doing it, then they, started accepting me for that. And also I started bringing in computer music journal and say, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1340.865" data-end_ts="1341.085" title="1340.865" id=c_"1340.865">__oh__</span>, right <span style="color:red" data-ts="1341.395" data-end_ts="1341.685" title="1341.395" id=c_"1341.395">__know__</span>, look at this, you know, <laugh>, we would talk about the articles and try to figure 'em out together. And that's how it started. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's really interesting. But it's also interesting to, to hear that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1352.725" data-end_ts="1352.965" title="1352.725" id=c_"1352.725">__<inaudible>__</span> just bailed on you. That's <laugh>. You know, there, there is something that I think over the history of music, there's always ha there always has been like this concept of the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1367.805" data-end_ts="1368.005" title="1367.805" id=c_"1367.805">__cut__</span> cutting room or something. Right. You know, it's like, I just think of like, you know, the discussions about Charlie Parker's early history, right. And he goes to play in this really difficult scenario and he kinda scuffles through a solo and someone flings a symbol at his head. Right. You know, the, the assumption is like, well, during these computer things, you know, these guys are kinda like grungy, workaholic, self-driven nerds. Right. Or something. And I think people don't realize how much they just badly wanted somebody that would come in and grind it out to learn how to use it because, it wasn't a very social, a lot of this stuff wasn't very social. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I, my interaction was, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1415.685" data-end_ts="1415.885" title="1415.685" id=c_"1415.685">__it__</span> wa was at North Texas. They had, they were doing some stuff with trying to get a, a system working on ear training and they were hand wiring boards and all that kind of stuff. Right. And, at the time I wasn't really into computing devices at all. And so I, you know, I came in as a bit of a skeptic and I think I was the typical case that they ran into. I'd come in, I'm like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1439.845" data-end_ts="1440.005" title="1439.845" id=c_"1439.845">__ah__</span>, I don't anyone want to do this. Right. So my suspicion is what you ran into was the opposite, which is they were sure you were gonna come in and make those kind of sounds. And when <span style="color:red" data-ts="1450.045" data-end_ts="1450.125" title="1450.045" id=c_"1450.045">__you__</span> came in and said, give me the manual, so I wanna figure this out, that was maybe the what it took to break through. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>And maybe it was just <span style="color:red" data-ts="1457.645" data-end_ts="1457.885" title="1457.645" id=c_"1457.645">__that__</span>, that we, it was a shared passion. Right, right. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So <span style="color:red" data-ts="1463.205" data-end_ts="1463.325" title="1463.205" id=c_"1463.205">__you__</span>, you learned this system in order to print music. How long did you spend doing that before you just started working on coding? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>Oh, well, I think I, I was also using, I started using their synthesizer. I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>See. Okay. Right. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>And I had been coding already because of Texas Tech University. I took, sort of the intro 1 0 1 to for electrical engineers. And so I learned how to write FORTRAN on punch art. Also at the School of Music I was studying with, I was using Music 360 and writing these subroutines to alter the score. So I was doing some programming and you know, there was this Apple <span style="color:red" data-ts="1508.025" data-end_ts="1508.245" title="1508.025" id=c_"1508.025">__two__</span> that had live basic running at the prompt. And I, I'd written like these recursive transition networks to write to come up with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1516.245" data-end_ts="1516.365" title="1516.245" id=c_"1516.245">__a__</span>, a random sentences and <laugh>. Right. So, I mean, I was already doing some coding. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The system that they put together, what were they calling it at the time? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>So the, the first thing, the first one that I used there was called Interactive Music System. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. The Interactive Music System. Okay. And was that truly interactive? Was it doing real-time synthesis? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that must have been a big jump for you <span style="color:red" data-ts="1541.515" data-end_ts="1541.805" title="1541.515" id=c_"1541.515">__have__</span> going from Music 360 to that. Right. Because Music 360 is sort of like, you intellectualize your thing and then you produce it, and then you respond to what you heard and you make your adjustments. Right. In my experience with commuter music, that was the first stuff. And in fact, a lot of times it would be these things where people would develop this and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1561.085" data-end_ts="1561.245" title="1561.085" id=c_"1561.085">__it__</span> would put it on, eventually put it on tape, and then their performance would be the tape and then them on an instrument playing along with the tape or something like that. Right. Are those the kind of things you were working on? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>Yes, but in parallel I was also in, working in the studio with analog electronics. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, I see. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>So Scott Wyatt's, experimental music studio. Right. Which was a huge <span style="color:red" data-ts="1585.925" data-end_ts="1586.165" title="1585.925" id=c_"1585.925">__thing__</span>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1586.165" data-end_ts="1586.405" title="1586.165" id=c_"1586.165">__Like__</span> the very first time I arrived in Illinois, I went to the studio and asked Scott White how I could help him get the studio ready for the fall. So he <laugh> he put me in a room, soldering patch cords, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Nice. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>I'm sure he had had to throw 'em all away. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What, what better first step than this? <span style="color:red" data-ts="1606.515" data-end_ts="1606.805" title="1606.515" id=c_"1606.515">__Have__</span> <laugh> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1607.205" data-end_ts="1607.485" title="1607.205" id=c_"1607.205">__have__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1607.485" data-end_ts="1607.685" title="1607.485" id=c_"1607.485">__to__</span> solder <span style="color:red" data-ts="1608.125" data-end_ts="1608.365" title="1608.125" id=c_"1608.125">__badge__</span> cords. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>But anyway, the first thing I noticed when I walked in over the door, it says Experimental music studio, not electronic music. Right. But I, that's kind of stuck with me. I still think that's more important than whether the sound is made electronically, digitally, acoustically. It doesn't matter so much as this experimental aspect of it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, let's, let's fast forward. I don't want to use up <span style="color:red" data-ts="1637.005" data-end_ts="1637.125" title="1637.005" id=c_"1637.005">__all__</span> my time on 1984 here. I want to kind of take that as an opportunity to shoot to, to the current currently what you're working on. Because what you just said is an important element of what my experiences are with CHE users. I find first of all that, that the CHE users that I know a lot of 'em are either related to like the sound design industry in, in Hollywood or commercial sound design out of New York. But I know some people that are doing academic work as well with them, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>Also game developers 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And game developers. Right. But one of the things that I notice is that people that are using the Chema system have this tendency to really blur the lines, blur all kinds of lines, blur the lines between acoustics and electronics, blur lines between the hardware and the software and where their ideas are implemented. They're a lot more about integrating their work into the whole of the studio rather than trying to have everything work out of a single box. Interesting. And, I think that that's, I think it's interesting, but I also, that's gotta come from somewhere. And I'm wondering in your experience, what is it that, how, what is it that draws people to the chemo system in particular? And what might be the reason why people are so intermediate oriented, with what you've developed? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>That is an interesting question. I think it, part of where <span style="color:red" data-ts="1737.235" data-end_ts="1737.525" title="1737.235" id=c_"1737.235">__Kima__</span> came from was this idea of sound that you could make music from sound that the basic organizing, structure is sound and not the notes of music notation. Because, to me, what I, what I felt in the studio, in the electronic studio and with cutting tape, was that this was a radically new art form. It wasn't just a continuation of music history. It wasn't a smooth continuation. It was a radical new departure. Like, just like film is a new art form compared to, stage theater. You know, we <span style="color:red" data-ts="1780.765" data-end_ts="1780.885" title="1780.765" id=c_"1780.765">__were__</span> making the sound, you're making it by either this fluxx patterns on the, on the tape or by a pattern of symbols in the computer. And it didn't have to be organized in the, it didn't have to be simulated as an orchestra with instruments playing a score with notes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>I mean, that's one way to organize it, but there could be other ways to structure it. There could be new kinds of structures that you could build. And so that was one of the things I wanted why I needed chemo. 'cause I wasn't finding that was to make a language that was based on sound, where you could build new kinds of structures based on sound. Maybe that's part of what your, why it would attract people who are interested in sound, sound design in the abstract, but also the kind of music that is sound based rather than note based. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and using a variety of input things, especially what, what I see a lot of is using voice or using traditional instruments as the input mechanisms that are then processed or tracked or in some way, managed and manipulated by the CHE system. I I see that much more than I do with other systems. And what you just said is what you, you point out is something I'd never, I'd never thought of it that way, which is that it is a radical new art form because it's not a continuation of notes on the paper being delivered to a listener. It's a different thing. And I never really thought about it that way, but that's a really powerful way to consider what, what we're all doing. And, and it means that also, and maybe this is just a personal thing, but it means that I also don't have to denigrate my own work because it didn't start off as notes on paper. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>Oh, absolutely not. <laugh>, it started out as music. I mean, music doesn't mean notes. That's notation. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Sound, it's, that's fantastic insight. I, that's cool. So one of the things that, you know, I, I obviously work on the development of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1914.065" data-end_ts="1914.285" title="1914.065" id=c_"1914.065">__Max__</span>, which is, this kind of graphical development system. The, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1919.085" data-end_ts="1919.285" title="1919.085" id=c_"1919.085">__<inaudible>__</span> system is also based off of a graphic development system as well. First of all, why was that chosen as a direction to go? And secondly, you've stuck with it, so obviously it's been effective. What is it about a graphical development environment that you think is particularly useful for artists as designers? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>I actually don't think the visual aspect of it is as important as the underlying data structure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, interesting. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>However, you bring up a good point, which is if you find the right interface, it, there's always this, like the holy grail of finding the right interface that reveals the underlying functionality that's there in a way that is very efficient for people, very intuitive and natural for people to think about, conceptualize and utilize it. Like I always think about the, the example that I, that really brought that home for me is the timeline in <span style="color:red" data-ts="1988.885" data-end_ts="1989.125" title="1988.885" id=c_"1988.885">__chemo__</span>. From the very beginning, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1991.255" data-end_ts="1991.605" title="1991.255" id=c_"1991.255">__chemo__</span> always had these, these modules that were called time offset and, set duration. They were there from the beginning, but nobody, no one ever used it because it was really hard to think of you, you'd have all these sounds in a mixer and some of them you would offset in time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>And I, I noticed that I would, I found myself like getting a piece of paper <span style="color:red" data-ts="2017.945" data-end_ts="2018.165" title="2017.945" id=c_"2017.945">__and__</span> sketching. Like I would sketch a timeline and say, when I wanted the things, then I would put it in. Then I finally realized, wait a minute, I should just put the timeline on the screen. And when I did that, boom, everybody started using it. And that's probably the most commonly used, interface in chemo right now <span style="color:red" data-ts="2038.725" data-end_ts="2038.925" title="2038.725" id=c_"2038.725">__is__</span> the timeline. Yeah. So now whenever I find myself sketching something on paper, I try to think of it, if there could be a way to put 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It that seems to align both going back to the paper and in our discussions today, one of the things that you seem to be really sensitive about and really thoughtful about is avoiding the general purpose and, and focusing on the specific, and like in this case, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2063.875" data-end_ts="2064.165" title="2063.875" id=c_"2063.875">__that__</span> what the right interface is, it's not just, it's not the the right interface for everything. It's the right interface for a specific kind of task. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>That's right. Yeah. Placing things in parallel and ordering them in time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. I think that that's, that's a really interesting thing and I think that that is an important part of what you're doing in your work, which is you are provi and, and maybe why it's got, such a strong and dedicated following is the people that are, that the people that need a specific interface find you focused on providing that kind of interface. And that's pretty powerful. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>But that's only one interface in <span style="color:red" data-ts="2108.195" data-end_ts="2108.485" title="2108.195" id=c_"2108.195">__Kima__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>One possible interface, right? <span style="color:red" data-ts="2109.925" data-end_ts="2110.165" title="2109.925" id=c_"2109.925">__Yeah__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>That's, I mean, there are others. There's the, for example, we have this time alignment utility, the Tau editor. And that's a way to take several sounds and it, analyzes 'em and pulls out their amplitude frequency and, brightness envelopes. Okay. And then you see those as graphic envelopes in a tab, and then you can just move them, you know, you click on there and adjust 'em and line them up. Uhhuh <affirmative>. So I mean, that's a, yet that's a different interface for a different task. But under it all, there's always sounds, I mean the, the right what we call the sound, a sound object is the basic data structure. So underneath it's all sounds, and you couldn't see it as a dag, but it would be really hard to figure out 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>To 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b><laugh>. So there's just a different interface on that same data structure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So I appreciate that and, and this variety of, of interfaces, again, it's, it's something that I think is really, it's interesting and because it, it allows for an idiosyncratic maybe, implementation of things, things, again, things that couldn't be generalized without losing some of their meaning or losing facility on it. Right. I think that's super valuable and I, I appreciate the efforts that you've put in on that. I'm curious to know if you've <span style="color:red" data-ts="2193.835" data-end_ts="2194.125" title="2193.835" id=c_"2193.835">__been__</span> scribbling on paper and watching what you're doing. Have, are there things that are kind of on the sketch <span style="color:red" data-ts="2201.205" data-end_ts="2201.525" title="2201.205" id=c_"2201.205">__board__</span> for you that you think, are are future opportunities for interface? Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>For the, yes. Well, one of the new things in <span style="color:red" data-ts="2213.285" data-end_ts="2213.485" title="2213.285" id=c_"2213.285">__Chema__</span> seven is, called the gallery. And the gallery is a just a button that you press. You start, you give it a file and you press this button and it generates algorithmically, generates a whole bunch of, signal flows based on that file. Okay. That is a direction I'm interested in pursuing even further. The idea that, to take it another level, like this whole idea of recombinance and modularity, but to take it to the next level where the software maybe can suggest some new things, new directions that you would not have thought of, because I already find myself really surprised. I really, it's really fun. 'cause you can, you make a gallery and then you, you roll the dice, you click the dice button and you get these, you know, random combinations, but you never would've thought of putting these two things together. Right. And then sometimes it's terrible, but really more often it's like amazing. They're just like, beautifully, how did I do that? And then you, it <span style="color:red" data-ts="2287.805" data-end_ts="2287.845" title="2287.805" id=c_"2287.805">__is__</span>, you're learning stuff by these new serendipitous combination. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's amazing that, a good dice roll still is valuable. Right. <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2299.275" data-end_ts="2299.565" title="2299.275" id=c_"2299.275">__More__</span> dice, more <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's, that sounds really, that sounds really exciting. Now, can you tell us a little bit about, the upcoming symposium, the KISS symposium? You said it's in <span style="color:red" data-ts="2311.965" data-end_ts="2312.125" title="2311.965" id=c_"2311.965">__Enlight__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>In Leicester? Yeah, in Lester it's M University. Okay. It is, the theme is emergence. So emergence is that kind of inexplicable thing that happens when groups of people perform together or get together to discuss something or work on something together. So it's this idea that you could, if you have a, a network of agents, which could be people and machines and other things, you can have very simple interaction rules and some larger pattern can arise out of these really simple interaction rules. And, and often these larger patterns are completely unanticipated. There's so many ways that that happens in music and, and in software and, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And in social environments. And I would imagine, especially when you get a group of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2365.715" data-end_ts="2366.005" title="2365.715" id=c_"2365.715">__Kema__</span> users together and start sharing ideas that there's a certain amount of a certain amount of emergence that even comes from that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>Very much so. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2375.225" data-end_ts="2375.445" title="2375.225" id=c_"2375.225">__And__</span>, and just unpredictable in this really beautiful way that you <span style="color:red" data-ts="2379.605" data-end_ts="2379.845" title="2379.605" id=c_"2379.605">__would__</span> expect people from these really different backgrounds and their, their ideas come together and something really un unexpected happens. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Well one last question I want to throw out there, because I'll be curious to know what you think is, what do you see as both the near and the long <span style="color:red" data-ts="2398.485" data-end_ts="2398.725" title="2398.485" id=c_"2398.485">__term__</span> future for musical technology? What do you think are the things that you excited to see come about both like in the next couple years, as well as what do you project 10 years from now, 20 years from now? What do you, where do you think it's gonna go? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>So one, this one thing I'm really fascinated by is these meta materials that are coming up where they're able to create wave guides to push sound around. It's really fascinating. I think that it's like where the structure of the material is more important than what the material actually is. And they're doing some amazing things with the sound lenses and, sound, cloaks. And I think that, I mean, that's part of music technology as well. Also another thing I'm really excited about is the interaction of light and sound in the air. Because sound can, because it's a pressure wave, it sets up these rare factions and dense, dense areas and less dense areas in the air. And actually that, changes the refraction of light in the air. And I've been reading about people making new kinds of microphones based on that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I I literally ran into a note about that last night about this light microphone and I, I started reading it and I was just like fascinated by it as a concept. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>Yeah. I think that's gonna be, that's a future. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That's amazing. Right.

<b>Carla: </b>Then, I mean, further to what we were talking about earlier, I think we're probably right on the cusp of, of a really big revolution like on, on the order of the software revolution <span style="color:red" data-ts="2504.425" data-end_ts="2504.645" title="2504.425" id=c_"2504.425">__in__</span> the 20th century and maybe kind of a, you know, you're seeing intimations of that with the DIY and the and maker, communities of people wanting to make hardware, get their hands on making the hardware. But I think there's, there will be some technological breakthroughs that make it, that will make it as easy and relatively inexpensive to experiment with hardware as it is with software now there's gonna be an explosion. I mean, there's so many different hardware architectures, but we're all stuck with the same one right now. Right. And when people get their hands on it and start experimenting, that's gonna be huge <span style="color:red" data-ts="2544.465" data-end_ts="2544.685" title="2544.465" id=c_"2544.465">__and__</span> be even bigger than the software revolution. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I, boy, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2549.555" data-end_ts="2549.845" title="2549.555" id=c_"2549.555">__yeah__</span>, I hadn't even thought of it that way. Instead of thinking even something as simple of as a fork, if all of a sudden it just like shoots out in multiple directions where people get the opportunity to take hardware and find out again what makes the best interface for the thing that they want to do, amazing stuff can come out of that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>And it will, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I think, and it will 
</p>

<b>Carla: </b>Futurist <span style="color:red" data-ts="2574.535" data-end_ts="2574.885" title="2574.535" id=c_"2574.535">__horse__</span> fiction, <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>One or the other. It depends if the wing comes off or not. Exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>The booster. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, Carla, I want <span style="color:red" data-ts="2583.725" data-end_ts="2583.765" title="2583.725" id=c_"2583.725">__to__</span> thank you so much for taking time outta your schedule to talk to me. This is a fascinating chat. I wish I had three more hours to talk. Me too. Me too. And maybe the next time I'll just come down for a visit <span style="color:red" data-ts="2595.385" data-end_ts="2595.605" title="2595.385" id=c_"2595.385">__too__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>Yeah, you're not that far. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm not that far. So, and I would love to get, get hands on some of the, some of your most recent stuff as well. So, but thank you again for your time and have a great day. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>You too. And thanks for the work you're doing with this oral history project. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I appreciate it. Thanks so much. Thank 
</p>

<p>
<b>Carla: </b>You. Bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Many thanks again to Carla for the interview time out of her schedule that I doubt she could afford, but she gave to us. Anyway, if you are not, familiar with the chemo system, you're gonna want to take a look at it@www.symbolicsound.com. Thanks a lot again for listening. I hope that you enjoyed this one. I certainly did. And I hope that you continue listening. If you've got some time catch up on some back issues. We're, getting quite a load of, podcasts put together and I just hope that you get a chance to listen through 'em when you get a chance. Thanks a lot and I'll catch you soon. Bye.
