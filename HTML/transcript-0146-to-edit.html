<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. So this week I have the pleasure of talking to kind of an old friend. His name's Robert Heka. You probably know of him as <span style="color:red" data-ts="20.565" data-end_ts="20.685" title="20.565" id=c_"20.565">__a__</span>, the man behind Mono Lake, or as an incredible performer, or <span style="color:red" data-ts="25.805" data-end_ts="25.965" title="25.805" id=c_"25.805">__you__</span> might know of him as a wacky max dude or an inventor of many things. And so we're gonna talk to him today a little bit about his work, his background, his idea of the future. And so with that, I'm gonna say hi to Robert. Hey, Robert. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert Henke: </b>Hi, Darwin. I'm pretty fine. Thank you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thank you so much for taking the time outta your schedule. I know you're a really busy guy. You just got, you just got back from a long trip, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>A few days ago. So the jet lag is already on its way out. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's good for you. That's, for some reason, I, I, as I've gotten older, the jet lag thing just takes more and more out of me every time I travel. So, I can, I can hear where you're coming from. So let's start off, for those people who aren't, super familiar with <span style="color:red" data-ts="70.925" data-end_ts="71.045" title="70.925" id=c_"70.925">__their__</span> work, which I can't imagine there's a lot of 'em listening to this podcast, but just in case there are, let's have you describe a little bit about what you do, what your work is and what some of your recent work has looked like. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Well, here it starts to get difficult already. <laugh>, I'm, I'm always struggling with explaining, especially my music. I started making music, electronic music, and releasing records and CDs some, almost 25 years ago. And at this time, I was highly influenced by, by two things, which were very important. The one thing was more academic computer music, which at this time still sounded very, very different from what you could do at home, right? 'cause it required access to very fast computers out of the reach of normal human beings. And, the other influence was since I moved from Munich, a conservative, beautiful mountain town to Berlin, a <span style="color:red" data-ts="135.485" data-end_ts="135.805" title="135.485" id=c_"135.485">__dirty__</span> and <span style="color:red" data-ts="136.295" data-end_ts="136.645" title="136.295" id=c_"136.295">__rough__</span>, metropolitan, right at the beginning of the techno <span style="color:red" data-ts="140.645" data-end_ts="140.845" title="140.645" id=c_"140.645">__culture__</span>, I became part of that culture. And I guess it's acceptable to say I helped shaping it a little bit, right? My music is a, a blend of those influences. I, I still like to call it techno, mainly because I want techno to be something much more colorful, diverse, and vivid than it currently almost 25 years after its invention became. And that's why I insist labeling it as such, and not trying to find an appropriate name for a sub sub sub genre <laugh> to define my specific niche. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>But of course, you could label it IDM, you could label it EDM, you could label it electro, experimental, ambient German bass, because all of those influences are part of my music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>So let's simply keep it with <span style="color:red" data-ts="197.525" data-end_ts="197.845" title="197.525" id=c_"197.525">__techo__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, sure. That sounds, that sounds great. Now the other thing, though, that you've been exploring a lot, over the last few years has been, both visuals that you've developed or if you, you've worked with other people to develop as well as some, I mean, your, one of your latest things has been, exploring the 1970s worlds of lasers <laugh>. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Well, that's actually not one of my latest things, because that's something which I already do since six years. Oh, okay. So I'm almost at a stage where I would say I know how to play that instrument. <laugh>. The story behind that is that I, first of all, I was always also interested in visual arts. It just never happened that I considered producing this as part of my artistic practice. Right. And at some point, it just became very clear to me that the, the only person who can decide what I do as an artist is myself. There is no external force, which tells me, no, you can't work with lasers, or, no, you can't do something completely different. It's only me. And once I understood that, I decided to just go for it. I decided to use lasers simply because I wanted to use a medium, which for me, felt to still hold some unfulfilled promises with, with video. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>There is such an incredible excellence out there of people who did nothing <span style="color:red" data-ts="295.065" data-end_ts="295.285" title="295.065" id=c_"295.065">__in__</span> the last 20 years occupying themselves with how to organize pixels in space and time. It became very clear to me that I would never reach an appropriate level with my own staff there. And I, I decided that instead of trying to do that, I, I'm looking for a different medium. And lasers were a perfect medium for me because on one side, it's obviously fascinating. Right. And I have a, I have a strong interest in physics, and I've seen lasers when I was already already a little boy at, at some research labs, which I visited. So there's an old fascination for this specific type of light there. And I understand the technical process, and I understand the limitations. And when, whenever I saw a laser show, I thought, there must be more to this <laugh>. There must be more than, there must be more than, than green tunnels and cheesy animations. Right. I, I, I was extremely convinced that I could do something different. Well, then I just started and it became a programming odyssey, and it became a artistic challenge, much bigger than I anticipated. Yeah. As I said, now after occupying myself for six years with the topic, I feel I get to a point where I'm actually being able to express myself in a way which indeed is unseen. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I think that, that's interesting you say it that way and, and that you kind of frame it like an instrument. And that six years happens to be the timeframe. Do you feel like six years represents sort of a baseline time of how long it takes to really go from being drawn into an instrument to being excited by an instrument to end up having the facility necessary to be expressive? Or do you think that that is wildly variable depending on the kind of instrument? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>I, I feel that every learning period or learning curve has it its own shape. And typically there are some, some really exciting things happening at the very beginning because the naivety has a tremendous, creative power. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you don't know anything about restrictions, and everything you do is completely new. Right? So, it is super exciting. And out of this naive excitement, a lot of really cool stuff can come out. And then comes the phase of trying to turn this excitement into refinement. And at the same time, you notice that the refinement is much harder than you thought. And then comes this period of doubt <laugh>, where the initial, rough ideas seem to be too boring, too simple, too easy, but the more complex ideas turn out to demand much more than you can. This is then a, a period, which is quite frustrating in many ways. Then comes a time when, when things start to, to become, more interesting again, when you start feeling that you're in control of the instrument. Right. And, so it's, it's kind of an up and down, and I, I feel I'm at the moment in, in, in this third phase of this oscillation, which is that I transcend from the instrument itself towards the, the meaning behind it. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>So it's not about learning instrument anymore, it's, it's more about I know the instrument inside out. What is it, what I really want to express with it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So, I'm curious when you're, when you're talking about an instrument that is a bank of lasers, I, one of the things I think of when we talk about when we use the name instrument for something, right? What it generally means to me is a combination of things that are, provide facility and limitations, right? So when I pick up a guitar, it's different from picking up a modular synthesizer because the affordances are different, but the limitations are also different. Right. And I'm wondering, with something having never had any experience other than like seeing cheesy animations in a planetarium, I'm wondering what are the kind of limitations that you run? What are the limitations of, what are the affordances that you get when the instrument is built outta lasers and, and spinning mirrors, or whatever the heck it is inside of a laser that makes it operate? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>No, it's exactly the point. It's, it's spinning mirrors, which are in many ways equivalent to high precision loudspeakers. You feed them with an analog signal and they move accordingly. And you have two axis. So there's one thing, laser beam, and you can turn it on and off or change the intensity or change the color. And you can navigate this, this beam in two dimensions. Since it's mechanical, there is a strong limitation how fast this movement can happen. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, sure. Of course. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>And if I simply draw a circle, which I could also do as a human being with a laser pointer in my hand, <laugh>, I can do this maybe five, 600 times per second. Right. Which is very fast. If I want <span style="color:red" data-ts="618.845" data-end_ts="619.005" title="618.845" id=c_"618.845">__to__</span>, to draw two circuits. Things get far more complex because what this implies is I draw one circle, then I turn the laser off, then I stop the movement of the mirrors, then I move my, my laser in darkness, so to say, to a point in this, in the second circuit. Then I start my movement, then I turn the laser on, then I finish the second circuit, then I do the same strategy to go back to the first circuit, which means drawing two circuits is tremendously more difficult and takes tremendously more time than drawing one circuit. Right. So simply drawing two circuits is something that requires perhaps five times the time it needs to draw one circuit. And that, that means the more complex the things are getting, the the slower and more flickery, the the image gets. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, and yeah. And all, it all has to, you have to try and do all of the work in the refresh rate time of your eye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Exactly. And if you can't match that, then it falls apart. Right. And that means there is a, a, a strong connection between complexity and, how stable an image is, or how static it feels like, or how much it is, actually flickering as a, as a very clear side effect. You learn to appreciate simple shapes. And since the, the shapes itself are so limited, suddenly sequencing, arrangement in time, arrangement in space becomes extremely significant. And that's exactly why the, in my opinion, the, the, the terminology of an instrument makes so much sense because it is, is all about actually playing a composition with it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>And the composition is the arrangement of visual shapes in time. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you only have very simple shapes. So you can't impress people by drawing a super complex shape <laugh>. So the only way to, to actually impress someone is by finding a meaningful sequence of shapes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Now in, in, in this instrument that you use, how many lasers are you managing simultaneously? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>That depends on the project. For my performance piece, <span style="color:red" data-ts="760.575" data-end_ts="760.855" title="760.575" id=c_"760.575">__lumia__</span>, I'm traveling with four machines. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>And that's basically a compromise out of time it takes to calibrate and set up shipping costs and all the other things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I was thinking that this has, the dealing with lasers has another one of those kind of old school problems, which is all of a sudden you have to move a lot of atoms around with you. Every time you go, you do a gig. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>I mean, it, it is the last 15 years brought significant improvement in technology there, which is that basically all the lasers you're using these days are semiconductor lasers. And that means no big power supplies anymore. No water cooling. Oh, no. Interesting. Gas, no gas <span style="color:red" data-ts="805.815" data-end_ts="806.055" title="805.815" id=c_"805.815">__filled__</span> tubes. Gas 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Tubes. That's what I was thinking. That's the one thing I remember seeing is the big gas tubes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>And this is completely passed. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Which is of course, from a nostalgic perspective, a sad thing, because it would be, of course, cool, but if, if you have to carry a, a power supply of the size of a refrigerator with you. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. It's not a winner, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b><laugh>. Exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So now throughout all of this experimentation and learning the instrument, learning this laser-based instrument, you've also been creating and releasing music. You've, you had a album come out, earlier, earlier this year, as well as you did a couple of, like, I dunno if they're, you'd call them like EP style releases or whatever, but you've been, you've been keeping up with your music releases as well throughout the whole thing, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>I try, as you pointed out already, it's, it's a kind of, a difficult act of balancing. I don't want to stop making music simply because I, I, I like electronic music too much. Right. And I also want to, to move on there, but at the same time, my, my visual explorations are something that became a essential part of my life too. So I, I kind of try to make a 50 50 split here. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see. Interesting. That's, that's pretty cool. And it seems like quite a challenge because I can imagine that you start working with programming for the lasers or whatever, and that can become a real rabbit hole. You can like crawl in there and <laugh>, you know, not come out for weeks. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Well, that's a, a third aspect to everything I do. And <laugh> it is in reality, I do three things. I I am, I'm making visual concerts and installations. I make music and I program. Right. And unfortunately, <span style="color:red" data-ts="919.465" data-end_ts="919.685" title="919.465" id=c_"919.465">__the__</span>, the programming layer is very often very hidden. And the, the effort is invisible and the beauty is invisible for most people. Which is a bit sad because it is a significant part of my work. Right. Even more significant than I would want it to be, to be honest. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And you say that because a big part of your programming is really doing the things that nobody is willing to do for you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>I was always considering hiring programmers. The problem I have with that is that over the last 25 years, I became pretty good in programming. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And that, implies that someone who is there to help me needs to have my skillset, or I wouldn't be satisfied. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>And finding someone with that background who is, willing to throw his energy or her energy into such a project with a completely inappropriate payment, is it's not gonna happen. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. And complete lack of recognition as well. You forgot that part too. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, you know, there's, there's no, there's no career path here, you know, <laugh>, it's, I I, I, I cannot say, yeah, you, you start with this 200 bucks a month, and if you work for me for the next 50 years, you'll probably earn 400 <laugh>. That's not how it works. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The other thing though, too is, is having, I mean, one of the things that I see for a lot of people who get into doing their own software development for artistic purposes is that the process of trying to describe what it is that you want is often 98% of the problem of getting it done. And by the time you get to the point of being able to describe it to somebody, it's easy to do it yourself. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>That's nails it pretty much in a, in a similar way, this applies to pretty much every working condition. In a more complex scenario, I just managed to offload a lot of my, my administrative work to an assistant Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And meanwhile, she is so good that I don't need to specify every detail anymore. Right. And that's, that's exactly where things start to become fun, <laugh>, because, I, I just tell her, Hey, deal with that interview request here. Right. And she knows what to do with this specific person in this specific scenario. She understands if it's important or not. She understands the context. And that's exactly the, the scenario, which I would of course, also hoping for someone who helps me with programming. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Because 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>If I need to explain a person, you know, I think the drawing sequence should be, first do this, then do this, then do that. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="1110.895" data-end_ts="1111.175" title="1110.895" id=c_"1110.895">__prob__</span> probably you need to, I interpol it here. That's exactly what you said before. If I'm able to express it like that, then actually writing the code is not the big deal anymore. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So you talk about having these three different kinds of practice that you have, and, and one of the things that I'm always fascinated with is talking to people who do have these various facets to their artistic life and finding out how they, how they got there. So for someone who is comfortable with programming, with visual arts, with, with sound art, what is your background? Like, what, what kind of crazy childhood did you have <laugh> that put you in a position to be like doing groundbreaking visual work, doing, I mean, as you stated, really helping the shape, the world that became techno and EDM and these kinds of things. Where where did you come from? What is your background? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>That's totally, uninspiring in a way. <laugh>, it's a classic, story of a kid in, in Munich, which in a way is the high tech capital of Germany. A lot of high tech companies are in Munich, like Siemens and BMW, and a lot of little companies doing stuff for aerospace and defense and stuff like that. So if there's anything that resembles a little bit the gist of, of Silicon Valley, then it's probably the south of Germany. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>And so, my, my family was a family of engineers. They worked for Siemens, they worked for companies like that. There was not the slightest hint of any artistic, strain in, in, in our family genes <laugh>. And I was from a very young age onwards, interested in the arts. And I went to museums. And actually, I remember that I was from very early onwards more interested in abstract arts and contemporary arts. I, I found early 20th century artistic expression, far more interesting than 19th century paintings. Inevitably, at some point I discovered electronic music, the usual way, how you would discover this in the, in the eighties with, craft <span style="color:red" data-ts="1249.405" data-end_ts="1249.645" title="1249.405" id=c_"1249.405">__black__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1249.705" data-end_ts="1249.925" title="1249.705" id=c_"1249.705">__tan__</span>, dream, yellow ish mode, all these kind of things. I, I came to the conclusion that the combination of electronic music and engineering is a good thing. I decided I gonna be a sound engineer because I didn't trust myself as an artist. Not at all. Because that was simply not an option. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>In retrospective, I have to say, it was quite difficult to find my way when there is simply no appreciation for the whole concept of being an artist. That positive side of that is of course, that I engaged very profoundly in engineering, and that provided me with a tool set that shaped my art later also in a unique way. So it's, it has its pros and cons, but an interesting result of all that is the fact that until five years ago, I always had another job simply because I didn't trust myself, enough to say I am an artist, period. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So, up <span style="color:red" data-ts="1314.485" data-end_ts="1314.685" title="1314.485" id=c_"1314.485">__till__</span> five years ago, you Yeah. You always maintained other employment. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I think that would blow a lot of people away to know that. But I can also think, I also think that that will resonate with a lot of people, because unless, and, and maybe it's less so now, but you know, certainly for me growing up, there was always this sense of art is an unknowable lifestyle. Right. You know, I think maybe now there's, there's more acceptance of cre, you know, the creative life as sort of a, a goal or a direction to take a career. But, you know, growing up, I, I never was, I, it was never thought that the creative side of things was nearly as good as being, educated and capable at a skill that you could Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> that you could trade for money. Right. <laugh>. Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b><affirmative>. Yeah. Absolutely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And, you know, my, my parents were from like a manufacturing background, but I think still carried that same kind of thing, which is like, there, there is a thing that an adult life looks like, and then there's art <laugh>, you know, and you should stay focused on this other thing. And, and that had a really strong influence on me and, and made it difficult to embrace the idea of, of being an artist or calling yourself an artist. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Absolutely. I, I, I, I still find it strange, you know, if the classic situation, you sit <span style="color:red" data-ts="1408.705" data-end_ts="1408.865" title="1408.705" id=c_"1408.705">__on__</span> an airplane next to someone and on a long distance flight, and at some point, out of boredom or real interest, you ask what the other person is doing. And it's so much easier to say, ah, you know, I'm a software developer. Right. That's accepted. You know? Right. But if you say you are, you're an artist, then things get more difficult. You just feel this whole rainbow of expectations and images, you know, from, he's an artist. He's flying on a plane. He must be super famous. I wonder who he is, an artist. So, probably someone who never learned how to work properly. Right. <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Probably had very wealthy parents. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Oh, exactly. All these kinds of, the whole scenario, which Right. Can only be topped by mentioning that you are a musician working with computers, <laugh>. Right. That, that's the, that's the <laugh> that basically means you're completely nuts and you can't even play instrument. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Right. Exactly. So I wanna explore a little bit about your early interests in this, in sort of abstract and experimentalism. What do you think, what about your background? Had your allowed your mind to be open to that? Because a lot of times, you know, going through the typical education process, you're sort of like taught and, and also because of peer pressure and stuff, you're sort of taught what's cool, what's not cool, what is interesting and what's real, and what is of value and what's not. When I find people that, you know, express that they had kind of an early interest in experimentalism or abstract art, I'm always curious to know if they've ever kind of thought about why it is that they were open to it when so many of their peers would not have been. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>I think, actually the, the answer is already with, with within this framework, which is if your environment slash parents have no relationship to <span style="color:red" data-ts="1532.425" data-end_ts="1532.645" title="1532.425" id=c_"1532.425">__us__</span> whatsoever. Hmm. They also, since, for them, it's basically almost not existing. Right. They also have no, value, value judgment from one over the other. Right. So I, I believe if you come from this kind of, let's say your parents are teachers as a cliche, and have this, this kind of a strong, bourgeois background of this is proper art, this is Michelangelo. Right. And this is this Joseph boy guy. I mean, look at this shit, <laugh>, they call it conceptual art, which means he can't paint. Right. So my, my parents were none of those, because for them it was simply, they had no opinion about it. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>There was, yeah. It wasn't even on their radar. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>E Exactly. And I had a childhood with not so many friends because, well, I was <span style="color:red" data-ts="1587.245" data-end_ts="1587.365" title="1587.245" id=c_"1587.245">__a__</span>, a bit of a, a socially nutcase, very insecure, very, unhappy and very by myself. And therefore being interested in the arts, was again, nothing which set me more apart from how I was set apart, from the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1604.105" data-end_ts="1604.325" title="1604.105" id=c_"1604.105">__day__</span> go, you know? So as an, as a strange outlaw, it didn't matter anymore that I was interested in abstract <span style="color:red" data-ts="1611.365" data-end_ts="1611.565" title="1611.365" id=c_"1611.365">__art__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. I mean, in a way it kind of freed you to be able to be interested. Right? Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Absolutely. There was some sort of vacuum there, but this vacuum also meant that no one, had a strong opinion against it, <laugh>. And I have to say that there were a few people who I had the, the luck to, to meet, when I was a, a child who were actually supportive. Just some older, guys at school who I became friends and who, who started engaging me in discussions about, about art and politics, a a specific teacher who was, taking me very serious in some of my ideas. So there were a few people who were supportive enough to, to serve as a, a frame of reference. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>So there were at least some people who said, well, no, no, you, you're doing the right thing. You're interested in the right stuff. That's cool what you're thinking about those things, <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That, that is cool. That's nice to have. That's nice to find those people. Now, I'm curious about, when you moved to Berlin and, and found yourself like engaged in the budding techno culture, is that a, is that a point where you kind of, like, when I talked to some people and when they talk about that time period in their life, the way that they express it is I found my people. Right. Did you feel that way with the, with the way that the kind of techno and, rave, 'cause you were, that was like during the early rave culture days, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Did you feel, did you feel like those were your people, or was it just a convenient environment for you to share your work? Or was it that you were more into the artists than you were into the jumper uniforms and the Estoy pills? What, what parts of it represented the draw for you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>I, I, I was never a drugs person. I was just not interested. Mm-Hmm. And I'm still not, but I would definitely say that I, I found my home in, in a certain subculture of, of that scene, which at this time was still very, very narrow and very regional in a way. So it, it, it, it was really family. It was you, you go in a specific club every Friday to meet the same people, which was a good thing, right. Because they were, they were your peers and you were happy to see them. And it was, a very fluid scene in such a way that, for instance, stepping from listening dancing mode to, performing mode or DJing mode was a small step because it was such a non-commercial, experimental scene. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1789.645" data-end_ts="1789.845" title="1789.645" id=c_"1789.645">__so__</span> it was kind of a naive scene too. Nobody ever really thought Oh, absolutely. Yeah. Thought that that was gonna be a money maker for anyone. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Absolutely. I mean, certainly some people recognized at <span style="color:red" data-ts="1799.025" data-end_ts="1799.145" title="1799.025" id=c_"1799.025">__a__</span> early stage that there's potential, but, it was possible to, to do spontaneous parties with friends in, in old empty buildings and just bring in some speakers and carrying half of the studio, five floors up into an empty office building and say, let's have a party <laugh>. Right? What are you doing next Saturday? Do you <span style="color:red" data-ts="1823.605" data-end_ts="1823.765" title="1823.605" id=c_"1823.605">__wanna__</span> play at our party? Oh, yeah. Cool. Let's, let's do that. It was not <span style="color:red" data-ts="1828.525" data-end_ts="1828.725" title="1828.525" id=c_"1828.525">__hard__</span>, like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1829.185" data-end_ts="1829.405" title="1829.185" id=c_"1829.185">__oh__</span>, I need to talk with my agent, or, how much do you offer? It was, oh, yeah, that's a cool space. Great idea. Yeah. And, yeah, that certainly that, was important for the whole scene in as a, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1842.575" data-end_ts="1842.795" title="1842.575" id=c_"1842.575">__in__</span>, as a development in, in general. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So how did you go from being a guy who would show up with half his studio to, developing the concept behind Mono <span style="color:red" data-ts="1856.985" data-end_ts="1857.275" title="1856.985" id=c_"1856.985">__Lake__</span>, your work with Gerhardt on developing that to developing a sound? How did that, how did that all shape itself? I mean, I'm sure it wasn't planned, so I'm just curious how you saw it form itself. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Well, the, the Mono <span style="color:red" data-ts="1872.835" data-end_ts="1873.115" title="1872.835" id=c_"1872.835">__Lake__</span> story, I, I think that this serves a, a bit of a longer loop back because it is a, a very personal story, which is a, a beautiful one to tell already. When I was in Munich, I was obviously interested in electronic music. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And there was a, a shop in Munich, which was actually a branch of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1894.875" data-end_ts="1894.995" title="1894.875" id=c_"1894.875">__a__</span> even bigger shop, in Bon, the former German capital, west German capital. And this shop was pragmatically called the Synthesizer Studio Bond. And it was pretty much the, the first, music shop exclusively for electronic music instruments. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>And the, the Munich branch itself was located in a, in a fancy neighborhood, in a small but fancy shop with big shop windows. And you looked through the shop windows and you saw a beautiful blue carpet and little, keyword stands with all the amazing gear you could never afford, like a PPG system, a fairlight, everything you would want. Right. And at some point, I was brave enough to, to enter the shop, and I became friends with the guy who was running the shop. It turned out that he had his own apartment above the shop, under the roof, filled with even more equipment than the shop had. And so we had some, some funny sessions there making music. And he had, he shared his flat with a person. I, I really didn't like very much. You have to imagine myself at this point as kind of the very insecure goth boy with an earring, which was, quite something at this time, and long hair and black <span style="color:red" data-ts="1973.005" data-end_ts="1973.205" title="1973.005" id=c_"1973.005">__clothes__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Okay. And, and socially very awkward. The, the person living, together, with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1981.295" data-end_ts="1981.695" title="1981.295" id=c_"1981.295">__wheeland__</span> at this flat was, very much the, the, the anti-pop <span style="color:red" data-ts="1987.765" data-end_ts="1988.055" title="1987.765" id=c_"1987.765">__that__</span>, like white, bright, close Kashmir, you know, from a, from a slightly more wealthy background in that way, just very much the opposite of myself. Right. And I definitely didn't get along with this person <laugh>. And I think this was very mutual. So I moved to Berlin and I started computer science at the very first, lecture at the university. I, I look around and guess who is sitting there, the sky. And I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2022.415" data-end_ts="2022.615" title="2022.415" id=c_"2022.415">__stay__</span> at the sky and think, what the hell is Mr. Mr 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Mr. Cashmere? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Mr. Mr. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2027.675" data-end_ts="2027.895" title="2027.675" id=c_"2027.675">__Kir__</span>, is sitting in my lecture in Berlin. I mean, hello, what the, what is this supposed to be? So, and he <span style="color:red" data-ts="2036.695" data-end_ts="2036.975" title="2036.695" id=c_"2036.695">__star__</span> at me, of course. And, at the end of the lecture, we, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2041.055" data-end_ts="2041.275" title="2041.055" id=c_"2041.055">__we__</span>, we ran into each other, like, what are you doing here? Yeah. Well, I could ask you the same. Right? So let's have coffee <laugh>. And this was of, and of course this was Gerard <span style="color:red" data-ts="2049.995" data-end_ts="2050.315" title="2049.995" id=c_"2049.995">__Billis__</span>, of course. And, we became very, very best friends because we noticed that, we <span style="color:red" data-ts="2057.555" data-end_ts="2057.715" title="2057.555" id=c_"2057.555">__had__</span>, we are, we are complimenting each other in a, in a nice way. And we started hanging out and we started going to concerts and to clubs. And we started, of course, making electronic music together and programming max patches to do, the things we wanted to do. Gerhard actually introduced me to Max, because he already got introduced to it much earlier than I Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b><affirmative> at some point, we created this, created this project monologue together. And how we came to the name is another funny story, but maybe not that important, and you can read it up in multiple interviews. And we had a pretty nice time together making music. And Gerhard finished, his computer science studies, and I didn't, because I found a very lucrative job in <span style="color:red" data-ts="2105.335" data-end_ts="2105.455" title="2105.335" id=c_"2105.335">__a__</span>, studio, and that killed my academic career as far as studying computer science is concerned. Right. And Gerhard started to work for Native Instruments, and he met another developer there, and they both decided we, they need to found their own company. And that was the birth of Abel. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>And, when it came to deciding what <span style="color:red" data-ts="2130.815" data-end_ts="2131.105" title="2130.815" id=c_"2130.815">__this__</span>, this music software actually is supposed to do, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2134.415" data-end_ts="2134.705" title="2134.415" id=c_"2134.415">__they__</span> had basically, came back to me and said, Hey, Robert, we, we need to talk about things. And that's how I became part of this whole thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>And it was very clear from my perspective that the one thing no one did before is creating a product that is really tailored towards the needs of, of us, of us electronic music people, of us people who have the desire to perform with a laptop on stage. Right. And do something that is informed by our way of thinking about structure and music and sound. Yeah. And at, at this time, it's culturally interesting. If you, if you look back at this time, there were two, two dominant ideas. The one dominant idea was, an interface design idea of dangling cables and wood panels 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>In, in, on a screen to not alienate people who came from hardware so that they have something that looks like hardware on screen, which we found, which we found childish. Right. The other thing was the idea of, computers in a studio serving the high <span style="color:red" data-ts="2204.165" data-end_ts="2204.385" title="2204.165" id=c_"2204.165">__end__</span> market, this whole, like, we have a 32 Track Pro tools rig. Right. There was a specific case, which I very vividly remember, a German sequencer manufacturer, which later was bought by a computer manufacturer, had this ads where you saw on the console a Porsche car key 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>So, you know, the, the, the marketing was aimed towards the, the Trevor Horns of this world. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>And this was so much not our target, group, and we knew that if we create something for a different audience, we will pick up people who were completely not the target group of all the other companies. And the rest is history. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, and, and there was a lot of brilliance in that because so much of what computer commonly available computer music tools were just, just hearkened so so heavily to the past. I mean, the fact that everything really relied on the tape machine metaphor when it didn't have to anymore, but it was, it was amazing, you know, that, that that metaphor had stuck so completely with the music software world. And I mean, you still see it in, in most software packages, and you see it. I mean, to me, I, lately I've been doing a lot more work with video editing, and it's really shocking to see how little has changed for video editors in terms of the paradigm that they work and how much it's very much still like working with two video <span style="color:red" data-ts="2305.895" data-end_ts="2306.185" title="2305.895" id=c_"2305.895">__tape__</span> decks <span style="color:red" data-ts="2306.585" data-end_ts="2306.705" title="2306.585" id=c_"2306.585">__and__</span> a video mixer. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2308.925" data-end_ts="2309.145" title="2308.925" id=c_"2308.925">__Yep__</span>. So true. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. And it's, it's just really odd to see that the, the tools grab these metaphors and stick stubbornly to them. And so it was a really big, it was a pretty big shakeup to, to see what Den came down with. But boy, it hit, it hit big and it hit fast. It, I remember when version one came out, I was, I was, you know, part of, I was a non-employee, but part of the Cycling 74 world then, and I remember seeing what was coming down the pike and being very excited about it. And that's cool. Now to, to what extent did what became Ableton Live? To what extent did that meet your needs? Or, and to what extent did you still feel like, well, it's good, but I need to continue making my own tools. I mean, was there a time period where you, were a live performer, Ableton live performer? Or did you continue to make your own tools? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>I was always a bit twisted in my emotions towards the software for, for live performances. I embraced it very early. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, let's say from version two onwards. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>It forced me to, to very much, redefine my, my performance practice in a way, which was the result of technical limitations. I'm a synthesis person. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I like, I like the idea of real-time synthesis. I like the, i a big part of my performances where money coating sound. So I'd rather have a simple synthesis algorithm, let's say an f an FM sound where I have a knob, which drastically changes the tbr mm-Hmm. <affirmative> as, as part of the performance practice. Right. And, the, the first version of life, where simply sample loop based, because that was the only thing which could run in real time on, on the computers at that time, <laugh>. So, and this brought in some, some static loop <span style="color:red" data-ts="2435.875" data-end_ts="2436.225" title="2435.875" id=c_"2435.875">__based__</span> appeal into my music, which I didn't find app found appropriate, and I still don't do. So things started to really become interesting to me with Life four, with the addition of, synthesis. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>If I would, should name a single contribution to the software, which was most significant, then its operator. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, I remember when operator was released. You were very, you were very closely identified with it. My assumption is you had a hand, you must have had a hand in its design, but I know that, I remember being at the NAMM show when it was introduced, and you were there, and, you know, I would talk to you and you would sort of, you were into it, you found operator a, a really great tool for expressing kind of your synthesis voice. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Unfortunately, I lost the original Max Patch, which, was the, the prototype. I, I looked through all the backup drives and, it is gone. And it's, it's really sad. It's not, it's not on a CD somewhere. It's, it's just nowhere. Oh, man. Because, in Indeed operator is let's say 80 to 85%, my development. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see. Interesting. Well, and I remember when it first came out playing with it, you know, my experience with fm, it had always been like, you know, the DX seven and that kind of thing. And so in my head, it represented a certain kind of thing. And then, the, the banks of sounds that came with the, you know, the original implementation of operator kind of twisted my head up because there were many things there that I considered atypical for an FM sound. And it opened my, it opened my mind up to think of FM in a different way. You know, so for that, I actually owe you, owe you Thanks. Because it, it started me on a path of like considering FM as a lot more interesting of a tool than just, you know, being able to play really bad fender roads ations. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Actually, in, in all defense of John <span style="color:red" data-ts="2571.935" data-end_ts="2572.285" title="2571.935" id=c_"2571.935">__Ching__</span> and DX seven, the Fender Road emulation is gorgeous. <laugh>, this, this has to be said, <laugh> 2022 years, or 20, no, 22 years <span style="color:red" data-ts="2584.375" data-end_ts="2584.595" title="2584.375" id=c_"2584.375">__in__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2584.595" data-end_ts="2584.755" title="2584.595" id=c_"2584.595">__our__</span> 32, damn, 1983, I can't calculate anymore. That's a sign of age 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>17, 30, 30 odd years. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>So 30 something years after the invention <span style="color:red" data-ts="2595.615" data-end_ts="2595.895" title="2595.615" id=c_"2595.615">__with__</span> DX seven, the, the roads emulation is gorgeous. And a lot of the other presets in there, so, okay. My, my, my point when I, when creating operator was I didn't want to compete with one of those really big FM synthesizers out there, like with eight operator things with, arbitrary feedback loops, because I noticed that 90% of the sounds I found interesting could be done with only two or three operators. Right. The rest was just to make it, playable over a larger keyboard range or doing things which within the paradigm of life could easily be achieved by stacking. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>The simplicity of the concept was <span style="color:red" data-ts="2641.975" data-end_ts="2642.095" title="2641.975" id=c_"2641.975">__a__</span>, a very big part of it. Then on top comes my certain, my <span style="color:red" data-ts="2646.815" data-end_ts="2647.055" title="2646.815" id=c_"2646.815">__love__</span> for detail, right. There is, there is so many hidden details in the operator, which I'm still very, happy with. For instance, instead of having a noise generator, I have a noise loop. And that was an interesting conflict because the developer said, but the noise loop is, is not noise. It's a noise loop, it's totally inferior to noise. And I said, yes, but you can pitch it down and it actually becomes grainy. Right. And, you can pitch it up and it becomes a tonal structure, and you can modular, you can create high <span style="color:red" data-ts="2681.205" data-end_ts="2681.405" title="2681.205" id=c_"2681.205">__heads__</span>, which sound the same exactly. Each time you play it if you like, or it put it into free run mode, and it sounds slightly different, you can create flanging and phasing noise effects. So a lot of thoughts went into these things, which are simply noise on the front panel. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. That's, that's really pretty fascinating. I, I didn't know that about the, about the noises <span style="color:red" data-ts="2706.865" data-end_ts="2707.085" title="2706.865" id=c_"2706.865">__on__</span> there, but of course, it's, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Well now we have two noise wave. Okay. There's two, two noise wave forms now, because there is of course, also a, a, a valid argument for the classic pseudorandom noise. Right. So basically <span style="color:red" data-ts="2722.285" data-end_ts="2722.685" title="2722.285" id=c_"2722.285">__operate__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2722.685" data-end_ts="2722.805" title="2722.685" id=c_"2722.685">__a__</span> now offers noise loop and noise, and, but these are the things which are really like finding very, very simple things with, with great potential. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That's cool. So I am, I'm curious now, one of the things I heard recently, and I don't know if it's a rumor if it's true or not, is that you have started playing around with modular synthesis. Now I remember talking to you a while back and, mentioning that I was kind of into it, and I was wondering if you were into it and you were kind of like, you know, I don't know if I want to go down that hole again. Right. But it sounds like maybe you have, is that true? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Yes. <laugh>, the, the, and I'm still not sure about it. Uhhuh, the reason why I ended buying modules was a, a funny detour. I bought a Lind <span style="color:red" data-ts="2775.655" data-end_ts="2775.775" title="2775.655" id=c_"2775.655">__drum__</span>, simply because I thought it's such a great icon of computer and music technology. Right. And I saw one on eBay and I had the money to buy it. And I thought, okay, let's do that. I really, put it in my heart because Roger Lyn did a, a really, really good job of this machine in many ways. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> at the same time, I also bought an MS 20 and I, the MS 20 didn't really do much for me. Which surprised me because a lot of people love it, and I know a lot of great music made with it, but it had too many buts for me. You know, this is not, not how I, the envelopes are not how I want them. The LFO is not what I want them. The, the oscillators are not as stable answer on and on. The single thing, which I tremendously liked, was actually the filter section. Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>And what I did with the filters was using the filters to filter some of the drum sounds from the rum, which came out more as an accident. It was simply the result of the MS 20 and the rum sitting next to each other in the studio. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2843.785" data-end_ts="2844.005" title="2843.785" id=c_"2843.785">__And__</span> the lin having all the individual outs, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>So that Exactly. Afford it. Yeah. But I, I find it remarkable that thing as, as spatial closeness, hints to, to certain things you do or you don't do. Right. Because if, if they would be on two different sides of the studio, it would require a lot of cabling through the studio, and you would never do that. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>At some point I noticed that, okay, the envelopes of the MS 20, I don't like, so let's just buy a modular case with envelopes. And then I did, and then the next thing was, well, actually maybe I can replace the whole MS 20, which takes up my space by a simple MS 20 filter. Right. So I bought an MS 20 filter and get, got rid of the MS 20, and suddenly I had my first small <span style="color:red" data-ts="2892.755" data-end_ts="2893.045" title="2892.755" id=c_"2892.755">__rack__</span> there. And, you know, ah, it would be nice if I could have a second filter to filter a specific part of the RA in a different way. I could actually make use of a second envelope generator. Ah, I need a new VCA <laugh>. There you go. It requires, it requires a mixer. Well, and that's a bit of a nuclear chain reaction going on there. Yeah. Yeah. You, you put one piece of equipment in your rack and it immediately, creates desire for two more pieces. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>And, <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And, and there begins the geometric progression. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Exactly. Yeah. And suddenly you notice that you spend an amazing amount of money and time and effort into building this, this stupid rack. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So I'm wondering then you said that you're not sure of it as you're not sure of it yet. Do you mean you're not sure how it fits in your system, or you're not sure if it speaks to you as an instrument, or you're not sure if you're gonna get into it further? Or what, what aren't you sure about? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>I'm coming more and more to the conclusion that the artists I admire most do whatever they do with <span style="color:red" data-ts="2966.315" data-end_ts="2966.435" title="2966.315" id=c_"2966.315">__a__</span> incredibly limited palette. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Including a very limited set of tools. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>And, I on the other side recognize a lot of artists who at some point earned enough money to afford whatever tool they like, who ended up building gigantic studios, and I haven't heard any convincing music from them anymore. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Oftentimes they have to abandon these incredible studios in order to get any work done. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Exactly. And I, my personal problem is that I so much come from the engineering background and that I admire machines because of their engineering. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So I have, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a split personality here. There's a part of my personality who likes collecting specific machines simply because they are so cool. Right? Now, if, if I had a, a big, a big castle or penthouse loft with a few hundred square meters, and I could pick up, let's say a Cray MXP somewhere <laugh>, i, I would just put it in the, I would just put it in the living room with a terminal and run a stupid space invaders game on it. Right. Just, just, just because, just because I can, you know, <laugh>. So, and if people ask me, wow, what is this? Then I would say, well, this is the machine which was used to actually simulate nuclear explosions. Right. <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now playing Space invaders. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Right now it's playing Space invaders. Yeah. <laugh>. How cool is that <laugh>? So what I'm currently doing is I'm rebuilding my little studio and I'm forcing myself to throw out a lot of things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Simply because it is mostly a distraction. And if you have a musical idea and you want, let's say your, your music idea requires a string sound, a a polyphonic string sound. How many instruments do you really need to get this done? Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Well, I would say 90% of the cases, the stuff which comes with enabled is sufficient. If that is not sufficient, then the stuff with <span style="color:red" data-ts="3100.815" data-end_ts="3101.375" title="3100.815" id=c_"3100.815">__enablement__</span> plus, let's say an eventide three <span style="color:red" data-ts="3104.255" data-end_ts="3104.495" title="3104.255" id=c_"3104.255">__reward__</span> box is sufficient. Right. If that is not sufficient, well, maybe a profit 12 is sufficient, but that's it. Right. You don't need to have a Jupyter eight, a <span style="color:red" data-ts="3116.085" data-end_ts="3116.375" title="3116.085" id=c_"3116.085">__Juno__</span> six a <span style="color:red" data-ts="3117.215" data-end_ts="3117.335" title="3117.215" id=c_"3117.215">__a__</span> CS, 80, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, stacked, on five walls of your space to, to get the strings. Right. Quite the opposite. If you have all those machines, the time it takes to decide which machine to use to make the cabling, to, to, put it on the mixing desk to find the, the ground loop, the bookkeeping work gets so big, right. That you end up losing the idea. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and not, not to mention, and, and I've als also felt this way, at one point I had a studio with an amazing collection of analog gear, and two things happened. First of all, at any given time, fully 30% of it was not working for some reason, because it's old stuff and it breaks. Right. But the other thing is, I found that I got too focused on collecting and lost my focus on making music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>That's exactly what I meant. Yeah. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And, and so I can see where, where greatly reducing puts you in a different position. I mean, for me, with my modular thing, basically, a a little while ago, I said, no more, I'm gonna stop. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And it's been interesting because I actually went through a little bit of withdrawal. It's like, I would still go and look at the for sale sites because maybe, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe there is something that'll change my life. Right. <laugh>, it was almost like an addiction, like a chemical addiction. It was very, it was very odd to see it have that effect upon, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>But you're certainly not the only one. I mean, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3212.355" data-end_ts="3212.645" title="3212.355" id=c_"3212.355">__this__</span>, despite the knowledge that having too much equipment is bad. Actually selling equipment is so difficult. Or I, I still have the habit to occasionally look at eBay <laugh>. I mean, Jesus. No, I don't need another synthesizer. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and you'll always find that ridiculous thing, like, like, you know, oh, there's one of those axes I always wanted one 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b><laugh>. Oh, of course. You know, my, my, my latest, my latest sin, which puts a smile on my face because it's in one way, it's so idiotic. On the other way, it's so understandably cool, is a ly saw infernal machine Oh my goodness. Which is, a ridiculously looking reverb from France made in the mid eighties, which is, is an absurd box in its in itself, <laugh>. But it's just one of those things which you have to use occasionally simply due to the fact that it's such a great piece of complete nuts, gear 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, complete nonsense. Right. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Well, you know, I'm pretty sure it sounds great. I, I don't have it yet. I'm waiting for it to come back from service <laugh>. That's, but at the end of the, at the end of the day, it's pitch <span style="color:red" data-ts="3291.925" data-end_ts="3292.125" title="3291.925" id=c_"3291.925">__shift__</span> a plus reverb. Right. So it's, it's nothing that in the year 2016, you couldn't do at ease with a reactor ensemble. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>That's funny. But still the, the fact that I turned this machine on and I have this, this absurd orange green blue design <laugh>, now it's, I immediately hear pretty much the whole <span style="color:red" data-ts="3317.965" data-end_ts="3318.405" title="3317.965" id=c_"3317.965">__JRM__</span> Yeah. Come back catalog and I turn it on <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's great. That's awesome. <laugh>. Well, and you know, I think, I think there are those identifiers though all over in the world of music, music gear. I mean, I, I think that like in the guitar world, orange amps continue to exist simply because people see an orange amplifier and imagine a certain kind of sound coming out of them. It doesn't matter if the sound even does come out of 'em. There's something about the imagination that kicks in when you get this kind of symbolic, your connection. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Well, that's, that's the whole point. Why, it's not so easy for me, a a classic example is I'm a, I'm a proud owner of A PPG Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I think this is one of the most beautiful sounding synthesizers on this planet with a very specific palette. And my latest album release is, is full of it, including songs which contain nothing but PPG sounds Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And there is also plugins, which do a, a pretty good job <span style="color:red" data-ts="3385.545" data-end_ts="3385.765" title="3385.545" id=c_"3385.545">__in__</span>, in emulating this machine. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But for me, the whole point of using the original machine is that I'm not looking at a screen. I'm not having the capabilities of using 20 instances at the same time, but I'm, I'm really focusing on these knobs in front of me, and there's nothing else. Right. It's just me, me listening, playing and tweaking knobs. Sure. And that's a, a, a, a certain type of focus that I found pretty hard to achieve when I'm, I'm working in entirely in software where I tend to do too many mouse clicks all the time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>And that's, that's a, a in part, a specific problem of mine that I tend to make things too fragmentary, too overly complicated too, too many micro edits, and therefore, the limitations of old hardware actually helps me avoiding a bit that the tendency. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So then, I mean, what you just said actually kind of like points to a bit of a conundrum though, right? Because you talk about yourself as having a love of detail, but at the same time, you, you talk about how you have this historical lack of trust in yourself as being an artist. That combination would tend to make, a person would tend to make one think that, oh, you're one of these edit junkies, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3479.605" data-end_ts="3479.685" title="3479.605" id=c_"3479.605">__you__</span>, you'll do a thing and then you'll edit it obsessively. And I don't know if that's true or not. I, you know, you could tell me, but what can you do in that scenario? What do you do to like tamp down the demons that are telling you, you know, what, 75 more edits on this will make it much better, or spending three more days on this synth sound will make it better, or Yeah. It's, that's just never gonna be good enough because it's not as good as X. How do you keep those voices outta your head? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>This is probably the most difficult question to, to answer, because those voices are very loud always. Yeah. I'm very often extremely insecure and not satisfied with my work. It's just that I force myself to move on and even release things because I know that it, it wouldn't change. And I know that other people have different opinions, about the quality of my work, and that I can only make the decision between not releasing any work at all, or accepting the fact that it's never as good as I wanted it to be. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>What I, what I do is I tend to create scenarios with, with inherent limitations, for instance, like my laser work, where a certain, a certain amount of, of detail is simply not possible, and where I'm forced to think in larger structures, because that's the only way to express myself. Right. That, that's helpful. And I have a few projects where I'm operating on, on that basis and what I actually want to embrace more. After years of working pretty much alone, I decided it's really time to start collaborating more. And the one of the last extremely successful collaborations, was with the person who was actually mixing my album. I decided that I don't have the appropriate studio space to, to listen to it in a correct way. And I also decided that I want an external person to mix it, because I want to have a person with a different aesthetics to interfere with my work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>And, and I chose a, a person who is <span style="color:red" data-ts="3624.305" data-end_ts="3624.425" title="3624.305" id=c_"3624.305">__a__</span>, a loose friend of mine whose work I really admire, whose work I know since a long time, and who has in many ways very different concepts of music than I have. But where we have an overlap in terms of fascination for sound. Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>And that's Mark Anesto, who is one of the founders of Basic Channel and, one of my Berlin techno heroes from Back in the Days Sure. Who is, who is now <span style="color:red" data-ts="3652.665" data-end_ts="3652.785" title="3652.665" id=c_"3652.665">__a__</span> day, since last five years, recording music and touring with a group of Senegalese musicians, doing something very, very different, but has a fantastic ear and a fantastic attitude towards mixing. And I worked with him on the album. He helped me actually reducing complexity. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, he helped me to, to throwing out a lot of elements and repeating other elements to get a bit more a steady state, a continuum, a a flow into my very fragmented works. I found this incredibly satisfying, and we will see how the, the world outside, perceives that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that's, that's great though, because it does seem like, you know, your work with Gerhardt was certainly successful as a, as a collaboration. And I know, I didn't get a chance to see when you did the, performance work with, Tariq, but everybody that did said that as a collaboration, that seemed to be a fabulous thing. So it seems like you really, you're a person who excels at collaboration, which I think a lot of people don't. I think a lot of people are either too, you know, you talk about insecurity, but I think an awful lot of people are too insecure to collaborate. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3735.515" data-end_ts="3735.795" title="3735.515" id=c_"3735.515">__There__</span>, there's, I mean, you have to, collaboration requires that you accept that someone else has a different idea. Right. And I would say not only that you accept it, but that you embrace it and that you welcome it, and since I have always this, this, in, in most most collaboration roles I had, I had this abundance of ideas and then comes an external force who says, this is good, this is good. This one, throw it away, <laugh>, or, no, actually this one is good, but it can't come in this position in time. Right. Because you're just establishing that, so it makes no sense if you do this now. Right. God's strength, in my opinion, in our collaboration as well as, in his role as, as the able CEO was always in putting structure in things. And that's why, why he's a perfect CEO. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>He's the one who, who can make the, the right global decisions to say that's what we should do. Right. Right. And this is still something I, I, I really admire him. And where I think I learned a lot in a way, mixing with Mark and Estos was the same thing. He was the one who said, well, I think this part here needs to be more dominant in this track and this part, I would actually make very, very low in level. Right. Also, my collaborations with Christopher Bower, with whom I do this, this large scale kinetic visual installations, he's also someone who, who is very good in actually making decisions, Uhhuh <affirmative> and having an overview. And I, I noticed that I tend to, to enjoy working with people who can have this role. And this requires, of course, in, in the case of Christopher, it's interesting because usually the <span style="color:red" data-ts="3855.225" data-end_ts="3855.445" title="3855.225" id=c_"3855.225">__way__</span>, the way how I work with Christopher Bower is that he has a, a strong overall concept and I make the music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>So he's, he's doing the, he has a strong visual concept, what he wants to do, and I do the sound side and, but unlike all the other people, he's, he's collaborating with, he's not acting like a boss in our relationship. I mean, he, he's, he's, he's commanding a whole company of, of people working for him. But our relationship is different. We are working on equal terms, but still what he's doing is he's the one who, who arrives later at some point when I made things and is listening to things and is looking at the visual side and saying, okay, this part here has to go right. And, and that's of course super painful. And it, it took me a while to, to get comfortable with that situation because you don't want to hear that. You don't want to hear that this fantastic sound design just has no place in this piece. But I, again, I learned that most of the time if he says this has to go, there is a reason for that. Right. And yeah, this is the kind of, of of things, and relationships in, in work, which I personally find very benefiting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I think that that's a really interesting point, and it's one of the reasons why it always works best to work with other strong artists. If you're working with someone who, who doesn't have a strong opinion, then all of a sudden it's, it's maybe too much like, I don't know, too much like ripping a bandage off too slowly, right. <laugh> Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know? Yeah, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Absolutely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>A strong opinion. You're gonna get the real, you're gonna get the real story. You're going to get a reason why. And if you can, and if you can respect their vision, you can, it almost ends up like being, it's a release, it's a release from some of the struggle of saying, I have to make every decision, even if it doesn't seem right. You know? So there's, there's some, there's some really strong value in that. I think. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Oh, absolutely. It, it helps because in a, in a positive way, it also helps <span style="color:red" data-ts="3986.765" data-end_ts="3986.985" title="3986.765" id=c_"3986.765">__ga__</span> gaining reassurance about the good ideas. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>See, because if you work with someone who has the balls and the knowledge to say, this part here sucks, then you can also trust this person that the parts which have been identified as they are good, that they are good, and that they're not just Okay. So it works both ways. So it's, I I, yeah, having, having decisive people with, strong opinions is definitely something which is helpful in an artistic context, <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Once you get used to it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Oh, absolutely. I mean, as you said, it's, it requires trust and it requires also you have to, to learn to let go. And you have to learn that <span style="color:red" data-ts="4036.265" data-end_ts="4036.385" title="4036.265" id=c_"4036.265">__a__</span> criticism of your work of, let's put it this way, you have to learn that criticism of parts of your work does not imply that your work in general sucks. And it certainly does not imply that you are an idiot as a person, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Right. It's just that this specific thing you did doesn't fit in this context. Right. That's a, a very, I important way to look at things. And I guess that reflects back to personal relationship, that reflects back to politics, that reflects back on how you treat your employees. That's all kinds of things you can, you can learn and apply to another different context. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. Oh, man, I could talk to you all day, but unfortunately my time with you is up and it was up a long time ago, <span style="color:red" data-ts="4086.575" data-end_ts="4086.795" title="4086.575" id=c_"4086.575">__but__</span>, we'll, <laugh>, so before I go though, I want, I have watched you, you know, both seeing your performances and listening to your records and, and talking to you online and offline, I've seen you dip your toes into lots of different things, whether it's building works off of field recordings or working with different kinds of visual visualizations or different kinds of hardware or different software, enablers. Right. I'm curious, what is it that, what is it that you have your eye on as maybe a next thing to explore? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Well, on my personal roadmap, there is something very bizarre, which makes complete sense. So, I decided to make a audio visual content piece, which uses five Commodore C-B-M-A-T 32 computers on stage. And, that requires mastering assembly language. It doesn't require a learning assembly language. It requires mastering it because I, I'm 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Telling you, I I, I forgot that you were into this, but I've been watching, I don't know, is it on Facebook or Twitter or someplace where I started seeing pictures of you with these old CBM machines, and I was like, oh my God, he's, he's lost it 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b><laugh>. Well, you see, I assigned a whole year of work for that. So I'm, I'm deadly serious. I bought nine of those machines on eBay, in order to get five machines out there, which work flawless. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, I dig deep into understanding the hardware and as I said, I will, I have to become <span style="color:red" data-ts="4201.195" data-end_ts="4201.395" title="4201.195" id=c_"4201.195">__the__</span>, this whole project can only work out if I become a master in assembly programming because I need to, to, to get every single CPU <span style="color:red" data-ts="4211.435" data-end_ts="4211.715" title="4211.435" id=c_"4211.435">__psych__</span> out of these machines I can get. Right, right. Because those machines were not intended to do real-time video graphics. Right. Those machines were not intended to do sound, but if you're really smart, you, and if you apply an artistic mindset of a very abstract thinking, you can actually achieve something with these machines, which no one had done before. And I'm convinced that I can do that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Is that, is that machine based off the old 65 0 2 chip? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Absolutely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It is. Ah, see, that's, that's where I got my programming bones. I bought this book when I was 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Yeah. Brand's not equal. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's <span style="color:red" data-ts="4248.315" data-end_ts="4248.475" title="4248.315" id=c_"4248.315">__Yeah__</span>. Yeah.

But, I remember being fascinated by working with that stuff. It was, it was amazing to do, you know, to be working at such a small level. Absolutely. You know, the amount of work you have to get to do like the equivalent of an if branch is crazy. And at the same time, once you actually accomplish it, you feel like you're, you really are controlling the world, you know, it's amazing stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Yeah, absolutely. I mean, it is hard to, explain people that the concept of floating point math is not existing. Right. Or that doing a multiplication of two numbers if the result is something larger than 256 requires actually a lot of thinking. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Yeah, exactly. <laugh>. Unbelievable. So, you're giving yourself a, a year on this, huh? <span style="color:red" data-ts="4307.405" data-end_ts="4307.695" title="4307.405" id=c_"4307.405">__Yeah__</span>. When did that year start? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Well, I want to be ready for performing this in 2018. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Because I'm currently working on the third iteration of my laser performance project, which will premiere at the <span style="color:red" data-ts="4322.975" data-end_ts="4323.255" title="4322.975" id=c_"4322.975">__barbecue__</span> in London <span style="color:red" data-ts="4324.235" data-end_ts="4324.455" title="4324.235" id=c_"4324.235">__at__</span> next February, Uhhuh <affirmative>.

<b>Darwin: </b>Unbelievable. Well, I am, I'm gonna be anxiously watching you, go through this process because again, for me that's, that was doing 65 0 2 assembly was like one of the first times I really felt like I was master of a machine and maybe one of the last times too, quite frankly, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b><laugh> <laugh>. So true. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So Robert, I want to thank you so much for your time. Thank you for taking time outta your busy schedule and having a chat. I really do appreciate 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>It. Well, you're of course, very welcome. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>We'll talk again soon. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Many thanks to Robert for his time and for the great chat and also for the opportunity to kind of peer into his brain when it comes to collaboration and how he chooses his projects and even what he's thinking when he bought all those pet computers. But in any case, I wanna thank him so much for the time. I wanna thank you for listening, continuing to listen to the podcast, getting up there in in numbers again, we're gonna be hitting number one 50 pretty soon. That's pretty incredible. And it's all thanks to the great people that I've been able to interview. And you, the listeners, thanks so much and I'll catch you next week. Bye.
