<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today I have the great fortune to, introduce myself as well as you to, an artist that I got to know through Johnny Woods. Her name is Brenna Murphy and is another in like, the series of people that I'm meeting that are sort of like massively multi in the media that they work. And so <laugh>, I hope that's not too silly of a, of a definition, but, rather than try and explain it all myself, I'm gonna ask Brenna to do it for us. So with that, I'll say hi to Brenna. Hi, Brenna, how are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brenna Murphy: </b>Hi. I am good. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm great. So to kick off, why don't you describe the different kinds of work that you're currently doing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brenna: </b>Well, I, I work across a lot of mediums, like you said, kind of based in digital practice, sculptural, I would say digital sculpture is kind of the base. And from there, I bring designs into physical space using, digital tools. And I also work with sound, with my partner Birch Cooper under the name MSHR. And I print out digital images into, onto fabric and make installations. I make animations. I kind of, you know, don't let mediums be boundaries. I am more interested in carrying shapes across dimensions. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. And, it's interesting you say that because when I did kind of, when I first did a drive by your work, it was clear I was gonna want to talk to you because it was sort of undefinable, even even the things that were presented like, through Vimeo or whatever, because it's not strictly animation. It's not strictly like glitchy video work, and it's not, you know, it's not straight video work either. It's this weird amalgam of a lot of different techniques. And so it seems like what you're really into is this idea of instead of like blending concepts, almost like, like blast furnishing them together, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, I found it really interesting. What is it about that kind of function, the, the sort of like welding things together that, that draws you into it? Why, why choose to take that approach? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brenna: </b>I mean, my approach is very intuitive. I guess. I, it's a lot about exploration for me and following a path that feels right. So I guess I, I kind of access tools that feel natural to me and, working digitally always has. And from there I'll kind of pull things, across other programs, and just kind of follow my nose. But I guess it's, I, I really let myself play. I don't have a lot of rules for myself. So I think that's why it ends up expanding into a lot of forms <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Well, that also, by not being really focused on rules, that also does another thing, which is it lets you, it lets you literally jump the rails from one, medium to, I mean, significant rails. So like, one of the things that's part of your practice is doing the sound. You know, I, I was really drawn into the sound of your videos, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And then I saw that, a lot of the sound, which really, it kinda like threw me back to almost like late fifties, early sixties electronics experimentalism, right? Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brenna: </b><affirmative>. Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative> from a sound standpoint. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brenna: </b>Yeah. That's a big influence for me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Ah, okay. Well, good. And, and then I found out that, you know, you had not only done the music, but you had done it on like music boxes that you, whose development you were involved in and Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So you're literally, in addition to making these digital sculptures and digital films, you're also a soundtrack artist who's making your own instruments, which is, you know, that's a pretty far cast for most, most mm-Hmm. <affirmative> artists period. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brenna: </b>Yeah. And that, I mean, that comes out of collaboration really. Okay. You know, I'm in this art collective now called MSHR, but we were part of a larger art collective called Oregon Painting Society for four years. And in that group we were really all about radical collaboration and bringing all of our talents together. So through that collaboration is really how I got involved in like, analog electronics and, you know, merging that with digital imagery or whatever, just, you know, kind of came naturally through that collaboration. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. So in order to better understand what it takes to get where you are, I'd like to, one of the things I like doing on my podcast is talking to people about sort of like their, their story or their trip through life that got them to be the artist that they are. And it strikes me that you must have a pretty unique story because your comfort level with tools and concepts of a pretty broad variety is, you're, you're adept at a lot of different things. And so I'm curious about how you got where you are, what's, what's sort of like your beginning story? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brenna: </b>Sure. Well, I grew up in, outside of Seattle, Washington, and, you know, I was always an artist and my parents always were very encouraging of me. When I graduated high school, I went to art school in Portland, Oregon and studied everything. I <span style="color:red" data-ts="386.955" data-end_ts="387.245" title="386.955" id=c_"386.955">__mass__</span> my major was general fine arts, so I got to take video and sculpture and painting. And, you know, all during that time I was also working a lot digitally on my own. And when I was a teenager also, I was always interested in making Photoshop collages and surfing the internet for photos to make collages with, I, I went through college. I continued working digitally a lot to prepare myself for sculptures and for paintings. But, I kind of eventually realized that my, my digital work was also strong and maybe stronger, and that, that was a legitimate art form in itself. And during that time, I also got involved in, you know, various communities, experimental music community, the net art community, and also this art collective that I became part of. And I think those three communities were really important for me at that time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Communities in the art world can be a lot of different things. It can be people that bump into each other at a bar. It can be formalized into, you know, here's our spot, or here is our group that, that performs or displays together. Of these three groups, what, what was each, like, were they, were they formalized or was it pretty much just kind of the people that you hung out with and were influenced by? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brenna: </b>Well, the, the net <span style="color:red" data-ts="484.965" data-end_ts="485.165" title="484.965" id=c_"484.965">__art__</span> community, you know, it was at, it was before like Facebook existed really. And before Tumblr existed, I was using Live Journal as an image sharing site. And, and, like, you know, it was a blog and I kind of became part of a group of people who were all, you know, making artistic posts using, found imagery that, you know, you maybe repeated and make kind of a visual poem because it was, you know, you had friends on there and you would follow their feeds. It became, you know, a <span style="color:red" data-ts="519.325" data-end_ts="519.445" title="519.325" id=c_"519.325">__a__</span> an online community. And that was new to me, and it was an exciting way to, to share and have friendships that existed purely through images with, you know, people from all over the world. So that, that's kind of that community. And then, the experimental music community in Portland at, at the, where I was living at the time, this was like around, I guess, 2006 to 2011. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brenna: </b>Of course, it still exists and I still in there, sometimes, but yeah, at that time I felt I was like part of a pretty strong space, spatially based community of artists. And, you know, it would be like we, we all lived kind of in the same neighborhood and would run into each other at the same coffee shop and bar and house parties, house shows all the time at different people's houses we perform. And, that was, you know, that's like a very important kind of broad and specific community. And then with, within that, like this group of maybe 10 people at first, that boiled down to a core of five people formed this group called Oregon Painting Society. And that was a very formalized, very specific community, and we collaborated making installations and performances for four years 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now. It's kind of interesting because, so what you've actually done is you've done all of, all of the kinds of groups, right? You know, certainly like your interactions in what you frame as the net art community that kind of follows the, the trajectory of kind of typical outsider artists brought together by the net, right? So we find some way to share and then a bunch of us share in the same place, and then find ourselves aligning with one another. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, the experimental music group. And it's interesting, it's, I Portland, I've had such great experiences with experimental, music in Portland. Oh yeah. It's an amazing place for it. Yeah. Yeah. But, you know, there that is sort of the prototypical, like, it's like a tipping point, right? Where there's something about a community that ends up being the right place for artists of a similar type, and all of a sudden you reach the point where you kind of feel like you're part of a community because you've reached a tipping point of people that are into that thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brenna: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah. I feel it's so natural when it happens. It's like, of course this is happening, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, right? But then with the Oregon Painting Society, that's more like, that was, that seemed like it, like the kind of group that comes together because there's a goal. And in the art world, a lot of times the goal is to say, we need to have enough gravitas to be able to put on a show and have people pay attention, or to put together an installation that will be given some gravity. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brenna: </b>Yeah. Yeah. Oregon competing society was a very interesting path. It was started really, I think, by Jason Trager and Liam Drain. They kind of had the initial idea, and then it took, I would say it took about a year or two of just, we met twice a week and we had no idea like what we were gonna do together. We just knew that we wanted to collaborate somehow. So, you know, we started out just like all drawing together. Eventually we really created a cohesive world together that was pretty intense and amazing. But it took us a long time to get there <span style="color:red" data-ts="749.895" data-end_ts="750.245" title="749.895" id=c_"749.895">__there__</span>, and persistence was really what made it happen. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, I, I, I wanna explore this a little more because this is kind of fascinating to me. Mainly because, I mean, I, I've seen and have been a part of like, online groups coming together and, you know, I've moved to places where it's sort of like, oh, I know that if I show up here, I'm likely to be around similar folk. I have never been part of like a formalized cooperative in that specific way. And so I'm really curious about it to what extent, you said that you, first, you, it was formal enough that you had specific nights that you would get together. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, did you guys have like a kind of a built <span style="color:red" data-ts="795.965" data-end_ts="796.165" title="795.965" id=c_"795.965">__in__</span> politics, like a leadership orientation? Or was it more like, you know, I think of something like <span style="color:red" data-ts="802.365" data-end_ts="802.485" title="802.365" id=c_"802.365">__a__</span>, a knitting circle or something where it's, it's more like a, a band of a band of equals what 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brenna: </b>It was de Yeah, it was definitely, we emphasized that it would be a band of equals that, you know, it was anarchistic. Okay. But of course, we all had our roles that, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="819.775" data-end_ts="820.125" title="819.775" id=c_"819.775">__where__</span> we eventually came to embody, but we didn't, you know, there was no like, named person, but, but you know, the, the dynamic of the group is really what also gave its success. We, four of us lived in a house together, and then the fifth member didn't live with us, but whenever he came over, then, you know, that it was time for our group. <span style="color:red" data-ts="847.545" data-end_ts="847.765" title="847.545" id=c_"847.545">__And__</span>, but it was also, we had, Tuesday nights we'd get together and that's when we would make plans and talk and discuss. And then Saturday all day we would spend working creatively together. So that was kind of our schedule. And Jason Traeger was, he, he was 20 years older than us. <span style="color:red" data-ts="867.905" data-end_ts="868.125" title="867.905" id=c_"867.905">__The__</span>, the four of us that lived together, we were all in our early twenties, and Jason was in his early forties. Okay. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="873.965" data-end_ts="874.085" title="873.965" id=c_"873.965">__it__</span> had a lot of life experience, of course, more than us. And, so he was kind of better at organization and he kind of knew more that like how we had to, you know, be very, intentional about this. And he kept amazing journals, of notes during our meetings. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's very interesting. Now, the name of it, Oregon Painting Society, strikes me as interesting because, you know, certainly in your own work, you don't limit yourself to painting in the least 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brenna: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> <laugh>. Yeah. That's why. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="911.585" data-end_ts="911.805" title="911.585" id=c_"911.585">__And__</span>, and so, I mean, was was it primarily about painting or did you just, or was that just kind of a, a funny trope to add on to? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brenna: </b>Yeah, it was kind of a funny trope. It's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Kind of a joke. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brenna: </b><laugh>. Yeah. But we did end up painting a lot because we would do installations where we'd have to paint a whole wall Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> or, you know, the ceiling or something. So we'd always joke like, oh yeah, we really are the Organ Painting Society, <laugh> <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And, so in, in a group like this, you had five, five people working together. What was the, did you all do similar work or was it wildly different? Or were you like collaborating on pieces? I'm trying to think of like, how you get from a bunch of individuals. I mean, I'm, I'm curious about it because it, it's such an interesting dynamic, but so often really significant work gets done by Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, these small cooperative groups. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brenna: </b>Totally. And while we were all also involved in music, so we all were in bands, together or, you know, in the community. So we were, we really thought of this like, kind of as a band model for art. Okay. Which I think is great <laugh>, because, you know, everything that we made was collaborative in the way that a band makes a song together. We all have like, you know, different, I guess, you know, instruments. If you wanna continue the metaphor, the endpoint is a collaboration. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>How long did it take from the time that you started working together until you had enough work together to start doing collaborative shows? Well, that, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brenna: </b>That was the amazing thing about living in Portland. As soon as we named ourselves and we're like, we're an art collective, we immediately got shows. <laugh> <laugh>. We didn't have to like, you know, have any proof that we had done anything. Oh <span style="color:red" data-ts="1028.365" data-end_ts="1028.525" title="1028.365" id=c_"1028.365">__man__</span>. People were just so excited that there was this young art collective, you know, <laugh> and having that support really made it possible for us. 'cause you know, we would just, I remember we got like a 24 hour residency at this artist run space called Pancake Clubhouse. And we got to just make stuff there the whole time. And then we had a big show the next day that was maybe like one of our first installations. And from there we kind of just like went down the list and ended up showing it like every possible space in Portland, we would have like a show every month for a while. And because there were so many of us, it was actually possible to like build giant sculptures. And we lived around the corner from, a reuse center where it was like an architectural recycling place. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1080.805" data-end_ts="1080.965" title="1080.805" id=c_"1080.805">__Yeah__</span>. So we would go over there and get like big shelving units and then modify them and embed synthesizers in them. And, you know, we all in our backyard and then we, someone had a truck and we could take it down to the art show the next day. <laugh> <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, yeah, I, I hadn't really thought about it this way, but especially if you start doing a lot of shows, not only do you need to, I mean, there's just a lot of activity involved in just making it happen. I mean, you have to do a lot of work. You have to move work in and out, especially if you don't want to be super duplicative, you end up having to, you know, either repurpose old pieces or make new pieces, or, you know, if you <span style="color:red" data-ts="1127.525" data-end_ts="1127.605" title="1127.525" id=c_"1127.525">__are__</span> lucky enough to sell off pieces, then you have to replace 'em. So there's the kind of the churn of that as well. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brenna: </b>For sure. Yeah. It's a huge production to get anything done. <laugh> and our house really became the production house for <span style="color:red" data-ts="1142.055" data-end_ts="1142.405" title="1142.055" id=c_"1142.055">__Organ__</span> Painting Society. You know, we had a big basement so we could keep stuff down there and use the backyard to put everything together. Having all those hands helped a lot 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Sure. I'll bet. <laugh>. Well, that sounds, that sounds like an incredible amount of fun, but also like a, an incredibly productive environment. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brenna: </b>It was, it was, it was really magical. It was amazing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now since then, you've moved to New York, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brenna: </b>Yeah, the only, only like six months ago. Oh, okay. Oregon Painting Society ended in 2011. Okay. So it's, it's been a while. When it ended, we all moved out of the house, and then Birch and I started NSHR or Mesher, you can call it also. And he was also an <span style="color:red" data-ts="1189.405" data-end_ts="1189.565" title="1189.405" id=c_"1189.405">__Oregon__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1189.565" data-end_ts="1189.845" title="1189.565" id=c_"1189.565">__meeting__</span> society, and we started Mesher, really out of that world that we had created. But, sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So I have to ask, because I have to ask 'cause I'm curious guy. What caused the, what caused the collector to end? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brenna: </b>Well, the four of us that lived in a house together, it was two couples and we both split up <laugh> <laugh>. So, you know, we all still loved each other, but Right. We just, it just couldn't continue in the way that it had. Right, right. It just had to like, you know, it ended its course, you know, even Oregon <span style="color:red" data-ts="1227.805" data-end_ts="1228.085" title="1227.805" id=c_"1227.805">__Banking__</span> Society was kind of going stronger than ever, but our personal, you know, being in those relationships just had to, they had to end the way that they were at that time. Right. So it just couldn't all keep going. <laugh>. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So now one of the things you mentioned was, part of what you were doing included this concept that you've apparently continued on with is the idea of having purpose-built little synthesizers that get embedded in the artwork. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1258.075" data-end_ts="1258.365" title="1258.075" id=c_"1258.075">__Okay__</span>. And I noticed this from your, your website, that that has been kind of a just purpose-built synthesizers in general has been part of your practice for a considerable amount of time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brenna: </b>Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative>. And, and it continues on. But did that started off back then, or was it even like before? Were you doing that in school? When did that concept start? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brenna: </b>That started in Oregon Painting Society. But it really started from Birch Cooper. He, he went to Evergreen State College and, while he was there, he, well, you get to make up your own major. Right. So he studied, Sonic Sculpture, I guess. Okay. Which is what he was very interested in, continues to be. And he taught himself analog electronics, building simple synthesizers. And so then in <span style="color:red" data-ts="1311.965" data-end_ts="1312.125" title="1311.965" id=c_"1311.965">__Organ__</span> Painting Society, he brought that into the group. I see. And so continuing in, in MSHR, I don't really build the synthesizers. He does. But we, you know, we collaborate on what, what kinds of parameters we want from them and what the layout will be. But really birch <span style="color:red" data-ts="1334.375" data-end_ts="1334.495" title="1334.375" id=c_"1334.375">__is__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1334.555" data-end_ts="1334.775" title="1334.555" id=c_"1334.555">__the__</span> birch <span style="color:red" data-ts="1335.135" data-end_ts="1335.255" title="1335.135" id=c_"1335.135">__is__</span> the synth whizz. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. And we'll talk more a little bit about your design aesthetic, but I would say that it's also really clear that your infl your influence is all over the design of the enclosures. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brenna: </b>Yes. But actually Birch, birch has a very similar design aesthetic as I do. And he actually like those mirrored the mirrored modulars. Right. He did pretty much all of that 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Because, one of the things, so now we will get into it. One of the things I noticed about your aesthetic, and you actually talk about it in specifics on your website, which is a gob of letters that we'll put in the show notes. People can track it down or people can track you down at mshr info. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brenna: </b>Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But in any case, in, in going through that, there, there seemed to be some sort of like structural things that you're really into. And one of them is sort of like these labyrinthine kind of constructs, right? Yeah. So it's almost like being sculptural, you know, digitally sculptural. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brenna: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And, you know, so that's why I thought that that must, that you must have been involved in the design because that seems sort of aesthetic is very much present on the synthesizer closures as <span style="color:red" data-ts="1413.495" data-end_ts="1413.615" title="1413.495" id=c_"1413.495">__well__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brenna: </b>Yeah, totally. I mean, Birch and I are, you know, we've been collaborating for like 10 years <laugh>, right? So, so we have a lot of overlap <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I was gonna say you're speaking each other's language at this point. Yeah. <laugh> speaking each other's tongue, right? Yeah. So, let's talk a little bit about, about your, your video work for a moment. The way that you play around with genres, with media genres. So for example, there were a number of instances where you would sort of take very stock looking digital video and either subtly warp it or extraordinarily warp it as sort of like a creative device, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But then there were other cases where there was no video at all. It was literally looked like, you know, pure 3D work. And I'm wondering, am I seeing like two different parts of your development of your voice? Or is it two different kinds of work that you like playing with? Or is it just that I'm just that you happen to like it all 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brenna: </b><laugh>? Well, I, yeah, I guess I like it all. And these are, different parts of my development too. I would say maybe when I, around the time I graduated college, I was very interested in not creating any forms myself, but rather identifying things in the world and, collecting them and then arranging them. I felt like that was kind of this, this pure process that I was interested in. So the videos that you're talking about that are kind of look like stock footage, those are all videos that I captured with my camera of the outside environment, trying to just capture the kind of very standard subtleties of the world around me and then bring it in to my workflow and manipulate it and sort of get to know it better through that process. I, that was my, I kind of, the way I thought about it was that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1550.045" data-end_ts="1550.265" title="1550.045" id=c_"1550.045">__it__</span>, the process gave me, a method for seeing more clearly and more expansively the, the world around me by like engaging with it through this kind of formalized method. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, yeah. Yeah. Okay. So basically starting off with video of like the mundane world put you in a position to have to delve more deeply into what actually was going on. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brenna: </b>Yeah. Yeah. Like, you know, having a, having a camera lens, you suddenly realize that your perspective is so specific, you can only look through this one frame. And you know, that's how it always is just with your eyes too. But this sort of like highlights the fact. So using the camera lens as a kind of a way of making myself more aware of the speci, the specificness of, of my own frame. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. And then, like I mentioned, one of the things that was interesting to me is that you have this very, like, very old school sounding, soundtracks that go, that, that are tied to the video tracks. And my question is, which, which would come first, would you do audio and then seek to put together a video to match? Or did you start off with video and then develop audio or even perform audio to match the video? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brenna: </b>It depends on the video. I don't have a set way of doing it. Some of the videos will really heavily use the audio from the video. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and maybe just <span style="color:red" data-ts="1653.065" data-end_ts="1653.485" title="1653.065" id=c_"1653.065">__stored__</span> it and use like, repetition to create kind of textures. So maybe I would take like a little clip of, or sometimes, you know, I would, I would edit the video kind of depending on the sound that was in the video. So, you know, if I'm moving the camera along a flower and there's kind of a interesting, like <span style="color:red" data-ts="1673.545" data-end_ts="1673.765" title="1673.545" id=c_"1673.545">__Dru__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1673.765" data-end_ts="1674.005" title="1673.765" id=c_"1673.765">__drew__</span> sound, I would use that part of the video and repeat it kind of more because of the soundtrack than what's, you know, but also like the combination of what is happening in the sound in the video. So some of the videos are, are completely like that without any added sound. And, but then on the other hand, you know, some, I always am kind of like playing around with sounds and, you know, I have like a archive of sound files to draw from. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So sometimes I'll do the same kind of with video. I'll make a lot of different little clips of animation or video, and then I'll have a lot of different clips of audio and I'll bring them together when I edit like a, a three minute video or something I'll pull from my archives of video and audio and just sort of weave them together. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Let's, one of the things I found really interesting as I went through it, certainly there are different techniques used for the different videos, but they really did, I mean, from a sound standpoint, I felt like they sounded like a single voice, which is hard to do's, hard to do, especially when you're, as you're telling me, you don't necessarily have a set operational order in order to get these things done. So you would think that there would be this huge variety, but it does seem to all carry a voice, which kind of implies the long amount of time that you've put into the audio side of your work too. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brenna: </b>Yeah. The audio side is something that I, I don't think of very much or like, it's sort of an afterthought. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But I think maybe that's telling of its like baseline importance. Right? Like, it, it somehow just has to be there. Yeah. It's part of my workflow. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Now another thing that's, part of your workflow is physical manifestations of stuff. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Now this is something where I think you actually, you go a different direction than an awful lot of digital artists, although with, I guess with 3D printing, you're seeing a little bit more of this, but still not much. Not at, not certainly not at the level that you're doing. You do prints. You said you do fabrics. Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brenna: </b><affirmative>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You do, you do at least some solids. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brenna: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Tell me a little bit about, first of all, when do you decide to take works and turn it into something physical? And then secondly, what's, how do you decide what physically you're gonna end up with 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brenna: </b>It? It really depends on, shows that I have and people that I'm working with to produce, like a show in a space. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> left to my own devices. I don't really produce physical sculptures. It kind of depends. It kind, I kind of need a setting and a budget, you know, in order to realize that, well, so like my work with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1859.965" data-end_ts="1860.165" title="1859.965" id=c_"1859.965">__Organ__</span> Painting Society really like, helped me think in a sculptural installation kind of way. And then, around that time also is when I was getting really into working with 3D programs. And so I started to finally have a voice in designing 3D forms, which I hadn't really had before because I, I don't like, really naturally, I'm not like a builder with my hands Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So that had never come to me, but working with the 3D programs I could easily make a sculpture, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brenna: </b>And so I, I started building up a vocabulary of forms and rendering them out as, you know, as like images of digital sculptures. And eventually I had people contacting me saying that they wanted to help me make those into physical sculptures. And I, the, the first big exhibition of those was with American Medium, the gallery that, a gallery that I still work with. And they invited me to come to New York and have a show at their space. And they, and it was actually kind of funny because none of us had any money and, they are really good at making things with their hands. So they ended up actually physically like cutting styrofoam from the outlines of the sculptures that I had made digitally and produced like tons and tons of these sculptures out of my digital designs. That was, I think 2012. So that was kind of my first time having my digital sculptures, translated into the physical space. After that, I started to get shows that had budgets that could pay for digital fabrication. So I started to learn how to format my files for CNC routing, hydro cutting, laser cutting, 3D printing. And these became like, you know, very obvious tools for me to employ because I could so easily convert my, my digital files into that format. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brenna: </b>You know, I started also really converting my <span style="color:red" data-ts="2010.865" data-end_ts="2011.085" title="2010.865" id=c_"2010.865">__des__</span> I guess always I was, my design, my digital designs are very, like physically possible. Like I think of gravity and I think of like the thickness of things. Right. You know, so that they actually can be pulled out. They have this kind of reciprocity between dimensions 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Of all the different kinds of media that you have, you know, you've created work in. What's your favorite? What, what do you like, what's the material you like working with the most? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brenna: </b>Well, I definitely don't have a favorite, that's the whole point kind of <laugh>. But I, I'd say right now, I, I'm really enjoying printing <span style="color:red" data-ts="2050.225" data-end_ts="2050.445" title="2050.225" id=c_"2050.225">__on__</span> fabric and like, I've been using <span style="color:red" data-ts="2054.145" data-end_ts="2054.365" title="2054.145" id=c_"2054.145">__fo__</span> this <span style="color:red" data-ts="2054.645" data-end_ts="2054.845" title="2054.645" id=c_"2054.645">__fo__</span> suede fabric that I really like. And I've also been printing onto this like banner material that's kind of like a tarp. And I, I really like this stuff because both those things, because you can, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2066.665" data-end_ts="2066.885" title="2066.665" id=c_"2066.665">__you__</span>, you can drape them over things, you can walk on them, you can wrap them around yourself. It's kind of this a more fun surface than just like metal or paper on the wall. And at the same time, I'm also, I've been really enjoying 3D printing, you know, in sandstone with color. That's been, a really fun medium for me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Wait a minute, you, you 3D print in sandstone? Yeah. So how does that, how does that even work? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brenna: </b>I don't really know, honestly. <laugh> <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So there's some, I mean, is it, do you start with a block of sandstone and it cuts stuff away or does it have some way of like generating like stonelike sand? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brenna: </b>I just send a file to an online company and they send back to me this little sandstone sculpture 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2119.235" data-end_ts="2119.525" title="2119.235" id=c_"2119.235">__That__</span> sounds amazing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brenna: </b>Yeah. <laugh> it is. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, for Christ's sake, I gotta try. I have to find something that I want in Sandstone bad enough to try it, because that sounds <laugh>, that sounds outrageous. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brenna: </b><laugh>. Yeah. That's great. It's not too expensive if you get it small. Uhhuh 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative> and well, but that brings up a point, not brings up a couple of points actually, but one of the things I'm curious about, because, you know, having interacted with digital artists over the years, one of the things a lot of us say is, is, you know, oh, if we could only find a way to take our concepts and make physical entities, then we'd have something that was sellable and it would be more valuable to galleries. Right. Right. Is, is that something that you find is real or is that just the hopes and dreams of people that haven't done it yet? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brenna: </b>Well, it's, it's certainly true for some people, but I barely ever sell anything, although I have. But I do have galleries that really help me out in so many ways and they sometimes sell things for me. And I think the, you know, probably the fact that I have things that are potentially sellable helps me to have these galleries which they interest provide, provide all kinds of support for me. But really, I have to say, like most of my income has come from like, doing visits at schools and getting grants and awards. Sure. And performances and stuff. I, I don't sell things very often. Right. But I have a lot of things that are for sale <laugh>. Yeah, there 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You go. So, I'm curious, you say that you, you've had a chance, you do things like at schools and stuff. Have you ever done much teaching? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brenna: </b>I haven't done much beand. I had just taught a six week class on building synthesizers at Pioneer Works, which is, an art space in Red Hook Brooklyn where they have artist residencies. And Mshr <span style="color:red" data-ts="2242.365" data-end_ts="2242.565" title="2242.365" id=c_"2242.365">__is__</span>, we are residents there right now and they also have exhibitions and performances space and they also have a lot of classes offered there. And so we got to teach a class, which was fun, and we, yeah. We really wanted to teach another one maybe in 3D modeling this time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. The reason I ask is because when you were talking about, going to art school in Portland, you talked about your degree being general fine arts, which, you know, it's a no specialty art degree. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, which seems, it seems increasingly rare that people want to even do that. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> it's almost as if, well, if I do that, then I'm not gonna learn the skills or I'm not gonna learn the piece of software or something. And you see people sort of like limiting, you know, having to maybe too early choose a single means of expression and you, you had the luxury of not doing that to yourself. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brenna: </b>Yeah, for sure. I mean, I think it's, if anything, I would think that the trajectory is more toward recognizing cross-disciplinary, you know? Right. Isn't <span style="color:red" data-ts="2313.085" data-end_ts="2313.165" title="2313.085" id=c_"2313.085">__it__</span>? I mean, I think like in the, maybe 30 years ago it was even less likely that they would offer a degree like that 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Maybe so. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brenna: </b>Yeah. But I totally agree. I think it, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2324.165" data-end_ts="2324.445" title="2324.165" id=c_"2324.165">__yeah__</span>, it is still is like that and I think it's a shame, but I also think, I don't know, I, I see art school less as like a technical school where you're learning a specific technical skill, but more as like you're learning the rules of the world of art and you're learning like the history and the context and the community building and the critique. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2347.715" data-end_ts="2348.005" title="2347.715" id=c_"2347.715">__Yeah__</span>. I didn't go to, I didn't get a master's though, so I actually, I I, it kind of would be hard for me to teach. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So given the fact that you've had experience with art school, you've had experience with several different kinds of communities, you've had experience in different places in the country, you know, and experiences with different kinds of artists. If somebody came to you and said, I want to be just like you or <laugh>, or I want to, I want to pursue my art dreams. What direction would you point them? Do you think that going to school is an important step? Do you think finding a community is important? Or is it, or would you be one of the people that says, just do work, do lots of work, get work under your fingers? You know, what is your, what do you think is sort of like the levels of importance? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brenna: </b>It's hard because I think it's so different for everybody. I would say definitely don't go to school if you're going to be put into debt. <laugh>. I am so lucky I don't have debt. And so I was able, when I ended school, I was able to just have as little day job as possible just to pay rent, you know? 'cause my overhead was pretty low and I could focus as like, the maximum amount of time just on my actual artwork. So I think for me, school worked out great because it gave me discipline without giving me debt. But I think that, I, people, I, I think people can get by without going to art school. Definitely. And I think that community is, you know, the most important thing. Getting involved in a local scene that is active with creative people who are, you know, making performances happen and making regular shows happen for each other. I think that's where the really important thing is. And that's what drives you to make work. I mean, not for everybody. Some people can like be by themselves in the woods and make work and be happy. Definitely. But for me anyway, I think being part of a creative community, that's where everyone's like pushing each other and excited to see what you do next. And you're excited to see what they do next. I think that's like a really important thing for pushing you forward. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Well, that sounds like great, great advice. I'm curious, in your case, how important was it that Portland was the place that this happened for you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brenna: </b>Well, I mean, that's a big question because who knows <laugh>, all the places I could have been, but Portland was completely perfect for me, at that time. It was cheap and tons of awesome artists. Beautiful, you know, tons of forests everywhere. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2521.505" data-end_ts="2521.725" title="2521.505" id=c_"2521.505">__An__</span> active scene. Yeah. Portland. Portland was perfect. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And now you find yourself in New York. How is that different and how is that helping, helping you move forward? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brenna: </b>You know, I, I kept finding myself here in New York all the time. I, I was kind of going back and forth a lot and, you know, developing a lot of friendships here. Also, there was just like so much opportunity for showing, having performances and stuff here. Just, there's so many people here, <laugh>, right. And in Portland, I lived there for 10 years and, I have a great community of friends there. I see myself probably living there again, but it felt like it just bur and I felt like it was necessary to experience living in another place for a little while in our, and now seemed like a good time to do it. Our friends, who run American Medium, the gallery that we work with, they live above the gallery and there's one more apartment above them. And we always told them that when that one came open, we would come and live there for a while. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So we got a call like a year ago that it was coming open. So we were like, oh, no, no. I guess we have to move to New York. <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nobody: </b><i><laugh> </i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now that, now that you're committed, you're in. Right. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brenna: </b><laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's hilarious. That's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brenna: </b>Great. So it's been great. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Brenna, I want thank you so much for, for taking the time outta your schedule to, to talk. It was, it was great to hear about this kind of approach to getting, not only to getting, getting work out there and, and to choosing work, but also how you personally got there. That was really, really interesting. Thank you so much for your time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brenna: </b>Well, thank you so much for having me on the show. I'm really excited to be part of the archive. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>We'll catch you. We'll talk to you again soon. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brenna: </b>Alright. All

</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Many thanks to Brenna for spending the time talking about her starting story and talking about how she does the work that she does. If you have an opportunity to please check her stuff out, it's hard to say actually what her website is verbally.
