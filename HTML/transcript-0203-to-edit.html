<b>Darwin: </b>Today I get a chance to, talk to somebody whose work I've been following for a while. It's really interesting stuff. His name's Sam Battle, but you probably know him best as the person behind the video series called Look Mom, no computer. If you haven't seen it, put down the podcast. Go watch it, because you're gonna <span style="color:red" data-ts="32.925" data-end_ts="33.085" title="32.925" id=c_"32.925">__want__</span> to understand what we're talking about as we're talking through these things. It's amazing. He does a lot of really great DIY stuff. He puts himself in the path of danger sometimes, for the good of the synth community. So with that, I'm going to say hi to Sam. Hey Sam. How's it going? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam Battle (Look Mum No Computer): </b>Hello. Hello, Darwin. How are you doing? All good. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm great. Hey, thanks a lot for taking the time to talk to me and, and, taking the time out of your video schedule because you've been putting out a lot of material lately. It's really neat. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Yeah, it's been, it's been quite busy. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Yeah. I'm gonna have you start off by, telling people who might not be familiar with your work, a little bit about what it is. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Okay. So, yeah. I'm look <span style="color:red" data-ts="76.125" data-end_ts="76.325" title="76.125" id=c_"76.125">__mum__</span>, no computer. Well, my name's Sam, but look, <span style="color:red" data-ts="78.325" data-end_ts="78.485" title="78.325" id=c_"78.325">__mum__</span>, no computer. And basically I just make a lot of machines that I try to make them, you know, quite strange and a little bit out there. And then also perform music with them along with a lot of other hardware and just, yeah, music equipment in general. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, it's some crazy stuff. I know that the, the thing that caught my, my that first caught my attention in your work, it was something called a synth bike, which was somehow the perfect combination of a synthesizer and bicycle. I remember that when they came out, it like popped up on my Facebook feeds. It was on dystopia, it was all over the place. It was like, it was clearly like, you know, the universe wanted me to see this video right. <laugh> from there, then I ran across something like, Jacob's Ladder Drum Machine is one I remember. The fidget spinner, oscillator, LFO thing was another, and you just keep on coming up with these kind of improbable, but fun and funny kind of devices. What got you started on that path? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Oh, on the, on the making things, ah, so basically with electronics, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="150.245" data-end_ts="150.405" title="150.245" id=c_"150.245">__kinda__</span>, I started with circuit bending when I was about 15 or 16, I found some videos on the internet and I just went, whoa, what the heck is this stuff? <laugh>? Like, like, it was like, there was lots of people talking about, you know, making a machine do things that it wasn't supposed to do is kind of like going into another dimension or something wacky like that. And I was like, yeah, I'm up for this because I was playing guitar and I was getting bored of, you know, know those chords and playing Iron Maiden solos and all that <laugh>. So I needed a bit of a change. So, yeah, I got out, I went down to the charity shop, which I think in America is called a thrift store, but they're called charity shops over here. I dunno, <laugh>, but All Car <span style="color:red" data-ts="196.485" data-end_ts="196.725" title="196.485" id=c_"196.485">__Boot__</span> Sale. Have you heard that before? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's actually similar to what we would call a garage sale, I guess. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Yeah, yeah. So I'll go over to those and, picked up some toys, tried to mess around with them like I saw in the videos and fried them all. And it was very, it was a very sad experience because none of it worked <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The, the thing that I loved, you had actually one video in particular that's sort of like a walkthrough of your modular, and I was particularly taken by your approach to building modular. One of the things I would say that we generally see in the modular world is that it's very much kind of like a consumerist thing, right? It's like, you get on some website and you, and you go through all of the fabulous modules and you pick up a system and then you go deeply into debt to buy a whole bunch of stuff, and then you buy and sell for the rest of time. You've taken a completely different approach, which is like, I found a piece, some pieces of wood. I used them to make a case. I happened to find some scrap metal that was all uniform in size, so that's gonna be the size of my modules. And you just kind of took it from there, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Yeah, yeah. Well, I, when I started making actual proper modular <span style="color:red" data-ts="273.905" data-end_ts="274.125" title="273.905" id=c_"273.905">__sim__</span> stuff, I just had absolutely no cash, no expendable income whatsoever. So I had to find a way around of making it happen. So I just, you know, switched straight away to Beans on Toast and, went down to a load cool industrial estate where I knew there was like a, a, a sheet metal and acrylic cutting place. And I just lo and behold found loads of 20 centimeter high by 10 centimeter, like pieces of metal and plastic. So that kind of justified making modules that size, which I think was a blessing in disguise because there's lots of space to get your hands in and twist them around, and it's metric as well. So, you know, you could just put it together like Lego blocks, like loads of boxes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Now this, the size of that, that size is fairly big. So that's like, that's like almost as big as a mug, like the five U mug style stuff, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's slightly smaller than five U and I guess slightly bigger than four U. Okay. So it just sits in the middle. And I didn't even know what size, like five U and four U were <laugh> because I'd never seen them in real life. So I'd have no, absolutely no idea. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So when you're building these modules up, then are you, are you making stuff from breadboard and scratch? Are you getting, DIY PCBs that you're building out? Or are you repurposing other modules and kind of <span style="color:red" data-ts="356.805" data-end_ts="357.085" title="356.805" id=c_"356.805">__hack__</span> hacking them into your own? How do you, you know, what's behind the panel on these things? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Well, like those, all of those things that you just said. It's pretty much all of them. <span style="color:red" data-ts="366.985" data-end_ts="367.205" title="366.985" id=c_"366.985">__Ah__</span>, I mean, it mainly, it mainly started with strip <span style="color:red" data-ts="369.965" data-end_ts="370.285" title="369.965" id=c_"369.965">__board__</span> and protoboard, because I didn't even know of any websites that you could get these kits and stuff and PCB boards Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and even PCB boards, like they're a bit of a cost. So I just, I just made circuits, looked at, looked on forums and just found circuits and then adjusted them and fiddled around and mixed them all together. And then later on I was like, I started appreciating a lot of other people's designs and stuff and getting PCBs or even down to, damn, I really want that module, emailing them and kind of kindly asking for, you know, a populated Euro rack PCB that I can put behind a, large panel. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That would be important too, to try and limit the amount of surface <span style="color:red" data-ts="410.465" data-end_ts="410.885" title="410.465" id=c_"410.465">__amount__</span> soldering you'd have to do too. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's, that's the thing that kills me with your <span style="color:red" data-ts="416.045" data-end_ts="416.165" title="416.045" id=c_"416.045">__rack__</span> stuff is, is if you're doing DIY, you know, everyone just assumes well get a, get one of those little microscope things that fits on your eye and get ready for a challenge. And I'm just like, Ugh, life is too short for me to solder SMT stuff, you know, <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>I can't do it. Yeah. Yeah. I know, I mean, I, I struggle a bit, quite a bit as well, but I have, I have made some surface amount stuff and surprisingly, even though I still have the dread thinking about it at the start, it's, it's actually quite quicker. It's quite a bit quicker when you get in the, in the, in the movement of it. But still, I've made a couple of big mistakes before with those large St chips that cost Yeah. About 10 pounds each. And yeah. You know, if you fry one of those, you know, that's, that's quite an expense. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's another day of, of beans, right? Beans and bread, <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Beans <span style="color:red" data-ts="466.325" data-end_ts="466.525" title="466.325" id=c_"466.325">__and__</span> bread. Just gone down the train. <laugh> <span style="color:red" data-ts="468.715" data-end_ts="469.245" title="468.715" id=c_"468.715">__Hong Kong__</span>. In fact, that's, that's more like a week of beans and bread. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Good point. Now the other thing that I noticed when you did your walkthrough on your system is that a lot of things you, you've embedded are duos, you know, either to, to work as sort of like midi to analog converters or as like interesting timing tools or, or whatever. How did you decide to get into the Arduino thing and is that just a, a comfort area for you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Yeah. Arduino's a very much a comfort area, basically, because I've known, I've had <span style="color:red" data-ts="505.405" data-end_ts="505.605" title="505.405" id=c_"505.405">__an__</span> Arduino for about five years. I think I got the first one for Christmas, like yeah, about five years ago. And I just didn't stop. I thought it was amazing because it was like, at school we had this thing called Lego Mindstorms. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I dunno whether you know that, which is like Lego technics that you plug into your computer and it's kinda like that. And I started learning code and all that. <span style="color:red" data-ts="526.045" data-end_ts="526.285" title="526.045" id=c_"526.045">__Just__</span> jazz. I mean, I'm not, I'm by no means a coder. I dunno, I dunno anything, but I, you know, I can keep on typing away until something works. I mean, it takes, you know, a lot, lot of all-nighters to do that, scratching some heads, but you do get there eventually. And it's basically, I use them basically because you can literally just have an Arduino on a strip <span style="color:red" data-ts="544.965" data-end_ts="545.285" title="544.965" id=c_"544.965">__board__</span> behind a panel. You don't really need any of other pieces of components. So it's just a very easy way of making a module. Yeah. It's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Actually kind of convenient that a typical Arduino works on five volts. That's a pretty useful voltage. Zero to five volts is pretty useful for a lot of modular functions. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Well, it's, I mean, it's useful for most even, even, pitch based things because, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="570.285" data-end_ts="570.405" title="570.285" id=c_"570.285">__a__</span> zero to five volts that's still five octaves. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, five octave range. Now when, one of the things I noticed is when you went through your system on the video, you kind of went through the modular and that was interesting. It was all, you know, this kind of interestingly hand hacked kind of stuff. But then when you show the bigger picture of your studio, you have a couple of commercial syns. You seem to really like the Arturia interfaces, like the Beat Step Pro and stuff like that. But I also noticed MS 20 ish stuff all over the place. That seems to be one of the units that you're pretty into. What's the story with the MS 20? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Well, basically, the first ever analog symp that I got, well, basically before, before I got into analog syms, I'm from kind of an age where I didn't have a clue what they were like when I was, growing up and learning about like synthesis. The only simps that I knew even existed were on logic as a plugin. I didn't even know. And, and when I found out there was something else except for, you know, a piano and an organ and these things on the computer, it blew my mind. So on eBay, I spent ages, trying to find a, a cheap enough like analog symp, <span style="color:red" data-ts="645.285" data-end_ts="645.365" title="645.285" id=c_"645.285">__and__</span> I managed to track down a broken MS 10 uhhuh, which was great. And then I took it apart. I fixed it. I was amazed. I fixed it. <span style="color:red" data-ts="652.885" data-end_ts="653.005" title="652.885" id=c_"652.885">__I__</span> was like, whoa, <span style="color:red" data-ts="653.445" data-end_ts="653.645" title="653.445" id=c_"653.445">__it__</span> works. And then, and then after a while, it wasn't enough. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>I was like, I wish I'd have another oscillator. So I, I went to start building an MS 20 clone, made from a lot of random schematics on the internet. They weren't even MS 20 based. There was just loads of stuff as long as it looked like an MS 20 <span style="color:red" data-ts="671.725" data-end_ts="671.925" title="671.725" id=c_"671.725">__and__</span> work like an MS 20, I was kind of, you know, happy with it. But that kind of didn't really work. It was, it works, but it doesn't really work. It's very, you have to hit it few times <span style="color:red" data-ts="681.105" data-end_ts="681.325" title="681.105" id=c_"681.105">__to__</span> even stay in tune <laugh>. But, but then, yeah, and then later on, I, I finally managed to find a, MS 20 for cheap enough, because this was before the MS 20 mini came out. I think this was Oh, okay. 2012. 2012 we're talking. And, the MS 20 mini came out in what, 2013 I think. Something 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Like that. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's interesting though that that would've been the jump in because that doesn't follow the standard one volt perve pitch range. So how do you integrate that with the rest of your stuff? Or do you not bother? Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>I don't bother at the minute. The funny thing is like you can actually, which way around is it, you can actually control the MS 20 with one volts per octave. All you have to do is just attenuate <span style="color:red" data-ts="727.445" data-end_ts="727.565" title="727.445" id=c_"727.445">__it__</span>, add an attenuator. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>And it's, it's quite simple, but, you know, it's still not 100% because, you know, you've gotta be really fiddly with the fingers, but I don't tend to plug it in. I mean, I, I, I liked MS 20 stuff before I got into modular. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Really. Well, the other thing that I liked about seeing you play with the MS 20 and, and it came up in your, when you did the fidget spinner oscillator thing Yeah. Was using that, using the frequency to voltage conversion stuff, which is, you know, it doesn't work the way they imagined it to. Yeah. But it works in a pretty damn fun way, right, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Yeah. It's like, I'm trying to remember how I plugged that in. I think I was using it as an envelope follower and Yes. Like, just taking the wave that the fidget spinner was spinning out and just turning it into a bit of a pew pew. Yeah, exactly. I mean, that fidget spinner thing was so funny. Like, I, I was going to the post office and I saw 'em for sale, and I was like, I hate these damn fidget spinners. And I just thought, wait a sec. <span style="color:red" data-ts="787.365" data-end_ts="787.645" title="787.365" id=c_"787.365">__Well__</span>, I mean, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="788.305" data-end_ts="788.525" title="788.305" id=c_"788.305">__the__</span> people love them. And, so I just, bought 'em and then like a couple of days later just super glued <span style="color:red" data-ts="794.405" data-end_ts="794.445" title="794.405" id=c_"794.405">__them__</span> onto a panel and lo behold it worked. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Yeah. Well, dude, tell me, I was blown away the other day. I went over to Modular Grid. I was like relaying out one of my systems and, they kind of show this thing of like the latest modules that people have added to the system. And there you go. There was a fidget spinner module sitting right on Modular Grid. I was like, oh my God. Now he's, now he's starting to influence the world. <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b><laugh>. Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="820.865" data-end_ts="821.085" title="820.865" id=c_"820.865">__No__</span>, a friend, a friend sent me a picture of that, or a link or from Modular Grid and yeah, I was half chuffed about somebody taking the influence and doing it. And then, you know, the half is like <span style="color:red" data-ts="832.165" data-end_ts="832.445" title="832.165" id=c_"832.165">__<inaudible>__</span>. I hope, I hope nobody's bringing that out because who, who really needs a fidget spinner in their modular <laugh>. That's right. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's, I remember at one point seeing somebody had made a module like out of, the motor out of a hard drive too. So I guess there's always some reason to make something, but 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Yeah. And that, that was <span style="color:red" data-ts="852.345" data-end_ts="852.565" title="852.345" id=c_"852.345">__Gki__</span>, I think you pronounce his name. Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="854.725" data-end_ts="854.925" title="854.725" id=c_"854.725">__Yes__</span>. He's an ama that, that, he's an amazing, he's done some 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Crazy stuff. I had, I had some drum modules of his that were just inexplainable and wonderful at the same time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Were they the, sound meters that were hitting Pizo speakers or something like that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>No, it was just <span style="color:red" data-ts="869.765" data-end_ts="869.885" title="869.765" id=c_"869.765">__a__</span>, some little bizarro circuit, but, I don't know. It was, it was hilarious. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>But 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Looking at your, looking at the bigger picture of your, your system, I mean, you have all kinds of stuff. You have game boys, you've got, you know, you, you've got pedals, you actually do vocals, which kind of blows my mind. I can't imagine anyone who does electronic music actually being willing to do vocals. But there you go. You're, you're into it. You seem to sort of like, not limit yourself. I mean, what, what I thought was cool is when you were going through your synth, you had kind of this thing that was, triggered sample player for doing acapellas and different sounds. You had the bench circuitry, you had analog stuff you were doing looping. You, you seem to be willing to do like, almost anything. Well, except for the computer, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b><laugh>. Yeah. I kind of shot myself in the foot with that because I'd love to use a computer every so often. <laugh>. Yeah. Yeah. There's a, yeah, just try and do as much as I can. Like, I don't think there should be any limits or any rules, even though, like I've, I have named myself, look Mum No Computer, which is a funny story actually, because we, me and, the drummer that I've done a video with in the past, we went and played a few shows in Peterborough, <span style="color:red" data-ts="948.465" data-end_ts="948.685" title="948.465" id=c_"948.465">__or__</span> not Peterborough, in, in England. Last week we had about four or five shows, and we managed to leave the practicing and working out what the heck to do right to the last minute. We only had two days until the show started, and we were like, right, what are we gonna do? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>And, we suddenly came up very quickly with a very large problem, which was basically he has this, click that he likes, and which also has these 1, 2, 3, 4 chorus go and stuff like that. Okay. Things to remind him. So he, you know, he doesn't have to be as practiced as, you know, you have to be. Right. So you can pick up things quite quickly. But the problem with that is, you know, I can't put those into my sample player on my modular, for instance, because then I can't use the sample player for something else. And it was that kind of time where we couldn't order anything else, and I didn't want to take a synth bike apart that had one of those sample players in it and stuff like that. So we had to really badly get a laptop and use it for his click. So he had a laptop sitting next to him whilst he was playing, playing <span style="color:red" data-ts="1010.165" data-end_ts="1010.325" title="1010.165" id=c_"1010.165">__the__</span> click to him. So yeah, I'm living a lie. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yes. You're so did he have to like, hide it in a bag or something so nobody would see it? <laugh>? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1020.145" data-end_ts="1020.365" title="1020.145" id=c_"1020.145">__Oh__</span>, I, I, I felt way too guilty to be honest, right at the start of every single show I, I owned up and I said, you know, it's funny, bloody blah. 'cause yeah, the worst thing would be hiding it and then somebody finds out. Yeah, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, you could just change the name of the show. Look, mom, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1035.755" data-end_ts="1036.045" title="1035.755" id=c_"1035.755">__that__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Look, there's a, there's a computer in a bag, <laugh>, right? Can you see it? What's that? What's that? Where's Wally? Like, where, where's the, where's the Apple Mac?

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So let's talk about the performance thing, because it's hard for me to imagine a performance, except you are nice enough to post up a video of you working with a drummer doing a song. Which kind of blew my head off. It was, it was hard for me to imagine what that would be like. And there you were in full glory with your MS 20 and your Handbuilt modular and some kind of Chrome globe thing that you would go and stroke every once in a while. And, a microphone and you were, you were on it, and it was just the two of you doing a gig, which seemed like an awful lot of work. Tell me a little bit about, about performance and what that performance works look like. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Well, for a start, like, that video, it was, we did that one-off song for the video for the performance. So, at that time, all he had in his ears was a noise going into a VCA that was like sending a steady click to his ears so he could stay in time with the clock of the, simp <span style="color:red" data-ts="1111.215" data-end_ts="1111.565" title="1111.215" id=c_"1111.215">__where__</span> we ended up running that, running through that song about 10 times because we didn't practice. I kind of like made up a random riff in the morning and I kept on messing up because I forgot like where that big capacitive touch globe thing was that <laugh>, the funny thing is about that capacitive touch thing is it was working in my bedroom. Like, I was able to make it work, but when I took it to the church, which is just five minutes down my road, so I, we just took it all in the morning. It started buzzing randomly on its own <laugh>. So, so I had to gaffer tape a wire from it down to my ankle and tie it around my ankle. Oh my God. So, so it would, work <laugh> with me. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1150.185" data-end_ts="1150.405" title="1150.185" id=c_"1150.185">__Oh__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1150.405" data-end_ts="1150.645" title="1150.405" id=c_"1150.405">__Geez__</span>. So it was grounded to you, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Yeah. So it was grounded to me. So it would work. The actual gigs last week were, which was the first time we actually played proper, a proper set of gigs with drums and simps. It was just a lot more practiced. We had a, the songs we knew we were performing, and, just playing a portable modular, which is not very portable, there's still a heck of a lot of it. And there's an MS 20 and a Juno, and then a lot of pedals, and I'm singing, and then there's vocals are going into a lot of different effects like pitches and stuff like that. So there's, there's a lot of crap that we've gotta lug around, but 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, it's a lot of crap. But it's also, I watch you do that performance and, and granted it was, you know, staged at a church, but at the same time it's still just two people making a lot of noise. And you were like flying around between singing and tweaking the modular and playing other things and, and playing with the capacity of ball. It was, it looked manic at best. How do you keep that up for a whole performance? Isn't it exhausting, <laugh>? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Yeah. No, I mean, like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1216.605" data-end_ts="1216.725" title="1216.605" id=c_"1216.605">__I__</span>, we've been, we've been performing in, in and out of bands, both of us, me and the drummer for, you know, five or six years in the, in different projects. And, you know, it's a lot of practice. Like, played hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of gigs, you know, head headlined in Glasbury actually, and one of the not inner stage in Glasbury. I say the main stage, that'd be crazy. But, yeah, it just, takes a bit of, it's more about the songs and then, you know, you add a little bit of a fancy piece of technology in one of the songs and then another one in another, if you see what I mean. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure, sure. One of the things I would think of with that kind of setup and, and with sort of like the, the fluid use of technology, I, I am curious how much of this is improvisational and how much of it is really strictly measured out. 'cause you said he's using this click track that kind of tells him when to do a course and stuff. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1269.635" data-end_ts="1269.925" title="1269.635" id=c_"1269.635">__Yeah__</span>. And I can see where that's really helpful and it probably helps you because he's then through his playing, giving you cues about when you're flipping to a course or whatever. Yeah. But I would still think with all of this gear around you and you kind of like standing in the light, I would think that you have to also give yourself some leeway to be a little bit more, you know, I'm gonna, I'm gonna take a little break and just play with the big capacity ball for a while, <laugh>, or just gonna wink on the MS 20 while I try and regain my witts or something like that. Yeah. Do you give yourself much space for improv? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>It depends. There's, I've got, usually two different styles of gigs. There's usually the kind of improv DJ kind of thing where I'm just, you know, you're making, there isn't a set set of songs. You're just, you know, improvising on, on beat step pros, just you doing a live thing and live improv, and you could do whatever the heck you want then. And Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know, that's, that's one style. But, but this kind of thing, we had set songs and we had set parts, and there was a couple of parts where we were able to extend and unex <span style="color:red" data-ts="1336.485" data-end_ts="1336.645" title="1336.485" id=c_"1336.485">__extend__</span> depending our interest did the crowd <span style="color:red" data-ts="1338.845" data-end_ts="1339.125" title="1338.845" id=c_"1338.845">__wear__</span>. But it's quite set what we were doing in, in that kind of thing. It's not really a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1344.125" data-end_ts="1344.325" title="1344.125" id=c_"1344.125">__certain__</span> 'cause. Like modular and usual, traditional, modular like performances, they're very improvised and stuff. Right. But, I come from a very band, you know, song background, and I'm, I'm kind of like, try not to stick to any rules. So I'm trying to take the modular stuff with this kind of attitude. Right. And just playing, playing proper songs with it, if you see what I mean. And then there's a lot of improv times where they can sound different. You just <span style="color:red" data-ts="1369.645" data-end_ts="1369.845" title="1369.645" id=c_"1369.645">__Right__</span>. Fiddle around, plugging different things in, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But the song structure is still pretty set. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Yeah. It's pretty set. I mean, there's a couple that I said that you can extend depending how, how it plays out. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> like, like solo parts and stuff, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Because you mentioned it here, having a background, doing song oriented stuff. One of the things I like doing in my podcast is talking to people about their beginner story, their background story, and how they got to be the artists and the makers. They are. And you have such an interesting combination of things that you do. You've kind of got this hack horrific builder side to you. I would say that you have a very strong design sense and that the things that you do all kind of have a, have a through line from a design standpoint. You're a, you're a singer musician that, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1421.625" data-end_ts="1421.845" title="1421.625" id=c_"1421.625">__had__</span> an accomplished one and one with a long history in that. What's your background like that brings all of these things together? Where did you come from? Was, how did you, how did you grow up to be who you are? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>I have no idea. <laugh> joking. No, I try to work it out. Like, I came from a family where my dad was always underneath the car, like fixing things. So I think the building kind of thing came from the fact that I saw my dad building and fixing things. And I thought, yeah, I can do that. I can build stuff, you know, I can, you know, you could just, you know, be a bit thrifty with ideas. And then just the, the musical stuff, I've just been playing guitar. I'm mainly a guitarist. That's the funny thing. I finally said, bye-bye to the guitar. And look <span style="color:red" data-ts="1466.325" data-end_ts="1466.525" title="1466.325" id=c_"1466.325">__mum__</span>, no computer. But before, just, that's what I was trying to pursue is just the music career and songwriting career, because I still do every so often a lot of songwriting for other artists and that it's quite pop. So it's quite funny. But, yeah, it's just, I'm trying to do as much random stuff as I can, purely because I haven't got much of a concentration span. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Did you get any formal training in any of this stuff? Were you, whether it's electronics or music or art or any of it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>I did chemistry for about six months at Uni <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. So that explains the drugs. What <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b><laugh> funny thing is, man, I'm quite, I'm very, I'm quite straight down the line with any of that stuff. I'm very, very straight edge if, if you will. I mean, I like beer, but that's about it. But, no, I mean, I've done guitar lessons, I guess Uhhuh, <affirmative> and a couple of singing lessons at school. But with the electronics, it's merely just take stuff apart. If it breaks, that's a shame. Yeah. Yeah. Just every like, just very, curious, I guess. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So now curiosity would explain then to some of, some of the instruments that you've built. So we talked a little bit about the synth bike. We've mentioned it. And for people who haven't, who haven't seen that, could you like really quickly explain how that thing works? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Okay. Well, there's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1548.325" data-end_ts="1548.565" title="1548.325" id=c_"1548.325">__about__</span>, there's four synth bikes now, <laugh>. Oh, okay. But, yeah, yeah. I like the first, the first instance of the synth bike. I just had an epiphany on when I was on the tube buffing, like the London Underground. And it was just like, yes, this was about a year ago, I think. And I was like, yes, this sounds like a good idea. I'm gonna go and do it. And, it's basically just the main concept is you're pedaling and the quick <span style="color:red" data-ts="1570.445" data-end_ts="1570.645" title="1570.445" id=c_"1570.445">__your__</span> pedal, the quicker the music goes. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, that's it. And it's just a magnet on a wheel. Or actually the first ever <span style="color:red" data-ts="1576.325" data-end_ts="1576.645" title="1576.325" id=c_"1576.325">__synth__</span> bike, it was, it was a credit card on a wheel that was hit that was hitting a switch. <laugh> <laugh>. But yeah. And then the, I think the one that came to prominence was the one that people know the most is probably the synth bike Mark two, which is a rally chopper that has been in the family. And I've, I've built a very large, like, quite involved, beat groove machine, I guess, into the handlebars <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's just one of those things that was almost like made for getting YouTube views. Right. Yeah. It's, it's great looking. It's got a great title. The whole thing really, really kicked in. Is that, is that kind of what really kicked you into speed in terms of doing the YouTube channel? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Well, yeah, ba basically, a lot of things coincided at that point. Like, I was, like, my last band fell apart. I was in a lot of, problems with my, well, what I was planning on doing with life and stuff, and I figured I should just change it up for a year and see where I get to <laugh>. And so somebody said, oh, you should speed up on the videos. You're only doing like, one every blue moon, you know, like, one every month or something. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So now I try and do, yeah, one a week pretty much. There's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Some, some neat stuff has come out of that, that's for sure. Of all the things that you've put together, what is the one that was, that's your favorite first of all? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Ah, there's one that's coming out very soon that I think is my favorite. It's burnt my eyebrows off already, but I can't talk about it <laugh> for the stuff that are out. Like, I mean, I have to say my favorite ones are usually the ones that are still working now, and that's usually the synth bikes. They still work. I, I really <span style="color:red" data-ts="1677.685" data-end_ts="1677.925" title="1677.685" id=c_"1677.685">__like__</span> the Jacobs Ladder approach, but that really hurt my eyes. <laugh>, I kind of realized 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1682.595" data-end_ts="1682.885" title="1682.595" id=c_"1682.595">__That__</span>. I have to tell you that there are very few videos that I've ever seen that have scared me, but the one that really spooked me was you had pulled out the power converter out of the microwave, and you were like, leaning over, like getting ugh. And then your necklace like, slipped out from under your shirt and like went across the thing. And I was just like, oh my God, I'm gonna see him burn his neck off. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b><laugh>? Yeah. Oh, well, I I don't think you would've seen that because it probably wouldn't have got edited <laugh>. Yeah, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Probably 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>I've, I'd have been in hospital <span style="color:red" data-ts="1714.285" data-end_ts="1714.525" title="1714.285" id=c_"1714.285">__like__</span>, oh no. In <span style="color:red" data-ts="1715.525" data-end_ts="1715.565" title="1715.525" id=c_"1715.525">__the__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1715.565" data-end_ts="1715.765" title="1715.565" id=c_"1715.565">__board__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The police would've, the police would've seen that video, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Yeah. They'd been like, Ooh, we got a, we got a cooked, cooked man. But, yeah, I need us to say I've, there's a lot, I've had a lot of close calls and I just, I need to take, I take safety quite seriously. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But there's sometimes that I just, I, there's things that I overlook, like necklaces sometimes that has happened. I don't wear the necklace anymore when I've got a shorter necklace, actually. And it's because yeah. I don't want it hitting anything. And then yeah, frying my neck and then killing me because it probably would <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well that two, the 2000 volts sitting in a capacitor, it was that I saw that happen and I just literally jumped <span style="color:red" data-ts="1757.065" data-end_ts="1757.285" title="1757.065" id=c_"1757.065">__out__</span> of my seat that that really, yeah. That really gave me a, gave me a scare. But of the stuff that you've done, what ha what was the most ridiculous, what would you think is the most ridiculous? I think the Jacobs Ladder is up there, but you've done a lot of different things. What other like really ridiculous stuff have you done? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Well, I mean, I'm really annoyed that I can't say about this one that's coming up because it's bloody ridiculous. I think the most ridiculous <span style="color:red" data-ts="1784.965" data-end_ts="1785.245" title="1784.965" id=c_"1784.965">__right__</span> for now is most definitely the Jacobs Ladders because they're the most dangerous. But there's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1789.645" data-end_ts="1789.685" title="1789.645" id=c_"1789.645">__a__</span> several, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Several, several times. You talked about doing a bouncy castle since, did you ever, yeah. Did you ever do that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>I've got the bouncy castle. <laugh> do 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Too. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Yeah. It's really annoying because my room is slowly filling up and, I mean, I've got a very lucky situation right now. Basically, I live in, a shutdown school and it's kind of like, there's this, there's this scheme in, England, they're called guardianship schemes. And what it basically is, is a business closes down and instead of getting a security, they, let people live in it to make sure that nobody squats in it. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I was going to ask because, in your videos sometimes you get a little wide pan and you get this sense of working in a really big room and Yeah. I think it's hard for most people to imagine, especially when you kind of talk about really working off of a reduced budget, right? Yeah. It's hard to imagine, you know, most people are like, oh my God, I have to like, squeeze all my stuff into an old broom closet. You know, that's Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> the only place I get to work. And so to see you in this big spot, which is perfect for the kind of experimenting that you do, but I was wondering how that worked out. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Yeah, I mean, to be honest, it's, it's just a lot cheaper than living anywhere else, purely because the actual living, the living conditions are quite substandard, <laugh>, I mean, there's no hot water. The shower's, literally just a cubicle <span style="color:red" data-ts="1871.175" data-end_ts="1871.375" title="1871.175" id=c_"1871.175">__that__</span> like in the corner and there's no kitchen. So it's all a bit, but the most important thing to me is that I've got space to be able to create things. Right. And, the rest of it can come second to that, if you see what I mean. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Sure. So how, how quick has this setup expanded for you? So like, when we see the, when we see you kind of like surrounded by the modular and the game boys and all this kind of stuff, how long have you been building these things? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>When did 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You start that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>I think I started mainly, collect, well, building up these kind of things. The, the new kind of things they're like all of that stuff that you see, like maybe in the actual studio shot, maybe only three years, but I've been doing this for maybe six years, so it's not very long, but it's, it's quite a bit of time. And, like since I've moved into this place, which is about a year and a half ago, it's kind of like a goldfish in a bigger pond. You kind of grow into it <laugh>, which I'm very scared when, when I get kicked out of this place, which I dunno when it will happen yet. I mean, I've gotta find somewhere to put all this stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Yeah. Well, so you said that this is a school that what they just basically shut it down for a new school or something like that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>They shut it down because it was, breaking the law for some, there was some very dodgy, there's actually a panorama, about it, which is a BBC documentary series <laugh>. It's like, it's like crime watch and there's a video, but, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1960.085" data-end_ts="1960.405" title="1960.085" id=c_"1960.085">__Alright__</span>. Well that needs to be part of the story then too, is you're living in the middle of a crime watch zone. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Yeah. That's awesome. And it's closed down, but yeah, now, now I live, there's about 10 of us that live here and we've all got a classroom each, so it's pretty good. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's wild. That's really interesting. Now, one of the, one of the other things I am curious about is, and I'm curious because I think that this is something that we all kind of wonder about, which is people who are very active on YouTube and stuff, you have started, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1996.025" data-end_ts="1996.245" title="1996.025" id=c_"1996.025">__and__</span> yeah. Entity, and you're, you have support from, you have support from the user base, right? Yeah. And one of the neat things is the way that you kind of talked about how you were going to support your supporters, right? You talked about, doing a zine. You talked about potentially doing some devices for people and stuff. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, how long have you been doing the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2018.765" data-end_ts="2019.125" title="2018.765" id=c_"2018.765">__Petrin__</span> thing? First? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>I've been doing the Patreon for about six months now. And that the, I've I've quickly after that realized that the actual building things for people was, it just wasn't gonna make sense. And I had to quickly nip that in <span style="color:red" data-ts="2032.765" data-end_ts="2032.965" title="2032.765" id=c_"2032.765">__the__</span>, because it was just too <span style="color:red" data-ts="2034.145" data-end_ts="2034.365" title="2034.145" id=c_"2034.145">__car__</span> time consuming. I'm not Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I'm not very good at that. I mean, I actually, it didn't even get past the first one. It ended up, I ended up frying it, <laugh> frying the design, and I just, it was just too stressful. Like, I had too many sleepless nights trying to work out what the hell to do. I was like, oh God, I've got into deep with this one. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Well, you know what though, actually, like sending a note to your, to your supporters saying, well, I fried a circuit for you, <laugh>. That's probably, that's probably a great email to get to. That's a, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Well, yeah, I mean, I ended up, I ended up sending them their money back and stuff <span style="color:red" data-ts="2065.685" data-end_ts="2065.885" title="2065.685" id=c_"2065.685">__to__</span> feel a little bit bad about all. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Wow. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2067.945" data-end_ts="2068.165" title="2067.945" id=c_"2067.945">__And__</span> but luck, a couple of them were nice enough to say, oh man, just it's fine. <laugh>. Yeah. Which I'm very appreciative about. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, but did you, did you follow through with doing the zine? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Yeah, so I do a zine about every one to one and a half months. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> a zine comes out and the next one's about oscillators. There's just a lot of really simple things in there. It's basically just a, yeah. Keep people happy. I put a lot of songs and lots of stems and samples up on the Patreon and talk about lots of things and try and live stream. I'm trying to keep it up there because it seems like a good viable source of getting a, you know, a bit of extra money to fund projects, really. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Yeah. And I, it's why I wanted to ask, because the thing that you do, I mean, if nothing else that requires money, you have to pay for at, at the very least you have to pay for solder and panels, right? Yeah. But at some point, you know, there, you know, some of your designs <span style="color:red" data-ts="2126.825" data-end_ts="2127.045" title="2126.825" id=c_"2126.825">__and__</span> getting, getting something that's with an Arduino that's driving a bunch of outputs or an SSD card or whatever that takes, that takes time and that takes some money to do it. And I was wondering, you know, what mechanisms you, you have to support that, and I was curious about the Patreon. Does, do you feel like that's a successful means to do it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Yeah, and I'm hoping, I'm hoping that it, it will be more of a, hopefully I'm trying to work out ways of making, trying to get a bit more support from people and working out ways of doing that because it would just, it would just free up and like make it a lot less stressful and at the same time making so I can concentrate a lot more on building things. Right, right. And making, making better videos and stuff. But right now, I mean, I just, I do just a lot of, I do, some advert music, <laugh>. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> every so, and then, library music and songwriting and producing records. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's cool though, because you've got a, you've found a way to make music music a thing at a time when it's really hard to do that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Yeah, I'm just, yeah, I'm by no means, got any money, but <laugh>, you know, I, I'm lucky at a state where right now I don't have to work that much at all. So it's, it's quite good. I'm quite, I'm quite pleased to be able to concentrate quite a lot of time onto making some crazy things. <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>If you could do anything to make things easier or better or to be more productive at music, what is it that you would you would do that's different from what you're doing now? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>That's a good question, actually. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Maybe use a computer. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Yeah. Yeah. I mean I, I, I do use a computer. I'm just kidding, man. It's not <laugh>. I mean, it's not a lie. Like I, I mean my, like, whenever I'm working it's logic, logic, logic. So, and stuff like that. And whenever I do these live things, it's I record it in multi-track into a computer anyway, and then just mix it a little bit afterwards. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Have you done any releases? Have you done 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Any releases? Releases? Yeah. Not, not with look <span style="color:red" data-ts="2241.265" data-end_ts="2241.485" title="2241.265" id=c_"2241.265">__mom__</span>, no Computer? Not yet. No. No, nothing really. Just a random demo mix tape that I put up a couple of weeks ago. It's just a, just four songs that were just demos and I've got a lot of songs in the bag, but I'm just trying to work out what the heck to do with music wise. I don't have any, I'm trying to find management that know where to point me and stuff because I'm very unorganized. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I don't know though. It seems like you can't be that unorganized to, to get to be as productive as you are. You seem to, you seem to get a lot of work done, man. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Yeah, I guess. Yeah. But that's, that's down to, I mean, I get obsessive and the problem with obsessive is you can't concentrate on anything else until one thing's finished. So. Right. You know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>As far as your music goes, I mean, one of the things we hear a lot in the videos is your, your music tends to sort of have an industrial edge to it. I would say. Yeah. But, also little touches of EDM, is that what you would consider sort of like the, the music in your head? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>I dunno, really. That's a, that's a, that's a good question because I don't tend to listen to electronic music, surprisingly <laugh>. So, I like, I just kind of of make whatever's coming out. I have, I don't really think like try and make something sound like something <span style="color:red" data-ts="2320.725" data-end_ts="2320.925" title="2320.725" id=c_"2320.725">__and__</span> kind of just do it until it sounds right, I guess <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure, sure. That's, that's interesting though, because actually that, that seems to align with a bunch of other stuff because if you take a look at your modular rig, it's not really like the typical voicing of everyone else's modular rig. Right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And it kind of sounds like a lot of times you didn't really give a crap what anyone else was doing. You just, you know, between the combination of what, what you could get your hands on and what you were interested in, you just followed that. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Yeah. Just, just get on with 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It. It's like musically, you happen to have electronic instruments at hand, so you're doing electronic music, you don't feel like you have to necessarily run around and sound like either, orbital or skinny puppy. You're just doing whatever's inside your head. And that seems like a pretty, like, it seems like your whole life is kind of aligning towards this thing of where I just, I just have a way I want to do it and I'm gonna do it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Yeah. I mean, I dunno what that way is because it's somewhere in my, somewhere in my brain, but that part of the brain isn't talking to the other part of the brain <laugh>. So, I'm just, I'm just letting it do it, do its thing, if you know what I mean. <laugh>. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So what are, what do you imagine for the future then? What do you think is then are the next turns? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Oh man, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Obviously you're gonna continue doing the videos. It sounds like you've got some great plans ahead for that. Do, what else do you want to try and accomplish? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Oh, well, I, I feel bad about not being able to reveal that, that crazy dangerous one. But I've, I've just, just in the short term, I've got, I've got a Nokia 33 10 synth being made right now. I'm building it <span style="color:red" data-ts="2422.705" data-end_ts="2422.825" title="2422.705" id=c_"2422.705">__up__</span>. That's gonna be quite amazing. But that's not for future stuff. I'm looking forward to that. And, and 150 oscillator synth, that's gonna be quite bolick <laugh>. I haven't, I'm making that, I'm making that <span style="color:red" data-ts="2432.865" data-end_ts="2433.025" title="2432.865" id=c_"2432.865">__of__</span> a minute. Like, I've been, I was breadboarding it just as you called. So the future, it's a, it's a strange one. I would love to just, be able to, I mean, like a dream, like anybody is just, you know, just keep on making crazy stuff and hopefully it's a logarithmic curve and it just gets crazier and more outlandish since I've only been doing it for a year, looking in next year, hopefully I'll look back and there'll be just a heck of a lot more interesting pieces of art. And I'm not really, I, I wouldn't consider myself an artist, but, but maybe being, you know, getting some in some exhibitions or something might be cool. Yeah. And also playing the music. I mean, I'll just, my, I've never been successful at it yet, but just having some sort of successful release would be great. <laugh>. Right. So like, trying to build it all and getting the music going, and then also just having a, some funny videos that make, make people laugh, I guess. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I think it's funny that you say that you don't necessarily consider yourself an artist. 'cause when I take a look at the, like, the broad picture of your work, that's exactly how I think of you. Okay. I think of you an artist and your art happens to be a bunch of different kind of related things, but it, it really kind of has a voice that's kind of unique to you, which is sort of like the heart of being an artist, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Yeah. Yeah. I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2510.445" data-end_ts="2510.645" title="2510.445" id=c_"2510.445">__guess__</span>. I guess so. I mean, like, I always thought I was a musician and yeah, I've <span style="color:red" data-ts="2515.445" data-end_ts="2515.565" title="2515.445" id=c_"2515.445">__read__</span> recently. I, I guess it is expressing myself as an artist. I mean, my, my girlfriend, she's a, she's an artist and she does artist art. She's doing a PhD in, in fine art, but with a process of astronomy and, focus. Oh. But, but that's like, I, I never feel like an artist when I'm with her because she's doing it properly. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2536.045" data-end_ts="2536.165" title="2536.045" id=c_"2536.045">__Yeah__</span>, right, right. There you go. So, I dunno whether I should call myself one <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I got it. Sure. Well, but, but you know, the one question I have then, given, given the kind of thing you do, do you ever worry about like, running out of ideas? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>No, because when I, I always find myself like, whenever I'm in a time of doubt, like, I'm like, oh God, I've done, like, what have I done for the last year? And I'm running out of ideas. I always suddenly after that, I always come up with an idea. <laugh>, I, I tell, I tell you the best way of doing it. I, I, I call it the epiphany shower. You, you feel like you've got no ideas left, and then you go in the shower and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2572.485" data-end_ts="2572.605" title="2572.485" id=c_"2572.485">__then__</span> suddenly, boom, there's an idea, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, that's great. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>So hopefully not. We'll see. You never know. It might happen. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well keep on taking them showers, man. It sounds like a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2583.605" data-end_ts="2583.725" title="2583.605" id=c_"2583.605">__way__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b><laugh> be clean and full of ideas, clean 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And full of ideas. It's the perfect combo. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Yeah. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, Sam, I want to thank you so much for the time. It's, it's been great, great chatting with you and great hearing more about, both, both your ideas, but your approach to things. It's really, it's really cool and you know, hopefully we can get people, digging your stuff. What's the best, other than just looking for, look <span style="color:red" data-ts="2610.545" data-end_ts="2610.765" title="2610.545" id=c_"2610.545">__mom__</span>, no computer on YouTube. Where else would you like to send people?

</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Well, it'd be amazing because yeah, just the, the, the more people would mean just the more ability to make more crazy stuff. <laugh>. Indeed. But that'll be, that is just patreon.com/look, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2644.505" data-end_ts="2644.725" title="2644.505" id=c_"2644.505">__mom__</span>, no computer.
