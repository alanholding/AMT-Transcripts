<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Just a quick note on the front end. If you haven't heard already, we're running a little Kickstarter campaign on trying to get us, a new microphone <span style="color:red" data-ts="19.605" data-end_ts="19.765" title="19.605" id=c_"19.605">__or__</span> Mike <span style="color:red" data-ts="19.885" data-end_ts="20.165" title="19.885" id=c_"19.885">__Priest__</span>. So if you could help out, just check the show notes or check <span style="color:red" data-ts="23.245" data-end_ts="23.485" title="23.245" id=c_"23.245">__head__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="23.485" data-end_ts="24.325" title="23.485" id=c_"23.485">__starter.com__</span> and do the normal searches. You'll find us. With that, I bring you Rob ick. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today I have the great pleasure of getting a chance to talk to somebody who's, really intriguing to me. His name's Rob Hodi, and he is a synth designer that has a very sneaky, strong reputation in the synth community. He's, been involved in stuff that's a little DIY oriented, but he also, developed synths for sale. And everybody, when I talk to people that have his senses, they talk about him as being like desert island, syns, the kind of things that they would, they could spend their life on. And so whenever I hear that, I get really excited about talking to the designer. And so that's what I get to do today. So I'll stop talking and let's talk to Rob himself. Hey Rob, how are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rob Hordijk: </b>Hi. I'm fine, thank you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, thank you so much for taking time out of your schedule to talk to me. I really appreciate it. Let's start off by having you talk a little bit about what your work looks like right now. What kind of things are you doing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rob: </b>Well, basically I'm building modular synthesizers. There's a long waiting list, so, I have a lot of, lot of work for the future building all that are in order. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. How long is, just for argument's sake, about how long is the waiting list in terms of years? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rob: </b>Wow. It's like one and a half <span style="color:red" data-ts="115.045" data-end_ts="115.285" title="115.045" id=c_"115.045">__year__</span> or something. Wow. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's something else I'll tell you. Congratulations on the work that you do, because like I said, everybody that has yours set up, just treats it like it's their most prized possession. A lot of 'em talk about it almost like it's their child. Right. It's pretty fun. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rob: </b>Yeah. Well, thank you for the compliments. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Now, one of the kind of tenets of your design is a circuit that is really unique that you named the Wrangler, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rob: </b>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Can you explain a little bit what that is? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rob: </b>Well, first it's, it's maybe better to say that basically I design electronic music, instruments, and there are several parts that make up an instruments, and one of them is the Wrangler, but there are many other parts that are necessary to make it into a complete instrument. So myself, I like to look at it as, basically I developed a design method, and this design method basically starts with a concept. And in this concept, you, think of things like economic issues, specific mechanical technical kind of issues, but also, of course the purpose, what the instrument will be for. And, so basically from this, this conceptual design comes like a functional design that, gives a list of all the functions that would fit that particular concept. Then in the next stage, you'll find the, proper algorithms for these functions. And then you implement these functions in hardware or software or whatever fits the concept. And then eventually there is a, a synthesizer, new synthesizer, uhhuh 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative>. Right. That's a very thoughtful way of going through it. And it does point to something that is really clear, which is that despite the fact that mod a modular synthesizer can be kind of pieces that are combined at people's whim, it does seem that you put effort into designing a system rather than just individual modules. Would you say that's true? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rob: </b>That is, that is totally correct, and that is, also because I, I believe in musical instruments. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So, when I started with the modular synthesizers, building them some <span style="color:red" data-ts="263.545" data-end_ts="263.765" title="263.545" id=c_"263.545">__10__</span>, 12 years ago, then I was thinking who at this moment would actually want to use a modular synthesizer? I didn't really think that keyboard players would be interested because, having to atch a synthesizer on stage is not a very, convenient, situation. <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rob: </b>Yeah. So basically more, our thinking that people that wanna do sequencing and are into the more abstract kind of electronic music would be interested in, in modular synthesis. But for me, a modular synthesizer is not really about modules, but it is basically about modulations. Because the one thing that makes a modular synthesizer different from other types of synthesizers, like, keyboard synthesizers, monophonic or polyphonic or whatever, is that with a modular synthesizer, you basically can modulate everything with everything. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rob: </b>And that is the one most important feature of a modular synthesizer. And in that sense, I think that modulations are more important than modules. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rob: </b>Yeah. And so, because the question is also what, what exactly is a module? It is very hard to define a module. You can say, well, a module, there's only one very simple musical function, like it generates a pitch or it controls, the amplitude. But these days, if you look at all the modules that are out there, especially, in, in the Euro <span style="color:red" data-ts="361.385" data-end_ts="361.605" title="361.385" id=c_"361.385">__rec__</span> world, then you see that these modules are more like little systems themselves after. Right. So the whole I original idea of modules, I, I don't think is, is the good starting point. I think that the better starting point is the idea of, of being able to modulate everything with everything. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, and it's interesting because, you know, I hadn't thought about it that way before, but you are right. Which is that in, especially in the eurorack world, what you see is people get really excited by the module rather than the interaction of modules. And so that's why you get some of these modules that tend to be, I mean, it, it may as well be a Roland keyboard just behind the modular panel because there's very few patch points and a whole lot of menus. So one of the things I'm curious about is the development of some of the things beyond modules. So one <laugh>, one of the instruments that you designed that really tickled me, was a thing called a blip poo box. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rob: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="428.595" data-end_ts="428.885" title="428.595" id=c_"428.595">__Yeah__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That is that, the right name, right pronunciation for it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rob: </b>Yeah, that's fine. BLE box. Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. What that is fascinating because I've always felt like these, you know, a small self-contained unit can be fun because it's easily portable and it, and it, and there's something cute about it, but so often they have very conservative routings and modulations. That seems to be the opposite case in the blip poo box. Right. Which it seems like it's all oriented around modulation and more than almost any other function. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rob: </b>Yeah. Well, there is a, a basically a very long history before this, blipper box of ideas. And, first of all, I like to build what I call myself a patch in a box, which is basically a very simple, kind of, structure, but that structure produces something that is, that does not necessarily sound like a monophonic keyboard synthesizer, or doesn't even have to be based on things like melody, harmony, rhythm, et cetera, et cetera, but is more like a sort of a, a box that, that produces a sort of <span style="color:red" data-ts="501.285" data-end_ts="501.405" title="501.285" id=c_"501.285">__a__</span> abstract soundscape and has sort of a life of its own, but you can influence it. And that's just a fun thing to do. It, it is a little pleasure of mine to build these kind of boxes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's really interesting. Now, one of the things I would say is that for all, for all the people I've seen or interacted with that use your systems and your, whether it's modules or other devices, I am not sure that I ever saw anyone ever hook up a keyboard to it. It seems like maybe even more so than ula, you've sort of like gone a completely different way. Now, you said that when you started your designs, you figured this wouldn't be something that would be of interest to Keyboardists, but somehow your design like draws people into just controlling it via its own knobs. How did you make the design choice that would drive people in that direction? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rob: </b>Well, for these sort of patch in a box kind of things, they are not really designed for musicians, actually, I call them, with a, <span style="color:red" data-ts="567.085" data-end_ts="567.205" title="567.085" id=c_"567.085">__with__</span> a French call, ob jetar, uhhuh 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rob: </b>Basically, it is a little object all by itself, and I like it to have a sort of a mysterious kind of thing. It does things, but it is a bit unclear what it does, but you can sort of make it do different things and, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="588.885" data-end_ts="589.165" title="588.885" id=c_"588.885">__they__</span> should, it should be able to do many things. And it's not specifically with musicians in mind. And, for instance, when I designed this Blipper box, I first made four, and, I had no idea what to do with them. I showed them to a couple of friends and they said, oh, I like it. Can I have one? Maybe you build some more. And, so that's basically the way how these things starts. But I have a lot of friends that are in sort of like this improv scene and <span style="color:red" data-ts="619.815" data-end_ts="620.165" title="619.815" id=c_"619.815">__noise__</span> scene, et cetera, et cetera. Right. And they seem to do very interesting things with them. I think I built like 160 of these blipper boxes. Really. I was at a event a couple of weeks ago where there were three people performing within their performance, set up a Blipper box. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, that's cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rob: </b>It had, it was quite fun. But I remember when I, when I first built them, I think some 10 years ago or something, the first I just, took a couple to, I was, I was visiting some friends in the Bay Area, and I took a couple with me, and I, I left some there with people and, but these were basically more people like, like in, in the improv jazz scene, and they like them very much. And, and so I asked, so what is it about this BLIP <span style="color:red" data-ts="669.485" data-end_ts="669.685" title="669.485" id=c_"669.485">__book__</span> box? Why, why do you like it? And they said, well, basically we like to play with electronics, but we don't want these devices that have menus that you have to <span style="color:red" data-ts="680.355" data-end_ts="680.645" title="680.355" id=c_"680.355">__wait__</span> through and things like that. And this box is very simple. There is 12 knobs, there's nothing else, just an output, and you just dial up some sounds and it can do a lot of different types of sounds. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rob: </b>So you just dial up a sound and it starts producing all these little blips and clicks and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And then you take your instrument, maybe a saxophone or a trumpet or whatever, and you improvise along with it. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I thought, well, that is a very valid way of using a blipper box. Yeah. But when I, when I build these boxes, it's, I don't really have those kind of things in mind. The, the modular system that I built, which is basically my main work. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, because these <span style="color:red" data-ts="723.485" data-end_ts="723.725" title="723.485" id=c_"723.485">__clip__</span> are more like little extras. Those are specifically designed with specific musical purposes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. One of the things that's kind of a tenant though of your work is that you sort of embrace chaos in at least some of your generating functions. Right. That seems to be a really important part of your system design. Would you say that that's true? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rob: </b>Yeah. And that is because if you want to give behavior to a box, if you make a box or a function that has its own kind of behavior, well, I got, I got interested in chaos theory way back in the eighties of the last century and studied it. And in those days it was more about graphic functions and little pictures, but I was curious about how to apply them to music. I remember, I, I tried these sort of chaos functions with sound, but mostly that was a bit disappointing until I found a couple of tricks that actually sort of work out musically and can give a piece of electronics, sort of like a behavior of itself, like <span style="color:red" data-ts="792.765" data-end_ts="792.885" title="792.765" id=c_"792.765">__a__</span>, a bit like it's life. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and, and chaos, theory is basically the best way that I have found to go about. So chaos is different from randomness because randomness is just totally random, but chaos basically means that it is a, a system with a certain complexity, but this complexity is basically too complex for the human mind to sort of, grasp. But with, with a bit of luck, it behaves like things in nature behave because we find this chaos theory back in nature, in basically in everything. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I think it's a good thing to point out the difference between chaos and random, because I think a lot of people just assume, well, if I need chaotic behavior, I can just sample and hold a noise thing, and there's my chaos. And in fact, one of the sort of, kind of like easy definitions I one time heard of in, in terms of chaos, is that it's a, it's a function where the, the pattern that's created is too complex for our brains to see as a pattern, right. Because our brains kinda work like pattern recognition devices. But once <span style="color:red" data-ts="867.365" data-end_ts="867.485" title="867.365" id=c_"867.365">__a__</span>, once a thing gets too difficult, it's, it's hard for us to track it in that way, you know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rob: </b>A chaotic system, it's a bit like a servo system, but a servo system has one state that it always wants to go to. But a chaotic system basically has several of these states, sometimes an unlimited amount of states. And so the, the trick of a chaotic system is that it sort of, if you just get it a bit out of balance, it has a <span style="color:red" data-ts="897.605" data-end_ts="897.845" title="897.605" id=c_"897.605">__shorten__</span> a a short time of almost random behavior, and then it gets stuck in a pattern. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And that is basically a balanced state. It's the, <span style="color:red" data-ts="907.405" data-end_ts="907.525" title="907.405" id=c_"907.405">__what__</span> they call a strange attractor. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Then when you sort of disturb the, this balance, it will move to another state, another balanced state. And the way that these balance states can be used musically is when they sort of create little patterns. And if the, these patterns are relatively short, like, like between, four or to 40 steps or something, so short enough for us to recognize as a repeating pattern Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, then, then it, it's very useful musically. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rob: </b>And these patterns, these new patterns don't have to have the same length very often. They, they, they double in length or they're half in length, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="955.195" data-end_ts="955.485" title="955.195" id=c_"955.195">__this__</span> thing that they call bifurcations. And, and then if you can make a, like a system that now and then disturbs itself, it, it becomes like a system that can do something for maybe one hour, the same thing, but then <span style="color:red" data-ts="973.565" data-end_ts="973.845" title="973.565" id=c_"973.565">__certainly__</span> after an hour, it completely changes its behavior. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It almost, it's, it's almost like it gets tired and tired of doing that and does something else. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rob: </b>Yeah. And that's just incredible fun to play with. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, indeed. Well, the other thing is then too, when you're working with these chaotic systems, very small changes in the in control settings will have really extraordinary changes in the result, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rob: </b>Yep. That's possible. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So the question is then how do, how do you decide the balance between something that's chaotic enough to be interesting, but still kind of controllable enough to be musical in some way an an instrument? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rob: </b>Well, the trick that I find out myself that works well is if you make a sort of a, what I call a balanced system. That is, that is when you have, so for instance, this, there's another project I did, which is called Benin Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, which is a typical example of such a system. It has four components, basically two oscillators and a filter, the third component. And then the fourth component is some sort of function that creates an interference between the two oscillators. And this interference is basically a, a pattern, a control voltage pattern. And what you then do is you feed back this control voltage pattern into the pitches of the oscillators and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1074.105" data-end_ts="1074.325" title="1074.105" id=c_"1074.105">__to__</span> the cutoff of the filter. And there you are. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see. Right. So then it's almost like watching the output and then tweaking the, tweaking the input to keep things sort of under control. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rob: </b>Yeah. And then basically this fourth function that creates some interference between two sources. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, that is where you can vary, enormously. I very much like to use a circuit that's based on what they call a shift register, because it's very simple and cheap circuit that basically is controlled by two sources and can basically produce a stepped control voltage on its outputs. When you take several of the outputs to connect them to a digital, to analog converter, you have to sort of minimize the number of steps and the number of control voltage levels. If you keep the control voltage levels to maybe like five to eight levels. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, then it tends to sort of automatically get into interesting pattern kind of stuff. If you would make a, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1142.285" data-end_ts="1142.405" title="1142.285" id=c_"1142.285">__a__</span> digital to analog converter, that would produce, maybe 256 levels or 65,000 levels, then it doesn't really work that way anymore. So it is sort of like you have to find the right balance between complexity and simplicity. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Your thoughtfulness behind the development of these instruments is, really interesting and, and really inspiring. Can you tell me a little bit about your background? What is both your musical and your technical background that got you to the point where you can speak so eloquently about both sides of that equation? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rob: </b>I'm basically trained as a designer, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1183.865" data-end_ts="1184.085" title="1183.865" id=c_"1183.865">__and__</span> not a musician in my background, but that goes way back, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1187.805" data-end_ts="1188.045" title="1187.805" id=c_"1187.805">__till__</span> the seventies of the last century is basically in art. But in those days, I was quite interested in the idea of sound as a material to be sculpted in the same way that you can sculpt wood and metal. And I was sort of thinking like, why, you know, sound is interesting if you don't look it from a musical point of view, but more because sound is always around us, and there's many, many, many sounds, of course, I I am not the first to think these things because many composers have been thinking about this in the last century. And then you can basically go to <span style="color:red" data-ts="1225.605" data-end_ts="1225.845" title="1225.605" id=c_"1225.605">__wave__</span>, you can make like mechanical objects that makes all sorts of sounds. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, or you can make electronic objects that make all sorts of sounds. But what I like about the electronic objects is that, you don't see what makes the sound <laugh>, which you do with the mechanical <span style="color:red" data-ts="1247.285" data-end_ts="1247.605" title="1247.285" id=c_"1247.285">__options__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Of course. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rob: </b>It opens a way to sort of make it a bit mysterious how the sounds come about. Yeah. I, I remember like, like in the seventies and the late 70, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1258.765" data-end_ts="1258.885" title="1258.765" id=c_"1258.765">__I__</span> very much inspired, for instance, by the work of Brian Eno that was releasing those ambient records, basically being sort of the first to do that, and also sort of making that kind of electronic abstract electronic music popular amongst young people in those days that were mostly into rock and roll and that kind of thing. Right. And, so I've been looking more like to electronic music, like a bit like how you would look at abstract painting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rob: </b>So more <span style="color:red" data-ts="1295.485" data-end_ts="1295.605" title="1295.485" id=c_"1295.485">__a__</span> sort of combination with art, because I've always wondered why art and music are quite separate <span style="color:red" data-ts="1302.095" data-end_ts="1302.445" title="1302.095" id=c_"1302.095">__world__</span> worlds. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You know, it's funny that you say that because I used to work at a university and I was actually like a sound arts professor in the art department, but they literally had, in the university, the art department was on one side of the university, and the music department was completely on the other side of the university, <laugh>. It was like they wanted to keep 'em apart, like, you know, something bad might happen if we got these people together. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rob: </b>Of course, there have been attempts of sort of putting those worlds together, like, the futurists from Italy and the, the beginning of the 20th century Luigi or solo and the Ru Maori and, and things like that where basically music and art were sort of try to put together. And, there's been many other attempts, but somehow these, the music world and the art world sort of, yeah. Like, like to be separated. Yeah. But I don't know why that is. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I don't either, quite frankly. So I'm curious then, if with your background in art, how did you get to be comfortable enough with electronics to be building your own gear? Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rob: </b>I was interested in electronics from a very early age on, basically in the, I remember I was born in 58, so in the sixties we still had these radios with tubes. And as a kid, I was totally fascinated by these radios. I always wanted, to, look in the back when it was on and see the tubes glow and, and I wanted to know how it worked. And so I already started to play with electronics, 12 years old or something. Something very good happened to me because my father noticed that I was interested in electronics. And I think when I was like 14 years, he gave me this, subscription course in electronics that would lead to this examination for getting a license to operate a ham radio. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rob: </b>So when I was 15, I actually did the examination and succeeded. And so already at that age, I knew what tubes did, I knew what transistors did. I knew about waves and modulation systems and things like that. The things that you would learn, to get that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1448.485" data-end_ts="1448.805" title="1448.485" id=c_"1448.485">__hammer__</span> radio operator license. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So then around 90, 80, you got all these, synthesizer chips, like the Curtis chips that were freely available on the electronic shop, at the corner and little microcontrollers and processors. And I was, just more as a personal interest, not really having the idea to, to make it into a profession, but just as an interest and I learned about it stuff in those days. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And later in the eighties, I also, after having finished art school, I actually, did 11 years of study in, information technology. So basically I became a, system designer Oh, okay. Assistant designer and learned about methods and, and how to, to design stuff and how to make inventories of what you want, and God knows what <laugh> everything that you need to build an information system. But that applies also to synthesizes. So it's, it's sort of like a mixture of I know about art, I know about, systems, I know about electronics. Yeah. And then the only thing that you can do is design synthesizers. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Yeah. If that's, if that's your, your three cornered career, I guess that does put you into synthesizer design, doesn't it? Let's talk a little bit about your, about the systems that you do build. So you, first of all, one of the things I think that would surprise many people if they heard what the work was first, I think they would often be surprised if they'd see it and see that it looks almost like an old style Moog system, even though from a sound standpoint, it sounds like it should be more of a west coast. You know, I almost hate to talk about it in those terms, but I will. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, it has a, it, it seems like it should, you know, be more <inaudible> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1569.885" data-end_ts="1570.085" title="1569.885" id=c_"1569.885">__like__</span>. Is there, what is it about the design that, that drew you towards that five <span style="color:red" data-ts="1576.325" data-end_ts="1576.445" title="1576.325" id=c_"1576.325">__u__</span> kind of look in sizing and all that stuff? What, what did, what drew you into that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rob: </b>I can, I can comment a bit on this east coast, west coast thing, because very often <span style="color:red" data-ts="1588.285" data-end_ts="1588.405" title="1588.285" id=c_"1588.285">__I__</span>, I get the question, is your system east coast or West coast? And then I say, well, it's Dutch West Coast <laugh>. That's what it is. It has nothing to do with American East Coast or West Coast. It's Dutch West Coast, <laugh> <laugh>. Basically, you start, you start with a concept, and in this concept, economic aspects are important. And, now my first synthesizer was a an A MS Putney a long time ago. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. These A MS Putney, they have one really, nice thing about them that is, that if you sit before <span style="color:red" data-ts="1630.285" data-end_ts="1630.405" title="1630.285" id=c_"1630.285">__A__</span> A MS Putney, it is very comfortable to, to play. You have, a lot of space between the knobs. You, you have <span style="color:red" data-ts="1639.005" data-end_ts="1639.245" title="1639.005" id=c_"1639.005">__this__</span> little pins. It's, it's, you have a very good overview of what is happening. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rob: </b>The idea that a system also needs to be comfortable to play is, in my opinion, very important. Right. The, I remember I bought a fer system, I think around the year in 1991 of these A 100 systems, although actually I like the sound very much, that was not a problem, but economically it was a disaster. Right? I, I, I always said that my fingers were too thick for the system <laugh>, because you have to sort of get your fingers in between lots and lots of cables to relatively very small knobs. And, and I must say that those systems from those days from <span style="color:red" data-ts="1686.365" data-end_ts="1686.565" title="1686.365" id=c_"1686.365">__dub__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1686.565" data-end_ts="1686.765" title="1686.565" id=c_"1686.565">__for__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1686.765" data-end_ts="1686.965" title="1686.765" id=c_"1686.765">__day__</span>, the connectors weren't really very reliable. So it, it was, it was basically held to play. It was very uncomfortable. I, I thought now if you compare that to, like, like a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1700.125" data-end_ts="1700.325" title="1700.125" id=c_"1700.125">__Cindy__</span> or a Putney, then in comfort, that is such an enormous difference, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rob: </b>So comfort is, is important, and that's the agronomic aspects of the, of the design. So, the certain point you can come up with a, with a, with a sort of a form factor yourself that is based on, on comfort, but I felt like, well, it's, it's not a bad idea maybe to make it look like a sort of a traditional much less synthesizer, and why not use these panel sizes that mo and.com and MOTM, et cetera, et cetera, we're using so that basically maybe it's possible to, combine with module from other brands, et cetera, et cetera. The comfort of playing is, in my opinion, much, much better with the somewhat larger systems. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and in your case, not only is it that they're larger and you have more room around the knobs, but also you made the decision to bring all the connectors to the bottom of the module so that they don't interfere with you controlling, and it, and it really makes sense when you consider that so much of working with one of your systems is controlling it through the knobs rather than through a keyboard or a midi interface, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rob: </b>Yeah. But that is because I designed, a system where basically you can modulate everything with everything. All the signal levels are optimized to work with each other. It doesn't matter if you modulate at a very slow LFO rate or at audio rate or move an oscillator pitch from an LFO range to an audio range. That means that these connectors, well, basically I had this idea of making sort of like modules, but these days <span style="color:red" data-ts="1812.845" data-end_ts="1812.965" title="1812.845" id=c_"1812.845">__I__</span> actually <span style="color:red" data-ts="1813.165" data-end_ts="1813.405" title="1813.165" id=c_"1813.165">__sort__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1813.405" data-end_ts="1813.685" title="1813.405" id=c_"1813.405">__call__</span> them sections. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1815.005" data-end_ts="1815.245" title="1815.005" id=c_"1815.005">__because__</span> maybe that's a better name. Maybe one day we should get rid of this word module, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1820.985" data-end_ts="1821.205" title="1820.985" id=c_"1820.985">__but__</span> <laugh>, but for now, we still talk module synthesizes, but my, for myself, I sort of call it sections. So I had this idea of sort of grouping eight knobs with 10 connectors, because that is quite easy to build. Basically the, the mechanical way to build them is that there is, A PCB with eight bots, and behind that PCB is A PCB with all the active components that do all the functions. And these are connected with flat cables, and then flat cables go to PCBs with connectors that are mounted under these PCBs. And that way it's relatively easy to assemble. I need certain parts to sort of mechanical parts to, to hold everything together. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But that can make them the same for every section, and that way it's more easy to build. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. But now you've also kind of like set yourself up to say that whatever algorithm that you do has like eight knobs and a certain number of JAKs, do you ever find that that limits you from doing what you want to do with, with one of the modules? Or is it the kind of constraint that helps focus you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rob: </b>It is, often a good idea if you design something to, impose a certain limitation upon yourself. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> basically the way how, how I design is that, that first I go wild and I go complex until I feel that I've hit some good stuff and then I simplify. And this process of simplification that is actually, quite important because maybe I have, designed that, that would could have like 14 knobs and 18 connectors, and then by sort of simplifying it back to eight knobs and 10 connectors with the most important functions, that actually tends to add strength to the, to the design. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rob: </b>Yeah. So basically every knob is sort of equally important. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, while the extra knobs that I skipped were probably the less important knobs. Knobs that maybe do just a little, but not much. Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative>, do you ever have find yourself like finding the ways to make a single knob do the work that originally three knobs were doing, like by collapsing the function into one turn? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rob: </b>Well, for instance, well, there are of course many, many sort of tricks to simplify things. And one of the things, for instance is if you make a mixer, if you need to mix two signals, then you can make a do <span style="color:red" data-ts="1989.805" data-end_ts="1990.005" title="1989.805" id=c_"1989.805">__not__</span> mixer with a n level up for every, for each signal. But you can also make a cross fader that works with one knob. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, which is simpler, but going that direction actually gives you a new perspective because then if you have one knob, then it's probably also easier to modulate that one knob with one cv. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> the moddable mixer. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's a really great example because I mean, also the other thing that happens is when you bring in the function of a cross fader, there's this implied function that if you're bringing one thing forward, the other thing is going to the back. Right. And that is, it's a design choice that you're helping to establish by putting together this kind of interaction with it. Now, when you're developing the algorithms themselves, do you intellectualize them first and then make circuitry? Or do you get really large ideas, put together some circuitry and then see what happens? How much of it is chaotic for you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rob: </b>Well, actually thinking in, in terms of algorithms is on a sort of an abstract layer. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> all by itself. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> because an algorithm, it's a bit like a recipe for a meal. An algorithm is just a very, a description of a efficient way to do something. And the choice how to implement that algorithm comes after the algorithm is fully worked out, because then you may think that, oh, maybe it's better to use analog electronics or digital electronics or maybe even mechanical solutions. But algorithms is, is, well, if you work with sound, then you work with waves and, and waveforms and, and wave phenomena. And so there is a lot of mathematics about how to deal with waves and stuff like that. So basically the algorithms are mathematic and I, not a mathematician, but I know enough of the mathematics behind all these wave phenomenon to be able to sort of figure out algorithms. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rob: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So, last night I had a conversation with someone about filters. Many people don't realize it, but what you actually do <span style="color:red" data-ts="2140.265" data-end_ts="2140.485" title="2140.265" id=c_"2140.265">__is__</span> to, to get a filter function is you don't, first what you start to do is to create face shifts and face shift your, your signal, and then basically by combination of the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2151.565" data-end_ts="2151.845" title="2151.565" id=c_"2151.565">__face__</span> shifted signal with the original signal, you get cancellations of frequencies in certain bands. And that basically gives you the filter function. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So to create a filter is, is not like take a couple of components and glue them together. And that's a filter. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2170.065" data-end_ts="2170.285" title="2170.065" id=c_"2170.065">__Now__</span> basically there is an algorithm behind it, and that algorithm is based on, on solid mathematical stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Principles. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rob: </b>But luckily the mathematics are not really that complex. It's, it's all basically Newtonian mathematics, figured out three, 400 years ago. So it's not, it's not, quantum mechanics, luckily <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Yeah. I hear you. So Rob, our time is just about up, but before we go, I would like to talk a little bit about, you mentioned before a little bit about the pendulum. Now that that is actually the, I think it's like about the only design that's commercially of yours that's commercially available in <span style="color:red" data-ts="2212.805" data-end_ts="2213.045" title="2212.805" id=c_"2212.805">__your__</span> Iraq. Is that correct? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rob: </b>Yeah. Basically the Benin is a doit yourself. It's my gift to the doit yourself community. Okay. So there is, schematics and PCB layouts just, freely available on the internet. And, and originally it was, it started as a workshop. I remember visiting one of these circuit band festivals and having a couple of, interesting conversations with people about electronic kits and that many, that there are many electronic kits sold, but most probably most end up unbuilt on a shelf somewhere in the cupboard. Right. Then I had this idea, well, maybe it is an interesting idea to offer a workshop where people actually in a controlled environment, build a do <span style="color:red" data-ts="2261.525" data-end_ts="2261.685" title="2261.525" id=c_"2261.525">__it__</span> yourself project and for the first time and do some soldering and stuff. And then if they have done it successfully in the workshop, then maybe later when they go home and see these <span style="color:red" data-ts="2274.165" data-end_ts="2274.445" title="2274.165" id=c_"2274.165">__kids__</span> that they bought, so you think like, ah, maybe I should <span style="color:red" data-ts="2276.965" data-end_ts="2277.205" title="2276.965" id=c_"2276.965">__sold__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2277.205" data-end_ts="2277.485" title="2277.205" id=c_"2277.205">__them__</span> together <laugh> and yeah. So I So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You were trying to kickstart them into getting their work done. Right, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rob: </b>Yeah. And the word Benin comes from <laugh>. It was, the device itself is sort of bent by design. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So you don't have to circuit bent it. It's already by design circumvent, and it's a bit in between a, a banjo and a violin <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Well, that's a perfect place to land <laugh>. It's great. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rob: </b>Yeah. And so first I started to, organize, workshops. I did a couple in the United States at, at Harvest works in New York and some upstate New York somewhere and in Europe. And that sort of got it <span style="color:red" data-ts="2322.405" data-end_ts="2322.645" title="2322.405" id=c_"2322.405">__going__</span>. I, I think that some 400 people <span style="color:red" data-ts="2324.535" data-end_ts="2324.885" title="2324.535" id=c_"2324.535">__build__</span> ence workshops and by sort of guaranteeing that at the end of the workshop <span style="color:red" data-ts="2329.685" data-end_ts="2329.885" title="2329.685" id=c_"2329.685">__they__</span> would go home with a working device. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> meaning that at the end of the workshop I had to do a lot of checking, but I fixed 'em all. So people really go, went home with a working device. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And then, but at a certain moment, I didn't have time anymore to do these workshops, but I already put it in the public domain straight away. But then of course there are people that, that cannot build these kits for some reason, or because they don't have the time or they really don't know <laugh>, they have lefthand or something. Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rob: </b>I had a couple of requests from people to, to do it as a, as a module. So I licensed the idea to EPOCH Modular that is making a Benin for Eurorack to a guy named Derek Holzer from Berlin, who is, also known under the name mbi, who basically builds them as standalone boxes with banana connectors. There is, PCBs available through, several <span style="color:red" data-ts="2392.195" data-end_ts="2392.485" title="2392.195" id=c_"2392.195">__fora__</span>, like muffler. It's only that I would like that people basically would try to build it themselves. And there's quite a few, I got a lot of emails from people that actually etched their own PCB and drilled it and made it and, and successfully built it. It's, it <span style="color:red" data-ts="2410.725" data-end_ts="2410.765" title="2410.725" id=c_"2410.725">__is__</span> just to stimulate a bit <span style="color:red" data-ts="2412.085" data-end_ts="2412.285" title="2412.085" id=c_"2412.085">__the__</span> the do it yourself world. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's really interesting. Well, and you know, you talked, you and I are roughly the same age. You talked a little bit about coming up and, you know, it was like the ham radio movement kind of got you into electronics. It seems like these musical devices are kind of an entry path now for the current generation of folks to get into electronics. And so if that's, by doing what you did there, you actually helped them, move that forward. That's really fantastic. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rob: </b>Yeah, it's, it's, I I, I I hope I, have been able to contribute my 2 cents to this, community, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>To this conversation. Yeah. So before I let you go, I, you know, I know if, if you're already a year and a half behind on getting systems built, you're probably not worried a lot about churning a lot of new, new stuff, but you're a designer at heart, so you must have designs that you're playing with. What kind of things are you working on for the future? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rob: </b>I have, notebooks full of, of stuff and IDs and things that I've breadboarded and basically hundreds of them. But actually to come from a, from an ID that works on a breadboard to an actual module, that takes me about 10 months. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rob: </b>Because to get it into production, it's a different thing because the moment when it's production, it needs to be a totally reliable thing. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And so I do a lot of testing and basically one of the nice things is that I do my own things. I, I don't, take a schematic from the internet or something from somebody else and sort of copy it. I, I design, really <span style="color:red" data-ts="2522.105" data-end_ts="2522.525" title="2522.105" id=c_"2522.105">__design__</span> the stuff totally myself. Right. But that means that you also design the sound 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rob: </b>And so I spend a lot of time sort of looking for the right sound and until I found that sound and I built several prototypes and all prototypes give exactly the same sounds. So meaning that when you go put it in production, it's repeatable. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, yeah. That takes time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Well, and it's interesting though to hear that you, this kind of design methodology that you follow, it's, it really is, you really hold yourself to that very, very seriously, don't you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rob: </b>No. I have to make my own life interesting for myself. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I hear that. I hear that. Well, Rob, I wanna thank you so much for spending the time. It was great to get to hear about, you know, your perspectives and how you approach this stuff. I mean, it, it really aligns with my sense of what the musical result is. So that's, that's really fabulous. Thank you so much. And I, I really do appreciate it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rob: </b>Okay, pleasure is <span style="color:red" data-ts="2591.405" data-end_ts="2591.565" title="2591.405" id=c_"2591.405">__all__</span> mine. Thank you very much. Alright, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Bye now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rob: </b>Bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, many thanks to Rob for that chat. Lot of fun. Really interesting stuff. Remember again to please, take a look at our Kickstarter campaign. We're trying to get an update on our mic and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2615.405" data-end_ts="2615.645" title="2615.405" id=c_"2615.405">__Mike__</span> Capri. So if you could do that, you can either check the show notes or you can run over to Kickstarter and just do search on art, music technology. You'll find us, it's pretty straightforward. Beyond that, I want to thank you, the listeners for showing up every week for continuing to give us some great numbers on our end and for just in general supporting me. I appreciate it so much and I'll talk to you again next week.
