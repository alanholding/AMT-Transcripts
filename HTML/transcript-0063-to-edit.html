<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. This week I'm very excited to, introduce my guest. His name is Dave Fulton Probably half of you, the listeners are already jumping up and down. Those of you aren't need to be jumping up and down. He's, a phenomenal artist. He's somebody who has kind of like occupied the same galaxies as I have over the years, even though we've never really spent time with each other. But he's, most widely known as, one of the, people behind the band dweller at the threshold. He's also done solo work. Recently he's been, and not even so recently, but, over the last few years, he's been doing collaborations. He did, he did some work with, one of my favorite guys out there, Charles Rais. And he is also one of the people that is really identified with American analog synth stuff. So now, if that isn't just the serius and weirdest introduction ever, I don't care because I am just really excited to have Dave on on the podcast. Dave, welcome. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave Fulton: </b>Thanks for having me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, I really appreciate you taking time to, to chat with me. I know you're incredibly busy and got your fingers in 20 pies at any given time, so thanks for taking the time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Oh, you're welcome. This is, this is great. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, I kind of gave the, the introduction in a pretty smear way, and some of it is because I think a lot of the people that listen to my podcast are gonna already know who you are. But for those who don't, why don't you give us, just to give them a quick overview of how you think of yourself. How do you self-identify? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Oh, that's interesting, <laugh>. Well, first of all, I'm male. I typically wear pants. But, I don't know, how do, how do I <span style="color:red" data-ts="129.52" data-end_ts="129.74" title="129.52" id=c_"129.52">__sim__</span> self-identify, at least musically? I've, I've, I've always kind of walked the line between the creative side and the engineering side. I, I think in theory, I have more in common, with some of the, how shall I say, well, some of the keyboardist or, or, music that you've heard created by engineers rather than by virtuosos. And I mean, if you want, virtuosos, you know where to go, you can always find your Rick Wakeman. You can always find your, you know, your em embodies and, you know, there's, there's, it just goes right on. So, you know who I'm talking about when I say people that can really play. That's something that's, that hasn't necessarily come easy to me. I have to spend long hours wood shagging. But I think it's because a lot of my attention is diverted away from, Hey, that's a pretty light. <span style="color:red" data-ts="188.47" data-end_ts="188.76" title="188.47" id=c_"188.47">__Yeah__</span>. I think I wanna go find out why it's, it's blinking like that. <laugh>. And so my, my, my intention span moves away from the purely creative side to the, the, engineering or under the hood side of, of, of, of music creation. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. That's, that's a great way to, to put it. But, I would say that maybe I would say what what makes you, an interesting artist is that you are one of those people. I, I think of you as a person who makes great choices, right? When I listen to your, when I listen to your music, I hear great choices being made. And what that a lot of times means is that <span style="color:red" data-ts="231.52" data-end_ts="231.72" title="231.52" id=c_"231.52">__it__</span> means is that you really understand inside your head what you want something to sound like before it necessarily gets squirted out. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Well, that, that would be, that's funny. I, I, I've also, heard myself described that way by other people, or in similar, similar ways. I, I tend to be very, very good with a razor blade <laugh>. And, and I, I get a lot of pleasure out of listening to tons and tons of, let's say, non-complete or incomplete or music with no home, right. And finding ways of knitting it together, either by intention or just after legging the materials set with me. One of the things that, you know, dwelled certainly, had going for it was we had a couple of strong people in that band. Paul Ellis being, I say compositionally, you know, pretty darn good, right? And then, then you had <span style="color:red" data-ts="299.02" data-end_ts="299.24" title="299.02" id=c_"299.02">__me__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="299.24" data-end_ts="299.44" title="299.24" id=c_"299.24">__that__</span> would sit there and, wade through the chaff, let's say, and, you know, kind of take all of it and condense it down into what was really meaningful. As well as, <span style="color:red" data-ts="311.38" data-end_ts="311.6" title="311.38" id=c_"311.38">__as__</span>, you know, I had, you know, I had my own my own contributions either by, by the, the actual editorial decisions and, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="320.35" data-end_ts="320.84" title="320.35" id=c_"320.35">__editing__</span> and, and and such, and, or by, you know, traditional, Hey, this is my song, you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Know? Right, right. Part of my podcast is I like to talk to people about the whatever elements that they went through in order to get to be the artist that they are. And in your case, because you have sort of like this affinity to, the engineer's life, but also are doing very creative work, both. And while I appreciate you talking about your collaborators, I, I also though your solo work is phenomenal, and, and so there's, there's clearly a creative side to what you do and how you think as well. And I'm just curious, what was your background that, that made you into the artists that you are? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Well, my, my father as well as being a number of different things. <laugh> was a policeman, for instance. <span style="color:red" data-ts="384.25" data-end_ts="384.47" title="384.25" id=c_"384.25">__Not__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="384.47" data-end_ts="384.63" title="384.47" id=c_"384.47">__the__</span> nicest guy in the world at times, was a keyboardist <span style="color:red" data-ts="387.67" data-end_ts="387.87" title="387.67" id=c_"387.67">__and__</span> a bass player. And so, there was a lot of, Hey, if you're gonna play with my instruments, you're gonna learn how to play them, right, <laugh>, and, you know, sit down, play, bam over, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="401.99" data-end_ts="402.23" title="401.99" id=c_"401.99">__wrap__</span> over the, knuckles, do it again. You know? And I lost, I lost, interest in keyboards fairly quickly, and synthesizers, he can have a whole lot of those, but, 'cause this is like, I'm gonna say 77 or 78. Okay. And, you know, he was your traditional Hammond B three guy, you know, various, you know, American, you know, like, and, and Italian, keyboards of various vintages, but no, no real synthesizers. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>So I would start taking his devices while he was at work and plug them in as he put it incorrectly, right? And just so I could just get these beautiful, intense, noisy, rocky guitary kind of things coming out of these polite sounding fox continentals and stuff like that. So, I, it, it started there, and then I, because of that rejection, I bought a guitar. So I bought a guitar to punish my dad <laugh>. And, I realized very quickly that was not my instrument, and went back back to keyboards, but was out of his, out of his vision at that point. And, and at the same time, believe it or not, home computers started to happen. Apple Twos, and such where, hey, I can put in <span style="color:red" data-ts="496.35" data-end_ts="496.47" title="496.35" id=c_"496.35">__a__</span> parallel interface card, even before MIDI <span style="color:red" data-ts="500.07" data-end_ts="500.27" title="500.07" id=c_"500.07">__could__</span> buy a MIDI card, you could, you know, take the pia, you know, modular, but you just built, and, you know, control it, make it do things, you know, by writing a piece of software that would, you know, script something out. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>And usually it was, you know, pretty academic stuff. But it, it, it, it certainly, provided the fodder that, you know, for my, my electronic music, and widening of my, my ears to, you know, kind of get into some of the more bizarre aspects of, of electronic music. And it wasn't until I actually met John Deval many, many, many years later who, he has a true mastery of the abstract. And, that, I realized I, I found somebody else that, that kind of always, he did what I wanted to do way back then mm-hmm. <affirmative>, and he could do it really well. But I ended up from that point, you know, started playing music by myself and, you know, making tapes and, doing other things like that, like everybody else was doing in Oh, the mid to, you know, late eighties and such. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>And even the early eighties, and then something rang true, that my father said, he goes, someday, Dave, you're going to want to learn the vocabulary of music so you can play with other people. Right. And that, that was interesting when I moved to Portland, I, it's not that I hadn't played with anybody else prior to moving to Portland <span style="color:red" data-ts="603.38" data-end_ts="603.6" title="603.38" id=c_"603.38">__in__</span> 89. It, it, <span style="color:red" data-ts="606.54" data-end_ts="606.76" title="606.54" id=c_"606.54">__the__</span> world opened up. There was all these people in Portland wanting to play strange electronic music, and you were all in the same wavelength. And, through Dumpster, which was a loose collective of musicians. That performed quite regularly for a while in the early, late eighties and early nineties. You know, came, came out of the, the dweller of the threshold came out of that, group of people. And, and then of course, you know, meeting Mike Griffin and, and, and just getting into the ambient world on that side helped, you know, helped a lot. So that's kind of, you know, led me to the point where I am at now, where I play also in a, a Fourplay four piece <span style="color:red" data-ts="658.12" data-end_ts="658.44" title="658.12" id=c_"658.12">__crowd__</span>, rock band, <laugh>. So, you know, now I can actually play, which is interesting. 'cause now I can go on a stage and, and for the first time ever feel like I can just jam with people. That vocabulary, was effectively learned, at least in a rock context. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I didn't know you were playing in a <span style="color:red" data-ts="677.12" data-end_ts="677.32" title="677.12" id=c_"677.12">__CR__</span> Rock band. I'm gonna, given my background, I'm gonna have to come and sit in with you guys next time I'm in Portland. So when you talk about like, being in the, in the eighties and kind of doing what other people were doing, were you involved in the cassette tape exchange world? Very much. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>You know, only at the very, very end of it. And that was when I moved to Portland, because Dumpster was producing cassettes. You know, like every single week we'd get together and produce two more, you know, two either horribly inspired or horribly bad <laugh> <span style="color:red" data-ts="715.02" data-end_ts="715.24" title="715.02" id=c_"715.02">__of__</span>, you know, gems <laugh> and the folks that were in charge of that kind of archiving wood trade tapes with people. Sure. And I actually found a couple of those cassettes, that we got, were actually out on the trading circuit, for, for a while. And I, I, I haven't had the, I, I, I, I haven't had the time yet, but I will, I just want to hear how they sound. What is it almost, you know, 28 years later, 27 years later, you know, just to see, you know, what are they, you know, what they sound like, what the heck are we thinking? I mean, at that particular time, the various members of Dumpster were listening to everything from Skinny Puppy to, you know, front 2 42 to <span style="color:red" data-ts="768.34" data-end_ts="768.56" title="768.34" id=c_"768.34">__the__</span> Schultz, you know, Tangerine Dream. So there's all these influences, and we all had the worst possible beat up samplers we could get. Right. So, as long as, you know, and, you know, whatever analog synth was cast off at that particular point, I think people that are younger that might be listening to us, don't remember a period of time when people were throwing away their, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="795.66" data-end_ts="795.88" title="795.66" id=c_"795.66">__Ah__</span>, throwing away the analogs, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>The analog, you know, polyphonic and, and, monophonic <span style="color:red" data-ts="801.56" data-end_ts="801.88" title="801.56" id=c_"801.56">__since__</span>, and you could get them for, for virtually nothing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. The number of times I saw, like, one of my favorite old poly synths was the, sadly, you know, what I consider still underrated, Corg Poly six, I remember times when you could go to music store and they would have four of 'em stacked up. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> trying to sell 'em for 50 bucks a piece because someone just, you know, people come in and trade 'em for DX Sevens and never wanted to see those things again. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Wow. The $50 Poly six, they've, they've certainly come back around. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>They have, they have, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>You know, I, I have a poly six that's in pieces right now. I've torn it apart to <span style="color:red" data-ts="845.8" data-end_ts="846.04" title="845.8" id=c_"845.8">__raise__</span> the, the filter chips and put it into some modules for my modular synthesizer. But, I've also snagged the, ensemble board. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Yeah. That's a beautiful sounding thing, isn't it? Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Yes, it is. And I, I plan before I die to actually rack mount it and put some IO on it so I can use it with my modular. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, we're gonna talk about your modular in a second, but before we get there, Portland Dumpster Strange Music, how does this not sound? I mean, you said that you moved there in 89. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Yeah, I was 89. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And so it already had a world of strange music people. And I'll tell you, I was there a couple of months ago for a performance and a little workshop, and I think all those same people just came up and just would randomly start talking. To me, it seems like there's something about Portland that is not only accepting, but sort of like a generative influence of the weird, what's up with that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Well, I'm certainly glad they accept me <laugh>, because yeah, you're, you're kind of, you're, you're right about that. But I would, I would go so far to <span style="color:red" data-ts="924.32" data-end_ts="924.52" title="924.32" id=c_"924.32">__say__</span> that just about any major metropolitan area has it, has that kind of going on in it a little bit. I mean, Philadelphia <span style="color:red" data-ts="933.96" data-end_ts="934.28" title="933.96" id=c_"933.96">__would__</span> be a, a great one, decide as an example. Seattle's another, but, I think Portland has a little, it seems a little more d i y here. And I, I think that you were here for, speaking of d i y you were here for, Romeo's performance. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, dude. I, <span style="color:red" data-ts="953.06" data-end_ts="953.28" title="953.06" id=c_"953.06">__and__</span>, and it's something, because I had followed him on analog heaven for years and years and years. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, I had never seen him perform, and I had never seen his system. And oh my God, what a revelation. It was wonderful. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>It's a beautiful looking instrument. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's amazing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Yeah. And, you know, as a matter of fact, there was myself and, another guy there named Brian McGill who were, and actually I think there was a third guy there, Jay Schwarzenberg. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. They were all, we were all, we were all Dumpster alumni. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see. And 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>We we're, we're all very much older than we were back then. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Yeah. Well, there you go. <laugh> Murmur. Murmur, yeah. Yeah. But that's, I, I have just been fascinated by Portland, and I would like, you know, I, I need to maybe do a little more research into what makes that place so special, because Portlandia jokes not withstanding, it does seem to generate sort of an attitude that's I, I've not seen anywhere else. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>The other thing that I, I I wanna point out that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1019.48" data-end_ts="1019.68" title="1019.48" id=c_"1019.48">__be__</span> made clear about the music scene here that I've not seen anywhere else, and this is something that I've, I've, I've definitely, taken to heart. There is an acceptance of, of, I'm gonna say you can be 60 and be in a band with 17 year old, and there's a respect and, a a for both, you know, on both <span style="color:red" data-ts="1052.3" data-end_ts="1052.52" title="1052.3" id=c_"1052.3">__go__</span> both directions for age and styles of music. And, hey, let's take this and put it in a blender, and it doesn't matter where you're coming from, it could be r and b. I happen to know a couple of guys that came out of the prod world that were on labels, like Formm and stuff like that. They're now doing straight ahead r and b with, like people that are decades older than them and decades younger. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Wow. And it just, there, there seems to be an acceptance of just everything. So age, style, they all gets mixed up, you know, sex, you know, sexuality, you know, it's all just kind of, Hey, that seems like it might be interesting. Let's bring you in. You know, it, it, it, it's an amazing time. I don't, I hope it never gets, like <span style="color:red" data-ts="1103.58" data-end_ts="1103.8" title="1103.58" id=c_"1103.58">__the__</span> nineties version of Seattle where we end up with like, you know, the mega, mega trend. I don't, I don't think we ever will. I think Portlandia effectively killed Portland's longevity for cool, which is fine, <laugh>, I want everybody to go away. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>So, I guess, you know, it, it, it's strange when I see the clubs that I used to frequent close up, and it, you know, Hey, I played, you know, eight shows there, and now it's gone. And, I think we're, we're seeing the ugly side of gentrification, and it's affecting a music scene a bit. But I think the heart, the acceptance, like I was talking about, the mixture of styles, just, the big ears that people have here, is still, still quite wonderful. I mean, we, we, we still suffer from the same things that every other city suffers from, and that's just, you know, bad music. Right. But I think we have <span style="color:red" data-ts="1166.76" data-end_ts="1166.88" title="1166.76" id=c_"1166.76">__a__</span>, a a vast majority, a very accepting, audience and people with just big ears, both musicians and, you know, Johnny punter alike, you know? Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's funny because it seemed like in almost any circumstance I was in, first of all, people are very talkative there. I found myself getting into conversations, you know, I come from Wisconsin where everybody puts their head down and gets to where they're going. Right. But, I found everybody was very talkative. And one of the things that, that I found was that the concept of being a music maker is completely normalized there. Meaning that virtually every taxi driver or hotel doorman or waiter at a restaurant or whatever, you know, they'd be like, oh, why? <span style="color:red" data-ts="1216.7" data-end_ts="1216.92" title="1216.7" id=c_"1216.7">__How__</span>, why are you in town? And I'd tell 'em, and they'd be like, oh, well, I'm in a band and I do this, and my, my spouse is in a, in another mm-hmm. <affirmative> is in another three bands, and they're doing this, and I used to work at CD <span style="color:red" data-ts="1229.36" data-end_ts="1229.64" title="1229.36" id=c_"1229.36">__Baby__</span>, but then those fuckers, dot, dot dot, you know, it was just like, there's this whole, like, everybody identifies themselves as, as having a very musical life. And I think that, that whether they do great music or not is almost irrelevant that what that does is as a sort of like localized society. It makes the acceptance of music be something that's pretty unique. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>They, they are sort <span style="color:red" data-ts="1255.48" data-end_ts="1255.56" title="1255.48" id=c_"1255.48">__of__</span> very important. Hence our Portland Darks tax, that we're, we're <laugh> assessed and have to, to pay. They, they, they just bill us like, it's like our water bill <span style="color:red" data-ts="1266.74" data-end_ts="1266.96" title="1266.74" id=c_"1266.74">__to__</span> get another bill for, for Arts, for Arts <laugh>. Yeah. And mostly it's to support the music <span style="color:red" data-ts="1272.14" data-end_ts="1272.36" title="1272.14" id=c_"1272.14">__and__</span> the schools, which is still woefully underfunded. You know, the, interesting thing is too, the other thing that I'm doing not to, not to speed up on your interviewer, anything, is, I, I put on a radio station here, done the engineering for it. X-Ray FM is kind of a, a microcosm of the ex of the, Portland music scene, both DJ and, musician alike. It's done quite well, and we're continuing to do well. The idea is to kind of do what, A W F M U or K E X <span style="color:red" data-ts="1310.52" data-end_ts="1310.64" title="1310.52" id=c_"1310.52">__P__</span> has done in Seattle, F M U, of course, New York. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>But, it, it, it's, it, it, it kind of reflects that general acceptance of music, that everybody has here. And it's true, everybody's in a band here. So, it is quite possible. Like, the band I'm in now, I'm playing with a, with a guy who's just now, I think he's just hit 30, 31 mm-hmm. <affirmative>, but I, I've known his father. I played with his father in a band. And he, at some point we decided to do his <span style="color:red" data-ts="1349.56" data-end_ts="1349.76" title="1349.56" id=c_"1349.56">__crowd__</span> rock project, and it just doesn't end <laugh>. But you know, it, I, again, I've been playing with that kid since he, I've known him since he was 12, probably played with him a few years later than that, like when using his early teens. But it's that mashup, it, it, it's a story that's told over and over and over again here. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's, that's really cool. And, that's, I think that, I think that maybe while Portlandia might, might have squeezed some of the cool factor out of Portland, maybe that's just gonna keep the, the, the hipster web developers away. But it seems like that kind of attitude towards,

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Hey, you're talking about my drummer now. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sorry, sorry, sorry. Drummer. <laugh>. <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Web developer and drummer. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. There you go. But, you know, I think that that's the kind of thing that, that doesn't go away. And it's interesting you talk about, about the radio station because that's something that, that concept of like a local, a local radio station that really has a personality that kind of went away for a while, with a few exceptions, those you named being the particulars. Although, my friend Gregory Taylor up in Madison, does a thing at, W R T F M, and that's very similar. That's a community supporter radio station that has just never, has never lost its complete grassroots kind of thing. And, you know, in their case, what it means is that, you know, he does a show about weird experimentalism, but it's preceded by a show of gospel music, you know? Yep. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1457.04" data-end_ts="1457.2" title="1457.04" id=c_"1457.04">__And__</span> you get these like, really crazy cross currents and stuff, but it's cool, and it's, it's personality rich, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1466.62" data-end_ts="1466.84" title="1466.62" id=c_"1466.62">__Yep__</span>. And that's, you know, I, I have a show on that, that I do on prod rock, but I, you know, the other thing that we're trying to do, and that, that is to keep things vibrant and not get into a situation like other noncoms, and, that would be where a democracy, you die by death, by democracy. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1487.86" data-end_ts="1488.08" title="1487.86" id=c_"1487.86">__Oh__</span>, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>And you end up with, with shows that have been grandfathered in just simply because, you know, you were there <span style="color:red" data-ts="1496.46" data-end_ts="1496.68" title="1496.46" id=c_"1496.46">__the__</span> longest, even though your show may or may not be relevant or relevant enough to stay on <span style="color:red" data-ts="1501.98" data-end_ts="1502.2" title="1501.98" id=c_"1501.98">__the__</span> air, we're trying to figure out the appropriate, Hey, how do we stay relevant?

So you constantly get a window of what is happening in Portland as far as the music scene happening without being stuck in the Grateful Dead <span style="color:red" data-ts="1520.88" data-end_ts="1521.16" title="1520.88" id=c_"1520.88">__past__</span>. I'm sorry to digress like this. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>No, no, it's interesting. I mean, what's, it's a podcast. It's not like an encyclopedia entry. So we get to talk about whatever we want, and I just happen to find that. Interesting. You said that one of the things your dad told you that, that you came to, understand and respect was this idea of learning the vocabulary of music so that you can play with others. What does that mean to you, and what was the process that you went through to get that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Well, <laugh> it, it was a long, arduous, tear <span style="color:red" data-ts="1562.24" data-end_ts="1562.6" title="1562.24" id=c_"1562.24">__filled__</span> journey, because I, I take this stuff, you know, seriously, and I, I can't necessarily say I, I, I bawled like a baby, but there were nights I was really, just, you know, just not happy with my, with my performance, when I first started to try playing with other people. And, I'm, I'm sure everybody still, I mean, I still go through that, you know, kicking my head, kicking myself, you know, hitting my head, you know, Hey, that was not a great show. Or anyway, what really, really happened, the true moment of, of, of Destiny for me happened when my friend John <span style="color:red" data-ts="1609.53" data-end_ts="1609.88" title="1609.53" id=c_"1609.53">__Deval__</span> invited me to play with a bunch of his old friends who happened to be in the neighborhood mm-hmm. <affirmative>. So, I mean, within a mile <span style="color:red" data-ts="1617.92" data-end_ts="1618.12" title="1617.92" id=c_"1617.92">__of__</span> my house, so, on a night, a week, we would get together and I would play with the old pros, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>And I was not an old pro. And, they were playing pretty much blues and jazz <span style="color:red" data-ts="1635.64" data-end_ts="1635.96" title="1635.64" id=c_"1635.64">__based__</span> rock. And, I got there and they put me in front of a Hammond B three <laugh>, and, which, you know, was familiar to me on, on, on, on a, on a number of levels. And I had, you know, it's not like I didn't know how to operate the device. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1652.52" data-end_ts="1652.64" title="1652.52" id=c_"1652.52">__I__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1652.64" data-end_ts="1652.8" title="1652.64" id=c_"1652.64">__know__</span> how to play it, but, but to play it in the context <span style="color:red" data-ts="1657.3" data-end_ts="1657.52" title="1657.3" id=c_"1657.3">__of__</span> what they were used to, I also brought a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1660.52" data-end_ts="1660.76" title="1660.52" id=c_"1660.52">__sink__</span> inside it down, but, for a bit of, of, of warmth and familiarity. But the reality is, is I got my ass kicked and handed to me night after night, week after week after week. After the first time I played with 'em, they stepped outside for a moment, and John, I think, was out there with them, and I was straightening out some stuff I wanted to, I felt my performance was somewhat less than stellar, and I knew it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>So I figured, Hey, what's the thing I know best? Well, let's figure everything organized electronically better, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1696.07" data-end_ts="1696.36" title="1696.07" id=c_"1696.07">__just__</span> make sure my cabling is right, make, you know, get everything adjusted my level's right. And then I stepped outside, and as I was making my round on my way around the door, I overheard their conversation and, it was not flattering. Right. And, what the, what I finally heard was, we'll get him, we'll get him into shape. Oh, wow. So these old guys took an interest, obviously John did too. And, that's when it came down to, oh, I guess you've gotta know your scales. You've got to, you know, gotta figure out where people are, are, you gotta understand more about the music theory. If you don't, if you're not a natural, then the only thing you can do is practice. And, you know, musically, I had it all up in my head to get it out to your fingers, was the difficult part. So at that point there, I started taking mandolin lessons and, started playing piano. Right. Strictly piano and just, you know, doing 45 minutes of scales a day. And then when I was thrown into situations where I was jamming with, with, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1779.2" data-end_ts="1779.4" title="1779.2" id=c_"1779.2">__you__</span> know, mostly blues based rock bands, it's like, oh my God, I'm there. Right. I can do this. And, you can, you know, you can go up, you all start <span style="color:red" data-ts="1790.59" data-end_ts="1790.88" title="1790.59" id=c_"1790.59">__look__</span> at vocabulary. This is what my dad was talking about. So, so how 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Long do you feel, how long did it take from the time you decided I need to get serious, until you felt like, all right, I can exist in this world. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Well, that's funny. 'cause we'd released two dweller albums, and I had just finished my solo record and still did not feel I was a player. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. So it wasn't, well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Because playing in playing in that kind of environment is a completely different discipline than being a good record producer. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Yeah. It also involved, you know, admitting to yourself that, you know, that Abba record wasn't all that bad. Right, right. You know, you had to, you had to throw, I, I, I ended up throwing away a lot of my preconceived, or, you know, norms or, or thoughts about certain types of music. And going back to the music that my, my dad liked, and the music that I heard on the radio as I grew up and going, this is why I liked it. And, this is why people learn, learn to play together. And one of the things that I don't see a lot in, electronic music are groups. And, and there are some, don't get me wrong, groups of folks that play together. There's lots of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1879.28" data-end_ts="1879.44" title="1879.28" id=c_"1879.28">__us__</span> solo artists out there. But to do electronic music and to instinctively feed off of one another, knowing that you have a huge palette of, you know, power <span style="color:red" data-ts="1892.02" data-end_ts="1892.24" title="1892.02" id=c_"1892.02">__to__</span> sound available to every one of you that allows you to pull, you know, a full 10 fingered cord out of your, every one of you can do this Right. While holding on a sustained <span style="color:red" data-ts="1903.28" data-end_ts="1903.44" title="1903.28" id=c_"1903.28">__title__</span> and making this, this huge noise. But sometimes that's appropriate and sometimes it's not. But when do you get to that point in electronic music where it's fun to listen to, fun to make, and, you are really in sync with the other guys around you, and you're, you're all just on the same wavelength. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1930.74" data-end_ts="1930.96" title="1930.74" id=c_"1930.74">__It__</span> is. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. And there's, there's almost, yeah, there's almost an E s <span style="color:red" data-ts="1934.48" data-end_ts="1934.6" title="1934.48" id=c_"1934.48">__P__</span> that between the players, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>And, and learning that's, that was, this is that vocabulary. This is that thought processes that my father was so intent on making sure that I, I learned. And, ultimately I did, but he was dead. You know, if I have anything to say to him at this point, you were right. Dammit, <laugh>, and I would encourage, you know, other people out there to, you know, to, to, to get together and start playing, take those electronics and use 'em with, with other types of instruments acoustic. Take, take the wraps off of your analog sense and get out there and play with bands. You'll, you'll learn to love the music. Your solo music will get better. Right. Everything will, will come, once you reach that point. Now, that's not to say the people in their basements, or home studios or whatever, that work by themselves. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>And I can name a whole bunch of people. I have no disrespect for that. In fact, it's wonderful that there are people out there that, make music by themselves, and the results are completely theirs, and they're good. It's good music. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. I, I think though, in every, just about every one of those cases where I can say they've done it, you know, they're, they're great a solo artist, and they can work great alone. I'll bet you that they, at some point, were in a band with somebody else for a long period of time, or <span style="color:red" data-ts="2035.68" data-end_ts="2035.88" title="2035.68" id=c_"2035.68">__with__</span>, because it's very rare that you, you, you, you have to learn that, that thing, that vocabulary about music, that, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2045.16" data-end_ts="2045.4" title="2045.16" id=c_"2045.16">__that__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2045.51" data-end_ts="2045.8" title="2045.51" id=c_"2045.51">__that__</span> help you get those thoughts out of your head and on to a keyboard or, onto, you know, onto your, into your sequencer even. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>If we talk about dweller. Yeah. Did, how did you guys operate as a a, a band? Did you generally record together and do that kind of thing? Did you sit, I mean, there are pictures of you, like sitting around in the same room and playing, but was that kind of the typical way that you did music making? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Well, to answer your question, how did we do all that poorly is my first reaction. <laugh>. But, a, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2089.44" data-end_ts="2089.56" title="2089.44" id=c_"2089.44">__a__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2089.6" data-end_ts="2089.72" title="2089.6" id=c_"2089.6">__a__</span> as a band, we had horrible relationship. I'm not going to deny that. It was, it was terrible up until the time that John John joined, the band, there were moments of, you know, I'm gonna say they were, they were good. But yeah, it just all in all, not one of my favorite experiences in my life, but it did teach you about being in a dysfunctional band. Right. But, how we did things back then were, we would typically each have, the first album <span style="color:red" data-ts="2122.3" data-end_ts="2122.52" title="2122.3" id=c_"2122.3">__was__</span> made up of individual songs. Okay. I had material, Paul had material. I don't think Jeff really had anything at that particular time. There was something that him and, him and, Paul had worked on together. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>But, what typically happened was somebody had an idea or some basic tracks, and the rest of the time was spent enhancing them, doing overdubs, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2151.96" data-end_ts="2152.12" title="2151.96" id=c_"2151.96">__whatever__</span> we needed to do <span style="color:red" data-ts="2152.8" data-end_ts="2152.96" title="2152.8" id=c_"2152.8">__that__</span> to, to make them work. The first album was done with a combination of eight track and, vision and sq one sequencer. Paul had a Esq one with a, with a sequencer that was built in that he was actually extremely adept, at using the, the big song on there, no boundary condition that was recorded Live, all of us three, all three of us, listening to a set of backing tracks and, playing to Eight Track, and then doing live remixes with synced matrix to, to <span style="color:red" data-ts="2191.82" data-end_ts="2192.04" title="2191.82" id=c_"2191.82">__dat__</span>. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, very primitive, but very much a studio, a studio, cat flow studio exercise. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The second album was, digital audio editing had come into Vogue. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>It was cheaply enough for me to afford, chief enough for me to afford. And, we started <span style="color:red" data-ts="2210.51" data-end_ts="2211" title="2210.51" id=c_"2210.51">__heading__</span> down that road where either Paul or I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2214.29" data-end_ts="2214.64" title="2214.29" id=c_"2214.29">__would__</span> get together and, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2216.54" data-end_ts="2216.76" title="2216.54" id=c_"2216.54">__Jam__</span>, Jeff A. Little bit. And, then, we would edit those performances down. And in the case of the second album, we took it one step further. I used, a friend of mine used <laugh>. I hope he doesn't feel that way, <laugh>. We, we, we certainly didn't pay him very much. He cer. But, we, a I asked him because there was so much, infighting within, within the ranks that, I decided to bring in a third party and have them do the final editorial decisions. And he happened to have an ear that, that I respected quite a lot. And thus the second album was done, and it, it did well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>All of this stuff. I mean, I don't think Dweller put out a dog album. They definitely changed from <span style="color:red" data-ts="2274.08" data-end_ts="2274.36" title="2274.08" id=c_"2274.08">__style__</span>, you know, to, from album to album to album Sure. By the time the third album came around. And that's when we, Jeff decided that he was no longer, and, and I'm still really good friends with Jeff, by the way, so he just decided he didn't, it wasn't for him. And so he decided to leave. And Paul had left, for a while, invited John in mm-hmm. <affirmative>, and John and I started to do another album, and then Paul decided to come back. And it got to the point where, with John, and where I was happening at Musically that we started to create as a three piece, there was very little, nobody came with an idea. Nobody came with a song. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>We ended up jamming, and then my chops as far as knowing how to, how to cross <span style="color:red" data-ts="2325.91" data-end_ts="2326.2" title="2325.91" id=c_"2325.91">__fade__</span> and, and bring sections in and, and, and compose using the digital audio editor kind of came into being, and it worked really well. And, that album, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2338.95" data-end_ts="2339.24" title="2338.95" id=c_"2338.95">__aura__</span> Boris was released and, was on Mike's label. Mm-hmm. Not Mike <span style="color:red" data-ts="2343.64" data-end_ts="2344.04" title="2343.64" id=c_"2343.64">__Matley__</span>, Mike Griffin. Right. And, that's the, you, that's the Hypnos label, right? That's the Hypnos label. Yeah. And, that pretty much spelt the end of the band, although John and I, you know, did a show or two, I think we played stars <span style="color:red" data-ts="2360.74" data-end_ts="2360.96" title="2360.74" id=c_"2360.74">__and__</span>, and, we had, another event, in, Europe and, which unfortunately, John did not make it to, I'll let, someday I'll let him tell that story. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, it's all very amusing as we think about it. Now. At the time, I was petrified, my musical collaborator and friend did not show up at the pre appointed time in The Hague. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2388.98" data-end_ts="2389.2" title="2388.98" id=c_"2388.98">__Oh__</span>, sounds like a story. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Yeah. But like I said, I'll let John explain it from his perspective. Yeah. Okay. But I had brought in, I called him Two Ringers, Mr. Paul <span style="color:red" data-ts="2401.14" data-end_ts="2401.36" title="2401.14" id=c_"2401.14">__Uck__</span> and Giles Reeves. And, I kind of, you know, Giles and I talked about it, and we knew Paul would do just fine with anything we threw at him, but we were in a situation where we couldn't perform the album, you know, the way it was intended, you know? Right. So, what I had to do was teach Giles the best I could. All of John's parts. Oh, my. And the, I, you know, the ideas behind them. And then, what I did was I concentrated on my parts, and then I also asked Giles to be a musical director of, of the whole thing, just kind of, Hey, if we're gonna have to make new pieces of music that we didn't know we were gonna have to do, how are we going to do this? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>I have enough stuff getting a logistics of this gig down and Right. You know, where we're staying and managing the event. And, and such, I asked him to take that on. And that was probably one of the nicest things he's ever done for, for me or for us, except mixing the last Mo <span style="color:red" data-ts="2469.32" data-end_ts="2469.48" title="2469.32" id=c_"2469.32">__Trick__</span> album. He did that too, but, but, I don't wanna forget. He's just a great guy in general, but he, we pulled that off. It, it went, it went well because of, of, of him. And, eventually him and I ended up doing an album together, because of, of, of how well we worked together. And we hope that we'll do another one. Neither of us is particularly fast. We all have other things that, you know, kind of take us away from our, from what our Love is. Sure. Which is music, you know, to like, do things like Eat and Make Money. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>When, when did that first album come out? That was like the late two thousands, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>The, the, the, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The one you did with Giles. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Oh, that was 2007. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Yeah, that was, 2007. And, I, I just put out my latest record on Hypno, so I don't know if you have a copy of that yet. Darwin I've been really bad, at promoting it, <laugh> mainly because, I expect, the record label to do that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, let's promote it right now. What's the name? What's the name of it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>I forget. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, me Too. <laugh> Awesome. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>White. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2544.59" data-end_ts="2544.88" title="2544.59" id=c_"2544.59">__Like__</span> that

</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>It's called, hold on, I'm actually grabbing a copy right now. Right. It's called, of Those Things Left Unsaid. And really, this is eight tracks that have been, it has taken since my last solo album in 1999 to <span style="color:red" data-ts="2567.46" data-end_ts="2567.88" title="2567.46" id=c_"2567.46">__compli__</span> another solo album's worth of material. And again, it's because I'm horribly, I suffer from, I guess must be O C D or something where I just, I edit and I edit and I edit, and I don't know when to quit. And it just takes me a while to, to get through it. And I, I told myself I was gonna have this thing out two years ago, and it was <span style="color:red" data-ts="2591.28" data-end_ts="2591.48" title="2591.28" id=c_"2591.28">__on__</span>, it only came out about two and a half, three months ago. So I, I'm kind of behind schedule. I'll go, I'm actively creating other new music. But this album probably, it's, it's different, because of the, the, the amount of time it took to create, it's a little bit more concise and, or feels like a, a complete concept, especially, I'm gonna call it the second song cycle <span style="color:red" data-ts="2620.12" data-end_ts="2620.36" title="2620.12" id=c_"2620.12">__that__</span> was originally supposed to come out on vinyl. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>And, still will, I need to go talk to the guy that runs Jealous Butcher today. When I get done with this, I gotta run by his house and pick something up. He doesn't live very far away, you know, say, Hey, I'm, I'm ready to, to do this vinyl thing <span style="color:red" data-ts="2640.64" data-end_ts="2640.8" title="2640.64" id=c_"2640.64">__to__</span> probably be a somewhat limited edition version of the same package with maybe an extra song thrown in for good measure, on a, on a, on another side. 'cause I'm not sure how I'm <span style="color:red" data-ts="2652.32" data-end_ts="2652.4" title="2652.32" id=c_"2652.32">__gonna__</span> divide it up. The song is, it's basically set to, to fit on two sides of an lp. But even then, at 46, you know, minutes, 47 minutes is a bit too long for, for an lp. Right. You start really having to, you start losing some of your dynamics, and I Sure, I wish to preserve that. So it might be something that's spread out over four sides of a two Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>A double, double double <span style="color:red" data-ts="2680.16" data-end_ts="2680.36" title="2680.16" id=c_"2680.16">__dip__</span> scale. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Yeah. So I'm, I'm, I'm <span style="color:red" data-ts="2682.28" data-end_ts="2682.4" title="2682.28" id=c_"2682.28">__not__</span> gonna be actually working on that and getting the artwork moved over, but, but for now, this is what is available this <span style="color:red" data-ts="2688.66" data-end_ts="2688.88" title="2688.66" id=c_"2688.66">__CD__</span> of his Primitive 44 1 Stereo Coaster <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>That I'm certainly glad it's still that people still like, yeah. You know, it's got music before, the demise <span style="color:red" data-ts="2703.36" data-end_ts="2703.56" title="2703.36" id=c_"2703.36">__of__</span> Dweller. It's actually got a song that, was going to either go, I think it was gonna go on my last solo album, and I didn't make it, because I felt it sounded too much like another one. I, I listen now and I go, what the heck was I thinking? Right. And, another one that was probably gonna go on one <span style="color:red" data-ts="2726.52" data-end_ts="2726.56" title="2726.52" id=c_"2726.52">__of__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2726.56" data-end_ts="2726.68" title="2726.56" id=c_"2726.56">__the__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2726.68" data-end_ts="2726.8" title="2726.68" id=c_"2726.68">__two__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2726.8" data-end_ts="2727.04" title="2726.8" id=c_"2726.8">__other__</span> albums, and there's, there's a bunch more material <span style="color:red" data-ts="2729.64" data-end_ts="2729.88" title="2729.64" id=c_"2729.64">__that__</span> I, that when Paul left and, before John joined, I was just making music. It was really kind of, inspiring to go, okay, this ship is now, you know, mine, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Kind of a cathartic thing. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>And I will, I will make it work. And, you know, it, it didn't work the way I expected, but it worked. And nonetheless, and, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2756.04" data-end_ts="2756.28" title="2756.04" id=c_"2756.04">__some__</span> of that leftover material mega onto this album, and then I'm gonna say the, the, the second side is stuff that I've been working on since 2004 till now. Okay. So it, it just takes, there's so much material that wasn't used that I could probably do another one of these. Right. And, probably nobody will ever hear it, which is a good thing. But it's something that I will keep around and use for ideas, photographer for new compositions as I move forward. Because guess what, I'm 53 and I'm looking forward to the time when I can go back into my, my basement, my home studio and just record by myself again. It's come full circle. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. It, it has, speaking of coming full circle, one of the things I would say you are known for is having always been kind of a, well, and, and I don't know, maybe this isn't exactly true, but the, the perception of you is that you've always been a staunch analog advocate. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Right. Well, that's funny. I used to go to this bar called The Basement Pub, and there was a, another Dave that would go there, and he was known as Analog Dave, and I was known as Digital Dave <laugh>. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So there you go. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Yeah. I would say, that is, that perception of me being an analog guy is not entirely correct, as was the impression that as a, I was not a digital guy either. I used to take kind of offense, especially when Dave was there. 'cause we got these great debates, because he was in, in, in typical Portland hipster, you know, fashion, you know, he wanted to do everything analog, right. Everything right. Soup <span style="color:red" data-ts="2869.84" data-end_ts="2869.96" title="2869.84" id=c_"2869.84">__to__</span> nuts, analog console, analog mic, well, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2872.28" data-end_ts="2872.48" title="2872.28" id=c_"2872.28">__yeah__</span>, analog 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Tape, analog <span style="color:red" data-ts="2873.84" data-end_ts="2874" title="2873.84" id=c_"2873.84">__nick__</span> analog, the whole <span style="color:red" data-ts="2875.24" data-end_ts="2875.36" title="2875.24" id=c_"2875.24">__bit__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Analog everything. Yeah. And, you know, and the product will be on vinyl. And this was years ago, this is before vinyl took off again. But people in Portland were starting to collect it. Like it, it was coming back. He was the proto hipster <laugh>. What he didn't understand what people like, what people, what people didn't, when they heard this, well, you're digital Dave. I go, I've got one of the largest modular systems in Portland. What are you talking about? <span style="color:red" data-ts="2900.62" data-end_ts="2900.84" title="2900.62" id=c_"2900.62">__And__</span> it's all analog, you know, and I build this analog stuff. Right. You know, so I never quite got that, but yeah. To answer your, to, to answer your question or to make, you know, to, speak to your point, yeah, I have lots of analog gear. I do have no love for the classics. And, and, and this is why, and I, believe me, I'm not saying that a poly moog's a bad idea. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>I would love to have one. I just got tired of working on them at some point. Right. I had to make a decision. Either I'm gonna play these instruments or I'm going to work on <span style="color:red" data-ts="2941.64" data-end_ts="2941.72" title="2941.64" id=c_"2941.64">__them__</span>, work on <span style="color:red" data-ts="2942.68" data-end_ts="2942.72" title="2942.68" id=c_"2942.68">__them__</span>. I do enjoy working on them. Don't get me wrong. I still do that. It just takes away from a time. So what, what ended up happening to replace that? <span style="color:red" data-ts="2952.94" data-end_ts="2953.16" title="2952.94" id=c_"2952.94">__Oh__</span>, you know, that constant repair of, you know, Hey, how many PCs, threes can I own? Mm-hmm. <affirmative> that, that are breaking right now as I'm looking at it, you know, I'm getting rid of those and I'm gonna start building my own stuff that's stable. I can get parts for, and quite frankly, is far more flexible than any of those other devices of that time. You know, there's still things I, I really enjoy. There's, I'm looking at an expander. I still have more to go. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2980.24" data-end_ts="2980.36" title="2980.24" id=c_"2980.24">__So__</span> I'll go, there's now a new emulation for it. Maybe I'll like that better. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, I don't know. Right. When I play 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You, you, you aren't religious about these things, is what you're saying. No. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Right. No, there's, there's a set of tourist threes right here next to my, my foot, you know, and, when I play with the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2997.22" data-end_ts="2997.44" title="2997.22" id=c_"2997.22">__CRT__</span> rock band, and when I played with dweller, I, you know, the last time we played in Europe, I was, I had my voyager with me. So, but right next to a <span style="color:red" data-ts="3006.88" data-end_ts="3007.08" title="3006.88" id=c_"3006.88">__nor__</span> modular, you can live in both worlds. It's okay <laugh>. If, if, if more people thought like this <span style="color:red" data-ts="3012.52" data-end_ts="3012.68" title="3012.52" id=c_"3012.52">__is__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3012.7" data-end_ts="3012.92" title="3012.7" id=c_"3012.7">__be__</span>, there'd be a heck of a lot less fighting in the world. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So the modular stuff are, are you saying most of the stuff you have is things that you built? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Well, I went after, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Or do you mix and match? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>I mix and match. I see. But the, it started in earnest, I'm gonna call it earnest with the, ASM ones. I don't know if you remember those. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, yes, I do. Absolutely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>And, was that Gene, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Was <span style="color:red" data-ts="3038.44" data-end_ts="3038.56" title="3038.44" id=c_"3038.44">__that__</span> gene stop 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Or Gene Stop? Yeah, I did three of those. And I had actually gotten to the point where I was thinking about manufacturing them. Most of the, that stuff was all electro noes. Right. It was very easy to customize, to make your own, if you had to. I'm not gonna say I'm the world's greatest designer. They do have certain ideas, that may or may not be unique, but, you know, occasionally, with the electro <span style="color:red" data-ts="3066.15" data-end_ts="3066.44" title="3066.15" id=c_"3066.15">__note__</span> stuff, it <span style="color:red" data-ts="3067.32" data-end_ts="3067.48" title="3067.32" id=c_"3067.32">__just__</span>, they, they kind of like give you a basic, Hey, here's a great, you know, sawtooth, core oscillator, you know, and then this, this, this fine gentleman, Paul Schreiber started doing the M O T M stuff. I kind of got rid of everything else. A divorce, got rid of my large doer system mm-hmm. <affirmative>, and, like I stuck with the five <span style="color:red" data-ts="3091.12" data-end_ts="3091.24" title="3091.12" id=c_"3091.12">__r__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3091.32" data-end_ts="3091.44" title="3091.32" id=c_"3091.32">__u__</span> stuff and kept building Paul Schreiber's, you know, kits synth <span style="color:red" data-ts="3095.64" data-end_ts="3096.4" title="3095.64" id=c_"3095.64">__tech.com__</span>. Everyone, Paul would offer, and not very many people knew about this, but you could buy prototyping kits, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3105.7" data-end_ts="3105.92" title="3105.7" id=c_"3105.7">__you__</span> know, front panel mounting hardware, a protoboard with the appropriate power connector, appropriate places to put pots on so you can mount 'em meas easily using a M O T m, assembly conventions. Right. And you can design and build your own stuff on those. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_02: </b>Oh, interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>So, so I started doing both, right. And then other people, I mean, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3131.99" data-end_ts="3132.28" title="3131.99" id=c_"3131.99">__this__</span> stuff started to take off before the euro, rack thing happened, which I think is both a blessing and a curse to the electronic music community. There were people selling boards, Jurgen Hebel for one, who was, probably one of the best, I'm gonna say one of the best, most relatively unknown synthesize synthesizer designers in the world. And, his designs were never clones. He wouldn't, he wouldn't like open up, a box and go, I will do this exact same thing on a new, you know, on a new circuit board and everyone will have it. Ha ha ha ha. No, he would do is he goes, this is what they were doing, and this is the effect that they got. I'm gonna do the same thing using my own design. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>And he would get <span style="color:red" data-ts="3187.75" data-end_ts="3188.04" title="3187.75" id=c_"3187.75">__some__</span> stuff. So spot on, in the case of like his trapezoid generator, I've got, four of those, basically. They're, they're wonderful. They perfectly emulate, a VCs three, the trapezoid generator of VCs three. So my friend Jeffrey McKee and I, about three years ago, started basically silk screening our own panels or having them done cu our own aluminum, and then either boards, boards <span style="color:red" data-ts="3217.28" data-end_ts="3217.4" title="3217.28" id=c_"3217.28">__of__</span>, or circuits of our own design and or other people's, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3221.45" data-end_ts="3221.8" title="3221.45" id=c_"3221.45">__print__</span> circuit boards. Where <span style="color:red" data-ts="3222.56" data-end_ts="3222.68" title="3222.56" id=c_"3222.56">__I__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3222.68" data-end_ts="3222.88" title="3222.68" id=c_"3222.68">__had__</span> to do is just essentially get the bill of materials and buy, get 'em all parts, and then stuff the boards, and then modify if you need it or make it your own. Somehow you end up with a, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3235.28" data-end_ts="3235.4" title="3235.28" id=c_"3235.28">__a__</span>, a nice, you know, five ru panel that can be mounted up with the rest of your stuff that would interoperate with it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>There's a number of people doing this in Portland, as a matter of fact, but unfortunately, there isn't as much five ru development as there is, Euro rack stuff, which to me is mostly if, if all you Euro lovers, you know, that are listening all six of you, you know, I'm not saying your stuff is shit with an e <laugh>, but I'm gonna say a lot of it is shit with an E you know, <laugh>, a lot of that, that stuff is up. I mean, nobody's decided on, you know, standardizing levels. It, it, it's all surface mount stuff that's just barely functional. The engineers not always the, you know, sharpest guys out there doing stuff. I mean, if you're gonna, if you're gonna, you know, have that kind of crap in your racks, like I do, do it yourself, why, why, why pay somebody else, you know, to, for their crap. Why, why, why give them the incentive to create really, really, really bad Euro rack modules? But on the other hand, there's a lot of that stuff out there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's funny though. I mean, on one hand it, I, I started off definitely with five <span style="color:red" data-ts="3312.76" data-end_ts="3312.88" title="3312.76" id=c_"3312.76">__u__</span> stuff for my travel rig. I use, a euro rack set up, but I still have a, a fairly significant five U <span style="color:red" data-ts="3320.62" data-end_ts="3320.84" title="3320.62" id=c_"3320.62">__set__</span> up. I think that, in a way, starting off with the Syntec with the modem stuff mm-hmm. <affirmative> sort of like sets you up to be less happy with anything else. Because one of the things Paul does, Paul is like anal retentive about things like mm-hmm. <affirmative> level management and level standardization and the, the torque requirements for pots and stuff like that. <laugh>, he's, he's just a nut job about that. And, and if you dare tell him that his idea might stand some modification, he will have a 45 minute rant to tell you exactly why he's right. And you know what, in the end you're like, oh yeah, I guess you're right, man, you know, <laugh> or he's <span style="color:red" data-ts="3371.6" data-end_ts="3371.72" title="3371.6" id=c_"3371.6">__a__</span> guy 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>That, or after 45 minutes he will have talked himself into, talked to 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Himself <span style="color:red" data-ts="3376.92" data-end_ts="3377.12" title="3376.92" id=c_"3376.92">__and__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3377.12" data-end_ts="3377.24" title="3377.12" id=c_"3377.12">__into__</span> something else. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Yeah. Yeah. Because, not always, believe me, he's right. More, more than he's ever been wrong. Right. So, but I, I think I, I, I, I'm trying to remember at least one discussion we've had, where he has reversed his position, but it's like once, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Yeah. So, but you know, that, that <span style="color:red" data-ts="3398.34" data-end_ts="3398.62" title="3398.34" id=c_"3398.34">__kinda__</span> sets you up then for, you know, when you get into stuff where you have tons of mixed manufacturers or, you know, not necessarily the greatest quality control of, of just looking at that and being like, well, this doesn't even feel like it has any quality to it at all, you know, so. Yeah. Well, my God, there's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Lots of memo Tmm on the new album. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Is there? Really? Yeah. Oh, that's cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, Dave, we have spent far more time than I expected. The time just blew away because in fact, this was just, you're, you're fun guy to talk to. And, I had a great, great time just kind of skating around conceptually all over everything. I still would love to talk to you more about some, about, you know, some of the other collaborations you've done. And one of the things I was going to try and nail you down on, we talked about it a bit by accident, is how you decide when your work is done. But I have a feeling that that's probably a longer discussion than, than we can have right now. So I think what I'm gonna do is save that discussion for the next time we talk, be good. 'cause <span style="color:red" data-ts="3468.66" data-end_ts="3468.7" title="3468.66" id=c_"3468.66">__then__</span> we're wanna have have you on again. This is a lot of fun. And we, we opened a lot of interesting doors. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Cool. Well, thank you for having me. It's been enjoyable and yeah, maybe I'll have you on on my show sometime. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That'd be cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Talk to you later. Bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>There you go. Another chat, recorded Chomped up, divvied up and sent out to you the listener. I hope that you enjoyed that as much as I did. Dave's just a fantastic guy. It seems like there's no end of, discussions to be had. Looking forward to talking to him again in the hopefully near future. I want to thank again all the listeners for tuning in. It's been pretty fantastic. I'm not sure how you get hold of this podcast, but if you could do me a favor, if you, get this through iTunes, if you could jump over to iTunes and just give me a really nice rating. First of all, that's a good pat on the head, but secondly, that makes the podcast, more easily found for other people. And, sure would like to make sure that interested parties get a chance to hear these interviews. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I think they're fantastic, wonderful insight into the way that creative people work. And I'd like to share this as much as possible. Other than that, I thank you for your continued support. Thanks again to opia, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3567.2" data-end_ts="3567.6" title="3567.2" id=c_"3567.2">__create__</span> digital music and all the other great, sites that help, spread the word about what we're doing. And, next week I'm off to namm. So we, I'm not sure if podcast is gonna get out. If so, it's going to be, probably pretty low production quality because I'll be doing it from some ridiculous hotel room in Anaheim. But nevertheless, if you happen to be out in namm, reach out to me either via email, which is DDG at cycling <span style="color:red" data-ts="3598" data-end_ts="3598.52" title="3598" id=c_"3598">__74__</span>, or you can hit me up, on Facebook where I am simply Darwin Gross or Twitter, or I'm Darwin Gross, all one word. I hope I get a chance to see you. If not, you can always shoot me email, just out of fun anyway. But thank you so much and I'll catch you soon.
