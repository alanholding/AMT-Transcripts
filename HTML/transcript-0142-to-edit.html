<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, today I have the pleasure of talking to one of my favorite people in whole world. His name's Terry Pender He works at Columbia, but he also does about a bazillion other things. He's, a super active musician. He's super active in, in the area of academics. And, recently in writing he's about to kick off a, a course with cadenza that is going to be about the history of recording and recording music. So I'm really excited about that. I am definitely taking it. It sounds incredible. So with that, I want to introduce you to Terry Pender Hey Terry. How are you today? Great. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Terry Pender: </b>How are you doing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm doing fine. Thank you so much for coming to hang out on the podcast. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Terry: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="60.105" data-end_ts="60.325" title="60.105" id=c_"60.105">__Oh__</span>, it's my pleasure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, let's start off by talking about all the things that you're currently doing, because my knowledge of you is that you actually have done or are doing about 400 things at any given time. So, <laugh> Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So why don't we talk about what you're working on right now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Terry: </b>Okay. I'm kind of <span style="color:red" data-ts="81.645" data-end_ts="81.765" title="81.645" id=c_"81.645">__a__</span>, I'm one of the great behind the scenes people, I think in electronic music and in interactive music. There's just so much to do. So I'm the associate director at the Computer Music Center at, Columbia University, where I also work with our sound arts program, which we just started three years ago. So I have a lot of teaching responsibilities and working directly with those students. Also at Columbia University, I help run this <span style="color:red" data-ts="107.325" data-end_ts="107.565" title="107.325" id=c_"107.325">__Alice__</span> m Tson fund, which is a philanthropic organization, which gives money for new music performances and presentations. And I also work at Columbia, where I run the Pulitzer Prize in music meetings, each year here. So this last year, Henry Threadgill won the Pulitzer Prize. So that's kind of my academic work, which is a pretty full plate. On top of that, I do try to play professionally. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Terry: </b>I'm a mandolin player, guitar player in harmonica mainly. And I've had a long standing trio. I think we're just celebrating our 10th year now, called PGT. And that's me, Terry Pender and then Greg Taylor and Brad Garten. Brad Garten is the director of the center here at Columbia University. And Brad and I have worked together, oh, I've been at Columbia for 20 years and we had worked at the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music for about three years before that. So Brad and I have worked together as a team basically for 23 years. Gregory Taylor is another good friend of ours that we've met at the International Computer Music Conferences in the old days. And Gregory Taylor also works for Cycling 74. We are big users of Cycling 74 software. I teach, here at Columbia Interactive Sounded video, which is a basically a a max class. And, so the three of us have got together about 10 years ago to explore the idea of trying to have an interactive band. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Terry: </b>Several years ago, one of my former students, Luke Debois and I, were at a conference, and this is at the beginning of interactivity. And we are watching people perform, quote unquote interactive pieces, and they all seem kind of canned to me, or they're doing interactivity based on percentages or, you know, weighted randomness or whatnot. But it wasn't truly interactive in the sense that, say, a normal improvisation is interactive. So I came up with this idea that I wanted to be a performer and have my sound completely controlled by the other members of the group so that I would basically, I would be able to play, I'd be able to do <span style="color:red" data-ts="225.765" data-end_ts="225.925" title="225.765" id=c_"225.765">__what__</span> I ever I wanted to, but they would have control over that. And we did our first, our first version of this, we called it the Terry Pender Orchestra. And it was, again, with Brad Luke Dubal was one of the processors at the time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Terry: </b>He was a student, another student, Doug <span style="color:red" data-ts="238.895" data-end_ts="239.245" title="238.895" id=c_"238.895">__Geers__</span>, who is now the Dean of Brooklyn College Computer Music Center, I think. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. He was the third person. So we did this at the kitchen in New York City where I went out with electric guitar. I sent my signal to all three of them. They had three different means of processing my signal and they could decide whether to turn me up, turn me down, turn the processing up. And so I walked out to improvise, basically. And then they had complete control of my sound, and then I had to deal with that. So I was very interested in kind of really pushing this interactive idea where you are actually giving up control at some level. And I've always been an improviser and I think, you know, improvising electronic music if <span style="color:red" data-ts="276.825" data-end_ts="277.045" title="276.825" id=c_"276.825">__so__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="277.045" data-end_ts="277.205" title="277.045" id=c_"277.045">__that__</span> the more, the more I can hand off that interactivity to other people, I can concentrate solely then on my performance. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Terry: </b>Sure. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="284.405" data-end_ts="284.565" title="284.405" id=c_"284.405">__so__</span> to be really in the moment, then also to react against whatever's gonna be thrown at me or the fact that I could be on stage. And this happened to me one night with Luke Daugh where I was up on stage and I'm playing and just absolutely nothing is coming out. And he had set up a process where he had a booklet sequence running, and my notes would only go through if I happened to play one. One of the notes of the booklet played <span style="color:red" data-ts="304.245" data-end_ts="304.405" title="304.245" id=c_"304.245">__and__</span> it opened up a gate for me. Okay. So, so part of the performance was me on stage in front of an audience, figuring out how that system worked, Uhhuh, in order to get sound out. So it's even to that extreme where it's like, nothing's gonna happen. And I didn't, they didn't tell me that ahead of time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Terry: </b>So I had to figure it out. I started playing really fast. What's nothing's coming out? Oh, every fourth note's coming out. Oh, oh. You know, so it's kind of a fun thing. So it's a bit of a game in a sense, but also I think it's then you're really improvising and it's truly interactive. Right. So the, the other idea is just that idea of ambient music, which Gregory Taylor and Brad Garten and I love, I had done some time playing with Robert Fripp in the League of Crafty Guitarists. Brad and Gregory are extremely influenced by, by Brian Eno. So we decided also to put those ideas of the ambient music that Fripp <span style="color:red" data-ts="353.605" data-end_ts="353.725" title="353.605" id=c_"353.605">__and__</span> Eno had created, but to do it live. So again, we needed a live instrumentalist and we needed our processors instead of the two Reox tape recorders. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, we kind of just, just started doing this ourselves so that we could create a, a body of music that was live, live ambient music that we then I would go back and, and mix and produce more or less. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Very interesting. You, you guys have traveled all over the place doing that work too, haven't you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Terry: </b>We played extensively in Portugal for about three years. We went back each year. We were playing in, in several rural areas and both teaching classes and giving workshops and then giving concerts. And that, that was really interesting. The man who was booking us for these concerts, when he saw that we were interested in this improvisation idea as well, he actually set up our third, tour over there to Portugal. He set up a series of dates where we would play the first half of the show, and then the second half would have an intermission. And then when the second half of the show opened, I would walk out from one age of the one end of the stage, and somebody I had never met before would walk out from the other end of the stage, a famous port Portuguese musician. Okay. And then we would start playing and performing and improvise on stage together with Brad and Gregory doing the processing. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So that was really exciting too. 'cause we played with these fabulous Portuguese guitarists and, you know, traditional instruments, and they were all game for it. And it was just, you know, it created a type of music that I, I just don't think we would ever have imagined creating on our own. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Now, in addition to all of that, you have recently been working on sort of like collecting the stories and the information around the history of recorded music. We've been talking over the years and you're actually working on a book project in that regards, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Terry: </b>Yeah. I, I would say my main area of research is the history of recording production techniques. Okay. So, I, like many of us, I'm obsessed with echo. I'm obsessed with reverb, <span style="color:red" data-ts="468.325" data-end_ts="468.445" title="468.325" id=c_"468.325">__and__</span> I'm obsessed with doubling and these interesting recording studios, basic recording studios, techniques we can do Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But I was also very interested about when did these things start occurring and who, who were the originators of some of these techniques? You know, why, why do we have compression? Who invented compression <laugh>? Where did it come from with this idea that I, I have a better sense of the history of what the need was to create these devices or these techniques, understand who the original innovators were and how they use the techniques. And then see how they can be, you know, updated. So we could do them on our laptops or whatnot, and how we can use them in a innovative way today. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Terry: </b>You know, it's like, just <span style="color:red" data-ts="509.285" data-end_ts="509.405" title="509.285" id=c_"509.285">__to__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="509.475" data-end_ts="509.765" title="509.475" id=c_"509.475">__case__</span>, say a simple example. You know, logic has all these great compressors in it. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, they're clearly different, but they really don't tell you that much about it. So I spent a lot of time researching all those compressors to find out what they're modeled on. You go back to those models here, the settings on those models. And I think if you start using the, you know, the, the proper settings, you can get a lot further then of course, do whatever you want. But if you understand what they're trying to model in each case, I think you can use it more effectively. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, that's actually kind of an interesting point because so oftentimes these things are kind of thrown down without any contextualization. And so, unless you're either willing to just hit the presets or do that kind of background research, you may never be able to actually get the best out of any of these processors. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Terry: </b>Yeah. And it's, it, you know, we're in a, it's a great thing and a terrible thing at the same time with, yeah. Bad <span style="color:red" data-ts="565.645" data-end_ts="565.845" title="565.645" id=c_"565.645">__thing__</span> with any software, but logic has all these great sounds in it, but they have so many effects already put in place that, you know, if you ever bring up a sample or you bring up one of their instruments, you really have to go in and strip everything off again. 'cause they sound great when they're solo, but they don't sound good in the context, of a mix. You know? 'cause they have too much reverb and the reverb's not eqd, and it's not pre delayed and, you know, everything else. So the sounds sound luscious and really inviting by themselves, but they don't blend that well once you get to the mixing stage. So I think, you know, just the basic things like going back with reverb, just all the amazing ways that you can use reverb, but then to also make sure that they know, to eq it, to pre <span style="color:red" data-ts="606.335" data-end_ts="606.685" title="606.335" id=c_"606.335">__delay__</span> it, how, how you wanna use reverb differently on voice than on an instrument. How to balance the natural reverb of a room with the artificial reverb you can put in. And then even with a convolution reverb, doing fun things like using strange <span style="color:red" data-ts="621.185" data-end_ts="621.605" title="621.185" id=c_"621.185">__import__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="621.605" data-end_ts="621.925" title="621.605" id=c_"621.605">__impulse__</span> responses that are not really room sounds, but can create interesting convolution ideas with your reverbs <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. Now, I, I think it's interesting that you're pointing out logic because logic, and, you know, I think of Ableton Live <span style="color:red" data-ts="636.105" data-end_ts="636.325" title="636.105" id=c_"636.105">__is__</span> doing this too. They have sort of this meta <span style="color:red" data-ts="640.395" data-end_ts="640.885" title="640.395" id=c_"640.395">__effects__</span> where you select something and all of a sudden you've inadvertently like dropped 10 effects on your track. And you're right, it makes that one track sound phenomenal, but it also sounds really out of place when you put it in a mix. To what extent do you, are, are you concerned with the, the techniques of mixing? Or are you mostly really focusing on, the effects processors and how they came, you know, what, what their historical route has been? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Terry: </b>It, it's really both. I mean, my, my, my ultimate goal is, is really a good mix. Always. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And so that, that's the students, by the time they get to me, they should already know how to use logic. And so <span style="color:red" data-ts="681.845" data-end_ts="682.085" title="681.845" id=c_"681.845">__then__</span> now I'm really trying to help them refine a mix. And part and parcel with that is to really go through all the different effects devices and, and give them a good sense of how, how they were, how they've been used traditionally, and then ideas of how we could use them any way we want. But again, just understanding when they're used, how they're used, listening to all the interesting ways that they were used, and be being able, I mean, part of it, I think for me is listening to a mix and being able to identify what you hear. So in a, in a sense, it's partially a digital orchestration course as well, so that when I hear a piece, I say, oh, that's a pumping compressor there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Terry: </b>That sounds, <span style="color:red" data-ts="720.065" data-end_ts="720.285" title="720.065" id=c_"720.065">__oh__</span>, that's, is that a chorus or a flange? Oh, yes, that's a flange. And over here, you know, so I, I wanna make sure when students listen to that music, they know exactly what they hear. <span style="color:red" data-ts="730.705" data-end_ts="730.925" title="730.705" id=c_"730.705">__And__</span>, and especially with a lot of the newer EDM and hip hop music, you know, I have students all the time bringing in a song saying, what's happening right here? What do you think that sound is? <laugh>, you know, <laugh>. And so we go through that kind of deconstruction process to figure out, oh, here's what I think they're doing. Right. And a and a lot of it you can do, just being knowledgeable, knowledgeable about the, the techniques, you know, that are somewhat independent of the genres. So, Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So I <span style="color:red" data-ts="755.925" data-end_ts="756.125" title="755.925" id=c_"755.925">__want__</span> to, I'm gonna want to dig into that further because what you've kind of are talking about there is almost like sound design, CSI or something. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Terry: </b><laugh>, that's, no, you're right. You're right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Which is really great. And I want to talk a little more about that. But before we get there, in addition to all this stuff, I mean, you have this history as sort of like a very accomplished mandolin player and guitarist, that's worked with a lot of amazing people. You somehow, like, came through the system and, and really came to understand computer music and electronics. And I am curious about your background and, and where you come from, because frankly, the, the more I learn about you, the more I think that you actually are much like sun <span style="color:red" data-ts="798.025" data-end_ts="798.245" title="798.025" id=c_"798.025">__raw__</span> and that you just dropped in from Saturn and, with, with centuries of information already inside of your skull. Right. I need to understand where you come from and, and how it is that you can be so accomplished in so many things and have had so many great experiences. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Terry: </b>Who knows, <span style="color:red" data-ts="817.805" data-end_ts="817.925" title="817.805" id=c_"817.805">__this__</span> is a little hard to talk about, but let's try to figure it out. I think part of it is, I've moved around a lot in my life as <span style="color:red" data-ts="824.165" data-end_ts="824.325" title="824.165" id=c_"824.165">__that__</span> when I was a child, we never lived anywhere for more than three or four years at a time. So I, I moved around a lot. I've lived in interesting places. I was born in Chicago, in the city. My family is Irish. I was exposed to a lot of Irish music early on. Then I lived in New Jersey, Northern New Jersey during late, late middle school, the beginning of high school during their whole kind of rock revolution thing. And then I moved to Cincinnati in the middle of high school where all that stuff didn't seem to exist. And I got very involved in bluegrass and whatnot. But I've played all my life more or less starting with guitar. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Terry: </b>And my, I was initially drawn to a acoustic blues guitar. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I spent a lot of, a lot of time playing guitar in harmonica Senator Terry Brandon McGee, Reverend Gary Davis, and doing, of course, all the electric stuff. I got very much into electric blues. I started playing in bands, probably when I was about 16 years old. I started playing in bars in Cincinnati as a rock and roll guitar player. I was very interested in effects. I didn't have a lot of money. And so I, I tried to really use the effects as innovatively as I could because I didn't have the ability to buy a lot of, also, at the time, I would say I was very naive in a sense. So things like backwards guitar, sounds on Beatles record or something like that. I didn't really understand how they did that. And I didn't really try to think about it that much. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Terry: </b>So if I wanted to play one of those guitar solos, I just tried to learn it on a regular guitar with a regular echo or <laugh>, you know? Right. So we just <span style="color:red" data-ts="910.325" data-end_ts="910.565" title="910.325" id=c_"910.325">__tried__</span> to start doing everything we possibly could. And I don't know how it happened, but I got into improvising really even avant-garde improvising when I was in high school. Part of that was this idea of Robert Fripp and King Crimson and Brian Eno. I was very much into that as soon as it started. And, you know, with tape recorders and electric guitar and stuff, it seems like, you know, you could easily do that. I was a kid with my cassette recorder recording everything. And so one of the things is I really spent a lot of time learning different kinds of music. I spent a lot of time trying to become a really proficient blues player. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Terry: </b>I spent a lot of time trying to become a really proficient rock and roll player. And I spent a good 10 or 15 years on each of those things. And now I kind of just kind of bounce back between them all. I think the other thing from moving around a lot is I'm a little quiet on one level, but I'm just soaking in everything from every source and resource that I can. So the nice thing about meeting Brad Garten is we did travel all over the world. And I got to meet most of the great computer musicians and a lot of the great musicians through him. And I would be that kind of person who would be sitting in the, in the corner of the room, kind of quiet and aloof maybe. But I was really listening and soaking everything in and all the ideas that they were discussing, just trying to internalize 'em and decide, oh, how could I make use of that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Terry: </b>Or, oh, that's an interesting idea and if I change this, these three things, then that would really maybe be more interesting and can make it work. So we were taking a lot of these kind of theoretical conversations and ideas. And then I would come back and try to stick it into a piece or into an improvisation and get it to work with PGT or, or on my own. Sure. I guess part and parcel that goes along with that is then I did, I have done quite a bit of sound design work for art films for a group called the Open-Ended Group, which today, I think is Paul Kaiser and Mark Downey. They've gone through some changes, but I did, most of the sound design for them for a good 10 year period. And we have a really solid seven or eight pieces that have been touring the world, you know, for the past 15 years. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Terry: </b>Sure. And they are very, they, they do motion capture animations. We've done them with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1036.185" data-end_ts="1036.605" title="1036.185" id=c_"1036.185">__Billie__</span> Jones, the choreographer. They did some with Merc Cunningham, and they're these beautiful art animations based on motion capture. And they were very severe about how they wanted sound used. They would each send me back three pages of notes at second 22, I like this, don't like that. Do more of this, do more of that. And at first it was scary 'cause I thought, wow, they don't like anything I'm doing. But what I learned was they knew exactly what they wanted and what they were really good at was number one, not saying, Hey, that's good, that's bad, but this is good. We like that because of this. Do more of that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's interesting to get that kind of feedback and also to be around people that are that disciplined. Because in a way, it's sort of like the, the current, the current world doesn't lend itself towards being accepting of discipline. Right. It's almost like, man, everybody should get to do what they want to do, which is very liberating, but at the same time sometimes doesn't push you into, into exceeding your own personal expectations. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Terry: </b>Yeah. I think that's absolutely correct and true and in, and in a lot of ways, I think that's why it was a pretty formidable experience of me working with them because when, when they like something, they loved it and they would be your champion <span style="color:red" data-ts="1111.895" data-end_ts="1112.115" title="1111.895" id=c_"1111.895">__to__</span> the end of the world. Right. If they didn't like something, you know, me, I would go back and I would try to slip it into the second mix. Right. And I get that note again the second time. No, you know, I would try to change it in a way that I thought they would then like it, I would do that a second time, and I maybe even would do it a third time occasionally. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1130.615" data-end_ts="1130.835" title="1130.615" id=c_"1130.615">__So__</span> I thought, I said, okay, I get it. You completely don't like what I'm doing there, and I'm gonna start again. Right. But that really did help kind of sink into what, what is, what are we trying to accomplish and what am I trying, what message am I trying to send with the sound in conjunction to the movement? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Terry: </b>And how am I trying to ground this animated figure in space so that it actually seems realistic and believable? And once you get into kind of this different way of looking at it, it, it does make a lot of sense. And I think you can really structure a, this is gonna sound really corny, but, just a higher level artwork when you have a team of people really looking at it that critically and working together. And so since a lot of what I do with today with my music is improvised and with PGT and is pretty loose, having that other side helps me keep on balance. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="1186.335" data-end_ts="1186.555" title="1186.335" id=c_"1186.335">__in__</span>, in a sense, I bring a lot of that discipline to PGT than when I'm, when I'm playing in mixing. Right. Because I know that as we perform, I'm just that type of person that as we start going, I, I just, I get a trajectory in my mind. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Terry: </b>And, again, it's a very interactive group. So my signal and my sound can disappear, can come back when I played five minutes ago, can come back to me in a different key and backwards and upside down. So I have to kind of know where I've been, but I can really kind of traverse that area much better. 'cause I then bring that discipline from the sound design and video work to what I'm doing with PGT and I'm listening really carefully and trying to really then take the process, how can I turn this now I don't <span style="color:red" data-ts="1231.315" data-end_ts="1231.435" title="1231.315" id=c_"1231.315">__lean__</span> into a performance, but then into a composition. And then since I go back afterwards and I'm the person who does the actual mixing, I can really push that a lot further. You know, we just, we just did a session about two weeks ago, a recording session, and Brad was questioning a lot of the processing that I had on this track that I did with the ukulele. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Terry: </b>He goes, it's not there at first. And it gradually comes in. It's like, no, I really want it to come from the mandolin. So I, I mean, from the ukulele. So I want the ukulele start. Once I explained it, he understood it completely. Sure. But I think he was also a little surprised that I, I had this whole kind of game plan in mind as well. But that helps, you know, it keeps our <span style="color:red" data-ts="1266.665" data-end_ts="1267.085" title="1266.665" id=c_"1266.665">__improv__</span> improvisation somewhat compositionally structured. And I think that's what makes PGT maybe a little bit more interesting than your average improvisers or something. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So I'm always curious with somebody who has both a playing and a recording, you know, a desire for both playing and recording, which is the thing that gets you off most, do you, do you play so that you can record? Or do you record so that you can play and spread the word about your playing? You know, it, it's sort of like a lot, you know, for me, I, I like playing, but it's, it's recording and sound design and those kind of things that I really love. Right. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and a lot of times playing is, is sort of like an avenue to, to almost like excite that procedure. Yeah. What is, what is your, where do you come from? Where do you sit on that continuum? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Terry: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1322.805" data-end_ts="1322.925" title="1322.805" id=c_"1322.805">__I__</span>, I'm really in the middle because I still am going out and playing in a more traditional manner, I guess. So right now, the thing I've been doing for the last year and a half or so is I've become very interested in the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1335.805" data-end_ts="1335.925" title="1335.805" id=c_"1335.805">__kinda__</span> the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1336.085" data-end_ts="1336.365" title="1336.085" id=c_"1336.085">__jungle__</span> Reinhardt, gypsy jazz guitar thing. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So I have been going every weekend up to SUNY New <span style="color:red" data-ts="1342.045" data-end_ts="1342.245" title="1342.045" id=c_"1342.045">__Pulse__</span> and playing with these gypsy jazz guys. You know, no computers, no nothing. It's, you know, we're not even recording. So it's just for the fun of, of playing and performing and improvising. And I love to do that. But with the PGT stuff and that, it's, it's really, to me it's more about the recording and the mixing. I, I love to mix, I love to do sound design, you know, and I guess that's maybe why the performances are interesting. 'cause I'm trying to think of all these little things that we can put in there that will then be fun to mix <laugh>. Right. We'll make good and we'll make good compositions. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. It's actually interesting because what you talk about when you talk about sort of like doing almost real time sound design or whatever. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, one of, one of the things that I've always conjectured is that, if you look at a lot of the great producers and like Lanois <span style="color:red" data-ts="1391.285" data-end_ts="1391.445" title="1391.285" id=c_"1391.285">__as__</span> a person, I think of immediately Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But there's a lot of examples of this. There are, there's a preponderance of people who are very accomplished producers that are bass players. Right? Yeah. I've always thought it's because the role of a bass player in a band is one that's almost like real time production, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1414.125" data-end_ts="1414.285" title="1414.125" id=c_"1414.125">__bass__</span>, a bass player can either follow along and not pay attention or actually really drive the, the sound of a band just through very subtle means. Right. And I always thought that that set a person up to be a very strong producer. It sounds like that's kind of, you, you kind of take that same approach when you're working with the PGT thing, which is that through sort of like subtle, subtle movements, you actually kind of draw people into different directions or are able to kind of push them in different directions. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Terry: </b>Yeah. And I mean, if, again, you have to have the personnel to do that. And I'm very fortunate that both Gregory Taylor and Brad Gartner, they're, you know, they're ready to go, basically. They're like, sure, throw something, Mattis. Let, let's get going. And, you know, see what, see what you can do Pender. And so I, I like that. And I, and I think they, they enjoy it as well. So it is challenging. I mean, one of the things we talked about, Gregory was just out here about two weeks ago, and we had figured out that we've been doing this for about 10 years, but the recordings that we did were, we all thought were significantly different. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And so there is, you know, we've got this body of material now that we can really go back and look at. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="1483.525" data-end_ts="1483.645" title="1483.525" id=c_"1483.525">__there__</span>, there truly is growth and things are changing and evolving still. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Terry: </b>So that's kind of a, you know, that's just a happy thing to recognize and to see. So I was just thinking, the other end about that, the discipline angle is kind of before I went back into academia, I did spend time, doing music for, for television. So for a while I was doing music for the soap operas, for the guiding Light, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1509.245" data-end_ts="1509.405" title="1509.245" id=c_"1509.245">__the__</span> search for Tomorrow, and all my, all my children. Yes. They've all since gone off the air. I, I don't think it was because of my music, but it's possible <laugh>. But that, that was the same type of thing where we were, we would go into a studio with a friend of mine late at night after they were closed, and we would try to produce one minute of sound design that we could then send to the music producer at the, at the television station here in New York. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Terry: </b>And then they would, they would pull that depending on what they did. And I never listened. I didn't even have a TV at the time, so we were writing this music. But again, it was this discipline thing where you're looking at five seconds of music and 10 seconds of music and seeing what the trajectory of that is as compared to the minute, as compared to the, the show or something. So it, it is a different way of, of looking at the function of music and how it functions in different, I guess, in different emotions and in different, I don't know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Different. Was that, was that doing like stingers or little sound effect things? Or like the, you know, when something strange is happening? Is it that kind of thing? Or? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Terry: </b>No, I was doing the, the background beds of the sound. Oh, I see. Okay. So I thought they, they were called soap cues. Okay. And, and, so in Subway it's the most anonymous music in the world in a sense. But I loved it because you could be more avantgarde, <laugh> <laugh> in what you're <span style="color:red" data-ts="1586.725" data-end_ts="1586.925" title="1586.725" id=c_"1586.725">__create__</span>. 'cause you're basically, you're creating music and labeling it per emotion for them to use, you know, 'cause Oh, he lost his memory. Oh, you know, the spaceman came down or all the crazy things that happened. Right. So I could really go to a lot of different places with it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well it's, that sounds fun because it's like, I mean, to go into a studio and say, well, you know, we're gonna compose a piece for coming out of the shower with a knife. Now. I mean, that really is a pretty open, open canvas, open paint upon <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Terry: </b>But, but on the other hand, you have to be really careful because you can do all sorts of interesting things, harmonically, texturally, but not rhythmically, not melodically necessarily. 'cause the text, the speech, it's a background. So that has to be upfront. You know, so again, it was this interesting early look at how at ambient music, say from a production aesthetic, not from, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1640.745" data-end_ts="1640.965" title="1640.745" id=c_"1640.745">__say__</span>, position aesthetic. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Recently, I, I did an interview with, Micah Frank, and he talked about how like, the biggest selling thing in Sample world is tools and loops and stuff that sort of provide <span style="color:red" data-ts="1655.525" data-end_ts="1656.085" title="1655.525" id=c_"1655.525">__ambience__</span>. And it, and it's really interesting that people in that world talk about ambient music. They use the same phrase, but it means a completely different thing because it, it does it, it's sort of like these things that bolster your awareness of an emotion or your, or bolsters your awareness of a mental state. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So I wanna talk, I wanna go back to something you talked about earlier, which is this idea of digital orchestration and working with your students in sort of figuring out the techniques, the techniques that they hear and doing that kind of like CSI that investigative work on existing recordings, first of all, and maybe the most obvious question is what is the thing that people ask you about the most? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Terry: </b>Usually it's, you know, with my undergraduates, there's some kind of odd compression and filtering combination to create some unusual, texture out of a vocal sample. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, all these little weird things where they can't quite figure, well, you know, what, what's happening here and how's that going on? And of course you can do so much with filtering, but the way they do the, they kind of combine it with this weird compression and pumping it's right. You know, it can be hard to grab sometimes. I guess part of what I'm doing to help that, and this goes back to the book or what I'm doing for Cadens, is I'm trying to create a canon, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1747.445" data-end_ts="1747.605" title="1747.445" id=c_"1747.445">__this__</span> sounds terribly boring in academic, but I'm trying to create a canon of production techniques. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So that when we talk about doubling, I, you can sit here are 15, 20 examples of great types of different types of doubling. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Terry: </b>When we talk about phase shifting or f flanging or echoing, or we talk about a plate reverb versus a spring reverb <span style="color:red" data-ts="1771.845" data-end_ts="1772.165" title="1771.845" id=c_"1771.845">__based__</span> versus an echo chamber versus a convolution reverb. Can we start to hear those things? So to grab all the music and say, all of this music was done using EMT plate reverbs. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, all of this, you know, this music was all done using, you know, a fender twin spring reverb or something. Right. Right. You know, here's where you can really hear vocal saturation on a James Brown recording or something. Right at this moment right here. That's what it sounds like. So number one, recognizing and building up a cannon so people have a reference of, you know, that first f flanging or the first doubling, the first echo, and how those <span style="color:red" data-ts="1807.365" data-end_ts="1807.565" title="1807.365" id=c_"1807.365">__were__</span>, and, and sometimes why they reused. Some of the early doubling stories have to do with musician strikes and, you know, odd things like that that don't really have anything to do with the music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Terry: </b>Right. But during a lot of the musician strikes, vocalists and harmonica players were often not considered musicians in the union <laugh>. So you could do all these acapella dates, or you could do these crazy blues harmonica dates when you couldn't do other recordings. Interesting. And the vocalists, if you couldn't hire other people, they, you know, with Bill Putnam and Patty Page, you know, he couldn't hire a background vocalist, so he just did it with her. Right. So sometimes it's just necessity is the mother of invention. But again, I think going back to those, those kind of critical moments, and my ultimate goal is for that idea for the students to develop a personal sound. 'cause to me, the most important thing, and this, this is an old story that really goes back to Les Paul, Les Paul's mother called him up one day and said, oh, I heard you on the radio. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Terry: </b>You're playing in Chicago last night, huh? He's like, no, I played in New York last night. She said, no, no, I heard you in Chicago. It was definitely, it was you on guitar. He's like, no, it wasn't me. It turned out to be George Barnes. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1872.165" data-end_ts="1872.285" title="1872.165" id=c_"1872.165">__And__</span> his mother was like, he's playing just like you. He's stealing your stuff. And Les Paul went back and thought, wow, my mother doesn't even know if it's me playing on on the radio or not. I have sound immediately identifiable. So whenever I come on my, the radio, my mother can say, oh yes, that's my boy Les playing <laugh>. And I say that to my students, if your music came on the radio, which your parents would your significant other be able to identify it as your music, a new piece, like that's your sound. Right. You know, we can do it with lots of people with Miles Davis, with Pat <span style="color:red" data-ts="1901.355" data-end_ts="1901.845" title="1901.355" id=c_"1901.355">__Mahaney__</span> with, I mean, with millions of people. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Terry: </b>They have this idea of a signature sound and they've created the sound and it's recognizable and hopefully it's new and different. So this idea then is I'm really trying to get them to, to look towards a personal sound, an overall personality that they can start to get that's unique and is their own. And to study people who have developed their own sound <span style="color:red" data-ts="1924.885" data-end_ts="1925.045" title="1924.885" id=c_"1924.885">__and__</span>, and get that idea of how we can do that. And part of that, I think is recognizing where you are in the history of music. I have this theory of music that things always start. They start, somebody comes up with a good idea. It's a simple idea. So lots of people can do it. And lots of people start to do it. And it becomes popular as more people develop this idea, it becomes more complex. Oh, let's do this to the idea, let's add a string section. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Terry: </b>Let's add drums, let's add samples, let's whatever. And the music becomes more and more and more complex until we finally get to a point where the music is so complex. Very few people can actually now perform that music anymore. And there's usually some kind of bifurcation where it breaks down. Right. And the complicated people go, but another group falls off. 'cause we're going back to basics. So it could be the punk rock <span style="color:red" data-ts="1972.035" data-end_ts="1972.325" title="1972.035" id=c_"1972.035">__move__</span> movement, you know? Mm-Hmm. The Seattle <span style="color:red" data-ts="1973.485" data-end_ts="1973.765" title="1973.485" id=c_"1973.485">__Center__</span>. We're always going back to <span style="color:red" data-ts="1974.695" data-end_ts="1975.045" title="1974.695" id=c_"1974.695">__bases__</span>. We're reacting against progressive rock or something else. In classical music, you could look at minimalism as that. In jazz, you could look at, you know, cool jazz, cool jazz. Right. You know, all that stuff. Going back more to melody, more to beat while other people still went on and pursued the more complicated avenue. So then what I'm trying to get my students to under, to, to, to try to decide for themselves, and I, I don't wanna tell 'em this is where are you in that continuum? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Terry: </b>Right? Are you pushing your music forward? Are you adding more things to it, you know, making it more diverse, or are you, are you wanna react against that and make your music simpler, purify it somehow. And so these production techniques we have to look at, because if you wanna pull back, you've gotta jet <span style="color:red" data-ts="2015.665" data-end_ts="2015.885" title="2015.665" id=c_"2015.665">__in__</span> these things. Yeah. And if you wanna go forward, you need have to learn how to use them in more innovative ways or in ways that people haven't before. You know, I have this whole weird idea of the history and where we are in the history and whether we're fighting the tide or going with the tide. And if the students have all that information, my hope is that then they will be able to create, you know, really create a musical personality that they can put out and be, be successful with. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That's actually a great way to put it too, because in fact, you're not actually referencing one direction over the other. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. If, if people, if people want to push forward, you're gonna help them figure out ways to do that. If they are going to, if they're going to revert to, purity. There's ways to do that too. I think that that's, that's actually a really neat way to present it, because otherwise it prevents you from running down the Prague rock poo hole. Right? Yeah. Where, you know, now it's like, it gets to the point where you can't, you can't even make an impression on people unless you like speed up your recordings and then find some way to cope with it live. Right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And so that's really, that's a really interesting way to, to pro provide that, that information. So that kind of talked, that started off in a discussion about what do people often ask for, what I'm curious is, is there anything that you wish people would ask for that they never do? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Terry: </b>I, I, I would have to say no. I mean, that's not, I'm not looking to, I mean, I'm a funny person. I, I feel best when I think I'm really helping somebody uhhuh <affirmative>. So in a lot of ways I like my younger, my undergraduate students and stuff, sometimes I like them better 'cause they're just so much more excited and they, there's so much they need to learn and want to learn, and they really take and run with everything. As opposed to a lot of the graduate students, you know, they have a lot of the tools and techniques they need, and at some point they're trying to distance themselves from their professors at that point. Right. So it's not so much that I'm, I'm looking for any specific, you know, it's, it's not like, oh, you may be really happy by asking that question or something <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Terry: </b>Right, right. To me it's more like the improvisation things. I've, one of the things that keeps my job interesting is every year they come up and they bring me these new records and, or they don't bring me records, but they bring me something, they bring me these new sound files and say, you know, Dr. Pender, what are they doing? Right. And generally, I haven't heard the music because I'm older now. And so it keeps me active in the music that's happening today. And generally I can usually figure it out. So it's, you know, I i, it's like, it's challenge. It's like the crossword puzzle or something. Right. So I like these challenges they bring in, how can we do that? And then we figure out what they did and then how they, how we can do it with the tools that we have available to us. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure, sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Terry: </b>I mean, that's just, that challenge is, that's, that's what I really like the most, I think. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. And then now finally, one last thing about your background, because again, you, you have touched, you, you sort of like have, entanglements into so many different parts of the musical world. I'm curious, like, going back to sort of the most influential things. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2212.215" data-end_ts="2212.505" title="2212.215" id=c_"2212.215">__What__</span>, what were the things that influenced you most? Were they recordings? Were they seeing people live? Was it maybe a piece of gear? You know, for me, when I go back, the two things that most changed the way I viewed the world was like, a Blue Oyster Cult Live album and the TEAC 33 40 recorder <laugh>. Right. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. It's a pretty odd combination. But those two things both launched me on a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2239.865" data-end_ts="2240.065" title="2239.865" id=c_"2239.865">__path__</span>, path of exploration that was really critical to what I became. What are the things that were influential in for you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Terry: </b>I guess a, a couple of things. One is when I, I moved to Cincinnati, Ohio when I was in my sophomore year of high school. And they, there is a excellent music conservatory there called the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music. And they had a lot of, they have many several, halls there and they do a ton of concerts and all their concerts are free. And they had a very good innovative music program there when I was in high school. And they would do all these John Cage concerts with the black earth percussion ensemble and a lot of synthesis stuff. So as a high school student, I was going down to the college because I could go to these concerts for free. Right. And it was a cool thing that your parents didn't mind you doing, you know, going to a concert at a college. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Terry: </b>Right. You know, you know, that type of concert. So I was exposed to a lot of, a lot of avantgarde classical music when I was in, in, in high school. And I was exposed to it through performances more so than through records. Sure. So I immediately, you know, like I always do, I tried to figure out what they were doing and how I could do that mostly with electric guitar and effects and whatnot and to try to build up as big a performance as I could. The second thing was about that same time the Fripp and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2327.725" data-end_ts="2327.885" title="2327.725" id=c_"2327.725">__Eno__</span> stuff came out and I started really seriously following that to the point that I eventually became a crafty guitarist and went down and studied with Robert Fripp, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2337.825" data-end_ts="2338.045" title="2337.825" id=c_"2337.825">__and__</span>, and did that whole thing with him. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and becoming a crafty guitarist. And that experience in a lot of ways is what made me decide to go back to music school. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Terry: </b>'cause I was pretty successful as a guitar player. I was doing the background music for television. I had a commission from the Whitney that I did a dance piece, but I just felt I couldn't break through where I was gonna be able to make a living once I did the fri stuff. Fripp was really big on just downtown minimalism, Steve Reich African drumming and all that kind <span style="color:red" data-ts="2369.565" data-end_ts="2369.685" title="2369.565" id=c_"2369.565">__of__</span> stuff. And he just exposed me to this whole different world of music. And part of the thing was he would set up these challenges, you know, you'd have lunch and he'd say, all right, tonight we're gonna play at this bar in Georgetown University. And so I kind of thrived in that circumstance. And so then I just kept pushing that. And that strangely enough led me to academia now. Too much of a homebody too, where I, I don't, I mean, I did spend time on the road and stuff and it's, I just don't have the personality for it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I, I think that that's maybe one of the things that's actually pretty exciting about the current state of, you know, of music and especially, you know, music of different, of many genres, is that there are opportunities to do this without spending 300 days on the road. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Terry: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, our time is well up already. I appreciate, I appreciate you taking the opportunity to talk. One last thing. Can you give us a little bit of a cue of what this cadenza course is gonna be about, when it's gonna start and, what people should expect? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Terry: </b>I've tried to put all my research into a book and, it was gonna come out on <span style="color:red" data-ts="2437.805" data-end_ts="2438.005" title="2437.805" id=c_"2437.805">__ledge__</span>. It's not going to happen now. And what I've done is I'm taking all this material and I'm reconfiguring it for an online video course through Cadens. So it is basically going through kind of the history of production. So there'll be some historical lectures, but then kind of a deep dive into things like reverb and echo compression, doubling some of the standard things, but really looking at them in depth and, and having a lot of musical examples and that idea of setting up the canon so there is a body of work to listen to. Then I'll see where it goes from that. Part of the reason that I think it didn't work as a book is, you know, they're trying to me to get it as to write as an academic book and I wanna tell the story. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Terry: </b>Right. There's a very interesting story and people involved and it's not always the people who got famous for doing these things. So I, I just think there's, we have this history that's, it hasn't really been written very well yet. So in a sense, I'm just trying to pull it all to, rather than writing it myself, I'm just trying to pull all those pieces together. So there's a repository, we create this canon, we have an idea into these techniques and you know, so I'll be doing, you know, logic projects. Some of 'em I'll just be recording myself. But again, a lot of techniques and then have also how to use these things in, in a more creative way. Hopefully give you some ideas to do things that you hadn't thought of doing before. But it is somebody, you know, somebody who knows how to use logic. They're mixing and they really wanna work on improving their mixes and improving their sound design and to, to look at these effects in more of them detail and find out really what they can do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And when is this gonna start? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Terry: </b>It will probably come out next summer. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. And of course that, that answer requires me to ask the question. In collecting all of the stories that you've pulled together, what's, what's one of the more amazing stories that you ran across that you feel that you could share now? Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Terry: </b>I don't know if it's a story so much, but just I think with echo that really have echo coming from two places, we have it coming from Bill Putnam Universal Audio with the early chess recordings, specifically on little Walters recordings. It starts with Duke and they're doing really interesting use of echo and distortion and they're using that echo in a very formal matter manner where the echo is changing each verse. So the echo and the way they're using the echo is actually reinforcing the formal structure of the song. And it's just brilliant. It's subtle and it changes every verse. And they do this with little Walter for some reason. They make his these records with him and they're unbelievably interesting and refined. Then you have Sam Phillips down in Memphis with the slap <span style="color:red" data-ts="2594.405" data-end_ts="2594.605" title="2594.405" id=c_"2594.405">__back__</span> echo technique, which is a completely haphazard catches one can technique. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Terry: </b>These guys are not wearing headphones, so they don't know where the echo's going. They're not playing in, you know, in the earlier recordings. They're not playing in tempo with the echo. So the echo is not synced with them. So it's a very chaotic swampy echo. And sometimes it sounds like Elvis is trying to actually swim and sing through that echo as opposed to with the Bill Putin thing, where it's just very refined and it's reinforcing the form of the song and it's making everything like crispr and both of those ideas, they're really refined and they're really chaotic, are great and they sound great. And it's just, I think, interesting that two completely different minds and instead of circumstances and uses did this, but we, we kind of love it all. Sometimes we use, they're very refined. Sometimes we go to the more kind of chaotic. So I, I think that's interesting. And then the fact that Sam Phillips was sending his records up to Bill Putnam to be mastered. So put Putnam <span style="color:red" data-ts="2651.445" data-end_ts="2651.565" title="2651.445" id=c_"2651.445">__Ethic__</span> is the unsung hero of rock and roll who has not gotten all the credit he should in my opinion. <laugh>. There you go. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well Terry, I want to thank you so much for taking the time. It's been fantastic catching up on some of this stuff. Getting to know a little bit more about your background. I look forward to being able to take your course, but I also look forward to getting a chance to talk to you again soon. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Terry: </b>I hope so.
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright, man. Have a great, have a great afternoon then. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Terry: </b>Okay. Thank you very much.
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Many thanks to Terry for hanging out and talking about his background and some of the things that he's experienced over the years. And just keep an eye on, this cadenza thing. It looks like it's gonna be pretty great. Also keep an eye on, in case that book ever does come out, 'cause Terry's got an incredible background <span style="color:red" data-ts="2706.025" data-end_ts="2706.245" title="2706.025" id=c_"2706.025">__or__</span> knowledge on this stuff. So really cool stuff. Thank you so much for listening and we will catch you again next week. Bye.
