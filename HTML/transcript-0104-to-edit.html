<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today I have a great pleasure of introducing you to Mark <span style="color:red" data-ts="14.625" data-end_ts="14.845" title="14.625" id=c_"14.625">__igl__</span>. Mark <span style="color:red" data-ts="15.585" data-end_ts="15.805" title="15.585" id=c_"15.585">__Igl__</span> is a person that I've worked with, in terms of interacting with the hardware, that Ableton Live supports, particularly the push one. And, soon he, and I'll be doing some work on the Push two, I'm sure. But I've just found him to be a really interesting guy. He works in this intersection of hardware and software technology and business and everything. In addition to working for Ableton, he also has a website called AZ Labs. That's az labs.com, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark Egloff: </b>Exactly. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. <laugh> and, where he's putting together some max for live, devices that are really pretty interesting and useful for, kinda large system users, as well as people that are trying to interact with some of the new, the new functions of Live 9.5. So with that big, introduction, I introduced you to Mark <span style="color:red" data-ts="73.485" data-end_ts="73.685" title="73.485" id=c_"73.485">__lov__</span>. Mark, how are you today? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>I'm fine, thanks. Thanks for having me on your show. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, thank you so much for being here. I appreciate it. It's, it's always kind of, weird to figure out the time differences between me and the mountains and you and Berlin, but, Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, this one seemed to work out perfectly, so there we go. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>It's just right. Perfect. Indeed. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Why don't we start off by having you explain what it is that you, do 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>You mean right now at Able? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yes, please. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Yeah. It's, right, so I actually, I started, some of you might know <span style="color:red" data-ts="105.105" data-end_ts="105.265" title="105.105" id=c_"105.105">__that__</span> I started in logistics because, I first just wanted to work at Able, like right before I was, creative from business school, also before I always wanted to become an engineer to, create hardware. So I started in logistics, and then soon after I started Ableton, six, seven years ago, also Max <span style="color:red" data-ts="127.505" data-end_ts="127.665" title="127.505" id=c_"127.505">__Four__</span> Life was introduced and also started using it. And my first project was integrating the A PC 40. And so after I did this and I released the A <span style="color:red" data-ts="137.625" data-end_ts="137.905" title="137.625" id=c_"137.625">__PC__</span> step Sequencer, then soon afterwards I got asked to move into the hardware team from April. At the time, we were smaller and we were working on Push one. And then, so I started basically helping <span style="color:red" data-ts="151.675" data-end_ts="152.385" title="151.675" id=c_"151.675">__Jesse Terry__</span>, who is the product owner for Push One, and the new push, helping out Bridge the Gap because he was living in the US and we needed somebody here. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>So now stuff got bigger as, you know, we've <span style="color:red" data-ts="165.065" data-end_ts="165.465" title="165.065" id=c_"165.065">__pushed__</span> to, <span style="color:red" data-ts="165.965" data-end_ts="166.185" title="165.965" id=c_"165.965">__we__</span> not only did like the software design, but also designed the hardware. So there, we decided that I would take over more the project management part of push, so it's not only now the intersection <span style="color:red" data-ts="178.305" data-end_ts="178.585" title="178.305" id=c_"178.305">__within__</span> the software and the <span style="color:red" data-ts="179.645" data-end_ts="179.805" title="179.645" id=c_"179.645">__Harvard__</span>, but also really the <span style="color:red" data-ts="180.765" data-end_ts="180.885" title="180.765" id=c_"180.765">__Harvard__</span> development and the actual <span style="color:red" data-ts="182.725" data-end_ts="182.885" title="182.725" id=c_"182.725">__Harvard__</span> development was, helping with. And now, since we released the Push two project, we don't really need a project manager anymore. So I'm looking <span style="color:red" data-ts="191.645" data-end_ts="191.845" title="191.645" id=c_"191.645">__little__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="191.845" data-end_ts="191.965" title="191.845" id=c_"191.845">__bit__</span> around, but, the next interesting thing is I could do <span style="color:red" data-ts="195.465" data-end_ts="195.685" title="195.465" id=c_"195.465">__it__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="195.685" data-end_ts="195.885" title="195.685" id=c_"195.685">__able__</span>, so probably soon we'll see. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that sounds, that sounds like a pretty interesting path that you talk. Yeah. So you said you started off working at the, working on the integration of the APC 40 once you started working with hardware. I'm, I'm curious, I'm sure other people are curious too. So the APC 40 was followed by the 20, which probably used the same interface, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>A similar one, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Now, have you also been involved with some of the other, hardware integrations, like, the Innovation Launchpad and the new APCs? Or have, or did you expose an API that they were able to then run with? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>No. So in the beginning, we were set up of integrating all the hardware products. The launchpad was already released when <span style="color:red" data-ts="244.805" data-end_ts="244.925" title="244.805" id=c_"244.805">__I__</span> joined <span style="color:red" data-ts="245.185" data-end_ts="245.405" title="245.185" id=c_"245.185">__and__</span> APC 40. But then after <span style="color:red" data-ts="247.365" data-end_ts="247.725" title="247.365" id=c_"247.365">__joined__</span> the hardware team, we also got like all, every kind of hardware control was also part of our team's work. This is now a little bit different. We're more separated. Okay. So PUSH Team is really focusing on making push better. Right. And control services are integrated by another team, smaller one, which was also <span style="color:red" data-ts="265.565" data-end_ts="265.645" title="265.565" id=c_"265.565">__a__</span> big challenge at that time for me to, like, we were planning what we do next, in the next sprint of development, and then suddenly, oh, we have to develop this script now as well. And then like the whole planning was, taken apart. Yeah. And we had to replan, so that's why we split the stuff up. I see. But I think it was, in terms of say, UX design pushes really taught us a lot about like, what, what's good interaction, what is bad? And I think <span style="color:red" data-ts="297.325" data-end_ts="297.485" title="297.325" id=c_"297.325">__this__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="297.485" data-end_ts="297.605" title="297.485" id=c_"297.485">__had__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="297.605" data-end_ts="297.765" title="297.605" id=c_"297.605">__that__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="297.765" data-end_ts="297.885" title="297.765" id=c_"297.765">__was__</span> a big impact on, kind of the input we give our partners when they want to do something with us in terms of integration. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That makes a lot of sense. Yeah. I got a chance just, two days ago to spend some time with <span style="color:red" data-ts="313.585" data-end_ts="313.805" title="313.585" id=c_"313.585">__the__</span> Push <span style="color:red" data-ts="314.345" data-end_ts="314.565" title="314.345" id=c_"314.345">__two__</span>. They had sort of the launch party kind of thing here in Denver. And so I went down. It was, first of all, it was massively crowded <laugh>. People were really excited by what, what was going on. And quite frankly, I thought it was interesting because the Ableton Live is a point release Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, even though it's a significant one, it's still just a point release and, you know, an extension of existing hardware. But I had never seen excitement like that in any of the previous meetups that we had regarding, Ableton Live. So congratulations for being part of something that has, has got people so excited. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Yeah. Thank you very much. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So now I'm curious because you've already kind of given us some hints of a pretty unique background having graduated from business school, but having a desire to work on hardware and manufacturing. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, also clearly being interested in music and music production. I'm curious about where a guy like you comes from <laugh>. Right. Cool. Because, that's a pretty curious mix of interests and, a curious background. And I'm, I am interested in, in where you come from, how how'd you grow up, what have been your interests and what have been your influences? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Yeah. So listen to some of your podcasts <span style="color:red" data-ts="396.685" data-end_ts="396.765" title="396.685" id=c_"396.685">__and__</span> like everybody had this kind of rather musical background. While for me, I think I didn't really have that. I learned a little bit, playing the piano, but besides that, I think the big drive that led me finally to come to where I am right now is like the interest in new technology and trying things out. So I'm half Japanese and like going to Japan always like fed my desire of seeing new stuff. Right. And I forgot for what reason, but at one point of time, I got in touch with music technology, I think is when I start, when I was living in Japan for one year, learning Japanese, but every day commuting to my school, I was, walking by like <span style="color:red" data-ts="445.005" data-end_ts="445.125" title="445.005" id=c_"445.005">__this__</span> YAMA stores and these other stores, and I would spend like hours in there just playing around with all the hardware I have lying around there. And I think, right. This was right after high school. And I think from that point of time, I started getting more and more interested in, in, music hardware and software. Mm-Hmm. And then, so later on I was, I think playing around, I think it started with Fruity Loops. <span style="color:red" data-ts="471.145" data-end_ts="471.365" title="471.145" id=c_"471.145">__No__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="471.365" data-end_ts="471.525" title="471.365" id=c_"471.365">__it__</span> started with Rebirth, fruity Loops. But I always, I was never really the musician I figured out. Then in the end, I always <span style="color:red" data-ts="480.685" data-end_ts="480.925" title="480.685" id=c_"480.685">__tried__</span> to make music, but what really interested me was like the underlying technology. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="485.645" data-end_ts="485.765" title="485.645" id=c_"485.645">__I__</span> was there. I think one of the bigger things where I got really excited, but actually I never used the product was, the, what's called from Melaine, the latest iteration. Yeah, right. It was like, wow, it is really cool. Just realized this, it's always this technology. And I think then I found my thing when I got introduced to Max and Max for life, because <span style="color:red" data-ts="507.895" data-end_ts="508.245" title="507.895" id=c_"507.895">__their__</span> earliest, what I really like to do is making tools for other musicians to, be creative. Yeah. So me, myself, not see myself being a musician actually helps me to create tools for other people and then make them help them being successful, this kind of sharing the success of what they're doing. That was also the reason why I, set up now this website where I focused on the kind of tools to help people more follow their own workflow. Sure. Instead of like, taking what is given. And I think Max Life is just the best tool for <span style="color:red" data-ts="544.525" data-end_ts="544.685" title="544.525" id=c_"544.525">__that__</span>. So I'm not working on like synthesizers and stuff. It's really looking at what, the Live API is offering and what Max is offering, and how can we actually improve this kind of idiosyncratic, workflows each musician has, make this happen. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. So, boy, I already have a bunch of questions, but I'm gonna start off with one. Which is, it's interesting that you talk about, about the influence of being in Japan Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> on your interest in both hardware and software. I spent some time in Japan in 19 94, 19 94, 19 95. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And one of the things that I was really surprised about was the extent to which music and music technology was kind of part of the general culture. Yeah. So you would go to a magazine shop and there would be 20 magazines about, you know, playing MIDI files and doing your own karaoke or, you know, doing music production. There. It, it seemed to be that there were as many, there were as many magazines about music as there were about like hairstyles. Right? Yeah. It was really a part of, it was really a part of culture, and that was not the case at the time in, in the US or in Europe. It just wasn't integrated in that way. I feel like that's starting to happen much more now. When I go to a a magazine shop now they'll have a whole section that's music technology focused and, which, you know, didn't, which has come along rather recently. And I think that actually, the, the interest in Ableton Live is one of the reasons for that. I think people find it easy to approach, and as a result we're seeing music technology become part of popular culture. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Good. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That's what I say. Good. <laugh>, my question is, I think maybe 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Is 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>How do, how do you think that you and, and Ableton by extension have been responsible or have been a part of that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>I think we are really part of music culture. <span style="color:red" data-ts="683.785" data-end_ts="684.005" title="683.785" id=c_"683.785">__No__</span>, I think, I think Ableton just the software itself is not kind of a fixed instrument like it is supposed to be played like this or like this, but it offers kind of a lot of tools like Max <span style="color:red" data-ts="697.565" data-end_ts="697.765" title="697.565" id=c_"697.565">__Stars__</span> for max developers, for musicians to build up a kind of their own workflow, <span style="color:red" data-ts="703.055" data-end_ts="703.405" title="703.055" id=c_"703.055">__right__</span>? Like the session was a big intro, session view was a big introduction to this. And I think just by not having the musicians to learn a specific workflow and how it's supposed, like telling them how to have to <span style="color:red" data-ts="718.765" data-end_ts="718.965" title="718.765" id=c_"718.765">__make__</span>, make them how they have to make music, but rather offering like a wide variety of tools that can pick up and combine in the way they want. I think it just offer a different way of approaching music. And I mean, the session session <span style="color:red" data-ts="733.835" data-end_ts="734.125" title="733.835" id=c_"733.835">__view__</span> is one of the main features that life, I think midlife, become, famous. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>But we have a lot of other small building blocks in life that I think are easy to understand, but still you can build up crazy, workflows just with it. Like the recent, what was it? It's called Push Heroes, <span style="color:red" data-ts="753.865" data-end_ts="754.085" title="753.865" id=c_"753.865">__we__</span> featured where somebody without even Max for life just build a kind of a music game to play with push just by using the clips and the follow actions. <laugh>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="763.865" data-end_ts="764.085" title="763.865" id=c_"763.865">__it__</span> just shows that I think even with simple things with <span style="color:red" data-ts="767.565" data-end_ts="767.765" title="767.565" id=c_"767.565">__still__</span> building blocks, if you allow to combine <span style="color:red" data-ts="770.945" data-end_ts="771.165" title="770.945" id=c_"770.945">__the__</span> things in ways that everybody can like decide by themselves, then it just opens up much more than having more rigid, way of approaching making music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, I think, I think it's interesting though because sometimes tools that are too open-ended. <span style="color:red" data-ts="788.385" data-end_ts="788.605" title="788.385" id=c_"788.385">__Mm__</span>. You know, where it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="789.485" data-end_ts="789.605" title="789.485" id=c_"789.485">__a__</span>, I mean, max sort of suffers from this. Sometimes if something is sort of like, Hey, you can do whatever you want. People have trouble deciding what they want to do. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>That's, that's true. I think that's, yeah. I cannot just make tons of small tools and then hope something will happen. Right. I think, I think I always compare it to, for example, a pencil where you cannot do everything with a pencil, but if you give it to different people, like <span style="color:red" data-ts="818.345" data-end_ts="818.565" title="818.345" id=c_"818.345">__the__</span> child is drawing something to an architect, is building something to, to <span style="color:red" data-ts="822.405" data-end_ts="822.765" title="822.405" id=c_"822.405">__writers__</span>, writing something, this kind of quality of tools. I think that these kind of tools we have a lot in, in life. Sure. And just if you combine them, then there are just unlimited possibilities and it's just bringing out your inner creativeness. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So, you talked about, max for live as being really the thing that kind of caught you on fire Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="847.185" data-end_ts="847.405" title="847.185" id=c_"847.185">__And__</span> kind of, got you excited in working, in, in sort of like extending the tools that were existing. I mean, max is basically a programming language. It's different than many, but it's still at its core, it's still a programming language. Did you have experience before that programming, or was that kind of your first shot at it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>This was basically my first shot at it. Afterwards I <span style="color:red" data-ts="870.285" data-end_ts="870.485" title="870.285" id=c_"870.285">__studied__</span> a little bit, like more the traditional programming things like C <span style="color:red" data-ts="873.605" data-end_ts="873.845" title="873.605" id=c_"873.605">__Sharp__</span> and, but I think it was <span style="color:red" data-ts="875.885" data-end_ts="876.005" title="875.885" id=c_"875.885">__an__</span> advantage not having learned more traditional programming language. At least when I talked to some of our developers here, they had a hard time learning. <span style="color:red" data-ts="885.255" data-end_ts="885.605" title="885.255" id=c_"885.255">__Maxor__</span> stopped because it was just so different from kind of the mental model of how they think Right. Programming works. Right. And I think it's just a much more intuitive way of you just think, okay, I do it like this, then this must exist. And there's an object that does <span style="color:red" data-ts="900.085" data-end_ts="900.285" title="900.085" id=c_"900.085">__that__</span>. And, you put it together. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So what was the process that you went through to learn? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>I think what I realized, what really helped me, although I, it was not the best thing. It was picking a project you want to do. It's not like I want to actually, I still wanna learn something and just go through the tutorials, but more I really wanted to make, I had this idea of the steps always in my head and I want to do that. And Maxwell life seemed to be the right thing. So I just had this project and just learned all the pieces I needed through tutorials. And I, trial and error to learn Max <span style="color:red" data-ts="935.405" data-end_ts="935.605" title="935.405" id=c_"935.405">__for__</span> life. That's, it was not the, it was not the best project to start with <laugh>. It was very complex and everybody who listens to it would try to interact with more. The control surface part at the time was totally not, documented. And there was no official API, this has changed now a little bit with push, but at that time it was just trial and error. Sometimes I could approach some developers to ask how that actually works under the hood so I could understand what I'm doing. But yeah, I think the most important part was to having a project. If I would just have started and say, I want to learn Max, I think this is wouldn't have worked. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That's, that's actually an excellent point. The so often when I talk to people who struggle learning Max, what they talk about is that they were learning Max as if, as if they were learning a, a standard piece of software rather than trying to learn a programming language. Learning programming languages always works best by choosing a project and then working to that project. Now, my question is, you mentioned that you don't feel like you're a musician yourself. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> that, that you really like the idea though of making tools for musicians. Who are the musicians or what are the processes you use that help inform you about what kind of tools would be useful? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1019.145" data-end_ts="1019.365" title="1019.145" id=c_"1019.145">__So__</span> that's, I mean, just by working here at Ableton, I think I get exposed to a lot of no complaints, but <span style="color:red" data-ts="1026.725" data-end_ts="1026.925" title="1026.725" id=c_"1026.725">__wishes__</span> or complaints from users and starting at like the bigger picture of what is missing or not. I think that's one way of understanding it. And sometimes it was just, I think once I helped a Hungarian drummer to build up a huge life set, controlling his whole show, like in a big, theater. Right. And, and this was just a collaboration and understanding him <span style="color:red" data-ts="1055.185" data-end_ts="1055.405" title="1055.185" id=c_"1055.185">__how__</span>, what he wants to do, getting his ideas of how it should be done, and then more discussing why don't try <span style="color:red" data-ts="1061.365" data-end_ts="1061.445" title="1061.365" id=c_"1061.365">__to__</span> do this and this. And in the end, we ended up with, four great patches where he could control like his whole show just with drums. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, interesting. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So I, I took a look at the offerings that you have, . <affirmative> for your AZ lab site. And a lot of those seem to be really focused towards performance. So you have one where you can kind of like search for clips, . <affirmative>, you know, even if you have thousands of them in your, in your set. Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1089.675" data-end_ts="1089.965" title="1089.675" id=c_"1089.675">__Yeah__</span>. Which is, pretty unique. But the one that I thought was coolest was the one that sort of marks, clips as you play them so you can kind of avoid reuse during a show. Did this happen as a result of working with that drummer, or was it, other requests? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>This was mainly talking internally to a lot of ables who also do gigging Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> teaching. This is more like in the direction of teaching. Right. Actually both of these patches. And it seemed just at the time I was also learning <span style="color:red" data-ts="1122.665" data-end_ts="1122.885" title="1122.665" id=c_"1122.665">__Max__</span> ands, like, this is so simple and just do it. And I did it, and then they shared it around. So I decided, why not make it more widely available. Sure. And yeah, it's, I think what really, what I really like about Max for Life, that makes it unique. I mean, I also liked like all the synthesizers <span style="color:red" data-ts="1141.125" data-end_ts="1141.325" title="1141.125" id=c_"1141.125">__you__</span> make, but they somehow compete with all the internal, instruments and VSDs. But what you can only achieve in Max <span style="color:red" data-ts="1149.485" data-end_ts="1149.645" title="1149.485" id=c_"1149.485">__for__</span> life is, or maybe <span style="color:red" data-ts="1150.685" data-end_ts="1150.885" title="1150.685" id=c_"1150.685">__with__</span> control <span style="color:red" data-ts="1151.205" data-end_ts="1151.365" title="1151.205" id=c_"1151.205">__server__</span> scripts, but maybe if Max for life is changing or adding functionality through <span style="color:red" data-ts="1157.045" data-end_ts="1157.245" title="1157.045" id=c_"1157.045">__the__</span> live API this you can achieve with the vst. And I think there's so much more potential still. And I think that's what I wanna try to do with the, with my website, looking at different aspects of, of, using live and where we somehow lack or just don't wanna do, implement a certain functionality and how we can actually achieve this with, max for live. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's, that's actually a really great point because I mean, I've done, for me, you know, because I was involved in, the max for live releases, I did, synthesizers and stuff, but I also did a lot of midi control systems, you know, like the original step sequencer Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, max for live device, which really was kind of put out there to help people understand how to do step sequencers. <laugh>, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b><laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But also different effects. But I always tried to make things that were particular to the live environment. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know, taking advantage of the transport or the, or the location, you know, the current location, stuff like that. I feel like that's really important because it's really hard to compete against like the UI Diva synthesizer. Yeah. That's an amazing synthesizer. And I don't want to necessarily feel like I have to make a different version of that 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But, you know, like what you did with the thing to sort of like, make any controller be able to do the pad slicing Mm-Hmm. That's new to live 9.5, that's a really great extension of live that doesn't compete with anything else that's out there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Exactly. I think there's still so many things. I have so many ideas in my head. So I think the, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1267.685" data-end_ts="1267.885" title="1267.685" id=c_"1267.685">__future__</span> patches I've seen just right now is just the beginning. And I call it labs because I really try, I would like to interact with, the users of my patches to see like how stuff feels maybe trying out concepts. This is something like able <span style="color:red" data-ts="1282.665" data-end_ts="1282.885" title="1282.665" id=c_"1282.665">__to__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1282.885" data-end_ts="1283.045" title="1282.885" id=c_"1282.885">__be__</span>, it size cannot do anymore just because it's its size. We cannot experiment like this. Even stuff we put in like an <span style="color:red" data-ts="1289.845" data-end_ts="1290.005" title="1289.845" id=c_"1289.845">__all__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1290.005" data-end_ts="1290.125" title="1290.005" id=c_"1290.005">__of__</span> our beta is already quite a advanced. While I think having your own site, trying things out, you cannot do much harm. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1298.555" data-end_ts="1298.845" title="1298.555" id=c_"1298.555">__Yeah__</span>. Yeah. Benefit those who really missing certain features or would like to have life behave a little bit different. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. That's that's a great point. I mean, the other thing you can do with something like AZ Lab that Ableton could never do is make something that works great for some people Mm-Hmm. And doesn't work so great for others, or maybe even doesn't, doesn't operate at all for other people because, for Ableton, I mean, I, in interacting with the engineers and stuff, sometimes you get the sense that the weight of having 4 million users, they're, they're very concerned about messing up with something smaller like this. You can say, I'm making a thing for just a few people. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But it's gonna completely solve a problem for those people. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>It's about just focusing really on the core features. Because I think if you would try to please everybody, then we end up with something that pleases nobody because Right. So many different options and everything, those users who are more at the periphery of kind of our focus. Right. Which still use our software because there's not anything better right. Out there. And because it already does the job very well, I think for this, there is, there's so much potential with, for life to add these kind of things you would never put into our software. Right. But actually we can just, implement it <span style="color:red" data-ts="1384.235" data-end_ts="1384.525" title="1384.235" id=c_"1384.235">__Yeah__</span>. With Max for life. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. So with, with, other people that are doing Max for life development Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, what is, what is some of the stuff that you've seen that you find most exciting? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Just yesterday, I even featured on my side, it was, this guy who already hacked the push to display. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>So, basically just sniffed the USB port to see what's coming in and out. And then, he reverse engineered and already put some stuff there. This was, I think something very interesting actually. I find the stuff we do recently, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1420.645" data-end_ts="1420.805" title="1420.645" id=c_"1420.645">__<inaudible>__</span> does with all <span style="color:red" data-ts="1421.485" data-end_ts="1421.645" title="1421.485" id=c_"1421.485">__these__</span> packs. I think <span style="color:red" data-ts="1422.205" data-end_ts="1422.405" title="1422.205" id=c_"1422.205">__this__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1422.445" data-end_ts="1422.565" title="1422.445" id=c_"1422.445">__I__</span> find very interesting. Right. Seems like we got back to, to Traction. I think <span style="color:red" data-ts="1425.765" data-end_ts="1425.885" title="1425.765" id=c_"1425.765">__that__</span> was after the release, there was this big hype, and then in between there was a little bit, but I think right. Recently we put much more, emphasis again on also delivering good content for Max for life and just his written packs. A really cool, I'm a little bit more focused on my stuff, so I haven't done much looking outside. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Let's talk a little bit more about hardware and particularly the hardware interaction with software. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> all that stuff. That to me is sort of like where there's the most excitement in music technology right now. And again, Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, my experience going to this recent launch thing at our local, our local meetup was really surprising. The, the concept, the, the push to excited people in a way that I hadn't really seen. I mean, we have meetups where they're talking about modular systems, which are pretty <span style="color:red" data-ts="1484.385" data-end_ts="1484.605" title="1484.385" id=c_"1484.385">__pop__</span> popular or where we talk about like live streaming and live performance stuff, which are popular, but nothing was as popular as the excitement of getting to see and the touch and play with the push to. What do you think <span style="color:red" data-ts="1499.285" data-end_ts="1499.485" title="1499.285" id=c_"1499.285">__it__</span> it is that makes this, makes the hardware that exciting? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>There's so many different aspects. So if I just, I've been really very much involved in the hardware design itself also in terms of, not design, but the development. Right. And just to say it's, it's really the most beautiful piece of hardware of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1522.325" data-end_ts="1522.485" title="1522.325" id=c_"1522.325">__media__</span> controllers <span style="color:red" data-ts="1523.515" data-end_ts="1523.805" title="1523.515" id=c_"1523.515">__have__</span> right now, but it's really not a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1525.405" data-end_ts="1525.525" title="1525.405" id=c_"1525.405">__media__</span> controller anymore because the whole background, the integration and everything makes it really an instrument. Right. And so I think it's, it's the hardware itself. It's, if you put the push one and push two together, you see a big difference if you play the pads. That's just, awesome. I think all, all the learnings we got out from, push one, they went into the push two development of the pads. So especially me, I was not so happy with the Push one pads to play them. Like with more wrist pressure, you always have to hit the pads, but from the way I play the piano, I'd rather just put my fingers on the pads and then press them down. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>So I think this is now finally possible with Push two, which is not, the case with push one. Sure. So it allows <span style="color:red" data-ts="1572.725" data-end_ts="1572.925" title="1572.725" id=c_"1572.725">__them__</span> more play styles and hope in the future, maybe one point of time we even support further play styles if the firmer, allows for it. But I think the other beautiful thing is just the integration. I mean, if I compare how many developer hours and designer hours we put into push compared to the other hardware, hardware we integrate, I think it's, it's so much more so what you are paying for. It's, it's really nice piece of hardware. But I think the biggest <span style="color:red" data-ts="1604.405" data-end_ts="1604.685" title="1604.405" id=c_"1604.405">__really__</span> just comes from this integration and this time around. We, I think I would not even call it integration anymore because we developed so much things in <span style="color:red" data-ts="1613.845" data-end_ts="1613.965" title="1613.845" id=c_"1613.845">__a__</span> life itself just to make it work perfectly with push, new features and the whole simpler that it's, yeah. It's just make it, I think this notion of instrument is really what we <span style="color:red" data-ts="1627.405" data-end_ts="1627.645" title="1627.405" id=c_"1627.405">__achieve__</span>. And I think this <span style="color:red" data-ts="1628.245" data-end_ts="1628.445" title="1628.245" id=c_"1628.245">__should__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1628.715" data-end_ts="1629.005" title="1628.715" id=c_"1628.715">__just__</span> have with a lot of the other, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1631.815" data-end_ts="1632.165" title="1631.815" id=c_"1631.815">__other__</span> nice, hardware controllers around 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It. Right. Well, I, I have to congratulate you guys on what you did with the pads. I, I have a long history with pads. I was, really focused on using the old MPC style systems. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I, I, you know, came up starting with the MPC 60 and kind of grew up with, with those. And playing that way is really integral to how I imagine myself working. And frankly, with the push one, I was constantly trying to tweak the sensitivity of the pads to get something that I could play without, like my hands getting, getting tired or whatever. And I eventually came to some sort of half-assed agreement with the push one about how I was gonna play. Right. But I got to spend a little time with Push two at this meetup the other night, and I was shocked to me, the, the pads were just as responsive as my favorite controller, which had gotten to be the native instruments machine. It had all of that sensitivity, but because the pads were dropped down to, to roughly the, the height of the face, you could also, like you suggested, alter your playing styles to where you almost have this thing where your fingers are sliding over the tops and the lightest push will activate 'em. That was really, really interesting. And it really, it was almost, eerie playing it that way because it was like, oh my God, there's a whole new style that could develop based on this. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Yeah. It's, I think working with <inaudible>, we got a lot of, of their experience, but we just basically with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1731.225" data-end_ts="1731.445" title="1731.225" id=c_"1731.225">__pet__</span>, like triggering pads, so more from the hip <span style="color:red" data-ts="1735.405" data-end_ts="1735.565" title="1735.405" id=c_"1735.405">__hop__</span> side where <span style="color:red" data-ts="1735.925" data-end_ts="1736.045" title="1735.925" id=c_"1735.925">__we__</span> really would hit the pads hard. Right. And learning from push, because it's also more a melodic instrument. We also saw a lot of users, including me, who wanted to not always hit the pads, but we played them like we were used to, the piano <span style="color:red" data-ts="1751.585" data-end_ts="1751.805" title="1751.585" id=c_"1751.585">__of__</span> other instruments. So from the beginning, we could just build up the algorithm in a way that would also like accommodate this kind of, play style. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, sure. Well, it's interesting that you, you talk about a Kai because actually from my perspective <span style="color:red" data-ts="1764.665" data-end_ts="1764.885" title="1764.665" id=c_"1764.665">__as__</span> a long time a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1765.405" data-end_ts="1765.605" title="1765.405" id=c_"1765.405">__Kai__</span> user Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, they had gotten progressively worse with the sensitivity of their pads, I think because they started worrying about hip hiphop producers banging on the pads, and so they were making them tougher, but as a result they got much less sensitive and it was harder for me to play. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Yeah. It's, it's, it is, it is really difficult to accommodate in one algorithm and in one hardware. The, the hitting and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1792.225" data-end_ts="1792.445" title="1792.225" id=c_"1792.225">__the__</span> pressing right style of play, it's, it's really difficult, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1795.985" data-end_ts="1796.205" title="1795.985" id=c_"1795.985">__was__</span> also hard for us. And I think there's still way, ways to improve there and maybe even accommodate more different types of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1803.125" data-end_ts="1803.325" title="1803.125" id=c_"1803.125">__play__</span> style too. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Now, I got, when I was at the meetup, I was sort of like put out there as a max guy and I was really surprised, first of all, when it came q and a time, an awful lot of people were asking questions about Max for live and its ability to, to be controlled by the push two and to control the push two and stuff like that. We have just began talking about that kind of stuff, but how open is, or how open is the documentation for doing API or other programming calls to the push <span style="color:red" data-ts="1839.905" data-end_ts="1840.125" title="1839.905" id=c_"1839.905">__to__</span>, and do you think we're gonna be able to make it to where a lot of that push functionality is going to exist within Max <span style="color:red" data-ts="1847.765" data-end_ts="1847.965" title="1847.765" id=c_"1847.765">__for__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1847.965" data-end_ts="1848.205" title="1847.965" id=c_"1847.965">__live__</span>? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Yeah, I mean in terms of not talking about the display, but the rest, it is basically the same API we implemented, for push one where you can just grab every kind of button or encoder and use it for your own purposes and then release it again if you didn't use it in your patch. Okay. So that's, it's basically the same thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1873.105" data-end_ts="1873.325" title="1873.105" id=c_"1873.105">__And__</span> yeah, in terms of display, I think it's a bigger challenge now for us to see whether we can somehow make it work in that sense. It's kind of a regression to push one because push one was just much more simpler. So it's easy to write something with CSX into the, into display, into the character display Display. Yeah. Yeah. Right. But now we have, I mean everybody was just think, hey, kind of feed a cheetah matrix into it and we have seen now this heck on this one guy. Right. I think it's not impossible, and of course it's always harder for us to do something more proper and I think integrating a max for life instead of just an external max thing is also a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1910.965" data-end_ts="1911.045" title="1910.965" id=c_"1910.965">__little__</span> more difficult. But I think at one point of time, I really hope also for myself that we, we support it fully like we do <span style="color:red" data-ts="1919.145" data-end_ts="1919.365" title="1919.145" id=c_"1919.145">__one__</span>. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1919.445" data-end_ts="1919.485" title="1919.445" id=c_"1919.445">__I__</span>, I agree. Well, I mean, if nothing else, being able to take advantage of like jitter matrices to do great display interfaces for what's going on <span style="color:red" data-ts="1930.685" data-end_ts="1930.805" title="1930.685" id=c_"1930.685">__in__</span> Live Patch, I think that would just blow people's minds to see that kind of stuff on their hardware. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Yeah. I mean, even if you just look at now interfacing with Mac directly with push, not using live, I think now if you could, from there, it's not so difficult now to access display. You could imagine somebody making kind of a standalone, synthesizer sequencer that would also use the display. So push just becomes a great hardware to integrate with, with like your own things. Sure. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Absolutely. Alright, so, I wanna talk a little bit about what it's like. So I haven't talked to Upper Berlin guy in a while. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, and one of the things I would say is for people here in the US and, and people actually all over the world, there's, there's gotten to be a mystique about Berlin. I mean, a lot of artists move there because of the excitement that's going on there. There seems to be something happening in Berlin at all times. First of all, why do you think Berlin, why do you think Berlin got to be this sort of like art technology center of the world and, and kind of a hip center as well? Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b><affirmative>. Good question. I mean, I grew up in Switzerland, you might hear, hear that, I lived in bigger cities like Japan or Shanghai or Seoul, and I basically just came here for the job for Ableton. I didn't actually know that. As I said, I'm not a musician, so I was not so much, I didn't know that this kind of scene existed. And, like the Germans I knew before were the ones from vacation, from Myorca and from, my business school. And I didn't have so such a good impression about, I had like a wrong picture of Germany. And then I, I arrived at Berlin, it was like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2046.085" data-end_ts="2046.285" title="2046.085" id=c_"2046.085">__will__</span> I survive here or not? But then it immediately blew me. It was just, so, I think it's different from the rest of Germany, Berlin, but I immediately knew that I would wanna live here. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Right. So at the time, I was already married, freshly married, and, I was still living in China, this's Chinese. And I said, I wanna live here. And then she joined me too and lived here for some time. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="2068.845" data-end_ts="2068.965" title="2068.845" id=c_"2068.845">__she__</span> also said, it's, it's just perfect. And it's difficult to say, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2073.885" data-end_ts="2074.165" title="2073.885" id=c_"2073.885">__well__</span>, what it is, I mean, for me personally, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2078.105" data-end_ts="2078.325" title="2078.105" id=c_"2078.105">__eh__</span>, it's just, everything's just right. You know, it's not like you optimize on certain aspects and it's like the living quality <span style="color:red" data-ts="2090.145" data-end_ts="2090.365" title="2090.145" id=c_"2090.145">__in__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2090.365" data-end_ts="2090.525" title="2090.365" id=c_"2090.365">__general__</span> work is great. I think all the comp, most companies here, especially Ableton, just allow us to have a very good, worklife balance. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, but also I think the colleagues here makes just very nice <span style="color:red" data-ts="2103.865" data-end_ts="2104.085" title="2103.865" id=c_"2103.865">__to__</span>, to work here. And yeah, I think just in general, the the cultural offering you have, not only in music, but whatever else, just makes it nice to live here. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Yeah. You don't have, I think what, what I didn't like when I lived, in Asia, in Shanghai, in Japan, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2123.345" data-end_ts="2123.565" title="2123.345" id=c_"2123.345">__in__</span> Korea, was <span style="color:red" data-ts="2124.085" data-end_ts="2124.325" title="2124.085" id=c_"2124.085">__just__</span> very much focus on, consumption. Consumption, right? So whatever you do, you have to somehow consume what we do in the evening. Let's go to the mall or let's go there. I think you could not have fun without, not consuming. While I think they've just arrived in summer here in Berlin <span style="color:red" data-ts="2142.355" data-end_ts="2142.575" title="2142.355" id=c_"2142.355">__10__</span> years ago, and you didn't have to spend any money. You just can't go somewhere in the park. And there's so much to see, so many performances. People just wanna show stuff they do not because of the money or to sell something, just because they want show. So you have, I think, not kind of, you have some kind of authenticity you don't get if everything is just powered by money in the background. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I think that's a great, that's a great point. And you know what's funny for me is for about the first 10 years of my experience with Germany, it was always with Frankfurt, which was going to Frankfurt Music, Mesa and Frankfurt, the city sort of like, is what I thought Germany was like <laugh>. Right? And then the first time I was invited by Ableton to come up to Berlin, I was shocked because it was as unlike Frankfurt as I could possibly have imagined. Yeah. You know, it was where Frankfurt is about business and banking and and power and Berlin seemed like kind of a big commune or something, I don't know. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, it was like, you'd walk down the street and somebody will <span style="color:red" data-ts="2214.055" data-end_ts="2214.215" title="2214.055" id=c_"2214.055">__have__</span> just opened up a falafel shop and you get something that's amazing and then you'd walk down the street a little further and there would be musicians doing their things. There was clubs running stuff all the time. It just seemed like, such a more open and, and to me very much like the, almost the exact opposite of what Frankfurt was. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Hmm. I, I mean, what I just told you, I always talk to people here and I mean, the Germans themselves say Berlin is quite different from just the rest of Germany. So I think everybody <span style="color:red" data-ts="2247.015" data-end_ts="2247.255" title="2247.015" id=c_"2247.015">__would__</span> live in Dusseldorf for Frankfurt or wherever else Munich. I think it's just very different from Berlin, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Yeah, certainly. Well, and it's, and it seems like if you kind of track the music coming out <span style="color:red" data-ts="2258.335" data-end_ts="2258.455" title="2258.335" id=c_"2258.335">__of__</span> different places Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> even, even within Germany, the music coming out of Berlin is very different from Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, what's coming out of, some of the other cities. Mm-Hmm. So that's really interesting. Well, mark, we're coming to the end of our time here. I really appreciate you taking time outta your schedule to, to talk to me. That's fine. I'm, I'm kind of curious now you're sort of like on the inside of the music and particularly the music hardware technology scene. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, what do you think represents the future for music technology and particularly music hardware? 'cause music hardware's going through sort of like a renaissance right now. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, what do you, where do you think it's going? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Hmm, good question. I think what we see right now is kind of a proliferation of tons of hardware. I think everybody chomping now onto the hardware and somehow with their own concept of how something is supposed to work, some of them make it not so good. I think we show very good examples of how interaction with hardware can work. But I think one interesting, direction I hope the stuff will evolve to is if the users of the hardware actually can decide by themselves much more easily how, like, how stuff works, how actually they want to interact with hardware. It's like you get a push right now. It's, I think we saw, we spent so many hours into making great ux, but for certain ways of working, it doesn't work perfectly. Yeah. So you have to adapt your workflow to this, but what if you can build up kind of your own controller just the way you want it? And I think like, jumping a little more <span style="color:red" data-ts="2363.485" data-end_ts="2363.645" title="2363.485" id=c_"2363.485">__onto__</span> this building maker thing where everybody, I think creating your heart and controller or creating like your setup is also part of the creative process. I'm not sure if you can follow me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>No, absolutely. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>I think I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2377.725" data-end_ts="2377.845" title="2377.725" id=c_"2377.725">__see__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You're, so it's it you're almost suggesting that, that you see the future that building your own instrument because becomes part of being a musician. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Yeah, exactly. I mean, it is much, it is actually very hard if you use a existing instrument, like if, for example, classical music, you have the piano, there's no way you can reinvent the piano. So you have to live with that. You also have to live actually if the music that has already been composed to it. So if you <span style="color:red" data-ts="2405.325" data-end_ts="2405.525" title="2405.325" id=c_"2405.325">__might__</span> like more <span style="color:red" data-ts="2405.845" data-end_ts="2405.965" title="2405.845" id=c_"2405.845">__a__</span> classically trained pianist, the only thing you can do to somehow, let's say succeed is to become the best performing thing, but based on already given instrument and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2418.085" data-end_ts="2418.245" title="2418.085" id=c_"2418.085">__then__</span> already given music. While I think, more the contemporary musicians, and I think a lot of able musicians, the creative process consists of not only performing or only composing, but actually building the things that somehow is their secret sauce to the uniqueness of what they produce. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That's, you know, I've never thought of it that way, but you're right. In classical music, the way that you become successful is by being the most technically proficient person on <span style="color:red" data-ts="2448.645" data-end_ts="2448.765" title="2448.645" id=c_"2448.645">__an__</span> instrument. And where in, in a lot of electronic music, it's almost like your ability to be an inventor. Exactly. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2456.955" data-end_ts="2457.445" title="2456.955" id=c_"2456.955">__Because__</span> it's very important part of being successful. That's, that's, I think 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>It's really cool. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2461.035" data-end_ts="2461.325" title="2461.035" id=c_"2461.035">__Yeah__</span>. I think it's, it's not the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2463.165" data-end_ts="2463.365" title="2463.165" id=c_"2463.165">__survival__</span> of the fittest, but it's finding your niche. Right. Right. That lets you live there. And I think, I think a lot of the internet just helped to survive in this niche. 'cause before you might have had a very interesting kind of music workflow thing that would have interest a lot of people, but you couldn't connect to them because they could not find you. And nowadays that's just possible. And I think if you see, if you see stuff featured on our side, but also on opia or everywhere else, just, pay attention to how much is it actually just the music you're interested in versus actually the way they make music, the setup. Right. I think most of the time you actually want to, if you just would listen to the music they make, it would just be okay. But if you see how they actually make this music, this whole thing becomes very interesting. And so I'm looking into a future where yeah, everybody can build their own secret sauce <span style="color:red" data-ts="2521.105" data-end_ts="2521.325" title="2521.105" id=c_"2521.105">__and__</span> something that's interesting and not has to say, okay, I have to use this controller now this fits roughly what I want to do, but this doesn't work. And then the next controller comes out that maybe fits a little bit better, so they have to throw it away and buy the next one. Right. But more just make, make your own thing. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That sounds, that sounds pretty like a pretty exciting future to me. Yeah. Mark, I want to thank you so much for, taking time outta your schedule. You've really kind of like opened my mind to some ideas and it, and it's funny, while you don't couch yourself as a musician per se Mm-Hmm. It seems like you have a very artistic or musicianly kind of mind that you're putting to this. And so I think I and everybody that uses your creations is very thankful for that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2566.555" data-end_ts="2566.845" title="2566.555" id=c_"2566.555">__Yeah__</span>. I think it's, I've just recently started thinking about these kind of things because I think what the other Max, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2574.275" data-end_ts="2574.565" title="2574.275" id=c_"2574.275">__what__</span> the kind of max for life developer or <span style="color:red" data-ts="2575.925" data-end_ts="2576.045" title="2575.925" id=c_"2575.925">__the__</span> max developer, any kind of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2577.485" data-end_ts="2577.645" title="2577.485" id=c_"2577.485">__this__</span> kind of developers do, their creation is almost similar to the creations of a musician for their audience. Right. It's somehow they wanna achieve some kind of help their audience achieve something else. Right. Right. So I think in that sense, yeah, I think we would also, we should also see, this kind of programmers also as musicians. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2600.435" data-end_ts="2600.725" title="2600.435" id=c_"2600.435">__Yeah__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I hear you. Yeah. Well, thank you so much and have a great day. I hope we'll talk again soon. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Yeah, let's keep in touch. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2609.185" data-end_ts="2609.405" title="2609.185" id=c_"2609.185">__All__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2609.405" data-end_ts="2609.445" title="2609.405" id=c_"2609.405">__right__</span>. Have 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>A nice day. Sounds good. All goodbye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>See you. Bye darling. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Many thanks to Mark for spending a little time talking about all kinds of stuff. Hardware, software, his work with Max <span style="color:red" data-ts="2628.525" data-end_ts="2628.765" title="2628.525" id=c_"2628.525">__four__</span> live, his vision for the future. Really interesting stuff. I also want to take this opportunity to thank you, the listeners for tuning in every week and for talking about it with other people getting great listenership. And, it really is, a lot of fun to do this for y'all. So thanks for that, and I'll be talking to you next week. Bye.
