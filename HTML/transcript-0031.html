      <b>Darwin:</b> Last week we did something a little bit different by having the conversation be between me and two other people. This one, we go even weirder. I decided to take you out on the road with me. Literally. I had been working with Mike Metley on some research for some articles for <a href="https://recordingmag.com">RECORDING Magazine</a>, where he's the editor, and it just got to be too much. We just had to get out of the house. We had to go get some food. And I decided that I wanted to interview him for the podcast. So we took my, what I thought at the time to be, trusty TASCAM DR-07MKII, stuck it in the cup holder of the truck and, on a rainy evening in May in the Colorado Mountains, we kicked off this interview.
    </p>

    <p>Now we're all over the map here, and we had some technical issues, which you'll hear me squawk about. And so, I actually had to break off the recording a couple of times. What you'll hear is this sound [TECHNICAL PROBLEMS SOUND] and that'll mean that we had some break in time, when either we fixed technical problems, or got some Indian food, or moved from the truck to the house, or whatever.</p>
    <p>It's also the longest interview that I've ever done, but it's because Mike has a lot of knowledge that he's interested in sharing. But also because he has a tendency to get distracted a bit, too. Which is fun.</p>
    <p>And so we kind of go for a wheeling ride through most of the early Internet interactions for electronic musicians. And also to have a discussion about how social media either does or does not improve your life. I think Mike would suggest that the answer is… does not.</p>
    <p>But, nevertheless, I hope you enjoy this podcast. It's a long one clocking in at just under an hour and twenty-five minutes, but it's also pretty interesting. And again, I apologize for the quality of the sound. My little recorder did not do me proud. Although half of it was recorded in my basement, so, or in my studio, [whispers] I didn't call it a basement. So the quality's a little bit better there, but I hope you enjoy it and I will talk to you at the end of the podcast. 
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>This week, I'm going to be interviewing my friend Mike Metlay. Mike is… he's got one hell of a background. I actually met him…
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike Metlay: </b>…Tallahassee, Florida in 1995.
    <p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. About to have his first child.
    </p>


    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>And second album. I'm not sure which was making me more nervous. (Laughter).
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>And my most strong memories from that visit are two. One that he drives like an insane man. And secondly, we ate at a Jamaican food place and he chided me for having pennies in the tip. I was just like throwing change on the table. And so, I got the discipline I saw desperately needed…
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>…And I got to show off what a completely micromanaging jerk I was. 
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, there you go, so. But Mike has got a really interesting background. Interesting. There's the word again. Mike's got a really great background to kind of plum because he's been around for a long time. Especially because he was sort of on the bleeding edge of the electronic music community and its instantiation in the Internet. Now, when I interviewed Nick Rothwell, we talked a little bit about it and kind of some of the fun history of like being able to tell exactly which computer a person was on because of the routing records on the email that you sent or whatever. But I wanted to talk to Mike a little more thoroughly about the whole eMusic internet world, because he had some lists that he maintained. You did both <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050515075340/ibiblio.org/emusic-l/welcome.html">EMUSIC-L</a> and 
    SYNTH-L, right? 
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>Yeah. They were two mailing lists that were being sponsored on the list server at AUVM, which was the big VAX mainframe cluster at the American University in Washington, DC. 
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>Okay. All right. I always wondered how American was involved and that makes more sense.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>Yeah, they actually had a bunch of lists on all manner of topics, but the ones that were specifically of interest to us of course were EMUSIC-L, which was an academic list talking about the theory practice and more high-end idea space of electronic music, and SYNTH-L got spun off years later as a place for people to basically geek out about gear.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>Right. Which the Internet seems particularly wired to deal with, don't you think? 
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>Well (laughs), the world has always had people who are fascinated by technology, and the Internet just lets them find each other a little quicker. 
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>Right. So, before EMUSIC-L and then subsequently SYNTH-L, was there a community on the Internet that found itself somehow? Or was that really the launch point?
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>Well, EMUSIC-L was important for a couple of reasons. Let me start off by telling you a little story that you might find amusing. Which was, when I first changed careers and started working at RECORDING Magazine, among the people that I got to know in the office was a new production manager, who was a young lady, a Boulder native, very smart, competent person, but hadn't really had a whole lot of tech experience. And one day I was chatting with her about this and that and she got onto the politics of indigenous nations having their culture and their rituals wiped out by tides of external people with a lot of money coming in and basically paving their homes. And she was saying how she would never, ever want to be a member of a community that did that to someone. And I said, "How do you get on the Internet?" And she said, "America Online, why?" (Laughter.) And she didn't know why I was laughing. Because, of course, in the days before AOL, and before the web, before these communities existed, there were these mailing lists that were founded and run in the infant Internet. And these were big clusters of mainframe computers that were located generally at universities or government offices and nets that were not really connected to one another in what we would nowadays call the Internet.</p>
    <p>You had BITNET, which was a way of connecting universities and academic locations. You had MILNET, which was running between military installations. You had GOVNET, which was fairly small, but that was, you know, government offices.
    </p>

    <p>[TECHNICAL PROBLEMS SOUND]</p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>In case you haven't noticed, first of all, we're doing this interview while we're driving. Second of all, we had some technical problems because, apparently, an iPhone 5 near a TASCAM DS-07… is that what it is?</p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin and Mike together:</b>DR-07
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>…Mark II, apparently that's a lethal combination, so, we're done with that. Cell phone off. So, anyway, you were talking about BITNET and GOVNET…
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>Right, and ARPANET, of course, being the original original,  that some people still had ARPANET addresses. So, if you cast your mind back to the early eighties, this is a situation before we had, what we call now, the Internet.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>Right.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>Because these nets weren't connected to one another except via very specific machines called gateways. So, if you wanted to talk to somebody, or send somebody in the email, what you had to do was you would, well, way early on you'd have bang paths where you would actually trace a route and you would have to know exactly which computer could talk to which computer, and you would jump from stone to stone across the pond to get to somebody. But then eventually they had gateways where if you wanted to get to MILNET you had to know that there was a particular gateway address, and you would aim your email at that gateway, and then it would know how to parse out the email address.
    </p>
    <p>
    So, it was a very different kind of a culture. And the reason I bring all this up is not just because of the fact that it was difficult for people to talk to one another and to find central locations for this kind of information, which we take for granted these days. What was more important was that there was a real self-selection process in who was on the Internet in the first place. The average punter who was interested in getting online generally belonged to a bulletin board service. And you had these self-contained online communities. So, you had The WELL in the Bay Area and you had Compuserve, GEnie…
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>What was the one that was, it was almost more like a bulletin board than anything, that was done by some of the electronic music magazines at the time?
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>Oh, that was The WELL, the Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link, wasn't it?
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>No, no, no, there was another one.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>Er… (Laughs)
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>No, well, we'll figure it out and come back to it. But it was like, I remember that Craig Anderton was on it and you could actually communicate with people from MOTU or some of these other places, but it was a dial-up thing, you know.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>And you would leave messages and hear back. Because, of course, back then if you got 5,600 baud you were living large. 
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>Right, well, and also you paid by the minute, so there was no way you could sit on it all day and have anything close to a real time exchange, it just wasn't happening. You'd leave a message and you'd come back tomorrow and check to see if anyone…
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>…had answered. Exactly. And the whole concept of email was still being developed at the time.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>Right.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>So, what was interesting was that there was a particular network that came along in the mid '80s called Usenet. And Usenet was a "we're better than you are because our operating system is smarter than yours so nyer nyer nyer" network, which basically connected Unix mainframes around the world. It was a common framework. And, by the way, for all of you people out there who are older than I am and who lived through this, if I'm getting stuff wrong…
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>Sorry!
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>…send any complaints to /dev/null. (Laughter.)
    </p>
    <p>The point is that Usenet had the ability to network information and to have shared databases of… basically, they were like email posts, but they were the nascent newsgroups.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>Right.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>And so, what you had on the Usenet networks, anybody with a Unix machine or a machine that was capable of attaching via a gateway to a Unix machine, had the ability to get to these networks and they would have subject matter, and then you would have a dot and then a subtopic and then a sub-subtopic.
    </p>
    <p>So you would have, for instance, rec were the recreational newsgroups. And so you would have rec.music, which was a general music discussion newsgroup. But then, under that, you would have rec.music.synth, which was the group for electronic musicians. And then you would have rec.music.makers, which was the one for people who used acoustic and electric instruments. And then somebody came along and tried to legislate the hierarchy of these things, so they said that rec.music.synth shouldn't be its own group, and it became rec.music.makers.synth.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>OK.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>And that confused everybody because then nobody was gonna shut down rec.music.synth and so they ended up splitting the audience. 
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>Right. I totally forgot about Usenet. I don't know how, because I spent hours of my employer's time sitting there gawking at Usenet. 
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>Oh yeah, well, you know, I mean, and there were some really famous groups. I mean, some of the very early comp groups, where people would share information about operating systems. And then, of course, you know, human civilization being what it is, the second group created was alt.sex, and everything that came in there. And then you would have the alt.fan groups, which were fans of music or art or movies or literature, whatever, would hang out. It was an enormous hierarchy. And, by today's standards, the entire output of that network would probably fit on somebody's hard drive without any trouble at all. But, back then, it was gobs of data flying around, and you'd log in and you'd connect to the Usenet newsgroups and there would be a plethora of messages in the groups that you were subscribed to that you would then read through and comment on, and it was just presented as this one long running stream of topics and answers and things like that.
    </p>

    <p>I mean, probably the closest thing in today's world to something like that would be a Facebook timeline or a Twitter timeline, because today's forums are much better organized. There was no such thing as threading for a long time. Evventually threading got added, but then what you had was, you had people whose computers supported threading and people whose computers didn't, and then folks would complain if you wandered off topic. It was a mess. But, in amongst all of that, you had a very specific community of people with specific interests who were finding one another. And because this wasn't something that anybody could get onto, it was something where you had to have a certain degree of technical savvy, you had to have a certain degree of knowledge and you had to have connections. And I don't mean that in a literal sense, I mean that in a metaphorical sense. If you weren't at a university, or at a military base, or at a national laboratory or something of that level, you didn't have access to a mainframe computer. Nobody had a VAX in their basement. And so, it was either the bulletin board systems, which were available to anyone and everyone, but which tended to be limited to these sort of technology forward geeks who liked having a Commodore 64 on their desk, you know, the ancestors of modern chip tunes, or you're talking about an academic or military computer science community. And that's a pretty intense filter. If you start with those people the level of discourse is gonna be pretty high. You're not gonna have your average fourteen-year-old logging on and wondering where to pick up chicks, or if anybody has a place to download…
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin:</b> …the latest Skrillex album… 
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>…or, you know, we're talking well, at the time…
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>…at the time, the latest Yes (??) album. (Laughter.)
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>Well, no, actually. But, remember, people didn't download music. The bandwidth was too slow and nobody stored music on hard discs anyway. No, no, no, back then it was downloading line printer porn. (Laughter.) So you could print out pictures of naked women on a teletype. (Laughter.) I mean, you know, we're talking serious technology here.
    <p>

    <p>[TECHNICAL PROBLEMS SOUND]</p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>It was a very fertile ground for discussions of music and creativity and technology to take root, and for people to make an effort to connect with one another and sort of get in each other's heads. And a lot of the etiquette, and a lot of the behavior that we take for granted nowadays as part of how the Internet works was still being developed. So, it was a fascinating time because we were not only learning what we wanted to talk to one another about, but we were also creating the language. 
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, now, to what extent do you think that, sort of, that self-selection process also led to, sort of, the heavy gear, geek level part of it? And also the fact that you were either working for somebody with these connections, or you were wealthy enough to have access to them?
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>Well, every technology starts out in the hands of people who are wealthy enough to afford it. And the beautiful thing about the information age versus the space age, and before that, the age of transportation, and before that the age of industry, was that the time from "it's brand new and only a few people have it" to "it's everywhere" was greatly compressed. You didn't have a whole generation where only the rich and famous had something. By the time we got old enough to have kids it was everywhere. And, so, there was an initial self-selection process which produced a kind of a ferment for the sort of creativity that went on. But, as fondly as we look back and remember it, we have to remember that it was only a few years. We're talking 1983, 1984, really until '95, which is when AOL and the web really exploded, and then everybody got involved. Which is, on the one hand, a really good thing, and on the other hand, that was what gave rise to my joke when I was talking to this woman and she was talking about the indigenous culture being wiped out. Because, we had had this very tight community of well-educated, intelligent people who did things a certain way. And, all of a sudden, the digital doors got battered down and anyone with a $100 computer and a modem could get online and express their opinion. And that is both a good and a bad thing. You know, democracy is wonderful, but participatory democracy, like they had in ancient Greece, only works if you're talking about a number of people the size of your average Greek city. But, when you start talking about a country or the planet…
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>…the planet…
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>(Laughter.) You know, and we're seeing it nowadays with Twitter and Facebook and Instagram and Reddit. Everyone's talking at once. And the one thing about the mailing lists and Usenet is that, especially the mailing lists for AUVM, they had community standards, because they were part of a university that had a charter that had to answer to a board of trustees. And they were moderated. And if somebody got off topic, or said something that didn't fit with what people were trying to learn, they went away because… 
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>…they were sent packing, yeah…
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>…you made them go away. And, in fact, the great destruction of the early hierarchy came when someone came along who had a very deliberate agenda to push the envelope of what they were and were not allowed to say, and who brought in the whole question of freedom of speech and freedom of expression versus oppressive moderation of discourse on these forums. And this one person single-handedly destroyed some of the early forums. And you know who I'm talking about. 
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>Yes, I do. Our friend, antiorp / NN.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>Oh, yes. And, to this day, we don't know who he or she is, or whether it was more than one person, or where they lived. They were the first of the great Internet creative community cyber criminals. antiorp did an album. It's actually quite good. I actually have a copy. Although, whenever I listen to it…
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>Good as, it's interesting. I would say very interesting.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>It is very interesting. And what was it that Nick Rothwell said about it? He said, "I wanted to turn it off, but by track fifty-seven I couldn't move."
    <p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>(Laughs.)
    </b>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>It was noise. It was very early sample chopping, and really random, really heavy duty stuff. But, over and above that, there were also things like websites with code that was designed to open windows outside your browser. And, you know, you would crash computers. I mean, antiorp really made an effort and basically said I am expressing myself, I am creating art, I'm being creative and these people are stifling me. And, in fact, there was an entire newsgroup created specifically… (laughs). We didn't wanna admit it to ourselves. It was a collection of list owners of other mailing lists and newsgroups that dealt with creative technology to talk about issues of governance and freedom of information. And what none of us wanted to admit was that it was antiorp support group. Because, James McCartney was on it…</p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>…The Max list at McGill…
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>…yeah, exactly. Tom Erbe was on it. I was on it. Joe McMahon was on it because he was helping out with EMUSIC-L at the time. And, basically, we all just got on there to bitch about antiorp and to wonder what to do, and to give each other support when, you know… Because there's always gonna be people coming out of the woodwork. You know, woodwork squeaks out come the freaks. antiorp inspired a lot of people to ask these important relevant questions. But what it really came down to at some point was the discussion of the questions became everything and people stopped talking about music.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That's right. 
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>And, it was sort of, it was sad. 
    </p>

    <p>[TECHNICAL PROBLEMS SOUND IS PLAYED]</p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>So, umm… 
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>(Laughing.) This is going to be the weirdest transcript of any of these podcasts. 
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>So we had a chance to kind of talk about how the Usenet groups kind of did what they did and it actually led to some, you know, if you're being dis- or non-generous you would say antisocial behavior, but it was, in a way, artistic behavior, too. Or an attempt, anyway.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>Well, yes, this is a creative group of people who were learning a new way to talk to one another. And for folks who are technology forward, as electronic creators often are, and for folks who were looking for new ways to press technology into use, as electronic creators often are, it was a very exciting time. It was a great, great way to not work (laughter) when you were on the job. And, you know, if the folks at the Oak Ridge National Lab (??) are listening to this you can suck me, because I figured out a way to use your gateway to get to a SPARCstation at the University of Pittsburgh where you couldn't censor my emails anymore. So… ha! (Laughter)
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>Well, speaking of email, though, I wanna talk about the development of email lists after Usenet, because to me that was the first… 
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>Well, they were in parallel.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>Well, they were in parallel but I felt like, for me at least, mailing lists really quickly surpassed the Usenet because the conversations could be almost real time. I'd say something and there were enough people sitting at their machines so that I would get an instantaneous or almost instantaneous response.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>Uh-huh.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>And also, the other thing that happened was, that developed the kind of community where buying and selling gear seemed to be able to happen. It didn't seem to work in a Usenet environment. 
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>Well, that's an interesting thing. I'm not sure how true that is. You would occasionally get gear for sale stuff, but you would, because of the way it worked, there was no private conversation in Usenet. And that may actually be the key. A mailing list, especially in the old days, when you had lists that didn't hide addresses, a mailing list exposed you as a person sitting at a computer to the world. You were who you were. You could log onto a Usenet newsgroup from anywhere and maybe people could figure out how to get back to you, maybe they couldn't. One of the things that people used to like to do was spoofing email addresses.
    </p>

    <p>And there was that sense of anonymity. The other thing that you had back in those days was you had these great intellectual freedom fighters of the nineties, where there was a fellow, I don't remember what the name of the server was, but there was a fellow in Finland who basically ran a server. All it did was it took in posts to Usenet newsgroups and it stripped out your personal data and put in an anonymous tag. So you could have perfect anonymity. You could do anything, say anything on the Internet without any fear of repercussions from your government because no one knew who you were, even the guy who owned the server, the encryption algorithm was such that he himself didn't know who anybody was. And what ended up happening was the Finnish government ended up forcing him to take it down, and, you know, we've never had privacy since. But, the fact is on an email list you were who you were and it was very easy to take a conversation off a mailing list and go to private mail, if that was necessary. And, yes, one of the things that that made very handy to do was buy and sell gear. That was really the golden age for electronic musicians who were trying to get their hands on gear that nobody wanted anymore, simply because it was easy to find people who had it, or who knew people who had it, and there wasn't yet this pervasive understanding of what things were worth. So there were still deals to be had if you were careful. And, you know, just the other day I went to a pawn shop and they had an absolutely gorgeous, mint miniKORG. They wanted $650 for it, because they knew they could get $650 for it. And when you looked a little closer, there was a little sticker on the price tag that said, "as featured on Craigslist". Well, hooray for us. Twenty years ago, if you found a great deal on a keyboard that nobody wanted anymore, it was a way to build up a studio and to get yourself a set, a palette of tone colors that you could work with without breaking your back. And we were helped along by the fact, of course, that analog was not cool anymore and that only digital was cool and that people were throwing away analog gear for practically nothing. This was long before the resurgence of the vintage movement. And I regularly got laughed at on EMUSIC-L because I had a bunch of analog gear that I refused to sell. And, you know, it's very funny nowadays, I get looked at as sort of one of these great stalwarts who kept the flame and, frankly, these days almost all the stuff I do is digital. So, you know, there you are.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>. Well, it was interesting though, because you say that people were really into that digital was cool, analog was uncool. But there started to be, sort of, this groundswell that eventually became <a href="http://machines.hyperreal.org/Analogue-Heaven/">the mailing list Analogue Heaven</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>Yes. 
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>And the one thing I remember, again, there are so many… 
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>We should point out, though, that Digital Hell started at the same time (laughter) and, at the beginning, Digital Hell had just as many members as Analogue Heaven did (laughter). So, you know, it was even at the start. But, you're right. Analogue Heaven was an important piece of evolution.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>Well, for me, myself, and again I have so many personal memories of this stuff. And one of the things that, sort of like, the analog and vintage movement. And, you know, we call it vintage now. Back then it wasn't vintage, it was just old gear.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>Yeah. It was junk. 
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>It was junk. But what I remember was that I could buy a piece of junk from someone for $200, which was a high price for one of the junk pieces, right.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>Oh, yeah. 
    </p>


    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>Let's say that I'm getting a, oh, I don't know, I get a Pro One for $150 or something like that. And I would have so much fun with it. But I would read the magazines, like Keyboard and EM (Electronic Musician) at the time, and it's like, oh, you know, you have to get the brand new whizzy thing of the year.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>Pick a year. I can tell you what the flavor of the year was.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, right. Let's call it '94.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>'94, the Roland D Series was going away. The U Series were morphing into the XP workstations.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>Oh, that's right. Yes. Yeah, that whole JV-1080, and all that kind of stuff.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>And the JD-800 was around in the early nineties. And the JD-800 was the supreme irony. It was a digital sample playing synth that had all the controls of an analog synth. 
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>I love that machine.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>Oh, it's a great, great keyboard. And at the same time then you also had 16-bit samplers were everywhere. And you started seeing digital audio on computers. Pro Tools was just becoming viable.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>But for me, I would get this cheap Pro One, and I would have so much more fun with it than what the full page ad for the U-220 told me I was gonna have.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>Yep. Very true.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>And it started, sort of like, a very kind of an almost anti-commercial thing that I went through. Which was like, "These ads, they're lying to me!" And I mean, now that's sort of like a common trope, right? But at the time, magazines were important at the time because that was the only way to get information about stuff, right?
    </p>


    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>Except the mailing lists.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>Except the mailing lists. And then, all of a sudden, the mailing lists became more trustworthy to me than the magazines.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>Because you were hearing from like-minded people who didn't have an economic stake in what you decided.
    <p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>Right, right.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>And this is where the story gets interesting because, EMUSIC-L, a lot of the academic music programs that were on the list were still teaching with analog gear. It was what they had. It was what was available. And it was a good pedagogical tool, because a subtractive synthesizer is a very straightforward thing to learn to use. A modular can be tremendously complicated, but a semi-modular or non-modular analog synth, or a modular that's been set up with a very straightforward voicing, is a very good way to learn the basics of tone shaping.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>Well, and it's reductive in a way that's really educational.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>Exactly. And you were doing Creative Synth and I was creating Reaktor patches for you to put up on the site. I was working in Reaktor and doing essentially subtractive synthesis as a way of learning how to do things. Reaktor lets you do a whole lot more. In version 2.5 it was a little more limited than it is now. 
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>Oh, remember when it was Generator?
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>Oh, yeah. The point is though you could teach with these tools. They were simple. They were straightforward. They were understandable. And everybody succumbed to some extent to the lure of digital. I mean, Gary Nelson at Oberlin bought a bunch of DX9s because FM was the wave of the future. And four-op, actually, is simple enough so that you could really learn to program it and do things with it that were very cool. 
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, and it was, you could at least intellectualize it fairly quickly. 
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>Yeah. A four-operator synthesizer with a limited number of ways that the operators can interact is something that even an analog head, who is used to the way analog synths work, could figure out how to do basic stuff with. And so, from a pedagogical standpoint, that was worthwhile. But once you learn how to use a four-op FM synthesizer, guess what you knew how to do, you knew how to do four-op FM. Whereas frequency modulation as a subject is something you could do with an analog synthesizer. Analog was bigger than that. You could do more with it. Once you got the basics under your belt, you added a module or you stretched out a little bit and there was room to grow.
    </p>

    <p>And the mailing lists were a great place for that, because you had people helping each other learn how this stuff all went together. And if somebody came up with a really cool technique that they found creatively inspiring, they would get on EMUSIC-L or SYNTH-L and they would say, look what I just did. And in the '80s, when there was very little in the way of instantaneous communication, and even less in the way of ultra-specialized communication for particular types of gear, now every manufacturer has a forum, but in the old days that information was hard to come by. And, I hate to sound like a Luddite here, but in the '80s, when I wanted to reach people to teach about the Oberheim Xpander, I printed a newsletter and I mailed it out.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>(Laughter) Right.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>Four times a year. Xpansions was how I got my start in the industry, teaching people and helping people teach each other. That was the whole beauty of EMUSIC-L and SYNTH-L. SYNTH-L very quickly became a swap meet, and that's okay, people didn't have a problem with it because the joke we used to make was, yeah, it is all about the gear (Laughter). But, EMUSIC-L was a valuable place for people to say, "This is what I'm doing in my musical creativity right now, what do you think?" And, "I just got this album and it sounds to me like this person who used to be very original is now resorting to clichés because they're relying on their gear too much, what do you think?" And a lot of these early tropes that we now really take for granted. The idea of the gear dictating how you compose. The idea of multitudeness options leading to paralysis. The idea of old versus new gear being good or bad. Whether or not you wanna be leading edge, or whether it's better to hang back and work with stuff that's been understood and has had the bugs worked out of it. The concept of the end user being forced to beta test gear because the manufacturer wants to bring it to market and is unwilling to wait until it's ready. These are things that are just part of our language now, they're part of our vocabulary. But in the '80s we were learning it and we were teaching it to each other.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>Well, yeah. And one of the places where that really struck home for me, that was one of the things that I have a tendency to rail on and on about is this idea of virtuosity with your instrument, regardless of what it is. I remember us having those discussions on EMUSIC-L and when the idea of "could you be a virtuoso of a drum machine" actually had to be debated, because people were like, well, you know, there was a group of people that said, you're not physically playing. There's not a physical part of this that's required for something that you would say is virtuosity. And there were other people that say, but it's an instrument that makes sound. And the sounds that it's making are valid and it's your responsibility to learn how to do the rhythms and how to make the sounds work right and all this stuff. And I remember having those discussions and it opening my mind to think differently about the work that we were doing, the musical work, the learning work that we were doing. That was an amazing, amazing resource.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>And what I would say in support of that is that this was when we really began as a community of people who did not go to Darmstadt and study under Stockhausen, to understand the idea that there's physical virtuosity and there's mental virtuosity. And it is possible to take a machine that does not necessarily have an extremely fine-grained physical interface and still become virtuoso with it by learning the parameter space that this instrument represents and mastering it. And that was a two-edged sword, because what you had was somebody like Wendy Carlos who stated famously any parameter that can be controlled must be controlled. If you do not exert conscious control over every parameter of the machine at your disposal then you're letting the machine do the work.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>Right.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>And on a Moog synthesizer, when Switched on Bach, Switched on Brandenburgs, Sonic Seasonings, TimeSteps, you know, The Clockwork Orange soundtrack, were the vogue, there was that sense of complete mastery, of the headspace really being under her control. Then she discovered digital synthesis and she discovered alternate tunings. And suddenly she was working with the Synergy and the Crumar General Development System, which were these open-ended digital synthesizers, programmed from Kaypro computers, that had thousands and thousands of parameters. And she put out a couple of brilliant albums, Digital Moonscapes and then Beauty in the Beast. And then she vanished. She completely vanished, because she could no longer follow her own dictum about headspace. She had to control everything and it became completely overwhelming. And, you know, mad props to Wendy. She's still alive, she's still out there, she's a wonderful woman and she has done work that all of us should burn incense in front of a statue of her for. But she was a victim of the march of technology. And, for a while, technology was at a point where you either were crushed under it, or you surfed on it. And MIDI and the arrival of affordable digital synthesis and the arrival of sequencing took a lot of bands that had made this virtuosity in the headspace with modular instruments their stock-in-trade, and turned them into preset players. You can point to the series of three or four albums in the mid 1980s when Tangerine Dream stopped being interested, because they didn't master their gear anymore. And it wasn't that the machinery had advanced beyond them, or that they had gotten lazy, it was the vocabulary had expanded beyond what they knew and in attempting to speak the new language they were talking baby talk.
    </p>

    <p>The flip side of this was, if you had an instrument that was tremendously rare, electronic, limited edition, something that you may or may not see very many of, and you got really, really good with it, up to and including physical virtuosity, you ran into a situation where you become a dinosaur. And the classical example of that, of course, is Oskar Sala and the Trautonium. Because the Mixtur-Trautonium was used on Hitchcock movies and God knows what all else, but Sala himself said before he died, I have a couple of students who are good but they're not me, and when I die, this instrument is going into a museum and it's going to vanish and no one will ever make these sounds again. It is very rare that an instrument of our century with this sort of technological limitation, if you will, survives. Generally when it does you have to have a very unique combination of beauty and expressiveness that makes it worth saving, and the level of technical simplicity that makes it easy to save. And the classic example of that is the Theremin, because a Theremin is not only a beautifully expressive instrument, but it's a terribly simple circuit. You know, how old was Bob Moog when he made his first one?
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>16 or something.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>Yeah, and he taught himself how to do it. This is the problem, and this is the dialogue, and this was some of the stuff that we were wrestling with when we were getting started and learning what this world of ours was going to be. And we grappled with the problems and it could be tremendously difficult for us. 
    </p>

    <p>[TECHNICAL PROBLEMS SOUND]</p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>All right. So, the Tascam DR-07MKII decided the card was full now and also maybe the battery wasn't so good and maybe I didn't wanna record anymore. And so we left the truck behind and we have moved into the studio area of my mountain hideaway to talk a little bit more. So why don't you continue. What I recall is that you and Nick Rothwell knew everything. And that was the point. (Laughs.)
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>The point I was trying to make was that there were, in these early mailing lists, a lot of the language and a lot of the tropes that we take for granted these days were still being decided. They were being argued about and sort of codified for the first time. And the one that Nick and I always used to have a lot of fun with was this idea of, I need a new synthesizer. I don't know what I need, but I need a new synthesizer. And the classic, I think, joke that Nick used to make was something to the effect of, I'm not sure what I wanna do right now. Do I wanna get a pet iguana or do I want to take up gardening? And the idea was that we had forgotten, I think to some extent, that while these things can be fun toys and while they can give us, I guess, a sense of joy and creativity just for messing around with them, they really are also tools for a real creative purpose. And if you say you need a new synthesizer, but you have no idea what it is that you need, basically what you're saying is you've run out of inspiration and you're looking to buy an artificial means of boosting that inspiration. And nowadays you can get away with that, I think, a little bit, in the era of iOS apps which cost a grand total of $10. But in the days when people were throwing around hundreds or thousands of dollars, you really had to have a sense of what you needed something for before you got it. Unless you were sort of philosophically saying, I feel like jumping off a cliff and I'm sort of curious as to whether I can learn to fly before I hit the ground.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>Well, I think that was some of it, though, I mean, and that was actually some of the fun, was doing that jump, at least it was for me. Although I have to admit that recently I picked up a compilation album by this guy, Charles Cohen, who is Pittsburgh, I think, based, or maybe Philadelphia based synthesist. 
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>Well, if he was in Pittsburgh he wasn't there when I was there. 
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>He's been around for ages because he has one of the original Buchla Music Easels. 
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>Oh, excuse me.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>And he has like hand built a couple of little extra bits onto it, but otherwise he's been using the same instrument and only that instrument forever. And it's been a real joy for me to kind of learn about his practice and learn about how he is able to take this very, relatively simple piece of gear and find endless inspiration out of it, apparently, because he's still doing it. Still with the same machine and the same little bits of gear. It's pretty wild.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>Well, that was actually something which I sort of enjoyed following really, throughout my career, is finding people who would choose a particular synthesizer and live with it and get really good. Probably the most famous example would be Vangelis, who, you know, he messed with samplers a little bit and he had other stuff in his rig, but he really was the master of the Yamaha CS-80. And he had six of them, because you needed six in order to have two that were working at any given time.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>(Laughter.)
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>Love those instruments. I don't know what it is about me and instruments that were just horribly temperamental, but hey, there you go. And then another example was, are you familiar with Anthony Phillips, one of the original members of Genesis? 
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>No.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>This is a story that everyone should know. The original band Genesis got together in high school and the four original members were Peter Gabriel, Tony Banks, Mike Rutherford and this guy named Anthony Phillips. And Anthony Phillips was the original guitarist, and he plays on the first two Genesis albums, he plays on From Genesis to Revelation and Trespass. But he developed crippling stage fright. And Anthony ended up finding that he could make a living as a musician only doing studio work. He did library work for TV stations and for movie companies and that sort of thing. He did soundtracks for some documentaries and that sort of thing. He put out a whole series of albums. And he was, he's one of these people you just hate because he was good at everything. He played guitar, he played any number of string instruments, he played keyboards very well. He was the sort of person who would release an album of solo twelve-string guitar pieces and then the very next album he released the following year would be solo grand piano (laughter) and they'd both be great. And you just hated the guy. But his whole thing was he didn't have a lot of money. He had a studio in a barn and would record this beautiful stuff. He had a rickety old piano and a huge collection of string instruments. But he owned a Polymoog, and the Polymoog, again, very heavy, very temperamental instrument, but very expressive when you played it. And he is the only person I know of who actually would do things like solo Polymoog improvisations, where he would do nothing but play Polymoog and work the timbre as he played to create these amazing sounds. And if you go back earlier to the days when synthesizers were tremendously rare and expensive, the '60s, you would have entire albums where it would be one person and one instrument. So you had everything from the famous people like Walter Carlos, and his Moog or Dick Hyman and his Moog, and the early stuff that was being done with Morton Subotnick on the early Buchla systems. But then you would have, you know, Stardrive and his album Intergalactic Trot. (Laughter.) Have you never heard of Stardrive?
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>(Laughing) No.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>Well, can't imagine why not. (Laughter.) I don't remember what the guy behind Stardrive what his name was, but he had a one of a kind synthesizer that used, I believe, a very early scanning multiplexing keyboard. So he had polyphony years before anybody else did. 
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b> Oh, wow.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>And he did this album of, you know, fairly tacky stuff, but it was all done with this one fairly customized instrument that he really knew inside and out. And you would have people like that. And I think to some extent in the early days of the EMUSIC-L groups and the people who hung around doing that kind of thing, that kind of virtuosity, where we're talking physical dexterity and headspace combining so that you have the artist and the tool really interacting with one another, the way Itzhak Perlman plays the violin, or the way Mstislav Rostropovich played the cello or the way Ivo Pogorelić played the grand piano. This was the instrument. And nobody ever felt that, you know… Perlman never felt he had to go out and get something to go with his violin. The violin was what he used. But then you fall into the trap that electronics dies.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Truly.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>And this is what I came back to with the Mixtur-Trautonium. A very difficult to use instrument, very delicate, temperamental. And if you didn't have a real reason to keep one working they went away. And one of the things that I look out for, and this is a topic for an entire other podcast, is looking at how people interact with instruments today and seeing what is ephemeral. What is not going to be here in two years that people are relying on right now. And what is here now that was here twenty years ago and will likely still be here in twenty years. As much as I hate to say it, Uncle Bob, when he put a Hammond organ keyboard on the first Moog, he set a trend in motion that a lot of people have complained about, but which may be the saving of the synthesizer as a melodic performance instrument. As long as it's married to something with centuries of pedagogy, like the organ keyboard, it's not gonna go away. 
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>Or at least it's not gonna be treated as purely…
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>A noise maker. 
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Or a novelty.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>Exactly.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>It's not a novelty act that we get tired of and toss out, because it does have that instrumentality that comes with having a keyboard. Right. That's really interesting.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>This is a whole other topic for conversation. The idea of the interaction between… well, it's actually how I got to where I am today. I wrote a huge treatise on EMUSIC-L called The Man Machine Interface, which was a 1988 vintage look at how people had been interacting with electronics for the past hundred years. And how we got technology to work and how some ideas go away and don't come back and some ideas have this way of resurfacing. You know, we talked about the Theremin. The other one that comes up every once in a while, though not nearly as often, is the Ondes Martenot.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>Uh-huh, right.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>And, I guess it's, help me out here. British module manufacturer, they design huge modules. Analogue Solutions? British maker?
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>Well, there's two. There's Analogue Solutions and Analogue Systems. And I can never remember which one is which.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>Yeah, neither do I, but one of them makes a controller keyboard called The French Connection. And The French Connection is a standard four octave synth keyboard with CVs in and out, but it's also got Martenot controls on it.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>Is that that little ring on a string?
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>Because the way the Ondes Martenot worked in the old days was it didn't actually have moving keys. It had a sculpture, a wooden sculpture of a keyboard to tell you where you were. You put your finger through a ring and as you moved your hand up and down the keyboard the ring was on a string that went through pulleys that changed the pitch of the instrument. So if you moved your hand to the right, the pitch went up. If you moved your hand to the left, the pitch went down. And you would have this very beautiful fluid keyboard technique that was rooted in the old black and whites, so you could tell where you were going, but didn't sound anything like a piano, or a clavichord, or a harpsichord, or anything along those lines. And The French Connection basically brought back the Ondes Martenot's user interface, with the ring that you could put your finger through while you played the actual keyboard or, instead of the actual keyboard, that generated a control voltage as you moved the string around, and the little button on the left that you would push to actuate notes, which is what you did for the Ondes Martenot. If something feels good people are gonna find a way to come back to it.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>Right. True enough.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>And the thing that I have always been fascinated by, and will probably forever be fascinated by in the technology side of this, is what people like to touch when it comes to music. How people like to interact. Because the one piece of technology that's in this business that was here first and will be here at the end and is for all of that, the crotchety-est, fussiest, most difficult to categorize and most difficult to keep operating on an even keel, is the human being. You know, people are tremendously nuanced and very difficult to force into pigeonholes, but they're the ones who ultimately end up using these instruments. 
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>Well, they tend to fall apart in an ingracious way as well (Laughter). As my stack of prescription medications there will tell, but… (Laughter). So we actually got to your kind of talking about the way that we used this early Internet to explore concepts. That, first of all, I don't think many people… I think it's the kind of concept that requires a conversation. This isn't generally something you're going to, you know, sit in your log cabin and after twenty years of deep thought come up with stuff. It has to exist within a kind of a panoply of different views and different beliefs about what's important and what's not. And that sort of like ends up coming together to create a concept. 
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>Well, let me give you a good example. There was, in 1989, a conversation that was going on. It was either on the Usenet news group rec.music.synth or it was on EMUSIC-L, one or the other. But two people, I don't even remember who they were, got into fight. And they were flaming each other and saying some pretty unforgivable things. And someone, finally, just in desperation as this conversation had reached fever pitch just said, "Look, you know, you really wouldn't be talking to me that way if I was sitting in the room with you."
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>Right.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>And I read that, then a little bell went off in my head, and I posted a message following up on whatever newsgroup it was. And I said, what would we say to each other if we were in the same room? Would anybody like to get together with me and sit in the same room for a while? And there was this resounding silence (Laughter) for about a day, and then one person, I don't know who was first, I think it was Nick Rothwell said, you know, I'd love to do that. I've never been to America. Yeah, can we get together? And then Carl Brenner, who was, he was at Columbia? One of the universities in Manhattan, said, yeah, fly to New York, Nick, I'll drive with you down to Pittsburgh. And then, Dan Barrett of Blazemonger, jumped in and said, sure, you know, Maryland's not that far away, I can get to Pittsburgh, it shouldn't be that hard. And there were some people who couldn't make it. Pete Yadlowsky thought he would come up from Charlottesville, but he was never able to make it. Jim Lee stopped in to say hello. But then, and we had people who, you know, Adam Schabtach, who is now known as one of the creative folks at Audio Damage. That was how he got into the community. He wasn't able to come to that first meeting, but he sent himself virtually by sending MIDI files. And there were eight of us. John Rossi III, came from Wright Patterson Air Force Base. He connected in via MILNET. And who else was there? Kurt Geisel. I miss you Kurt. If you're out there, call me would you, Kurt? Kurt was a computer wunderkind. He was still in college. He was maybe 20 years old. His basement had one of everything, when it came to personal computers. He was an expert at coding on the IBM PC. He had a Macintosh II, he had an Amiga running Bars and Pipes, he had an Atari and he had an Apple II with a chip burner. And he had a Matrix 12, and he had a Polymoog in perfect working order that he heated his parents' house with during the winter (Laughter). Seriously! He left it on all the time because if you'd turn them off they'd go unstable. So from October to April the thing was on and it heated the house (Laughter). Anyway, eight of us got together. I'm probably forgetting somebody, but it'll come back to me. Oh, Dean Swan. Who now does data analysis for a company in upstate New York near the Canadian border. And he was a real firebrand. He loved arguing, not just for the sake of arguing but because he couldn't abide bad mental processes. He liked things to be clear and clean. And we got together in Pittsburgh and people brought gear and we were together for two weeks and we recorded an album, which is, by the way, still available on CD Baby. It was called Bandwidth. And the name of the group was Team Metlay, which, by the way, everybody wonders, did he name it after… It was actually a redemption of an insult. To be a member of Team Metlay, if you were in the physics department at the University of Pittsburgh in the 1980s, meant that you were somebody who failed your qualifying exams.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>(Laughter) Okay. I was actually gonna ask, does it feel weird to have named this thing after yourself? Now I understand a little better.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>Well, it was a sort of a redemption of this view that the scientific community had of me as a failure. Which was funny as hell since I actually went on to do a pretty good job of it before I changed careers. But, that's another story. Several other stories. Maybe an entire anthology. Anyway.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>(Laughter.)
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>The point is we got these eight guys together. We spent two weeks together and we ate a lot of food, we drank a lot of beer. We recorded an album, it was about forty-three minutes. And when you go back and listen to it, there's some stuff in it that's dated, but it's really pretty. And I'm really proud of it. And I wish more people heard it. One thing, which I still haven't mastered, is marketing myself. But Bandwidth was the first of the Team Metlay sessions. And what ended up happening was for the next ten years, every two years or so, I would get a bunch of these guys together and we would hang out and make music. And sometimes it worked really well. And sometimes it didn't. And we got three albums out of the process. Bandwidth was the first, it was recorded in '90 and not released until '93, because guess what? Back in the early '90s, if you wanted to put out CDs, it was about a $5,000 proposition.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, it was outrageous.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>Bandwidth was one of the first completely independently funded CDs. And it was expensive. Then, in '95, I was about to release Ballistic, which was the second album, when you and I met. The album had just arrived from the press and you got one of the first copies…
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>Yes, I did. Right.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>…because came to visit me in Tallahassee. And I cracked open one of the crates and let you have it. And then the last album, Beneath Stars, actually you played on the last little bit of and helped me master and get out the door years after it was over.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>Yep.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>And that was the last (laughter)… Another conversation, the evolution of physical product in the world of recorded music from being absolutely essential to being something that you build furniture out of. 
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>Right.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>My last fully produced duplicated run of a thousand CDs… never doing that again (laughter). But the point was that in amongst the music and the recording and everything else, there was this fantastic set of dialog. And I'd like to think that it got folded back into the more general dialog of the creative community. That there is something vital and something important and something beautiful that happens when we all get together in a room and we talk. And I don't think people in this industry talk nearly enough. I think everybody's very content to troll and flame one another from the safety of their homes and to not set foot outside of their forums and their social media. People create on their own and live and die on their own. And one of the things that I love about the community is that against that tremendous tide of isolation and loneliness and apathy, there are these groups of people who still insist on getting together and talking to each other and creating together. It's so important. And really, I think all of the best work that I have done in my long and very spotty career, it has been in concert with like-minded people. I've done a few solo pieces that I'm kind of proud of, but far and away, they're outnumbered by the stuff that I've done working with people that I love.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>Well you make the joke about Team Metlay being related to this failure vector in school. I would say that you were sort of the ring leader of that group for a couple of reasons. First of all, you're an engaged and engaging person in an environment where there are an awful lot of extremely shy or introverted people. And so by being willing to say, let's do it, come on, let's go, that was actually a rarity because most people are like, well, I'd say that, but then people would look at me. (Laughter.) Right? You know?
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>Well, you know, you're being very kind. I've always looked at it as basically being a babbling idiot with, fortunately, an enthusiastic streak. I have always been interested in the interactions of people. People are fascinating. People, are, I… What novel was it? It was Illuminatus, where somebody says, the most weird, messed up impossible to pigeonhole, getting back to the same idea, the most weird, impossible, messed up, difficult to pigeonhole thing in the universe full of difficult things is the individual human being. And watching how individual human beings rub together and how they produce conflict and how they produce agreement is just fascinating to me. And music is the way in which I prefer to do that because music is naturally collaborative. And all of the projects that I have done have been collaborative to some extent or another. Some of them have died horribly because of interpersonal conflicts. Some of them I've actually managed to wrap up with a certain degree of grace. But that's always gonna be my theme. You know, in the 1990s, it was Team Metlay from '90 until '99. In the 2000s it was the Different Skies concerts. Ten years of getting these groups of people from all over the world to come together for one week on one stage and write music together.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, for those of you who don't know, they were held down in Arcosanti and were… It was an amazing thing to put together. It's clearly, you know, it's one of those things that's gonna be, sort of, of historical importance, I think, in the electronic music world.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>Well, I'd like to think so. And some good music came out of it, which is available out there, actually. Various of the festivals have been preserved in varying degrees of polish. One of these days the 2010 festival, which everybody agrees was the best, except the folks who weren't there (laughter), sorry, will get released. Actually, Paul Vnuk Jr. has a beautiful recording of our live concert from that night, including the encore, which basically consists of three notes, and then me screaming, "Rain!" (laughter). Because what we couldn't see was there was a thunderstorm coming up over the valley and it was behind us and the audience actually saw it coming at us. It was a pretty amazing experience (laughter) and we learned just how fast you can tarp a stage (laughter). But, again, ten years, every year, getting a group of people together for these. And there are a bunch of great Different Skies stories. But the central theme is people who normally don't interact or who interact in a very small controlled environment, stepping out of their comfort zone and opening themselves up, to an extent, to others and saying, this is what I am, this is how I create, is there something here that you can use? Is there something here that you can work with?
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>Right.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>And, when it hit, it was beautiful. It was magical. And, you know, the biggest cliché of my career, the one catchphrase that I've used over and over again for going on twenty-five years now is, I do not collect synthesizers anymore. Now I collect synthesists.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>(Laughter.)
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>And the biggest treasure in my life is the friends I've made and the collaborations and the creative partnerships that have come out of it. Some have worked well. Some have worked poorly. There have been ones that, you know, one shining moment of brilliance that produced a fantastic album followed by decades of stony silence because the people involved won't talk to each other anymore.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>(Laughter.)
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>And then there have been other collaborations that keep coming up again and again, and producing little bits of things that sneak out as Creative Commons, or on a net label somewhere, and that people drop me an email and say, Mike, where are you these days? I'd love to hear more. Because I just found Shriek.Void, or Triangulum, or Curiosa Positronica, or Metric, or eocene on the web. And it was like, what are you doing nowadays? And it's always nice, because that always gives me the opportunity if the other person's a musician to say, oh, what are you doing nowadays? (Laughter) You gotta little free time? (Laughter) And then, if they're smart, they hang up (Laughter), and if they're not smart, then it's another mindSpiral project (Laughter).
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>So, I wanted… So, Usenet doesn't exist anymore. I mean, sort of, yeah.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>Well, it does, but it's now completely overrun by spambots. People discovered that you could post to Usenet. And literally when the spambot was invented, within the space of six months, signal-to-noise ratio went through the basement and people stopped using it. 
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>Right. And mail lists are sort of like passé at this point. I think what it is, is the mail list is where what I like to call nano-communities live. But, you know, from in sort of like the broader view, they're not really the locus of things. Now things tend to be Facebook stuff and Twitter stuff and forums. And you don't really engage in those very much.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>No, I hate them. Because the tendency is, if you open the door too wide, you will increase the number of worthwhile people walking through the door by a small but measurable percentage, and you'll increase the number of yahoos who are looking for somebody to make noise at by a much, much larger percentage. And I know that makes me sound terribly arrogant and snobbish, and I'm sorry. But have you ever tried to get real intellectual satisfaction from a discussion threat on Facebook? It doesn't happen very often. It happens, but it doesn't happen very often. And Twitter is worse. You know it was George Bernard Shaw who said any philosophy that can be put in a nutshell belongs there.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>(Laughter.)
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>And as cool as it is for somebody like Tim Walters to write a SuperCollider patch that fits in a tweet, that's about all they're really good for. I am not convinced that 140 characters is some magical, mystical gateway to enlightenment (laughter) and conciseness of thought. I believe in limitations. I believe that if you have infinite options you get paralyzed. But 140 characters?
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>It's hard to find Buddha there, huh?
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>It's a little hard to find Buddha there. You can find Bu…
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>(Laughter.)
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>So, the mailing list still has a use. I mean, I still run the Different Skies mailing list, which is for enthusiasts of the concert series and the people who participated in it and hope to participate in it again. Fat chance! (Laughter.) And I'm a member of some others. The beyond_em mailing list was one that did very well for about a decade. These days it's very, very quiet, because people are finding other ways to engage. But I'm not sure how effective those other ways are. Because the other place where you can create focus, and this is a danger, one of the ways in which you can create focus and dialogue is if you own the forum. And a lot of the things that you're seeing now are forums that are owned by record labels. Probably the one that's best known to followers of ambient music in the states would be Hypnos Records, Mike Griffin's label out of Portland. Great people, great labels, but there, to some extent, fortunately, not a lot, because Mike is a very egalitarian guy, there is some extent that the intent is, at least if not for Hypnos alone, that the people who are out there are doing commercial CD releases, or whatever. MusicZeit was the same way. And then you also run into the problem, this was true thirty years ago, it's still true now, of a sort of elitism that can creep in with a certain community if you have a group of people who have hung around long enough, and they've made their bones in a particular forum, they can not always be terribly pleasant. There are Pro Audio forums out there that I read professionally that I don't post to, because I have no particular interest in joining that dialogue. It's interesting to watch. Some of it is very useful. Some of it's very worthwhile. I have nothing to say to these people.
    </p>

    <p>So it's an ongoing thing, and it's going to keep evolving. The problem is that, right now, technology has us by the nose and it is dragging us. And we can only control where we end up to a certain extent, because, to some extent, the technology is dictating where we end up. If something is new and exciting and we can make it better and faster and smarter, we do it. And we often don't realize the consequences for things like community and dialog until long after the barn door is open, and the horse has gone. You know, we had no idea. Can you imagine what sort of a dialogue we would've had in the electronic creativity community if we had smartphones on day one? (Laughter.) If everyone in the world could suddenly jump into the conversation at once? I think it was a blessing that the conversation started narrow and gradually broadened. And I'm not ashamed of the fact that I was one of the first. I'm grateful. I'm blessed. I'm lucky. I'm not ashamed. It was a wonderful thing. And it was a wonderful time. And I do miss it sometimes. But, nostalgia? Let's be honest. The people who were doing the really cool stuff with analog, modular synthesizers these days are not the people who refused to buy anything that was built after 1975.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>Right.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>I mean, analog synthesis is not about nostalgia anymore.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>Right.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>We have reclaimed what made analog synthesis great. The immediacy. The tactile feedback. The sense of impermanence. The sand painting nature of the analog workflow, when you have patch cables and potentiometers and switches. And I mean, look at, you know… Yeah, okay. Moog's stuff was great. When I was living in Tallahassee, the husband of the woman who ran the daycare center where my infant daughter spent her first year of life was a former Moog technician. He worked for Bob Moog in Buffalo before he and his wife moved to Tallahassee. And he had a customized Moog System 15 in his basement, covered in sawdust. And a friend of mine drove all the way to Tallahassee to buy it off of him, only to get it home and discover that a lot of the modules didn't work, and the ones that this guy had custom designed were often wired in ways that anyone who had ever read Horowitz and Hill can tell you that a circuit shouldn't be built (laughter), you know, including capacitors backwards. And, you know, voltage divider networks that were grounded in two points.
    </p>


    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>(Laughter.) Oh, man.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>And just things that, you know, brilliant ideas on paper, wonderful looking faceplates. And behind those… ugh! (Laughter.) And the point is that now you've got… I mean… I'm looking over here at this beautiful TipTop skiff, and you've got stuff by Mutable Instruments and Make Noise. And these people aren't looking backwards. 
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>No.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>They've taken the really great stuff and they've added stuff that you couldn't do outside the 21st century. And what I love is that, that was all done because of dialog. You know, they figured out what was needed. Nobody who builds these modern modules sits in his basement and doesn't talk to anybody.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>That's really true. And, you know, I certainly see that when I go to these synth meetups. I was up in Portland visiting the Control Voltage store, and just a stream of people coming in. And there's something about, you know, we gather on these instruments and two people who've never… I mean, I'm just standing there, like, twirling a knob and random people would walk in, look at the knob that I'm twirling and either say, oh, you know, I've got one of those and it's sweet, or I've got one of those and I wish I would've got this, or, yeah, that's a cool looking module, what do you know about it? And it's an interesting community because there is that kind of interest in discussion and all. So.
    </p>

    <p>Well, Mike, thank you so much for taking your time to talk to me and to talk to the podcasters. I've got a bunch of other things I wanna talk to you. We're gonna have another discussion where we go back to distribution methods and talk about the cassette culture. I want to do that. As well as like the early CD culture, which is, it was interesting that you brought that up. I had forgotten about that, but that was how we first started, sort of like, working on music together, was I helped master the second CD I think it was.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>No, it was the third. And, you also did a lot of work rescuing the Ozma project. 
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>Oh, that's right, yeah. 
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>Ozma - A Huge and Silent Place, still available at cdbaby.com.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>(Laughter.)
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>Sorry, guys, I gotta get plugs in, I sell maybe three CDs a year these days, but, you know, anything that helps. 
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>Oh, I remember the other thing I did was I worked with Nick on his CD. 
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>Yeah, that's right. The Cassiel CD.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>Yeah.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>Yeah. I have the actual, the singular honor of being the only person ever to have released a physical product that has Nick Rothwell's music on it. Cassiel's Listen/Move album was an Atomic City release.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>That's right. That is a phenomenal album, too.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>I've been very lucky in the people that I've worked with.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, no kidding.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>And we've got lots of stuff we can talk about. We've been going on and we could go on for hours. But I had a blast and I really appreciate you having me out to talk and to share this stuff, because this is what I do. This is dialog. And it's so much fun. And certainly, if anybody has any comments, positive or negative, you know, Darwin will forward them to me. I'd love to hear from you. I wish I could say that I had a comprehensive website of a lot of this history and so forth ready for you to go to when you hear this podcast. Alas, I do not, but it is in the process of being updated for the first time in many years. If you are the sort to be patient, over this summer of 2014, atomiccity.com will gradually come back together. I'm gonna have a WordPress blog and various other things happening, including some word about future concerts. I will put in one quick plug. I will be playing at the Fort Collins Museum of Discovery on Thursday, June 19 2014 at 7PM. They have an organization that's worth an entire conversation in and of itself called the Dome Club, which is an informal gathering of creators and consumers of planetarium style 360 degree immersive video.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>Oh, nice.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>And where they show experimental short films. And they do work with 360 degree camera and sound. It's a beautiful little theater. They just built it. It's less than a year old. And they're looking for creative people and I'm gonna do a concert. I'm gonna have a… I don't know whether it'll be solo or whether I'll be playing with, you know, putting together a mindSpiral group. But it's June 19th, and I'm really hoping that if you are in the Northern Colorado area, that you make a trip. fcmod.org is the website and, even if you don't make my concert, if you're in the area it's a great little museum that is looking for creative people to work with and to build community. And that's what's always gonna come back to you. 
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>That's fantastic. Thanks a lot, Mike, and we'll talk again really soon. 
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Mike: </b>Thanks, Darwin.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Darwin: </b>And there it is. As you can see I had to make all kinds of quality compromises in order to capture the conversation, including some pretty radically icky uses of noise reduction plugins. Never a good idea, but necessary in this case. So I hope that you can get past the quality issues and actually enjoy the podcast, because it was really interesting and fun to talk with Mike Metlay. I want to, again, thank everyone that is helping out as well as everyone that's listening in on the podcast. And I hope you continue to enjoy it. As always, if you have any questions, comments, or if you want to throw rotten tomatoes at Mike Metlay, feel free to email me, ddg@cycling74.com. Thanks a lot and I'll see you next week.
