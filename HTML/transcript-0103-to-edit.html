<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, today I have the great fortune to speak to someone who I've been following for a long time, whose work in many different ways I really appreciate, and who is also the, the label runner for a label with one of my more recent releases. So, with that, I'm gonna introduce you to <span style="color:red" data-ts="32.185" data-end_ts="32.425" title="32.185" id=c_"32.185">__Carrie__</span> Lier. <span style="color:red" data-ts="32.905" data-end_ts="33.145" title="32.905" id=c_"32.905">__Carrie__</span>, how are you today? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kerry Leimer: </b>I'm well, thanks. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm great. Thanks so much for taking time out of your schedule to chat with us. I am really excited to talk to you. Like I said in the intro there, I've been kind of following you for a long time from afar. And then, recently I got to sort of work with you in the release of the latest, Gregory Taylor duet album with me. So, I want to first of all thank you for, helping us with that. And secondly, thank you for your many years of fantastic work, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kerry: </b><laugh>. Well, that's very flattering. Thanks for saying so. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So first of all, for people who have, who are not familiar with your work, why don't you fill us in a little bit on, both your musical work and your label work? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kerry: </b>Well, the musical work started, in the late seventies, and it was really an offshoot from a, a decade where I think <span style="color:red" data-ts="91.065" data-end_ts="91.185" title="91.065" id=c_"91.065">__a__</span>, a lot of people write off, but when you look at it, you know, from the perspective of obscure and underground music was, you know, a phenomenally exciting period with a lot of artists coming to the fore. I mean, you've got, artists like, Gavin Breyer sinking of the Titanic, Michael Neiman's Decay music, David <span style="color:red" data-ts="109.695" data-end_ts="109.985" title="109.695" id=c_"109.695">__Tope__</span>, of course, the Brian Eno stuff. You've got, a lot of things happening in Germany with <span style="color:red" data-ts="114.885" data-end_ts="115.105" title="114.885" id=c_"114.885">__Can__</span> and Faust and Noy and Michael Rother and cluster and on and on. So all of this was sort of what I was waiting to hear, I think, because up until that point, I was just not engaged or impressed or compelled to be interested in pop or rock, which, you know, seemed cute and interesting and kind of had a false social conscience about it, but really wasn't doing anything all that remarkable in my mind. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kerry: </b>And that, that sort of music, especially the simpler kinds of machine <span style="color:red" data-ts="146.585" data-end_ts="146.865" title="146.585" id=c_"146.585">__driven__</span> things that started out with the <span style="color:red" data-ts="148.445" data-end_ts="148.665" title="148.445" id=c_"148.445">__Noy__</span> and with Cluster and, some others seemed very accessible to me. And of course, you know, you get a little rhythm box and an old tape recorder and something to bang on, and the next thing you know, you can kind of put some little facsimile of that together. And, it began as that sort of just desire to emulate some things that I liked a great deal. Of course, along with that, the equipment started to improve and, well, I say by the late, mid to late seventies, you had some credible multi-track machines that were within, you know, an affordable price range and a little mixer and, you know, had the advent of some, very small and affordable Moog synthesizers, like the micro <span style="color:red" data-ts="189.595" data-end_ts="189.885" title="189.595" id=c_"189.595">__Moog__</span>, and then the mini and everything that proliferated from there of course. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kerry: </b>So, so it wasn't an expensive thing to do, and it wasn't, it wasn't a difficult thing to do. It was a great pleasure to set that stuff up and to learn how it worked and to become something, you know, in this gray area, sort of dilettante that I am, that has to be an engineer and a composer and a performer. And to be able to do so without looking at the clock or worrying about running up, you know, a $300 an hour bill at a studio. I'm not sure what else I can tell you about it. It just sort of became, not necessarily obsessive, but it became kind of a practice for me, and it steadily escalated. We managed to go from the small multi-tracks to, a large 30 IPS kind of studio, and then finally, into the sometimes more complex but equally rewarding digital phase. And, it's just, yeah, it's just a practice. It's just something that makes the days worthwhile. It's something that directs and focuses my attention. It, it can be very frustrating many times, but it seems like a worthwhile pursuit. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. That's a really great introduction to your, your thoughts and your process in doing this. And it's really, kind of a pretty fascinating thing to think of going all the way from the early kind of, semi-pro multi-track gear to the kind of things that we have now. In your mind and in your work, what were, what were some of the most <span style="color:red" data-ts="286.585" data-end_ts="286.805" title="286.585" id=c_"286.585">__pro__</span> profound changes that happened, whether it was an equipment or whether it was access to an audience? What were some of the things that were profound changes to you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kerry: </b>Well, I think the most profound change is always going to be, the, the work of others. I mean, I, I believe that, you know, the expansion of what has become not only possible, but accepted as music is just a profoundly rich and encouraging and inviting series of events. The argument about sound or noise being music, I think was settled, you know, in the forties and fifties, although people still continue to argue those sorts of things today. But when you look at the, the escalation in, in complexity and composition and execution, and you look at the proliferation of genres, and I'm not really a genre fan, but, when you look at how, how, you know, how diverse that's become and how finely tuned those little, little genres are, I, I think it's really remarkable. I, I can recall when I was away from it for a while, being generally discouraged again by what I was hearing just in, you know, commercial music, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kerry: </b>But the fact of the matter is <span style="color:red" data-ts="360.265" data-end_ts="360.485" title="360.265" id=c_"360.265">__on__</span>, on the, on the underground side, on the independent side of things, the innovation just reached an alarming pace. And of course, now it's, I think, at least for me, impossible to keep up with. But things keep coming through. Things keep coming through from more traditional forms of practice to completely experimental forms of practice. And I guess that's really the most fascinating thing for me is that it just ain't gonna sit still. It's not gonna stop changing. It's not gonna stop expanding, and it just continues to get more and more fascinating. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, abso absolutely. That's, that's fantastic. Now, I'm curious how you got, how you personally got started doing releases. 'cause now you have label Palace of Lights, which we'll talk about more in a minute, but what were, how were you doing your first releases? Were you doing like cassette releases or were you doing independent pressings of vinyl? What, how were how did you get started getting your work out? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kerry: </b>Well, it first began with, with cassettes, and that was, you know, it's, it's all always been and will always be quite small. But yeah, it began with cassettes and there were some, you know, enthusiast magazines, little underground things that would, oh, you know, let's see, experimental music, <span style="color:red" data-ts="441.985" data-end_ts="442.205" title="441.985" id=c_"441.985">__ROC__</span> there were a number of little West coast publications that had a bit of a network and they would review and sometimes, distribute that material. So we did a few cassettes. I did, I did a couple, mark <span style="color:red" data-ts="454.025" data-end_ts="454.445" title="454.025" id=c_"454.025">__Baraka__</span> did some, and as the equipment improved and our approach improved, it seemed like a natural step to go onto vinyl. So the first Palace of Lights releases were, you know, vinyl pressings. They were, we would do, I think about 3000, something like that. And, a network of distributors had kind of grown up along with that. And I think the best at the time was new music distribution. I don't know if you remember those guys. Yeah, I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kerry: </b>Absolutely. Yeah. Part of jazz composers and, green World, a couple of others. And it got to be sort of the, the wimpy thing, you know, it's like, well, we'll gladly pay you for the release we have when you send us a new one, kind of a, kind of a process. So, it, it, it will never have been a money maker, and it really hasn't been, and it really wasn't the concern. But, yeah, we, we were finally able to just kind of get to these small, small addition pressings and sell them through those distributors in some direct, it was, a much slower and, you know, limiting process compared to digital distribution today. But, it was fine. I mean, it was, there was a great deal of satisfaction in producing an album on your own terms, and, and having it, presented as a finished and professional product and having a kind of self-defined audience that was already interested in that sort of work, you know? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, it's hard to bring converts to it, and I really wouldn't care to try, but, but, you know, we've always been there, right. And we're always gonna listen to what people do on their own, and, and if it's interesting and worthwhile, it'll survive for a bit. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That's really, that's, that's pretty fascinating. Now, let's talk a little bit about your label Pal <span style="color:red" data-ts="561.845" data-end_ts="562.045" title="561.845" id=c_"561.845">__of__</span> Lights. It's a, you know, it's a relatively small label, but it seems like it has <span style="color:red" data-ts="569.125" data-end_ts="569.245" title="569.125" id=c_"569.125">__a__</span>, a consistency that really speaks to me. And so I'm a, I'm kind of a big fan, and, a lot of it, and not just because, my friend Gregory is on label, but I find especially your work and, the, the latest, collaborative work you did. I can't remember the name of it off the top of my head. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kerry: </b>Oh, the Pale Catalog? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Yeah. I, I just, I found that just completely fascinating. And so the, the process of putting together a label, and especially now when, the, the idea of a label seems passe. How do you, how do you maintain, first of all, the label itself, and secondly, how do you maintain a consistency? I mean, is it just based on your feel and, and working with the people whose work you love? Or is there, are there other influences that kind keep you on track? And how do you, how do you keep it afloat? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kerry: </b>Well, there's a lot of questions, <span style="color:red" data-ts="632.525" data-end_ts="632.725" title="632.525" id=c_"632.525">__though__</span>. Yeah. There are a <span style="color:red" data-ts="633.405" data-end_ts="633.445" title="633.405" id=c_"633.405">__lot__</span> of question, if I can remember 'em, to the end here. You know, in terms of its consistency, I think that's due to the fact that if you look at it, it's a pretty small group of artists. We've done things for Steve Peters and, we've done things for AMO <span style="color:red" data-ts="648.665" data-end_ts="648.885" title="648.665" id=c_"648.665">__Foe__</span> and, mark <span style="color:red" data-ts="650.215" data-end_ts="650.565" title="650.215" id=c_"650.215">__Barco__</span> I've worked with and around for decades now. And of course, my own work, Gregory came to us out of an attraction for the work as it exists. So, you know, it's a pretty self-regulating thing. It's not really, there's not really an outreach on our part, to find or attract new artists. It's mostly, I mean, I, I tend to think of it more as a library of, you know, reference works for people who are interested in specifically this kind of an aesthetic. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kerry: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="678.085" data-end_ts="678.325" title="678.085" id=c_"678.085">__Sure__</span>. So, you know, we're not actively pursuing stuff. The whole thing has been very passive in that regard. And, and I think part of the passivity is, is due to the fact, and I can't speak for Greg, but for pretty much everyone else I know, is that it's not a commercial venture. I mean, not to be, not to be didactic about it, but, you know, commercialism, the influence of having to make a profit, the influence of having to appeal to an audience. I, I've tended to experience these things as fairly corrupting influences, and we could certainly pursue broader distribution and bigger market and, you know, more attention. But that's really never been kind of a personal goal of myself or, or the people that have been involved in this. So it's just, yeah, I mean, I, I guess I haven't really, verbalized that before, but I guess thinking of it more as a library than, you know, a commercial enterprise is not a bad, is not a bad example, or not a bad metaphor. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kerry: </b>And, and keeping it afloat then, has just been pretty much the economic effect of being able to have good studio equipment within your own grasp. I, I mean, you know quite well how much studio time can run and engineering and on and on and on. But once you eliminate that, I mean, really, what are you talking about? And you're, you're talking about your own time and your own interest and things that you're personally committed to, to accomplish with your art. And I've always found that to be the intrinsic reward in the process, not sales or acclimation or Right. Or whatever, <laugh>, I mean, whatever people are looking for. I mean, you know, just honestly, sometimes when you look at the way entertainment and commerce interact with music, it's, it's sort of, at least from my perspective, appalling. I mean, it just, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. You call it interaction, I think of it as almost a collision, you know, <laugh>. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kerry: </b>That's probably a better term. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So one of the things that really is really striking when you first, trip across your label is that not only does the music have kind of a consistent beauty and an aesthetic, but also it's matched up with real beautiful graphics. And, I think that there's a story there, but I'm not sure, can you tell me how is it that you tie in a visual aesthetic with the music? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kerry: </b>Well, my, my profession, my, my, my income producing profession was, was design, graphic design. And so that was what I went to school for, and that is what I studied, and that is what I practiced. So I would assume there's a bit of skill that I picked up with all that that's applied to the way the label works. And again, you know, if you have a particular aesthetic of minimalism and, you know, lack of flourish and decoration, I think that translates pretty well across any sort of medium that, that you <span style="color:red" data-ts="861.685" data-end_ts="861.805" title="861.685" id=c_"861.685">__want__</span> to pursue. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That's, that makes a lot of sense. Interesting. So, let's talk about, your music making, and particularly how you got to be, the sort of complex artist that, that you've become. Tell me a little bit about your background. Like growing up, were you part of a musical family? Did you take on music early or was it a later pursuit? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kerry: </b>Well, <laugh>, my, I I've had to tell this story a number of times now with, a, a bunch of interviews for the, you know, the retrospective revenge re <span style="color:red" data-ts="897.085" data-end_ts="897.405" title="897.085" id=c_"897.085">__issues__</span> and, <laugh>. And, sometimes I laugh and sometimes I cry. My, my parents were immigrants or, and they, they came from, you know, world War ii, decimated Europe to Canada where I was born, and then later to the us and their, their taste in music or their interest in music was, fairly non-existent. I think. I mean, you know, unless you think playing a Dean Martin record is an interest in music, then, then that's kind of where that begins and ends. <laugh>. They did, they were kind enough to think that I should have a musical education. And I remember two things. One, trying to be taught accordion, which was actually, <span style="color:red" data-ts="942.525" data-end_ts="942.645" title="942.525" id=c_"942.525">__I__</span>, I think an interesting instrument. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kerry: </b>And if you know anything about Mark Barca, he, he does a lot of accordion work on his, on his recordings. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But, but what I remember most about it was having these, I don't know, kind of newsprint fold out, patterns that you'd lay on the floor so that you could learn to do <laugh>, these dance steps while you were trying to play these pul <span style="color:red" data-ts="966.385" data-end_ts="966.605" title="966.385" id=c_"966.385">__and__</span> there <laugh>. So that was my first brush with music. And of course, I found that kind of uninteresting <laugh> <laugh>. I did, however, really like piano, and I, when I got to be a little older, like eight 10, I begged to have a piano and, and learned piano. So of course my parents being somewhat responsive to this, went to some store and got talked into buying an organ <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kerry: </b>No. Which, which is a very different instrument. And, you know, the lessons then, at least that I were, were given were just basically learning melodies by rote. There was no theory or improvising or, or anything. So I, I didn't really have much of a musical education, but things did become quite interesting to me because, as I mentioned, my folks were immigrants. They still had family back in Austria, back in Vienna. And instead of writing letters, they decided they'd exchanged little tapes, you know, reel <span style="color:red" data-ts="1017.685" data-end_ts="1017.805" title="1017.685" id=c_"1017.685">__to__</span> reel tapes at that time. Right. And they had a little, reel <span style="color:red" data-ts="1021.205" data-end_ts="1021.325" title="1021.205" id=c_"1021.205">__to__</span> reel player. And, you know, things were always going wrong with the tape. I mean, the speed would be off, or, you know, something would print through, wouldn't erase properly, so you'd get this kind of fake multi-tracking on these garbled voices and tails out and put it in backwards. And that started to interest me profoundly. So I'd guess around the age of 10 or so, I, I finally got a little slicing block and a razor blade and, and some tape and, you know, just started cutting stuff up and making weird little noises into the microphone or recording things falling or dropping or running. And, just started putting together little tape collages and, and always enjoyed that and just continue somewhat in that main today. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's interesting. Is that one, like, one of those things with the little three inch reels? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kerry: </b>I think these took up to five. I, I can't remember, but, you know, very slow tape speed. It was an Iowa, if that's correct, the correct pronunciation. Oh, yeah. Had a little speaker in the, in the thing, you know, and a little kind of microphone with a cheapy stand and, you know, just, you know, just, just the thing that as small as they could make it at that time, you know, before truly portable stuff was available, or cassette or anything else. And of course, the things you I was doing with real, really, you couldn't convincingly do with cassette. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1102.345" data-end_ts="1102.565" title="1102.345" id=c_"1102.345">__So__</span> That's true. That is true. Kind of fortuitous. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, it's interesting 'cause my, you know, I, I have to admit that this is sort of a thing that I don't remember very well, but we also had one of these little, I think my, my father had gotten it for like doing dictation, and of course, he never wanted to dictate anything. And, and conversely, I was fascinated by the spinning reels and the, and the microphone. And so I did that. But yeah, the ability to like flip the tape over and play things backwards, I mean, something that people who start off with cassette didn't really have that easily No. And under their fingers. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kerry: </b>No, I mean, you had, you had all that stuff. You had, you know, mangling the tape you had, right. You had, you had reversing it, you had speed changes, you know, you had quite a library of things you could do. Right. And in combination and in juxtaposition, they could be quite interesting. I thought. So, yeah, that was, I mean, and that was pure fun. And, you know, alluding again to the, you know, design background, I had started drawing as, I think at the age of seven, I just kind of started spontaneously drawing, and, you know, drawing was a lot of work, but the thing that was immediately satisfying about tape was you could make a few noises or whatever, and you could hear it immediately, and then you could cut it up immediately. And there was something very fast and spontaneous about it that my experience with other sorts of forms, was not Right. So, so it was, it was sort of instantly gratifying in a, in a silly kind of way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That's, that's, that's right. So, one <span style="color:red" data-ts="1198.805" data-end_ts="1199.005" title="1198.805" id=c_"1198.805">__thing__</span> other thing I'm curious about, because, another similarity between you and me was this idea of a music teacher kind of teaching you melodies by rote rather than learning any kind of musical theory. So at some point I bailed out of that and I picked up a guitar, and you know, there, it's sort of like, here's chords, here's keys. And I, I sort of stumbled into music theory that way. What was the thing that kind of helped you grasp music theory? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kerry: </b>Well, it was really a process of just, of just learning on my own and then learning with some people that I either collaborated with or was around quite a bit. You know, it was, it was, early, very early. It was just trying very hard to be polite <laugh> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1246.925" data-end_ts="1247.205" title="1246.925" id=c_"1246.925">__because__</span>, you know, not really knowing that there was a way to use a B and a C together, right. <laugh>, right. Just kind of keeping the notes far enough apart so you didn't sound too dissonant. And then letting <span style="color:red" data-ts="1259.055" data-end_ts="1259.405" title="1259.055" id=c_"1259.055">__thing__</span>, you know, things just start to slip into the work so you hit a wrong note or you think there's a wrong note, and suddenly that sounds better. And, and then you're introduced to people who have maybe a blues background or a rock background, and they do it a certain way. So you pick those things up and then finally, you know, when you're at it long enough, you, you kind of understand you can allow yourself pretty much anything, but it just, there's just a long kind of, you know, for me, sort of a terrifying process of, you know, trying to get things to, I think there this old, caravan or I don't know, Hatfield in the north, or some line in one of the songs about choosing notes to see if they make friends. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kerry: </b>You know, it was that kind of, that kind of politeness about it. And, and then, then, you know, those inhibitions steadily fell away. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So it sounds like collaboration was a real influential thing on, on your musical development, and you're still really active in doing collaborations. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kerry: </b>Well, you know, it's something, it is so much easier collaborating than working on your own. And, it's just, things, you know, the ideas seem more fluent, introduced to stuff, you know, on the fly while it's happening. So yeah, I mean, there's been, it's been off and on. I mean, we did the Savant thing all those years ago, and I wouldn't care to revisit that. I mean, that was a wonderful experience, but it was just so, so much work. And then, done some things with Mark, especially lately, you know, mark and I performed about a year ago, and Greg was there for that 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>On Seattle. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kerry: </b>Yeah. That's a nice evening. And, now I can say I did that <laugh> and, bill Seaman, who I think is pretty well known, from Duke, he, he approached me about a year ago and, and we got into a project that became very intense and very informative for me. And, it'll actually be out, I think early next year. It's a, it's a double album. I mean, there was so much material and all of it was so kind of seemingly profound anyway, that we, we decided a two records set would be the best way to go. And yeah, all these individuals bring something very different to the process and to my understanding. And, you know, and hopefully I bring something other than frustration to <laugh> to their experience, but <laugh>. But, yeah, it's, it's especially easy now compared to tape and microphones and right kits and amps and all that, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1410.955" data-end_ts="1411.245" title="1410.955" id=c_"1410.955">__that__</span>, yeah, it's very fluent. Very, very fluid too. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right now, generally, when I talk to people, I like to avoid too much gear talk, because there's a lot of places people get, get into gear talk. But in your case, I want to touch into it a little bit because because of your long history of musical production, you have actually floated in and out of a lot of, not only of a lot of recording gear and, you know, you talk about sort of like enjoying the process of doing it all, but also a lot of instruments and a lot of different kinds of instruments. So you would've, you know, working in the late seventies and early eighties, you've been, would've been working with some of the, you know, late model <span style="color:red" data-ts="1458.465" data-end_ts="1458.685" title="1458.465" id=c_"1458.465">__mug__</span> stuff and, and, a lot of analog gear. Did you ever get much into modular stuff at that time? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kerry: </b>You know, it, it was always difficult for me. I had some Ober Oberheim modules, and I always struggled with those compared to like Moog and Sequential circuits. So, you know, it was, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1478.785" data-end_ts="1479.005" title="1478.785" id=c_"1478.785">__and__</span> I, I might've again been polluted by, another friend of mine at the time, but there was a, there was a really awful company called paa. I dunno if you Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kerry: </b>Oh 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. <laugh>, everyone has scars from, everyone from back then had scars from paa. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kerry: </b>Yeah. And, you know, he dutifully soldered all this stuff together, and then we tried to, you know, patch it and make sounds with it, and it just kind of soured me on the whole idea. Right. So yeah, I, I, I had, I, I had a very deep affection for my mini mug. I, I started with a micro <span style="color:red" data-ts="1510.425" data-end_ts="1510.645" title="1510.425" id=c_"1510.425">__mug__</span>, Uhhuh <affirmative>. I really, really liked the memory mug, which I don't think is a very well regarded instrument, but I used that quite a lot in the early eighties. Interesting. And, we had a, a profit five, and I think one of the first pieces of digital gear that I truly enjoyed was <span style="color:red" data-ts="1528.725" data-end_ts="1528.845" title="1528.725" id=c_"1528.725">__a__</span>, the early lexicon pulse code stuff. I think PCM 41, 41 42 was a great deal of fun to play with that. And those, of course, all of that is a completely different experience from digital stuff between that period. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kerry: </b>And, and today, I, I had a few Kurt's viles and I, I just really, I, I couldn't comprehend them at all. I, I just struggled mightily with those synthesizers and, really didn't have any of the sense of, you know, discovery and enjoyment that I had with the MOG stuff. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1562.505" data-end_ts="1562.725" title="1562.505" id=c_"1562.505">__See__</span>, and now, you know, I mean, well, I'm, I'm trying to, you know, install an instrument now. So there're <laugh>, there are upsides and downsides to all this stuff. The sampling instruments can be pretty impressive, but they're a little cumbersome. And I've been using a few, modeling synthesizers, which seem kind of nice. Like 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What? Like 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kerry: </b>What? But it's, oh, the a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1584.165" data-end_ts="1584.285" title="1584.165" id=c_"1584.165">__a__</span> s stuff like <span style="color:red" data-ts="1585.685" data-end_ts="1586.045" title="1585.685" id=c_"1585.685">__<inaudible>__</span>. But, you know, I I, I tend to now I tend to kind of be less interested in the source itself and much more interested in what is offered in terms of processing and reinterpreting what it does then, what it just wants to do on its own. So, you know, drop from samples, electric, electronic, modeling instruments, just, you know, pretty much anything that provides a reasonable starting point. And then try to get a, as far away from the instrument if possible. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Yeah. One of, one of the things I'm curious about, because I know it, it affects me to this day, and I mean, my first instruments were, a micro, 2,600, which I used in school and, stuff like that. And there was this immediacy to the sound because there was kind of like one knob per function. And, there was some focus in terms of saying, once I learned this interface, I can really learn to do my own sound design. And then, came along the digital sense and all of a sudden you had one data dial and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1662.595" data-end_ts="1662.885" title="1662.595" id=c_"1662.595">__kind__</span> of, well <span style="color:red" data-ts="1663.805" data-end_ts="1663.965" title="1663.805" id=c_"1663.805">__crisp__</span>, right? Yeah. Right. Well, and, and a lot of them at that time. Right. And, now with software instruments, there's ways to get sort of physical control of it, but the complexity of some of them even surpasses the complexity of the Kurzweil. What do you do to kind of, mitigate the issues with instrumental complexity? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kerry: </b>Well, I, I think that's an excellent point because, you know, to put it in, in a layman's sort of term, at least from my perception of these things, is that the possibility, the possibilities that are available to the programmers that develop this stuff are obviously quite enormous. And I, I get the sense that from a marketing perspective, it's always better for these guys to say, well, I've got 52 million permutations <laugh>, and my competitor only has 51,000,920, you know, <laugh> and like that, that, that additional load of stuff there is supposed to somehow make it more worthwhile. So I, I, I think we're kind of, drowning in choice. And, and I don't know that the choices are all that significant that it gets back to what I was saying just a minute ago, which is, you know, trying to get away from the instrument as much as possible. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kerry: </b>Right. Because even once you have some kind of audio or output from whatever source you're using, it doesn't really have to reside with the instrument any longer. There are many, many processing and manipulation tools that I find to be more akin to what you described with your experience of, with the art than I find with the experience of the virtual instrument. So, sure. So I, I tend to look at them as just a source, and I then I tend to go through, you know, a fairly, you know, arbitrary process of finding combinations of methods for processing and cutting it up that make it more interesting, at least for me. But yeah, it's just too, there was an immediacy, to those instruments and the fact that if I turn this a certain way or turn that a certain way, I'm gonna get a certain result versus, you know, the memorization stuff that you have to go through, with some of the products today that, is very different. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kerry: </b>And I know there are people, well, I think when, you know, when I worked with Bill Seaman on, on this, this record that we have coming out, I believe he's very much in that camp. He is very much in the programming camp, and Right. He's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1816.045" data-end_ts="1816.325" title="1816.045" id=c_"1816.045">__<inaudible>__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1816.325" data-end_ts="1816.485" title="1816.325" id=c_"1816.325">__that__</span> environment and he manipulates that with an extreme deafness, and it just isn't as suitable for my, my understanding of this work. So, so yeah, I tend to kind of backpedal into some techniques that I've always used and update them, with the technology available today. And, and again, just look at the instruments pretty much the way I used to anyway, but look at them as a, as a source and look at them somewhat dispassionately and say, well, that isn't exactly the way I want that to sound, or that isn't doing what I want it to do, but, but maybe that's not the worst thing in the world. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's kind of interesting because that seems like a thread that goes all the way back to the little reel to reel too, that you sort of like grabbing something and then manipulating it once you had it on tape. I mean, it sounds like you've brought that conceptually forward to whatever systems you're using now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kerry: </b>Right? Yeah, I mean, I I I, I'm sorry to admit that for all these years I haven't come up with that many new ideas. It's just, there's some things that work. I was, I was sort of, brought up a, a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1881.725" data-end_ts="1881.965" title="1881.725" id=c_"1881.725">__data__</span>, you know, so Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, the ready made has always had an enormous appeal. I've also had an attitude towards the work that is more, let's say tilts more towards accepting what happens rather than trying to overly direct what happens. Right. So more alien. And, and that's just how I am, and that's how I approach it, and that's my level of understanding. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I think it's interesting though that, that you say that because I mean, I can really appreciate that perspective, but it's hard for me to embrace it, at least for myself. And the reason is, is because I, I can be very accepting of what happens and expansive with what happens when I'm doing like a live performance. But there's something about the recorded work that seems like, I don't know, and maybe it's just the devil on my shoulder speaking into my ear telling me that this is for posterity. You must obsess, you must 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kerry: </b>Know. Yeah. But you know, I mean, pos posterity is pretty malleable, isn't it? <laugh>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1946.565" data-end_ts="1946.605" title="1946.565" id=c_"1946.565">__I__</span> mean, first of all, you know, the judgment will lie with the listener. And the listener will bring <span style="color:red" data-ts="1953.445" data-end_ts="1953.565" title="1953.445" id=c_"1953.445">__a__</span>, a number of considerations and context to it that you yourself do not. And I guess I came to the, the conclusion that it isn't so much that any one of these will do just fine, kind of an attitude, but it is just that there isn't going to be that one fixed optimal point to anything that we do that will be so far superior to other possible outcomes. And that has tended for me to put the emphasis more on just doing this and, and, and keeping a stream of this active than just fixating on an artifact that's somewhere at the end of that. And part of that for me too, is, you know, I very much suffered or, or felt the way you do about it, but I could never, never in my, in my life, whether it was in design work or in audio work, I could never get it to be the conception. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kerry: </b>Right. I could never get it to be the thing that was imagined. And that's, you know, you do that long enough and that gets to be very hurtful. And you either, I would either now become, you know, the victim of some psychosis, or I would have to learn to start to accept the fact that the point of conception will not be the point of completion. And, and that that's gonna have to do, and that the answer for me was to just to continue to work and to fail here or to succeed a bit there, but stick with the notion of it as process rather than product. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. So, other people I know that kind of take a process oriented view of their work tend to produce massive amounts of work out of which they <span style="color:red" data-ts="2058.195" data-end_ts="2058.485" title="2058.195" id=c_"2058.195">__call__</span> a very, small amount that they present to others. Is that, is that how you work? Or do you have a tendency to take a thing and mold it into, into shape? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kerry: </b>Well, that, that is exactly how I work. Quantity yields quality, I guess is the idea. And, you know, you mentioned the Pale Catalog, before that there was the gray catalog and, and the gray catalog was about 12 or 16 pieces out of like 40 Uhhuh <affirmative>. And, and then out of that remainder, there were still a few things that were interesting, but they were too much like what had been in the Gray catalog. So I went to Bill and I said, I think these are kind of worthwhile. Why don't you manipulate these and make them more abstract or, you know, make them different? And, so that was also outta that big call. So yeah, there's, yeah, there's just a lot of work and, and a lot of it, when you're as process oriented as I am, just doesn't come to anything Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kerry: </b>And <laugh> and, and some do, and yeah. Then it becomes an editing sort of process. And I, I guess you could even take the things that you feel are good enough and go back and refine them further. And occasionally I do that, but quite honestly, the process gets to be so, thorny that, that sometimes going back, even in earlier digital iterations of the thing you're doing, it gets to be almost counterproductive. At least for me. I mean, at that point, I think you need some objectivity, and that was why, for example, with the Pale Catalog, that finishing step went to someone else entirely. Right, right. So that I, there wasn't this burden of preconception or expectation. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That's, that's really interesting. Now, when I listen to your work, it seems to me, I, I'm gonna make some guesses, but it seems to me like you are a big fan of like looper systems and delay systems. How much is that true, and how much of that is post-processing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kerry: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2184.435" data-end_ts="2184.725" title="2184.435" id=c_"2184.435">__Well__</span>, I think <span style="color:red" data-ts="2185.385" data-end_ts="2185.605" title="2185.385" id=c_"2185.385">__in__</span> most of the cases that would be post for me because, I would tend to, I would tend to either do that as a function of editing, or the only time it really occurs early on is when we do these sorts of, well, for example, you know, within a, a mini framework, I would take, unrelated intervals for, you know, related duration and pitch kinds of things and repeat them out for like eight hours and then section them down into little parts just to see how the patterns overlap and stretch and bend and, and contract. I see. So, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2223.965" data-end_ts="2224.085" title="2223.965" id=c_"2223.965">__I__</span>, I think the loops aren't, aren't as rigid as the word implies. I mean Okay. 'cause they're mostly non synchronous, and I just became sort of a fan of non synchronous stuff like that because the accidents can be so, so lovely. You know what I mean? Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I agree. One of the things that I, I've actually done some live looping performances. It took a while to actually find a looper, you know, other than having just a whole bunch of individual looping devices Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> to find one that could do, unsynchronized loops, because they're all really focused on like, you know, somebody Right. Playing the, the bass and then, you know, playing the guitar or whatever. I don't even know how most looper people do their thing. I just know how I do it. And for me, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2270.105" data-end_ts="2270.325" title="2270.105" id=c_"2270.105">__the__</span>, those happy accidents and the crazy new harmonic, changes and stuff that can occur are just stunning. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kerry: </b>Yeah, absolutely. And I think, you know, honestly, we were talking about collaboration earlier. I think when you go to something like that, that is asynchronous, it is a form of collaboration. You're not necessarily collaborating with an individual, but you're collaborating with a set of conditions that are gonna have quite a bit to say about what happens. Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2298.345" data-end_ts="2298.565" title="2298.345" id=c_"2298.345">__And__</span>, and I've never really been able to do the math <span style="color:red" data-ts="2300.595" data-end_ts="2301.085" title="2300.595" id=c_"2300.595">__upfront__</span> to presuppose what those things might be. I assume that's possible, but it isn't something that I do or can do <laugh>. So yeah, when you, when you create a, a process that will allow multiple to you unpredicted accidents, well, I just feel very happy in that environment. That's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. I, I agree completely. So, oftentimes when I talk to artists, I will ask them what is the instrument that they love most or most define them. But you've actually talked very specifically about trying to move away from the instrument. What is, so then let's expand that question a little further and say, what is the thing that is most beloved or most used in your, your music? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kerry: </b>Well, I, I think everything that I do, especially recently, and that would be for the last five or 10 years, would be timber based. I, I think just back to this very simple love of the sound itself, you know, free of musical preoccupation. And I say that with, with some trepidation because we, we've talked earlier about, at least in my opinion, any sort of noise or music, or excuse me, noise or sound should be considered available to music. Right. But, you know, musical considerations in the more typical sense of, you know, some structure or framework or context that people comprehend as a song or, or, you know, Fantasia, whatever it might be. But, I think it just gets to be more and more of a, a timbral kind of an interest for me. And the way, that those things start to become juxtaposed and affect one another in unpredicted ways. I, I just, I just feel very receptive to and appreciative of that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So you're basically saying the thing that you love is sound. Yep. <laugh>. Awesome. So, one more question, and this is sort of like the Darwin curiosity thing, since we've never met, everything between us has been virtual to this point. You probably don't know. I live in, Colorado. I live at the top of a, Rocky Mountain Ridge, and it's a very isolated place, and I love it, although I sometimes miss having access to a lot of collaborators and stuff like that. You live in Hawaii, correct? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kerry: </b>I do, yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And which 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kerry: </b>I, I live, the 2000 foot level of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2460.135" data-end_ts="2460.485" title="2460.135" id=c_"2460.135">__Holly__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2460.655" data-end_ts="2461.005" title="2460.655" id=c_"2460.655">__Acala__</span>, another mountain, a volcano. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2463.555" data-end_ts="2463.845" title="2463.555" id=c_"2463.555">__Well__</span>, there you go. Doorman one. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And so and 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kerry: </b>So, yeah, so I, I, I do appreciate the isolation and I do appreciate the fact that sometimes it's hard because you give up that kind of contact and that kind of stimulus. So yeah, sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>How do you cope? How do you cope with that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kerry: </b>Well, I lived in a city for most of my life, and I, I just, they, they can be wonderful things, but they are, you know, in an objective sense, also rather stupid <laugh>. And I, I just had enough of it, you know, I just, so, so this has been, a recovery process for me. I, I think, you know, for my, the balance of my life, I will consider myself to be in recovery from everything that is demanded of us in urban and professional environments that, probably to one percentage or another great on us and make us do things we don't want to do and make us behave ways we're not interested in behaving. So, yeah, I, I just consider myself to be in recovery and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2523.965" data-end_ts="2524.085" title="2523.965" id=c_"2523.965">__I__</span>, you know, I, I get to get on a plane now and again and go to places, but those places now are usually urban environments and they're usually for the vacation or for the change instead of the daily grind. Right. And those usually end up being, you know, like London or, or Venice or Florence or Paris or somewhere where, you know, I don't quite have to see a billboard for Rush Limbaugh or somebody else. So. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Nice. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, I hear <span style="color:red" data-ts="2551.405" data-end_ts="2551.565" title="2551.405" id=c_"2551.405">__ya__</span>. Well, the other thing I feel like is there's, when you live away, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2555.825" data-end_ts="2556.045" title="2555.825" id=c_"2555.825">__it__</span>, living in the city sort of has its rote nature. You kind of go through, you <span style="color:red" data-ts="2560.205" data-end_ts="2560.365" title="2560.205" id=c_"2560.205">__kind__</span> become a part of a big machine, and so like that when you live in a more isolated condition, you end up having to live a more deliberate life. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kerry: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And as a result, I, I think it can either be, I mean, it's funny because up here, every year a few houses sell, new people come in and about half those people move out within a year because they're uncomfortable with having to be that determined about how they live their thing. But I think that having to live a deliberate life, especially for an artist, kind of opens the door for some interesting things. You talked about having, about making music as sort of a practice, as sort of a thing you do. And the way you talk about it is almost like it's a meditative type of thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kerry: </b>It's, it, it, it is, except it's not incredibly tranquil a lot of the time. You know, there, there's a lot of, again, it's back to the, the earlier topic about expectations being perpetually dashed by Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Reality 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kerry: </b>Being whatever we are. But well, but the thing that has become overriding important to me here, and I think the thing that does also, it happens here as well is the isolation is, you know, people struggle to make this place like everywhere else, and it just doesn't want to be, and it's not gonna be Right. Right. And so they end up leaving as well. But the thing that is so profoundly lovely here is the quiet. I mean, it is, there is genuine quiet, and, it's that kind of quiet where you can stand outside at in the evening and hear your nervous system. You know, it's Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> that quiet. And I, I came, I came to be addicted to that pretty quickly, and it was something that I just didn't have in Seattle or anywhere else I'd lived. There's never quiet. Some people like that, and some people go crazy. So, but it does, yeah, it does have help to then approach this as a form of practice rather than as a form of, you know, occupation. Right. And I, I just feel comfortable doing it, thinking of it that way, and approaching it that way. And, and, this is a very nice, quiet place to do that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's fantastic. Well, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2706.165" data-end_ts="2706.405" title="2706.165" id=c_"2706.165">__Carrie__</span>, I want <span style="color:red" data-ts="2706.885" data-end_ts="2706.925" title="2706.885" id=c_"2706.885">__to__</span> thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us.

<p>

</p>

<b>Kerry: </b>Well, I appreciate being asked some questions. It's great to speak to people that, you know, have a shared interest. I think we all come at this stuff differently, but we all want some very, very, very similar and unique outcomes from the listening and the music experience. And, you know, I think the most important thing is of course, we just don't treat it like another object to keep us distracted and rattling in the background so we don't get to face what's really going on with our days and our lives. Right,

It was really super fascinating and I really enjoyed this interview is one of the finest that we've done. I also want to take this opportunity to thank a few more people that were involved in the Kickstarter program. This week was the first week I was able to do a backup recording on the, H two N. Luckily, I didn't need it, but it was really great to have that in <span style="color:red" data-ts="2808.865" data-end_ts="2808.945" title="2808.865" id=c_"2808.865">__your__</span> pocket just in case.
