<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today I have the great pleasure of, getting a chance to talk to a friend of mine. His name's Jesse Terry We first got to know each other when I was in Berlin for a visit to Ableton. He was there, about to move to Berlin, if I recall right. And, he spent some time out there. He is since come back to the States. He is the man behind most of the controllers that we've all grown to love. He's, I, I don't know. I'll, I'll let you describe your position, but what I would say is that you've been in a designer role with, an awful lot of hardware. So with that, Jesse, how are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse Terry: </b>I'm doing great. Thanks, Darwin 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Why don't you start off by explaining, exactly what your role is and some of the things that you've worked on. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>Sure. So, I am the, I'm the product owner for hardware at Ableton. And, I think, some of the things I've worked on in the past is I worked, on the <span style="color:red" data-ts="78.845" data-end_ts="78.965" title="78.845" id=c_"78.845">__A__</span> PC 40. That was the first hardware project I worked on, along with the guys at a <span style="color:red" data-ts="83.725" data-end_ts="83.925" title="83.725" id=c_"83.725">__Kai__</span> and, specifically Glen Darcy, who's now at Arturia. And, then from there I worked on Ableton Push and, and now more recently push two. And, yeah, it was a winding road to get to the place to work on those projects, but it's been a lot of fun and it's, it's also my passion and my free time to use those things. Yeah, it's, it's a, it's a dream job in many ways. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. So, I'm kind of curious, one of the things I like doing is kind of diving into people's background. And I know that you have, you have a background as a player and a musician, and I'm kind of curious how you bring that forward and end up becoming a product. The product owner has a big role in the design creation, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>Sure. I'm, I work as a, as both a, a product owner, sort of prioritizing what kind of, what kind of features go into it and defining the vision of a product. And then I'm also interested in the small details of it. So I do design a lot of the, some of the smaller features of the products and work with a team of designers to, to figure out exactly how it's all gonna work. Got it. And, I think for me, a big part of it is, so I'm, I'm a musician by training. I played guitar all my life, and, that led me into, from playing in rock and metal in high school to learning and studying jazz for a while. And, and getting into electronic music and hip hop. And, and for my education, I studied classical composition. I see. Which pretty much never came in useful to me at all until, designing the, the, grid of push and the layout for how you can play notes and melodies there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>Sure. <span style="color:red" data-ts="195.575" data-end_ts="195.925" title="195.575" id=c_"195.575">__Right__</span>. And, yeah, I think, I think it's like, I studied it so you don't have to in some ways <laugh>. But, I guess, I mean, I guess, yeah, it was a, I I think that the most, interesting part for me is, is getting into the details of Guitar and Harmony. That's the stuff that really got me into it, early on. And then since, you know, in the last, I guess 15 years, it's been more of a transition over to making music with computers and, and drum machines and synthesizers and that sort of stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So I'm, I'm kind of actually interested because that sounds like an <span style="color:red" data-ts="232.265" data-end_ts="232.485" title="232.265" id=c_"232.265">__arc__</span> kind of similar to mine. What, first of all, what was it that propelled you from heavy metal and rock into jazz? Was it the difficulty of it? Was it the more depth to harmony and stuff? Or was it a particular player that caught your attention? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>Y you know, I like, I guess around like around age 12, I was into more of the like, hardcore and punk areas of rock, and something got me into probably like the early Metallica albums got me into like shredding and I was a terrible shredder in all the worst kind of ways. Mullets and, you know, shaved sides and back of the head steinberger guitars, all these really, awful directions. And I think, you know, I mean, through that I, I always had a love of Hendrix and things like that, but then I guess it was West Montgomery probably that got me and <span style="color:red" data-ts="286.005" data-end_ts="286.205" title="286.005" id=c_"286.005">__Greg__</span> Green. And, and this stuff I think also changed the way I was, you know, I was into hip hop all that time too, so sort of hearing the, like, how the samples of one, one of these measures of a, of a jazz album can turn into a, a hip hop track. That all got me very interested in as well. So like, in collecting jazz. And I still listen to a lot of jazz, not so much metal, right. <laugh>. But, but, you know, and through that, I guess through hip hop, got into electronic music as well and, and became a music reviewer. Actually, that was my job for quite a while, was reviewing all kinds of music. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Who are you reviewing for? I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>Reviewing for, some dead internet companies. And, then for some magazines like, accelerator Magazine. Oh yeah. Right. And I became, I became their, technology editor for a while. And that, that sort of led me to Ableton. I started to review gear, and I think it was Ableton Live two. And I wrote some, nice complimentary reviews, and that caught the ears of some people at Ableton. And, so I started a relationship with them and, and moved from San Francisco out to New York to join, Dave Hill, who I guess you had on your show, right? <span style="color:red" data-ts="359.765" data-end_ts="359.885" title="359.765" id=c_"359.765">__Yeah__</span>. Not 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Too long ago. Not too long ago. That's right. So, I'm curious about, about that kind of transition. So what is it, first of all, that swung the door open for you to be able to do a review, have a redu review job? Was it just when there was all kinds of online companies and they were looking for anyone? Or did you have a specific, specific in on it? Or did you have some writing chops that you needed to exercise? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>I think I thought I had writing chops <laugh>. And, I mean, you know, I think that was, that's part of the, the promise of a liberal arts education as you become good at writing. And, you know, I could write Okay. But, but my editors there, and that was listen.com, which I guess got Oh, sure. Turned into real, networks and other things along the way. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, and also I had cnet I wrote there for a while. Oh, okay. And they had kind of a farm of, people writing 30, 30 word reviews of different artists every day. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Wow. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>And I had some very patient editors who, who showed me maybe I wasn't as good of a writer as I thought I was in kind and gentle ways. And they, they did hone my writing to a better place, I think. And then really, accelerator really helped me a lot too. Yeah. With a great editor there. So it's always these great editors. And then, you know, books like, on writing is another, is a great one Yes. To sort of get your writing to a place where you write, as few words as possible. You sort of take a hemmingway approach to, writing a clearer version of what you thought you were writing. I think. So the, the musical part was, wasn't really a problem. I feel like I always was obsessed with records and bought hundreds of CDs and records and cassettes along the way. And so like learning about the connections between, you know, what players played on which albums and all this stuff, and hearing people's tones and, and how those all related. That part I was confident in. But the writing took a little while to get together, I think. And Sure. It's a great editor that can make you into a better writer, I think. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's interesting. You kind of came on Ableton's Radar based on a, on review of Ableton Live. Do you remember what version that was? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>Yeah, I think it was Live Two Uhhuh and, or maybe Live Three, no, it was Live three is live four is when MIDI came. Yeah. So it was definitely one of those two. And I think, I, I was using it at the time and trying to piece it together with, at the time I was trying to use Live as My Only Doll, which is kind of a lot to ask of Live at that point in time. Right. 'cause it didn't have things like midi. Right. And I was using, using it rewired with, with Reason as my virtual instruments. Okay. And doing all, doing all this complicated stuff to get it to sync to my drummer on stage. And, you know, like, oh my God, playing, I had a MIDI guitar and all these things that really can cause you problems when you're playing in a live environment, I think. Right. And I just remember I had all this working live's. Tempo is following the drummers, all these things are going, and then the input Jack on my guitar, failed on my strap. So, you know, like the, the least, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Low Tech comes, low Tech comes to rescue. Huh. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>So I had to play mid guitar through the rest of the show, you know, and that was a Oh wow. The last time I did that kind of thing, I guess. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's funny. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>Yeah. So I think, you know, that got me into a place at Ableton where I was, I began sort of demoing at NAMM and, you know, wearing a headset and, and, and showing off the features of Live Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And through there, you know, I wrote quite a bit. I, ended up doing a lot of jobs as it was a smaller company back then, so like editing, I, I edited all the live six movies myself and, you know, shot them all. And I did a lot of artist movies back then. So, and thankfully our quality of our movies and artist relations has, gotten much better since my days early on <laugh>, I think it was the, the spinning head of Robert Heka in one of the videos that I snuck in that probably, ended my time as the editor 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sealed your fate, huh? Yeah, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>But, I, you know, for a while I was the artist relations manager, Uhhuh and, and business development manager. So when you see live light coming with a keyboard or, a MIDI controller, that was my job for a long time, was making those deals. Sure. And, and that I think was, that got me into the APC 40, role. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> because I worked closely with a <span style="color:red" data-ts="642.765" data-end_ts="642.925" title="642.765" id=c_"642.765">__Kai__</span> Professional. And, and yeah, that kind of was a turning point for me, I think was when Glen Darcy sort of came to us and said, Hey, here's an idea for an APC 40, we, we have to do this together. And we sort of looked at it and said, yeah, we need to do that together. And, there were some ideas we had and some ideas they had, and we sort of merged these together into something that I think was quite successful product and fulfill a need for a lot of people for a long time. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Yeah. Frankly, I still use a, well now I, now it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="677.965" data-end_ts="678.085" title="677.965" id=c_"677.965">__a__</span>, a C 20 is one of the controllers I use. I just got used to that, that particular control surface. And it's really hard for me to think of mixing in, in Ableton without that. You know, I use the push for playing and I use that for mixing. It's kind of a cool combo. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="695.325" data-end_ts="695.445" title="695.325" id=c_"695.325">__I__</span>, I mean, I have, yeah, I have both here as well. Uhhuh, <affirmative>, and, yeah, they, they fulfill different needs. Right. For sure. And, and, you know, I mean, the Fader having dedicated faders and all this stuff is really, it's great in combination with, you know, I think of push as like the, it's, it's the single track, way of thinking. You know, you're focused on what's happening in that track. And the APC 40 is like, how do you get to all your different ideas and launch them? And certainly for stage it's useful to have all that dedicated control 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Through the relationships you developed is as sort of like doing the bundling packages. It's kinda interesting how within the MI industry, how, how important are those relationships do you think? Did, do you find that that was something that opened doors for you a lot? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>Yeah, I do because, it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="747.725" data-end_ts="747.845" title="747.725" id=c_"747.725">__a__</span>, it's a, it's a small industry that we work in and there's a lot of turnover and the people you talk with at one company, you know, I guess you, you should always treat everybody nice. 'cause they might show up at a different company next. And, and yeah, I think we, you know, we have, we've had, you know, there's painful negotiations and, happy results and not so happy results. And in that way you kind of become, you become close to these people that you work with. And, and I think, in particular, in many ways I was a, you know, because I was in the US and American and working with some American companies, I think it helped to have me as sort of a middle person to have the relationship between a German company and some of these American companies where the cultures are frankly, quite different actually. And, you know, I helped to translate that. And I think, I've tried to, you know, be honest with everybody we work with and, you know, try to work on the end result and get to a good product together. And I, I think that worked out well. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So I <span style="color:red" data-ts="818.765" data-end_ts="818.925" title="818.765" id=c_"818.765">__wanna__</span> talk a little bit about the development of the push. I am, I am a little fascinated by the push, because to me, I mean, I guess in retrospect, if you look at it, it probably was a natural evolution, but at the time it seemed revolutionary to me the way that, that the, you know, sort of a, a, a machine that was really purpose built to be an extension of the software. Right. I, I found it to be very different from the A PC in the way I approached it as an interface, as a controller. And I think a lot of people did. Right. It, it kind of took the world by storm. You start seeing 'em everywhere. Tell me a little bit about, first of all, how you, how you made the decision you did to move in that direction, but also what were like the overriding values you were looking for when you were trying to make something like this? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>So I think it started out as a, you know, I guess I come from like the MPC 2000 early on, and a lot of drum machines and that sort of thing. And, you know, make hip hop. And so there's, there's a workflows that I was coming with and artists I was talking to. And, and for me, I was like, I want something to, to really make my drum beats and sample and work with samples and make all this part easier to do with live and less, you know, clicking around with the mouse and more, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="905.275" data-end_ts="905.565" title="905.275" id=c_"905.275">__have__</span> fun way to make beats the way it was with many of these drum machines. And we started in this direction and really like, worked into the ideas that, you know, of sort of combining the fun of playing drums and, and step sequencing drums and being able to quickly do all this stuff without, you know, a lot of steps and without going to your computer a lot. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>And this was all, I think, going pretty well. And, and Gerhard came to me and said, you know what? This shouldn't just be for beats though. This should be for everything. It's sort of one of these, commandments you get from your, from your boss. Like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="942.385" data-end_ts="942.605" title="942.385" id=c_"942.385">__ah__</span>, man. And it's the worst when he is right <laugh>, which he, he often is <laugh>. And so sort of like, well, but we have this idea, we could just do this. And he's like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="953.985" data-end_ts="954.205" title="953.985" id=c_"953.985">__no__</span>, let's, let's just make it for everything. And, so Melody and Harmony were added to the mix, which for me is a, was a really fun challenge. And as I said before, this is like, oh, <span style="color:red" data-ts="965.965" data-end_ts="966.085" title="965.965" id=c_"965.965">__I__</span>, well, I do have a degree in music theory, so maybe I can make some use of this. And I think, just getting to the idea of, of quick ways to come up with music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>I, I mean, I don't think, like push will never replace a piano for a person who's studied piano. I mean, it's just not, it's not what it's for, I think. Right. You can start on it and you can get to a place where you can play with that kind of virtuosity, but, you know, for, it's not, it's not meaning to replace any of these other instruments, but what it can do is give you a quick way to get a great musical ideas down. And, and this kind of came through trial and error. I mean, I think we, we for sure looked at other, at plenty of other instruments. I mean, I think even like for Gerhard, I think his inspiration came from a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1014.745" data-end_ts="1015.355" title="1014.745" id=c_"1014.745">__bandoneon__</span> that he saw playing on the street, and he is like, how does this thing work with all these, these buttons in this grid? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>And, you know, we looked at everything from hexagonal buttons to, to all different orderings. And, and this is like really fun work to do, to go and investigate how other instruments work and these sort of, these, strange equal temperament, or odd temperament, pianos that are out there and yeah. And all this stuff. And somehow through all this, there was at some point a eureka moment of just like, of the way coming up with the layout, the way that Bush has it now, then it was just sort of like tweaking it and, and trying to figure out which scales to add and all this stuff, which was just fun and, and challenging on the development side, I think to make it all as fast and as fluid as it is, there's certainly a lot of, a lot of influence from all kinds of other, drum machines and step sequencers and the mono and, and, everything that people were hacking with the APC 40 as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>And this all came together and it, you know, I mean, then it was about sort of figuring out how we move, how big the buttons were and how where we move the buttons around. And I think there's some pictures on the internet you can find of our, our prototype of push one, which <span style="color:red" data-ts="1093.195" data-end_ts="1093.395" title="1093.195" id=c_"1093.195">__was__</span> a, hacked together with, we <span style="color:red" data-ts="1097.035" data-end_ts="1097.195" title="1097.035" id=c_"1097.035">__used__</span> some of this, this livid kit of buttons that you can get the livid builder and glued these two Legos. And then, basically we're able to move all the buttons around until we found something that we liked. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>And, I have an account at the custom Lego ordering, place where like Lego has this awesome, you can order Legos in any color and size and, and, yeah, those expense reports were a little tricky to justify <laugh>. And, also hearing my, my wife hearing me like digging through the Lego bin is like, are you, are you really working up there? Right, yeah. Or, a lot of trial and error. And then, you know, you do everything exactly the way you want. And after push one we're like, ah, but we should have had a button here. And Oh, this is, ah, this one is a little bit, you know, you learn these things as you watch users. And Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I wanted to actually, I wanted to actually ask you about that because we had, you and I had an interesting conversation, a while after the push came out where you were asking me about my use, and I was even sort of like bemoaning some things that I do from, you know, because I think it's gonna work away and it doesn't, and it kind of freaks me out and stuff like this. Right. And you were, you were actually very patient with me letting, letting me sort of like flail my arms. And then later I was thinking about it and I was like, oh my God, you probably spent years of your life designing it exactly the way it was. And here I am, like mulling about the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1187.165" data-end_ts="1187.515" title="1187.165" id=c_"1187.165">__arrow__</span> doesn't seem to do what I want. How, how frustrating is it to have to first of all come up with an idea that's gonna be sealed in hardware? And secondly then having to hear people complain about it or app praise it. I mean, it's gotta be nice to get praised for it too. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>It's a little of all those things. And if I say the word, button layout, like we literally had meeting, titles that were like revenge of the button layout and the button layout strikes back. 'cause that, that moment of, of like, this is it. That's it. There's nothing more you can do. And well, we could change, we could change the silk screening on the buttons that gives us another two months. And it's kinda like you want you, it's almost better when you make the decision because you just live with it and you can move forward. But I mean, it's never perfect and you always, first <span style="color:red" data-ts="1242.515" data-end_ts="1242.735" title="1242.515" id=c_"1242.515">__you__</span> don't satisfy everyone. So we really have to, to create, an idea of who we're targeting and, and live with that, and know that there's gonna be people who are outside of that who it's not perfect for. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>But then we watch users just nonstop. I mean, we're always listening and we watch big artists. We watch unknowns, we watch 18 year olds, and we, we go and we travel and we go to their places and we see how they work. And I think there's definitely a big difference between like what somebody says and what they do. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> in many of these cases. And I think, you know, somebody can say, I wish it had a button like this and this and, and you know, we have a big picture of Homer's car from The Simpsons where he did everything for the last thing and put it up. And Yeah, I remember, we could, you know, I mean, that's part of our job is to try to simplify what people want and, and reduce it to the elements that are most necessary. And, and then there's the challenge of like, what can you do in this amount of time to get it ready for release? And for sure, there's things that we leave on the table and we're working on them. And I think we're doing a pretty good job, especially with push two of, of adding these things now so that, you know, there's still an ongoing, upgrades to it as it, as it lives and evolves, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Evolves on the business. And even the design side of it, it probably did not seem like an evolution. It probably seemed like a reinvention because first of all, Ableton's been very clear that this, unlike, unlike the push one, which was in collaboration with a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1339.225" data-end_ts="1339.445" title="1339.225" id=c_"1339.225">__Kai__</span>, this is, completely manufactured <span style="color:red" data-ts="1345.065" data-end_ts="1345.285" title="1345.065" id=c_"1345.065">__and__</span> designed and manufactured by Ableton. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And so to me, while it, it seems like you had a tough job because for it to carry the, the push name, you know, you'd already established what a push is, so you couldn't really go completely back to the drawing board, right? Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>I think, or 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Did you feel like you could've, I don't know. That's a, that's a question I guess more than a statement 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>We could've, in that we, we re-engineered it from scratch. Like there's nothing, no commonality under the hood between this and, and push one because we, we did it entirely anew. So there were some things we could do, some things we didn't want to do that we liked. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> some adjustments to things that we thought, Hey, this isn't quite the way we wanted it to work from push one. But I guess the, the main difference, overall is the, is the display, which, which leads to, I mean, the display led to so many different changes for us in terms of like the technology. Like push one is, is CSX that goes back and forth and, to power the display and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1416.265" data-end_ts="1416.425" title="1416.265" id=c_"1416.265">__send__</span> Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1417.235" data-end_ts="1417.585" title="1417.235" id=c_"1417.235">__sends__</span> characters. And this is a different technology and requires a lot more work in live and push and to run the display that we have. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>Right. That, that and the fact that because it's not a character display, we've got, we have the opportunity to use these buttons above and below the display to be labeled buttons. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Right. And that led to just a ton of functionality changes. But I mean, even, even more than that, the, to do that display, I mean, displays are, are like a cell phone run business, basically. Like <laugh>, if your display is the size of a cell phone, then you can get them for reasonable prices. 'cause you know, they're selling millions of these things. Yep. But, if you wanna display like push, it's gonna cost you. So, this is, an extremely expensive part for a company of our size to use. And I think, that that was difficult to do. I mean, I mean, to be honest, it's like, I don't know that we could do that in collaboration with another company and both make profit on it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>And I think we were upfront with, with Akai about this, they understood and Mm-Hmm, <affirmative>, and it's not just that, I think it's, I mean, they, they were awesome to work with. They really, helped us make a, we felt a home run with push one. But it's our, this is like a, such a massive portion of our, of our company of what we do that it like to put the time into it that we need to put into it. I think it needed to be done by ourselves. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, it does, it does make the point, which is, there, there are certain things, there are certain things you can ask of, of a partner, and then at some point it gets to be too much. Right. And what you don't want to do, if you're, I mean, it sounds to me like one of the things you, you all chose not to do is focus on compromise. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>Yeah, that's, that's true. I mean, in, in terms of the user that we target in terms of like the cost, the cost of components, I mean, yeah, it's a, there's things that we didn't, we didn't want to compromise on. And also the time, the time we put into each of these things, like, I think it would probably drive, or, or maybe it did, I, I should talk to the guys that I got, the, it'll drive you crazy <laugh> if, you know, the, the level of detail and obsession we take into the, each of the little, aspects of it externally, you may say, it looks pretty much like push one, but, not, not toss. I think there's many, many differences to it and nuances. It's fun to get into those details and probably a little frustrating at times. But I think there's certainly, you nailed it in terms of there's only so much you can ask a partner company of how much energy you can ask them to put into a product that isn't ultimately their product, I think. And, yeah, that's, that, that's, that went into our reasoning for making it ourselves, which led us to, to having to learn how to source parts, how to have it, how to make it, get it built, and, you know, all these and, had to expand our hardware team and stuff like this. So this is all new territory for us, but luckily we had some great people to come on board and, and a lot of people who learned new things to make this kind of thing happen. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I, I know for myself, the one time I was involved in sort of like manufacturing type stuff, it was on a much smaller scale, but even then, one of the things that we noticed was that an awful lot of manufacturing is driven by cell phone technology and cell phone manufacturing. And so as a result, if you're talking about tens or hundreds or even thousands of something, you know, you just see an eye roll on the other side because they're used to churning out millions of things. And, and so then all of a sudden that scale level gets to be a real problem in terms of sourcing parts, making sure that, suppliers will keep parts available, not end of life them too early, or even want to return your call if you're working at too small of a quantity, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>Yeah. We, we faced all those problems for sure. And, you know, just finding the right, the, a factory that was like, the right size, the right costs, treated their workers the right way. You know, I think finding all these things, you know, we had quite a checklist of what we wanted. It's like a, a Goldilocks, situation. 'cause if you're too small for the company, then you get overlooked by them. If you're too big for them, they're not gonna be able to make your stuff in the right quantities. Right. In the right timing. And, I mean, that's been, that's been really exciting and fun actually to do <span style="color:red" data-ts="1711.125" data-end_ts="1711.325" title="1711.125" id=c_"1711.125">__the__</span>, that research. And, you know, there's, there's many people who help us to in this area too. I mean, somebody like Roger <span style="color:red" data-ts="1720.885" data-end_ts="1721.005" title="1720.885" id=c_"1720.885">__Lin__</span> has helped told me, you know, who he works with and helped me to, you know, figure out things to look for. But certainly our head of hardware Oliver is the, Oliver Harms. He's the, he's the guy who got it made, I'd say in many ways. He, in that he, you know, has knowledge of all the mechanical and electronical stuff that needs to go on and is also, also speaks Mandarin, which doesn't hurt. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Did you ever have electronics chops that you could mock stuff up? I mean, were you involved ever in the electronics side of it, or did you always stay clear of that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>No, I mean, I, with push one, I put together what we called our, our Frankenstein. So like I have enough knowledge to, to solder and, burn my fingers and, incorrectly solder and have somebody else help me figure it out. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Have you seen that? Have you seen that great T-shirt? That's like, if it smells like chicken, then you're holding it it wrong and it shows a guy holding a soldering iron <laugh>. I thought that was great. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>No, that's, that's good. I think there's, there's, some great YouTube videos that on learning to solder correctly, and I advise anybody listening who has problems with soldering to watch these, they're great. So yeah, I mean, so no, I'm, I'm not a, I don't know enough about it. I mean, I can, I can solder by numbers basically, I'd say, and have a basic understanding, but not more in terms of like, you know, I guess my job is more like in, Hey, we wanted to do this and okay, here's how much that's gonna cost, so let's look at these parts and try to figure out that kind of stuff. So, but, yeah, it's interesting to me. And, and the same way, I guess the software side is also interesting to me, but I don't really know much more than being able to poke around in a Python file a little bit. But, I have a much better chance of breaking something than, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Fixing, fixing <laugh>. Well, so I'm curious now, from your standpoint, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1851.275" data-end_ts="1851.495" title="1851.275" id=c_"1851.275">__at__</span>, at some point someone had to say, well, what if we replace the character display of the push one with a fully graphic display on the push two? I'm thinking that that represents a holy crap. We have to throw everything out the door and kind of start the whole thing from fresh, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>Yeah, I mean, it, I mean, to be honest, that was a, this was was even something we wanted before push one. You know, it just was like, it, it came into like, well, you're not gonna be able to find a display like that and, it's gonna cost too much. And, you know, and the development time is gonna be this many years Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, it looked like something that just wasn't really possible at the moment. I see. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>Okay. And we kind of, we kind of lucked into finding the right display at the right size. Like, I mean, when we found this display, we're like, wow, that's like, that's like this same exact width as the eight pads going across. That's total luck. I mean, we didn't have this custom built, we found it. Wow. So, but they're like, you know, you, how, what's the end of life of that display? Exactly. You know, like, we have, we have to deal with all these kind of issues and 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, so I'm, I'm curious then, how do you go through the process once you have like a completely new palette, right? 'cause that's what happens when you go from a character to a graphic display. Your palette changes completely. What, what is it like doing that design? I mean, was it, was it just like, well, we used to have kind of a, a graphic slider, let's do a curvy thing instead. Or how much did that, how much did the user interface and the, the human interface change once you had this new palette? I mean, I'm just, I, I'm asking all these design questions because I'm, quite frankly, I'm a little fascinated with design anyway, and especially when it comes to human computer interface stuff. And quite frankly, I think the job that you did on the push two was amazing because I noticed the existence of that display changed the way that I interface with the push. I, I find myself diving into much greater detail than I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1994.725" data-end_ts="1995.125" title="1994.725" id=c_"1994.725">__normal__</span> normally would. Because not only is it, there's something about the display <span style="color:red" data-ts="2000.125" data-end_ts="2000.285" title="2000.125" id=c_"2000.125">__and__</span> the way that it's laid out and stuff that just draws me into detail, into levels of detail. I never approached with hardware before. And so to me, that rings a great big bell that there was, there's a design, some kind of design magic that occurred here. And so I'm, I'm, I'm asking a lot of design questions 'cause I'm curious about that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>Oh, pretty easy. I just kind of threw it to <span style="color:red" data-ts="2026.725" data-end_ts="2026.845" title="2026.725" id=c_"2026.725">__get__</span> No, <laugh>, we, <laugh>, there are, there are many, many people involved in the design of, of push two and especially the display. I mean, there's, you know, I mean, we work with external design agencies and, and I guess, you know, they probably would know better as to, I, I mean, like my early drawings are, for some of the functionality, like how we want to, how where tracks are and where devices are on the display. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2059.565" data-end_ts="2059.685" title="2059.565" id=c_"2059.565">__And__</span> how you get into access more, more, levels of an, of a device, like an effect or an instrument. And so I'm sort of working on that functional side and, and, and giving these sort of gaudy illustrator files to a design agency who's looking at it and saying, no, we're not not gonna use comic sands for this <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>We're not gonna, we're not gonna do it this way. Those colors are horrible, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2082.875" data-end_ts="2083.165" title="2082.875" id=c_"2082.875">__Jess__</span>. And, and honestly, we, we had a lot of, we had a lot of battles and, and hugs and, and it took a long time to get to where we are. And in, I guess part of the way we do it is, is is try to come up with design guidelines for things we want to do. Do we, we don't want it to feel like a computer. I mean, that was a, that was a big thing for us is we wanted it to be, I mean, it accesses the same things that live does in many ways, but we don't want it to feel like something that you have to click your mouse on or, or something that feels like there's another button around the corner here that lets me get into Facebook. You know, like Right. We wanted this thing to sort of breathe on its own and the use of color and and lines and I guess probably our head of design would, would say that, I mean, one of our goals is to sort of reduce it as much as we possibly can and only add back in layers as needed to make people understand what's going on. I think. So like, you know, there's many places where you could have had like a button with shadows behind it and, things like that. <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Wood grain or something. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>Wood grain and, chrome, chrome screws on Right. In different places, but it's really not our style. And that's true. But I think, you know, and logic, the logic of how everything's laid out is partly tied to this layout of having buttons beneath and above and below the screen. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and where the encoders are. And, but yeah, we fought about, we fought about every last detail of it and, and the names of the buttons, like Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know, know, add device versus add effect. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>I'm going back to add effect now. I wish it was a effect. You know, it's like you're having all these language questions and and language and then trying it out and you argue on paper. We do. We also do like clickable, keynote mockups to show the, you know, the way you get through these different modes and Okay. How you move around and, argue and put them in front of a lot of users and sort of synthesize what those users say. I mean, that's the main thing I think that we learn. We relearn it every, couple months, is that like we can theoretically say whatever we want and argue about it, but it all changes once you put it in front of like five people. You know, and then you're like, oh. Oh. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Of course. Yeah. Right. So how do you take, when you're in the mock-up stage, how do, how do you even put stuff in front of users? How, how can that even happen? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>We, we sign a lot of people to, NDAs. So they, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2258.595" data-end_ts="2258.885" title="2258.595" id=c_"2258.595">__they__</span> non-disclosure agreements. And, and we do this, in many ways. Like, I mean like, from like a cardboard, mockup of something to a mockup that works. I think for, like, for PUSH two, we had a lot of things where we'd have a computer screen next to a push with a lot of black tape over the push one, push two was a little easier in that sense 'cause we had something with pads that worked. But Sure. I mean, push one was like this Frankenstein controller we put together that sometimes worked. And, yeah, there's a lot, a lot we do with, max for live to do, you know, emulations? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So like for push two, we have a virtual emulation we worked against for quite a while, you know, so this, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2308.615" data-end_ts="2308.965" title="2308.615" id=c_"2308.615">__there__</span>, developers could have it on their screen and press buttons that way. And I think somebody even hacked this and found it. It, that's why I can talk about it. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>But, yeah, I mean, ju and that's the challenge I think is with software you can continually evolve it, but with hardware at some point it's frozen. And that's, I guess what we, in an ideal world, you could update your hardware, the way you can update your software, but I guess we're not there quite yet. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Not yet. So do you ever find situations where now, or do you feel like there are situations where, where the software might be stymied because there's so much hardware that's already out there that implies a certain thing? Or do you feel like in the case of Ableton, that what the software does is already so well defined that you don't sweat that as much? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>I don't think I sweat it so much. But maybe that's 'cause I'm working on the hardware software, I guess. But, I sweat the software 'cause I use it so much. I think, and, and for me, I have, I don't think that our software has to be beholden to like a MIDI controller from 12 years ago, but I think there's some universals that aren't gonna change. I think we're, there's knobs and faders and buttons and keys aren't going <span style="color:red" data-ts="2390.895" data-end_ts="2391.115" title="2390.895" id=c_"2390.895">__out__</span> of style anytime soon, I guess. Right. So, I'd love to be open to new ways of, of, control and, interaction with the software. And that's all very exciting as well, you know? Yeah. I'm a student of the, the old synthesizers, you know, like we've talked about this before and, and I, there's still so much that, that all these old synths do that I love and, and also that I hate. And I think that's a big part of learning about these stuff is like, where I love fail. I love failed synthesizer companies. Actually. That's like my favorite kind to collect. What's, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What's your favorite? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>My favorite synth? Yeah. Well, and I wouldn't, I wouldn't put this in the failed department at all, but the, I love the Oberheim stuff like the expander and, and I love the, I love the Fender chroma Polaris Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, which is kind of a, there's this, this story, you know, like there's the, the ARP avatar, which kind of put ARP out of business. Right. And I have an ARP avatar. I love that. That's right in front of me. And it's a, but I find it somehow to be like, it's a very easy synthesizer to get no sound out of <laugh>. Like, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>It's easier to get no sound than it is to get a sound. And I find that to be like, I don't think that would pass through user testing these days. Right. However, man, it makes, you know, this is the chameleon bass sound and like all these other incredible sounds came from this. But, so <span style="color:red" data-ts="2477.735" data-end_ts="2477.955" title="2477.735" id=c_"2477.735">__our__</span>, the ARP avatar put ARP out of business and Fender bought them and the result of that was the chromo Polaris and the chroma. And like, I love these histories of sort of where these things went and Right. And the chroma Polaris is just bonkers. It's like, there's, there's things in there that I'm like, how did, how did they end up with this that way? But the sound is just fantastic. And I love, I think there's a place for all these different interfaces. I love having different, I mean, I think that's the fun of synths and modular gears that you can, you can, have a different interface to control similar things and come up with totally different results and that's awesome and fun. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well it's interesting that you talk about like, 'cause you make a good point. It's almost like the very last synth that a company makes is either gonna be horrible or crazy. So I think of like in Sonic and the F smo, you know, I mean talking, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>It's on my watch list, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Yeah. It's, it's bizarre man. I got a chance to mess with it and it hurt my head, but it sounded like God on the stick, it was something else. You know? So some, some of those last gasp sense really ended up being, being pretty amazing. And so it's kind of cool to think in those terms. Actually one of 'em, one of the old failed synths that I, that I really liked was the, Kauai K five M, which, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>Had <span style="color:red" data-ts="2566.725" data-end_ts="2566.845" title="2566.725" id=c_"2566.725">__a__</span>, I just sold mine. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, did you really? Yeah. Oh wow. I just thought that they had such a cool, weird sound and there was, at the time, especially, there was nothing else approaching that sound, so it was really neat to, neat to play with. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>Yeah. I, I loved that. I, I love that synth <span style="color:red" data-ts="2584.725" data-end_ts="2584.805" title="2584.725" id=c_"2584.725">__and__</span> I've used it a lot and I just found that the, the interface, oh man, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2590.425" data-end_ts="2590.645" title="2590.425" id=c_"2590.425">__it__</span>, it just made me 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>Anything that, yeah. Anything that I have to like, pick up the manual to use. Like if I haven't used it in like a month right. Then it's like, and also I think for me, for that one, that sound is really, is really an awesome sound and get, it goes in great directions, but for me, like push two made me use operator again. Yeah. In a way that I hadn't in a while. Yeah. And, and the additive synthesis possibilities on operator are just fantastic, you know, and, right. This kind of made me realize, I was like, ah, I'm not using that one so much anymore. Yeah. Maybe I should, downsize. I'm trying, I have a, a patch bay that's full at the moment and I, it's a one <span style="color:red" data-ts="2633.885" data-end_ts="2634.085" title="2633.885" id=c_"2633.885">__in__</span> one out policy right now. 'cause Yeah, I think if, if I need two patch bays, it's, it's a problem. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. You, you have to, you have to spank yourself every once in a while to keep that stuff in order. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>Yeah. It's, I mean, it is already a problem, I guess, <laugh> so I don't get into modular 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Yeah. Well, good luck with good luck. Good luck with withstanding that I, everybody I talk to that's not yet into modular. The next time I talk to him, I'm like, yeah, I in it now <laugh>, it seems to be the virus that's going around at the moment. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>Robert Henke told me he is like, I was like, are you into modular stuff? He's like, I'm not a masochist, <laugh>, but the next time I talk to him, he's, he's slowly going down that path, so. Oh, of course. I don't know. You probably probably can't talk to him anymore. I guess <laugh>, you know, he's into lasers and modular. It's just over, I guess. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, right, exactly. Well, I mean, when I saw he was going into lasers, I was like, well pretty soon he's gonna do his own family dentistry because he's literally going backwards in time. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>Totally. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well our time is pretty much up already. I can't believe it. But, before we go, I just, I'm gonna ask you something and you're probably gonna be able to <span style="color:red" data-ts="2708.045" data-end_ts="2708.165" title="2708.045" id=c_"2708.045">__say__</span>, I can't really talk about anything in specific, but, but I still want to ask you the question. What do you see for the future of hardware? I'm not necessarily talking about push like hardware or controller hardware, but hardware in general. I mean, you, as part of your job when you were doing bundling is part of your job designing this stuff. You've gotten a chance to get your hands on hardware of all sorts. I'm curious, what, where do you think, what do you think the direction, the future direction of hardware's gonna be? 'cause it seems like there's a renaissance of hardware right now anyway, but also a desire for people to be hardware focused. I'm curious to think what you think about the future. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>I mean, good question. That's exactly what I, what I think about all the time. And I, I mean, I guess we can think back to, I, I try to look backwards and forwards, you know, seeing where, where these things changed. And I think there's, there's certainly this point of like where midi changed things and where computers came into the studio and then slowly replaced the studio. And then now it seems like we're back into this area of like modular gear and analog syn <span style="color:red" data-ts="2778.545" data-end_ts="2778.765" title="2778.545" id=c_"2778.545">__are__</span> back. And, there's thing about like, I mean, I think we all had a moment with the like minority report of like, oh, well someday none of this will exist and we'll just put our fingers in the air and, wave our hands around. And, but there's that, the hand on the knob and the hand on the fader and the finger on the key. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>These are going away. I don't think, and I don't think they should. I think, I mean, there's, there's a lot the touch screens and virtual reality can give us and they will give us, and I'm sure that'll affect the way that we all interact with our studios at some point in the future. But, but I don't think that the tactile part is going away. And so I'm wondering, you know, how can we make that better? And how can we make that, evolve that into a place that's, you know, beyond where it, where it is today. I think, that's all super interesting and, you know, consumes my, my thinking in many ways. 
</p>

<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> indeed. Well, thanks Jesse, so much for taking time outta your busy schedule to talk to us. It's great getting a chance to chat with you anyway, but it's also really cool to kind of talk about all the processes that you've gone through, with everything. So thanks a lot and have a great day.
