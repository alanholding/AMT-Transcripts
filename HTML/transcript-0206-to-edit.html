<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, today I have the great pleasure of getting to speak to somebody. It's got quite a history in the music world, and, actually somebody who keeps on kind of like slipping across <span style="color:red" data-ts="22.305" data-end_ts="22.525" title="22.305" id=c_"22.305">__my__</span> transom. So it's a great opportunity to talk to him. His name's Seth Klut, and, he does so many different things. I'm gonna let him define himself. So with that, let's say hi to Seth. Hey Seth. How's it going? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Seth Cluett: </b>Hi, Darwin. I'm good. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright. Thanks so much for taking the time to have a chat with me. I really appreciate it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Seth: </b>Oh, it's my pleasure. I'm a huge fan of the program. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, well, that's great. That's good news. Why don't we start by having you, define yourself for the listeners. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Seth: </b>Oh, fun. So it's a little complicated, but I, the, lately I think the, the easiest condensation is I, I use the phrase artist, composer, performer, that seems to cover all the bases I used to, hedge about sound, art and composer versus artist and those things. And I, I just, I do both things and they happen, in sometimes together, sometimes separate, but, it makes the most sense to allow them to be themselves, at the center of it. I'm just, deeply engaged in sound broadly, but more specifically memory and attention. Space and ecology come up in the work a lot. So I try to center my practice more around the things that I'm interested in exploring through, through sound than, than necessarily the titles. But there's some, there's a lot of science in there, as well. But it's, it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="101.645" data-end_ts="101.885" title="101.645" id=c_"101.645">__very__</span> deep below the surface of the work. Informs the work, though quite a lot. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>One of the things I'm curious about, you said that, the work you do tends to focus on memory and attention and ecology. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> what do you mean by ecology? Exactly? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Seth: </b>So I grew up very rural in upstate New York, maybe 20 miles east, Troy 20 miles west of Williamstown, 20 miles south of Bennington. And, I first went to college, I did my undergraduate at New England Conservatory Music in Boston. And, I went from this seven towns across 40 miles in one high school with a graduating class of 90 students to going to, you know, a freshman class of 90 students at conservatory. And the first sound that I heard being the, dump truck, picking up the dumpster outside my dorm window at five in the morning. And I thought the world was going to end and <laugh>. And since then, I've noticed the tempo of my body being different in a city environment than in the rural upbringing that I had. And, and a lot of the work is constantly sort of trying to unpack this tension or dichotomy between urban and rural in my own life. And then, how that dichotomy, green space and urban environments and, our memories or idealizations of nature come up in both music and artworks, but in life in general, ways that people who live in cities engage with green space. Ways that, people who lived in one idealized the other, those sorts of things come up in the work all the time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, it's really interesting you say it that way because it is, it is true. I now live in a rural environment, or I have for quite a while actually, people in the city, often when I tell them where I, where I live, they have this idea that it's, you know, pretty much waking up and frolicking in a garden, you know, and then allowing the wind to whistle through my hair with <span style="color:red" data-ts="212.545" data-end_ts="212.765" title="212.545" id=c_"212.545">__ne__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="212.885" data-end_ts="213.005" title="212.885" id=c_"212.885">__a__</span> worry, you know? And conversely, here in the area where I live, everyone talks about the city as the land of opportunity and bright lights and, and excitement at all times. Yeah. And it's, it really is funny how that has become a societal dichotomy for us. I mean, it's serious one. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Seth: </b>Yeah, for sure. I mean, for me, I have some really early sound memories that, that are hard to experience in the, in the city, but I, I find myself hunting for them. And I, I think the tendency to want to sort of romanticize the place you aren't <laugh> is, is heavy. And so, you know, it's hard, it's hard not to wax nostalgic about a nature that's disappearing. And, and I think that's part of the problem. I think, you know, there's this philosopher Tim Morton who, wrote a, a book a a bunch. He's a bunch of wonderful writings on nature, but one of his big arguments is that this sort of 19th century bucolic version of, of nature, the pastoral scene that you described, the wind whistling through your hair is, is part of our problem with our ability to deal with climate change. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Seth: </b>It's this, version of nature that comes straight out of sort of 19th century idealism that, that says that, you know, nature is this special thing that's other than us, that's a place that we return to. And, and really it's this thing that's all around us constantly, and we ought to pay some attention to it, or we're gonna keep breaking it. And it, it needs to be more practical, like our car, you know, like your car breaks, you fix it. A concept like nature exists as a concept, <span style="color:red" data-ts="307.875" data-end_ts="308.165" title="307.875" id=c_"307.875">__then__</span> we're not so invested in in the fix, we're invested in maintaining the idea. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="314.585" data-end_ts="314.805" title="314.585" id=c_"314.585">__Did__</span>, when I did a fly by on your website, I was kind of floored by the amount of different kinds of work you do. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So you're, you're a very accomplished composer with a lot of, with a hell of a discography basically. But you also do a lot of visual work and, and a lot of that is done in the form of installation works. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you are one of these people who, I guess I think of as multimedia to the extreme right. From a distance, it seems that you are equally capable and maybe equally drawn to all types of media art simultaneously. Yeah. Is that, is that fair? Or do you find that different interests ebb and flow for you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Seth: </b>I mean, there's certainly a little bit of ebb and flow. Some of that's like what opportunities come up. I've tried with my, with my artistic life to not force the career side. So I, I sort of, I keep making work and opportunities come and I address them. And, and I'm not out there with a big flag saying, look at, look at Seth Klut, look what he's doing. And so a lot of this has been, letting my mind go to the medium that makes the most sense to address the thing I'm obsessed with at the time. And, and so that might mean, I think a good example would be like in, 2009 I did a solo exhibition at <span style="color:red" data-ts="398.445" data-end_ts="399.005" title="398.445" id=c_"398.445">__Diapason__</span> Gallery, and that one was based around these recordings from Ringing Rock State Park in Bucks County, pa, which is this wonderful place that, where people like pack up the station wagon with hammers and they, and they go into the park and it's got these rocks that are made out of a material that when you hit them, they chime. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Seth: </b>I was obsessed for a while with this idea of audio tourism, like places that people would go to listen to things instead of places people would go to look. And, and you know, that that obsession with that idea led to this 18 channel installation algorithmically generated timings for the, for the playing back of these sound files and, and tones that were somehow partially related to real <span style="color:red" data-ts="444.845" data-end_ts="445.005" title="444.845" id=c_"444.845">__time__</span> analysis of the room and the people in it, and, you know, all of this fancy stuff. And at the, at the end of the day, people would just sit in it and bliss out with these recordings of the, of the chimes. But, it made sense to do it in that version at that time. And then when Richard Chartier approached me about the possibility of doing a release online at the time, a sub-label of 12 k Taylor <span style="color:red" data-ts="466.675" data-end_ts="466.965" title="466.675" id=c_"466.675">__tore__</span> label, mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Seth: </b><affirmative>, I, I, I did that record actually, I think is a good summary of my practice. You know, it has, it has three sort of scored compositions, one for so percussion with compressed air canisters and amplified paper, and then another for catch guitar quartet that's, <span style="color:red" data-ts="489.035" data-end_ts="489.325" title="489.035" id=c_"489.035">__sign__</span> tones and, and electric guitars and bass and, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="492.645" data-end_ts="492.765" title="492.645" id=c_"492.645">__a__</span>, a piece for clogs, this, ensemble with <span style="color:red" data-ts="497.035" data-end_ts="497.325" title="497.035" id=c_"497.035">__Patm__</span> Newsom and Bryce Desser from the national and, and then a live performance of me doing amplified objects with some processing. And then this documentation of the installation at <span style="color:red" data-ts="508.965" data-end_ts="509.525" title="508.965" id=c_"508.965">__Diapason__</span> Gallery. And, and all of those pieces are obsessed with the same problem, which is how do you situate yourself with your sound memories while you are listening? And so each one of them is, is sort of, investigating different ways of addressing sound memory. And so a lot of times the common thread through all of this, we crazy diversity of of work is, is that I'm interested in the idea so much that I'll just come at it from all the angles. I see. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now when you do this <span style="color:red" data-ts="545.475" data-end_ts="545.765" title="545.475" id=c_"545.475">__kind__</span> of stuff and you're, and you're kind of focused on sound memories, is it always your sound memories? Or have you found a way to get people to talk about their sound memories and then try to rep reproduce those? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Seth: </b>Yeah, I thought about this a a lot early on. Well, like, whether I should be really autobiographical about some of this and, and, and what I've, what I've come to, I think, and when I, and now when I teach students myself, I emphasize is I'm trying to aim these ideas at archetypes that there are some kind of sound memories that, that if you are general enough about them, everybody can identify with enough to be able to sort of go on the path with you. I did a piece for the Rodia Network for Wave Farm Transmission Arts. With that piece, I had made field recordings of rain, in every apartment that I'd lived in since I had grown up, in, in my home, in Poston, <span style="color:red" data-ts="603.205" data-end_ts="603.365" title="603.205" id=c_"603.205">__go__</span> New York. And, I have recordings from literally every one of those apartments. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Seth: </b>And, and I made this sort of radio piece that's, that's an unfolding of, and then super imposition ultimately of a lot of these different rainstorms. And, I lived in Ohio for two years when I was a visiting professor at Miami University, and there's tornado sirens in the background. And, my wife and I lived in, in, Paris for a year. And in, there's rain with European, an ambulances in the background. And, and there's the sound of, rain on my parents' porch roof with the sound of the wind chimes in the background. And, and each of these sort of juxtapositions of, of the places, there's enough in each of them that people can identify with that I think people, it stands a good chance of people sort of falling into their own memories as a result of these triggers. And, you know, I, I'm obsessed, I think with this, there are two parallel concepts, one of <span style="color:red" data-ts="658.615" data-end_ts="658.965" title="658.615" id=c_"658.615">__phone__</span> ESIS and the other of Anamnesis. And one is, where a sound triggers a visual image in the mind, and then the other is where you see a visual image and it triggers a sound in the mind, and Right. And, and I think if the, if you generalize these kinds of ideas with archetypes, then, then you can do a good deal. You can have the listener do a good deal of the narrative work, <laugh> for you <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Yeah. I, I get that. <span style="color:red" data-ts="686.845" data-end_ts="686.965" title="686.845" id=c_"686.845">__I__</span>, at the, on the other side, when you're talking about things like, when you're talking about things like struck objects in the, and the resonant sound of them and stuff like that. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> that is, that has much more of a revelatory or, explorational quality to it than a memory quality, don't you think? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Seth: </b>Oh, yeah, for sure. And the, the way that the people, especially, in Doro, the piece that, that you're referring to, the, the way that, the idea that a family would go to a park with hammers and everyone would sort of shout and, and yell, listen to this one <laugh>, you know, this idea that like it's total amateur hour, everyone becoming their own expert at exploring a natural environment through an implement that gives you access to sound, you know? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> that for me is like, like, I think, the potential that I see in, in every human being to find a sense of experimentalism that gives them joy, you know, and I, and I, and if you go to this park sometime, which I entirely encourage you to do, next time you're out on the east coast, <span style="color:red" data-ts="765.665" data-end_ts="765.885" title="765.665" id=c_"765.665">__you__</span> go there on a Saturday and the parking lot is full, and it's full with people who've driven there from very far away, some license plates from outta state. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Seth: </b>And it's just people taking great joy in hitting rocks with hammers and finding good sounds, <laugh>, you know, and, and it has, and you can hear the exploration in the sounds. It's like tick, tick, tick, ticking, you know, and it's like hunting and pecking and then discovery, and then sometimes even exclamation that they had discovered something. So, and those sounds of discovery are in the recordings as well. So a lot of it is, you know, a sound that shows you this process of uncovering these rock chimes and then someone shouting <span style="color:red" data-ts="803.145" data-end_ts="803.365" title="803.145" id=c_"803.145">__in__</span> joy that they had just discovered one, which I think is, you can't, you can't knock that kind of joy. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, indeed. But it also sounds like an artwork that's almost like self-referential, because that kind of thing would've also gone through you as you were listening to the recording, and then becomes the feeling of the people that are, are listening to it as part of the, the playback of the recording too. You know, it just ends up being a, an examination and an, and an exclamation of joy, whether internal or external. But you know, that, that seems to be sort of like the cycle that keeps on giving in that case. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Seth: </b>Oh, yeah, for sure. And I, you know, during the time of that solo exhibition, I was invited by Judson Church, the, movement research, festival to do, a dance piece up there where dancers would like <span style="color:red" data-ts="857.985" data-end_ts="858.205" title="857.985" id=c_"857.985">__pat__</span>, they packed into a bus, there was maybe 20 of them. We went up to ringing rocks with the whole, <span style="color:red" data-ts="864.595" data-end_ts="864.885" title="864.595" id=c_"864.595">__with__</span> like, you know, parked in front of Judson Church and then drove up in a van to, to, bucks County pa. And, and, these dancers got scores that they wore around their neck. The scores were upside down so that they could see them while they were walking. And the, and the park is in, is inhospitable to walking. It's, it's a, the, it's all these giant rocks and you climb on the rock. So, and we went out and <span style="color:red" data-ts="889.365" data-end_ts="889.525" title="889.365" id=c_"889.365">__they__</span>, everyone had these cassette dictaphone recorders that they could play back the sounds and listen to them and record them. And everyone just, went nuts trying to explore this, this space. And, and I just found like that was yet another layer of, of, of, of interesting joy that can come about, with people engaging, spaces like this. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Very interesting. So, one of the things that I do know about you is that you are, you are an instructor at Stevens, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Seth: </b>It's true. It's true. What do you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Teach there? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Seth: </b>That's a little complicated. I, I have a joint <laugh>. I have a joint appointment, in music and technology. I was hired in music and technology, and, I am, I have a full joint appointment in visual arts and technology as well. And so I teach a sound art course in the visual art department. And then I teach, electronic music classes, computer music, acoustics, some signal processing and that sort of thing. It's the, the underside of my, of, of my, my secret computer music roots <laugh>, where I, I do that on the teaching end. And then I'm also this year, visiting, faculty at Columbia University in the graduate program in sound arts. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Ah, interesting. Okay. So one of the things that I've had experience with is sort of seeing the difference between art school and music school. And I find it kind of fascinating actually, especially when you're dealing with sound in art school, because it's kind of a, you know, it's not as mainstream as sculpture or painting or whatever, but, it seems to certainly draw a lot of interest. What do you find is the main difference between people that have self-identified and put themselves in music school from those that have done the same and put themselves in art school? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Seth: </b>Oh, that's an interesting question. I had to face this, you know, head on. I took a year off after undergrad. I had gone to eCom immediately after, undergrad, to study with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1028.875" data-end_ts="1029.095" title="1028.875" id=c_"1028.875">__ze__</span>. And, and then I, I had been making, at the time these works where I was like putting, you know, brass instruments, playing through the heating ducks into the concert hall. And there was a lot of performance stuff, and it was working its way towards installation. So after a year out of school, I, I thought, okay, I'll go to RPI to Resser Polytechnic Institute, and I'll do this electronic art degree. 'cause I could do computer music there, or electronic music, or I could do visual arts stuff, and they would support me in my, in in that, in that, trying to figure out who I was. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Seth: </b>And, and, and when I got there, you know, I was kind of like the, I was like the weirdest kid at music school, and then I was like the most conservative kid at art school, <laugh>. And, and so I figured out like, you know, like artists think musicians are formalists most of the time, right? Like, you know, everything is about, you know, pure perception and ex and experience, and it, it sort of reduces itself to what in art, in the art world is formalism. And then, the musicians think the artists are all about ideas and, and there's no understanding of the flowing of time and, and that sort of thing in a, in a practical sense. And, and so for me, a lot of the time it's, I've taught, workshops and stuff and a bunch of sound art graduate programs. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Seth: </b>And now that I'm teaching one in a, in a grad program, I've taught at undergrad as well, I've found that the, the need for musicians to be shown the way that sounds can signify things that are outside of musical language organization is super important. And the way that artists need to be shown that if they're able to understand how acoustics works, how some signal processing works, that they're able to better control the way that their ideas signify themselves in the work. So a lot of the times, you know, you'll have a student who will want to evoke a, you know, mono AM radio in a, in a piece as a way of, you know, being nostalgic and mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, if you understand, you know, sort of the filtering and the application of a particular amount of distortion that yields am radio sound that can come from, you know, the, electronic and computer music has spent decades trying to figure out how to, how to get urs correct. And then, you know, the art world has spent decades trying to figure out what ideas mean through sound. And, and when you merge those two things, you get, it's kind of like a, for some <span style="color:red" data-ts="1169.325" data-end_ts="1169.485" title="1169.325" id=c_"1169.325">__of__</span> some of these artists, when they really, agree to go over to the other side, whether they're music headed to art or art headed to music, it's kind of a superpower for them because they can, they can harness the best of both worlds to get, a clear message across. And, and I, I think that's the potential, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and they certainly have the opportunity to bring a, a different kind of voice. I remember thinking that, I remember having a discussion with somebody and I was like, to me one of the differences was their approach to tools and virtuosity, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And the fact that in a lot of music schools, there still is kind of a lively debate about whether a saxophone is an actual instrument, because it's only been around a couple hundred years, right? And <span style="color:red" data-ts="1216.045" data-end_ts="1216.245" title="1216.045" id=c_"1216.045">__in__</span> the media art world, oftentimes if a tool has been around for a week, it's already been supplanted by a newer tool, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Seth: </b><laugh> Yeah, for sure. Yep. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And so, two very different approaches to thinking about what the tooling is, for, for those works. So one of the things that, I do like doing in my podcast is talking to people about their background. Now, you mentioned a little bit about this background in, rural New York. I am curious, though, a lot of times rural environments are not super embracing of the kid that wants to be an artist, right? Mm-Hmm mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, how did you, how were you able to navigate your way through that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Seth: </b>It's complicated, but I, maybe all of these answers are a bit complicated, but the, the, I was immensely lucky. Even in my crazy rural small high school, my freshman year of high school, I had a choral teacher, who also taught a music theory class who had dropped out of Eastman as one of the first women to go through, their composition, DMA, and she played for us, Pauline Oliver's horse Sings from Cloud, the accordion <span style="color:red" data-ts="1290.085" data-end_ts="1290.245" title="1290.085" id=c_"1290.085">__and__</span> voice, record, cages, sonatas, and interludes for prepared piano crumbs, ancient voices of children, repi the Pines of Rome, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1298.895" data-end_ts="1299.245" title="1298.895" id=c_"1298.895">__right__</span> of spring, of course. But, and then Morton <span style="color:red" data-ts="1302.125" data-end_ts="1302.165" title="1302.125" id=c_"1302.125">__Za__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1302.165" data-end_ts="1302.485" title="1302.165" id=c_"1302.165">__Botnick__</span> Silver Apples of the Moon that paired with seeing Bartok concerto for orchestra with the Albany Symphony Orchestra when I was in eighth grade. And then the last bit was, her brother was a film composer, and he had died young, young of cancer and had, they had a Roland Juno 1 0 6 in a reel-to-reel machine in the choral room. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Seth: </b>And, and I was gone, like, that year was basically just like, I had been playing in like a Fugazi style cover band before that. And that year was just that, like shook the ashes, that's gray, like my life had been written on <span style="color:red" data-ts="1336.915" data-end_ts="1337.205" title="1336.915" id=c_"1336.915">__this__</span>, that just gets for my whole, for my whole growing up. And then, and then shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, and it's gray. And I've got this like, crazy blank slate of creativity. An entire world opened up for me. And so I ended up, pursuing a bunch of really weird stuff really early. And luckily, my, my parents were super supportive of this. My dad is a tinkerer, he's a machinist. And my mom, when I was growing up, was a, a secretary and then later a jeweler. And so the house was always filled with some form of creativity, whether it was kind of Appalachian folk music, which is the stuff that they would play on the weekends or, or making things with the hands. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1375.665" data-end_ts="1375.885" title="1375.665" id=c_"1375.665">__It__</span> just, it was always supported that, that I would end up being a musician, and then later an artist, as the output would sort of define me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Very interesting. Now, one of the things that you mentioned to me when we were first started talking is that you recently, you have been pulled in as an artist in residence at Bell Labs. Is that 
</p>

<p>
<b>Seth: </b>Right? Yes. Yeah. Since May 15 of this year, I've been, full-time, with an office and a studio. In fact, I'm talking to you from my studio at Murray Hill in New Jersey, on the Bell Labs campus. I've been, maintaining a studio here since May. And, and I'll go until at least January, if not, the following May, when the creative side of my, residency wraps up with a, a large performance with the International Contemporary Ensemble. But I've been here, that whole time, and it's been a really quite spectacular experience. The, the history here is, is Rich and everywhere. 'cause this is the original 1941 building that Bell Labs built. After they, they left the Westbeth building, where <span style="color:red" data-ts="1436.805" data-end_ts="1437.045" title="1436.805" id=c_"1436.805">__Mers__</span> Cunningham Studios was. Martha Graham is now, was the original Western Electric building in the West Village. And, and this building out here is where Max Matthews worked on the first computer music languages. And Jim Tenney was in residence for three years here in the sixties. And Lillian Schwartz did, video stuff here in the seventies and Laurie Spiegel, and it's, you know, and it's everywhere here. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I was gonna say, the history there is dripping from the walls, quite literally. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Seth: </b>Yeah. Yep. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So what is your work there? What are you attempting to, to do while you're there? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Seth: </b>So, I'm the second artist in residence. The, the first was Jeff Thompson, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1474.465" data-end_ts="1474.685" title="1474.465" id=c_"1474.465">__was__</span> a really interesting kinetic, sculptor. Does a lot of tech-based artworks makes robots and things. My residency has morphed into sort of three roles. I am embedded on at least two, but, I consult with a number of other research teams, as a way to kind of introduce some divergent thinking into their research process. Which basically means I come in when they're doing demos of what they're working on, and then I give them critique that's different than the normal sort of linear science approach to, to r and d. And then the second part, I'm helping them, refine and clarify some of their public demos for technology. So they come up with a neat thing, and then their tendency is to wanna show it really literally, and that's not always the most effective route. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Seth: </b>So, so I help them think about how they might show some of their ideas a little bit more clearly. Then the third part is working on some creative projects of my own, which has been pretty amazing because, you know, over the last 10 years, the, the curve of, busyness in my career has made it so that I have been making work for particular opportunities. And, and I promised myself, 'cause I knew the residency was coming down the pike about six months ahead, I basically was able to keep my summer completely clear except for one gig, in Paris of all things. And then I had the entire summer with nothing to do except for sit in a room by myself and figure out how to make art again, from scratch. So I've been doing some loudspeaker experiments, spending a lot of time in the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1569.045" data-end_ts="1569.325" title="1569.045" id=c_"1569.045">__koic__</span> chamber trying to figure out what parts of spatial audio are happening that are not about the mechanical part of the year, but are happening neurologically. I've been trying to think about sound image relationships in different ways with different forms of display and just sort of freewheeling it, through the, through the summer. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. Yeah. You mentioned the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1590.745" data-end_ts="1590.965" title="1590.745" id=c_"1590.745">__och__</span> chamber. I was wondering what are other, like affordances you get by having a, by having a lab there? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Seth: </b>Last year they built a really impressive facility around the already kind of impressive historic anti coic chamber here. The, the chamber was built in 47, and for some 30 years it was the Guinness Book of World Records holder for the quietest room in the world. And there's even a mention of it in Helen Keller's diary, saying that it's the first time that she ever really experienced silence. So like, it's, it's enough on its own, but they, they managed to pair it with a room that they designed in collaboration with Arup Acoustics, Anne Guthrie and Terrence Calkins, worked on it. And it's a 64 channel loudspeaker system in a room that's coupled to the Koic chamber. So you can play sound in the Koic chamber and then render it, either in Wavefield or in onic in the anti chamber, which is the name they call the, the room with the loudspeakers in it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Seth: </b>Okay. So it's, you know, 64 channels of, of Gen X with four subs, in a room that's really dry and perfect, with relatively infinite routing. So those two things are, are quite spectacular. There's a bunch of other Antioch chambers here that are RF koic chambers that are, koic for radio frequencies. So I've played around in one of those. There's a machine shop in the basement that's a union shop that does a building for any of the prototypes that they make. There's a model shop with a person who is a third generation model maker who helps build working model prototypes of, of invention. So there's quite a lot. And then in parallel to that, the new museum has three artists and residents here at the same time as me. So <span style="color:red" data-ts="1688.745" data-end_ts="1688.965" title="1688.745" id=c_"1688.745">__Su__</span>, Gwen Chung, Lisa Park and Hammer <span style="color:red" data-ts="1691.395" data-end_ts="1691.685" title="1691.395" id=c_"1691.395">__Step__</span> are here in addition to, to my residency. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, one of the things you talk about is like helping them think about doing demos of their stuff. And I have to admit that I don't even know where such a thing would play. I mean, it used to be, not like I've experienced this, but I've read about how, you know, there there'd be the Great Worlds <span style="color:red" data-ts="1711.815" data-end_ts="1712.165" title="1711.815" id=c_"1711.815">__Faron__</span>, so they, you know, organizations would work for, for a long time to make sort of like the thing that drew the public into the technology. Now it seems like technology is so omnipresent, it's hard to even think about having to do anything to demo it other than just like, you know, call a trade paper and say, Hey, I'm doing this thing <laugh>. Sure. You know, what kind of, what kind of assistance do you give them? What kind of ideas do you give them that allow them to be maybe a little less concrete about their description of their work? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Seth: </b>So one of the, one of the examples is, is, they're working on some technology that will enable very, a very high level of localization of, of a cell phone, even with visual occlusion. So, so one of the problems with delivering wireless in cities is that buildings get in the way. And so you have these canyons and valleys where there's not a very good cell signal. And so in order to target phones to get them better service, and then also for potential AR and VR applications, they need to think of ways of utilizing reflections off buildings and other kinds of, effects to localize cell phones down to, a very low level of accuracy. And so, so I'm, one of the, the things that I'm, I'm working on is the idea of doing a, a piece in <span style="color:red" data-ts="1801.005" data-end_ts="1801.125" title="1801.005" id=c_"1801.005">__a__</span>, in one of the public parks in, in New York, Madison Square Park, or Owls <span style="color:red" data-ts="1805.445" data-end_ts="1805.565" title="1805.445" id=c_"1805.445">__Head__</span> in Bay Ridge, or, you know, one of these parks, where there's a lot of buildings around the, the park. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Seth: </b>And then thinking about how to make a, an app that is, is a musical composition and a little bit of a game for people to, for the cell phones themselves, to make sounds, for people to find one another within the park for people to recognize the way that the technology is localizing them by, by giving them something to explore the rewards them for that, exploration. And so, so in this particular piece, I'm, I'm trying to develop recordings in the Adirondacks of a, of a, a parcel of land that's exactly the same dimension as say Madison Square Park. And then super imposing these ambisonic recordings of a bunch of, in a grid of that park Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1852.845" data-end_ts="1853.085" title="1852.845" id=c_"1852.845">__onto__</span> the Madison Square Park. And then giving people the ability to walk through the Adirondacks by walking through the park. That's a, an example of, of, of the kind of scale of, you know, something that looks on the outside like an artwork and then, and then is also simultaneously showing a, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1869.205" data-end_ts="1869.325" title="1869.205" id=c_"1869.205">__a__</span>, a benefit of a new way of thinking about Sailor telephony. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Interesting. Now, one other thing that I did run across in looking at your bio information and some of your discography and stuff is your interaction with, Pauline Olivarez. You mentioned that, her work, one of our works was one of the things that was an influential thing that you heard early in your musical life. But you've gone on to have a lot of interaction with her over the years, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Seth: </b>Yeah, it's true. 20 years, just short of 20, years before she passed. Last year when I was an under observatory, there was this wonderful trustee there named Trudy Morse, who was, Cecil Taylor's road manager of <laugh> amongst other things. And she, she sort of, saw me in some of the weird stuff that I was doing, and she commissioned me to write a piece for Poet and Accordion. And, and I went over to, I went over to a faculty member's house who had a Sin <span style="color:red" data-ts="1929.365" data-end_ts="1929.765" title="1929.365" id=c_"1929.365">__Clubier__</span>, and I took these recordings of E Cummings and Gertrude Stein, and I made this tape mashup, and then this graphic score for a poet and an accordionist to play. And, she gave me, and it, the invite came on a postcard. It just said, show up at this address on Broadway in Kingston, New York on this date. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Seth: </b>And we'll do the piece. We don't need to rehearse it. I think everyone will understand the score. So I show up at this, at this address, and it's the deep listening space. And the Accordionist, the Accordionist is Pauline. So, <laugh> and I, you know, my jaw drops because I had just made this tape piece with the Vir that was, E Cummings and Gertrude Stein having it out <laugh>, you know. So I thought to myself like, here we go, <laugh>. Right. You know, and, and, and I, I've been working with her in one form or another ever since I had started my, the MFA at RPI before she got there. And I took a year's leave of absence to work at the Harvard Institute for Music and Brain Science. And when, Curtis Bond gave me a call and said, Pauline, Oliveres <span style="color:red" data-ts="1989.085" data-end_ts="1989.245" title="1989.085" id=c_"1989.085">__has__</span> agreed to come and teach here, would you be interested in coming back to the program? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Seth: </b>I, I jumped at the chance and then worked with her for the rest of my MFA while I was there. And then, most recently, the Wow and Flutter Festival, that was the, I think 40th anniversary of the San Francisco Tape Music Center, the book that came out on the University of California press. Right. I had the, the honor and Fear inducing, role of David Tudor in her Apple Box double, which I then, performed again with her, the September before she passed away at the nine evenings 50th anniversary reboot at Friedman Gallery, where we performed Apple Box double again. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That must have been intimidating to have to sit in that chair. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Seth: </b>Oh, yeah. No, very intimidating. But the, she made it wonderful because when we went to perform it the first time, she invited me down to her house in, in Kingston, which was purple by the way. And we went to a, an old industrial surplus store, and we walked around the, the store finding things to attach to the Apple box. So if you're not familiar with this piece, it's, it's an Apple box that's got a contact mic on it. And, and she had this in her studio in the sixties, and she just put stuff on it and would record to tape through the Apple box, and it would be kind of like a fake reverb or a, the Apple box would lend a character to the amplified, whatever you put on top of it. And so we went to the surplus store and found springs and pieces of metal and rods and all sorts of stuff to attach to my Apple box, which I had picked up on the way down at an Apple farm in the Catskills. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Seth: </b>And, and then when we, we walked back up to her house and I said, okay, you know, I'm excited to rehearse. She said, that was the rehearsal, <laugh> and <laugh>, you know, and I, and, and it's, you know, it's, it's an interesting, the story goes on. I had a residency at Wave Farm up in the Catskills, and, the International Contemporary Ensemble was doing a piece of mine at Aron's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2106.805" data-end_ts="2106.885" title="2106.805" id=c_"2106.805">__Art__</span> Center on the same day as they were the same ensemble had an, a different subset of the group up at Bard College doing a retrospective of some <span style="color:red" data-ts="2115.365" data-end_ts="2115.485" title="2115.365" id=c_"2115.365">__of__</span> Pauline's work. And I was stuck in the cap <span style="color:red" data-ts="2117.685" data-end_ts="2117.925" title="2117.685" id=c_"2117.685">__skill__</span> Catskills without a car, and I couldn't go to either event. And so I wrote her an email and said, I'm sorry that I won't be able to attend this event. And, and I was hoping that we'd be able to rehearse for the September show. And, she said, us our pieces meeting in the Ether is the rehearsal for the September show, and, and that will be fine. And so we did the show in September and, and we got a very nice document, of that that's on the Friedman website, and played a great trio with Maria Chavez, as well, which was, a real pleasure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Wonderful. So you have done so many things and, and had your fingers in so, so many stuff, but it sounds like some of it is kind of, you know, you've, you've got timeframes on them, so you're doing the thing at Columbia, but that's gonna wrap up soon. You're doing the thing at Bell Labs, but that'll eventually wrap up. What do you think is the next things around the, around the bend for you? <span style="color:red" data-ts="2176.585" data-end_ts="2176.805" title="2176.585" id=c_"2176.585">__Mm__</span>. Where, where, where are the areas that you're exploring right now? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Seth: </b>That's a good question. I'm, I hope this year never ends <laugh>, you know, I, you know, I, I feel I, having time and space is a real joy. And so I'm finding myself wanting to use this year's worth of time and space to try to remind myself, leave reminders, like hidden on little pieces of paper, stuck in books to just find time and space to make work without pressure, which, you know, seems like a total luxury. But for me in the future, in terms of the work, I think everything is sort of coming together. The, the piece for that I'm doing at the end of my residency here with Bell Labs is a collaboration with the International Contemporary Ensemble, where I'm making site specific work for the inside of each of their instruments by 3D printing loudspeakers and holders for microphones that will be inside of each of the acoustic instruments. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Seth: </b>And then writing some chamber music that they play that also plays inside each other's instruments. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And that is the closest complete merger of things that I care about in the installation practice, things that I care about in the sort of exploratory performance practice and things that I care about as a composer, happening all at once. And so I'm, my hope is that I'll have the courage to not do so many small things and to dedicate my time to some bigger projects where I really feel I can get invested and take some risks, because safe just isn't cutting it, anymore in terms of, the sort of steady state I want time, and then things that are real realizations of my ideas. And, and that is gonna take some planning in and of itself, I think. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. It's, it's interesting to think about choosing risk as kind of a future proposition. 'cause it, it just sort of points to the fact that sometimes in, in doing artwork, safety just isn't really an option. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Seth: </b>No. And especially as the resources get more and more scarce, and we have to devote some of our free time to, ensuring that those resources continue in whatever small amount they might, time becomes a real crucial component in how we think about ourselves as artists and as academics, I think. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That's a great point. Well, Seth, I want to thank you so much for, again, taking the time outta your schedule, sitting down at Bell Labs there and having a chat, chat with us. It's really been fascinating to hear, hear the work about the work you're doing and the perspectives that you take on it, man. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Seth: </b>Oh, thanks so much. It's just been a, a real pleasure Darwin, and thank you for doing this series. It's a, a labor of love and it's a great benefit to our community. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2347.705" data-end_ts="2347.925" title="2347.705" id=c_"2347.705">__Oh__</span>, thank you so much. Well, with that, I'm going to say goodbye and let you have the rest of your day. Catch you later, man. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Seth: </b>Alright, thanks Darwin. Bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Hey, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2356.845" data-end_ts="2357.005" title="2356.845" id=c_"2356.845">__all__</span>, thanks again for listening. Thanks to Seth for having the chat. Very interesting. And, thanks for joining me for another, midweek podcast. It's a lot of fun to be able to do this double up on these here early in December. I know it's getting cold and messy outside for a lot of us, so it's nice to have something different to enjoy. I also want to make sure that you're aware that we still have that Kickstarter going. We're just about to our goal. We have some ideas for a stretch goal if you just get, get us there. But in the meantime, reach out, help support the podcast if you can. Thanks a lot for listening. Thanks a lot for sharing it with friends, and I'll talk to you again soon. Bye.
