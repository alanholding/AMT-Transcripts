<b>Darwin: </b><i>Okay today, I get, I have the great opportunity to talk to somebody that was actually introduced to me by, this person's publicist, his name's Roger <span style="color:red" data-ts="11.52" data-end_ts="12.06" title="11.52" id=c_"11.52">__Neil__</span>. And, as I, as I got the info and the more I learned out learned about him, the more intrigued I was, I mean, quite frankly, it was pretty intriguing to find out that he and I, and my birthday are the same day. So that was a great start. I knew there was going to be some alignment, but, as I went through his body of work, I was really pretty blown away. And so, I'm very excited to get a chance to talk to Roger Neal. Hey, Roger, how's it going? Hey, great. Good <span style="color:red" data-ts="41.65" data-end_ts="41.73" title="41.65" id=c_"41.65">__to__</span>, good to talk to you. I thank you so much for taking time out of your schedule to have this chat. I really appreciate it. For people who might not be, aware of your work, why don't we start off by having you talk a little bit about, what you're currently working on and kind of what your body work represents? </i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Roger Neill: </b>Oh, great. Yeah. Well, I'm a composer, I'm a film composer, primarily film television games. Most recently I did <span style="color:red" data-ts="68.51" data-end_ts="68.68" title="68.51" id=c_"68.51">__something__</span> come out this month called Valley girl. So my more well known projects include the film 20th century women and beginners. That was Academy award winning films, although not for me, but great films, the TV series, Mozart in the jungle series King of the Hill, and many others. I've been doing this for a number of decades now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><i>Yeah, you have, you have quite a, quite a body of work indeed. I was lucky enough to like, stumble across your sound called Paige. And it's kind of a neat compendium of a lot of your work. Now, one of the things I thought was interesting was that you seem to be super adept at kind of like latching onto any sort of stylistic thing and really bringing it home in a pretty, in a pretty straightforward way. So like whether it's sort of seventies, late seventies, synth poppy kind of stuff, or a theory ambient or especially one of the things, I noticed was that you have done some scoring work for a recent set of animations on adult swim by JG <span style="color:red" data-ts="142.61" data-end_ts="143" title="142.61" id=c_"142.61">__village__</span>. Listening to that, that seemed like every 20 seconds there was a completely different musical style. Right. What, tell me a little bit about how you feel about working in that kind of thing and, and sort of like having to embrace the, you know, styles on a minute by minute basis. </i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Roger: </b>Well, it's the tricky thing about being a, <span style="color:red" data-ts="167.22" data-end_ts="167.48" title="167.22" id=c_"167.22">__some__</span> composer, because it's, you, you need to be in some ways a scholar of music genres, just because you want to be able to have access to the sounds that are appropriate to any, any moment or any storyline that you're going to be involved with. And it's, you're more likely to have a thriving query if you, if you can sort of put on a number of different identities as a composer. Sometimes I like in it to deem like a character actor who can play a lot of different kinds of roles, but always, hopefully has that one thing about them that makes them interesting in every role, you know, someone like a Gary Oldman or Willem Defoe, that kind of character actor they're always themselves, but they also bring something so unique and you can see those guys, you know, in period pieces and, and different, you know, identities. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Roger: </b>And so the <span style="color:red" data-ts="221.41" data-end_ts="221.68" title="221.41" id=c_"221.41">__Felker__</span> partner, it's kind of a similarity cause you kinda need to be able to put on <span style="color:red" data-ts="225.71" data-end_ts="225.85" title="225.71" id=c_"225.71">__it's__</span> different kinds of identities, but also hopefully have your own voice, you know, and that's <span style="color:red" data-ts="231.46" data-end_ts="231.73" title="231.46" id=c_"231.46">__kinda__</span> kind of tricky thing. I think <span style="color:red" data-ts="233.05" data-end_ts="233.15" title="233.05" id=c_"233.05">__this__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="233.15" data-end_ts="233.25" title="233.15" id=c_"233.15">__is__</span> kind of a thing that a lot of us composers strive for that with JJ Avalara is fairytales. That was, we kind of took advantage of that because <span style="color:red" data-ts="241.45" data-end_ts="242.08" title="241.45" id=c_"241.45">__Jayden's__</span> is a nut and he's always like kind of like bouncing around tonally and stylistically with his, with his animation and the storytelling. So we're always like every 20 seconds changing to like some other reference or some other kind of sound, you know? So, so, you know, we <span style="color:red" data-ts="259.57" data-end_ts="259.81" title="259.57" id=c_"259.57">__switched__</span> to like take advantage of just like the, the different, different tools in the toolbox. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><i>Sure. Is there, is there any style that you particularly feel at home with and conversely, any style that is really particularly hard for you? </i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Roger: </b>Well, I'm a sort of conventionally trained classical musician on one hand. And the other hand, like I'm a, I'm a, I'm a guitarist, I'm like a sort of pop music guy record producer songwriter, and I have that sensibility as well. So, that helps me sort of helps you kind of mix it up and into answer, like make sort of a, an arsenal of, of, abilities that I can use for, for whatever comes across. Now, occasionally might be times when I'm asked to do something that's violet Stickley, specific, which is not in my wheelhouse, but sometimes that actually gets really interesting results. Like for example, this hasn't happened, but let's say, I was asked to do a soundtrack for a film in the style of Drake. I wouldn't be the first call for that, but let's say someone, I probably wouldn't be able to pull it off effectively if that was really the intention, but on my journey to try to sound like Drake, I would probably come up with something at least unusual that might really be the best result. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><i>Yeah. That makes a lot of sense. Right. You know, there's all kinds of questions about sort of the mechanics of doing film composition and I'm sure that every project is different, but how often, how often you find yourself in a position of working with film directors or animation directors or whatever, where they kind of fancy themselves musicians a bit as well. And so they ended up being really involved in the scoring process. </i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Roger: </b>Yeah. That does happen. There's, kind of a stock reply from composers generally. Cause I, I, I will talk to my, my composing colleagues and we'll share more stories about, and, there's sort of a cliche with some truth to it, which is that, the most dangerous director or producer is someone who has a little bit of knowledge because at the little bit they know exactly how to ask you to run questions and to direct you in the wrong way. But, for the most part, I feel like it's my job in, as a, as a film composer, as a, as a collaborative storyteller to find a way to really communicate with the director. I mean, I'm inviting them into my field. And so sometimes they may say things which may be questionable and I will, you know, hopefully find a way to, did, help define what they're looking looking for, or even if they have no idea, what kind of words to use to talk with me about music, I will help them sort of find a way to speak in a way that gets me to write the music that they're looking for. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Roger: </b>They have something in mind, the fact that they have something in mind, but they <span style="color:red" data-ts="447.13" data-end_ts="447.45" title="447.13" id=c_"447.13">__end__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="447.47" data-end_ts="447.58" title="447.47" id=c_"447.47">__up__</span> there I'm on a journey that you're trying to help them complete. Some directors who really love hanging out with me in my studio and will almost to the point of writing the score with me sitting next to me, when it works well, it works really well. Except it goes a little bit slower. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Roger: </b>One director, quite a lot who I respect quite a lot <span style="color:red" data-ts="473.08" data-end_ts="473.23" title="473.08" id=c_"473.08">__is__</span> Mike Mills who directed me in 20th century women and a number of other projects. And he's, he's a pretty good amateur musician, but he, has a very strange ear. So I'll be, <span style="color:red" data-ts="486.43" data-end_ts="486.55" title="486.43" id=c_"486.43">__and__</span> he, he's the guy that will sit right next to me and this to you as I'm writing things when he has to come up to do so, what he does, which drives me nuts is, all right. Something, let's say, let's say it's a piano piece and it's kind of somewhat interesting except it has one particular cool melodic gesture. Let's say he will love it except for the one. Cool. Melodics yesterday, take that out. So I ended up with, I ended up it's interesting. And then I'm forced to Nikita Higgins musically that I wouldn't otherwise make myself, like I w I would definitely like not take out that cool part, but the result is surprisingly really fascinating because I ended up with a finished composition, which is put together by choices. I wouldn't have otherwise made, but, but at the end of the day, <span style="color:red" data-ts="536.19" data-end_ts="536.46" title="536.19" id=c_"536.19">__somehow__</span> I have to make it all work. And by adhering to his ear, it works in an interesting way and a new way, fresh way. That's, you know, unlike anything I would normally do. And so, so certain doctors I work with where the music I write with them is different from any other music or anybody else. Cause I'm, I'm following their instincts and their biases and their prejudices. And, and I like that kind of collaboration a lot. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><i>Cool. So I, I already have about a million questions, but before we get burning into that, one of the things that's kind of a hallmark of the, of this podcast is talking to people about their beginning stories, how they got to be the artists that they are. And I'm particularly curious about yours again, because you do have to have this really broad range of knowledge of musicals study, but again, listening to your work, there's clearly some really well studied classical background in there as well. So I'm curious to know a little bit more about your background, you know, growing up, were you like a band kid or a piano lesson kid? How did you move into, into kind of the, doing the compositional thing? What was the thing that tipped you into composition versus performance? I'm curious about those, those kinds of stories. Could you fill me in a little bit on that? </i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Roger: </b>Sure. Well, that's going to go way back, but, there is an answer to your question. I've been a musician since I was a kid, I think, probably for about really like age nine or 10, it was clear that I was dedicated to be a musician and I was going to be a musician. And that was my thing. Then whenever it was a plan B you know, like I think like a lot of us, particularly in that, I got into, I started playing first instruments in school and I stay in that era. Cause I don't think the school music programs exist anymore. That got me into music. Sadly. I always loved music. I had an older sister with the great record collection. So I was listening to pretty advanced, like, you know, progressive rock and stuff like that when I was six or seven years old, first <span style="color:red" data-ts="669.8" data-end_ts="669.96" title="669.8" id=c_"669.8">__incident__</span> when I started to play, when I was in elementary school, which was the flute, I got pretty good at it right away. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Roger: </b>And, and like would kind of like right away, like within a few months of learning how to play this instrument, I started writing things down because there was supposed to be some notation, some notation paper at my house. <span style="color:red" data-ts="686.75" data-end_ts="686.87" title="686.75" id=c_"686.75">__And__</span> that was one reason. And I just assumed everybody did that. You know? We'll just like do some notes and then start writing down. Well, it turns out perhaps everybody didn't do that, but I was doing that at eight to 10. So, that led to, beginning some lessons on, in piano and <span style="color:red" data-ts="703.52" data-end_ts="703.9" title="703.52" id=c_"703.52">__encompassed__</span> in <span style="color:red" data-ts="704.3" data-end_ts="704.42" title="704.3" id=c_"704.3">__a__</span> composition from like, the guy down the street who played piano like that kind of teacher. But it turns out the guy down the street to piano was a tremendous, tremendous musician who, was a big influence on me. His name is Francis thumb. And I mentioned him because he was a, such a, a huge influence on, on my development. And as a musician, this is in San Diego, my hometown and Francis would teach me Beethoven and certain ski. And we hang out at his, at his house and listen to records and we'd listen to anything from like Stockhausen to Zappa, to, John Lennon and talk about music. It was just, a wide universe expanding experience to study with that guy for my formative years. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><i>Kind of what age range, what age range was this? I'm sorry, what age? </i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Roger: </b>12 to 12 to 15 or so. Wow. Okay. It's going to say this one. Last thing about Francis is his best pal was this young <span style="color:red" data-ts="762.81" data-end_ts="763.14" title="762.81" id=c_"762.81">__Cannell__</span> playing, a folk musician from San Diego who would hang out at my lessons, waiting for Francis to get done so they can go out and crowds. And, that was Tom waits before his first record even came out, <span style="color:red" data-ts="776.17" data-end_ts="776.27" title="776.17" id=c_"776.17">__that__</span> came out and he would, he would hang out at my piano lessons, by the way, just wanna finish the story about Francis is that, decades later when my own, nephew who listen to listen to <span style="color:red" data-ts="786.49" data-end_ts="786.74" title="786.49" id=c_"786.49">__anything__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="786.74" data-end_ts="786.83" title="786.74" id=c_"786.74">__that__</span> wanted to take lessons, you hooked him up with Francis. And so though that storyline continued, so he ended up being an influence on a number of them. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><i>That's so cool. That's amazing. But also it's really interesting to hear, of your, you kind of being able to get your ears opened when you're in that 12 to 15 year old range. I mean, so often people, you know, their, their first interaction with Stockhausen, for example, doesn't really take place until university. So you kind of got almost a, a jump on that whole, that whole edge of things. </i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Roger: </b>Yeah, I did. And that was, and I'm feeling fulfilled very fortunate to have that, but I was listening to everything, you know, I think a lot of musicians and young musicians do that, hopefully they do. I mean, I was listening to my <span style="color:red" data-ts="837.75" data-end_ts="838.11" title="837.75" id=c_"837.75">__parents__</span>, big band albums and, jazz records and, classical guitar stuff. And just any, anything that caught my interest and, you know, that sort of expansive hunger for all types of music, I think is a really ultimately pushed me to be in his thumb composer because, you get the chance, like we started this conversation, you get the chance to bounce around in different genres, different identities. If I was either a conventional recording artist or a classical type composer, I might not have the chance to write, say something in the style of 1970 9 cent <span style="color:red" data-ts="879.21" data-end_ts="879.48" title="879.21" id=c_"879.21">__pop__</span>. Right. But because it's like, well, why would I do that? Even though I, you know, even, well, I thought, why would you do that? But you could like, it just wouldn't come up, but the film composing you, you get to do that. You know, you get to put on these, these different, different guises and then that's kind of seemed like a great fit for me. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><i>So what was your, what was your education then once you went to university? Cause it sounds to me like you have a, I mean, you mentioned that you have this kind of very classical music education. What, what did that look like? </i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Roger: </b>Well, yeah, you know, when I was, when I was a young, younger kid, I was playing classical music. I was playing in new symphonies, but then when I reached adolescence, I realized, playing the flute really wasn't gonna get me any dates. So I started playing guitar, you know, most guys join bands to try to get a date. And usually it doesn't work out, but they get into a band anyway. At least that was my case, you know, like around age 12 or so, I started playing guitar and got good enough to gig. You know, I was a good rock. Musician is good classical musician, good enough, not great, but good enough. Eventually I wanted to go to college and studying music and I realized that, or acknowledged the flute was still my strongest instrument. I was still most position on that. So I applied to a number of music schools and got accepted to USC as a flute player. I got there and found out I was one of about 43 flute players in the school. And I was about the 41st best flute player. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Roger: </b>But what I was really good at with my theory class. So my, my theory teacher said, you're their own department, come join composition. They made a positioning <span style="color:red" data-ts="987.88" data-end_ts="987.97" title="987.88" id=c_"987.88">__that__</span> a place sent me there. And I studied composition at USC, which worked out great. And, and I felt like I kept on that path. I got my composition degree from them. Then a chance meeting with a professor at Harvard. This is what the Aspen school of music. We spent a summer there and I met this Harvard professor who liked my music. And just out of the blue said, what are you doing next year? <span style="color:red" data-ts="1011.65" data-end_ts="1012.23" title="1011.65" id=c_"1011.65">__Know__</span>, not that I'm finishing up USC. I have no idea. He said, well, come to Harvard. That was my application process. So I got accepted to Harvard graduate school, easiest thing in the world. I mean, I just fell in my lap. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Roger: </b>I really had no intention of going to school. I just like, you know, you're a musician with a degree and no, no real marketable skills. So I thought, well, sure, better than a typist. So yeah, so I got, I, I went the whole, whole journey on that and, got a PhD in music composition from Harvard. And that was in some respects, the trajectory I was on, I was kind of thinking I probably ended up being a professor. However, I was, I was already writing film scores. I'd done stuff at USC as a, as a student. And one of my, pals at USC was a filmmaker ended up making his first film feature film, which I scored while I was living in Cambridge using musicians. We recorded the score in a dining hall at Harvard. So I was already interested in that. But what happened, what really got me into being a composer that works for living is, is this when I was in grad school, I started to realize that I could apply for grants and fellowships and things and probably get them because, you know, you get this credential of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1094.16" data-end_ts="1094.25" title="1094.16" id=c_"1094.16">__this__</span> Harvard credential that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1095.03" data-end_ts="1095.15" title="1095.03" id=c_"1095.03">__is__</span> kind of like for <span style="color:red" data-ts="1095.69" data-end_ts="1095.78" title="1095.69" id=c_"1095.69">__us__</span>, the way that's going to <span style="color:red" data-ts="1096.53" data-end_ts="1096.77" title="1096.53" id=c_"1096.53">__spit__</span> before anything is for that. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><i>Right </i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Roger: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1102.79" data-end_ts="1102.97" title="1102.79" id=c_"1102.79">__Way__</span> it works pretty well. So I applied for the new fellowship out of BMI BMI, the performing, performing rights organization, right. And it was called the Pete carpenter fellowship and was a fellowship designed to bring conservatory or non Hollywood, young composers to Hollywood to learn about the film music business and the film music business to learn about them. So I received, I applied for and received this fellowship. I think I was the second person to get it. And it's still in existence today being my, still offers this fellowship. So I got this thing and I, left school for six weeks and came out to Los Angeles and, worked with a bunch of different composers I work with and just like looked over at the shoulders of a bunch of different composers. Michael came in Quincy Jones, Martin with his <span style="color:red" data-ts="1153.31" data-end_ts="1153.85" title="1153.31" id=c_"1153.31">__Boston__</span> terrific people. And this, the sponsor of this fellowship is the TB composer. Mike post. He set it up actually in honor of his late partner, if he could be carpenter. So through this, I got to know Mike really well. And, he liked me and basically said, so when you're done with Harvard, what are you doing next? I said, I don't know. You know, why do you ask? And he offered me a job to come work with him. So that's how, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1183.58" data-end_ts="1183.73" title="1183.58" id=c_"1183.58">__it__</span> was my conviction to work in Hollywood. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><i>That is so interesting, but it also, you know, it, it helps me understand a little bit about how that mechanism works. I mean, it's, it's really, every time I talk to somebody who's, who's sort of like makes a, makes a career in Hollywood, all it always has that kind of feeling to it. Like, you know, I was, I was studying, I was working hard. I happened to find myself in LA working with X and we hit it off and that became, in, and that's how I kind of got started in the business. Right. It, it seems like sort of this kind of personal connection is really one of the hallmarks. What, what, breaks things open for people working in Hollywood? I mean, beyond yourself, is that sort of something that you tend to see in, in general in the case of film composition? Yeah. </i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Roger: </b>Yeah. I think about this quite a lot because I have younger composers who find me and seek me out and send some of who become, I become a mentor for. And we, you know, I do a lot of advising on, on some career how to develop a career. And, first thing I usually say is don't follow my example. Cause mine was just, I just, I just <span style="color:red" data-ts="1270.75" data-end_ts="1270.9" title="1270.75" id=c_"1270.75">__kinda__</span> fell on my lap. I didn't do anything. It's just like, you know, a little glib, but not really, you know, one thing I have found to be true for a lot of people and not just in music, but in all sorts of fields is the people who ended up being important to you, to helping you get your start, helping you do your first, you know, first important projects are not, it's not like you break into Hollywood and meet these famous people. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Roger: </b>The people you end up being important to you have the people you already know for the most part, like people that you've grown up with, perhaps even if you grew up nowhere. And I grew up in San Diego, which, you know, how far is Hollywood is concerned is nowhere. Right. But a lot of people who I just sort of like came up with and spent my childhood with ended up being super important to, opportunities that came my way later. And, some, some cases, it became collaborators with me in some cases, just people who, helped me find other people that were important to me. I say this because I think I find this to be true. And I think it's, it's turned out to be valuable to people who I've, shared this information with, because it can be really daunting as a young composer, trying to figure out how to get a toehold, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Roger: </b>You know, in the business. And again, it's not a matter of like, how can I meet this other person and how can I meet, you know, so, and so famous director or whatever they're trying to do. That's not where you <span style="color:red" data-ts="1357" data-end_ts="1357.12" title="1357" id=c_"1357">__feel__</span>. You're going to start, crew's going to start with like the guys, you already know people, you already know, hopefully one of them might want to be a filmmaker or something, or maybe your, you know, relative knows somebody who knows somebody, you know, somebody who needs music for something. Right. That, that more often than not is the way that this, I think that people get those important first opportunities. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><i>Well, and also this idea of people, you know, I mean, you say that you came from, San Diego, which is sort of like Hollywood, nowhere, but also, I mean, you studied at USC and in fact, it's kind of funny that you were at USC and then book that all the way over to Massachusetts to eventually get the opportunity to come back to Lausanne. It's kind of interesting, but I mean, in your time in USC, did you build up kind of connections with people that ended up becoming important </i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Roger: </b>Honestly, less than you might think really that's wild. I mean, I will say that USC school of music is just outstanding. So that was great. You know, I, I learned more practical skills there than anywhere, including Harvard in a way, Harvard is, is a deeper dive into, you know, academic studies and music. And I loved it. I loved it for itself. I loved it. It's just endeavoring it's in his home. But when I, once I started working as a film composer, I kind of realized this is a little little glib, but I think it's true. I kind of realized that I already had all the skills at about age 17 that I needed to do this film composing thing. Everything else was just a Grady. So USC ended up not being a place where I met lots of people who ended up being important, career connections. I just learned, I just met lots of great musicians who helped me, become, you know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><i>Yeah, no, I'm, I'm curious, when you moved out to LA and you started, working, you know, kind of in a mentee role with, with Mike post in some way, what is, what are the things that he taught you or the group of people surrounding him taught you that, proved to be valuable in kind of turning this from a cool opportunity into a career? Because that must, I mean, you, obviously, you obviously, it obviously worked out for you, so you must have like gotten some good, good hints out of that first experience. </i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Roger: </b>Well, yeah. And Mike meeting Mike was a great, good fortune for me. And he's a, he's a super guy and we're still friends to this day when he offered me that job, to come work with him, neither, he nor I really knew what that job would be. He just thought, you know, maybe this Roger Guy has something going on. And, when I, when I arrived at his, at his studio and started working the first few weeks, he was, he realized I had a pretty firm background in like a bit him computers and nitty and, and electronic music. And a lot of this was new. This was, we're talking about the mid nineties. So this was sort of a fairly new technology. And the fact that I knew this stuff would ended up being surprisingly valuable to him. He had no idea what happened to Mike shop. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Roger: </b>It's introduced to engineering. These, he has this, he was super busy with like five, six different TV series. And he got one of his main producers. His Palestinian <span style="color:red" data-ts="1568.47" data-end_ts="1568.89" title="1568.47" id=c_"1568.47">__cattle__</span> had one late night action series that Mike did not want a score. He thought it was crappy. And, but he took the job and gave it to, to me and his other assistant Danny <span style="color:red" data-ts="1580.32" data-end_ts="1580.68" title="1580.32" id=c_"1580.32">__Luxe__</span> to score was a TV series called silk stockings. And so Danny and I are scoring, scoring this series. This is really like two weeks after I arrived in Los Angeles. I'm scoring a TV series with my name on the, on the screen, me and daddy's name on the screen. It just like <span style="color:red" data-ts="1598.49" data-end_ts="1598.58" title="1598.49" id=c_"1598.49">__this__</span> just like fell on my lap. It was so simple, which is why I tell people don't follow my example, what happened, but they happened to answer your question about Mike that's so valuable is really part of the learning process for some composers is not, it's not so much like the notes you choose or how to write music with Mike. It was two things how to understand storytelling, which is a really intricate craft in itself. And also simply how to run a business as a, as an artist and specifically how to, interact with your collaborative clients and foster those relationships, and just be part of a team of, filmmakers or TV show makers. You're part of this greater idea and just how to be, how to be, how to fulfill your role in a way that's really valuable. Those are some of the things I learned, from those early years. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><i>Well, I would like to know a little bit more of those because they're, those are both like really intriguing things, but they're both kind of different qualities of like the creative pursuit. Right. So, let's start off. First of all, what the storytelling, what, what exactly do you mean by storytelling when it comes to film scoring? What, what exactly are you, are you kind of talking about, </i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Roger: </b>Why is the music there? We can start with that when you kind of think about it, why does film music exist at all? It seems fairly arbitrary. Like why, why is there music going on while we're flying the spaceship through, you know, an asteroid belt? I mean, it, it works, but it seems like, kind of, you know, why is this orchestral music playing? Well, hopefully it's there because it helps, it helps enhance the story. It helps it, it makes it more vivid. It tells something that otherwise wouldn't be, part of the experience for the audience. And, specifically like you can get us this fixed, like you can enhance like the moments, like when are we in parallel? When is their release of that Pearl? When, when are we winning? When are we losing, what does that, what does that little crook of his, I mean, at that point, these are all stuff that can be really sort of defined and enhanced by the music in ways that even, I think, some music aficionados don't always really appreciate, like how intricate it all works when I'm working on a new score for a film, it really is a part of the process for me is really trying to figure out who the characters are. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Roger: </b>What makes them tick? What <span style="color:red" data-ts="1750.31" data-end_ts="1750.4" title="1750.31" id=c_"1750.31">__is__</span>, what's their journey? What do they know now <span style="color:red" data-ts="1754" data-end_ts="1754.15" title="1754" id=c_"1754">__that__</span> don't know later when they learned this thing and you know, how, how do they evolve? How does this character relate to that character? Because that's going to definitely determine what kind of music I write for these two people. If they were together in the same scene, there might be an, a power dynamic that needs to be, acknowledged in some way. So these, like, I'll be kind of intricacies about the storytelling become super important to my, to my musical choices. Right. And that be just like the, the fun thing when I'm talking with my directors and the people I'm working with to get into that, let's not talk about whether it's a B flight, whether it's on a bassoon, let's talk about, you know, what is she thinking right here? What is, what's your thought process at this moment? And then 10 seconds later, what, what's different. That's helpful. That's interesting for me as a composer, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><i>That's, that's so cool. And that's, it really kind of like breaks away from, so much of what I think people imagine is the art, you know, the quote art of, film composing, which is like, you know, I think a lot of people get overly impressed by like the orchestration or maybe the, you know, the, the complexity or the, the, you know, what kind of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1831.11" data-end_ts="1831.62" title="1831.11" id=c_"1831.11">__chordal__</span> movement there is. And really what you're saying is look at the screen. What, how can you enhance what's on the screen so that the story is told in a more, well, you use the word vivid it, how can the story be told in a more vivid way? And that, that really seems to be a very interesting approach to take. </i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Roger: </b>Yeah. You know, you have to justify your existence too. So, as, as a composer, why am I even here? Right. And I'll tell you, what's really, really gratifying when you play something in a piece you've written for your director and their story becomes more vivid for them, you know, and they just like, or they're moved by it, or they're delighted by it. That's, that's really gratifying, you know? Cause you feel like now I've, justified my existence. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><i>Right? Sure. That makes a lot of sense. Now, the other thing that you mentioned that, that Mike kind of taught you was the, how to run the business aspect of it. And I think that this is something that's really important because a lot of times when you, especially when I talk to people who are just kind of getting started in the business or whatever, they're confronted with a lot of business questions that their time at Berkeley or their time at Cal arts or their time at Harvard or wherever, didn't prepare them to ask like, you know, Hey, are you gonna, you know, can you work, work on this for free for quote exposure, right? Or, you know, you're going to go straight for somebody else because that's what we need to do in order to get the funding for a job or something like that. How much of that, kind of came into play and, and what were like the warning tracks that, that might've been, illuminated for you? </i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Roger: </b>First of all, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1945.35" data-end_ts="1945.62" title="1945.35" id=c_"1945.35">__he's__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1945.62" data-end_ts="1945.92" title="1945.62" id=c_"1945.62">__already__</span> talking about business side. I'm not simply talking about how to enhance your money flow, but also just much broader things like how to foster a career, how to, manage your factories, which are outputting your, your work in a way that you know, where you're dependable and, and, it's, it's good quality and I'll pull these other factors. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1967.27" data-end_ts="1967.36" title="1967.27" id=c_"1967.27">__It's__</span> just, you know, like in any other shock you might be, I might be running right. My custom upholstery shop or whatever I've ever might be metal working or whatever. Yeah, sure. You know, as you've learned, I spent a lot of time at conservatory. So I feel like the conservative conservatories generally do a poor job of training their students in how to make a career happen. And I think that's a disservice, a real disservice in the teaching. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Roger: </b>I do. I'm cognizant of that. And I really try to, to push against that because first of all, it's, if you're responsible to teach people about music and not teach them how to make a career happen with them music, but also I think from younger musicians who feel somewhat idealistic, they might think business is adding the ethical to, to music, but it's not in so far as when I studied the, the lives of whether it's famous composers or even famous pop stars, their lives are also the choices. Artistic choices are rooted to their desire to make a name for themselves and to do their work. Beethoven was a fine business person and he would plan his own concerts and sell subscription tickets himself sometimes at the door and write to particular pieces for a particular concert in order to make money from self you'd be in charge of the advertising. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Roger: </b>People aren't really aware of this, I think, but absolutely true. The Bach Brandenburg concertos were written as a demo for <span style="color:red" data-ts="2061.11" data-end_ts="2061.41" title="2061.11" id=c_"2061.11">__Bach__</span> to get a gig with Frederick. The great, there are demos to get a job, which is what you did not get. But thank God we got the demos because they're families. So even things like that, even something, this is, I think also this is a left turn, but Keith Richard, when you wrote satisfaction, he filled with that great fuzz, bass guitar part <span style="color:red" data-ts="2082.92" data-end_ts="2085.74" title="2082.92" id=c_"2082.92">__***<inaudible>***__</span>, which he played on the fuzz guitar because he really wanted a horn section, but they didn't have the bucks for it. So we find a way to, to make it work with what they <span style="color:red" data-ts="2096.03" data-end_ts="2096.39" title="2096.03" id=c_"2096.03">__researched__</span> that they had as a business decision. I mean, what a less good song satisfaction would be if that wasn't 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><i><span style="color:red" data-ts="2103.13" data-end_ts="2103.61" title="2103.13" id=c_"2103.13">__Section__</span>, right? No kidding. That's </i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Roger: </b>I don't know. So it's just, these are some of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2109.13" data-end_ts="2109.19" title="2109.13" id=c_"2109.13">__the__</span> stuff that you learn along the way, like how to make it all work. And sometimes you also learned that your limitations end up being the things that send you in a really good journey somewhere 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><i>Right now. One of the things I want I'm really, I wanted to explore a little further with something that you said, which is that, one of the things that's, that's neat about doing film, being a film composer is that it actually lets you explore musical styles. You probably wouldn't be able to do if you were a, you know, quote recording musician. And I think that this is, you know, it's something that for people who want, who love a lot of different kinds of music, it actually is a conundrum. You know, it's like a, you know, Hey, I'm known for doing ambient music, but I really like being on an MPC drum machine and doing beats, but nobody wants to hear my beats. Right. Everyone wants to hear my ambient music, where you have the opportunity. You know, it's funny, I was listening to different things and like, the 20th century movie, I I'm terrible <span style="color:red" data-ts="2176.65" data-end_ts="2176.78" title="2176.65" id=c_"2176.65">__at__</span> 20th century woman in 20th century woman. </i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><i>I mean, you did all of these kind of like gauzy synthy tracks, which were just like, I mean, kind of really sounded of an era. And then, you know, a bunch of stuff that you did for, Valley girl kind of had, more of this like really poppy thing. But then I ran across something called the Beasley bombing, which is, which is like almost a vaudevillian in nature. In some cases you've got some stuff where it's like solo, piano, other stuff where it's outright jazz, it must be kind of, it must be kind of fun, I guess, to be able to like dig into a genre and there's just really express yourself, you know, kind of temporarily, right. </i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Roger: </b>Wow. You found the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2227.04" data-end_ts="2227.37" title="2227.04" id=c_"2227.04">__BC__</span> bombing. So <span style="color:red" data-ts="2229.32" data-end_ts="2229.56" title="2229.32" id=c_"2229.32">__that__</span> for you, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><i>That was, that was funny because that was something, when I saw it, I was like, wow, this is a very polarizing piece because it seemed like people either absolutely loved it. I think he went to an award for that, right? </i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Roger: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><i>They, they just wanted to crucify you for it. So it's pretty interesting thing. </i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Roger: </b>You'd like those people a lot, that would potentially try to ride it. It's an opera, it's a musical and it was musically stylistic. It we're trying to be in the style of Gilbert and Sullivan, late 19th century British operettas. But the story has to do with white supremacists and Al Qaeda terrorists and, and a bunch of hi-jinks and, and, the destruction of the country with nuclear bombs and, and it's all good fun. So, but that, but that, I mean, thank you for mentioning that, because that does sort of illustrate my point. I really was given a chance to write music in the style of Gilbert and Sullivan, which when would that otherwise come around? Right. You know, so I can wake up one morning thinking <span style="color:red" data-ts="2295.59" data-end_ts="2295.71" title="2295.59" id=c_"2295.59">__this__</span> thinking, right? I'm going to write something that could have found it's going to sound like the pirates of Penzance. No, not unless they have a reason to. And I found a reason. I have my friend of mine, a very talented writer, Julian Pittsburgh, who wrote this, had this concept for a musical needs. He brought it to me and I said, yeah, I'm on board. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2313.41" data-end_ts="2313.53" title="2313.41" id=c_"2313.41">__So__</span> wrote this thing. And it's like, it's in this very specific genre style. And, and then for that, you know, as I was writing that, I took on that character of that composer who would write this style. And that was fun. I'm sorry. You had a question somewhere. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><i><span style="color:red" data-ts="2329.68" data-end_ts="2329.73" title="2329.68" id=c_"2329.68">__It__</span> was just like all of a sudden took a left turn into doing a Gilbert and Sullivan piece, which is like pretty fascinating. So unfortunately our time is up already, but before I let you go, I am curious what is a thing that you haven't gotten a chance to do that you really want to do? I mean, do you want to do a score that is in the style of Drake or is there something that you're like really dying to do that you haven't done yet? </i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Roger: </b>Wow, good question. I'll try to answer this way. I love it. When people ask me to write music that I have no idea how to write. So whether it's threat like Drake or to write like, Indonesian folk music, I'm up for that challenge. That's super fun. But also I think, the classroom position of me, I think like nothing more than when I'm in front of an orchestra scoring stage big, giant dot orchestra, conducting that glorious sound. I've done that, but I just liked doing that and want to do more of it. And that's really in some ways, but then Nicole, I think of when I feel like I'm doing my crew to the fullest and I'm doing these big orchestral scores and people come to recording session 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><i>Right on, what do you have coming up that people can look forward to checking out </i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Roger: </b>I'm working at two films now. I don't know when they're released. One is called unpregnant and it's for HBO max. It's the same director that directed Valley girl, Rachel Goldenberg. And she's going to come to the studio in about 10 minutes to listen to my latest fuse. That'll come out sometime next few months. Another film called Alex October, which is a independent drama. And I don't know where that'll come out, but both probably be out sometime later this year, early 20, 21. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><i>That's fantastic. And one last thing, you mentioned that, you actually said, you know, the teaching, I do dot.dot. What kind of, what kind of teaching do you do? How do you, how do you kind of fulfill that part of your interests </i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Roger: </b>Teaching? I was teaching at UCLA and teaching at Cal poly Pomona at certain points in my life. No, not at the moment. As I kind of teach and then I kind of get tired of it and have to be recharged and come back. But I do, I do this one thing, which is a, every summer, there's a, a workshop I teach called the Palomar film music workshop, myself and my colleague Larry group. Hey, it's a nine day workshop in San Diego County, San Diego, San Diego County. And I know <span style="color:red" data-ts="2487.33" data-end_ts="2487.45" title="2487.33" id=c_"2487.33">__I'm__</span> film scoring and that's, that's my regular thing. I love doing that every year. I usually do at this time of year in, unfortunately we're taking this year off. Yeah. It'll be <span style="color:red" data-ts="2498" data-end_ts="2498.27" title="2498" id=c_"2498">__Brown__</span> for next year. So that's, that's what that is. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><i>It sounds fantastic. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2502.19" data-end_ts="2502.31" title="2502.19" id=c_"2502.19">__Or__</span> Roger, I want to thank you so much for taking the time to have this chat, taking time out of your schedule and for just kind of filling us in on the work that you do and how you approach it. I really appreciate it. </i>
</p>

<p>
