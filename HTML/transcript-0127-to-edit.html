<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today I have the, pleasure of being able to talk to someone that was introduced to me by Andrew Benson, who we interviewed just a few weeks ago. His name is Johnny Woods and he has many different hats that he wears. One of 'em is that he is a, he's part of the label running system of Undervolt and Company, which, was the, the video label that Andrew works with. And, it also obviously carries Johnny's work as well, and, and some amazing animation work. It is, he does, a very peculiar and very stylistically strong, kind of animation work for himself, but he also has got a lot of other stuff going. So rather than me trying to enumerate everything, let's first of all say hi to Johnny. Hi, Johnny. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny Woods: </b>I'm good. How are you doing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm all right. Thanks a lot for taking time outta your schedule to talk to me. Oh, it's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>A pleasure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Why don't we start off by having you start, identify yourself, rather than me trying to say, read your bio. Why don't you tell me how you think of yourself? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>I do a lot of different, I, I'm, I'm restless. I've always been restless. And I've had, I've had a lot of really cool opportunities to do a lot of different stuff, but I, I haven't, it hasn't been a straight line for me. So, I mean, I guess going from now and working backwards, you know, I'm, I'm current. I've, I've had my first full-time job that I've had in, 36 years on this Earth now. And I make, you know, it's nothing that I would ever do as an artist, but I find it, I worked for Buzzfeed and I find it just fascinating. But going back from there, about only about four years ago, I started doing, animation. And that, that came out of a few <span style="color:red" data-ts="136.365" data-end_ts="136.565" title="136.365" id=c_"136.365">__years__</span>, you know, for the five or six years before that, I was, doing video art and, doing music videos and, and freelance video work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>And I just finally hit this point where it's just, it's frustrating to make videos when, when you have kind of a more unusual vision for things, you need to rally up a lot of people. So, and, and you need to rally up a lot of resources to make a video. Sure. So when I realized that you could do this thing just by sitting at a desk by yourself in your underwear and, and make an entire film, that was kind of a, a big moment for me. So it, it coincided actually, right when I moved to Los Angeles from New York. I sort of dove into doing animation pretty much full time. But never really, I've always had a complicated relationship with, like, calling myself an artist. I mean, I guess I call myself whatever fits the context that I'm working in at the time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>So, right. If I am asked to do something for a gallery or to do a performance or something along those lines, I'll call myself an artist. But if I'm asked to show something in a film festival or a screening, I'll call myself a filmmaker or a director or whatever. But for me, it's always just been, I just really like making stuff more than, more than anything else, and Right. Any opportunity I have to make something, I will, I will jump on it. And it's kind of, it's difficult to, to build a, a definable career that way. Right. But, but it's been a great, it's been great fun and, and a great adventure. So yeah, that's, I'm, I'm clearly very bad at defining myself <laugh>, so, so that's what you get. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's, it's interesting though, because you have a really varied set of things you do, so it would make sense that you, that defining yourself's a little, a little troubling. Also, it seems to me like the work of doing animation is actually a hard to define role because unlike almost any other discipline, you really have to sort of manage 20 jobs at once. You really are a director and a script writer and a director of photography, and you're all of these things because it sort of sits on your lap. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>Yeah. And I think that's also the, you know, like a, a constant topic, amongst me and, and, other people I know who work the way that I do is like, what, what we're doing is unheard of in any kind of commercial world or, or in the industry at large. Like, if you tell people you're an animator, the first thing they ask you is, oh, what studio do you work for? And, when you say like, oh, I, I, I just make them myself, people look at you like you're crazy. Right. Especially out here in La <laugh>. Or they assume you're just like a grad student, you know, finishing your thesis film or whatever. But, so it's, it's kind of this weird little world of people doing this stuff because it is, it is not common. And I, I don't think it's because we're like some kind of superheroes who can manage these, you know, 20 different tasks at once. I think it's just because we have really stubborn visions, <laugh>, and, and we don't mind sacrificing some parts of the technical process in order to, to have that kind of control over creating something. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, that's actually what I was going <span style="color:red" data-ts="358.925" data-end_ts="359.005" title="358.925" id=c_"358.925">__to__</span> ask was to, was what extent, I mean, you used the word stubborn, which is probably actually the best word to use, but, <laugh>. Yeah. You know, it's, it, it does seem like most of the people I know that do this kind of work, and I don't know that many, but everyone that I know are like, kind of control freaks. I, I hate to like lay that label on your head, but it just seems like there's something that says, you know, I can do it and therefore I don't have to depend on other people. So therefore that's, that's where I'm stake in my claim. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>Yeah. I think that's part of it. I mean, my, my problem has always been that, I'm, I'm too nice, so I wish I was more of a controlled freak, but, my, my biggest problem when I was trying to make live action videos was I never felt comfortable, like asking people to work for free or asking people to work really long hours or like pulling in favors from people. And to me, that was always the big stumbling block. And with, with animation, it was like, oh, cool. I don't have to ask anybody to do any, I can just, I can, I, I can make like the personal sacrifices to do this myself. And if it, and, actually, you know, there's like a lot of technical things I wish I could bring people in to do better for me. Right. And when I have the budgets for projects, I'm, that's always the first thing I do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>I'm like, oh, cool. I can handle like, like, like, like I can hire like Andrew, who I have recently hired to work on a big project Mm-Hmm. That I had. 'cause he's better at certain things than I am. So, but I, I think where the control thing comes in is that if I was making things with a team of people instead of just by myself, then money has to be involved somehow, and that money has to come from somewhere. Right. And that's the, that's the control part that for me, I was trying to avoid was if someone else is paying for this, then I'm not gonna get to do what I want to do with it. So, right. I have to find a way to make it happen all by myself. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's actually, that's a interesting point, and one that I think a lot of people don't think about, regardless of what the context, whether you're being commissioned for a work by a gallery, or you're being commissioned for work by a advertising group or a band that wants to do a video or whatever art you're being <span style="color:red" data-ts="519.165" data-end_ts="519.385" title="519.165" id=c_"519.165">__do__</span>, you're doing when you're doing, when someone else is footing the bill, they're the people that get to set the expectations and they're to get people who get to pull the trigger and say, something's done. And I don't know about you, but for me, one of the most frustrating things in the world is when somebody else tells me that a thing is done and I don't yet feel like it's done. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>Yep. Yep. Absolutely. And I mean, the, the thing for for me has always been that, you know, when you, when you make, when you make work as an artist, you're trying to communicate something successfully. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And when you create something that you feel is communicating successfully and someone else tells you it's not, and you need to change it, or someone else stops you before you get to that point, that to me was always really frustrating. Like, you know, you're just like, but, but, but it's, it's missing the point, you know? And they're like, oh, but it's fine. And you're just sad. So, but there's good, you know, there's, there's, I've had as many good experiences that had bad, in terms of working with commission projects. So they're not all, it's not necessarily a bad thing. It can actually be a really great thing if you're working with the right people who want what you're doing for the right reasons. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>Right. And I think that's actually more rare. And, and I think a part of it is just that we don't meet people in person. <span style="color:red" data-ts="612.405" data-end_ts="612.695" title="612.405" id=c_"612.405">__This__</span>, this might be going off onto a slightly different topic, but, all, all the good commissions that I've gotten have been from people who eventually I became friends with or, or people who I was friends with before. And I think this goes for collaborators as well, <span style="color:red" data-ts="629.315" data-end_ts="629.535" title="629.315" id=c_"629.315">__is__</span> that it's kind of like, it's really easy to misinterpret what somebody is saying if you, if you've only been exposed to their work online. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>And I always find that when I meet artists whose work I like in person for the first time, sometimes I meet people and I'm like, oh my God, you're exactly like your work. That's amazing. <laugh>. You know, and, and sometimes you meet people and you're like, oh. But it always gives you this window into what their work is really about. Right. That I don't think you necessarily get by just kind of surface browsing. Sure. And I think that's a big problem when it comes to commissioned work. People will see something that like I do online and they <span style="color:red" data-ts="668.725" data-end_ts="669.015" title="668.725" id=c_"668.725">__miss__</span>, they don't understand what it's actually about. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>And they are then asking for something based on their misunderstanding of what it is. And when I give them what I'm capable of doing, they're like, oh, but that's not what I wanted. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Oh 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>Man. You know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Yeah. It's, it, it seems like the virtual life is so rife with misinterpretation of all sorts. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, <span style="color:red" data-ts="696.635" data-end_ts="696.855" title="696.635" id=c_"696.635">__yep__</span>. That's a, that's a really good point, example. So, I am always curious when I meet, particular, particularly artists that do stuff that's unfathomable to me. And, and believe me, I look at your work and, and it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="713.165" data-end_ts="713.205" title="713.165" id=c_"713.165">__is__</span> really hard for me to, to imagine a person doing it, you know, which is always, that's exciting for me. Yeah. Yeah. It's exciting because then there's like a lot of magic tied into it. Right. But I'm curious about what your background is and how you got where you are today because it's, you know, given, given the quality and type of your work. I am, I'm expecting that there's an interesting story there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>It's not as interesting as you would <laugh>. Well, okay. There is actually one interesting, there's one interesting part of this, and I've actually never said this publicly out loud before. So, so I'll, I'll give you this fun tidbit. But, I just, I went to, I went to school for art, but not in any technical way. And, you know, I was, I was always, I always liked computers. I was always good at computers. And actually when I was younger, I was much, much more involved in music Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> than I was in art. But going to school for art seemed like a great way to also be able to make music <laugh>. Which I think is a pretty common thing. Right. But I got out of grad school, and I was doing, I was doing video work, but nothing close to what I was doing now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>I was doing, basically like what you would consider BJ stuff, but I was doing it in the context of a <span style="color:red" data-ts="806.725" data-end_ts="806.945" title="806.725" id=c_"806.725">__art__</span> context for trying to, I wasn't doing it very successfully, but doing a lot of things with video feedback and with compositing. And that led me into working a lot with after effects and different things. And right before I graduated from school, I, I got a call from a college in the area that was looking for someone to teach, like visual effects compositing. Okay. And I guess they were like really desperately searching. So they interviewed me, they asked me a whole bunch of questions I knew the answers to. I, I, I was able to explain the answers well enough to where they offered me the job. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, to teach like high-end visual effects software that I had never even heard of, let alone know how to use <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>But of course, I, I took the job and then I just crammed, you know? And then it was almost like, it was almost like my second education. Sure. I taught at the school for about almost four years. And from teaching compositing classes, I moved to teaching some 3D classes. And that's where I learned Maya, just because they didn't have anyone else to teach it. So I was like, well, better learn Maya now. Right. But the interesting thing was that I wasn't, it wasn't until I quit that job that I actually started using those tools creatively. Oh yeah. It was like, because that whole process every week, I was kind of like cramming so that I could learn enough to teach my students. Right. And, and I was doing it in very specific examples, you know, it was like mostly visual effects leaning. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>But I learned so much in such a short time because the great thing about teaching is that you get to learn from all of your students' mistakes as well as your own <laugh>. So if, you know, if you have like 60 students in a semester, you are getting 60 times the mistakes. And I think that was, that was like a huge benefit, having that kind of experience. And I still talk to quite a few of my students and I hope none of them hear this. 'cause they'll be like, I knew it, you know, or whatever. But it was, you know, I was, I was teaching for a long time and then I decided that I didn't want to teach anymore because I wanted to do some stuff. And that's when I moved to Los Angeles. And right when it happened, I was like, it was a friend of mine, my friend, Jerome, he was, well, he makes music and he is actually just become widely successful, producing beats for Kanye West and, and whatnot. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>But, he asked me if I would do a music video for him, when I first moved to LA and he had been doing this stuff where he was like, re-editing old, like eighties and nineties, bad cg. Right. And all of his music videos were just like re-edited references of those things. Okay. And I was watching these videos and I just told him, I was like, you know, I could probably just make that. And he got really excited about that. So we actually worked together on what was my first proper animation I ever did. And I made it over a very heavily mistake filled month <laugh>, basically the, the month I moved to LA Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And then after I did that one, I was just like, this is amazing. And the last four years I just worked really, really hard on it. Picked up a lot of tricks. I really think you learn from doing stuff. I, I, at least I do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I absolutely agree. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>And the, the usual process for animation is so antithetical to actually doing animation. And I never, I never took that route. I would rather, like, I don't do storyboards for anything. 'cause I could use that time to actually animate stuff. Right, right. You know? And, so I tend to just dive into things and, and as a result, I've just made like, just a ton of minutes of animation <laugh> over the last four years. And that's, that's how I think you just pick up a little, every time you make something, you pick up a couple little new tricks, you know? So it was, it was far from me just sitting down one day and being like, oh, I got this. You know? Right. It's still like, I'm still learning all these new, all these new things every day. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I also think it's interesting that, that, you know, you had this experience of like, cramming for teaching, but also that it didn't really become artful to you until you left teaching. I can't tell you the number of people that I talk to that, that basically say that, you know, when they, if they're teaching the thing that is their art, it becomes very hard to, at the end of the day, do art. It's just you're exhausted about it Absolutely. By then. Right. Yep. And so it actually, it's better if you teach something that just isn't connected at all with what you wanna do. Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b><affirmative> No, absolutely. Just don't teach at all, which has been my, my recent strategy, which has worked out great. Has 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Because I'm about to take that, take that approach. I've been teaching part-time at a, at a art school here locally. We just decided that as a family, we're gonna pick up and we're gonna move across the country. And, as part of that, I am going to stop teaching for a while and go back to the wood shed and try and to do some art again. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I don't <span style="color:red" data-ts="1164.485" data-end_ts="1164.525" title="1164.485" id=c_"1164.485">__know__</span> how that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1164.945" data-end_ts="1165.165" title="1164.945" id=c_"1164.945">__go__</span>. I mean, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>You know, the thing that I, the thing that happened to me, I mean, I think there were two things that made it really hard. Thing number one was you had to like, like when you're teaching, there's different ways of teaching, but especially when you're teaching in a technical subject. I, I teach my students the right way to do things, you know? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and the, the theory behind things, and we're showing examples that are like the highest end version of the work that they're trying to do. Right. And then you get home to work on your own stuff. And all of that is still there, <laugh> when, as you know, if you're like, actually a working artist, you don't do anything the right way. You don't have to anymore. 'cause you Right. You know, you learned how to do it the right way. And then you're like, okay, now I can do it my way. Right. Informed by the right way. But I was always maybe a little too preoccupied with like, what my students would think of it. Or like, am I breaking my own rules that I'm giving to them? Or am I, you know, that that burden for me was really tough. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>And then I think the other thing for me was just, I started teaching when I was really young, and I would see all my students graduate college and go on and like, do cool things. And I was just like, man, I should have done cool things, <laugh>, I should <span style="color:red" data-ts="1248.525" data-end_ts="1248.645" title="1248.525" id=c_"1248.525">__have__</span>, what am I doing here? I'm just <span style="color:red" data-ts="1250.325" data-end_ts="1250.525" title="1250.325" id=c_"1250.325">__like__</span>, they're all, they're all flying off and I'm just like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1253.075" data-end_ts="1253.365" title="1253.075" id=c_"1253.075">__here__</span>, you know, still here. But it was, like I literally had to move across country to stop though, because Sure. At the same time, teaching's a great job. It's, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1266.905" data-end_ts="1267.125" title="1266.905" id=c_"1266.905">__but__</span> both in terms of just like, it's a nice employment environment, but also it's so, it's so inspiring to see all these, you know, young people. And it's, and you get this like high from teaching, that I think any good teacher gets, right. You know, at the end of a good class, you're just like, there's like a euphoric feeling. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. I'm really excited to do it again. Like when I'm fifties, sixties, <laugh>, you know, like, I feel like that'll be the time when I'm like, all right, I'm just chill. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>And, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So now you said that originally you went to art school so that you could be, you could play music and, and boy, talk about, a storied history of that being kind of an approach. Right? Yeah. What kind of music, what kind of music were you into <span style="color:red" data-ts="1317.305" data-end_ts="1317.525" title="1317.305" id=c_"1317.305">__it__</span>? What were you doing? And do you still do music? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>I do still do music. It's been, it's been more or less the one constant in my life. I started, I started playing music when I was about five, five or six years old. And I always have, and just like in other things, I've always been restless about it. So I never got, I never got good at any one instrument, but I can, I can fake my way through almost all of them. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, when I was about 14, I stumbled upon, an analog synthesizer. And, and that was, that was the thing that like, kind of changed and defined my musical life. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. I, I got just obsessed with, I've been obsessed with since now for 22 years, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>Nice. And, but I still would like play drums and play guitar and things. And I played in punk bands and I played in like Britt pop cover bands, and I played in, like electronics of pop bands, and I made dance music and I made hip hop music. And I've, I've done, I've done the whole, the whole deal. But the, the one thing that's that's interesting is it's always kind of like ebb and flowed. Like, there's been times in my life where, where I'm playing music more and making music more. And then there's times in my life where it kind of fades into the background and I, you know, sell all my gear and like, I'm not doing this anymore. And then it always creeps back in. And I think the times in my life when I've been the happiest have been when I'm making the most music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>Right. And now I'm, you know, I have like zero aspirations to ever be successful at playing music. And I think I kind of always have, like, I've always just enjoyed the act of doing it. Right now, I'm more self-aware that like, the important thing about making music for me is just that it makes my life better. Sure. And it makes me happy. And as a useful side effect, I can use them as sound effects or, soundtracks for films. Right. <laugh>. But, but I, I think it's, it's just like this like beautiful human thing to do. Yeah. I think, I think it's, it's odd that we don't have a culture of just playing music, being just a thing that everybody does, you know? You don't have to be good at it. You don't have to like, even perform out for people. It's just a, it's just a wonderful thing to do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I hear you. Well, it's interesting too because some of how you frame, like your relationship with playing and with, you know, the accumulation of instruments or whatever, that, that really resonates with me. I do. I kinda get this thing where it's like, you know, I want to get one more thing. I want <span style="color:red" data-ts="1501.445" data-end_ts="1501.525" title="1501.445" id=c_"1501.445">__to__</span> get more one thing, and then I look and I'm like, I got too much shit. It's all gotta go. And, because on one hand it seems like the, the equipment, you know, really enables you to, to have that enjoyment and stuff like that. But at some point then all of a sudden you look at it and you're like, how did it get through <span style="color:red" data-ts="1521.125" data-end_ts="1521.205" title="1521.125" id=c_"1521.125">__you__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1521.205" data-end_ts="1521.405" title="1521.205" id=c_"1521.205">__about__</span> the gear? It's gotta be about something Yeah. Deeper than that. And then there ends up being like, this welling <span style="color:red" data-ts="1526.325" data-end_ts="1526.485" title="1526.325" id=c_"1526.325">__up__</span> of frustration. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah. I mean, I think the, the thing I eventually realized for me was that this desire for new equipment really just stemmed from the, like, you see a new piece of equipment and you imagine like, ooh, these new sounds or these new possibilities. Like I can, I can have those. And so you research the piece of equipment and you like, do all this stuff, and then it comes and you get really excited and you like, sit down and make a whole bunch of music for like three or four days and then you're kind of bored of it. Right. <laugh>, you know, or, or, or then you move on to the next thing. Now whenever I see something new that I think looks really exciting, I go into my studio and I try to just replicate what that thing can do with what I already have Uhhuh <affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>And it has the same end effect. Like, oh, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1576.445" data-end_ts="1576.685" title="1576.445" id=c_"1576.445">__sure__</span>. I, I get really, I get really into the studio. I think it's just in any art, whether it's music or visual art or filmmaking or writing. I had, I had a teacher in college who told me the best thing that I've tried to live my life by, which is whatever gets you into the studio and gets you working is the thing you should be doing. Ah. And I think that the like, desire for new gear, when the new gear comes, it's something that gets you into the studio. Sure. And that feels good to you. Right. So my whole life I've been trying to come up with better, more healthy, more long-term sustainable solution to get me into doing the things that I want to be doing. And also I have a new role of, as of the last three years <span style="color:red" data-ts="1622.225" data-end_ts="1622.445" title="1622.225" id=c_"1622.225">__is__</span> I have one desk and I'm only allowed to have enough stuff that can fit on that one desk. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's an interesting approach, run <span style="color:red" data-ts="1630.165" data-end_ts="1630.205" title="1630.165" id=c_"1630.165">__approach__</span>. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>Yeah. If I run out, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Something's gotta go. Yeah. Well, you know, it's, that's similar to my rule about <span style="color:red" data-ts="1636.155" data-end_ts="1636.445" title="1636.155" id=c_"1636.155">__mock__</span>. So I'm <span style="color:red" data-ts="1636.965" data-end_ts="1637.045" title="1636.965" id=c_"1636.965">__a__</span> Maseth guy and my rule is that I have this, I have this tip <span style="color:red" data-ts="1642.145" data-end_ts="1642.365" title="1642.145" id=c_"1642.145">__top__</span> case that holds, it's called a Station 2 52 'cause it holds 252 HP of modules. And I have decided that that's all the more space I'm gonna dedicate to modules in my life. Yep. So for sure, if there's something I really gotta, gotta gotta have, something else has to go. And what that's meant is that I have winnowed this thing into being a very, very personal and idiosyncratic, but very expressive for me system. It doesn't have sort of like one <span style="color:red" data-ts="1677.315" data-end_ts="1677.605" title="1677.315" id=c_"1677.315">__shot__</span> wonders or things that are bright, shiny objects. It's the stuff that I can consistently do interesting work with. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1687.625" data-end_ts="1687.845" title="1687.625" id=c_"1687.625">__so__</span> Absolutely.

Or, or do you now currently use? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>Well, so now I am, trying to, I mean, I, I used to be a big Euro rack fan. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> at one point, actually, right when I, right when I left Brooklyn, I had a wall of it, you know, . And it, it was very cool. But this was maybe five years ago, Uhhuh, when you could probably, like, you could fill a dinner table with all the people who are making modules at that time. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1722.985" data-end_ts="1723.205" title="1722.985" id=c_"1722.985">__And__</span> now there's just like, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>There's so many, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>I don't even know how many, it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1726.525" data-end_ts="1726.645" title="1726.525" id=c_"1726.525">__unusual__</span> every time I like glance, glance back at the Eurorack forum, I'm like, what are all these <span style="color:red" data-ts="1731.315" data-end_ts="1731.805" title="1731.315" id=c_"1731.315">__modules__</span>? Who are these people making these things crazy? Right. But at the same time, working with modular is so great. And when, when I was in college, we had, a, a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1744.825" data-end_ts="1745.045" title="1744.825" id=c_"1744.825">__mug__</span> modular, and we had a <inaudible>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1746.545" data-end_ts="1746.765" title="1746.545" id=c_"1746.545">__we__</span> had a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1747.005" data-end_ts="1747.165" title="1747.005" id=c_"1747.005">__surge__</span>. And, and I always loved playing with that stuff. And I actually, in, in 1999, I think I actually bought a, a fer, modular. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>Which is way ahead of the year. It was like, when do <span style="color:red" data-ts="1761.965" data-end_ts="1762.165" title="1761.965" id=c_"1761.965">__for__</span> first Right. First came out, I was so excited that there's just something portable and, economically feasible to own. Right. But it became, it became that thing again. Like I realized like with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1776.915" data-end_ts="1777.205" title="1776.915" id=c_"1776.915">__urac__</span>, there was just so much, there was so much time you could spend just researching it and looking into things and listening to demos and thinking about, oh, do I need that? Or do I need that? Or going on the modular grid and rearranging your case 500 times. And I was like, this, this sucks. This is like really overwhelming. So, so now I, I have a, a modest <span style="color:red" data-ts="1799.075" data-end_ts="1799.365" title="1799.075" id=c_"1799.075">__size__</span> surge system. That's my, my main instrument. Okay. And my rule for the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1805.005" data-end_ts="1805.165" title="1805.005" id=c_"1805.005">__surge__</span>, I kind of, I jumpstarted it by buying a couple of panels, but my rule is I have to build all of it. Oh, okay. Anything I'm gonna get at, I have to build. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Like the CGS stuff? Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>Yeah. CGS and there's also a German company called Random Source that's making things now. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>Based on CGS and, well, based on Surge Designs still 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>But in a, they, they use SMT parts, and I think they're a little less authentic, but a little more sophisticated. Sure. But that's been really nice to just limit it down to that being sort of the one instrument. I have a couple other little things. Like I have like a micro <span style="color:red" data-ts="1849.555" data-end_ts="1849.845" title="1849.555" id=c_"1849.555">__root__</span> that I mostly use as a controller and a, and a chord vocal key in case I need to play a chord. Right. For some reason. Right. <laugh>, but <laugh>. But it's actually been really, really cool. And since I've, since I've gotten the search, it's, I've been a lot more productive because, like you hear this time and time again, but as soon as you limit the tools that you can use, your productivity goes way up. Most of you just spend less time fiddling with the tools and more time chasing the thing that you're meant to be chasing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. It's interesting that you settle on search. My, my first serious modular was a search. I had a, like a seven panel search system is pretty huge. I think that in a way, a lot of what I'm seeing myself do with Eurorack is kind of going back to the simplicity, but flexibility that I experienced with the search. You know, I'm, I'm finding ways to get that kind of similar functionality, in, in this smaller format thing because I was, I found myself being very productive and, and being very musical with, with the search system. Again, I think you, you identified this, the limitations, it provides limitations, but it, it, it sort of like says, I'm gonna close off once avenue of options and instead present this maybe less o obvious, but kind of artistically interesting avenue, <laugh> and Mm-Hmm. So if you wanna, if you <span style="color:red" data-ts="1949.405" data-end_ts="1949.565" title="1949.405" id=c_"1949.405">__wanna__</span> explore, you're gonna have to go that way instead. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>Right. Yeah. I mean, and I think for me, the, the, the cool thing about Surge is that like, everything you need is in there. Right. It's just not, like, I have a lot of friends who use Eurorack, and I'll see they get some like, fancy new module showing it off to me, and I'll be like, oh, that's actually pretty cool. And then in my brain, I'm just reconstructing how I can do that on the surge. And you, you can, you know, <laugh>, right? Like, it'll take, you don't just push a button and you have to, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1981.165" data-end_ts="1981.445" title="1981.165" id=c_"1981.165">__pass__</span> some stuff up. But that to me, like, like the search feels like a fundamental set of building blocks. Right. And that was the thing that always sparked my imagination, about, about modular sense, was that you can, you can build this thing up from very small pieces. Yeah. And I think as Eurorack became about denser modules and more like complete function blocks, I lost interest. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, one of the things that I, I danced with, and then I realize how unsatisfying it is, is modules that do too much modules that literally kind of predefine how they're gonna work. That's the thing that initially, you know, like you said, you, you jump in a studio and your first shot, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2031.285" data-end_ts="2031.445" title="2031.285" id=c_"2031.285">__it__</span> is like, oh, it sounds awesome. This is amazing. It's wonderful. But three days later you're like, well, it's still doing that same thing, and I would really like it to do a different thing now, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>Yeah. I got a, I got a new pedal recently, and I was, I was really excited and I played with it, and I was like, yes, this is great. And then I, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2054.185" data-end_ts="2054.405" title="2054.185" id=c_"2054.185">__had__</span> just ran like the, the, an orated sequence on the, on the micro <span style="color:red" data-ts="2059.345" data-end_ts="2059.565" title="2059.345" id=c_"2059.345">__bru__</span> through it, and like was sweeping the filter up. And I was like, oh my God, there's this record and I won't name the artist, but this artist entire one album of this entire artist, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Is that the 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>Whole album? It's just running Arpeggiated <span style="color:red" data-ts="2074.525" data-end_ts="2074.805" title="2074.525" id=c_"2074.525">__Sense__</span> through this one setting on this one Pedal, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b><laugh>. And I was just sitting there like recreating his whole album for a night, just like loving it, being like, he never even turns this knob. Like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2087.515" data-end_ts="2087.805" title="2087.515" id=c_"2087.515">__it's__</span> this, there's something great about that. But at the same time, it made me like kind of, I kind of hate that <span style="color:red" data-ts="2093.925" data-end_ts="2094.245" title="2093.925" id=c_"2093.925">__<inaudible>__</span> because I feel like I can't use it because Yeah. It's, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's already been 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>Other album, but I'll, I'll Yeah. I'll, I'll find a new way to use 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It. Yeah. Somebody else put the queen's flag on it already, right? Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>Exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I wanna talk a little bit about, undervolt, because this is the thing, you know, this is where, your name first came up, in my discussions with Andrew and I actually went and did some diving around, and it's a fascinating, it's a fascinating undertaking. So what you've got, what you're doing is basically taking a lot of the concepts of like a record label, but applying them to video art, which is pretty interesting and it's a pretty interesting approach. Now, my first question is, what did you find that was, that made the similarity work, and where did you find places where, they didn't really correlate? I mean, where, where was the record company concept viable, and where did it not really work? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>It's an interesting question because I, I think actually the correlation's been pretty dead on. In terms of like, the things that we've been successful at are the things that I think current record labels are successful at, and the things that we've failed at or not failed, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2185.905" data-end_ts="2186.125" title="2185.905" id=c_"2185.905">__the__</span> things that we've struggled with have been things that current record labels are struggling with. Sure. So in in concrete terms, you know, album sales are not making this thing, the, the, the album sales aren't great, you know? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And we were expecting that going in. Right. And I think every record label would tell you the same thing. Right. Now that's not, that's not where they're giving value to their artists. But what has been really successful for us is doing events, doing performances, and also just like bundling this great group of people together into one bigger force. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>Right. Which gives us a lot of opportunities that those artists wouldn't necessarily have on their own. It also lets us kind of, you know, we have a mix of like, fairly well established people in this field and, newcomers or people whose work has just been undervalued or under-recognized up until now. Right. And it's nice that we can kind of ooey up these people who are doing great work who might not have had those kinds of opportunities on their own. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, yeah. But it's, it's, it's been interesting to see how closely it does mirror what's, what's going on in the music industry. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Yeah. It does seem like, at this point, in the music world, the, the concept of the record label as being sort of an accumulator of talent that that works well together is it's, is kind of the strongest position that it has. And so I think you're right. And also the concept that album sales aren't, what's really the exciting side of labels at this point is also pretty interesting. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So what the, the question I then have though is with, there is an extent to which the output of record labels can sort of live on its own, just in that you release records and, you know, DJs can play them or people can enjoy them in their home or whatever. It seems like video art tends to be a little bit more location oriented. Like, you know, either having a gallery space that knows how to deal with video art or it, or, you know, putting together something that has kind of a specific locale. Am am I missing the point, or is that No, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>That's, that's actually a very good point. Because we started as an alternative to the current option that there for video artists. And it, it was, the label was started by, Yoshi Soka who has had an incredible career. And, and then I jumped on board and, a number of other artists. So it was built by artists, and it was built by a group of artists who were very frustrated by this thing that didn't exist. And we were trying to make the thing that didn't exist. And that is that if you are not a proper gallery artist and you're working in video art, there's nowhere for your work to go that it makes sense. Right. Right. Like, obviously TV and film doesn't want it. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, galleries have a hard time selling it, so they don't want it. Right. Academia is just weird, <laugh> and, and, and not necessarily welcoming, to the, the kind of work that our artists do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2406.755" data-end_ts="2407.045" title="2406.755" id=c_"2406.755">__Yeah__</span>. So, and this is like an age old problem. I mean, this goes back to like people working in this way since the thirties. There's always been, like you look at people like Stan Backage. Stan Brack never had an actual career. I mean, you look back and you made this incredible body of work and everybody knows of his legacy Yeah. And all of this stuff, but he died pretty much broke. You know, he, he, he's got some accolades and some things, but the gallery world didn't want him. The TV and film world didn't want him. Nobody wanted him. So part of the, the main impetus for creating this thing was to say like, here's a place where this kind of work makes sense. Sure. Now, where I think we've struggled is exactly what, what you're talking about <span style="color:red" data-ts="2455.505" data-end_ts="2455.725" title="2455.505" id=c_"2455.505">__in__</span> that we have not yet been able to crack, and this is like a technology problem. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>Like we we're, again, we're just very small artist run. But I think the, the key to making this something that would be essential to people's lives is figuring out the technology part of how you deliver it to them in a way that's, that fits in their lives. Right. I was really obsessed for a while with the idea of a live streaming option or a Roku channel, or, you know, something along those lines. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Because I thought that could start to open it up. But we, this was just me trying to code this thing, but I have no idea how to actually code <laugh>, so it didn't work so good. But I think there really is a space there. And actually yesterday or two days ago, I was doing a, a similar phone interview, with a really excitable young man, who, who I hope succeeds. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>But what he's trying to do is build such a platform, like something that's creator friendly for artists who are making more avant garde, more weird, more out there stuff, but find a way to deliver it to people who wanna watch it in a way where it monetizes it for artists and also makes it, you know, an enjoyable and digestible experience Right. For people who want. Right. And it's a, it's a tough, it's a tough problem. It's an inherently niche market, but, but you know, we have these funny ideas of scale these days. You know, if there's a hundred thousand people in the United States who would be very interested in something, nobody caress, <laugh>. Yeah. You know, I know when, when you're talking about, you know, and I, I work at Buzzfeed, I, I, I see this every day when you, when you're talking about something that's not in the scales of millions, nobody caress. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>Right. And I don't think that's a new problem in the mainstream, but I feel like it is a new problem in more underground scenes and more avant-garde scenes. There. And I feel like in the nineties and whatnot, there was this really strong culture of, DIY releasing and DIY distribution. Yeah. And I just think before the internet, there was an inherent financial part of it. You can, you wouldn't ship something to somebody for free. Right. Somebody wanted to hear a cool record, they had to pay for it, <laugh>, you know, they just had to. Right. And now that that burden's been gone, I, I feel like the people who are really feeling it the most are these people with like, maybe just a hundred thousand fans, but that's still a lot of people. You know, it's a lot of people you should, you should be able to, should be able to do something like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>But the way that we've kind of built the infrastructure for, the internet, that's not seen as significant. You know? YouTube won't make you a partner if you're regularly getting a hundred thousand views, but it's like, I'm getting a hundred thousand views that's more than a lot of cable shows. It, it's super interesting for me now to see the big, the big version of that. Because when, when if we do something at buzz <span style="color:red" data-ts="2659.005" data-end_ts="2659.245" title="2659.005" id=c_"2659.005">__season__</span>, it gets 500,000 views, it's like, nah, yeah, maybe we shouldn't do that anymore. Like, that's, that's considered a failure. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, you mentioned that it was fascinating being part of Buzzfeed and I, I would imagine you are sort of like, you know, getting to watch the fire hose, you know? Yeah. Yeah. It, it's gotta be crazy. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>It's also, it's, it's wild to see, I mean, you know, we're doing fine as a company, but like, shouldn't we be making a lot more money? <laugh>, you know, <laugh> like, when, when you're looking at a scale of where 500,000 viewers is a failure, right. On a daily basis, and you're getting billions and billions of content views that's unprecedented. Like the, the size of viewership that we have Yeah. Is unprecedented in human history for a media company. Yeah. And by any logic, we should be the most valuable media company in the world. Right. We're not <laugh>, but why not? I mean, it's, it just feels like something about, and there's a really good book about this that I cite a lot called, who Owns the Future, and it's by, Jaron Lanier. Yeah. Who was, you know, he <span style="color:red" data-ts="2735.125" data-end_ts="2735.205" title="2735.125" id=c_"2735.125">__was__</span>, he was the guy who coined the term cyberspace, but he, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>He, he's sort of a skeptic of the whole thing though. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>He, he is, and now he is extremely skeptical, right. Because he identifies this, this problem where the internet just kind of sucked all of the money out of what would've been previously known as the middle class, you know? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, all these middle class jobs are replaced, you know, these huge, what used to be huge companies can now have 30 employees Right. And operate in the same space. Yeah. They don't need 3000 employees anymore. They can do it. And the internet started with this very utopian ideal of like, oh, everything's free and everything's shared and everybody's, and it's like, that's great, but it would be great if nobody was making money anymore. Right. But all it's really done is just made it very easy to consolidate where that wealth goes. Right. Where all the money that's going into the internet is, it's so easy to funnel it into tiny little things. And I, and I feel like who's really getting squeezed are people who are trying to do more niche endeavors. You, you don't get the same if you're getting a, if you, if you're getting a hundred thousand viewers, you should be getting 10% of what somebody who gets a million viewers is getting, right. But that's not how the internet has been structured 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2816.665" data-end_ts="2816.885" title="2816.665" id=c_"2816.665">__To__</span> work. That's not how it goes, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>Right. So it's, it's kind of like you're big or you're nothing. Right. And, he puts out this, his, his theory or his solution to this, which, I I'm obsessed with and just nobody's done it. Right. And maybe it's too late, but, but his whole idea is, micropayment for content views. So like, every time you watch a video on YouTube, you pay like 0.10 cents. Right. For the average people watching YouTube, if you, if you watch like 10 hours of YouTube a day for a month that equals up to like 16 or $17 a month, Uhhuh <affirmative>, which I think people would happily pay. Right. And you would lose the entire, you wouldn't need the entire advertising system. You would just get rid of all of that and you could pay content creators flatly across the board just per views, and it would equal out to the same that the big companies are making for ad revenues. But it would, it would create more possibility for people who are doing much smaller operations. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I think that that's, I think one of the things too that has to happen is there has to be some mechanism by which you can be, you can be viable in the, in the content production world without having to ha somehow be attached to the Kardashian family, right. Or something. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2905.395" data-end_ts="2905.685" title="2905.395" id=c_"2905.395">__Yeah__</span>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2906.145" data-end_ts="2906.365" title="2906.145" id=c_"2906.145">__Yes__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>There has to be a way Absolutely. To basically, basically say, you know, there, there can be the production of, of valuable content that doesn't have to be glitz and glamor, that doesn't have to be celebrity driven, but can be quality driven. And I think that's the one thing where the internet has kind of let us down. It, it has, it has foregrounded the people magazine culture and, and the Wired magazine culture, but nobody, nobody has stepped up and, and had a play for like the zine culture. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative>, and this kind of goes back to your, your ideas of like some of the earlier DIYI mean, I think back I was like really involved in sort of like, you know, the punk culture where, you know, somebody would have this magazine that they would make 50 of and they'd go to Kinko's and run 'em off on a Xerox machine and Yeah. You know, you'd, you'd pay your $12 a year just because you could keep in touch with the Oregon punk scene or whatever. Right? <span style="color:red" data-ts="2977.945" data-end_ts="2978.165" title="2977.945" id=c_"2977.945">__Yep__</span>. It <span style="color:red" data-ts="2978.925" data-end_ts="2979.005" title="2978.925" id=c_"2978.925">__is__</span> fabulous. But there's, now you're right. That that would be the assumption is that's free. Why would I ever have to pay for such a thing? <span style="color:red" data-ts="2986.595" data-end_ts="2986.885" title="2986.595" id=c_"2986.595">__Yeah__</span>. And there are people that are making money off of the fact that this stuff exists on the internet. It's just not any of the people that are in, that are driving that part of the culture. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>Yeah. And it's, it's, it's this, it's this great trick that was played <span style="color:red" data-ts="3001.835" data-end_ts="3001.995" title="3001.835" id=c_"3001.835">__in__</span>, I don't think it was maliciously <span style="color:red" data-ts="3003.615" data-end_ts="3004.035" title="3003.615" id=c_"3003.615">__played__</span>. Like, I don't think this was anybody's big plan. It's just kind of the way it evolved. And you don't realize that, you know, every time you upload something to Instagram, you're making Instagram as a company more valuable. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> And what are they giving you? They're giving you an app that you know really that it's not adding that much value to your life, <laugh>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3027.925" data-end_ts="3028.125" title="3027.925" id=c_"3027.925">__Right__</span>. You know, not, not enough that you're, you know, it's, it's, it's just weird. We all feed this huge machine, and there, there is actual revenue being generated from it, but it's going to kind of all the wrong places. It seems 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Like it. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>And it, it also feels almost like it's too late to correct. Like it grew into what it was, and now you just gotta hope somebody takes it down <laugh>, you know? Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. And I don't even know what that could look like at this point. It's, it's hard to imagine. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>Well, it's interesting to see the kind of band-aids that have grown over it. And for me right now, like the band-aids are a Kickstarter and GoFundMe and things like that, where you've pretty much reduced creative people to begging for money Right. On the internet, <laugh>. Which is not a, like, I don't know if you've ever talked to Andrew about, Kickstarter or, I haven't very, he's, he's very against those as well. Uhhuh <affirmative>. And a lot of artists I know are very against it because they are just like, you know, I just don't want to go out and publicly beg for money to make this thing that I <span style="color:red" data-ts="3098.645" data-end_ts="3098.805" title="3098.645" id=c_"3098.645">__wanna__</span> make. That's <span style="color:red" data-ts="3099.545" data-end_ts="3099.765" title="3099.545" id=c_"3099.545">__so__</span> weird and uncomfortable position to be in. But that's kind of the bandaid that's grown up around this system. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>And, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, there's also a, a primary flaw to me with that system, which is that the people that you're for, from whom you're asking the money, they are basically put in a position to judge your work before it's done, which is sort of like the antithesis of what making art is about. You make the art. Yeah. And then you put it out there, you put it out there, you know, you take the big gulp of air, you throw the artwork out there and see what the reaction is, and hopefully it's positive, but even if it's negative, something valuable comes out of the process. When, when the whole thing is foregrounded by funding the negative half of that just means, well, I'm just not gonna do that work then. And the positive end of it did end up looking like, well, okay, I gotta pay off for my begging <laugh>. It somehow doesn't seem artistic at all. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>Yeah. And it's just, you know, the, the, the thing that drives me nuts is that, people are consuming more media than ever, and they love it. You know, there's more obsession about <span style="color:red" data-ts="3182.635" data-end_ts="3182.855" title="3182.635" id=c_"3182.635">__all__</span> so many different kinds of media than there ever has been before, and you'd think that would make it more valuable, but it's, it's had the opposite effect of kind of just devaluing it across the board. And, you know, I know, I mean, I know a lot of people have been very successful, as artists and as creators, but I know many more who were great and were doing really interesting things and had strong followings who would eventually just stop because you have to cross a certain threshold before you'll, you'll be able to make a living in any significant way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. And so it feels like even though you have a lot of supporters, it feels like it's withering because it doesn't match the numbers that we've now come to expect. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3239.005" data-end_ts="3239.295" title="3239.005" id=c_"3239.005">__Yeah__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, you know, I really hope that we wouldn't, 'cause one of the things I noticed with, with other interviews that you've done is a lot of people are like, oh, wonderful. How do y make money on there? <laugh>, right? Yeah. But, it's, it is, it's interesting. I mean, we kind of went a different tangent. I mean, we're almost like we're about, I think between you and I, we're about ready to start, like occupy Silicon Valley <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>Yeah, yeah. <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Because, it is frustrating. It's a frustrating thing to see, and it's, it actually is kind of an important thing to talk about in the art world too. So I appreciate you being willing to talk about it, even though I was gonna try not to make you go down that path. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>Yeah. Well, I mean, when, when you had mentioned that, I mean, the, whenever I talk to people, it, it, the idea of making money never comes up pretty much until we start talking about Undervolt. And then it's just such an inherent part of the conversation because we are, you know, it is, it is a business. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, and you identify as a label, and so there's, there is a commercial aspect to saying that, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>Yeah. And I also do think, I think it's a, you know, I think one of the interesting things about doing Undervolt, and it is an interesting opportunity to talk about the way the economy of the internet works, right? And it's something that people just don't talk about, in, in any substantive way in any, I, I kind of feel like any chance I get to approach that conversation, I, I'll, I lean into it, <laugh>. So it's, it's definitely my fault, <laugh>. But, but I think it's important, and I think we're, we're gonna lose <span style="color:red" data-ts="3340.115" data-end_ts="3340.335" title="3340.115" id=c_"3340.115">__you__</span>. You, you made a really good point. We're gonna just, like, Kardashian culture is what happens when you, you don't find a way to economically support for like <span style="color:red" data-ts="3352.315" data-end_ts="3352.735" title="3352.315" id=c_"3352.315">__middle__</span> letter of people doing interesting things that will never have a mass appeal. Right. And we've kind of lost as a culture, we've lost our mechanisms to support those people. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It seems like it, you're right. Well, on that not altogether uplifting note, our time is, our time is pretty much up. But, one thing I'd like to do is for, is for you to just give a shout out about, where to find the undervolt work, where to find your work so that people, who are listening to podcasts can, can jump out there and check, check the things that you've been doing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>Cool. Well, my personal website is just Johnny Woodscom. I also do, I still sell DVDs because I'm old school. And actually I don't put a lot of my work on my website. So you have to get the DVDs, <laugh>, but and then Undervolt is@undervolt.co. That's the website. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright, cool. I wanna thank you so much for the time that, that you've dedicated to this and for being willing to kind of just like shoot all over the place and talk about crazy stuff. It was great. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="3423.645" data-end_ts="3424.045" title="3423.645" id=c_"3423.645">__That's__</span>, thank you so much, Darvin. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3425.125" data-end_ts="3425.285" title="3425.125" id=c_"3425.125">__It__</span> was great. Alright. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And next time I'm in LA we're gonna have to go out and catch some beers and tacos or something because yeah, I want to carry on this conversation, but I want to do it face to face too, so. Cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>Sounds good. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="3437.565" data-end_ts="3438.005" title="3437.565" id=c_"3437.565">__Alright__</span> man. Thanks a lot. We'll catch you soon. Bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Johnny: </b>Okay, bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Many thanks to Johnny Woods again for spending the time with us and kind of taking this wide ranging discussion through all the different things he's interested in and all the things he's concerned about. I want to thank you for listening, for continuing to listen as we are getting into a huge, huge stack of podcasts. If you haven't done so in a while, you might want to take a look at our back catalog. We've got a lot of interesting people you can listen to. And, if you have any suggestions, please drop me a line at ddg@cyclingseventyfour.com. We'll see what we can do about it. Thanks a lot and I'll catch you soon. Bye.
