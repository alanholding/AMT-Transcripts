<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today I have an opportunity to speak to someone who, in a real, very real way, <span style="color:red" data-ts="18.125" data-end_ts="18.345" title="18.125" id=c_"18.125">__is__</span> kind of father to us all. His name is Herbie Hancock If you don't know him, you don't live on this planet <laugh>. He is, an amazing musician. He's been involved in so many things and continues to be involved in an amazing number of things, and we're gonna try and dive into a bunch of 'em now. One of the things I'll say at the beginning is oftentimes in the podcast we talk about people's backgrounds, but this is a case where we have an opportunity to point you to something particular. There's an autobiography that was written called, possibilities, that's about Herbie's life. And realistically, it's the place to go for a lot of, his background and his beginning stories. It's a, it's a tremendous dive into that background. But, so that being said, let's say hello to Herbie. Hey, Herbie, how's it going? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herbie Hancock: </b>Great, Darwin, how you doing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm all right. Thanks so much for taking time outta your schedule to have this chat. Why don't we kick this off by, having you talk a little bit about some of the stuff that you're working on right now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herbie: </b>Okay. I'm working on a new record, <laugh>, actually, the working on a new record has become old <laugh> <laugh>. I've been working on it for two years so far, <span style="color:red" data-ts="89.905" data-end_ts="90.125" title="89.905" id=c_"89.905">__and__</span>, and counting. But, I mean, I've, I targeted like June as you know, next month. Sure. Hopefully I can release some of it. You know, maybe two, three, maybe four things. I see. Okay. Maybe three things. <laugh>. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Is this something that you're looking to release digitally? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herbie: </b>How can you not release something digitally today? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Good point, <laugh>. Good point. I guess you could send out cassette tapes or something, I guess, right. <laugh>, I guess I was thinking more in terms of like streaming specifically, rather than having like CDs created or something like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herbie: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="128.905" data-end_ts="129.125" title="128.905" id=c_"128.905">__Oh__</span>, well, label might insist on there being some CDs. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Some sort of physical Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herbie: </b>But, but the main thing is, is, it'll be iTunes and other forms, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="138.845" data-end_ts="139.125" title="138.845" id=c_"138.845">__Some__</span> services. Right? Yeah. Yeah. So a lot of the work that you've been doing over the last decade really has been a lot of work, collaborative work and duet work. I mean, whether it's your, the work that you did with Flying Lotus or, some of the things you did, like the Imagine Project and even the possibilities, record. You did a lot of, duets. What is it that kind of drove you to do to working with individuals in that way? What, what did you find compelling about that 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herbie: </b>Variety? Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herbie: </b>And the fact that, I got a chance to work with stellar creators, you know, and artists, and to have the great opportunity to work with them and create something in tandem with them. It's very stimulating to my own creativity to try to figure out how to make something work With Paul Simon, for example, his background is different than mine, you know, his musical background is, <span style="color:red" data-ts="198.185" data-end_ts="198.405" title="198.185" id=c_"198.185">__is__</span> is different. His experiences are different. And, and to try to an idea that he may have, that he might not be able to on his own, execute musically and needs somebody to kind of realize it. For him, I had to really dig deep to be able to do, he presented a puzzle to me, <laugh>. Right, right. I mean, he didn't know it was a puzzle, <laugh>, but I, I knew it was a puzzle. <laugh>, it was, he said, how can we do this song with just one chord? And it was a song that he had written years ago that had a lot of chords in it. Right. Like <span style="color:red" data-ts="235.445" data-end_ts="235.645" title="235.445" id=c_"235.445">__<inaudible>__</span>. Right. And I, my challenge was exactly that. How can I meet that? You know, I knew that I couldn't just use one chord, but how can I make some kind of compromise that we <span style="color:red" data-ts="250.205" data-end_ts="250.405" title="250.205" id=c_"250.205">__most__</span> might <span style="color:red" data-ts="250.765" data-end_ts="251.045" title="250.765" id=c_"250.765">__agree__</span> to? And, and I figured it out. It was actually having a base note that didn't move. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herbie: </b>And then its chords moved around it, but I, I tried to change the chord structure in a way that sounded like it was rooted in that one base note, you <span style="color:red" data-ts="269.005" data-end_ts="269.085" title="269.005" id=c_"269.005">__know__</span>? And then there was a release that went to a couple other courts, but then, and he was totally happy with it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, no doubt. Well, that sounds, that sounds amazing. Now, it strikes me that with your long playing career, that sometimes having those experiences of almost having to do improbable stuff probably is, is one of the great excitements that, that you get to interact with, huh? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herbie: </b>Yeah, because I, I remember when he, when Paul said that, my inner voice said, no, that can't be done. <laugh> <laugh>. And then before I blurted anything out, I said, wait a minute. And I remembered something that Miles Davis taught me without purposely teaching me something. And I wrote about it in my book, and it was when I played a wrong chord at, the peak of the evening of one of the best concerts on our tour when Miles' <span style="color:red" data-ts="322.245" data-end_ts="322.445" title="322.245" id=c_"322.245">__Solo__</span> was peeking. And we had the audience in the palm of our hands that I played this really wrong <span style="color:red" data-ts="327.835" data-end_ts="328.125" title="327.835" id=c_"327.835">__cord__</span>, and it was so loud and so strong. There was a space, and I just hit that cord. All of a sudden, I felt like I was getting smaller and smaller, <laugh> <laugh>, and I was purposely getting smaller to, to <span style="color:red" data-ts="342.395" data-end_ts="342.685" title="342.395" id=c_"342.395">__shut__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="342.685" data-end_ts="342.845" title="342.685" id=c_"342.685">__it__</span> sink into the carpet. Right, right. But Miles took a breath, and he played some notes, and he made my chord. Right. He made it fit. And it took me years to figure out what he did. He did what jazz musicians traditionally do, which is not to judge what somebody else plays. He didn't judge what I played, but I did. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herbie: </b>So it was, my problem was judging it as wrong. Miles's issue was, how can I make this, whatever this new thing was that just came up, how can I make that fit into the grand scheme of things? Right. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="383.325" data-end_ts="383.445" title="383.325" id=c_"383.325">__he__</span> did. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, miles, miles was really influential in a lot of different parts of your kind of coming up through the, through the music, world. And one of the ways, so if I recall correctly from the book, he was kind of, he was kind of there and very supportive of your first moves into technology, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herbie: </b>Yeah. The, the first time I played an electric instrument, which was the Defender Rhodes Piano, it was, because Miles had called a recording session. We get down to the studio and everybody's kind of warming up, and I'm looking around for the piano, and I didn't see one <laugh>. And, and so I said to Miles, I said, what do you want me to play? And he pointed to the corner of the room, he said, play that. And I saw there was a Fender Rhodes piano. I'd actually seen maybe a photograph of one Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="441.825" data-end_ts="442.045" title="441.825" id=c_"441.825">__And__</span> I'd never seen one and had, you know, personally, <span style="color:red" data-ts="444.405" data-end_ts="444.525" title="444.405" id=c_"444.405">__I__</span> never played one. But I started thinking about, and my first thoughts were, huh, you want me to play that? You know, piano players, we don't like that instrument. We, you know, that's not a real instrument and all kinds of negative things I'm thinking. But Miles asked me to play it. So I brought it over, turned it on, and I played a chord on it, and it sounded pretty. And I went, this has a nice sound. I mean, I was shocked, but something occurred to me that was very important, and that was that I used someone else's judgment and made it my own before I even had my own experience. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herbie: </b>With the thing that's a life lesson I learned. Yeah. But I didn't realize that until later when I started practicing Buddhism. That's when I realized that was a life lesson. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. I, I'm gonna wanna come back to the, the discussion of Buddhism, because I, I think that that is certainly in your book, that's such an important thread that pulls together about your life. But I want to, I want to ask a few more things before we get there. Okay. So that was your introduction to an electric instrument. What was the point at which you started thinking of your primary instrument as being either an electric instrument or an electronic instrument? What was the instrument, or what was the thing that compelled you to st Now this is my thing, rather than an acoustic keyboard 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herbie: </b>That hasn't happened yet. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, really? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herbie: </b>Right. <laugh>? No. My primary instrument is the piano when it comes, comes to musical instrument, but actually my primary instrument is me and my life. Yeah. That's what plays the instrument. True. That's, that's, that's what makes the, the music. So the external physical instrument that I play is secondary. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah. But of those, the piano is the main one. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. Yeah. That's, that's a, that's a great point. But of course, my podcast is about music and text, so we have to talk about some of that stuff too, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herbie: </b>Which is fine. Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="567.185" data-end_ts="567.405" title="567.185" id=c_"567.185">__The__</span> the thing is, in a way, your question, you asked me to make that kind of judgment call, but I don't, I don't really think that way. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I for you, I almost asked it backwards. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herbie: </b>Yeah. <laugh>. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sorry about that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herbie: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now one of the things though that is, is really true, people kind of view you as always being willing to put yourself out there with technology, you know, kind of embrace things early, perform with it, and kind of use it to create your own voice. And, you know, there, there are a couple of, couple of spots where everyone can point to almost a sea change in the acceptance of technology in music. And you're at a center of an awful lot of 'em. You know, whether it's the headhunters bringing this aggressive electronic sound, to jazz or rocket, which sort of like brought a lot of hip hop styles, like right up to the every man's radar. Right. You've always kind of put yourself in that position in your, in your book. You, you talk a little bit about having always had this interest and almost innate understanding of gear and of technology, that that was something that seemed really natural to you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herbie: </b>Yeah. Well, let me, let me just say that I was interested in technology before I was interested in music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Really? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herbie: </b>Yes. Well, 'cause I remember when I was a kid, I wondered how does a and I wrote about this too. How <span style="color:red" data-ts="666.405" data-end_ts="666.565" title="666.405" id=c_"666.405">__does__</span>, how does a clock work? Right? I remember taking one apart and then seeing how some of it worked and then putting it back together. It was, you know, it wasn't electronic, but still, it's that same mindset, you know? And I've always been curious about things, but the second component is that I've always been curious about putting something together that everybody says won't go together, <laugh>. Right. If you wanna get me started on a project, just tell me, putting this together with this will not work. And then I immediately have to do it. <laugh> <laugh>, you know, musically I've been, I've been able to do that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Yeah. Really, really very much so. I mean, even to the point, again, another thing that's kind of like, throughout your whole career, I'll never forget when I saw the news of the, of the new Herbie Hancock release called the Joni Letters. Right. And I was like, what? Yeah. It, I mean, it was something where if I had to shake two Dice and one came up, Herbie Hancock and the other one came up, Joni Mitchell, I'd be like, oh, that didn't work out. Right. <laugh> <laugh>, and I'd shake 'em again. Right. I would never imagine that that would've played out. But it turned out to be an incredible album. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herbie: </b>Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. I'll tell you, Jonie listened to jazz artists when she was young, like nine and, and 10 years old. And that is like the first kind of music for her. So she comes from that jazz ethic, and, and people don't know, I didn't even know that for a long time. But Jonie in her bands, some, the, the latter part of her career. Who did she hire? She had Jacko Pastorius on bass. She had Michael Brecker on saxophone, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="779.895" data-end_ts="780.245" title="779.895" id=c_"779.895">__Vinny__</span> and Guitar and 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herbie: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="781.235" data-end_ts="781.525" title="781.235" id=c_"781.235">__Finn__</span>. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Don Elias on, on drums, and That's right. And then, I mean, she, look how many times Wayne Shorter has been on her records. Right. She loves Wayne. Oh, by the way, if you wanna hear a great conversation, you should hear a conversation between Joni Mitchell and Wayne Shorter. Those are like diamonds, <laugh>, because they think alike. They talk alike. They understand each other perfectly. They're like diamonds, if you can keep up with it, <laugh>. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herbie: </b>It's pretty, amazing. I mean, both <span style="color:red" data-ts="815.965" data-end_ts="816.165" title="815.965" id=c_"815.965">__of__</span> of them are, are, are, are used to using imagery in their language. Right. You know, to describe so many things and parables and <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. It's interesting you bring up Wayne Shorter because you, while on one hand you do a lot of stuff where you're always kind of pushing yourself into new things or new collaborations. You still have this really long interaction with Wayne. What is it about him where you and he share the same thought patterns or whatever? What is it that keeps that connection through all this time? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herbie: </b>I think there's a comic relationship between Wayne and I Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herbie: </b>Somehow that's, and maybe past lives. Right. You know, and, and I met him, I think it was either, I think it was like early 1963 when I <span style="color:red" data-ts="870.845" data-end_ts="871.005" title="870.845" id=c_"870.845">__made__</span> him met him. It could <span style="color:red" data-ts="872.045" data-end_ts="872.125" title="872.045" id=c_"872.045">__have__</span> been 62, somewhere between 62 and 63. We were on a Donald Bird record, Donald Burke, great trumpet player. And then in 1963, I joined Miles Davis's Band 64. Wayne became a new member of Miles's Band. And then we were in the band through the rest of my tenure, which was through <span style="color:red" data-ts="896.345" data-end_ts="896.565" title="896.345" id=c_"896.345">__to__</span> 1968. And Wayne continued on with Miles. But Wayne and I have been like brothers, you know, in a, in a way <span style="color:red" data-ts="906.305" data-end_ts="906.525" title="906.305" id=c_"906.305">__for__</span> more than 50 years. You know, he's my best friend. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Oh, that's cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herbie: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You guys still tour and perform a lot together, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herbie: </b>It's on and off. 'cause I mean, he has his own band. Right. But we made this one record called One Plus One Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, and it's just a duet record. You know, periodically there've been, occasions when we've been able to either tour together or just have a one-off or a couple of gigs where we just play as a, a duet. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, talking about Wayne, you know, and, and knowing some of his, beliefs too, it maybe does give us an opportunity to talk, to return to this discussion of Buddhism. One of the things that, one, one of the things that came away as a really strong, strong echo at the end of reading that book was the way that Buddhism has affected your life, and the lives of people around you. But it's, it's funny because one of the things that happens, and as music becomes maybe extracted somewhat from the soul and more considered a technological adv, adventure or whatever, it seems like a lot of times, we we're separating ourselves from maybe the soulful or spiritual aspects of music making and of our lives in general. And I wanted to talk to you specifically about how did, how does Buddhism of, you know, first of all, how did you get drawn into it? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And then how does it affect your language with yourself about creativity? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herbie: </b>The, the way you began phrasing <span style="color:red" data-ts="1013.965" data-end_ts="1014.085" title="1013.965" id=c_"1013.965">__a__</span> question. You talked about different aspects of what, musician might be, you know, the technical musician, <laugh>, you know, voltage control filters and All 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. The gearhead, right? Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herbie: </b>Gearhead. Right. And, but then the other part is playing a ballot, for example. And you're breaching inside to bring something out musically. And then another part is interacting. As jazz musicians, we improvise. And so we interact creatively and compositionally with other musicians. And so, and when you're playing in <span style="color:red" data-ts="1058.415" data-end_ts="1058.535" title="1058.415" id=c_"1058.415">__a__</span>, in a jazz group and say, that emphasis is on the saxophone player and he's improvising, you know, everybody else is trying to do their best to make everything that happens somehow create a whole W-H-O-L-E <laugh>. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Right, right. And <laugh>. So that is kind of triggering an empathetic response. You know, 'cause people empathizing each other. So that is a human quality, you know? So it's almost a humanitarian quality to be able to interact with someone, even someone you don't know. Right. If you're <span style="color:red" data-ts="1103.045" data-end_ts="1103.165" title="1103.045" id=c_"1103.045">__the__</span> jam session, you don't know all the musicians that are there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herbie: </b>You know, they, they, we've all heard the phrase, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1109.305" data-end_ts="1109.525" title="1109.305" id=c_"1109.305">__the__</span> saxophone cutting contest, or, you know, this person versus that person. Right. Chick <span style="color:red" data-ts="1116.325" data-end_ts="1116.565" title="1116.325" id=c_"1116.325">__Korea__</span> versus Herbie Hancock <laugh> chick. And I never, we've never played like that. You can't, that doesn't work. We may challenge each other, but it's, it's in fun. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. It's not to really embarrass anybody else, or, because that leads to the worst kind of result, right. That you could get. Because nobody's gonna enjoy hearing that. And everybody will feel the worst for it. And as a matter of fact, there have been musicians, I've experienced this, that have walked on stage, and their idea is to like, play better than somebody else, but to kind of make the other person sound like nothing. Right? Yeah. Usually those guys don't last. I don't care how good they are. You know, how, how great they are as musicians, they don't last very long. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herbie: </b>'cause nobody wants to hire people like that. So anyway, what what Buddhism does is it takes, you know, through practicing Buddhism, it helps you to see things more clearly. One of the things is to see more clearly how the different aspects of your life are centered really around one main aspect of your life. And that is the connective tissue, is that you're a human being. So what Buddhism does is help you to integrate all the different aspects of your life. So that instead of it being separate compartments, it's one whole. So I'm not different as a human being, as I am, as a musician, as I am interacting with another person. I don't feel, so that helps you to respect yourself. But Buddhism is also about respecting everybody else. Right. And one of the main tenets of Buddhism we practice, which is <span style="color:red" data-ts="1236.845" data-end_ts="1237.245" title="1236.845" id=c_"1236.845">__nature__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1237.265" data-end_ts="1237.485" title="1237.265" id=c_"1237.265">__and__</span> Buddhism, by the way, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1238.565" data-end_ts="1238.765" title="1238.565" id=c_"1238.565">__that__</span> the organization is called Soka <span style="color:red" data-ts="1240.905" data-end_ts="1241.125" title="1240.905" id=c_"1240.905">__Gki__</span> International, or SGI. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herbie: </b>Okay. And so in this practice, what, what we believe is that, you know, this idea of being enlightened or the Buddha nature. Buddha nature is <span style="color:red" data-ts="1253.785" data-end_ts="1254.005" title="1253.785" id=c_"1253.785">__the__</span>, actually the deepest part of life. You know, anything that's living actually has a Buddha nature. But in, in human beings, it's dormant in a way until you awakening it and awakening it is why I do this practice of Buddhism. And it's clarifying. You see a lot of things more clearly, more broadly. I'm saying everybody, everybody's the Buddha. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, basically. That's it. So if we're all equal in that way, that means if you deserve respect, it means that everybody deserves respect. Because everybody is the Buddha, whether you realize it or not, you know? And so the main thing is to not only help yourself elevate your own life, but to help other people elevate their own lives too. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's really interesting because that kind of conceptually stitches together so many of the different things that I think of as your life, whether it's leading or being parts of amazing groups, doing these recording sessions with duets or new artists, but also doing things like humanitarian stuff with the United Nations, doing educational things out there in LA and even on online and stuff like that. I, it, it starts making it seem like all these things are very interconnected for you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herbie: </b>They are. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So let's talk a little bit about how you, how you take music and, and your interest in technology and stuff like that. And how does that then come into play and, and, and influence your humanitarian work and, and your work outside of the music sphere? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herbie: </b>When I first, came on the music scene, right? And, I wanted to write music for a record that I was gonna do, you know, <laugh> like <span style="color:red" data-ts="1369.685" data-end_ts="1369.805" title="1369.685" id=c_"1369.685">__a__</span> position I'm in now trying to <span style="color:red" data-ts="1371.045" data-end_ts="1371.205" title="1371.045" id=c_"1371.045">__Right__</span>. Put a together at the time, I would think, okay, let's write a tune, right? And start out with a baseline, for example, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I would just be thinking about what I would do musically, and that's everything would spring from that. Now, first question I ask myself is, why do I wanna make a record? What's the purpose? That's a whole different ball game, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herbie: </b>Soon as you think about purpose, it gives a, gives you a platform that has to do with life. And it has to do with not just your own life, but when you make a record, people listen to it. So it's Mm-Hmm. A life and their life, you know? You know, what is it that you wanna spread? What is it that you wanna encourage in other people? You know? That's the first thing I, I think about now. And we're living in an age that, because of technology change is happening at an unprecedented rate, and we all feel that. We all notice it, and it's creating a turmoil, because it's so difficult for older people to be able to kind of keep up, generally speaking. So, so the idea of staying in your comfort zone, that, that doesn't work. <laugh> doesn't even 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Exist anymore, I don't think. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herbie: </b><laugh>? Well, there are people living and breathing that their al <span style="color:red" data-ts="1463.245" data-end_ts="1463.485" title="1463.245" id=c_"1463.245">__cart__</span> is completely upset, right? Because it doesn't fit, like you say, into the comfort zone. And so what I try to do is encourage people to have the courage to remove the fences around that comfort zone, because human beings have infinite potential. And that infinite, infinite potential doesn't fit into a zone, right? There are no zones. See, but that's scary for a lot of people and difficult for them to accept. Right? But I think it's important. And, and I, what I try to do, what many people try to do is to live what you believe in, you know? And so I want to expand, I wanna try new things. I've gotten great encouragement for expanding and, and growing. And, and Donald Bird was one of the first to encourage that. Miles Davis was a, like a main person in encouraging that expansion. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herbie: </b>And <span style="color:red" data-ts="1529.545" data-end_ts="1529.765" title="1529.545" id=c_"1529.545">__dda__</span>, who's the, he's my life mentor. He's the president of the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1534.715" data-end_ts="1535.005" title="1534.715" id=c_"1534.715">__Soka__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1535.005" data-end_ts="1535.205" title="1535.005" id=c_"1535.005">__guy__</span>, or SGI organization that, that I belong to the Buddhist organization. And that's, that's like one of the main things is, is <span style="color:red" data-ts="1544.785" data-end_ts="1545.005" title="1544.785" id=c_"1544.785">__to__</span>, is that your, your life has no limits. And also it takes courage to step outside of what used to be comfortable. But you know what, when we come outta the womb, right? And we see people walking around on two legs, and we can't do that. We're crawling around. What do we do? We <span style="color:red" data-ts="1564.185" data-end_ts="1564.405" title="1564.185" id=c_"1564.185">__try__</span> to stand up on two legs. So what happens? We fall down, but we stay down. Nope. Again, we fall a lot of times until we get used to walking on two legs, that kind of courage to keep that throughout your whole life so that you're constantly expanding into areas where you may not be comfortable at first, but eventually you'll get there. What that does is that that builds your courage. That kind of experience is what actually keeps you young, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herbie: </b>So we never have to give in to being old. Yes, we have these numbers, right? But you can maintain that youthful spirit throughout your life, and that's by not giving in to just getting old, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? So what are, what are the things that you do that are, like right now, what are the things that you're doing to push your own envelope? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herbie: </b>Okay. By the way, I chant every day. That's, I chant <span style="color:red" data-ts="1623.525" data-end_ts="1623.725" title="1623.525" id=c_"1623.525">__numb__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1623.725" data-end_ts="1623.965" title="1623.725" id=c_"1623.725">__your__</span> whole rege every day. That's the practice in case somebody wanna know what it, what it is, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1628.745" data-end_ts="1628.965" title="1628.745" id=c_"1628.745">__it__</span>, there's a little more to it than that, you know? But there's a lot of details. If anybody's interested, go online, look up sgi.org. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herbie: </b>And, anyway, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1638.965" data-end_ts="1639.125" title="1638.965" id=c_"1638.965">__the__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1639.145" data-end_ts="1639.365" title="1639.145" id=c_"1639.145">__the__</span> lead 'em that 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Way, what are the things that you do to push yourself into, you know, to kind of be in this constant learning mode? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herbie: </b>It, it kind of happens automatically, because I'm curious <laugh>, and I'll hear about something like Bitcoins Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and cryptocurrency. And I wonder what is that? You know, <laugh>, and then I start investigating it and then kind of get into it, you know? So there <span style="color:red" data-ts="1672.485" data-end_ts="1672.605" title="1672.485" id=c_"1672.485">__are__</span> constantly influences from outside or from inside that stimulate me to try something I haven't tried before. Many times it's from another person. Life is full of stuff like that. You just have to be kind of open to it. And the things I'm learning now, I'm learning a lot from young people right now, because I really believe this is the age where they will be the primary movers. Many, many times people compare, are starting to compare this age now with the sixties. And in many ways, I, I understand that. 'cause I was around in the sixties. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, but I think this is gonna be like the sixties on steroids. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herbie: </b>You 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Know, very high velocity version of the sixties, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herbie: </b><laugh>. Yeah. Right. <laugh>, I mean, everything is disrupting, like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1730.675" data-end_ts="1730.965" title="1730.675" id=c_"1730.675">__mild__</span> killer. Yeah. Right? And, so many things that have been swept under the rug pertaining to civil rights, for example, race relations, sexism, xenophobia, I mean, there's so many things that maybe we thought many people thought <span style="color:red" data-ts="1751.145" data-end_ts="1751.365" title="1751.145" id=c_"1751.145">__was__</span> solved. They haven't been solved, you know, but, and so things, and there's a lot of divisive elements that are going around. We all know that this is, there's a lot of fear that's happening. And so there are so many things that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1769.685" data-end_ts="1769.965" title="1769.685" id=c_"1769.685">__would__</span> need to be fixed, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herbie: </b>But the main thing that actually I wanna focus on, on, on my record is that our worst enemy is ourselves. You know? So fixing is oneself is prob, that's probably a bad choice of words to say fix, actually transforming right? Yourself. Like owning what your issues are, admitting them to yourself and working on improving oneself, is, is what we need to do, right? So that we can continue to be a part of the force that moves humanity forward. That's what we're all here for. We do it in various ways, right? Everybody's got a purpose and everybody needs everybody else. Some people who are bad, as opposed to some people who are good. You know what I always say? <laugh>, if you wanna see a bad person look in the mirror, right? Wanna see a good person look in the mirror, also. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Look in the mirror, right? Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herbie: </b>We all have both those tendencies, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1843.925" data-end_ts="1844.215" title="1843.925" id=c_"1843.925">__when__</span> we need those, we actually need to have issues because that's the only way you can grow, right? And we need to have these battles with yourself in order to improve your life. We need that to develop courage, compassion, empathy, understanding another person's life. If you got issues, you can understand another person having issues. And instead of just like pointing fingers at them, you can have your thumb pointing at you at the same time and say, you know, we can, we can work together. You know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I sometimes wonder in, in our, in our rush to try and tamp down every conflict that there is, you know, especially in our own minds. I wonder if sometimes we aren't turning off the mechanisms that allowed us to change for the better. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herbie: </b>That's a very, very important, observation you made. Because I mean, it, it coincides with what I, what I said is that we need to have the bad side so that we can convert the bad side into like, for each issue that we have to deal with, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1913.475" data-end_ts="1913.695" title="1913.475" id=c_"1913.475">__to__</span> convert that into something that we can actually use to move forward. Because 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That negative side tends to have a lot of power, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herbie: </b><laugh>. Yeah. Right. <laugh>. And, and the, and the more we move forward, the more resistance we'll get from, in Buddhism, we call it our fundamental darkness. Okay? So we have our fundamental enlightenment and our fundamental darkness. The object is to transform yourself so that you can find the way to transform fundamental darkness into fundamental enlightenment. You know? So in each case, seeing things from a different standpoint, we're capable of doing that. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, but it hangs, hangs us up, is when an issue comes out from us that we just see it from one standpoint. But if we can realize that there's more than one way to look at something, you know, there is a pathway to being able to turn that into something that moves us forward, right? That's how jazz was invented. Yeah. That's how the blues was invented. It came out of cotton fields and slavery and racial injustice, you know? And look what that led to led to rock and roll jazz and still growing. You 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Certainly give some encouragement given the, the sense of dark days ahead, right? That this <laugh>, you know, pointing, pointing to the fact that there's value to be gained from even confronting these things is pretty great. Our time is almost up, but before we go, I mean, first of all, people are gonna browbeat me because I didn't spend enough time talking about voltage control of filter cutoffs, <laugh>. So I apologize to everyone on there, but you know what, there's plenty of people that'll talk to us about, about CV control, and there's not many people that can tell us what's in your head, Herbie. So I appreciate you letting me kind of riff on this stuff. It's really interesting. I would like to know one last thing. You are probably in one of the most unique positions in the world, in, in general, but especially in technology and especially in music technology, to kind of have to be able to kind of get a whiff of what the future looks like. From your perspective, what do you feel like the, the world's, the future's gonna look like? For us? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herbie: </b>It's gonna be really interesting. And, and by the way, a lot of people talking about the future, and there are a lot of right I believe answers, you know, to what's gonna happen. And we can see virtual reality is leading us into a whole new realm of virtual worlds that can go in many different directions. The idea of the singularity that actually has several definitions, but one of 'em is that as time progresses and the development of artificial intelligence continues to evolve, and, we're seeing the use of of new kinds of prosthetics for people who are losing their limbs, we are going to have the opportunity to become partly robots ourselves. There may be a, a time when we may be able to kind of patch into a whole new realm of interaction with, with <span style="color:red" data-ts="2116.815" data-end_ts="2116.935" title="2116.815" id=c_"2116.815">__a__</span>, the intelligence that's in the cloud that perhaps is in part what will in parts of development be due to robots and artificial intelligence itself. Its own further development. I, I guess that's the kind of evolution I've seen. We've seen <span style="color:red" data-ts="2135.455" data-end_ts="2135.575" title="2135.455" id=c_"2135.455">__a__</span>, a lot of movies and, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2136.755" data-end_ts="2136.975" title="2136.755" id=c_"2136.755">__and__</span>, maybe TV shows about things like that. I, I believe that that would be, will be our future if we survive as a, as a planet or interplanetary species. And Elon Musk is right. We do need to explore other planets. I I'm just afraid that we have to learn to take care of this planet before we screw up another one. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. We have to learn to be good janitors before we can be CEOs, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herbie: </b>Yeah. But I think, I really do think that kind of difficult times that we <span style="color:red" data-ts="2167.685" data-end_ts="2167.925" title="2167.685" id=c_"2167.685">__live__</span>, live in are a launching <span style="color:red" data-ts="2170.265" data-end_ts="2170.485" title="2170.265" id=c_"2170.265">__pat__</span> platform for a much greater evolution of humanity toward one of ethics and humanitarian values. We have to go through this in order to get there, but we haven't been able to see a lot of the issues before. Now we're seeing them coming out <span style="color:red" data-ts="2192.505" data-end_ts="2192.725" title="2192.505" id=c_"2192.505">__and__</span> droves, but the revolution is already happening, and it's in various ways, not just left. Values <span style="color:red" data-ts="2203.225" data-end_ts="2203.445" title="2203.225" id=c_"2203.225">__are__</span> right and the right values are wrong. Left values are often blind to what the right issues are. We've seen that in American politics. So there's a lot of stuff we are being faced with now, but the only way you can solve a problem is to see it in the first place. So I think this is the, the storm before the dawn. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, Herbie, I want to thank you so much for, again, taking the time. It was fabulous to get to just kind of peer inside your brain and, and learn a little bit more about how you think about your own creative process and your interaction with the world. This, this concept of focusing on connectivity, I think that we all get better if we can put some of our own focus on that as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herbie: </b>That's why the source, the source is life, creativity that is all around you. The stimulation is there. That's, that's the main point I wanted to bring up. Awesome. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, thank you so much, and with that, I'll let you have the rest of your day. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herbie: </b>Great. All thanks. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Many thanks to Herbie Hancock for the great discussion. We were all over the map on that one. It was fantastic. I want to thank you with the listeners for showing up and listening to this stuff. It's been fantastic to have you on board. Please do me a favor and give me a thumbs up on Facebook or a, like on iTunes or whatever the hell you do with these things. Just gimme some props just because it helps other people find the podcast, and that's very helpful. I also want to thank all of the friends and family that have helped with this, including my buddies at 20 objects, all the folks at Cycling 74, my friends at opia. Great work that Peter Kern's doing at CDM and everything that everybody's doing. I really appreciate all the support I've gotten over the years. With that, I'm gonna let you go and catch you next week. Bye.
