<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today is a very special interview for me. We get to speak to somebody whose work I've kind of followed for a while. I really like the things that he, he does. I like the collab collaborations he's involved in. His name is Marcus Reuter. We just talked about him a a little bit ago when we did a interview with Tobias Reber. I'm very excited to get a chance to talk, talk to Marcus Reuter. Hey, Marcus. How's it going? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus Reuter: </b>Hey, I'm fine, thank you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Why don't we start this off by having you tell us a little bit about what you're up to right now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>I'm currently on tour with, pro Rock Trio, called Stickman with Tony Levin and Pat Masato. And we just started touring two days ago and we're, playing mostly on the East Coast and Canada, and then in the Midwest. It's, it's like a five week tour total for me. And it's really, it's really going wonderfully well, like even after the first couple shows, I think we have the material back. 'cause, you know, with an international trio like this, we hardly ever get time to properly rehearse. So, but we're getting better at just, you know, not starting all over again every time we get together. But we're, you know, basically even getting better as a band as we, as we continue playing <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm sure you get to kind of build on your previous work, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>Yes. Yeah. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's pretty cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>It's so much fun. And I have to say, like, just just before we started talking, there's, there's a piece where we have like a, like a three against seven poly rhythm Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, and I actually wrote that as some sort of exercise for myself in a way. And then Tony's the guy playing that part on stage. But it's amazing how, like, if you, play something that actually used to be some sort of study or exercise piece in front of people for 500 times <laugh>, how suddenly you really, really know what you're doing <laugh>. And it really becomes part of, and and that's, that's really like something I, I really enjoy about, live performance is that I also consider it to be some sort of a tool for personal development. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So, you've been working with Pat Masto for a while, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>Yes. Since two, 2005 actually. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>When did Tony Levin get into, into the mix on that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>How did you meet him? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>Yeah, I mean, the funny thing is, like, I had met him a couple times before that, but that was mostly with, some under a misunderstanding involved <laugh>, where, where somehow, like I was following him to his hotel because it was also my hotel and stuff. Oh. And, <span style="color:red" data-ts="182.385" data-end_ts="182.605" title="182.385" id=c_"182.385">__and__</span> no, but, but anyway, I got, got recommended to Tony by the California Guitar Trio in 2010. And when in in Stickman there was, another player before me and, and the California Guitar Trio recommended me. And obviously <span style="color:red" data-ts="197.865" data-end_ts="198.085" title="197.865" id=c_"197.865">__Pad__</span> had played with me before. So it was, and I mean, it, it's, it's interesting, when Tony and I first met, we, we really basically on that first day, we wrote the biggest hits that we're still playing two audiences. And, it, it went very well. And he's, he's classically trained. I'm classically trained and, yeah. I mean, we really like each other. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That's, that's cool. Well, it's funny because, there's something about, the, the, the stick <span style="color:red" data-ts="230.425" data-end_ts="230.645" title="230.425" id=c_"230.425">__men__</span>, combo that the internet thinks is something I'd really like right. <laugh>, because like, whether it's Facebook or, you know, different, different search engines or whatever, they always are recommending when you're, when you're touring or when, when a new YouTube video comes up or whatever. For some reason, it's like that combination of people and the music and stuff, it knows that that's what I want, which on one hand is nice, on the other hand, is a little creepy that it follows me that closely <laugh>, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>Yeah. It is, it is creepy, but it, it does, does work. And it's almost like by what you're typing on <span style="color:red" data-ts="269.645" data-end_ts="269.845" title="269.645" id=c_"269.645">__your__</span> computer, right? <span style="color:red" data-ts="270.945" data-end_ts="271.165" title="270.945" id=c_"270.945">__So__</span> the internet can, can predict what you're thinking somehow. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. It's pretty, pretty crazy. Yeah. Now you've, you've also, already have had, you're like one of the most prolific people that I've ever seen, you know, has ever come on my radar and Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So you've actually had a bunch of releases already come out this year. The collaboration you did with Robert Rich Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> <span style="color:red" data-ts="296.395" data-end_ts="296.685" title="296.395" id=c_"296.395">__Lift__</span> the Feather to the Flood. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That came out I think in April, maybe. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And I think you had at least one solo work come out too, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>Yeah. That was, falling for Ascension. Yes. Which I recorded with, Tobias <span style="color:red" data-ts="313.345" data-end_ts="313.625" title="313.345" id=c_"313.345">__Reva__</span> and a group called Sonar, and it's out on Nick B's, Ron Rhythm Records label. Then there is an album with Pat Masto called Face, one of my major works, I'd say. Okay. I took, took 10 ti 10 years to complete. The thing is that, you know, I think that this year has seen a lot of my, what I would consider my best music yet. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, but some of which has been sitting around for a few years. So it's not like, like what it looks like to people from the outside that I'm kind of always busy. I try to work, regularly. That's, not a question, but, you know, some, projects, they're just sitting on shelves for, for a while, and then, as the opportunity arises to release them, they get released. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>And that's why sometimes there are clusters of releases coming out. Sure. And, and also I have, I have never been part of the <span style="color:red" data-ts="368.825" data-end_ts="369.045" title="368.825" id=c_"368.825">__tra__</span> traditional music business, which I think is, is a very good thing for me. And so I have always had the freedom. It didn't matter if there was demand for what I was doing. And I didn't, I didn't ever even consider that there would be some sort of demand for what I do, <laugh>. I, you know, it Yeah. It's true. I always thought that I'm an artist in the sense of fine arts, even, you know, it's not, I I never ever really considered myself to be a musician or performer in the first place. More an explorer, a scientist, an artist in that regard. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, it's interesting you say it that way because first of all, you know, over the history of musicians, there has been sort of like the patronage model where people were support the artists in the same way that for at least some small period of time, record companies supported musicians. Right? Yeah. But it's interesting that you put it, that you're almost an ex calling yourself an explorer seems to make a lot of sense to me because you do kind of push envelopes and you do it in your way. You don't necessarily chase the market around. Right. You instead do what your soul tells you to do. And you hope that people listen to it. Now, does it seem like people are actually kind of coming to appreciate your style of music more now? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>I think so. I think so. So <span style="color:red" data-ts="455.305" data-end_ts="455.525" title="455.305" id=c_"455.305">__how__</span>, however, it's still a very, very small group. Or at least let's say, it's, it's only a very small group that I, that I know of. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know, I, I'm, I'm pretty sure there <span style="color:red" data-ts="470.365" data-end_ts="470.525" title="470.365" id=c_"470.365">__is__</span> some un let's just call it underground <laugh> movement of people who listen to my music or however, you know, like, like it's, it's still really, really small. On one hand, it's scary. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, on the other hand, it, it inspired, it inspired me to just change my, my business model a little bit. And I've just started, a subscription service to my music. And I'm also in the process of withdrawing, some releases from the public, which I think is the right way for me to go, because I don't expect to have a breakthrough by somebody discovering my music by chance. You know, that's, it's just not, not happening that way <span style="color:red" data-ts="513.995" data-end_ts="514.285" title="513.995" id=c_"513.995">__with__</span>, with the way that the, internet works, as <span style="color:red" data-ts="517.125" data-end_ts="517.285" title="517.125" id=c_"517.125">__the__</span>, as a distribution system, you know, it's, you know, it's, it's the big illusion that the internet is, is just like, I mean, it is a blessing for me. It certainly is a blessing, but also it, it, it sets limits that you cannot really easily pass without, without lots of money. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. So when you say that, so this is very interesting 'cause I noticed on your website you have this VIP membership thing. Yeah. Which is sort of like an opportunity for your fans to sort of engage with your, your music directly get Yes. Get specific releases, get unreleased material and stuff like that. When you talk about pulling some of your stuff from public availability, is it to refocus that to your membership? Or is it just simply to try and reduce, to reduce the amount of stuff that's out there so that people aren't sick of you by the time they come to your site? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>Exactly. It's both uhhuh, <affirmative>, it's both. Yeah. And that, that's the whole idea that it allows me to choose how I want to be represented in the public or what kind of, what side of my music I want to see represented in the public. And then <span style="color:red" data-ts="592.185" data-end_ts="592.405" title="592.185" id=c_"592.185">__the__</span>, those people that know about me and know about the range of the stuff that I'm doing, they can sign up to my page and they will get all sorts of stuff, like all live recordings. And I mean, the, the thing is that nowadays, and, and since I've developed my, you know, as a musician and producer, so much over the years, whenever I make a live recording, it, it usually is, it usually is good enough to be put out as an album. And when I say good enough, I'm not, I'm, that's, it actually means it's gr it's great. I don't want to really say that about myself, but that's, that's the, the, the challenge I have. Like, you know, like when I sit down and play, it's usually very, very good. And 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and, and now the technology is such too, so that not only does the, you know, is the performance likely to be good, but also it's, it was probably recorded sufficiently well Yes. That it would be a useful release. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>Exactly. That's what I mean, you know, like everything nowadays, everything like technology and also, skill comes together in me in such a way that it's, it's just presenting me with new challenges. And I think that this VIP, subscription model is, is a very good way to be able, to focus, you know, like what I'm focused, <span style="color:red" data-ts="674.085" data-end_ts="674.365" title="674.085" id=c_"674.085">__that__</span> just the, what I want to, project to the outside Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and still, and still have the, the wide variety, variety of output, or make a wide variety of <span style="color:red" data-ts="686.205" data-end_ts="686.405" title="686.205" id=c_"686.205">__opera__</span> available to those who really already are introduced to me, you know, have been introduced to me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I like that as an idea too, because it means that you don't have the opportunity of like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="702.675" data-end_ts="702.965" title="702.675" id=c_"702.675">__have__</span> this idea of like kind of maintaining or controlling how people are gonna see you from the outside, and then once they're drawn in, being able to open up a lot of yourself. 'cause sometimes I always worry that it's like, you know, if just for fun, I did something that was just sort of like a silly music track, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I'm almost scared to have it be available anywhere in case somebody listens to that as the first time that they hear my name 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>Yes. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And then, and then they're like, oh, I just really hate that guy's stuff. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b><laugh>, you know? Yeah. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Or, or I do something so experimental and then like, you know, a lot of people are just like, well, I can't even make sense of his puzzle pieces. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>Exactly. And you know, what I find interesting is, you've just been comparing, pieces of music that you did. Right. However, if you're, if you're, if you're thinking more about it, like, like people who listen to music, what they do is they, they come up with an idea about you as a person, right? They, they are drawing conclusions from the music. And that was like a few years ago, that was a big revelation to me, where I was trying to put myself into the listener's position. I was thinking, okay, if I, if I was to hear this music, what would I think about that person? And, and that was interesting, like where, you know, sometimes some, some people gave me feedback like, oh, this music sounds cold to me, or whatever, stuff like that. And I can, I can also see that some of the music that I, that I'm making maybe has this sort of distant feel to it. And I'm, I'm talking about like emotionally Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And the funny thing is that, that as a person, I'm actually, I'm quite the opposite. Like, just let, let's just say people like fall in love with me very easily. I have, I'm a very generous person, you know, and I, I'm, I'm always there for people. And it's kind of interesting that my, my art is generally projecting a completely different image. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It makes sense because when I listen, whether I'm listening to music or I'm listening to someone on a podcast, or I'm, or I'm reading someone's book or whatever, I am developing a mental image of what that person is like. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>Yes, exactly. And I think that what I need to do is to use that to my advantage. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So just knowing that my music does feel cold to some people, I, I think it's a good thing. Like if you're looking at the contemporary art, fine arts world, you know, I'm, I'm sure a lot of, what I describe as happening there, like, you know, some people just working with, let's just say very cold surfaces, let's say Chrome or Rusty iron or whatever, you know, you would, you would, you would think, you know, you, you'd get a certain image about a person, but there's really no relationship, I think. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, the other thing that, that I think is kind of interesting is that if there's a, if there is a difference between the person and the work, I think it actually makes both more interesting. Maybe, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="900.295" data-end_ts="900.785" title="900.295" id=c_"900.295">__because__</span> Yeah. 'cause you're like, well, that's really interesting that a person who I found very warm is doing something that sounds cold or vice versa. Yes. And I wonder what that represents, and I wonder, how can I hear the warmth in what I originally perceived <span style="color:red" data-ts="915.105" data-end_ts="915.305" title="915.105" id=c_"915.105">__as__</span> coldness and stuff like that. It makes for a more complex, context, I think. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>Exactly. Exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's really interesting. So you're, as an instrumentalist, you are primarily known as a touch guitarist? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I mean, to the point where you actually have an instrument that you help design. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>Yes. It's been an interesting journey for me. I started out as a purely a music lover, a composer, let's say, you know, of my love for music triggered the idea that I wanted to create music that I needed to hear. So I became a composer. And that was at, at a very young age. Like, the, the album Falling for Ascension that I mentioned earlier. I, you know, those motifs used for that album, were written when I was 13 or something. So like in 85 or something, it was, it's very interesting. I've been a composer first. And then I, you know, I studied a little bit of classical guitar, but I never, never practiced. I was just like, talented enough to, to know how to read music, and I could play a little, but I never practiced the instrument from a technical point of view. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>In 1991, I ended up going to a guitar craft course with Robert Tripp, and that really changed my world a little bit because I learned about, practicing there and what it does and what it can do for you. And that was still, with an acoustic guitar. However, I spoke with Robert then, and I, I got the idea because I liked, like Tony Levins playing back then already, like, on, on King Crims and tracks, like Elephant Talk, for example. And, and so I asked Robert about, about playing the stick, and he said that he likes it very much, and then if, if he were younger, he would, he would love to play the stick. And, and so somehow that inspired me to, to pick up the stick. I got, got a, a spare one from <span style="color:red" data-ts="1031.745" data-end_ts="1031.945" title="1031.745" id=c_"1031.745">__gon__</span> back then, and I started, I started playing the Stick. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>The interesting thing was that, and it still is interesting, that there hasn't been like a, a musical tradition for the touch style instrument. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, just to use a more general term. Right. The way that Emma Chapman approached it, that he, he kind of suggested to people how to play it, which, which somehow I thought was a problem because I, I was even in the, in my first year of having the instrument, I went to, several workshops and I saw that people were hitting a ceiling very, very quickly with that instrument. And that made me very, very sad because I really was so in love with the idea of the instrument that, seeing people fail at actually playing music on it, just to oversimplify things. It was, was really hurting me. And so I had to make, make a decision, you know, either I really go for it and I see this as my research project, or I, I drop it completely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>And I stayed with it. I developed my, let's just, let's just say the technique for the instrument. I started, started exploring how do you actually make <span style="color:red" data-ts="1104.885" data-end_ts="1105.005" title="1104.885" id=c_"1104.885">__a__</span> play a note here? How do you start a note? How do you stop a note? How do you play a loud note? How do you play a soft note? <span style="color:red" data-ts="1110.905" data-end_ts="1111.125" title="1110.905" id=c_"1110.905">__And__</span> people had never thought about those things before. Interestingly enough, I mean, and yeah. But, but the stick had only been around for 20 years then, so <laugh>, anyway, so it was, it was really, like pioneering work I did there. And it's really great that after, almost 25 years of playing, I've developed a very efficient system where I can show people even in one lesson what they need to learn in order to understand what makes the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1139.885" data-end_ts="1140.365" title="1139.885" id=c_"1139.885">__touchdown__</span> instrument the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1140.925" data-end_ts="1141.365" title="1140.925" id=c_"1140.925">__touchdown__</span> instrument. 'cause it, you know, it's also misleading because people look at it and they think it's a guitar, it's a bass, or maybe some people say it's more like a piano. Right. But it's, it's neither of those. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Well, so I, I have, boy, that just launches me into like 50 different questions I'd like to ask, but let me start off with this. In watching people work with the stick, you said that they hit a ceiling relatively quickly. What was the cause of the ceilings? Was it, was it playing technique, or was it the layout of the instrument, or it was, was it choices that Chapman had made? What, what did you think was the limiting factors? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>It's a combination of things. First of all, it's, it's basically two sets of strings on one F thread <span style="color:red" data-ts="1188.725" data-end_ts="1189.005" title="1188.725" id=c_"1188.725">__board__</span>. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And you have, separate outputs for those. So basically that already suggests that you kind of have to play two parts at the same time. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>Okay. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1200.395" data-end_ts="1200.685" title="1200.395" id=c_"1200.395">__Yeah__</span>. It's that, that's not a bad thing I'm just describing. Yeah. And, and also it has <span style="color:red" data-ts="1206.205" data-end_ts="1206.405" title="1206.205" id=c_"1206.205">__the__</span> a fourth tuning, and a fifth tuning combined on one neck. Back then it had either, 10 or 12 strings. Right. Then there there are the, just say like the, the physical ergonomics of the instrument, which were and are not ideal. I think. So for example, the Chapman stick is attached to the body with the bell hook, which is, which is stiff. So it basically, the instrument does not move on your body. And, and I can, I can see what the idea is behind that. Right. However, it really does not represent what, like a musical instrument usually is. A musical instrument is meant to, vibrate and oscillate, and it's, it's also meant to vibrate oscillate with you. Right. And so if it's fixed to your body, it just makes things harder. I was thinking about it, like, and I think the only other musical instrument that's really fixed to your, body is a, a Glock <span style="color:red" data-ts="1263.825" data-end_ts="1264.025" title="1263.825" id=c_"1263.825">__and__</span> spiel in a marching band. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. I, yeah. My son was in a marching band in the glockenspiel. And then the, those like quad drums are attached to the body, and that, that is about it. <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>You know, I think it's just that the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1277.905" data-end_ts="1278.065" title="1277.905" id=c_"1277.905">__cha__</span> I, I really have to say I love the idea of the Chapman stick. I think the desire of the Chapman stick, like visually <span style="color:red" data-ts="1284.685" data-end_ts="1284.905" title="1284.685" id=c_"1284.685">__is__</span> cool and appealing. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. However, that's also the factor that since it is, it's looking so cool, and it sounds so cool. Yeah. It has this, this let's say, one great sound, and I love that. However, that is also stopping people from, actually making music with it, because you just need to put your fingers down and move them, or just play a few notes without moving up and down the strings and you get something that sounds cool. Right. And, and that's also a problem, you know, because you just, just imagine if you have a stick, you are cool already. You don't need to learn to play <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>Yeah. It's, it's a simple <span style="color:red" data-ts="1321.795" data-end_ts="1322.145" title="1321.795" id=c_"1321.795">__psych__</span>, psychological thing that's happening there. Right. That stops people. So that's why when I started developing my instrument 10 years ago, I went to the Luther that I worked with and I said, I would like our instrument to be, to look a hundred percent like a traditional instrument, right. Like a traditional guitar instrument. And I want you, you Luther, to only use traditional techniques to build this instrument, et cetera. And so that's how my instrument, the touch guitars <span style="color:red" data-ts="1353.345" data-end_ts="1353.465" title="1353.345" id=c_"1353.345">__you__</span> ate was developed. Obviously we keep improving on it, but the original concept of making it like a traditional guitar instrument that belongs to the guitar family, that was a very, very good call because, you know, people pick up the instrument. It's extremely ergonomic, it moves really on the body. It has a great sound. It it gives you access to more traditional guitar and bass sounds as well. And when people pick it up, they just start playing. And it's always a joy to see, that this, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1386.375" data-end_ts="1386.665" title="1386.375" id=c_"1386.375">__some__</span>, some of the obstacles that I saw the stick introducing have, have been lifted. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Now that's, that's a really interesting way to go, because one of the things I noticed even on the touch guitar site is that they have, they show people that use it as if it's almost like a standard guitar, like holding it and playing it in that way, and other people who approach it almost like a stick, you know, playing their hands up the neck and stuff. And that. Now I understand the importance of that because you felt like with the Chapman stick, that sort of like demanding, demanding a certain kind of playing and even the two output system and stuff implied a certain result and, and didn't allow the individual musician to come through. That's Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's an interesting perspective. And it's especially interesting considering your work, because if I li when I listen to your work, you have some stuff, especially when you're playing in Prague, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1452.605" data-end_ts="1452.885" title="1452.605" id=c_"1452.605">__like__</span> groups Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you have this very intricate shaped and designed sound and output in other cases, like when you do the collaborations with Robert Rich or with Ian Bode Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you have a very obt smooth glassy or glassy almost, quality to things. You know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1473.985" data-end_ts="1474.205" title="1473.985" id=c_"1473.985">__you__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1474.205" data-end_ts="1474.325" title="1474.205" id=c_"1474.205">__are__</span>, it, it seems like you're able to take the techniques and the instrument and apply it in many different ways. And so that helps me understand why you went down the route of, of designing your own instrument 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>Correctly. And, and also, as you know, you can see that the music is, is first for me Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I mean, that, that's really what makes the instrument that I designed such a great instrument because I really don't have much of an attachment to the instrument as an invention, rather than as a tool, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>As a tool for expression. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>Yes. Yes. And that's, that's really the big difference. I mean, like, if, you know, and if people ask me, Hey, what's the difference between your touch instrument and other touch instruments? And like, really the the most honest answer is, my instrument was actually was developed by somebody who plays music. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>You know, and that, that just makes a huge difference. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>How is like the U eight instrument, how is that, how does that different, obviously the eight represents, it has eight strings, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>How is it different from a standard guitar? Is it like tuned in straight forth or something? What is, what is like the primary differences as a, if a guitarist was gonna approach this instrument, what's the primary differences? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>Okay. The, the primary differences are that it's an eight string, guitar, or you could say baritone kind of guitar that has a base scale length and, has a wide, range of nodes available. And it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1578.925" data-end_ts="1579.085" title="1578.925" id=c_"1578.925">__two__</span> fifths. So the lowest string is a, is a low B flat that's below a six string bass even Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, and goes up to a high D, which is the 22nd fret on an electric guitar. Oh my, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>One of the really cool things that, that Emma Chapman also thought about was to have a part of the stick <span style="color:red" data-ts="1597.775" data-end_ts="1598.125" title="1597.775" id=c_"1597.775">__tuned__</span> in fifths. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. However, the way that he set it up is with the base string in the middle. So, basically the strings get higher towards you on the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1609.445" data-end_ts="1609.645" title="1609.445" id=c_"1609.445">__base__</span> side of the stick. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And so, so I, I could see the benefits of that tuning, immediately when I got the instrument. And what I did is I just simply turned things around and put it in the traditional order with the low strings being closer to me and the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1626.285" data-end_ts="1626.445" title="1626.285" id=c_"1626.285">__high__</span> strings further away from me. And the instruments <span style="color:red" data-ts="1629.205" data-end_ts="1629.365" title="1629.205" id=c_"1629.205">__stood__</span> mostly in fifth. And what it does, I mean, if you, if you think about we have, we have four fingers per hand, and the way that I want to want to approach a musical instrument is with all eight fingers, almost as if it was one hand. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>That's how great piano players play. You know, they don't think in terms of the left hand is always playing a bass part, right. Or the right hand's always playing a chords or a melo melodic part. It's, it's, that's just the physical limitation because you have the low notes on the left and the high notes on the right. However, with the touch guitar instrument, since it's basically many keyboards Yeah. It's, it's multiple strings. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, which, which have ascending pitches on them. That's why you can completely forget about the concept of, register, attached to a certain hand. And, and that's why I'm the fifth tuning is so great because just if you're, if you're putting, just imagine like of, eight half steps make <span style="color:red" data-ts="1697.805" data-end_ts="1697.925" title="1697.805" id=c_"1697.805">__a__</span> fifth interval. So that means with four, with four fingers per hand, you're covering, if you're putting the hands next to each other, you're covering the interval of a fifth on a single string. And that means if the instrument would be tuned in fourth, you'd be playing diagonally going up to the headstock, and you would rather, rather quickly, fall off the fretboard. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, I was gonna say, you run out of real estate. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>Exactly. And with the, with the fifth tuning, basically it's, you're going diagonal up the neck with gravity, let's say. Yeah. Yeah. And, and it's just the most wonderful feeling, and it has such a great open sound. The, the intervals and the overtones are slightly sharp because of the fifth intervals. Mm-Hmm. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1741.125" data-end_ts="1741.165" title="1741.125" id=c_"1741.125">__<affirmative>__</span>. So it has, it has that really, really beautiful ringing sound to <span style="color:red" data-ts="1744.525" data-end_ts="1744.645" title="1744.525" id=c_"1744.525">__it__</span>. And also since we are like on a normal guitar, the fifth tuning is, is pretty limiting because you cannot reach, easily reach all intervals with just fretting with the left hand. But if you're fretting and touching with both <span style="color:red" data-ts="1759.165" data-end_ts="1759.405" title="1759.165" id=c_"1759.165">__hands__</span> at the same time, you have access to all the intervals easily. So it's really the perfect tuning for a touch style instrument. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. I was gonna ask if why you wouldn't have just approached using a standard guitar with fifths. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>Yeah. I mean, if you're playing touch style on a standard guitar, then that's not a problem. Right. However, if you're, if you're picking and fretting, just, just some things are, are very, very hard and almost impossible to do. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Yeah, that makes sense. Very interesting. So now as we've been talking, you've, you've talked about how you had some classical training, how you were talented enough to kind of make it through until you went to this, guitar craft course, which kind of opened your head to a new way of thinking. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But, I'm curious, the, the other thing I would say about you is that you, you seem to have a very adventurous ear, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I mean, I've heard you again, I, so often I've heard you in collaborate collaborative work, right? Yeah. 'cause you collaborate a lot. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But one of the things I would say is that you seem to not be worried about putting yourself in a lot of different musical contexts, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And that implies to me that, that your background, in addition to being one of learning to play an instrument, you're not just sort of like a technique monkey, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you are a very thoughtful, and, and very, I would say, very ear oriented player. I always hear you slot yourself in really nicely. What, in your background, put you in a position to be comfortable in so many musical environments? I mean, did you, growing up, were you around a lot of music or was this something that just you've developed over time? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah. I think there's, there's, a combination of things that, that led to where I am now. So, first of all, in the, I was born in the early seventies, and my mother was listening to the radio all the time, and she was making mixtapes, recording from the radio and stuff like that. And so, a lot of the classic music from the, from the seventies is part of my DNA Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I remember that like the first vinyl that I ever put on was the, the White Album by the Beatles. I'm not a big Beatles fan, but somehow, like, there's this, a lot of the musical tradition and, you know, like The Beatles were such an adventurous band already, that that gave me a good start. Right. However, it really was the discovery of Mike Oldfield's music that, led me on this path. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>And, and I'm not sure how familiar you are with Mike <span style="color:red" data-ts="1923.485" data-end_ts="1923.885" title="1923.485" id=c_"1923.485">__Oldfield__</span> music, he put out a box set, which had like his first three albums plus an album, funnily enough, called Collaborations <laugh>, that has him playing with other people. And in particular with David Bedford. David Bedford, was a contemporary classical composer, I think one of the greatest, greatest composers, of the last 30, 40 years, let's say. I really, really fell in love with this music. And it, it, it already had this, this attitude of exploration and also combination of orchestral sounds and electric guitar and, children voices, you know, professional musicians and, amateurs. You know, everything I like about music where, where basically you can, you can bring anything into the mix to create an exciting sound. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1977.795" data-end_ts="1978.085" title="1977.795" id=c_"1977.795">__Okay__</span>. You know, I first listened to, an Extract from Stars, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1981.585" data-end_ts="1981.805" title="1981.585" id=c_"1981.585">__and__</span> which is one of, David Bedford's great pieces, when I was 10 years old. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>And then, then suddenly <span style="color:red" data-ts="1988.085" data-end_ts="1988.205" title="1988.085" id=c_"1988.085">__I__</span>, you know, I, I was lucky that I had a piano teacher for just maybe, maybe six months or so. I was actually learning to play keyboard, you know, plastic keyboard. And I had, I was lucky that I had a teacher who introduced me to Oli. So, I, I learned about the really cutting edge music at a very, very young age. And that's, I guess why I developed the open ear early on, even before I became, or I, I, I got to the age where I had to kind of decide what I wanted to do with my life. And I think it's also that, that basically my ear from, you know, from birth, my ear is not, it hasn't been very good. And I had to work to open it up myself. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, and so that's, that really was the foundation. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>But when it comes to, 'cause you were also connecting that to playing, the instrument. When I started, exploring the technique on the, on the touch instrument, what I did was I, I decided from the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2055.045" data-end_ts="2055.205" title="2055.045" id=c_"2055.045">__very__</span>, very beginning that I did not want to learn to play music on it. I, I never wanted to learn scales or anything. I just wanted to learn how to move on the fretboard. Hmm. I, I, I saw the fretboard like a, like a stage, and my fingers are dancers who wanna be able to go from A to B, in a beautiful way. And it didn't really matter what, what notes were under the fingers, you know, it was more about the movement. And that's how I developed my physical being to be able to just freely move, which then led to, led to the, the fact that I can just, you know, if inspiration strikes, I can just move my fingers and music comes out of me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>And I'm, I don't, I, I am very good at knowing what I'm playing, but I don't have to, you know, I can switch that completely off. I can just go for a gestural approach. And, and it's so interesting because like, like some of the music, some of my music that sounds very, very structured or very, very, thought through is actually improvised or, you know, has been done without knowing what I'm doing, let's say. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and, and vice versa. I, I really love exploring, the extremes. You know, I love bringing things together that normally wouldn't fit. And so each collaboration I'm involved with puts me into a different, into a different field of challenge. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You know, I, I studied and I studied hard as a guitarist for years. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I got to where I had very good facility and very good technique on the instrument. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative>. But I always struggled to find a, find a way to attach that to my musicality. And I never really thought about it being that practicing the movement, practicing or thinking, thinking outside of the terms of, you know, bang out a scale as quickly and as technically precise as possible. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> was, you know, the important thing to worry about. I mean, and in a way, if you take a look at like, the way that musicians are being taught, like through internet courses or whatever, it seems to be all about physicality and all about technique and very little about, Hey, stop and think about the music that you're actually trying to create. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>Yeah. But, you know, but you know what, it's actually, I agree with you, but the way that it looks like from the outside is the opposite. Because what people are trying to teach you technique via music, via musical examples. So because they think that their students need to have a success early on, you know, so, so they teach you how to play, I don't know, cashmere by Led Zeppelin. Yeah. Okay. Right. So rather than letting the student develop the strength in the fingers to get a good sound to play kir, let's say Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, they let them play kir without the student having any facility with the instrument. And what that leads to is some sort of frustration. Yeah. That sound is coming from my fingers, however, it doesn't feel good to me. Yeah. And that is a problem also, if you think about it, the things that sound good to us are the things that we already know <laugh>. So, so that means like, it's, there's very 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Little challenge involved, right? Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>But it's not just about the challenge, it's about that you're, you're putting a, a limitation on yourself, or the teacher puts a limitation on what your <span style="color:red" data-ts="2273.145" data-end_ts="2273.365" title="2273.145" id=c_"2273.145">__ear__</span>, what your ear and also your, your body is, is allowed to experience. Right. And that's one of the biggest problems <span style="color:red" data-ts="2280.765" data-end_ts="2280.965" title="2280.765" id=c_"2280.765">__in__</span> music education is, is that people are trying to teach, or are teaching how to create, recreate a certain sound. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> that's what like a lot of jazz is about, or jazz teaching is about jazz education is about how can I recreate the sound of a Charlie Parker solo. So, scholars have analyzed what Charlie Parker has been doing and put that into a system, you know, even though, like Charlie Parker would've never, ever thought about that, probably that way, you know, so it's, it's really, there's an industry of how can I recreate a certain sound? And that's really the biggest problem for guitarists, especially, you know, guitarists. There, there are so many idioms, and I'm saying there are so many idioms. Yes. But it's a limited amount of idioms, and once you get into learning one of them, it's really, really hard to break out of it again. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>And, and I got so lucky. I had the, a really fresh start. I had lessons with Robert Fripp, who was also very much focused on the, on the, on the physics of playing Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I had this instrument that that was not tradition for. And so it was just an ideal field that I could explore and come up with a technique. And, and like I said, you know, the technique is not geared towards playing any, any music in particular. It's, it's just about how can I play a beautiful note and how can I play any order of beautiful notes? That's what, what made me the music musician that I am. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. That's a, that's a really inspiring, inspiring story. So now when you, how do you take that Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And how do you take, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2386.525" data-end_ts="2386.645" title="2386.525" id=c_"2386.525">__I__</span>, so you worked hard and you've worked thoughtfully on developing your own voice. You know, it, it goes way beyond technique. It goes way beyond notes and certainly way beyond the gear, right? Yes. Yes. How do you then, you know, since I've already mentioned, you're, you've done a lot of work as a collaborator with a lot of amazing people. How do you bring that into a collaboration, and how do you know ahead of time if a collaboration is gonna work? Or do you not know ahead of time and you just do it and see what the result is? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>That's a really good question. I mean, obviously I don't know if something's gonna work, but I believe that what we consider to be the making of the music is actually a much, it's much a wider thing that we believe it is. It's not just the fact that you sit down and record together. It's not just the fact that you sit down and write together. It's also the relationship you have with the people that you're doing that with. To me, it's, if I cannot connect with a person, then I'm not gonna collaborate with that person. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But if I, if I'm, if I'm making that connection, then I know that the collaboration is gonna work out. It's like the, the process of making music does not start with actually creating sounds. It starts somewhere else. It starts within you, it starts in the interactions with people. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>It is around us always, you know, so, so what I, I, I guess I developed just <span style="color:red" data-ts="2478.725" data-end_ts="2478.845" title="2478.725" id=c_"2478.725">__a__</span>, an intuition for what works and what doesn't work for me. You know, I sometimes I, I tend to say like, I, I am music. It's, it's not that. It's not that I'm making music. I am music and music itself is kind of, is resonances <span style="color:red" data-ts="2496.405" data-end_ts="2496.605" title="2496.405" id=c_"2496.405">__is__</span> oscillations, and the music is kind of, finding the context that it needs on its own. It's not, I have nothing to, I really don't have to, it's basically effortless to find the people that I can work with. Right. You know, and right now it's, it's, it's really interesting. I'm allowing other people to be part of that process. So I've, I've started working with, Leonardo Kovich of Moon <span style="color:red" data-ts="2525.825" data-end_ts="2526.025" title="2525.825" id=c_"2525.825">__June__</span> Records, and he's, he's a great guy. He, he basically has ideas, for people to, to play together and, and he puts teams together, to record albums. And so last year I met Mark Wingfield, a British guitarist, and it's been wonderful to, to have somebody else suggest collaborations. Right. And it, it just involves trust and also faith in yourself. And Yeah. I'm not, not sure if that really answers your question. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>No, it does. And I mean, this <laugh> intuition is a funny thing because it's a hard thing to describe, but it's an easy thing to feel in your stomach, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>Yes. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2570.065" data-end_ts="2570.355" title="2570.065" id=c_"2570.065">__Yeah__</span>. And 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2571.475" data-end_ts="2571.595" title="2571.475" id=c_"2571.475">__I__</span>, again, I, I think maybe we've all become, or we've all been sort of like taught, or it's been told to us that we have to be very calculated and very, very prescribed in how we approach our musical careers. Be careful and thoughtful, but also Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know, supermarket oriented and all this kind of stuff. And one of the things that I appreciate about this discussion is the sense to which you allow people to come to you. You're not Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know, you're not trying to apply marketing approaches to musicality to drive the way that you do the thing that you do. And I really appreciate that a lot because in a way I'm getting, I'm getting almost immune to people who, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2619.465" data-end_ts="2619.685" title="2619.465" id=c_"2619.465">__to__</span> overtly market themselves as somebody I should listen to. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>Right. You know, and, and I mean, it just, it just also doesn't work anymore. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2629.345" data-end_ts="2629.565" title="2629.345" id=c_"2629.345">__Oh__</span>, it doesn't, it's just something that the music industry, the business was, was creating as an illusion to control artists and the, and the listeners, right. Just to, to be able to, to make money of both the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2642.405" data-end_ts="2642.645" title="2642.405" id=c_"2642.405">__artist__</span> and the listeners <laugh>. It's, it's true.

<b>Darwin: </b>It's true. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2646.925" data-end_ts="2647.165" title="2646.925" id=c_"2646.925">__Yeah__</span>. Absolutely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>And I mean, just coming quickly, coming back to the intuition thing, what, what we tend to forget is that we as, the, like humans as pattern recognition machines, we, we have more available than just the conscious, the things that we understand with our conscious being. There's also the subconscious. And really what I, what I mean when I say intuition is that there's also a way to, to be comfortable with what our subconscious understands, even if our, if, even if it doesn't show up in our conscious, you know what I mean? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. It's just believing that, and, and this is something that, that really, I've, I've gotten, you know, some people laugh about that when I say that, that I know what's right, or, or so I used to say, I know what music is. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, but, but what that means is that I'm starting from a point of saying yes, I'm saying yes to the process from, you know, just drawing energy from my subconscious where I say, okay, my subconscious can deal with this situation, even though I might not be able to follow the chords that this great jazz player is gonna play. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>However my subconscious is <span style="color:red" data-ts="2723.835" data-end_ts="2723.955" title="2723.835" id=c_"2723.835">__going__</span> is much faster than what I think I, you know, and then the what, what the conscious part of me thinks, and I can just allow my subconscious to take over and just play along. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>You know, and, and that's what I mean with intuition. So it's, it is even a technical thing in, in a sense, you know, it's, it's not just the emotions. It's not, it's not just, the stomach. It's also just trusting in, in yourself to be, to be much more than what you think you are. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Well, Marcus, that, that is inspiring. That is, you've got my head full of, of stuff now, <laugh>, and I appreciate that. It's, unfortunately our time is already up, but, I just, just before we go, do you have anything coming up that you would like people to know about in terms of either releases, you're, you're on this tour right now, and, are you, what do you have coming up after that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>Really the, the most important for me is that I've just switched to the subscription model that I, mentioned before. So really what I would like is to have more people know about it and maybe sign up for it. Sure. That's really, that's really my big project. So rather from, rather than looking at individual releases, what I'm doing is I'm looking at building this community and, yeah, you can find it, as, marcus rer.com and then you, you can, you could find it under the music tab. Right. And yeah, I'm planning on, on putting out, a release almost every month there, from the archives. And there's, like <span style="color:red" data-ts="2833.315" data-end_ts="2833.435" title="2833.315" id=c_"2833.315">__I__</span>, I mentioned the collaboration with Moon <span style="color:red" data-ts="2835.195" data-end_ts="2835.395" title="2835.195" id=c_"2835.195">__June__</span> records. There's gonna be a, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2837.515" data-end_ts="2837.635" title="2837.515" id=c_"2837.515">__a__</span> new trio album with Mark Wingfield and a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2840.555" data-end_ts="2840.755" title="2840.555" id=c_"2840.555">__South__</span> Circus called Lighthouse coming out in September. And, you know, there's always new things happening. And I'm currently working on a, on an album of, and actually I'm calling it an album, a suite of string quartets that's gonna be out sometime next year. And so, I hope that people will stay tuned and, and I also hope that at some point I'll, I'll start writing some articles on my website. And yeah, there's also a newsletter option, and so that's really, that's closest to my heart that people kind of join the community. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Well, this sounds really exciting and it sounds like a really thoughtful way to approach kind of speaking to your, to your fans as well. I really like it. And, I appreciate it. Thank you so much for that. And with that, we'll say goodbye. Have a, have a great rest of your day. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Markus: </b>Thank you, Darwin. Bye-Bye bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thank you so much for, listening. Again. I'm sorry this was all late this week. I had a little family excitement to deal with, dealt with. I hope that you enjoyed hearing from Marcus Reuter as much as I did. If you haven't had a chance to check out his site yet, you really need to do it. His subscription motto is really great. If you want to be really into his stuff. He really promises to bring something unique, and I like it as <span style="color:red" data-ts="2924.415" data-end_ts="2924.535" title="2924.415" id=c_"2924.415">__a__</span> interesting way to interact directly with fans. So again, check it out, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2928.295" data-end_ts="2928.575" title="2928.295" id=c_"2928.295">__mark__</span> marcus reuter.com. Beyond that, thank you so much for continuing to listen. Please make sure that you continue to share this with your friends, family. Everyone else, they all need to know about it. They really do. Have a great week. See you next time. Bye.
