<b>Darwin: </b>Welcome to the Art Plus Music Plus Technology podcast. This episode is brought to you by the Csic Society, the Electronic music Ensemble of Jill Frazier and Peter Grenada with their upcoming release on CSR records featuring tool drummer Danny Carey and <span style="color:red" data-ts="25.845" data-end_ts="25.965" title="25.845" id=c_"25.845">__d__</span> Paul Sandra of Coil and UUUU, available soon on iTunes and as a cd@steveroach.com with liner notes on their site@cizxsociety.com. That's <span style="color:red" data-ts="38.885" data-end_ts="41.005" title="38.885" id=c_"38.885">__Z-X-Z-Z-Y-Z-X__</span> society.com. Now enjoy this interview with Nile Steiner. Okay. Today I have the great pleasure of speaking to one of the people who's who I consider, kind of a, a touchstone for all the electronic music work that we do. His name's Nile Steiner. He has had his fingers in a lot of amazing work. Now, rather than try and list them all myself, I'll see if we can make him list them. So with that, I'm gonna say hi to Nile. Hey Nile. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle Steiner: </b>I'm fine. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I really appreciate you taking the time to have this chat. Why don't we start off by having you tell people just kind of the thumbnail version of how you identify yourself. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>I've been known for, designing electronic music, synthesizer type things. And also I worked in the studios in, in LA for about 20 years. Underscoring movies and tv, playing an instrument I call electronic valve instrument. I call it that because I fashioned it with fingering like a trumpet 'cause that's what I used to play. And I've <span style="color:red" data-ts="118.155" data-end_ts="118.445" title="118.155" id=c_"118.155">__been__</span> around 19, late seventies. I finally got it working well enough I could play it professionally. I started in the early seventies, designing it. The first instruments I built were keyboard synthesizers, but I don't play keyboard very well. So I started experimenting around with something that could be played, kind of like a trumpet Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And so I, started making that and, and that finally got to the point where I could start playing it professionally. I went to California in around 1979. I, started working on movie Apocalypse Now, and that worked out pretty well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b><laugh> that was, most of that work was done in San Francisco. But then, afterwards I, moved to Los Angeles area and worked in the studios quite regularly until around year 2000. And so I had about a 20 year span of working before I went to the studios. I had a company building synthesizers. It was called Steiner Steiner Parker. A friend of mine named Parker, designed most of the cabinetry, and I designed the circuits. I see. And we built modular synthesizer. And then we made a compact, one called the Cinon, which now I've, seen sell for close to $10,000, or in the $9,000 range on eBay. They sold for a lot less than that <laugh> when we made him. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The person who got us in contact was Peter Grenada. And he, and he said to me that one of the things that I should ask you about is your first modular that, you had done with, Vladimir <span style="color:red" data-ts="225.155" data-end_ts="225.445" title="225.155" id=c_"225.155">__Yuki__</span>, at the University of Utah. Is that, is that accurate? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>Yeah, it is. I was starting to experiment with synthesizers on my own a little while before that. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="236.945" data-end_ts="237.165" title="236.945" id=c_"236.945">__us__</span> just came to the University of Utah as a composer in residence and electronic music professor. He started a studio there. And there wasn't anybody else I knew in the area that was interested in electronic music. So I was quite intrigued by the fact that this professor was teaching electronic music at the University of Utah. And, at the time, I wasn't enrolled, but I, I asked him, I approached him and said, can I come and audit your electronic music class? He was giving a musicology class on electronic music composers and things like that. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. He said, sure, you can come and sit in. So I just came and sat in, on his classes. And then I got to know him and showed him what I was building as synthesizer. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>And he, became quite interested and says, why don't you build one for the university? Would you be willing to build a, a modular synthesizer for the University of Utah? And so I, I started doing that, and that was the first modular synthesizer that I had built for anybody else other than myself. And I was still experimenting at the time, designing circuits. So I, designing circuits and building for the University of Utah, kind of at the same time. 'cause I started building theirs before. I had a whole lot done on my own system. My own system was kind of small. And so I kind of built my own system and theirs at the same time. They, they grew together. I see. And then after that, a friend named Parker, he's also worked, we were working together in a company in electronic engineering department. He, he said, let's, start making some of these. So, and he was very good at doing woodwork as well as had knowledge of electronics. And he said he, designed the, the cabinets and, <span style="color:red" data-ts="367.565" data-end_ts="367.685" title="367.565" id=c_"367.565">__designed__</span> the, the hardware. And you designed the, the modules. 'cause I was into electronic music at that time and had quite an interest in designing electronic music modules and devices. And so we started making synthesizers in his basement at that time. That was around 1975. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And these were full on modular systems? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>Yeah, yeah. We started making modular systems that you patch with patch cords. And then later we decided to make one that was more compact, where you didn't have to use patch cords, but it had a lot of switches that you could route the, the signals. And had quite a number of switches along the bottom of a row of where it had a bunch of knobs above these switches. And we called that the cinon. And that was like a, a fork of keyboard with a thin panel on the top along thin panel. And it did similar things to the, similar things to what the modular synthesizer would do. I think at the time, I don't know, it was one of the more popular synthesizers. We were just, you know, making our own. But now they've become quite popular on eBay. They sell for quite a bit. And I think we sold 'em for around $1,400 back then, is what we were selling <span style="color:red" data-ts="453.645" data-end_ts="453.885" title="453.645" id=c_"453.645">__them__</span> for 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Yeah. So that was a syn theon that, it, my understanding is that it had a real peculiar sound. And I think a lot of people sort of focus the, their attention on the filter that was part of that. And I mean, to the point where now the, what's considered a Steiner filter is even a highly sought after sound, just like in modern modular gear as well. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>It seems that that has become the case. And, Arturia has put the Steiner fielder in, in, a number of their products now that they sell. Right, right. Analog synthesizers. And at the time, I was, just interested in making my own filterer that wasn't <span style="color:red" data-ts="505.525" data-end_ts="505.765" title="505.525" id=c_"505.525">__going__</span>, going to infringe on patents, <laugh> of Mogue and Arp and stuff like that. Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="511.525" data-end_ts="511.685" title="511.525" id=c_"511.525">__And__</span> no, nobody ever approached me and says, Hey, you're infringing on a patent. So I guess it was, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You did your job right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>I guess it was had enough uniqueness that nobody seemed to challenge the, the patent aspect of it. I did think about patenting it, but I never did really patent it. It was expensive enough and things going on at the time. It just seemed a little outta reach, affordability. And I think if I had <span style="color:red" data-ts="543.605" data-end_ts="543.765" title="543.605" id=c_"543.605">__have__</span> patented it, it wouldn't have made any difference now anyway. 'cause the patent would be expired. Right, right. But the filler has become much more popular than I ever expected it would. My goal was to make a filter that was very simple in design and was made with discrete components and didn't use any special integrated circuits. 'cause I was quite gun shy of integrated circuits always being available. There were some integrated special integrated circuits that some filter designers used back then. And I didn't wanna, I wanted to be able to build this filter forever in case these integrated circuits became obsolete. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>And indeed, indeed, they have become obsolete. Right, right. They're, they're, you can still get 'em, but they're, they're not manufactured anymore. And so I basically wanted to make a <span style="color:red" data-ts="597.045" data-end_ts="597.205" title="597.045" id=c_"597.045">__field__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="597.205" data-end_ts="597.365" title="597.205" id=c_"597.205">__that__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="597.365" data-end_ts="597.525" title="597.365" id=c_"597.365">__it__</span> had a simple design so it could be built easily and also would use discrete components that would always be available. And, and, and it had to sound good too. And, and I finally came up with a design that seemed to fill those three requirements. I, I liked the sound of it. Everything I designed, the bottom line was, did it sound good? And so I finally came up with a, a design that I thought was simple, easy to build and had a good sound right to me. It, it, it satisfied my desires for us a filter sound. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. So now, what I'm curious about is you dropped some hints. I mean, obviously you are an accomplished musician if you are able to go off and work on music's, movie soundtracks and stuff like that. I mean, there's, there's a level of accomplishment that's required just to be able to do that. But you also have enough, electronic chops to be designing, apparently designing, modular synths just because you wanted to even before you got hired to do it. Which, which came first and which really represents sort of like the passion for you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>Yeah. It's hard to say because, they both were developed simultaneously as fiddled around with electrical things and technical things from a very early age. But I was also grew up in a classical music environment. And I was trained, you know, traditionally I was a trumpet player and my mom was a, a very great keyboard player, with perfect pitch and all that. But she could never get me to practice the piano enough <laugh>, I think, I think her patients finally ran out, <laugh> said, oh, let's have him play the trumpet. You know, so I, I never, my sisters all became good piano players, but, me and my brother just never did quite get with, you know, the schedule practicing required to be a good keyboard player. Right. So, but I was trained musically and in, in college, I, was studying music and I was, studying music performance. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>That was my major, the, the head of the music department. I was riding on a bus with him one time, 'cause he was also a director of the, of the band. And, he was talking to me, he says, you know, you don't need a degree to, perform, but if you're ever gonna teach music, you need a degree for that. So really you ought <span style="color:red" data-ts="765.765" data-end_ts="765.845" title="765.765" id=c_"765.765">__to__</span> change your major to music education rather than music performance. And at the time, it made enough sense. I thought, okay, I'm gonna change my major to, music education. And after doing that for a little while, I, it just dawned on me, like, when I graduate from college, I'm gonna become a music teacher. I'll probably be a high school music teacher or something. And that just, that is just not my personality. I <laugh> I just wouldn't, it didn't sit well, huh? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>Yeah, I just, I thought, you know, I, <span style="color:red" data-ts="796.845" data-end_ts="796.965" title="796.845" id=c_"796.845">__I__</span> can't see myself being a music teacher. Right. I just don't have the personality for it. So I dropped outta college and never did really get a degree. I had about three or more years of accumulated college time, but I just never get, did a get a degree. And also I thought an alternative to this would be to get an engineering degree. I have a lot of abilities in the engineering electronic world, but mathematics was not my high point. And so I, I figured if I'm gonna go into engineering, I'm gonna have to go clear back through dumbbell math. And, that didn't appeal to me. So I <laugh> I left the college and went to work for a electronics company. And it was a really great environment. I learned a lot about electronic design, just rubbing shoulders with all of these engineers. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>And I was a, what you call an engineering technician. I was a person who would assemble circuits and make 'em work. Right. I got good at the practicality of making 'em work, and I understood how they worked. I, I had a real good flare for how electronic circuits worked and gained the ability to, to design them. An electronic circuit simulates a computer. Every electronic circuit you make, simulates a computer in the same way as a computer can simulate an electronic circuit. So I had the ability to do all the mathematical things that needed to be done in design, because you put a circuit in front of yourself, it's acting as a computer. <span style="color:red" data-ts="894.545" data-end_ts="894.765" title="894.545" id=c_"894.545">__You__</span>, it figures out values and, everything that you would use mathematics to, to calculate. And that worked out pretty good. And that was kind of the philosophy that I got into designing circuits and anything I didn't understand about how it, it worked. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>I was around an engineer who could explain it to me. I was pretty good at building electronic circuits before working there, but my skills really grew being in that environment, really understanding circuits. I got hired there because I did have some electronic abilities when I left college. I just, I don't know, I, I liked the college environment, but it just wasn't comfortable in it. And I remember about that time driving down the street looking at a guy selling newspapers on the side of the street. And I looked over and I said, you know, that might be what I'm gonna end up doing, but that's just my personality. If that's what I end up doing, that's the way it's gotta be. You know, the way it's gonna go. Right. But I remember resolving myself. That might be what I end up. Sure. So anyway, I just, I didn't like college enough that I remember thinking that, you know, a lot of <span style="color:red" data-ts="960.845" data-end_ts="960.965" title="960.845" id=c_"960.845">__us__</span> probably immaturity thinking too, you know, but so, but anyway, I was always played around electronic circuits. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>And at that time I went to an agency, an employment agency, and I told the guy, I says, I'd like to work in electronics, you know, and the guy says, well, have you been to an electronic school? And I said, no. He said, well, go to an electronic school and come back when you've, when you've had some experience. I went to a second employment agency and I told the guy, yeah, I do a lot of electronics. I've experimented a lot. I'd like to find a job in electronics. And he said, well, there's a place down there in Salt Lake that you might, we might be able to get you started with. And he connected me with them. And that's how I got started with that company. I went down there and, started working for 'em. And they, they decided, oh yeah, let's, so they, they let me start working. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>And it was a full-time job, but it was in a section where we just made drawings. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1020.465" data-end_ts="1020.685" title="1020.465" id=c_"1020.465">__It__</span> wasn't, assembly drawings. It wasn't really circuit oriented. Right. But, but they had another department, the engineering department where they had what they called, you know, engineering technicians. And I thought, you know, they got an opening there and I decided, gee, I'm gonna try out for that. You know, I'm gonna tell 'em I'm interested. So the people in the electronic department, at first it was the testing department where you test circuits. Right. And they says, well, we'll give you a test. They gave me a test and it turned out really good. They were quite impressed. And, and they, they let me work over there in the, in the testing department. And I gained a lot of feel for, 'cause they had, really good equipment and stuff that I didn't have my hands on. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>I was able to get a feel for it. And after working there a year or two, an opening came up in the engineering technician department. And I told 'em I was interested in that. And they interviewed eight people, from the test department to select somebody. And I was lucky and was selected to be an engineering technician. I showed the, the main engineer, the guy who was in charge <span style="color:red" data-ts="1096.725" data-end_ts="1096.925" title="1096.725" id=c_"1096.725">__of__</span> the engineering department, things I was working on, things I was interested in and had built. And I think he liked what, what I told him. And they hired me as an electronic test technician or electronic, engineering technician. Right. And that's where I really got to play with circuits, the most. And 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, I've actually talked to a few people that have gone through that. And in fact, they said that that environment ended up being an amazing education. Because first of all, you're dealing with having to get, having to find out why a circuit might or might not be working properly. But also you're around these engineers and you're getting to see them at work. And there's something about that kind of being in that kind of milieu that makes you actually engage in the engineering concepts at a deeper level than just studying out of a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1154.245" data-end_ts="1154.405" title="1154.245" id=c_"1154.245">__book__</span> in school. Oh, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>Yeah. That definitely, is the case. I think in a lot of cases when you're, you're learning in the books, they hit you with all of the, the stuff that's non-intuitive and it's hard to relate to the actual thing that's going on. When I was in high school, they had two electronic classes. They had first year, what they call radio one, and the second year was radio two. And the first year we spent actually building radio circuits. We actually <span style="color:red" data-ts="1185.885" data-end_ts="1186.125" title="1185.885" id=c_"1185.885">__built__</span> them and made 'em run, made 'em work. And the second year was more of the theory kind of stuff. We were studying the theory of these circuits that worked really good because we all got our hands on these, circuits and radio circuits and building 'em and getting a feel for 'em. And just about everybody in the class would, would build their own radio and make it work. And then the second year, so we really had a feel for it and an interest in it, and, knew that we could build something <span style="color:red" data-ts="1215.245" data-end_ts="1215.325" title="1215.245" id=c_"1215.245">__to__</span> work. And the second year we learned more of the theory of why it 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Was going on. Right. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>Yeah. Faraday's laws and, and all this stuff, you know. So that, that worked out to be a very good, very good environment. That was really something that influenced me quite a bit. And then after high school, when I got interested in synthesizers and working in electronic music and working at this company where I was immersed with all these engineers and, very, it was very educational. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So what was the thing that got you interested in musical electronics? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>I was, you know, trained music league, mostly in the classical realm. I played trumpet in the Utah Symphony. I was studying trumpet from, the principal trumpet player in the Utah Symphony. And at that time, people were s saying the Utah Symphony was among the top 10 even back then. Sure. And I had the opportunity to play in it. So I had a lot of experience in high school and college. I played in the, the symphony orchestra that they had there, and also concert band. So I had a lot of experience performing. And sometimes I'd play solos, you know, 'cause my mother could accompany anything I wanted to play. So it was easy to go and perform like a trumpet solo at different places, different occasions. Sure. So, I played trumpet solos and I played in the orchestra and the band. So I had a lot of experience, playing music, reading music and, you know, just performing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>And also, my mom and dad, they both sang in the Tabernacle Choir. So they got free Utah Symphony tickets, which were, at that time they performed in the Tabernacle. So I was able to go to almost every Utah Symphony concert for several years with free tickets. Oh, right. My parents usually wouldn't have time to go. And, and so, I'd always get one of the free tickets. And so I went to a lot of Utah Symphony concerts. So I not only was studying music then, but I actually was able to go listen to it, perform. Sure. So, so <span style="color:red" data-ts="1344.885" data-end_ts="1345.205" title="1344.885" id=c_"1344.885">__there__</span> was a good musical environment, but I also liked playing around with electronics and chemistry and different things. And I had kind of read about electronic music in some books. It wasn't anybody in the area who was, that I really knew of. It was into electronic music, but it just kind of fascinated me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>So I just kind of experimented around with circuits that would, could produce sound, and made some really crude, things that were, that made electronic sounds. One of the first things I made was a, an electronic thein. And, played around with that. And then <span style="color:red" data-ts="1383.565" data-end_ts="1383.765" title="1383.565" id=c_"1383.565">__that__</span>, that just kind of grew. Or a person loaned me a little device that you played the trumpet through a microphone and it would divide the, the sound into lower octaves. Okay. And I was fascinated by that <laugh> put that into an amplifier. So one of the first things I ever built was, kind of like that frequency divider. At the time. I couldn't afford to buy one, so I decided to build my own. So I, I made a thing that was, divides by octaves. And so that was one of the first modules I ever built, was something that would take a sound and play it one and two octaves lower. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>Interesting. And then I expanded on that. One of the modules in, in my modular system is called A Frequency Divider. And that's how it got started. I think I'm unusual in that I have some facility in electronics and in in music I've met few, if any people that understand electronics and music to the degree that I might be conversing with. You know, like most musicians I know, especially the really good ones, are not into electronics. So they would not, you wouldn't expect them to build their own electronic modules. And most of the engineers that I know do not play professionally. There. There are some that do, but they, they would not, you wouldn't expect them to be symphony members or something like that. Right, right. Even though they, they might be good at music. So there's very few people who, who you might say have done professional music and professional electronics at the same time. So there's a, there's a compromise there. I'm not the greatest musician around, and I'm not the greatest electronic engineer around, but I do both kind of thing. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, but it also being ha being in that position though, also puts you in an interesting spot, because especially I, I'll tell you, my introduction to you actually was as an EVI player. I mean, way back in the day, I remember seeing pictures of you playing the EVI and, listening to that music and, you know, all the way back to the Apocalypse Now soundtrack. But you know, even throughout some of the studio work you did and some of the other stuff you did, and it, it was such a defined sound to, in a way, you <span style="color:red" data-ts="1530.125" data-end_ts="1530.325" title="1530.125" id=c_"1530.125">__ca__</span> you became the very best person at your instrument because you designed your own instrument. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>Yeah. I think that's a lot of it. I designed the, you know, I always design the instrument for my own liking, and then if somebody else likes it, that's fine, <laugh>. But, but the priority is <span style="color:red" data-ts="1551.285" data-end_ts="1551.525" title="1551.285" id=c_"1551.285">__that__</span> if I, if I think it feels good, then I'm, I'm happy with it. Right. And, generally that transfers over. Other people liked it also. So yeah, I, I think that that was my, criteria Sure. Was that it's gotta feel good. I got, I need to be able to play with it. I need to be able to do what I want with it. It took to make it <span style="color:red" data-ts="1576.725" data-end_ts="1576.845" title="1576.725" id=c_"1576.725">__slide__</span> a number of years to, to make it work. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, what was the, what was the process like of coming up with the EVI? Because it seems like a pretty complicated thing, really. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>Well, in a way it's quite simple. I mean, if you compare it to a, if you compare it to a hard drive that goes in your computer that you can buy for $60 <laugh>, it is very, very, very simple in comparison. You know, the, the degree of technology that goes into it making synthesizers, I naturally did it with a keyboard to start with. A keyboard is one of the most natural things to build a synthesizer. 'cause it's very simple. You push a key down and you can close a switch and you can define a pitch, you know, and how fast you hit the key can also be since, but, so a keyboard is a natural thing to make a wind instrument is a little more complicated. And I figured, well, I'm not a very good keyboard player, even though I was doing a lot of electronic music in my, in a little studio I built in my basement for modern dance people. And, I was using keyboard because, that's all the way, way ahead to play the synthesizer. Right. It 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Was the easy way to do it. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>Yeah. And sometimes I'd play my trumpet through that divider thing. And so I had a couple of ways of doing it, but, I finally got thinking, well, I wonder if it's possible to make something that fingers like a trumpet. You know, I don't know if it'd ever be practical, but it's worth experimenting. So I experimented with it. And of course, trumpet, you, you play with your amateur being changed, you know, to get up and down the, the harmonics. I just couldn't find a practical way to do that. You know, it just, there are certain things that you can simulate that you can approach, but you can't perfect them. And that's one of 'em. Right. So I decided I'm gonna make something where the left hand does those overtones rather than try to do it with my arm. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1707.805" data-end_ts="1708.125" title="1707.805" id=c_"1707.805">__Amateur__</span>. I see. That turned out to be a much more practical thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So <span style="color:red" data-ts="1712.805" data-end_ts="1713.045" title="1712.805" id=c_"1712.805">__they__</span> a compromise between what's practical and how different is it than the actual instrument. So I made the EVI learning a left hand technique to handle the harmonics overtones rather than actually playing 'em with the Asure. And that, that, was a situation that required quite a change in playing technique, but it was a change that was doable. And to this day, that's the, the philosophy of the EVI. So, EVI is not as marketable as say, a keyboard synthesizer, because trumpet players can't just go into a store and try it out. Oh yeah. I like the way this feels. It, it takes some commitment and time to do it. It's kinda like a clarinet player learning a bassoon, let's say. So it wasn't as easy to to market. But then after, I started working in the studios, some of the woodwind players down there, I thought, boy, he's, he's doing pretty well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>He's getting a good gig. I always felt like it was miraculous actually, that I did as well as I did. But it was something, you know, I still look back. It was a miracle that I got into playing there like I did, but Right. And was, is hard to explain. But, anyway, some, some of the woodwind players approached me and they say, could you make a thing like that that's like for woodwind players? And I said, well, why should I do that? There's the, the lyric <span style="color:red" data-ts="1802.045" data-end_ts="1802.245" title="1802.045" id=c_"1802.045">__on__</span>, you know, why I don't, I don't need to bother making a woodwind one. 'cause you there's a lyric <span style="color:red" data-ts="1808.965" data-end_ts="1809.125" title="1808.965" id=c_"1808.965">__on__</span>. Just play that. And they said, well, we've tried the lyric <span style="color:red" data-ts="1811.765" data-end_ts="1811.885" title="1811.765" id=c_"1811.765">__on__</span> and we like yours better. Maybe the sound or something. Right. The sound. They said, yeah, we know about the lyric <span style="color:red" data-ts="1816.485" data-end_ts="1816.605" title="1816.485" id=c_"1816.485">__on__</span>, but we like your instrument better. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>So they convinced me to, make a form of woodwind, which is, I call the electronic woodwind instrument. EWI. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And so I started making prototypes and selling 'em to woodwind players down there. And it actually got the point after, a while that there were woodwind players playing similar stuff that I did, enough that I was actually sort of competing with them actually in the studios <laugh>. Right. And it finally got to the point where composers would, well, let's see. Do we have an EEWI player available? Or is there an EVI player available? There's several EVI players down there too that I built them for Uhhuh <affirmative>. And, and when, when they did the music copying, they <span style="color:red" data-ts="1873.685" data-end_ts="1873.885" title="1873.685" id=c_"1873.685">__had__</span>, you know, they have a stamp that says obo, a rubber stamp <span style="color:red" data-ts="1878.145" data-end_ts="1878.365" title="1878.145" id=c_"1878.145">__at__</span> the top of the page says OBO trumpet, you know, well, they, they made a stamp called EWI <laugh> and it, and it became, one in the same, if I worked for somebody, the music might say EWI at the top. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>So if a EWI player could come, they would, play an EWI if <span style="color:red" data-ts="1899.605" data-end_ts="1899.685" title="1899.605" id=c_"1899.605">__an__</span> EVI player came. They played EWI part on EVI. It became kind of known as the same instrument as far as copyists were concerned. Ah, I see. Okay. So, so all the music was, so it finally gotta the point where they say, oh, we've got an iwi player coming in. You know. And so finally I decided, oh, let's call that electronic wind instrument instead of electronic woodwind instrument. So you could think of A EVI as an EWI, it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1925.845" data-end_ts="1925.965" title="1925.845" id=c_"1925.845">__an__</span> electronic wind instrument. They're all in the same category. And, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1930.945" data-end_ts="1931.165" title="1930.945" id=c_"1930.945">__So__</span> now both of those, both of those devices originally had like a synthesizer connection, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>Yeah. In the, in the original, in the early days, I built the sound modules to go with the instrument. Right. And then when <span style="color:red" data-ts="1946.405" data-end_ts="1946.685" title="1946.405" id=c_"1946.405">__many__</span> came along, I, interfaced these things to synthesizers. Got it. External synthesizers. Okay. So when <span style="color:red" data-ts="1954.875" data-end_ts="1955.165" title="1954.875" id=c_"1954.875">__MIDI__</span> came along, we, I was able to translate that into <span style="color:red" data-ts="1959.045" data-end_ts="1959.165" title="1959.045" id=c_"1959.045">__a__</span>, a MIDI interface. There was a, a guy in, California named Jim Cooper Yeah. Who, who had designed a MIDI interface for the lyric <span style="color:red" data-ts="1969.565" data-end_ts="1969.765" title="1969.565" id=c_"1969.565">__on__</span>. And I approached him and had him tailor make some that would work for the EEVI. And so it was, called the Jim Cooper interface, but there was changes I needed made. And it was too hard to get him to make the changes. He was busy doing other projects. And I needed things that were, I needed changes and, modifications in this MIDI interface, which was a microprocessor. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>Right. So it was frustrating. I couldn't get him to do the changes I needed up to that point. I was an analog circuit designer. I didn't know hardly anything about microprocessors. I just decided one day I've got to learn about microprocessors or get left behind. It's, it's just that simple. So I wasn't able to get source code or anything from him. So I took what's called a double E prom that had the, the program on it. And I sat down one day and I decided if the microprocessor can go through all of this code and decode it in 10 milliseconds, <laugh>, so can you <laugh> I ought to be able to do it in six months <laugh>. So that, so that's what I did. I, I was able to take the machine code out of the chip and write it down on paper. And I started looking up what each command was. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>And it took me many months Right. To finally figure out what that code was doing. But by the time I did that, I was able to, make changes of my own. It was a Z 80 microprocessor. Sure. And so every time I needed something different, I was actually started writing the code in machine language. It was very laborious. And, 'cause I, at the time, I didn't know how to use an assembler. And finally after several years of doing that, I finally learned how to use an assembler write, assemble language so I could write this code more efficiently. And so the original MIDI interface grew and grew and grew. And, and pretty soon that interface thing that I was, programming became basically the whole system. Right. That controlled the synthesizer. So it was like, like taking <span style="color:red" data-ts="2105.565" data-end_ts="2105.685" title="2105.565" id=c_"2105.565">__a__</span>, the back of a truck and finally turning it into a, a big house size-wise and everything, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2111.885" data-end_ts="2112.085" title="2111.885" id=c_"2111.885">__the__</span> microprocessor size of memory kept getting bigger. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>And I finally, started writing with assembly language and, and finally, finally grew into my own system. But it all started with, Jim Cooper's interface. Interface. Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2127.985" data-end_ts="2128.205" title="2127.985" id=c_"2127.985">__And__</span> the fact that he couldn't give me the, the source code <laugh> really was a, a blessing. It was a turning point for you. Yeah. Yeah. It was, it was, because up to that point, I really didn't even know why they had microprocessors. I just thought they used them so they could run a bunch of fancy lights, you know? Right. This one guy one made an interface, a thing that was called a, a Moog synthesizer that was digitally controlled with a microprocessor. And I remember looking inside of that, I had to look inside so I could figure out how to interface the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2161.165" data-end_ts="2161.285" title="2161.165" id=c_"2161.165">__a__</span> VI to it. Right. 'cause a friend of mine had bought one of those. And, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So like the Moog source or something like that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>Yeah. That might be what it was. It was the, it was a source and it had a, a knob that would control all the parameters. You push a button <span style="color:red" data-ts="2177.225" data-end_ts="2177.445" title="2177.225" id=c_"2177.225">__in__</span> which parameter you wanted to. I think that's, that's what it was. It was a source. And I, I was looking through that. I was pretty good at looking inside synthesizers in those days. They were simple enough, you could actually look inside and see what they were doing, you know? Right. Right. I never, I never <span style="color:red" data-ts="2193.965" data-end_ts="2194.205" title="2193.965" id=c_"2193.965">__like__</span> to copy people, but I like to see how people approach things, see 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>How they solved their puzzles. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>Yeah. And I remember one day I decided, I'm gonna see how they make their, how's their envelope generator work? I can see the filterer here. I can see the osci. How are they making the envelope generator? And I tried to find the envelope generator shortcut, and I couldn't find it. And I finally realized, my goodness, the microprocessor is acting as the envelope generator 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Ate that up. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>And that's when I realized that, oh gee, a lot of these things they can simulate with the microprocessor. And it kind of was an eye-opener that that's why they use microprocessors. They can simulate all of these devices Right. In the code. Right. And so that, that was a, a learning experience for me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So this work that you were doing, with the EVI and the EWI were, was that under the Steiner Parker lab? Or had you spun off on your own at that point? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>Yeah, I had spun off on my own. Before I went to California, I had some partnership problems, not with Parker, but with a third partner that we had. I see. Had some severe partnership problems. And, the company was dissolved and 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>And all that stuff. So, so that ended. I see. But there were enough Steiner Parker things floating around that that's how the, you know, people approached it and remembered it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. And then at some point, you took the EVI and EWI and, and started working with a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2282.385" data-end_ts="2282.605" title="2282.385" id=c_"2282.385">__kai__</span> on that. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>Yeah. Yeah. It was interesting how that came about. There's a FA friend of mine who I had built an EWI, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2290.765" data-end_ts="2290.965" title="2290.765" id=c_"2290.765">__or__</span> one of the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2291.365" data-end_ts="2291.525" title="2291.365" id=c_"2291.365">__people__</span>, first people that I'd built an EWI <span style="color:red" data-ts="2293.725" data-end_ts="2293.925" title="2293.725" id=c_"2293.725">__for__</span>, his name was Joel Peskin. And he had a friend named Andy <span style="color:red" data-ts="2298.155" data-end_ts="2298.445" title="2298.155" id=c_"2298.155">__Muon__</span>. And they approached me one day and says, gee, we had a tried to sell these things. And, those two guys had another friend, his name was Matthews, who kind of had some associations with a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2314.485" data-end_ts="2314.685" title="2314.485" id=c_"2314.485">__Kai__</span>. And they got talking to him. And, and, they were thinking, gee, you know, let's, a kai might be interested in this. And so, Joel and Andy approached me and said, they're having a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2326.405" data-end_ts="2326.685" title="2326.405" id=c_"2326.405">__NAMM__</span> show.

Right. I told 'em, I says, you know, I've had a lot of people talk like they want to build it <laugh>, I'm not willing to invest the money to fly all the way back to Chicago and show up to 'em. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>'cause, things like that, usually, you know, people always talk like, oh yeah, let's build that. You know, nothing ever comes <span style="color:red" data-ts="2349.165" data-end_ts="2349.325" title="2349.165" id=c_"2349.165">__of__</span> it. And I said, if you and Andy want to fly back there on your own and show it to 'em, if they happen to go for it, I'll split it with you. I'll split the, the royalties with you. And they decided, okay, we'll do that. So they flew back to the NAMM <span style="color:red" data-ts="2363.405" data-end_ts="2363.605" title="2363.405" id=c_"2363.405">__show__</span> and, approached <span style="color:red" data-ts="2365.205" data-end_ts="2365.325" title="2365.205" id=c_"2365.205">__a__</span> Kai.

But 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Did they ever produce an EVII mean, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2374.285" data-end_ts="2374.525" title="2374.285" id=c_"2374.285">__they__</span>, the ewi Yeah, they did. Is still for a long, is still, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>Something they did in the beginning run. They did make some ebis. Okay. But it was understood at that time that we're, we're gonna do it limited, because they do appear harder to, to market. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But we're going to make 'em. And, they did make a run of them. And there's still people playing those. Yeah. Now, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, I have good friends who, for whom that's still their primary interface with electronic music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>Yeah. So it's, I have an interesting story. A guy named Bruce Cassidy. He was a trumpet player with blood, sweat, and tears. He bought an EVI, you know, the first day he had it, it was, experimental for him, but he figured out some things he could do. And I, I understand that he actually got up on stage the first day he had it and did some things with it <laugh>. But, but I'm sure it wasn't what he does now on it, you know, he still plays it. One time, I think this might have been before we moved to California, blood Sweat and tears came to, salt Lake area up in Park City. They gave a concert, a Bruce Cassie said, come on up and see the concert, and then, come backstage and we'll visit. So I went up to the concert, and this was quite a while later, he played a pretty impressive solo on EVI on that concert, but this was after he'd gotten good at it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>You know, I went to see him backstage and the intermission and the guard says, oh no, you can't, nobody can see him back there. We're not gonna let you in. And I told him, I said, well, go back and tell Bruce Cassidy that, Nile signer's here to visit him. So anyway, the guard did that, or the security guy. And so Bruce come out and said, oh, yeah, come on in. You know, he's, he's fine. We went back there and talked to Bruce. And while we were talking to him, Clayton Thomas, the, the main guy in Blood, sweat and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2493.205" data-end_ts="2493.325" title="2493.205" id=c_"2493.205">__Tears__</span>, he came up and talked to us, and Bruce introduced, introduced us to him and said, this is Clayton Thomas. And, and Bruce said, this is the guy that invented the my EVI. And as soon as Bruce said that, the guy, he jokingly came over and put his hands around my neck and <laugh> like he was trying to strangle me. He says, do you realize how many times, how many hours we had to listen to this guy practicing that thing on the bus <laugh>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2523.795" data-end_ts="2524.085" title="2523.795" id=c_"2523.795">__they__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2524.085" data-end_ts="2524.165" title="2524.085" id=c_"2524.085">__were__</span> traveling around on a bus, you know? Oh, that's hilarious. But now he's finally gotten good at it, you know, <laugh>. So Bruce must have spent a lot of hours on the bus while they were traveling, practicing that thing, and to get good at, and they, they were hearing that, you know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I imagine it had to be pretty difficult for, for trumpet players to go from Asure to like a hand movement, that that had to be a real switch in their head to be able to make that, make that 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>Change. Yeah. It is. Some people do it easier than others. Some people, just it's not their thing. And other people, Hey, I can do that. And it, it actually makes the instrument easier to play, really. It, it's much easier to play than a real, a real trumpet is. Sure. Right. You have unlimited range, same range as a piano. High notes are no problem. But if you get the right feel, you can still simulate the strain of high notes, or you can simulate the ease of high notes like a violin might have, you know, so. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Is anyone still producing an EVI, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>I'm redesigning it right now. Oh. With a thing called Arduino. And there are people around the world who are, experimenting with them. So interesting. But I don't think it's ever been fully produced on the scale that EWI has Uhhuh <affirmative>. Right. I think, I think too many companies are, have been too gun shy of it, you know, 'cause of its marketability. But I think if one could sell cheap enough, you know, a lot of people could say, Hey, I'm gonna try that. Right. It would probably become even more popular than it is, but it's still probably in the esoteric realm of, musical instruments. But there's a number of people that, that are making them, or at least experimenting with them. Sure. Interesting. And I'm, I'm in the process right now. I'm just about ready to have some made, with a thing called an Arduino. And it's definitely much simpler right. Than a, than it is <span style="color:red" data-ts="2647.205" data-end_ts="2647.325" title="2647.205" id=c_"2647.205">__a__</span> C <span style="color:red" data-ts="2647.445" data-end_ts="2647.565" title="2647.445" id=c_"2647.445">__80__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>Yeah. The Arduino is much easier to program, much more compact, has much more in it. It has all interface circuit, most of it in there. And then I find that, I've never been interested in playing virtual synthesizers because I've never been interested in carrying a computer around and setting that up every time I play. Right. But now there's one called a Raspberry Pie that I'm using as a sound module, and it's like the size of a bar of soap, and I don't even need to have a monitor or a keyboard to play it. I just turn it on, it boots up, and then, I can play that. So that's why I've been playing for the last several years. Yeah. That's because it's so handy and small. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's an amazing little device. But what are you running on it that's making the sound? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>I'm using, a program. It's, it's, open source. It's called Fluid Synth. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>Okay. But I'm, I'm using a thing called Q synth, which is Fluid synth in A GUI wrapper, a graphical interface. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Ah, I see. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>And so I can program the raspberry using a, a monitor uhhuh and a keyboard that I plug into it, and then I can unplug the monitor and keyboard and just carry the, the raspberry pie around. And one little, USB power supply Right. Will power the EVI and that, and I can perform with that. All I gotta do is plug into an amplifier of some kind and, or even earphones. And it's, it'll run quite a while on a, a battery, you know, five volt battery, USB charger Sure. Type battery. And that's, that's been really good. I really like that. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2748.565" data-end_ts="2748.685" title="2748.565" id=c_"2748.565">__I__</span>, it uses a, a type of sampling format called Sound Font, which was invented by EMU Systems back in the nineties. It's a format I like because it's a format that the samples are there. If you want to take the samples out and use 'em in some other environment, you can 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>All Yeah. It's like a port portable format. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>Yeah. It's a portable format. It's also capable of playing with the filters and, all the controls you need, along with playing the samples. Some of the earlier sound fonts that I played with only played the sound fonts, and I had to go through another virtual filter. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, I see. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>Right. To control 'em. But, but this qsy fluid syn, it's capable of, and it's all built in the sound font parameters, the filtering, and, even the reverb, this qsy has its own reverb that I think it sounds quite good, good enough that I, I use it and feel good about it. So it is been a great thing. It's free software, it's open source, and it plays better than, a lot of the things would, you know, it, it, it plays with a reasonably good smoothness to me. It plays well enough to carry around and perform with it. Right. And so it's, I really enjoyed carrying everything <span style="color:red" data-ts="2831.545" data-end_ts="2831.765" title="2831.545" id=c_"2831.545">__and__</span> just a little bag instead of a whole bunch of 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> flight cases. Right. Yeah. I mean, it's comparing that to when you were like hauling around a modular or even a cinon for that matter. I mean, it's a completely different show. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>Yeah. In, in Los Angeles, even the Iwi players, we didn't have to carry as much stuff as the keyboards, but we still had a cartage company. Right. Professional cartage companies would bring our stuff to the studios. But now I can do almost everything I did with all that heavy equipment. You know, I'd have a rack mount, I'd have, you know, like a standard rock mount full of modules, and then I'd have stuff on a keyboard rack kind of thing. And the cartage people would set it up. They were quite good at it. They had all the cables color coded, and you'd walk in the studio and they'd have all the cables plugged in and everything. And basically a matter of firing it up and hope everything fires up. Okay. Right. So, so it's changed a lot as far as what you have to carry around. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now we've talked, we've talked a lot about the gear, but one of the things we haven't talked much about is the actual music. Now you've done some, electronic music works of your own. Right. I know that you've got a thing out there called Three Movements for Tape, I think, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>Right? Oh, yeah. That was a long time ago. That was way back in, way back in the modular synth days when I had my own studio in my basement. The music back then was more in the realm of the electronic, kind of atonal type of of stuff. I have a lot of background in that kind of, of music atonal and, kind of, sound colors and things like that, that you put together. Right. That title, I believe that's what you're talking about. I didn't do a lot of composing like a person. That's all they do in their life is compose. But I, I did do, a number of electronic things for modern dance, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2954.645" data-end_ts="2955.005" title="2954.645" id=c_"2954.645">__rotary__</span>, Woodbury dance company, people like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And then, when you were doing studio work, you did a lot of like film work, but didn't you, you also did a lot of, just sort of like regular studio gigs, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>Yeah. They were all the standard go in and play with the orchestra type of Yeah, it was, I was like one of the orchestra and a lot of those things I would set up out with the orchestra. I would sit out, next to the woodwind players, usually <laugh> I see. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2985.685" data-end_ts="2985.845" title="2985.685" id=c_"2985.685">__They__</span> would set me next to the woodwind players. Interesting. Even though I might be playing brass parts or, woodwind, they'd have me play a number of things. Did 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You, were you set up with the amplifier? Did you, did you have to set up with amplifier or? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>Yeah, I had, I had an amplifier that would sit by me just so that I could hear myself. And the people around me could hear what I was doing. I also had a earphone that I could hear myself, but with the earphone, the people around me couldn't hear what I was doing. So I'd, I'd set the amplifier level that they could relate to what I was doing, just as though I was in another acoustic instrument. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure, sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>And so I would adjust the amplifier volume separate from what I was sending into the control room. Got it. I was one of the few people, electronic musicians who had a, had their own separate switch to turn their amplifier on and the feed to the, to the booth. Most synth players didn't have the ability to turn their output on and off what was going into the booth. Right. And so the electronic players were always doing stuff that was complicated. So every time there was a break, or every time the composer wanted to rehearse the strings or something, the electronic musicians were all doodling around trying to get their sounds Right. And trying to make sure everything with their feed's not turned off into the control room. Right. Sometimes the control room would say, Hey, can you guys <laugh> just shut up. Yeah. Can you guys shut up for a few minutes? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>We <span style="color:red" data-ts="3077.005" data-end_ts="3077.165" title="3077.005" id=c_"3077.005">__gotta__</span>, or trying to do this. I would turn my amplifier off and my feet off, but I could still hear it through earphones. I was able to doodle around all I wanted, get my sounds and find out, trying to figure out what I'm doing. Then when the time came to do a take, I'd flip that switch on and be able to play. And every once in a while we'd be halfway through a queue and they'd stop and they'd say, Hey, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3100.385" data-end_ts="3100.605" title="3100.385" id=c_"3100.385">__no__</span>, we can't hear you <laugh>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3102.265" data-end_ts="3102.485" title="3102.265" id=c_"3102.265">__You__</span> say, oh, sorry, sorry, I forgot to flip my switch on. You know, so that, that was a hazard. But the overall balance, everything, the advantage of being able to turn my feet off really gave me an advantage to be able to work on my sounds <span style="color:red" data-ts="3117.035" data-end_ts="3117.325" title="3117.035" id=c_"3117.035">__when__</span>, when I had to be silent. Yeah, indeed. But the other musicians didn't have <span style="color:red" data-ts="3121.825" data-end_ts="3122.045" title="3121.825" id=c_"3121.825">__the__</span> ability to build such a thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>Right. Most of them. There was, I think there's a couple that did anyway, that, that worked out very well. There was a percussionist down there who, very bright guy, his name was Larry Bunker. He played everything and he had to run around all the time. You know, he might be playing <span style="color:red" data-ts="3141.765" data-end_ts="3141.965" title="3141.765" id=c_"3141.765">__<inaudible>__</span>, he run over the <span style="color:red" data-ts="3143.085" data-end_ts="3143.285" title="3143.085" id=c_"3143.085">__Tim__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3143.545" data-end_ts="3143.765" title="3143.545" id=c_"3143.545">__and__</span> the next few beats he has to run over and play Glocks <span style="color:red" data-ts="3146.965" data-end_ts="3147.085" title="3146.965" id=c_"3146.965">__Field__</span> or something, or, so he, he designed his own RF transmitter. He would plug the, the click feed into his, into this RF transmitter. And, and then he had a portable earphone fm right. Radio that he would wear. And so he could hear the click feed while he was running all over the place. He sure he <span style="color:red" data-ts="3169.125" data-end_ts="3169.205" title="3169.125" id=c_"3169.125">__was__</span> tied down. He was pretty bright. He, designed a pretty good way of broadcasting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>And other people when they found, you know, got onto the fact he was doing that, he worked a lot. So <laugh>, a lot of the other percussion people would carry around their own FM radio. Right. And when the session <span style="color:red" data-ts="3189.405" data-end_ts="3189.725" title="3189.405" id=c_"3189.405">__started__</span>, they'd say, Hey, Larry, are you broadcasting <span style="color:red" data-ts="3191.945" data-end_ts="3192.165" title="3191.945" id=c_"3191.945">__And__</span> <laugh>? So they, it was all the questions always ask, are you broadcasting? And right. So they'd put their earphones and FM radio on and, and they would listen to the click through that. That's, that's great. I didn't need to do that. 'cause I sat in one place, you know, I was able to, I didn't have to worry about wireless. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So now, you talk about like traveling around and carrying your instrument and, and this raspberry pie with you. What, what kind of playing are you doing now? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>I don't do a lot. I just kind of play just little local things. Every once in a while. Somebody wants me to play at a 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Come sit in or something. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>They, the biggest thing that I play up here, I do very little, but, they have this annual, event up in Midway Utah. And it's, it's actually, it's an outdoor thing where people set up booths and they sell things. And it's bigger than the state fair. The way I haven't been to the state fair for a while, but I, this thing I think has more people packed in this area than the state Fair has, at least from what I'm perceiving. And they also have entertainment there. I play that they have <span style="color:red" data-ts="3268.085" data-end_ts="3268.245" title="3268.085" id=c_"3268.085">__the__</span> stage where they invite people, groups to come in and perform. And sometimes a person wants to make a cd, like a pianist wants to make a CD of them doing solo piano. They might have me add tracks to it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>I see. So I've, I've gotten to where people like to have me listen and to what they're doing. They might record their whole thing and then bring it to me and I'll put tracks in behind it, like string tracks and wind player tracks, things like that. You know, so it kind of sounds somewhat orchestrated. So I've been doing stuff like that. The story that I, when I first started working on Apocalypse, that was my first real professional recording thing. And it was unusual. It was in San Francisco. I have a, interesting story about how I got into that. I worked with this lady that used to work in, used to live in Salt Lake. 'cause her husband worked at the TV studios, but she was a very gifted musician and pianist. We got working together, you know, just kind of experimenting with music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>And then they moved to San Francisco a number of years later. She called me and says, I've gotten involved with these Italian movie guys. They're doing a movie, and you should come down and <laugh> and audition for 'em. It'd be great to get you involved down here. So I thought, okay, that I'll do that. You know, I'll come down there. And I, put a modular system in the car and I sit <span style="color:red" data-ts="3369.785" data-end_ts="3370.005" title="3369.785" id=c_"3369.785">__on__</span> and I, my EVI and I took off down there to San Francisco. And, this Italian guy, I tend to be pretty naive. You know, I'm, that's the trade off of my electronics is that I tend to be naive about who's doing what. The Italian, movie director was Francis <span style="color:red" data-ts="3393.085" data-end_ts="3393.365" title="3393.085" id=c_"3393.085">__Koola__</span>. And he, he was doing Apocalypse Now. David Robinson, who was, I think Herbie Hancocks producer was kind of in charge of the <span style="color:red" data-ts="3402.325" data-end_ts="3402.525" title="3402.325" id=c_"3402.325">__mo__</span> music for Apocalypse Now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>Right. And she finagled him to, have a meeting with me. You know, I'll drive down there and he'll meet me and I'll go in and talk to him. In the meanwhile, I had a little EVI that was slightly smaller than a shoebox, and I had a two inch speaker in it, which was very low quality, but you could at least practice with it. So I could just open the shoebox, play a very simple synthesizer and, and practice. And I decided to carry that with me the day I met Dave Rubinson. So anyway, I went into his office and he said, well, I appreciate you coming, but we just don't have any time to audition <span style="color:red" data-ts="3447.245" data-end_ts="3447.445" title="3447.245" id=c_"3447.245">__you__</span>. We don't have, you know, we've got everything we need here, but I appreciate you coming. And so I thought, okay, well it doesn't hurt to, to try to get in on these things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>You know, you won't get anywhere if you don't try. Right. And I called my wife and said, well, I'm not gonna be, doesn't look like I'm gonna be doing the movie, but I'm glad I came down. And if you go back about an hour before that, before I went into his office, I had my EVI there carrying that little box. And we weren't even supposed to bring anything. We just were meeting people. And, some people in the studio said, what's that box you're carrying? And, and I said, oh, it's an instrument. And so I, I said, well get it out and play it. So I plugged, I patched into their big speakers and everything and started playing and everybody's really impressed that was there. The, there <span style="color:red" data-ts="3498.485" data-end_ts="3498.605" title="3498.485" id=c_"3498.485">__were__</span> some technicians there and some people there. Sure. They were really impressed when I plugged it into the, into the, their speakers. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>And then after, that's when I went in to see Dave Rubinson and he said, well, we're sorry. We don't have any <laugh>, you know, we're just <span style="color:red" data-ts="3515.565" data-end_ts="3515.725" title="3515.565" id=c_"3515.565">__not__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3515.725" data-end_ts="3515.925" title="3515.725" id=c_"3515.725">__gonna__</span> be able to do this. So anyway, after that, I called, my wife said, it doesn't look like I'm gonna be working on the movie, but David Rubinson was there and he said, since you're here, if you wanna watch the movie, we're gonna, we're gonna run the movie on the screen here. I'm finished. You know, it hadn't even been scored yet, but it was, it's unfinished. You're welcome to stay and watch if you'd like. And I thought, sure, I'll, I'll do that. And so they had a small theater there, and I sat down in one of the seats there, and I sat that shoe box size EVI, down <span style="color:red" data-ts="3548.425" data-end_ts="3548.645" title="3548.425" id=c_"3548.425">__at__</span> the side of my side of my chair and was watching the movie. They had a temp score, a temporary score that they were doing, and they came to a break in the movie to switch reels or something. And so we were sitting there, all the lights on and, halfway through the movie, and Francis Coppola pokes his head in the door, and he happens to look, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3572.905" data-end_ts="3573.125" title="3572.905" id=c_"3572.905">__is__</span> he happens to see my little box sitting down by my chair. And he points to that and he said, is that that thing I've been hearing about all afternoon <laugh>? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>And he says, I gotta see that. So I got it out right there, played it for in front of him with the two inch speaker. Uhhuh <affirmative> showed him what I could do with it, and he said, we gotta have that in the movie. So after the screening was over, David Rubinson approached me and says, we've got you scheduled to start in the studio Monday morning, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, what a story. That's amazing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>So if I hadn't have carried that with me, I think things would've been different. My whole career would've been different, I think. But I just decided this thing is small enough. I'm not supposed to take anything. We're just gonna be meeting people today, but this is small enough, I can carry it and it won't be, you know, it won't be obnoxious or anything. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3626.005" data-end_ts="3626.205" title="3626.005" id=c_"3626.005">__Right__</span>, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What, what an awesome way to make it happen, though. That's really great. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>Yeah. Yeah. I've always felt like if there's any opportunity to that's gonna make you visible or something, take it, you know, and that was one of those opportunities. And when I mentioned, I went into the studio before, before I met Dave Robinson, when I walked in, there was a guy from local music store advertising a Yamaha CS 80. Right. I think that's, and he was showing all these things he could do on that. And I remember thinking he was showing vibrato and stuff. I was thinking, man, I can do that really well on here, <laugh>. So after he got done, I plugged in and, and he was quite impressed. And the guy that was, demonstrating the MOCS 80, he was hoping to sell one to the studio there. He was impressed with what I was doing, and we became good friends and he invited me over to functions at the music store when they were giving demonstrations for instruments. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>He had me come over and we'd play together on these music demonstrations given at the, the store. The store was called St. Regis and Berger. So it worked out with them too. It was like, I got to play with those guys a couple of times. It was a lot of fun doing that. That's awesome. But <span style="color:red" data-ts="3712.205" data-end_ts="3712.365" title="3712.205" id=c_"3712.205">__the__</span> apocalypse was, was my main star. That was the first real professional thing that I had done. And that was about the time the instrument had become developed enough that I could play it professionally. Right. You know, and play it in a professional manner. One of the things that influenced me when I was designing this instrument was, years earlier. The first one just was a switch. You, you blow on some note plays, like pushing a key Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, it didn't have <span style="color:red" data-ts="3740.445" data-end_ts="3740.565" title="3740.445" id=c_"3740.445">__a__</span> breath expression and all those things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>It was kind of like, well, if I figure that out, that'll come later. And I was thinking, what is this instrument really meant to do? Is it meant to be electronic and go through <span style="color:red" data-ts="3752.445" data-end_ts="3752.805" title="3752.445" id=c_"3752.445">__effects__</span> pedals? Maybe that's what I should be doing. Concentrate on effects because it's, more straightforward. You run your thing through <span style="color:red" data-ts="3762.325" data-end_ts="3762.485" title="3762.325" id=c_"3762.325">__there__</span> and you, and you use expression pedals and stuff like that. Right. Or should I go the hard route and make a breath transducer that works, proportional to breath pressure and human vibrato. And one night at a Christmas party, my, my brother was playing violin solo, and it really became clear at that time, that's the direction I need to go. I'd be able, I need to be able to play, like my brother can play that violin Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3790.635" data-end_ts="3790.925" title="3790.635" id=c_"3790.635">__With__</span> human expression. So that was the route I went. You go that direction, you can still go through effects pedals. So <laugh>. But anyway, I'd heard my brother play many times, but at that one time when I listened to him play that violin solo, it was like, it's clear that's the direction I need to go with this. I need to make it humanly expression. And so I went that direction, developed breath control and, and, human <span style="color:red" data-ts="3821.145" data-end_ts="3821.365" title="3821.145" id=c_"3821.145">__by__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3821.365" data-end_ts="3821.565" title="3821.365" id=c_"3821.365">__brought__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3821.565" data-end_ts="3821.765" title="3821.565" id=c_"3821.565">__on__</span> things like that as well as the sound modules. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. But that's probably why it also got, why music while, why really well <span style="color:red" data-ts="3831.005" data-end_ts="3831.325" title="3831.005" id=c_"3831.005">__trained__</span> musicians gravitated towards because <span style="color:red" data-ts="3833.365" data-end_ts="3833.605" title="3833.365" id=c_"3833.365">__they__</span> Yeah. It felt like a real instrument then, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nyle: </b>Yeah. That's exactly the case. Because even today, when I play for older people, they instantly like it, you know? And people who have gotten my age, you know, I'm <span style="color:red" data-ts="3852.165" data-end_ts="3852.245" title="3852.165" id=c_"3852.165">__in__</span>, I'm among that group now, <laugh>, people who've gotten, who are elderly people have had plenty of time to figure out what they like and what they don't like. Right. You know, they listen to music all their lives. They, they know what they like. And whenever I play for a group of older people, they like it instantly. They come up afterwards say, that sounded so good. Which means, which is a good sign because people, you don't have to acquire a taste for the sound. It's, it's a sound that you can like right away. And of course, young people like it also. The fact that people can like it right off the bat is a, is a good sign that it's not something you have to get used to to like. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Indeed. Well, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3902.045" data-end_ts="3902.245" title="3902.045" id=c_"3902.045">__now__</span> I want to thank you so much for taking the time.

<b>Nyle: </b>Okay, bye.

<b>Darwin: </b>So obviously I'm traveling right now, so I hope you don't mind a little odd, sound here as I use a headset at the airport. But, gotta do what we gotta do. I want to thank again, this EC society for supporting and helping make this podcast possible. I also want to thank you, the listeners for continuing to stick with me, for helping build the numbers and for giving me the thumbs up wherever you do. One of the things I would ask is if you have a chance, check out what we're doing on either Spotify or YouTube. We've got feeds going there now, and just having a couple of views or a couple of subscriptions would probably help our efforts there as well. Beyond that, I'm going to let you go. We'll catch you next week. Bye.
