<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. This week, we are going to be talking to a good friend, kind of a mentor to me, person who I always inter enjoy interacting with. His name is Tim Weaver. He is one of the professors at the University of Denver, which is where I got my graduate degree and also where I teach right now. He's hugely in influential in getting me, into that academic world for which I'm very grateful. But also he's a person that kind of very subtly and without being a dick about it actually pushes, pushes me, all the time. So, his very, presence here is kind of a, a push into something. I mean, we've already been talking just about random stuff and I got a head full of ideas, so that's always good. But Tim, how you doing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy Weaver: </b>Great, great being up here in the tree house with you in the canyon. So yeah, this is 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The first, this is actually the first interview I'm doing here at the house. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>Yeah. And it's, and, and I have to say that, you know, having a colleague within walking or biking distance is a unique thing up here in, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="84.82" data-end_ts="85.04" title="84.82" id=c_"84.82">__it__</span>, it's great. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, cool. Thanks a lot for coming up. I appreciate it. So, sounds to me like you've actually been listening to the podcast. So, you know, some of the way that this goes, one of the things I like to do is kind of explore people's background because I, I'm constantly amazed in the whole media art world by, how different everyone's background is and how we all kind of end up in the same place from very different routes. I do know a little bit about your background and your route to media art is one of the most interesting. So why don't you tell us a little bit about that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>Yeah, so, so, one of the, one of the, the kind of landing points that we usually talk about, especially at, well now, at, at du and emergent digital practices, but in the last iteration is digital media studies, is that somehow it ended up being the island of misfit toys, which is fantastic, you know, for, for a lot of, but in terms of, multidisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity, it's, you know, what we're bringing to the, the convergence is, astounding right now because of the ubiquity of, of the media we're working in and, and the influences are important. So, so, but yeah, my path is surreptitious, but now I can make, there's a rationality to it, of course, cuz I, I guess, you know, so, but, and I'll try to lay that out. But, but I, my professional path has come, through, biological sciences in, I studied microbiology at, at Purdue University, and then worked in labs early on back in, you know, in the dark era, the dark ages of, in, in my, in molecular <span style="color:red" data-ts="195.42" data-end_ts="195.74" title="195.42" id=c_"195.42">__biology__</span>, but also in pherom monology studying chemical communication between different species and, early on. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>And then I ended up doing a, graduate degree in environmental and, biochemical engineering at Purdue. And then ended up on the East coast and on the south Coast. And then finally here in the, in, in Boulder, during the genetic engineering kind of uprising, and ended up doing protein engineering and bio biochemical engineering in with environmental emphasis here in Boulder. And, what I was really lucky with is I ran into, I mean, there's a lot of different ways to put it politely and not, but <span style="color:red" data-ts="235.2" data-end_ts="235.42" title="235.2" id=c_"235.2">__the__</span>, the an obstruction in my path where I was like, what am I gonna do? Like, should I go get a PhD back east or should I do? So all those were possibilities. And, and I ended up going to art school at CU Boulder, which was really fortunate for me. And, so of course everybody were, including my family, were like, you're throwing away a science career to become a Dirtbag artist. And I was like, sounds good to me. And yeah, right. It was, it was a great time for it. It was in 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The eighties. His family doesn't understand, because the only interaction they have with artists is the occasional advertisement on TV for <span style="color:red" data-ts="268.62" data-end_ts="268.78" title="268.62" id=c_"268.62">__the__</span> starving artists Exactly. At the local Hyatt Regency. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>Right. And, and the reversal of Fortune was that I had a, my brother is a professor at Virginia Tech and Entomology now, but he had, he had been a filmmaker, and then he was like, I have to make good and become a scientist. And then I was a scientist and I was like, I have to make good and become a artist. So, so anyway, in the, in the long <span style="color:red" data-ts="290.26" data-end_ts="290.38" title="290.26" id=c_"290.26">__run__</span>, it, it actually panned out in that, I, I went to, CU Boulder and did my mfa. And, and then I ended up, being, actually the first Fulbright, from CU Boulder to, to be, in, in the MFA program to be awarded a Fulbright <span style="color:red" data-ts="309.72" data-end_ts="309.94" title="309.72" id=c_"309.72">__and__</span> ended up in South America for a year and a half, which was fantastic. It qualified you to do everything and nothing, which was just like having an MFA does. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>And, so I came and my MFA was in, was in sculpture. And so, when I came back from South America, I was teaching at CU Boulder and I began to bring in, web programming and things like that into the discipline to, to think about non-material ways of, of, thinking about immersive experience besides sculptural installation. And, and, the content that I was working with was actually the same content that I had been doing, my research base, which was about, extreme environments and, <span style="color:red" data-ts="357.76" data-end_ts="357.98" title="357.76" id=c_"357.76">__and__</span> endangerment in the environment and, and trying to raise consciousness with what's happening with our surroundings and how we're part of it. So I was doing that in the kind of white paper science mode before, but then I realized there was more than, one route to, immersing people in the dialogue. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>And so, my sculptural work, my sculptural installation work was about that whole notion of coming from the environment and being part of it. And as I moved further into new media, when I finished my mfa, I was, again, I was teaching at CU Boulder and, but then I was working for some software companies and doing environmental work, in, with, 3D modeling and 3D programming, and I was doing visualization with them. And so it was this crazy group of astrophysicists that had these ways of modeling black holes, but they wanted it translated into creative work. And I was lucky enough to have to be the one to do it <laugh>. So I was hanging out in Boulder with, this group spatial technology as, one of the visualization people in the, mid to to late nineties. And, and it was just a phenomenal time to just, kind of launch it all. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>I ended up teaching in, at, creative programming, unit in, at University of Yle in Sweden for a while and having students over there. And so it was a, it was a really wonderful time to be able to just open it all up and, and now you look back on it and go, how long ago was that? Oh my God. And, and, and in the, in the middle of it, somehow there was a gig that opened up at University of Denver in emergent, or in, in electronic media arts design. And I ended up taking a, a position there as a assistant professor and in digital media studies in emergent digital, practices is what came out of digital media studies. And that's where we are now. So the land of the, the island of misfit toys is where I ended up. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>And so what I, ha am still working with is, these ways of, translating kind of the, the, the bits, the informational bits to these, environmental inter how, what the equivalent of environmental interactions are. So it can be at a molecular level, it can be at, a level of working with lost species of also re witnessing what's happening out in the environment, going back to these, spaces of massive extinctions and, and bringing that back to be able to remix it in all these multiplicity of ways of how we work now. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Boy, there's a lot, lot there to discuss. I want to talk about a couple of things. First of all, the route that you took, so you went when you decided to sort of like jump from science to art, you took up sculpture Yeah. Which I think is really interesting. Yeah. Cause there're not a couple of people I know who kind of started diving into the media arts before media arts was an area of study Yeah. Seemed to gravitate towards sculpture. What is it about sculpture that you think, might be, might have been a draw for people? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>Well, it was a big container then. You know, it wasn't totally, so sculpture, it was interesting in the, in the late eighties and then the early nineties, it was pushing out into actually what new medias inherited, even in social space for social media. So, so public art that was really functional in, in communities was, there was nowhere to put it, so it ended up in sculpture. Right, right. So it was spatial interaction really, and spatial narrativity. So I'm still really drawn to spatial narrativity, but with new tools. So my, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="584.06" data-end_ts="584.3" title="584.06" id=c_"584.06">__infor__</span> having worked in sculpture installation and making objects, and also in these, these other forms of interaction that were pre electronic in a lot of ways, and then drawing video into installation and things like that, it became the big container. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I just think it's, it's odd though that that was the container that ended up drawing it, because <span style="color:red" data-ts="604.88" data-end_ts="605.1" title="604.88" id=c_"604.88">__you__</span>, there's anything that's like the opposite of sculpture. It's pictures of stuff on a flat screen. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>Yeah. Well, the immateriality that we talk about in digital media, but in reality, it, I mean, it's still drawing from some, transcoding or translation of materiality or form. So I think that awareness of form, whether it's, intera, you know, in, whether it's including it's object based, we're still drawing on that to, to pull to things like 3D printing, obviously, right. And 3D animation. But, for me, my, you know, my background in sculpture became really informative when I was doing software development and 3d 3D modeling and 3D kernels, because I knew what it should feel like. Right. And, and I could look at it on screen and have that simultaneity of, of information. Now that's, you know, in terms of the way that we've been trying, we try to inform our students is, I mean, everybody in, in our, my colleagues at in EDP or emergent digital practices at du, we all came from studio backgrounds. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>And so we, we built the foundation of, of things from what we knew about the material world. And now there's this, what we're assuming is might, there might be a gap. And there's also this craving to go back to have this hybridization between analog and digital, not just the digital island, which is actually really great. It's changed a lot of things for us. And, and I think that that's really welcoming versus, oh, you only live in VR the rest of your life. You know, and it's, I, it's difficult to compete when you walk out the door and go, oh my God, this is astounding. And so, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, there's, it's funny that you mentioned VR, because now with the Oculus <span style="color:red" data-ts="709.62" data-end_ts="709.9" title="709.62" id=c_"709.62">__riff__</span>, there's another, you know, there's another bit of excitement over the, over the VR thing, but Yeah, I don't know. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>I I think it's gonna be, I mean, they're talking about, yeah, this, you know, it going from VR to no interest in VR to Rebirth or vr, but now that'll naturally go back to Ahmad reality again, too, right? Because that was the follow <span style="color:red" data-ts="729.46" data-end_ts="729.66" title="729.46" id=c_"729.46">__up__</span> to VR before. And, and I think that, yeah, we still have a massive amount of, overlay work to do that, is really exciting. You know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So given that you came, you came to digital media through the sculpture route and sort of we're in, we're a part of the movement towards media art from once it didn't exist mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah. You know, I mean, early days, it was sort of like research based stuff to see if things could happen. But I don't think anybody had really done art. You were kind of there as it was turning into an art, art form. I, I would say, you know, at least, I don't know. Do you feel like that's where you were at, or, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>Well, I think that, I mean, there's a lot of different channels or streams that, you know, again, we, we just assume that this is the way they are right now. But, even like these aspects of getting exhibitions, you know, when, when the, even when the, you know, when email came up and link systems and all, I mean, all, it was just before that, it was like, I was doing work down in the Amazon and in the Andes, and you would wait three months for a letter to come out of the Amazon. Now you just, you know, I mean, I'm setting up some work to do in South America, around the, the un climate change conference coming up in December. And yeah, it's of course then there's ignoring emails and you're like, oh, Jesus, I haven't heard from these guys for three days. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>Well, it would've been three months and mid nineties. Right. And you're like, so, so those aspects of just trying to have the conversation is massive. But, and moving forward with it. But, but yeah, I think that, you know, breaking things loose so that people could, be as creative as possible to, to, you know, to move things forward. Co streaming with that was just having enough processor power to, you know, to be able to, to open it up. And, and I think there's that kind of crazy comparative thing of, this friend of mine years ago, he worked for IBM <span style="color:red" data-ts="855.56" data-end_ts="855.78" title="855.56" id=c_"855.56">__in__</span> Boulder, and, and he was really excited. He said, oh my God, we're, we finally reached a point where we think we're not limited by the processor to do kind of basic creative things. And I guess I, I mean, I, I, I, I've taught drawing, I've taught sculpture, but I've also taught Biom <span style="color:red" data-ts="871.14" data-end_ts="871.22" title="871.14" id=c_"871.14">__media__</span> and all sorts of other things with that. And I kept thinking like, well, we haven't reached the limits of the charcoal stick yet. Right. <laugh>. So, so, there's always that, that I guess I always reflect back on and trying to get things to, for creative opportunity and limitations is part of that. I think you, you know, rewiring things, we're still doing that. I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Mean, I think that's, yeah. So to what extent do you think that that something's, that something might be actually kind of lost by having people study media art as its own thing, rather than having to approach it from a, you know, maybe a more visceral or maybe just a, a different perspective? Because I mean, you came to art with this huge science background and, as we'll talk about in a minute, that's really informative of how you do your artwork. I mean, if somebody is sort of like, comes from, you know, being a kid and playing with games and watching TV Yeah. To then making videos and maybe making websites, and then they come to come into art and say, okay, I'm gonna study media art. Is there maybe not something lost by them not having a broader worldview? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>Well, I think that the rescue point in that is actually hacking, you know, that, that the way, you know, I, I think a lot of our students come in and they just assume like, oh, this is, this is the way that you get on the, you know, the, <span style="color:red" data-ts="961.6" data-end_ts="961.82" title="961.6" id=c_"961.6">__the__</span> knowledge train for, for, digital arts or new media or whatever. Like, we've got it all lined out. You, I mean, you've got this really incredible foundation for teaching sonic arts now, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="971.9" data-end_ts="972.06" title="971.9" id=c_"971.9">__that__</span>, so we have it logically laid out, and it's wonderful. The catalog of it is just, people look at it and it's mind boggling, but it's still in each one of those courses or each one of those means of, bringing someone along that their sense of, curiosity and hacking should still be embedded in it. You know, that, that making tools or, or hacking things that exist or, or rewinding the clock and, and revisiting things earlier instead of just, you know, again, the, the, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1002.8" data-end_ts="1003.02" title="1002.8" id=c_"1002.8">__pro__</span> the issue I would say, probably in the mid to late nineties is that everybody was assuming it was gonna be the digital island, and that was gonna be it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>And I think now we, you know, in terms of media arts, we, we understand it can be coming from anywhere, which is daunting. And also just <span style="color:red" data-ts="1021.01" data-end_ts="1021.3" title="1021.01" id=c_"1021.01">__asta__</span>, I mean, there's no limit. The, the limitations are not what we assumed. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, it's, and and it's really interesting the approach that, that, you know, at least in my experience, du has taken, which is to to constantly be fighting the battle to make sure that you don't become like a, a tech school for web design. Yeah, exactly. Even though I think sometimes students or maybe students' parents Yeah. Would love for them to come out of it with some skill. One of the things I notice is oftentimes students will come in thinking they have an idea for the kind of artists they're gonna become. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>And yeah, the preconceived notion is always interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. And then, and then the process that you go through to sort of like, tear them down and help them rebuild 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>Themselves. Well, I think that, yeah, the, the, the pressure of, you know, the, the, the, the, approach that we have is, yeah. It's, it's not a vocational program. Right? Right. And the, and the, the number of tools is astounding. So any one of those, approaches, I mean, we can, we can give a foundational, orientation on the tools that would be the, you know, really likely candidates to use. But, coming up with hybrid tools or hybrid processes is when it gets really, really interesting. And, and of course, the, what we are up against a lot, not always, but in a lot of cases, is that the parents want the value. Like, they're coming in and they're like, you know, what's the practicality of this? And so I guess that's, really how we landed with this notion of bringing emergence and complexity into the, into the curriculum. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>So, so the whole idea of, the, the, this whole multistream or, or hybridized influence of being like, we don't know what's gonna be born from something within 10 weeks of a course is of course, you, you tell that to a parent and they're like, what, what am I paying for? What are they, what are they paying for here? Like, what are they gonna get out of it? And the end? And it's like, and the answer is, I don't know. It's like, and then you have to just, you can't just leave it at, I don't know, because then it's like, oh, I'm, you're, you're paying this much per credit hour and the student's gonna come out in an, I don't know, mode. The problem is actually the opposite is that the students are, there's, the opportunities right at this point in time are astounding, and they're getting poached midstream, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>And kind of directed in a way that isn't wide open enough. And so I think that whole notion of emergence and, these influences coming in, there might be a new device, like we were talking earlier about the Oculus Rift. Like what's that doing in terms of like, this notion of VR now, like the rebirth of vr. And so you throw that on the table, like, oh my God, this thing just came out of a Kickstarter project. Like we've got the prototype, let's start working with it within like a week or two weeks. You're gonna be seeing something you never would've predicted the first week of the quarter. Right? Right. And so that notion of the complexity, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1199.38" data-end_ts="1199.58" title="1199.38" id=c_"1199.38">__multi__</span> multiplicity of influence could create an emergent pattern that you have no idea about. And that is where, you know, we've, we've <span style="color:red" data-ts="1207.2" data-end_ts="1207.42" title="1207.2" id=c_"1207.2">__inc__</span> included that in the curriculum because I can't tell parents what their student or their, their kids get gonna be doing in four years. You know? And, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You know, the flip side of it is, I think maybe that story is a little easier to tell now than it would've been 10 years ago. Yeah. Because I think now at this point, most parents, and, you know, I'm a parent with a kid that's soon gonna be going to college. Yeah. I don't want my son to learn a thing. I want him to learn how to be Yeah. How to be a good learner. Because at this point, exactly. When I went, when I went to college, it was a really big thing to be, to go and be an electrical engineer. Yeah, exactly. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1245.87" data-end_ts="1246.22" title="1245.87" id=c_"1245.87">__Cause__</span> you can get a great job. Yeah. And if you learn all this analog technology, you could be a great designer and have an excellent job. And all those people that I know from back then are all outta work because nobody needs that kind of engineer. Exactly. Most of that engineering is offshore somewhere. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>Yeah. If you, if you rattle the parental memory of, I mean, I, I think that yeah, that, that case of, I, I remember when I, I went in as a freshman and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1272.6" data-end_ts="1272.82" title="1272.6" id=c_"1272.6">__it__</span> was, there was a geology boom and everybody was gonna be a geologist. And they went in and, and they, and so because they're looking at who's coming out four years downstream at Purdue, and these kids are getting amazing jobs. By the time those, those ingoing geology majors finished, there were no jobs. There were no jobs left <span style="color:red" data-ts="1288.94" data-end_ts="1289.1" title="1288.94" id=c_"1288.94">__there__</span>. And it was the same thing for chemi, right. Electrical engineering, all those things. And so if you rattle that and you talk about, you know, and, and, and initiate that in terms of, the conversation, the parents that they do understand it. Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1303.82" data-end_ts="1304.06" title="1303.82" id=c_"1303.82">__They__</span>, then they understand it. And then you talk about, I mean these lofty, ideas about emergence, like, what the hell is emergence? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>You know, and, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1312.6" data-end_ts="1312.82" title="1312.6" id=c_"1312.6">__and__</span> my, you know, response is, well, if you flew here probably to talk to us when you were flying through the clouds coming into Denver, if you looked out the window that was emergence, doesn't mean you're just up in the clouds. It just, weather is an emergent phenomena and you cannot totally predict it. Thus, you know, we have weathermen that get it right 80% of the time, but there's 20% that's unpredictable. And oh my God, there could be a downpour this afternoon we weren't thinking about. Right. So, so being open to thinking about emergence and, and, and this notion of complexity, is something that, you know, in all of our work is actually really welcoming, but it's also really, unsettling too. Like, and so I think it's, I was reading this, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1363.54" data-end_ts="1363.66" title="1363.54" id=c_"1363.54">__I__</span>, a lot of times when I'm like, kind of frozen in my brain freeze, what I can, what I do is I just find what's in front of me on the bookshelf, pull it off, randomly open the page and go, this is interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>Sometimes, sometimes it's like, oh my God, this is just such crap. But, but luck. I was down at, our place in Santa Fe and there was an old <span style="color:red" data-ts="1384.75" data-end_ts="1385.1" title="1384.75" id=c_"1384.75">__Ellen__</span> Watts copy. There was a, the price on it was a dollar 75, so that's how old it was. Right. And I flipped the book out, and I look, and it's, he was talking about making sense of the marvelous meaninglessness, you know, of, of that's what, that's what we're doing here. Yeah. You know, and I think that a lot of it is that we're, we're launching our own social patterns and patterns of inquiry and creative inquiry for our residents on earth. And, and that's an important thing to, that in itself is really, really important to have the privilege of being able to do. And I think that, you know, no matter how lofty or intellectual or deep technically or all these things, like, you know, the, the, like, getting through the marvelous meaninglessness is important. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Yeah. That's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1436.38" data-end_ts="1436.5" title="1436.38" id=c_"1436.38">__a__</span>, that's kind of an awesome place to, take people. Yeah. And you're, you're very, I dunno, I always think of you as being like one of those elves that helps people <laugh> find an interesting path. You know, that's the way I, I experienced you when you were an instructor. And since then, just as a, as an artist and we've, you know, our paths have crossed occasionally in that world. I've seen that. Now, one of the things I want to talk a little bit, and this is kind of going back in the conversation, is I wanna talk about your art. Because much of this discussion so far has been about your work as an educator, but your artwork is really extremely important. And, I it's, it was the catalyst behind, behind having you be on this podcast as well. My first experience with it was when you, actually invited me down to <span style="color:red" data-ts="1491.76" data-end_ts="1491.98" title="1491.76" id=c_"1491.76">__the__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1492.06" data-end_ts="1492.18" title="1492.06" id=c_"1492.06">__u__</span> and I had a very interesting thing, which is you had, you had done, an art exhibit with some, some others. And, there were some problems I was helping out with it. But while we were there, they were <span style="color:red" data-ts="1507.4" data-end_ts="1507.62" title="1507.4" id=c_"1507.4">__had__</span>, they had like the docents coming through 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>And Oh, yeah. This was the show at the dam <span style="color:red" data-ts="1512.44" data-end_ts="1512.66" title="1512.44" id=c_"1512.44">__of__</span> the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1512.78" data-end_ts="1513.02" title="1512.78" id=c_"1512.78">__Denver__</span> Museum. Yeah. And, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The docents was just like, they were there talking about the piece, kind of getting the docents of able to talk about it. And they were like, oh, here's the artist. Yeah. <laugh>. Right. And so, they asked you to come and talk to him a little bit about it, and I kinda sat back and listened to you talk about it. And I was totally entranced because, the tale that you wove was one of a locus species that was, that was in the area. And how it was, it was an overwhelming influence on the, on the locale. They had swarming issues because of man's incursion on, on the area mm-hmm. <affirmative> and all of this stuff. And, it really made, it made the artwork for me really come alive. But also it, it was a really interesting story for me to hear or to see in a very real fashion how you can take things like in biological science, but also informatics. And then, visual and sonic arts and kind of meld them into an installation that was beautiful. And then since then, I've gotten a chance to interact with other work <span style="color:red" data-ts="1588.56" data-end_ts="1588.78" title="1588.56" id=c_"1588.56">__you__</span>, the book piece that you did, which was really quite stunning. And in the piece that you did where you were doing the, the things with the, the graphite drawings. Yeah. The graphite drawings, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Those are, those are pieces I've seen. And they're really interesting because again, now, you know, with that intro, that first introduction, I really gotta see how you <span style="color:red" data-ts="1611.38" data-end_ts="1611.5" title="1611.38" id=c_"1611.38">__were__</span> drawing in from so many different wells in order to make your work. Why don't you talk a little bit about, now I, I just basically like spilled the beans on what you do, <laugh>, sorry about that. But why don't you tell us a little bit about how you approach that, because you've got this history in science and, which really was, provides a nice foundation for this. But you've taken a lot farther than just sort of saying, here's some science and I'm gonna put some fancy pictures and call it. Good. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>Well, I, I, I, I think part, a lot of the basis of building the means of inquiry that I'm, that I'm, that I'm really in love with, there's these aspects of collecting and then there's also this, part of, coming to grips with the privilege of being able to read these codes that are important to be translated, for the public at large. And then also make them, creating a new sensoria so people can be immersed in them. Other than, where the, the path of reading these codes is, is limited. So, so for example, I had worked four years in protein engineering, so we were developing new proteins for therapeutics, for human disease. And, I knew how to read the protein codes and new, the significance of the proteins cuz proteins, enzymes, and, and those classes of molecules are incredibly, directed. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>I mean, they, it's a, it's, it's always related to as a, you know, a, a key and a keyhole phenomenon just fits together. And that's why, okay, this one that'll clock in your body works, or, or, or not. I mean, that's also why disease persists. So, so it's something that, you know, somebody goes to the doctor and they don't talk to their doctor on that level. Like, well, what about this enzyme failing in my body and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1742.98" data-end_ts="1743.1" title="1742.98" id=c_"1742.98">__da__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1743.1" data-end_ts="1743.22" title="1743.1" id=c_"1743.1">__da__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1743.22" data-end_ts="1743.34" title="1743.22" id=c_"1743.22">__da__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1743.34" data-end_ts="1743.46" title="1743.34" id=c_"1743.34">__da__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1743.46" data-end_ts="1743.54" title="1743.46" id=c_"1743.46">__da__</span>. Because it's, you know, routinely for, biological scientists, it's, it's, it's a long crazy path to be able to get to the point of understanding of these really complex phenomenon might be 25 years, it might be 30 years, and it's, and it's tied together with life cycles of beings. So I did that for about 15 years. And, and, I really loved it, but I, but I also realized that there's other ways that this should be opened up to the public so you can have a broader dialogue. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>And again, going back to the, island of misfit toys, it just, all the pieces were like, oh my God, this is something that's really important to talk about now. Because now we talk about not just in the, in the media world, like all these incredible tools that, I mean, I always think that, you know, the laptop computers the most astounding folk art instrument ever <span style="color:red" data-ts="1799.33" data-end_ts="1799.82" title="1799.33" id=c_"1799.33">__because__</span> it, it can be anything. Right? Right. And so, and so whether it's folk music or folk art or all these things that, you know, you have this level of tech, technology that has to be right or it doesn't work, but you also can just pull things together in this way and link them up that have never been possible. And that's how I really approach it. But getting back to this notion of these, these exclusive codes that are in the, are open source, okay, if we, we go online and we want to know about, I don't know, like the, the, like certain, like the way that the energy system in say, a condor works, you know, how does it fly? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>How does it, we can get online and within literally three minutes we can find the basic components of, of what if we can get through the codes, like, oh my God, here's all the pieces and the codes that, are the building blocks of the way this animal flies to these in incredible heights. But, I can read that, but not everybody can read it. There's like less than a, like a hundredth of a percent of the population of the planet that could possibly reach that. And so I want to be able to open that up and, and say, okay, here's these building blocks, but I also, and, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1876.96" data-end_ts="1877.18" title="1876.96" id=c_"1876.96">__ha__</span> and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1877.4" data-end_ts="1877.62" title="1877.4" id=c_"1877.4">__may__</span> and build immersive experiences that relate, to these new means that we, we think we, evaluate other life forms mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And so, so opening up these codes, because I'm privileged to have been able to read those codes before is, I mean, I see it as a res somewhat a responsibility, but I also want to be able to have a broader dialogue about it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>How do we make music with it? How do we make sound art? How do we take these bits that seem, meaningless in some way and put them into the sense that we can actually interact with them, whether it's in a sound envelope or whether it's something that might be material, it might be something that is, a surface we can touch and, and, and then start to talk about these, relevant issues of our times that, that these, life forms might be slipping away by touching these, these ways that the science community evaluates the value of these life forms. So, so, so that's part of the collecting that I've done. And, because of the privilege that I have through the university, but also as a scientist and an artist, I can find collaborators that have amazing resources to draw on for raw material, for making new, experiences that way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>So I can go to the Museum of Nature and Science and say, I really wanna look at all of these lost species and the final residues you have of them. And, and the, and so I'm very fortunate in that I work a lot with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1969.88" data-end_ts="1970.1" title="1969.88" id=c_"1969.88">__the__</span> Museum of Nature and Science in the archives of the museum in Zoology. And I've worked as a fellow there and, and I'm a research associate at the, the Denver Museum of Nature and Science. And I can say, okay, here's the last of the passenger pigeons. Here's the last of the imperial woodpecker. Here's the last, all these things that are at the cascade of a massive extinction that is, we're in the middle of right now. Pull those out of the cabinets and use them in some way so that, others can, access them through, through creative venture. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>So, so, so the process that I've, you know, that I've become, there, there's somewhat of a li <span style="color:red" data-ts="2011.3" data-end_ts="2011.42" title="2011.3" id=c_"2011.3">__a__</span> liberation of these things, you know, that, that's interesting to me. But then there's also this part of saying, okay, here's the building blocks. How do I then, bring people together to be able to have the dialogue, whether it's scientists and or artists or the public, but then also open it up so that I can build tools and do workshops and say, okay, transcoding is something that, I mean, we talk a lot about, the tools that, that we converge on, especially in, max, are astounding for doing, building new sensoria to new experiences in these very complex pieces of data and enabling people to interact with them, whether they're moving through a space, whether they're listening, where they're creating. And it opens up the dialogue in this whole other way that, normal, reading something about, the loss of a certain species is, leaves you kind of, hopeless. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, I want to talk that, that actually leads into something I'm curious about, and you are giving me the opportunity to ask about, and that is really about the politics of what it is you're doing. Yeah. And so, you know, there's, I mean, we could talk about the act, you know, what people would commonly think of as politics, which would be, you know, you're talking about species extinction, you know, is that real? I don't want to go there as much as I want to talk about, or I'd like to ask you questions about the choices you make because mm-hmm. <affirmative>, as you stated, you're one of a relatively few people who can look at these protein codes and come out with something, some useful interpretation of 'em. Right. That also puts a pretty huge onus on you to not be selective about the codes you choose to portray in the codes that you choose to hide. And I think for, for people who don't, who aren't informed about this stuff, there's always a level of suspicion that says, how do I know that the thing that this person is presenting represents on in a non, or at least a limited level of politics attached to it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>Yeah. I that I, that, that's really interesting because there's a point where, I mean, people expect scientists to be incredibly objective. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, they never expect artists to be objective <laugh>. They're always like, that's, that's subjectivity at its finest <span style="color:red" data-ts="2167.86" data-end_ts="2168.02" title="2167.86" id=c_"2167.86">__and__</span> its worst. Right. Good point. So, so hybridizing art and science of making a, a, you know, I mean, the, the, there's incredible, there's, there's an incredible emphasis on, what I would call art science arranged marriages. You know, like, we'll bring artists and science scientists together, we'll sit 'em at a table and then voila, they'll fantastic stuff 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Will show 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>Up. Oh my God. Like, look at this. This is so great. But the reality is it comes down to chemistry, just like any collaboration. And, and the one thing that, and I go to a lot of gigs, whether they're international conferences or where that that dialogue is on the table. And it's interesting because, you, you, more cases than not, you have scientists that are wanna be artists and they make lousy art, and or you have artists that are wanna be scientists and they make shitty science. Right. And so you end up nowhere with it. Right. Right, right. And so, so you end up with this kind of, I don't know, effort that's just, and, and new forms of creativity are, you know, they're being born every day. And that's why I was saying this whole notion of hacking, scientists look at citizen science, as hacking, but citizen science is really, really important in a lot of, so that opportunity, so, so this idea of trying to maintain a what I do is that in the projects that I have, I, I think about the preliminary parts of the platform as having a really rigid scientific platform, so <span style="color:red" data-ts="2256.9" data-end_ts="2257.02" title="2256.9" id=c_"2256.9">__that__</span> if we, if we draw back to the scientific platform, then we can critique it in a way that is, it's not, it's never gonna be neutral from the politics. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>Right. I mean, the, the, the, there's a big emphasis right now on, you know, it's the hundredth anniversary of the extinction of a, a bunch of different species that are very iconic. The passenger pigeon, the Carolina parakeet, and, and it's interesting. They're birds. They're very iconic species, but they're, and they were human induced extinctions. There's a lot of collateral damage of non <span style="color:red" data-ts="2290.44" data-end_ts="2290.86" title="2290.44" id=c_"2290.44">__iconic__</span> species that we wouldn't be talking about, like, oh, worms and, you know, like weeds and I mean, all sorts of things that aren't iconic species, but they've had an incredible impact on, on our environment and what's declined. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="2305.54" data-end_ts="2305.74" title="2305.54" id=c_"2305.54">__in__</span> a lot of times we we'll never even know what's going on Yeah. Behind the scenes. So, so the, the, there's a, so there's, there's a lot of emphasis in the dialogue on thinking about, these iconic species. So it's a, it's actually a really great place to, to have the dialogue and try to keep the foundation neutral and objective. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>But then I wanna be an artist. I, I mean, I, I still am doing scientific investigation, but that isn't all I do. So saying that I can talk about the platform of what I'm doing to the scientist, then talking about these new experimental sensoria on top of it, that's the way I navigate it. So, so, but it still is that, I'm not saying, I do a lot of field work, which is great because I was a lab scientist when I was doing, doing, protein engineering and in, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2357.04" data-end_ts="2357.26" title="2357.04" id=c_"2357.04">__in__</span> environmental engineering and things like that and, and microbiology. But now I, I split the time between, working with these trans coatings and the specifics of these molecules, and then going out to where these massive extinction events happened. Right. Because I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2373.34" data-end_ts="2373.54" title="2373.34" id=c_"2373.34">__want__</span> to witness what's there now. So it might be going to, I just got back from Iceland last spring where the last of the great a was hunted into extinction. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>I was working in Newfoundland before that, where there were millions and millions of, of this species slaughtered for their feathers for the feather beds of Europe. My, last month I was working down in the Andes, because it's the most profound site for glacial, re retreat and the impact on these incredible biodiverse areas of, of South America is happening. And so, so I guess there's also this part of trying to understand it on the ground myself. Yeah. And then I'm also then finally coming to grips that I'm part, I'm not just this casual observer looking through the glass at it. I'm in the middle of it from my own vulnerability from some really crazy things that happened to me. And so I can take my own medical analysis and embed that in it now. Right. Which is great. So, so I think that we'll never be, if things are gonna be politicized, we'll never be, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2441.09" data-end_ts="2441.58" title="2441.09" id=c_"2441.09">__they're__</span>, they're gonna be politicized. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>But I think that there's this part of the immersive experience that I've, I, 25 years ago, we were talking about this earlier, I, I did a lot of very intensely frontal political work. It gets, it can be dismissed as easily as I just, I just put 50 cents in a newspaper machine. And there, there's today's headline. Oh, well that's today, tomorrow, it won't be on there. And so the, the super politicized work that I was doing 25 or even 30 years ago could be, was dis was beautiful work. Yeah. But easily dismissed, but could easily dismissed. Versus if somebody is scratching their head or waking up in the middle of the night from an immersive experience and continuing to think about it, or having a conversation with, their, you know, their, their <span style="color:red" data-ts="2490.5" data-end_ts="2490.74" title="2490.5" id=c_"2490.5">__child__</span>, their child, or their, their kids about it, then that hesitation is where I want to be. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>And so I, I think that, and, and there's a, it's, it's heavy stuff. I was approached by this woman at this show a couple years ago, and she was, she, she said, well, what, why, what do you, you're talking about extinctions here. There's no extinctions. And I was like, well, there are extinctions every day. And she said, well, that's natural. Extinctions are natural. And I said, well, human induced extinctions are, I guess they are natural to a degree, but that's what we're talking about. And it's a different, dialogue, but I'm also dealing with it in a way where the audience by interactive experience in a space can attach themselves to a sound envelope. And then they're carrying that through the space. And then that is the, you know, pointing back to the dialogue. And, but what I didn't realize, which is like, you know, really, the responsibility of the parent or, or someone in the family is, I always think about, you know, when your mom or dad were, you know, they're the person that set your cosmology. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>They said, that's the moon, or that's the sun. It's the same thing, like a parent telling a kid, like, oh, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2562.2" data-end_ts="2562.42" title="2562.2" id=c_"2562.2">__the__</span>, you know, humanity killed off this species. And it was, it was beautiful. And I think that, you know, that was the one thing with this mom. She was like, she didn't want her daughter to know that humans were responsible for wiping out, you know, this gorgeous species that we'll never see again. So, so I think that, you know, I don't know how we got there, but, you know, but, but again, that is something that is gonna be politicized. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I think, I think it's important though, because the kind of, the kind of politics that you're bringing to it, is it an important one to me because it causes a conversation to occur. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah. And, and maybe if, if you think of the most powerful art, there's a tendency, especially in our media art world, to, to be the first person to expose a shiny object, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>Yeah. Yeah. The, the, exactly. You, and we love eye candy or ear candy. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, yeah. Or, or, yeah. The, the grievous new 3D printer thing, or the grievous new microprocessor thing that can make whizzbang displays. But so oftentimes that stuff, much like you were talking about with political art, it ends up becoming tiresome almost overnight because it's immediately eclipsed by the next thing. Mm-hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b><affirmative>. Yeah. I, I think that, that, those tiers of, you know, whether you're on the, new media festival route and there's specific new media festivals that want, you know, the new interface or the new, you know, new device and, and how do you use it? And then there's other tiers that are like, we want content, but then they thematically have their festival around content that year. Right. So you look at, like, say the way Transmedial operates, or, or Siggraph. I mean, I think they're two different, and they, they have gone through different kind of iterations and, and passages in terms of the way they've, they've looked at, you know, in the late nineties, SIGGRAPH was like, oh my God, you're actually using the internet to make art <laugh>. You know, it was amazing just the fact that you used the, the web and you had content on there. That's great. But now, and then it, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's kind of, they've kind of swung back to the exactly thing about like, oh, look at, look at, the speed that our, we can get out of our gpu. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So let's talk a little bit about the process behind your work. So you, as you, as you said, you go out and you do field work, which in your case represents what? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>Well, the, there, there's, there's two levels of, the, the, the project that I've been working on for about actually the last six years is a project called, the, the series is called <span style="color:red" data-ts="2737.33" data-end_ts="2737.62" title="2737.33" id=c_"2737.33">__Leaa__</span>. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="2738.89" data-end_ts="2739.18" title="2738.89" id=c_"2738.89">__Leaa__</span> conceptually, actually, refers to the lost, the, the usage of that originally were the lost forests of, Greece that were cut into nothing for the Bronze Age to fire the melding of the bronze. And it became something that was lost, these lost forests. And, and then the next kinda surfacing in, cultural history about the use of the word <span style="color:red" data-ts="2764.84" data-end_ts="2765.06" title="2764.84" id=c_"2764.84">__hia__</span> or the use of the term <span style="color:red" data-ts="2766.16" data-end_ts="2766.38" title="2766.16" id=c_"2766.16">__HIA__</span> came from Humboldt, when he landed in the Neotropical Forest of South America. And he had, and here's these amazing biodiverse environments. And in his mind, he had found <span style="color:red" data-ts="2779.09" data-end_ts="2779.38" title="2779.09" id=c_"2779.09">__alah__</span>, these lost forests that were, oh, here it is. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And so, and so that's very, when in <span style="color:red" data-ts="2785.64" data-end_ts="2785.86" title="2785.64" id=c_"2785.64">__the__</span>, in Neotropical ecology, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2789.12" data-end_ts="2789.34" title="2789.12" id=c_"2789.12">__hi__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2789.37" data-end_ts="2789.66" title="2789.37" id=c_"2789.37">__Leia__</span> is constantly referred to in, in, in, in, in those elements. And then, but then also what's interesting is the, the futurist in Italy, in the 1930s referred to <span style="color:red" data-ts="2801.26" data-end_ts="2801.42" title="2801.26" id=c_"2801.26">__Hi__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2801.45" data-end_ts="2801.74" title="2801.45" id=c_"2801.45">__Leia__</span> as their panacea and their utopian community as well that was being reformed. So, so, so the, the metadata of hi is what I'm really working with is bringing these pieces back to, I, I mean, I can't say they're remixed, they're kind of resynthesize and from, from these different bits. And so, my process, one of the pieces of metadata, which is important, is, okay, I'm talking about what occurred or is still occurring in these environments. It might be the Redwoods in California, it might be coastal environments in South America or in, in Iceland. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>But I wanna be able to just, you know, go there and take this bit from it to say, here it is. At this point in time, I was listening to a lecture <span style="color:red" data-ts="2850.66" data-end_ts="2850.86" title="2850.66" id=c_"2850.66">__of__</span> Brian Greens yesterday and, and, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2853.12" data-end_ts="2853.34" title="2853.12" id=c_"2853.12">__and__</span>, and his, and of course there's this notion of past, present, and future. They're all happening at the same time, but I can't get back there mm-hmm. <affirmative>. So I just, you know, I, I I, I do a lot of field recording, and that becomes the foundation of interactive installation or, or what I'm calling afterlife cinema projects. They're relating to the afterlife of these, these environments or the presence of it. The other bits that I, that I mine are, from open source data sources of, kind of new biology, data or new bioinformatics or eco informatics, which are, they might be DNA information. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>They might be protein information from certain species. They might be other environmental conditions. And those are things that are constantly being, thrown into libraries and they're accessible online. And, but again, they're coded. And, what I do with those bits are, create a transcoding base from them that might, create a vi a visual transcoding where it might be, say, a sequence of images from these environments. And then I can overlay that onto a protein, code of say that, you know, from a species, that environment, and it can interpret the visual, information from that space. So, so, I've been working on a project in the Redwoods in California, which is, you know, here's this last little spit of these magnificent gigantic trees, and it was a dominant species on earth for 26 million years, and now it's in the Santa Cruz mountains. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>Right. And it's, you know, so you go there and, and it's one of those environments where you're like, I don't even know what to say. I mean, it's amazing. Yeah. And then we were also talking about the, the acoustics of that space. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2963.1" data-end_ts="2963.5" title="2963.1" id=c_"2963.1">__Correct__</span>. When we were talking about, sampling, for convolution reverb to be able to say, okay, can I move this digital space by capturing the, you know, some sample from it, and then, and, you know, creating the digital acoustics of the forest and be able to bring that back to, to an environment or an interactive environment or a performance. So all those bits, again, I had mentioned about the collecting, and they're the metadata that I'm collecting to be able to compose from. And I might end up in a, a sound composition. I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2996.26" data-end_ts="2996.42" title="2996.26" id=c_"2996.26">__be__</span>, I've worked for a couple years around this notion of human crypto chromic proteins or crypto proteins, as crypto chromic proteins are really an interesting protein that exist in all species. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>And they are, what roots, time and, you know, for species. So they're, they're integral in circadian rhythms. They're integral in biological clocks, and then they're light sensitive, how, how time, time works individual, how time works specifically for that species. And it senses <span style="color:red" data-ts="3025.82" data-end_ts="3025.9" title="3025.82" id=c_"3025.82">__a__</span> biological time and how that species deals with light. So it might be that we navigate by light. We, we, for migration, we grow by light. If you're a tree, you, and so all species have these crypto <span style="color:red" data-ts="3039.86" data-end_ts="3040.14" title="3039.86" id=c_"3039.86">__chronic__</span> proteins. So, so I looked at that as this kind of, really interesting audio compositional base, that it's what is responsible for humans exploring and taking over new land and things like that. So it be, it became a persistent theme in a lot of different sound, environments that I was building for a few years. And, so, so I would compose around treating the crypto protein sequence as an instrument or as another layer of right of sound for, for a polyphonic bass of, of, of, of a space. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>And somebody could walk into a space and then activate this, or I could play it doing a live cinema piece. And so, but, and, and again, the, this whole notion of transcoding of proteins at, Peter Gina at the Chicago Art Institute, he, he started doing that work years ago, but it was stuck on the notion of like, oh, it's, I can do this translation and it's interesting by itself, and I'm interested in what about the entire genome? What about the con putting it into a content base of saying, I've got all the proteins for the bio for the way that, you know, a certain insect or a bird flies by from its bio, bioenergetic system. And then I can compose a, a piece from it by transcoding, to these, to a sound base. So essentially you're tuning the protein to a degree by saying, okay, here, these residues, they follow all over three octaves of, you know, of notes, based on the, solubility of one of these molecules and, and the, and the physical characteristics of the whole series. And then you can tune the protein that way and use it as an instrument. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So how, it sounds to me, like, I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>Know that's trippy, but 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's like, no, it, it is, it's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>Black, black magic. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, but I'm curious, like, just from a compositional standpoint, then, when you take some arbitrary set of data Yeah. Like from one of these proteins or Yeah. Or, whatever, and you try sonifying it, how often do things just do you do it and just say, oh, it it is technically correct. Right. But it's not 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>Interesting. Interesting. Yeah. Well, I, again, the, the basis of it is, you know, the, where, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3190.33" data-end_ts="3190.62" title="3190.33" id=c_"3190.33">__what__</span> I'm trying to hold to is, I have a way to tune the protein or retune the protein and, and or the DNA sequence or whatever I'm working with in terms of these molecular sequences that are being transcoded to audio sequences. And so you have these other variables then to work with that are just incredible. The timestamp, the pitch shift, the, I mean, it's amazing. And then, and then also putting it into other context to be able to interact with it is, in a lot of ways it's, it's, it's, yeah, it's luck that you run into something that's interesting. But again, that's when you get to become an artist, right? And so that's, that's what's important of making that, you know, that shift and saying, okay, now we're in s from objective land to super subjective land. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>I have to move ahead with this and, and work intuitively with it versus analytically mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And, what's interesting to me is that, I, I mean, this goes back to the whole art science chemistry thing that I was doing a lecture down at the Santa Fe Institute a couple years ago about transcoding and, that's a hard crowd to play to <laugh>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3266.28" data-end_ts="3266.5" title="3266.28" id=c_"3266.28">__Oh__</span>, bad. That's, that's trial by fire. And there's some amazing minds there. It's just an astounding place. And there was, one of the scientists that was a visiting scientist was, really interested but really critical in, you know, about this whole notion of transcoding of proteins mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And he, it turned out he was head of the, eco Informatics Institute at University of Zurich. And I was like, Jesus, okay, we'll work with this <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>And so he, but he was real critical when I was lecturing, and then afterwards he was like, this is astounding. I want to assign this postdoc to you because this is so important because we are just frozen in data <span style="color:red" data-ts="3303.53" data-end_ts="3303.82" title="3303.53" id=c_"3303.53">__land__</span>. Right. You know, and we have no new sensoria to work with, and you're stepping forward with these tools. And it turned out that he was, he had, he was a musician uhhuh, and so the chemistry just happened to be there, whereas people that were, protein chemists were just like, that's the biggest bunch of bullshit I've ever heard. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I mean, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>Just, you never know where it's landing. Actually, people at the Santa Fe Institute would never say that. They would conceivably, they, they're very 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Ill. They would think it, but <laugh>, they, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>They would probably think it, but they would be really open-minded. And there's some phenomenal, people down there right now that are opening up that argument. But you are, yeah. You're really, it's important to be an artist, when you have to be an artist and not say like, I'm a scientist too. And Right. Watching yourself just get gunned to death and in front of everybody. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, well good. I mean, like you said, get beat up as an artist who's doing poor 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>Science. Yeah, exactly. So the, the astounding thing is the amount of variables to work with and, with, you know, the tools we have or building your own tools, like in Max are just, that's why I, we always had that argument. I'm like, I look at Max as this incredible toolkit for artists, but it's an astounding toolkit for scientists, right. That's just like, wide open. And, and I think that, you know, cuz you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3379.42" data-end_ts="3379.62" title="3379.42" id=c_"3379.42">__th__</span> this whole notion of building these new possibilities is right there. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>To what extent do you think we need, boy, this has gone long in <span style="color:red" data-ts="3389.26" data-end_ts="3389.34" title="3389.26" id=c_"3389.26">__it__</span>. Yeah. There's like 10,000 other things I'd like to ask you about <laugh>, but, it strikes me when I look at, when I look at what's being put out there as sort of like visualization and visualization of big data and all this stuff Yeah. Which is sort of getting to be a meme at the moment. Yeah. Yeah. It also seems to me like people are really focused on really beautiful first order implementations of the data. Yeah. That there isn't, that there's almost more of an interest in doing a really cool looking surface than there is in getting deeper into the data. How does that get, how does that get turned around? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>Well, I, I think it, you know, the, the, the stage of the, the encounter, the movement is, is early, you know, in terms of like exercising in its infancy. Yeah. It's, it's infancy. So if you even think about it, like, you know, in terms of cinematic arts and playing out, you know, other themes that, I mean, I always say like, oh, we've, we haven't done, you know, live cinema based documentaries or animated films or, I mean, even those, those kind of like genres. But, you know, I keep going back to, there's a project that I, that I really wanted that, that I'm, it, it's, it's always on the shelf, but I have to get to it, is this project called Protein Noir, which is going back to the idea of film noir, but it being expressed through these proteins that are about, that get expressed during, fear or, you know, these encounters that are classic film noir themes. Right. So, so it might be about adrenal proteins, it might be about he hemoglobin, it might be about these things. And you, you remix film noir themes, classic ones based on the soundtrack, being recomposed from, protein noir, soundtracks. Right. Right. So, so I think that yeah, we're, we're so early in it that we haven't gone to the dark themes per se. Right. You know, or, or, or these other aspects of experimental, parts of the media that are still pretty wide open. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that's, that's interesting you say, because you know, every time a new book on visualization comes out, I'll scamper off and get it and look at it and just be kind of disappointed. Yeah. That the state of the art seems to be not very state-of-the art. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>Yeah. There's, there's two books I just got that I'm, I'm looking at, there's a, I'm teaching a bio <span style="color:red" data-ts="3536.9" data-end_ts="3537.14" title="3536.9" id=c_"3536.9">__media__</span> class, that is gonna be a true <span style="color:red" data-ts="3540.06" data-end_ts="3540.46" title="3540.06" id=c_"3540.06">__science__</span>, art science class this, coming spring with, you know, half biology majors and half EDP majors that I'm hoping, I mean, the, the, actually the biology department's hounding me on it, which is awesome, <laugh>. But the books that I'm looking at for it are, it, it's interesting like what's, you know, the people are writing on, and one of 'em is on molecular aesthetics, which was like, I was like, and, and some of it I'm not very into, but some of it's like really amazing to think about this other tier of media being molecularly oriented. And the other one is on Fat Fazal medium. And we've talked about that in terms of afterlife. Like we're looking at these bits of, residues of lost species, whether they're, they're protein sequences or phylogenomics sequences and saying, oh, this family split 26 million years ago. Well, that's a narrative backbone for media to ride on. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. To tell these stories. And especially as, as we're finding that some of those residences exist beyond the, sort of beyond the grave in a 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>Way. Exactly. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3602.04" data-end_ts="3602.26" title="3602.04" id=c_"3602.04">__Yep__</span>. And we, you know, and there's this whole, you know, the, the Long Now foundation is, is investigating, de-extinction, and it's very much like, okay, we're gonna bring back the pro, the, the, you know, the passenger pigeon, dammit, like it's gonna happen. And so that's a really active dialogue like, no habitat, like how's that work? And so, so I've been working, this year I just did a, a project with the Museum of Nature and Science, and it was, it was great. It was really exciting because they, they let me do the performance in the <span style="color:red" data-ts="3633.77" data-end_ts="3634.06" title="3633.77" id=c_"3633.77">__rear__</span> bird hall. So I got to do two big video screens that we're used to for the live cinema work, but then I got to light the, dioramas of the <span style="color:red" data-ts="3643.14" data-end_ts="3643.34" title="3643.14" id=c_"3643.14">__pass__</span> all these lost species as these other nodes for the performance space, where, you know, the, the dusty diorama then becomes this incredible color lit mm-hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b><affirmative> piece and the performance. And, and so we were talking about earlier of, I've been working a lot with these, morphology drawings, which are the, you know, the, the form of say a wing or a certain specific part of a, a, of a species. And I'm drawing over those with, graphite and then, sending wirelessly back and forth to my, my da or my audio unit or, or from max. And I built this little, what I'm calling a probe <span style="color:red" data-ts="3683.81" data-end_ts="3684.1" title="3683.81" id=c_"3683.81">__dino__</span>, which can probe parts of the drawing, the graphite circuitry, circuitry, and treat the drawing over the, like a, what was a direct scan and printed image on paper of the passenger pigeon as an instrument. So, so there's, there's some, there's all sorts of different ways to interact with this, this data and these notions of what lifeform are that are the styling, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3710.18" data-end_ts="3710.26" title="3710.18" id=c_"3710.18">__the__</span> wide open, either coming from the informatics or new biology realm, but, or the, the tools that we can hack or build in our domain. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3718.1" data-end_ts="3718.26" title="3718.1" id=c_"3718.1">__Right__</span>. Which is, it's an astounding time, you know. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, Tim, thank you so much for the opportunity to talk and boy, there's so many more things I'd love to cover, and maybe we'll have you come back again 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>Sometime. Yeah, well, thank you. I, I, you know, I, I could talk to you all day, so we should just go on a 12 hour flight somewhere. Yeah. Really. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And <span style="color:red" data-ts="3739.02" data-end_ts="3739.26" title="3739.02" id=c_"3739.02">__then__</span> be sick of each other, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3740.32" data-end_ts="3740.54" title="3740.32" id=c_"3740.32">__but__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>Jesus, I'm off the plane. Oh my God. So, but, but, yeah, I always say that, you know, like, oh my God, like that person, like, can't you sit next to them on a ride to <span style="color:red" data-ts="3749.45" data-end_ts="3749.74" title="3749.45" id=c_"3749.45">__deli__</span> or something <laugh>. So yeah, I always, I always love, talking with you. It's always, yeah. Mind opening for me. So thanks a lot for the opportunity to, to, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>To have conversation. Thank you so much. And, yeah, we'll, we'll plan on getting together again soon. Okay, great. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3765.98" data-end_ts="3766.18" title="3765.98" id=c_"3765.98">__Any__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3766.18" data-end_ts="3766.3" title="3766.18" id=c_"3766.18">__time__</span>. Have a great day, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Timothy: </b>Man. Okay, thanks. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So there you have it. Thanks to Tim for, spending some time talking smart with me. It's always a <span style="color:red" data-ts="3778.1" data-end_ts="3778.3" title="3778.1" id=c_"3778.1">__who__</span> to talk to him, but, I always find out new stuff about Tim as well. And again, I'm always seem to be pushed by the examples that he sets. If you're interested in finding out more about Tim and his work, you can check out, his overview@wwwprimamaterial.org or to get a dossier T Weaver, that's T W E A V e r dot biotika, b i o t i c a.org. I'll have links up on the podcast website if you need to check it out. Otherwise, thanks again for listening for another week. Thanks, to all the people out there that make it possible to do this podcast, particularly my employer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_%2774">Cycling '74</a> who is incredibly embracing of my work, doing this. And, for, in this case, for the folks at Du in particular, Tim, himself, for not only, doing the interview, but for helping me become the artist I've become. So thanks for listening and I hope to talk to you again. I don't hope I'll just talk to you next week. Bye.
