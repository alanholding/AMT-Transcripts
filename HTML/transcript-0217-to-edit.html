<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today I have quite a special guest, one of the International Mystery Men of Music here. We are going to be talking to Search <span style="color:red" data-ts="25.605" data-end_ts="25.845" title="25.605" id=c_"25.605">__High__</span>. I mean, if you are listening to my podcast, you know who the sky is. So there we go. You 
</p>

<p>
<b>Surachai: </b>Know, it took 220 episodes to get to me, so That's right. Real honor to be on here. <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Top of the list, man. So with that, I will say hi to search. <span style="color:red" data-ts="41.725" data-end_ts="41.925" title="41.725" id=c_"41.725">__Hi__</span>. Hey man. How's it going? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Surachai: </b>Good, man. I'm just joking, by the way. I'm gonna give you a hard time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that's good. I, I need a hard time. So for people who, aren't familiar with you, first of all, shame on them, but secondly, why don't you give us a quick rundown of how you at least like to, posit your existence? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Surachai: </b>I've never been asked that, so I'm very uncomfortable with this question. I don't know how people know me. I don't know how I should project myself. So I generally don't. I just do things and that includes releasing music, hosting events, and just working. And that's basically it. I don't define myself other than that. I just do things, you know. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That's, that's cool. But it also seems to like fly in the face of like modern society. I mean, how, how can you be a human and not want to take selfies and like, you know, post your, your buttocks on Instagram for everyone to understand <span style="color:red" data-ts="101.565" data-end_ts="101.725" title="101.565" id=c_"101.565">__people__</span>? Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Surachai: </b>Those are different accounts. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Surachai: </b><laugh>, there's one that you have to pay for. <span style="color:red" data-ts="107.155" data-end_ts="107.445" title="107.155" id=c_"107.155">__Yeah__</span>, there you go. I exist on a social media platform. I might not respond to anything, but you know, I'm putting things out there for sure of the things I'm doing, the people I'm with, and it's a, it's a look inside of my daily life for sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>For people who just sort of like, do a quick internet surf, what they'll see first off is that you are involved in the Trash Audio collective. That's one of the things that just like pops right up to the top of Google Land. Why don't you talk a little bit about what trash audio is about? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Surachai: </b>Right. It's kind of been dormant because we actually are busy. So Trash audio started with Justin McGrath and I, and we were both in Chicago and we kind of just started interviewing friends, about their studios. And we called it Workspace and Environment. And we were just interested to see how, you know, the ergonomics and the, the workflow of our immediate friends, how they worked from that. We recruited Richard Devine, who's just been an old friend. And then from that we recruited Alessandro Cortini, who's an old friend now too. And then our last member, Mo Espinoza was just added, I don't know, a couple years ago just because we hang out with this fucking guy all the time, <laugh>. And it's just like, dude, just, I'm just gonna add you to this site and you know, nothing, nothing's gonna change. You're not gonna get emails or anything. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Surachai: </b>It's just now you're known as a fucking asshole with the rest of us <laugh>. So congratulations. And then we started doing events and these events started at Justin's place in downtown Chicago where it was just like his studio and then a few people coming in. And then someone brought up Ula. This was when ULAs were unobtainable. Like we, we didn't even know where to get them. Funny story. Like, so like the <span style="color:red" data-ts="215.555" data-end_ts="215.845" title="215.555" id=c_"215.555">__maer__</span> scene didn't really exist at that point. It was only do fer and analog systems. And we had these events and then as events were happening, all these manufacturers started popping up and we kept inviting <span style="color:red" data-ts="227.485" data-end_ts="227.685" title="227.485" id=c_"227.485">__them__</span>. We could house all the manufacturers that were new that were not do fer 'cause he's from Germany and that were not analog systems. And it started out kind of with Harvest Man, tiptop audio and make noise. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Surachai: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> like right up front and then live wire. And then it just expanded to a point where we're just like, we cannot have all these people because it's just too much. And that was like six, seven years into it. Yeah. And now it's just like, Jesus Christ, you look at the list, it's probably over 60 or something like that. <laugh>. I know all those dudes on a personal level. I don't know what they're making anymore. And I don't know what's going on really in their world. You know, if I travel to their city, I say, what's up? I go in their house, I eat their food, I sleep on their couch. We don't really talk about gear that much anymore. You know, it's like these people have become our family. Right. Yeah. And and that's kind of the way I approach things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Surachai: </b>Like when we hang out with a bunch of like-minded people, we rarely talk about our work. We have to connect on a personal level before anything kind of goes beyond that. Trash audio basically just became a place where we can post whatever the hell we wanted without pressure of like news, like, what's new? What's everybody using? It's just like, no, what are we using? Like we are five people that are supported by the audio industry in one way. Musician, sound designer, dj, you know, studio tech. You read other websites and they're just telling you what people are using. And then they have paid blurbs from people that are using that instrument for that split second until they go back to their gear. You know what I'm saying? It's just like, I use some really boring shit every day and I use some amazing, interesting shit every day. It's rare to get a, a truthful account of what that list is. If you're just going to whatever website you go to to read about music. We just do what whatever we need to do to keep ourselves entertained because it is a grim, polluted world out there of information. Mostly we try to keep it light and the thing we all have in common really strongly is a sense of humor. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, good thing. It's interesting you you say that about the gear because I think, you know, given the names of some of the people that are, that are part of this crew, it's one's first impression would be like, oh, they probably just sit around and talk about the newest shit all the time. But I think, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Surachai: </b>Oh, we do <laugh>, we do, it's just a lot of things don't stick on the wall. You know, it's like, I hate to do this, but like, you know, when when a new instrument comes out, everybody gets really excited about it and then everybody starts using it and then everybody starts sounding the same. And then it's like this trend, you know, when all those tr 8 0 8 clones and 9 0 9 clones came out for months, it was just like, oh cool man, you got it There it is a fucking video of you going through it and comparing it. It's like, guess what? It's not gonna sound like it. And who caress? That's a good thing. It's its own thing. If you want to 8 0 8, buy an 8 0 8. If you want something that sounds like that digital thing, buy that thing. Just use what is gonna work for you, man. This whole thing of authenticity and trendy and things like that, I don't know. They don't really go hand in hand. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's, it's interesting you say that because one of the things that I think is, is often overlooked is this idea of something that is mundane but actually can become part of part of your own voice. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Surachai: </b>Gimme an example. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I have always used an <span style="color:red" data-ts="439.145" data-end_ts="439.365" title="439.145" id=c_"439.145">__AKA__</span> MPC. It's the kind of, it's not the kind of thing where when I go hang out with people and they're like, oh, what do you use? They don't wanna hear me say, an MPC from 2001. Sure. You know, what they really wanted to hear is like, what's the newest granular widget that I've got wedged into my system? And you know, the fact of the matter is, I don't got one. Sorry. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Surachai: </b>Richard has it <laugh> <span style="color:red" data-ts="463.505" data-end_ts="463.725" title="463.505" id=c_"463.505">__Yes__</span>, does. And he actually uses it, but I don't have time to like figure that shit out 'cause I'm out working a lot. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So for you, you say that you're, you're out working a lot. What does outworking mean 
</p>

<p>
<b>Surachai: </b>By trade? I am a sound designer and location audio person generally, but realistically I do everything from pre-production to mastering. All right, let's just think of the elements of sound that composes, let's say, I don't know, a commercial or a trailer or whatever, right? So you have to be on location, you have to sit around or stand around with your hands in the air with a boom mic to get the dialogue or whatever you're recording animals or whatever the hell you bring that audio back, you dump it, you give it to the editors, they piece it together, they send it back to you, you mix it, it gets worked back and forth for many revisions. You find out if it's for the web, it's for tv, is it for the movie theater. If it's for an app and then you level it accordingly, you master it accordingly and it goes out the door and hopefully you never see it again. <laugh>, right? By trade. That is more or less what I do. I've been working with a few companies that focus on trailers, you know, I do sound design, things like that. Generally speaking, I am either on location or I'm in like a studio or I'm just in front of a computer. So that's my job. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, one of the things that I find is that people, I mean, whether it's on the technical side or on the creative side or whatever, people who have jobs that involve working on sound, it ends up sort of like curing them of wanting to do it creatively or artistically as well. You know, it's almost like, it's almost like, you know, if you have to, if you have to use a hole all day, the last thing you wanna do is come home and do gardening. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Surachai: </b>For sure. And I think if you look at the studios people have in their homes versus the studios they work in, you're gonna notice a contrast. That's why I have a modular at home. 'cause you know, you don't want to click all day and shit, and I wanna get away from menus and I want to get away from just intricate programming and just plug things in and get stuff going immediately. Whereas, you know, at work, I'm just working on this one file, cleaning it up on isotope and just trying to make it sound like the other file. You know, it's like you're working either, I mean, you're always working creatively, but you're either working towards a goal that you didn't set or Mm-hmm. <affirmative> one that you did set. Right. And, you have to have a creative solution for both. But one of 'em, obviously you care more about or you're, you'll like do some experimentation because, you know, if you're working for someone, you're gonna be like, okay, this works and this has worked, so I'm gonna do that. When you're by yourself, it's just whatever works, whatever, I feel like whatever I want. So it's, I guess that's a control element. But, you know, the high powered CEO is getting dominated by a dominatrix and then, you know, the, the quiet sub dude is like going home and destroying something. You kind of have the counterpart, you know, you gotta get the full spectrum because people are not one dimensional. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Right. Now I got a chance to see you perform, at the 2017 black noise thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Surachai: </b>Oh, sorry, we don't do refunds, man. I'm sorry. <laugh>. You're gonna have to get through another channel if you want your money back. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh. But it was, it was really interesting and, and actually when, when we started, you know, when we started our conversation, I I just assumed you were one of the LA dudes, right? I didn't realize that you were based out of Sure. I just made the assumption that you were there, especially since, as part of your performance, you did this, amazing like video piece in the background. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Surachai: </b>I mean that black noise, what we try to do is incorporate a lot of visuals. So everybody had visuals, uhhuh, <affirmative>, you know, different types for different personalities and different types of music. You know, I'm trying to evoke an emotion or, draw 'em <span style="color:red" data-ts="709.285" data-end_ts="709.325" title="709.285" id=c_"709.285">__in__</span> with like a story or gain their attention in an emotional level rather than just, this shit is awesome, you know? Yeah. I want a little more than hear <span style="color:red" data-ts="719.205" data-end_ts="719.325" title="719.205" id=c_"719.205">__a__</span> sound, see a visual. I set out to do that, by shooting a video and working with two artists that I really admire visually. Simona <span style="color:red" data-ts="728.895" data-end_ts="729.245" title="728.895" id=c_"728.895">__Noric__</span>, who I'm saying <span style="color:red" data-ts="729.885" data-end_ts="730.085" title="729.885" id=c_"729.885">__her__</span> name wrong, and Rachel Palmer who helped with visuals. You know, I wanted to engage people more than just like, okay, this sounds good and this looks good. I wanted, I don't know, I wanted people to kind of feel something. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it was a, it was a shocking to me, it was sort of like a shocking thing. I was not expecting that and I was just mesmerized by it. It was, it, I mean, first of all, it was beautiful. It looked like it was done with <span style="color:red" data-ts="755.885" data-end_ts="756.005" title="755.885" id=c_"755.885">__a__</span>, like a real high speed camera or something. Definitely. And a very high definition because the level of detail was just jaw dropping. But also it's not the kind of thing you expect at a gig. I mean, and talk about emotional. Yeah. That's, that's what it was. It, it, it made it so that all of a sudden there's a section of the gig that broke me down because I was there and I was like intellectually getting into what Richard was doing, and I was like, it's a interpolation of his old work in his new work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And, you know, it came off, you know, my, my robot head starts like kicking in and then all of a sudden you come out and there's this beautiful flowing robe cape kind of thing. And I just, it, it just broke me down and, and it was a stunning thing to experience during a gig. I, I just wanted to, you know, I wanted to actually point that out and I think that you might have like an online version of that. I, I thought that that was stunning. And I, I wanted to hear a little bit about why you chose to go that direction, because everybody else was doing sort of like, you know, the, the high impact tech-driven visuals and this, it was just such a breakdown. It was, it was fabulous. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Surachai: </b>First of off. Thank you. It really means a lot. It's flattering and I don't really get to talk about my work with people very much because I hate compliments and I hate attention. So it's making me sweat. When you say that, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>At the very least we talk about its effectiveness, it was damn effective. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Surachai: </b>I work with a team of brilliant 3D artists and after effect artists and Photoshops and editors, because I work in a post place that has sound and visuals just jammed into a basement somewhere. <laugh> the creative idea behind it was let's shoot this thing and I'm gonna compose music to it and then I'm gonna find a way to integrate this into a live set. It's been effective in the sense that people, I don't know, come up to me after and they have an emotional response. It's interesting because Richard and I play a lot together, and like you said, he's very angular, very intellectual, like Mm-Hmm <affirmative>, my brain is trying to wrap around what sounds are coming out of his system, whereas I'm trying to envelop you into my world and let me just show you something beautiful real quick and see how you feel about that. It's worked really well. I think between him and I, I call it the, the Asian one, two punch <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, it's quite a juxtaposition, that's for sure. Right. One of the things that I kind of focus on in this podcast is kind of people's beginning story or their background and, I'm not sure how much you even want to share about it, but you're 
</p>

<p>
<b>Surachai: </b>A kid in high school, you save up for a drum machine, it sucks. You go to the next one, you learn, you learn one thing at a time, and then you just end up making music, you know? I don't know, it, it's just something I've been doing since I was a kid and I'm just lucky enough to keep having an interest in it and do it and then get paid to do it. The story itself, I don't know if there's like a specific question I'd answer it, but, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, yeah. So let me pose one. At some point you went from a guy who wanted to do it to guy who's a professional doing it, that requires some sort of a big break, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Surachai: </b>Let me stop you right there. Okay. Because I'm still a guy that wants to do it, and that's still who I think of myself as I see. So the professional word that you attach to it is, yes, I'm getting paid for it and I'm lucky to get paid for it, but I would probably still be doing this if I didn't get paid for it or if I got paid for it at unsustainable levels, I would like make it work in some level, you know what I'm saying? So it's sure it's like a privilege and I'm so lucky to know what I have wanted to do for so long and then to sustain myself with it. And, you know, that's kind of all of trash audio. It's like, what else would we be doing if we weren't doing this? We would be fucked, man. Like <laugh>, I'm not gonna speak for them, but, you know, I hate people and I hate attention and I hate compliments. So it's like a, a very antisocial person. <laugh>, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, but you, you posit yourself as a, as a antisocial person, except everybody kind of knows you, you're friends with everybody. It doesn't, it doesn't come off like an anti, you're using 
</p>

<p>
<b>Surachai: </b>The F word really liberally <laugh>. Just because people know you doesn't, that's a one-sided thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1038.985" data-end_ts="1039.205" title="1038.985" id=c_"1038.985">__Oh__</span>. But they don't invite you to their house share food or give you a place to stay <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Surachai: </b>I actually really cherish my, my relationships with people. But you know, it's not like I like everybody. Yeah, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1051.005" data-end_ts="1051.245" title="1051.005" id=c_"1051.005">__okay__</span>. Or I get along with everybody and that's fine. You know, like the other guys in trash audio have a way higher tolerance and patience for people. And Richard is just like the best, you know, like if someone, he <span style="color:red" data-ts="1064.245" data-end_ts="1064.405" title="1064.245" id=c_"1064.245">__wants__</span>, he's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1064.525" data-end_ts="1064.605" title="1064.525" id=c_"1064.525">__A__</span> people person. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Surachai: </b>Oh dude. Like if I'm walking around with him and someone wants to come talk to me, I'm like, here is a more famous Asian person you can talk to. And I just fucking back away bail, <laugh> bail and just find some coffee or something, you know, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. Well, so doesn't that ever get in the way of you doing what you want to do? What 
</p>

<p>
<b>Surachai: </b>Do I wanna do? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I don't know. You tell me. It, it seems like you kind of want to do everything. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Surachai: </b>Yeah, I mean, I guess I am doing everything and that's the benefit of living where I do. I can do it without distraction. When I'm in LA I'm around a lot of people and I rarely get work done unless it's like a meeting or like a very designated time. But that's why I come back here, Chicago and I could just p things out. I output a fair amount of music and I'm able to do that because like you, I have solitude and isolation and not too many distractions. Not that I don't have a problem with saying no to people, especially if they wanna do something social. Like I use the word antisocial, not because I avoid people and I'm like, in <span style="color:red" data-ts="1130.045" data-end_ts="1130.525" title="1130.045" id=c_"1130.045">__introvert__</span>, I actually have a lot of antisocial tendencies and like I'm confrontational and I'm like, not, I'm not a good person in a crowd. I'm good like with small groups, but in a crowd I will either shut down or just get like hostile because I don't like group mentality. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1147.035" data-end_ts="1147.325" title="1147.035" id=c_"1147.035">__Yeah__</span>. We, that's another, another podcast. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But no, it's actually not because you hit on something that makes my teeth hurt because it's so familiar, but I've never really been able to talk to anybody about it because it, it hasn't made sense because there's like, how is it possible that I can desire to be, to perform for people and not want to be around them? Sure. Or not want to be part of the crowd? Why is it that even when I go to a gig, and as much as I enjoy that the black noise gig, it was also sort of like, by the end of it, I had had enough of being around other people and then all of a sudden I start worrying about like, oh, look how everybody's like slavishly pointing them their noses towards the stage and stuff. I start like building up this like set to defeat my ability to enjoy even being there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Surachai: </b>For sure. Like if you go to those shows, you are gonna find me 99% of the time at the march place because that is the one place people do not like to go to because I'm trying to take your money <laugh>, you <span style="color:red" data-ts="1212.805" data-end_ts="1212.925" title="1212.805" id=c_"1212.805">__know__</span>, I'm either there. It's a, that's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>A great strategy actually. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Surachai: </b>Man, <laugh>, yeah, I'm either back there setting up, helping someone else set up whatever. I don't like going to places where I don't have a role when I'm with like-minded people that are going after what they wanna do that have taken risks, that have pursued a calling. Yeah. I get down with that. I'll come over, let's talk. Right. But if it's like, God <span style="color:red" data-ts="1243.965" data-end_ts="1244.165" title="1243.965" id=c_"1243.965">__damn__</span>, if <span style="color:red" data-ts="1244.525" data-end_ts="1244.645" title="1244.525" id=c_"1244.525">__I__</span>, first off, I don't drink, so that is another big thing, you know, like, I'm not gonna meet you at a bar. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right.

<p>
<b>Surachai: </b>My problem is I don't find purpose in a lot of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1254.605" data-end_ts="1254.765" title="1254.605" id=c_"1254.605">__things__</span>. And, and also like small talk, so that's like a big thing with big groups too that I don't like. And I, I like to engage. I like asking questions. I like knowing who I'm talking to. I like finding the background and seeing if I could be helpful, but in a big setting, it's just like, Hey man, how's it going? You know, how are X, Y, Z? All right, cool, great food. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1278.025" data-end_ts="1278.245" title="1278.025" id=c_"1278.025">__Nah__</span>, you know, Jesus Christ fucking kill me. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I, I swear, man, there are a lot of people that, that struggle with this kind of thing and 
</p>

<p>
<b>Surachai: </b>It's not a struggle if all the people you hang out, with are like this. I don't know. It's just like the next time you're in a group right. And they all decide to do something and you don't want to do it, are you <span style="color:red" data-ts="1303.685" data-end_ts="1303.885" title="1303.685" id=c_"1303.685">__going__</span> to do it or are you gonna be like, I'm breaking off? And I think a lot of people go through their lives just doing it. Right. Me, I'm more than happy to break off. Like, <laugh> time alone to me is time well spent. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's, it's interesting because, you know, I have done a lot of these interviews and, and I've never really talked to anybody about this site. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Surachai: </b>You know, you gotta know who you are and you gotta know what you want to do. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="1329.525" data-end_ts="1329.685" title="1329.525" id=c_"1329.525">__it__</span>, I think it reflects the music in the end, or anything you do, Tony, from Make Noise. It was either Tony or Kelly. We were walking in Asheville. They said, search how your, your body language is really intimidating. I'm like, what are you talking? I'm literally just walking just like, dude, it's just really severe. And I remember that. I'm like, what does that mean? You know what, I'm gonna embrace that because a lot of the things I do is severe. The commitment is there. The things I do are very black and white. Some people might have the idea that I have things figured out, but I don't. It's just things I need to do my way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>One of the things I get about all the things that you've talked about over the course of this whole discussion is like this mind bending level of commitment that you put into things. It seems like when you talk about the things that you've done, in every case it's been at a level of commitment that most people would just not put into something. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Surachai: </b>I don't know. I, I can't talk for what other people consider commitment or not. So I don't know. I don't know if I can agree with that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, but I wonder if that's what you're hearing when you're hearing what you consider shitty music is. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Surachai: </b>I don't know. I think people just need to be more blunt and honest and just, take a risk. Because a lot of the things I'm hearing, it's like an echo chamber. You just keep hearing it until it dies out and then it's gone and then what's the next thing? Yeah. All right. That thing makes that sound. Let's just fucking pound it out until everybody's sick of hearing it, then it's gone. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But do you think that some of that might be just because people abandon it too quickly? I mean the TB 3 0 3, you know, it yeah, it had to be misused, but it also had to be people had to stick with that. People had to hear that, be excited by it and then stick with it for long enough for the genre to exist. I mean, in a way we're in such a disposable economy with some of this kind of stuff that it just, it doesn't get an opportunity to develop into anything. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Surachai: </b>I think you're, you have a really valid point there. It's just like, cool, these instruments exist, you know, they're just these finite ideas in a box and then it's just, alright, well how much commitment do you wanna put into this? How much do you wanna try to break this thing? How much do you want to get your voice out from this thing rather than its voice out from the box, you know? Right, right. And I think that is more valid than what I'm saying is just like the new thing comes out, people just use it and then it's gone. I think it's, people don't use it enough. Maybe, you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Know, again, getting back to sort of like your level of commitment to stuff, and one of the things that, that I always find disconcerting is the sense that some of this instrumentation or some of the use of these things, it just isn't even around long enough to, to get facility with it, let alone virtuosity. Right. Now, is it, is it just like foolish of me to think that virtuosity should even be a thing? I don't know. I mean, in some cases, you know, certainly I see people who've, who've become virtuosos <span style="color:red" data-ts="1508.965" data-end_ts="1509.125" title="1508.965" id=c_"1508.965">__in__</span> software. Now maybe that just means being a really great operator of a thing. I don't know. . But 
</p>

<p>
<b>Surachai: </b>It depends on the definition that you're trying to use. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, I guess it does, but I mean, you sound like a person who kind of focuses on like, at least mastery of the stuff that you work with. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Surachai: </b>Sure. I mean, like a lot of my ALS are kind of focused around a central piece of gear. Like for instance, ritual was used completely with the Wayman S one, MK two mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and Instinctive Memory had a big focus on compressors, primarily the L one, micro compressor. And it's every single album I have, it's got an accompanying, post on it on trash audio. Right. I have no secrets and I say that in a way to encourage people to do what I'm doing so I don't have to do it anymore and I can move on to the next thing. <laugh>, it's just to further advance, you know, sound. I'm gonna speak generally here, but I think a very, very positive trait in an artist or anyone who's doing anything creative is obsessiveness because very rarely I would say things get found out on a surface superficial level. If you're dealing with something with 30 knobs that all interplay with each other, yeah. You could probably get some interesting places not knowing what you're doing 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>In drive by mode <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Surachai: </b>Right. You know, just, you have no control, you'll get what you get. But if you start understanding how these things are playing with each other, you have 30 knobs that play with each other, you'll get a lot of results. Especially if you're aiming towards those results and you're, you know, what you're getting. Not saying I'm a master of the showman at all because I, I'm actually looking at it right now and despite making almost two albums with it, I'm still, I still don't know where to begin when I look at it. I lost my train of thought just by looking at it. <laugh>. That's how, that's how <span style="color:red" data-ts="1628.225" data-end_ts="1628.445" title="1628.225" id=c_"1628.225">__lot__</span>, like, that's how like enamored and like confused. I am 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Engrossing. It is. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Surachai: </b>Yeah. Yeah. But like if I needed to conjure something up from it, baseline, high hats, whatever is missing or whatever needs to be added, I know how to get there. And if you just have surface level understanding of it, you can get there. But I think very rarely are you gonna be able to get your personality to speak Yeah. In that getting there, you know what I'm saying? Like, people can get where they need to get, but very rarely are you getting a spin on it or you're getting a voice out of it or you're getting a characteristic or a personality out of it. And that's where I think obsessiveness is very important because if you don't have that trait, you're just gonna be twiddling shit and happy with what you get. Right. You know what I'm saying? Right. Opposed to like really digging in and just being fucking pissed that you're not getting where you need to be and like really grinding and you know, it doesn't have to be like that for every fucking thing you have. Trust me. Like there's things I use pretty simply like compressors, you know, you know, you know what you're getting with that, but like sound sources and things like that you kind of gotta dig into. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>While you were, while you were talking about that, one of the things that made me realize is that I have like, I have like an allergy <laugh> sometimes to things that sound too pretty except then not why is it sometimes do I find it dis disgusting or not enjoyable and other times it draws me right in. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Surachai: </b>Is it an identical sound? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It can be. Yeah. I mean it's like, oh man, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Surachai: </b>That's totally where you are then in life. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well it's like a right, it's like, you know, a sequenced sh 1 0 1 blip. Right. Sometimes I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1735.805" data-end_ts="1735.925" title="1735.805" id=c_"1735.805">__could__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1735.925" data-end_ts="1736.045" title="1735.925" id=c_"1735.925">__be__</span> like, oh God, if I ever hear that again, I'm gonna just want to eat a gun. Right. As you were talking about this, I realized that maybe what it is is it's, it's not the prettiness of it or it's not even the tamber or anything, but it's sort of the, the fact that somebody that, that their voice came out in that in context, in a way that speaks. And so all of a sudden it's not that thing, it's the context around it and it's the, the way that the table was set by the person who was working it out. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Surachai: </b>Let me ask you this, my answer on this changes quite often. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1770.515" data-end_ts="1770.805" title="1770.515" id=c_"1770.515">__Okay__</span>. But let's just say you hated something, like you hated this piece of music, but you read something, I don't know what it is that makes you sympathetic or open to it. Would that actually change your opinion on it to actually like it? Or would you just be at kind of arms length? Like, I respect it because the guy who made it is X, y, z? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I don't know. I, you know, it's like, I would make an analogy sometimes when you first meet a group of people, there'll be one person that stands out that you just really kind of don't like. And a lot of times if you get to know those people over a long period of time, that's the person that ends up becoming your best friend. Right? Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Surachai: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, I mean, there are cases where there are things that initially I really don't like and, and eventually come back to be a personal favorite for whatever reason. And I'm sure that there's a different reason for each 
</p>

<p>
<b>Surachai: </b>Equivalent. So, you know what I'm actually realizing as you're saying that, that I'm asking if you have an emotional response to something, is that emotion able to be, forged into another emotion? And the answer I would think is like emotion plus time equals different emotion. Right? So Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I guess <span style="color:red" data-ts="1846.605" data-end_ts="1846.725" title="1846.605" id=c_"1846.605">__if__</span> we're just answering this ourselves, but like if the worst thing you can do is just have no reaction or just feel nothing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Right. Exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Surachai: </b>'cause at that point you're gonna have to be really convinced to feel something. Right. Like if you feel disgusted, you know, we can flip that <laugh> if you love something. Oh, we can work on that too. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>If you feel nothing <span style="color:red" data-ts="1868.325" data-end_ts="1868.525" title="1868.325" id=c_"1868.325">__where__</span> if 
</p>

<p>
<b>Surachai: </b>You feel nothing, you're in trouble. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Indeed. Good point. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1871.985" data-end_ts="1872.205" title="1871.985" id=c_"1871.985">__All__</span> right, so, thanks so much for taking the time. I mean, we were kinda like shooting all over the map. It was, it was really interesting and a little intimidating in a way because we were talking. Tell 
</p>

<p>
<b>Surachai: </b>Me how 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, just, here's one of the things I would say is you don't follow, you don't follow the typical script. Most times when I have an interview with somebody and, and I start talking about them, people don't have an opportunity to talk about themselves enough. And so they enjoy the opportunity to do so. You seem to actively not enjoy that opportunity. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Surachai: </b>Yeah. You are correct. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, hey, thanks for the time but I am going to make a point of like cornering you in person sometime. I won't touch you, but, we will continue, continue our discussion For sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Surachai: </b>You act like I wouldn't like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I don't know 
</p>

<p>
<b>Surachai: </b><laugh>, as long as you're not with like 50 people. I'm good man. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1923.205" data-end_ts="1923.485" title="1923.205" id=c_"1923.205">__You're__</span> good. We could go do whatever you need to do. <laugh>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1925.245" data-end_ts="1925.605" title="1925.245" id=c_"1925.245">__Alright__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Man. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1926.465" data-end_ts="1926.685" title="1926.465" id=c_"1926.465">__All__</span> right, well, we'll talk again soon. All 
</p>

<p>
<b>Surachai: </b>Right, see <span style="color:red" data-ts="1929.125" data-end_ts="1929.245" title="1929.125" id=c_"1929.125">__you__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nobody: </b><i>78. </i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>There you go. That's Sir <span style="color:red" data-ts="1939.575" data-end_ts="1939.925" title="1939.575" id=c_"1939.575">__Chian__</span> all of his full tilt boogie mode. Thanks to him for not only sitting for the interview, but for actually doing the edit up on this one. Really appreciate it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thanks to you for listening. I really appreciate having you here again this week. If you could do me a favor, run over to Facebook to the art music technology page, or if you get this through iTunes, go to the iTunes page and just give it a like, or a thumbs up or whatever the hell they want, just to make sure that we end up bubbling up the surface on searches occasionally. That'll really help the podcast a lot and introduce this to a few more people. Thanks so much and we will catch you next time.
