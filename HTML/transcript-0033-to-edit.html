<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. This week, we're meeting with a very special guest. He's someone that's come up in a number of our podcasts already, particularly anyone who spent time around, mills college. His name is Les <span style="color:red" data-ts="20.24" data-end_ts="20.59" title="20.24" id=c_"20.24">__stuck__</span>. He is a coworker with me at cycling. He's helped out a lot with educational tools and, videos about working with max and stuff like that. He also works at mills and where he's come up in the past is that he's actually introduced a lot of people to new ways about thinking about how to do their art. And it makes a lot of sense because if you look into Les's background, he is truly a multidisciplinary. He is the multimedia guy. He works in, music and sound. He does a lot of visual work. He works with a lot of different kinds of performers and really does a lot of interesting work in a lot of different disciplines. So, hi, Les, how are you doing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les Stuck: </b>Hey, Dar. I'm doing pretty well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thanks here 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>In Oakland. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm sorry. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>I said summer's here in Oakland. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, good for you. I'm up in the mountains here in the Rocky mountains and, just today, our last bit of snow disappeared, but we've, we're also in the middle of this thing where we <span style="color:red" data-ts="95.95" data-end_ts="96.07" title="95.95" id=c_"95.95">__get__</span> we've had like hail four days in a row. So I don't know what that, what that bodes for the summer, but it doesn't seem very good. <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>No, no. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So I'd like to start off by having you, talk a little bit about your background. You, I kind of gave the quick explanation of, of what you do, but I think it'd be really interesting for someone who is able to sort of like interact with a lot of different media. I think it'd be really interesting to hear a little bit about your background. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>Well, I'd say <span style="color:red" data-ts="131.43" data-end_ts="131.51" title="131.43" id=c_"131.43">__I__</span> start out as a musician and then, like playing blues, harmonic and, and electric <span style="color:red" data-ts="136.79" data-end_ts="137.03" title="136.79" id=c_"136.79">__bass__</span> and whatever. And just being, being attracted to technology and sort of quickly became a recording engineer, moved to San Francisco and started working <span style="color:red" data-ts="148.51" data-end_ts="148.79" title="148.51" id=c_"148.51">__hide__</span> studios, recording a bunch of punk bands and in the eighties. And I kind of, even back then, I kind of <span style="color:red" data-ts="159.95" data-end_ts="160.07" title="159.95" id=c_"159.95">__like__</span> developed a taste for really unusual music, weird ways of making music and also, trying not to be a slave to the technology. You're trying to think of, you know, making technology work for the art, whatever, or the quote art unquote. So, then I started, I got a gig with the San Francisco ballet, doing like hardware sampler and 24 track analog music for dance for this composer from Europe, Tom Mullens. And, he was doing a piece for <span style="color:red" data-ts="196.64" data-end_ts="196.84" title="196.64" id=c_"196.64">__William__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="196.84" data-end_ts="196.92" title="196.84" id=c_"196.84">__win__</span> foresight and that kind of got me on their coattails. And suddenly I found myself in, in Frankfurt, Germany, doing theater sound essentially, and some studio work for ballet became a sound engineer with SSO, <span style="color:red" data-ts="211.72" data-end_ts="211.92" title="211.72" id=c_"211.72">__more__</span> Darren and Frankfurt, got acquainted with max 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>And, started making little algorithmic compositions. And just the fact that I was hanging out with this dance company and living with one of their dancers and, and doing their sound and stuff, I started naturally getting involved in making music for dance and it only sort of sense. So I just really got into that sort of thing. I started learning max, I bought it from op code and somebody taught me how to crack it. I could like crack any copy of any <span style="color:red" data-ts="246.16" data-end_ts="246.32" title="246.16" id=c_"246.16">__op__</span> code product. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>And it was a really scary crack <span style="color:red" data-ts="251.18" data-end_ts="251.4" title="251.18" id=c_"251.18">__cuz__</span> it wasn't, you know, like let's do this in this sandbox and I'll send <span style="color:red" data-ts="255.2" data-end_ts="255.32" title="255.2" id=c_"255.2">__her__</span> off, tell my friends spelled <span style="color:red" data-ts="257.24" data-end_ts="257.36" title="257.24" id=c_"257.24">__to__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="257.36" data-end_ts="257.48" title="257.36" id=c_"257.36">__the__</span> Z, but it was like, we had to actually go into the computer and write on a particular spot on the disc in hex and hope that you didn't completely destroy everything, you know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b><laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>So, I was doing a gig for a piece, by <span style="color:red" data-ts="272.66" data-end_ts="272.88" title="272.66" id=c_"272.66">__KA__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="273.24" data-end_ts="273.6" title="273.24" id=c_"273.24">__<inaudible>__</span> for the <span style="color:red" data-ts="273.96" data-end_ts="274.2" title="273.96" id=c_"273.96">__info__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="274.2" data-end_ts="274.4" title="274.2" id=c_"274.2">__modern__</span> and <span style="color:red" data-ts="276.52" data-end_ts="276.72" title="276.52" id=c_"276.52">__ol__</span> NEK who's artistic director for <span style="color:red" data-ts="279.48" data-end_ts="279.72" title="279.48" id=c_"279.48">__<inaudible>__</span> happened to attend and invited me to come visit. So I just, they just let me play around in the, pedagogy department for a week. And I said, Hey, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="291.99" data-end_ts="292.28" title="291.99" id=c_"291.99">__your__</span> guy's version of max is kind of out of date. I'll install the latest version on all your computers if you want. And after did that, they offered me a job 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b><laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>So, I don't know that's, that's how I got in there. But, the interesting thing about working for ear <span style="color:red" data-ts="310.6" data-end_ts="310.76" title="310.6" id=c_"310.6">__come__</span> is all of a sudden they were <span style="color:red" data-ts="311.6" data-end_ts="311.72" title="311.6" id=c_"311.6">__wearing__</span> this audio version of max, which, you know, eventually became MSP or something like that. And so, I found out I was able to use my sound engineering skills in this new version of max. And, also, so in cycling <span style="color:red" data-ts="329.92" data-end_ts="330.2" title="329.92" id=c_"329.92">__70__</span>, before came into existence with this audio <span style="color:red" data-ts="333.5" data-end_ts="333.72" title="333.5" id=c_"333.5">__max__</span> software, I was one of the few people who was out of a job who, knew <span style="color:red" data-ts="341.36" data-end_ts="341.52" title="341.36" id=c_"341.36">__how__</span> to do this stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>So right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="343.7" data-end_ts="343.92" title="343.7" id=c_"343.7">__You__</span> get hired. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>Yeah, you know, the, the whole time I've been working with all kinds of different technology, a lot of different types of recording devices and samples and so forth. And there've been times where I tried to build a complete, you know, max universe that would make every sound that I could imagine those things going for a few years and they crash horribly or something. But, I did, there <span style="color:red" data-ts="375.4" data-end_ts="375.48" title="375.4" id=c_"375.4">__were__</span> a bunch of algorithmic stuff where you would make these, this sort of total polyrhythmic where there's no way to count bars or anything, but it just keeps moving forward. And that became really useful for dancers because no matter how you count their music, they're gonna count it differently. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="394.38" data-end_ts="394.6" title="394.38" id=c_"394.38">__Let__</span> 'em, don't even worry about how it counts out. And then at <span style="color:red" data-ts="402.76" data-end_ts="402.96" title="402.76" id=c_"402.76">__your__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="402.96" data-end_ts="403.16" title="402.96" id=c_"402.96">__time__</span> I learned, a lot about spatialization and ring modulators and you know, score following. Yeah, it was, was, <span style="color:red" data-ts="416.71" data-end_ts="417" title="416.71" id=c_"416.71">__it's__</span> a great learning experience. Then, then finally I, got this job as a technical director at <span style="color:red" data-ts="422.76" data-end_ts="422.96" title="422.76" id=c_"422.76">__middle__</span> college. And that's where I began doing a lot of teaching. So, and most of my teaching has been one to one like individual instruction or private lessons or something 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Mm-hmm <affirmative> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>So you go through a bunch of students and some are just super beginners and they want to be, you know, given a good start and clear other people have very particular projects and they're focused and just want you to help them out. But once in a while you'll encounter someone who's just got the bug and they wanna do something awesome. They don't know what it's gonna be, but they're just like eating everything up. And I think <span style="color:red" data-ts="463.52" data-end_ts="463.64" title="463.52" id=c_"463.52">__I__</span>, you mentioned about some people I sort of launched or got going in max. I don't think it's that. I think I just mostly just found some good people and gave 'em a good kick. Basically. I'm thinking of people like, I don't know, Jeff's Lubo, at least Baldwin Ben Bracken, Patrice <span style="color:red" data-ts="481.28" data-end_ts="481.56" title="481.28" id=c_"481.28">__scan__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="481.9" data-end_ts="482.12" title="481.9" id=c_"481.9">__to__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="482.26" data-end_ts="482.48" title="482.26" id=c_"482.26">__be__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="482.61" data-end_ts="482.96" title="482.61" id=c_"482.61">__Machi__</span> Carter, probably a lot more and people who are just doing really cool things with max and then they just needed to, be shown a lot more interesting worlds and, and maybe ways of, making the whole thing more manageable. And then <span style="color:red" data-ts="499.68" data-end_ts="499.8" title="499.68" id=c_"499.68">__he__</span> went off and did amazing things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, so when you're working with someone like that, someone that you feel already kind of has their arms conceptually around things and, and you're gonna kind of push them a little further out of the nest. What is, is there like some general concepts that you often run into or is it super individualistic? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="524.9" data-end_ts="525.12" title="524.9" id=c_"524.9">__Mm__</span> I'd say the one thing that you see over and over again is this, this way of working with max where you kind of patch a bunch of stuff together and cover it with duct tape and it <span style="color:red" data-ts="539.6" data-end_ts="539.76" title="539.6" id=c_"539.6">__ki__</span> you can kind of get it to work, but <span style="color:red" data-ts="541.32" data-end_ts="541.48" title="541.32" id=c_"541.32">__it__</span>, it can't work reliably. And so that's one thing is I try to convince people to, you know, do really good tools for storing and recalling and, and, controlling things during the course of experience. So yeah, I guess, memory and storage, clean signal paths, and just, you know, good audio principles. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>There's weird thing about a lot of computer music is they kind of forget the fact that it's just audio and you just have to <laugh> so you have to, think of keeping the sound clean and, and, having a good mix and so forth. And, and the other thing is, is, a lot of times when people are going really gungho and max, or probably any, art software, there's a tendency to, to go down a rabbit hole, or to be so enchanted by the beauty of, of software that you forget that your piece sort of doesn't sound good. Right. So I try to get people to like to sit back and, and just listen to it. Like they didn't know how it was being made, or people are starting a new project. I say, well, the first thing <span style="color:red" data-ts="616.36" data-end_ts="616.44" title="616.36" id=c_"616.36">__to__</span> do is just to go for a walk <laugh> and just think about what you actually wanna do, you know? And, so, yeah, a lot of times when I, when I go to a concert, I try to forget how the music is being made, how many, you know, different land networks or communicating with each other and just listen and look, and, and try to appreciate for what it 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="639.52" data-end_ts="639.72" title="639.52" id=c_"639.52">__Is__</span>. Well, I think that's, that's a really interesting conceptual base because I think you see this in a lot of different kinds of art form, you know, in the music world, guitarists sometimes gets so focused on what guitar pedals they have that they forget they're supposed to be playing, or, you know, my passion, which is the modular synth is horrible about that. You can get so wrapped up in the joy of patching that you forget that you bought the thing initially to make some music, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>It's a real common problem. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I think it is. And I can see where max could en<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_(software)">Jitter</a> the same kind of thing, especially, and I don't know how often do you run in this thing where people really are their vision for how they're going to use max is sort of like to invent their own grand unifying theory of the universe. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b><laugh> well, that's one of the addictive aspects of computer programming in general, I think is once you forget about the fact that it's just a machine, that's blinking lights, you start seeing these perfectly constructed class structures and systems and, and you can create a perfect world, you know, unlike every other part of your 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Life, everything else is sloppy, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>Yeah. Yeah. But of course it has problems too, and you keep crashing kind of new versions. And so it's, it's never finished, but you know, it's always just beyond your grasp. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. So as an outsider, you can see that, but do you ever, do you still get emotional when machines crash or programs misbehave or whatever, or, or do, do you <span style="color:red" data-ts="749.36" data-end_ts="749.6" title="749.36" id=c_"749.36">__feel__</span> like you have like the Zen grasp of avoiding that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>Well, I mean, there's some things like when you're getting close to performance and your patch crashes, it's just like stop everything and figure out why it crashed, you know, mm-hmm, <affirmative>, you have to chase those things down and you have to have backups and all other stuff. I think, and, and, and if you do that carefully, if you have enough experience and, and try to bash things around, then you can have some pretty major crashes and you'll know how to get out of it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>So depends. I tell students, well, time, see <span style="color:red" data-ts="790.32" data-end_ts="790.54" title="790.32" id=c_"790.32">__lot__</span> takes you to reboot your computer and launch your patch again. And, and so it's like 90 seconds. Okay. Well then, you know, if you crash in concert, you're just gonna have to wait in 90 seconds. <span style="color:red" data-ts="799.48" data-end_ts="799.7" title="799.48" id=c_"799.48">__Mm__</span>. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="800.06" data-end_ts="800.22" title="800.06" id=c_"800.06">__that__</span> gives people a lot of calm, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>Like they know what they're gonna deal with. The thing that gets really, I think the emotions only come up when, <span style="color:red" data-ts="810.88" data-end_ts="811.1" title="810.88" id=c_"810.88">__if__</span> something that just doesn't make any sense or some bizarre little arcane rule that you just had to learn after three hours of wasting your time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, I have to admit, and, and this is sort of like one of those things I would never normally admit, but, I sometimes end up just raging a little bit. <laugh> right. And it's because there are times, it, it seems as if computers and software systems actually have some kind of knowledge about how much stress you're under <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>Mm-hmm <affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And so it'll, it's inevitable that, and, and maybe it's just kind of being able to cope, you know, if, if I'm not under a lot of stress and it crashes, I guess I feel like, well, okay, I can, you know, use sort of like the methods I have at hand to be able to resolve the problem and fix it. But when it's like getting really close to a performance and, you know, it starts crashing and <span style="color:red" data-ts="876.4" data-end_ts="876.62" title="876.4" id=c_"876.4">__it__</span> crashed that way and this machine hates me and it's unfair and <laugh>, you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>Know, yes. That's all true. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. It seems that way. Anyway. Well 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>I just, from doing so much, live sound, I think, think, or studio work where there's just this tremendous economic pressure or whatever, I've just found that I may be freaking out inside, but that's not gonna help me at all. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>And the only thing that's gonna help me out is just to be super calm and, and try to be objective. And you know, that, that filming special, kill your babies. Sometimes you just have to let go of your big, wonderful idea and do it however it works. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Yeah. That's actually, that's something that I try and impart on students. Is that putting yourself in the position. I, I really like this idea of, you know, shut down the computer, bring it back up, understand what that potential part of a performance is, because it seems like a lot of preparing for sort of like calmness and performance is to sort of have experienced everything you're liable to experience. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And, you hope right. But, and if you're thoughtful about it, you can at least get, you can put to, you can experience a large number of the things that you're likely to experience anyway, but that's really, that's kind of an interesting thing we said. I think it's also something that everybody, or, or especially people who don't have a lot of background in doing live work, the assumption is I'm, I'm going to plan for the <span style="color:red" data-ts="980.64" data-end_ts="980.88" title="980.64" id=c_"980.64">__bare__</span> very best, experience that could happen. And mm-hmm, <affirmative>, I think if you prepare yourself also, you know, have contingency plans and prepare yourself for the many less than optimal ways, things could work that there's, there's some real value in that if nothing else to make yourself, as you suggested, feel like something happened, you kind of know what the timing of be having to cope with. It might be. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>Yeah. Yeah. And have, you know, know that you have various forms of backups and so forth. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So now you, you mentioned working with, well, first of all, you mentioned, doing recordings of punk bands and stuff. It's interesting. I, I didn't know that about you and it's actually a, a background that we share because some of my earliest work was when I was down in Texas and I was sort of like, one of the recording engineers for the, Texas punks, which there was a bit of a movement down there. And it was really, it was a real fun time. Although the, what you talked about is economic pressures were very real in that scenario because most of these people had next zero money 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>Mm-hmm 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative>. And so you did have to really operate quickly, but you also had to sort of honor the genre. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>Oh, that almost rhymes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, it does. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1078.38" data-end_ts="1078.6" title="1078.38" id=c_"1078.38">__Ye__</span> but, you know, because there was, you know, certainly in the Texas punk scene, there was a very specific sound that people were after. And if you could kind of capture that, it represented, you know, it's, it represented what they wanted to hear themselves be. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>Yeah. Yeah. I mean, at that, to your point in time, I was mostly an assistant engineer. Okay. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1106.51" data-end_ts="1107" title="1106.51" id=c_"1106.51">__Working__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1107" data-end_ts="1107.24" title="1107" id=c_"1107">__with__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1107.24" data-end_ts="1107.4" title="1107.24" id=c_"1107.24">__that__</span> people, the, the beauty of some of the, the punk movement was kind of this rejection of refinement 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Mm-hmm <affirmative> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>But of course it became codified as well. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Of course. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>But, the, I guess in terms of my, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>I mean, I, I really enjoy the music and, and, and began to understand the idea of translating from a really great live performance onto a studio track, you know, things like for God's sake, get the first take down, you know, right. Always try to do that. And, the particular studio that I worked at Hyde street, one of the owners, Dan Alexander is incredible equipment dealer. He would find all these amazing old tube, mics and class a consoles, and we'd be doing a project and he'd say, oh, well, we're taking out this rack unit and giving you this rack <span style="color:red" data-ts="1165.39" data-end_ts="1165.55" title="1165.39" id=c_"1165.39">__in__</span> it and you'd have to, or there'd be some beautiful old Neve, but it wouldn't, you couldn't get the automation to work. And so we're constantly dealing with things breaking down and having to work around them. Mm-hmm <affirmative> I think that was a really useful 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_02: </b>Training. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1180.91" data-end_ts="1181.23" title="1180.91" id=c_"1180.91">__There__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>Was. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now you said that you were doing life sound too. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>Yeah. Not, a huge amount of rock and roll, but sort of all kinds of different bands, like the ensemble band is, is say, you know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_02: </b>
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>New music ensemble, theater type stuff of the Frankfurt ballet. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see. Sure. Okay. So that, that kind of, that kind of meshed with your move into the dance world, then you're saying, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I, what was started working this studio, I just wanted to do it, the weird stuff and would come in to some strange project I wanted to get on that, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>So the ballet actually, this really weird thing happened to me in my life. In the mid eighties, I was living in San Francisco, working at, at <span style="color:red" data-ts="1239" data-end_ts="1239.16" title="1239" id=c_"1239">__height__</span> street, doing a lot of rock and punk and whatever. And in the evening I would take a ballet class for whatever reason, in the morning when I would wake up and my mind was still fresh, I would study, post-structuralist theory, post-modern art and so forth. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. So there were like these three worlds that had nothing to do with each other. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. And so when I was invited, when I got this gig with the San Francisco <span style="color:red" data-ts="1266.99" data-end_ts="1267.21" title="1266.99" id=c_"1266.99">__bla__</span> to record this music for Tom Williams and Williams ForSight, suddenly I was doing post modern art with the ballet company in the studio, and like they all came together. And then I fell in love with my, future mom of my daughter mm-hmm <affirmative> Elizabeth Corbit and just moved to Europe and that kind of changed my life. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Wow. That's, that's amazing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1295.38" data-end_ts="1295.62" title="1295.38" id=c_"1295.38">__Yeah__</span>, on the top of the Paris opera on the, on the roof, I found, a flipper, graffiti. So I was actually, I was actually made an honorary member a flipper. I dunno if anyone remembers that, but that was my one claim to <span style="color:red" data-ts="1309.06" data-end_ts="1309.22" title="1309.06" id=c_"1309.06">__fame__</span>. <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You were an honorary member. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>Yeah. Yeah. Oh, well, they <span style="color:red" data-ts="1317.46" data-end_ts="1317.66" title="1317.46" id=c_"1317.46">__sh__</span> when they were gonna record, you know, remember a sex bomb. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>When they came in the studio to record that, they <span style="color:red" data-ts="1324.85" data-end_ts="1325.14" title="1324.85" id=c_"1324.85">__base__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1325.14" data-end_ts="1325.34" title="1325.14" id=c_"1325.14">__there__</span> forgot to bring in space. So they used my base. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1328.72" data-end_ts="1328.94" title="1328.72" id=c_"1328.72">__Oh__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1329.92" data-end_ts="1330.34" title="1329.92" id=c_"1329.92">__Here's__</span> silver <span style="color:red" data-ts="1330.5" data-end_ts="1330.78" title="1330.5" id=c_"1330.5">__tone__</span>. That was baby blue and had bandy stickers all over it. <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Nice. Well, that's, that's something 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1339.18" data-end_ts="1339.38" title="1339.18" id=c_"1339.18">__Really__</span> right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> well, I just, I just need that stuff in my head because, it helps me understand it, it helps me like, embrace all the different places that we come from. Right. Hmm. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1354.04" data-end_ts="1354.26" title="1354.04" id=c_"1354.04">__And__</span> all the different, like internalized tattoos that we all wear 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>Or, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1361.01" data-end_ts="1361.3" title="1361.01" id=c_"1361.01">__okay__</span>. Scars. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So this is, is interesting to hear kind of like how your interest both coalesced into, you know, move into the next stage, but how also, it sounds like it was a flyer, you know, somewhat, somewhat based in, you know, meeting this woman, some of it based in your own interests. And I imagine the opportunity to just go and work in Europe just seemed like a pretty awesome opportunity anyway. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>Yeah. That was amazing to be able to actually make art and be paid for it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Yeah, indeed. And so you, you went to Frankfurt and, it sounds like that was kind of where, what would become the future less kind of always incubated because you sort of took the knowledge you got from the recording studio, but also the knowledge from some of these other areas that you were studying. And it sounds like that's where they, they started to come together for you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>Yeah. You know, it's, always in the back of my mind, I thought of myself as a musician and I wanted to write music, but everything I'd made was really bad. <laugh>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1439.32" data-end_ts="1439.44" title="1439.32" id=c_"1439.32">__I__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1439.44" data-end_ts="1439.56" title="1439.44" id=c_"1439.44">__mean__</span>, all this bad music and I was just like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1441.08" data-end_ts="1441.28" title="1441.08" id=c_"1441.08">__oh__</span> God. And, when I finally started using drum machines and samplers and studio technology to make rhythmic music for dance, suddenly people started liking my music. Plus I was in this environment where the artistic standards are really high and kind of cutting edge and cool. So it was a, it was just this amazing, it was just a complete, flowering. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So do you think that they liked your music because it sounded, different than what musicians were typically making or was it because they were a little entranced by the technology or was it that somehow working with the machines activated a different voice for you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>Yeah. What, how did that aesthetic emerge? I think it, it's a number of different things, so I never really caught the synthesizer bug. I don't usually use any kind of synthesized sound. I'll always use recorded sound. That's part of just having worked in the studio all this time. Mm-hmm <affirmative> and I've always had some sort of sense for, for interesting rhythms. I think at that time, a lot of the electronic music was, I mean, there there's so much freedom in experimental music, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1530.66" data-end_ts="1530.88" title="1530.66" id=c_"1530.66">__so__</span> a lot of times people make music that's quite wonderful, but you couldn't possibly use it for a dance. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>For some reason, I, I, I just, had this immediate feedback, like it would make something and there would be people dancing to it or not. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1545.61" data-end_ts="1545.96" title="1545.61" id=c_"1545.61">__Right__</span>. And just learn very quickly and, developed a, a particular style that was sort of, sort of semi acoustic, and, and multiple genres mixed together. And that became me, I just, and, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1564.8" data-end_ts="1564.92" title="1564.8" id=c_"1564.8">__I__</span> just had the good fortune of, of getting some great gigs right. At the beginning. And, and all of a sudden I was a dance music composer. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, did you, when you say that you had this immediate feedback, did you, were you actually, did you have like a bunch of equipment there and some dancers and you would try things out or did you like record a bunch of things? And 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>Yeah, the usual pattern is to make like a little sample and see what they think. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>Well, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1593.48" data-end_ts="1593.68" title="1593.48" id=c_"1593.48">__cause__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1593.68" data-end_ts="1593.84" title="1593.68" id=c_"1593.68">__cause__</span> early on I, I, I tried to talk to a choreographer about music mm-hmm <affirmative> and just realized they had no idea what I was talking about. <laugh> well, I'd be say so like, well, what if we did this with eighth notes? And they'd be like, I don't know, it should be faster. I don't know <laugh> and so, so I learned, okay, we're speaking two very different languages. They both happen at the same time, but the best way for me to communicate to you is just to give you music and tell you to listen to 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>And then also I began to learn how, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1627.28" data-end_ts="1627.5" title="1627.28" id=c_"1627.28">__if__</span>, if you make a piece of music that's expressing a really clear mood or emotion or something, it's only gonna be useful for a limited number of things. So it's more interesting if you can make something that's ambiguous in terms of what it's evoking. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Yeah. That makes, that makes sense. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1652.24" data-end_ts="1652.46" title="1652.24" id=c_"1652.24">__And__</span> you know, there's one thing I tell a lot of people <span style="color:red" data-ts="1654.38" data-end_ts="1654.54" title="1654.38" id=c_"1654.38">__who__</span> tell people who, when they wanna do music for dance to keep in mind is, is a, a choreographer at this point in time has access to all the world's music, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>They could use anything from any part of the world, any period of time, the best performers edit, how they want and half the time they don't even pay any rights for it. Mm-hmm <affirmative> so that's, you're competing against the world who's working for free. And what can you as a single composer offer? I think the main thing you can offer is to make something unique and to try to find some sort of unique connection with the choreographer's vision. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You know, I, I work with dancers occasionally and, and choreographers. One of the things I notice about them is they have a tendency to embrace two kinds of music. On one hand, they tend to like things that are very emotional. So I hear a lot of selection of things with soaring, violin, solos, or 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>Whatever, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Or they go with the like completely idiosyncratic, sort of like, a bad day in Tom wait's life. Right. <laugh> kind of thing. And there's something about either this highly emotional or highly quirky, and particularly if the rhythms kind of have a quirky lo to him or what, whatever, there tends to be a really, an interest in these kind of particular mechanisms. And, I mean, that's at least been my experience. Do you, do you feel like there's some commonalities in the things that you see? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>Well, sort of that certainly that emotional thing is always a strong draw. Yeah, because it's just one more element to make your big piece powerful. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>You know, and if you can have really powerful emotional music, that's great. And then if, if you have music that's kind of more confusing or, or quirky, that just makes whatever you do on stage more interesting. I mean, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1788.93" data-end_ts="1789.13" title="1788.93" id=c_"1788.93">__cuz__</span> it's a, it's a tricky thing watching people dance for a half hour, you know, mm-hmm, <affirmative> like what you actually watch, what you remember in the music really provides a framework for, for understanding the whole piece usually. So you're also dealing with what dancers have experienced that works for them. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. You're kind of, you're having to deal with that with that whole boatload of stuff as well. Right. So one of the things I, I feel in having worked recruit dancers and from talking with other people, one of the words you just used was, has always been really important, this idea of powerful statements, Uhhuh <affirmative>. It seems to me that that's a, that is a, a common and very important thing in sort of the dance, the dance world. But there's this kind of flip side, which a lot of people who've tried working with dancers and haven't done well when I talk to 'em have having worked with dancers, although I generally do visuals and not music having worked with them, I realize that these composers, when they're talking have an overly inflated sense of how important their part was, <laugh> in the performance, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>Oh yeah. That's that's the first, wall to climb over <span style="color:red" data-ts="1876.91" data-end_ts="1877.13" title="1876.91" id=c_"1876.91">__in__</span> your own ego. Yeah. Because I, people make art a lot of times because they can do their very personal vision. They don't have to explain it to anybody. They can do it just the way they want. And particularly in arts, like maybe painting and music, you can just really go into your cave and, and create some amazing castle of your own invention and just that no one else can understand, but you think it's perfect. With things like theater and dance are, let's say film, people are used to working a, a group of people. And so there's, there's generally a director and all, and a bunch of other artists who have to work towards a directors vision. And I think that's what you have to realize is that using it's a collaboration between music and dance, but actually usually it's the choreographer who got the gig. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>They have the artistic power really mm-hmm <affirmative> and you have to fit into their, vision. Now the way to get around that is to <span style="color:red" data-ts="1940.15" data-end_ts="1940.37" title="1940.15" id=c_"1940.15">__ESP__</span> work really fast and come up with a lot of interesting ideas that just leapfrog them and say, wait a minute, why don't you just do this crazy thing? And, and suddenly, if you can, if you can do that sort of thing, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1950.09" data-end_ts="1950.25" title="1950.09" id=c_"1950.09">__then__</span> you can kind of, you know, exert some influence on the final piece. But if you're always wait around for what do you want, and then you try to give them what they're asking for. Mm-hmm <affirmative> it makes the whole thing, a lot slower. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, especially now that their, their option is either to sit there and listen to you, fail repeatedly or get on iTunes and choose any one of the 50 million tracks that are on there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>Yeah. I know. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> it's really, it, it, that, that makes it pretty intense, I think. Well 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>Also I think, you know, you can't, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1989.52" data-end_ts="1989.64" title="1989.52" id=c_"1989.52">__a__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1989.94" data-end_ts="1990.16" title="1989.94" id=c_"1989.94">__ER__</span>, isn't necessarily the best music teacher, like 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>True. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1996.26" data-end_ts="1996.48" title="1996.26" id=c_"1996.26">__In__</span> fact, they're giving you may be correct in their mind, but the words have the exact opposite effect on how you hear them. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. They may not make sense or they may actually be the opposite language of what you would expect. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>Yeah. Yeah. And, so I mean, another thing I tell people who are thinking about <span style="color:red" data-ts="2015.68" data-end_ts="2015.84" title="2015.68" id=c_"2015.68">__the__</span> music for dance is just go watch lots of dance. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>I think I go to more dance concerts and music concerts, and you can see, you can see all the cliches and you can see what works and what doesn't, and, and, it's really important to develop your own taste and to be able to argue your taste. That's one thing I really learned from living in Europe was, man, you do a performance and here in California, everyone comes back and says, oh, it's so beautiful. Awesome, great. But in Europe, some guy will walk up and say, you know, your piece sucked because of this, this and this 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>So I was like pay attention to that. You know, I learned very alone that whenever someone gives you feedback, even if they don't have any experience or expertise, there's something in that that is useful to you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Well, and, and it's also important because they actually cared enough to sort of like broach that wall and say what they had to say. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>Mm-hmm <affirmative>, mm-hmm 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative> which that represents a high value in, in some way, I guess. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, so as you, after you, did this for a while and you got the opportunity to hang out at your chem, it doesn't sound like you had any like super formal music education before you went there, did you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>No, no. I'm a definitely a failed musician sort of education wise. Cause I, in college I studied math and physics 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Uhhuh <affirmative> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>And then just, picked up bits of music. I mean, learning electric bass, you learn all about harmony, right. Jazz and stuff. And well there is a certain ear <span style="color:red" data-ts="2119.8" data-end_ts="2120.04" title="2119.8" id=c_"2119.8">__calm__</span> style that's based on a lot of French music is based on harmonic color. And so a lot of Aircom music is, is based on <span style="color:red" data-ts="2131.67" data-end_ts="2131.83" title="2131.67" id=c_"2131.67">__this__</span> sub I see complex extensions of, of traditional contemporary orchestra music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, so how is it that you felt comfortable or maybe you didn't, going in there and ending up with a job? I mean, was it intimidating? I mean, for people who aren't familiar or who, who haven't spent time there sort of like <span style="color:red" data-ts="2159.41" data-end_ts="2159.7" title="2159.41" id=c_"2159.41">__your__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2159.7" data-end_ts="2159.94" title="2159.7" id=c_"2159.7">__chem__</span> has this, sort of like daunting feel to it, like, you know, you have to have an extremely, you have to have a brain that's like coming out of your ears in order to be able to go, you know, be there. And, you know, I've been lucky enough to know a lot of people who've been, you know, involved with <span style="color:red" data-ts="2181.4" data-end_ts="2181.62" title="2181.4" id=c_"2181.4">__ear__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2181.72" data-end_ts="2181.94" title="2181.72" id=c_"2181.72">__cam__</span> in one way or another. But I think the general sense is that it's a, it's kind of a scary and intimidating world. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I sort of, fortunately came in sort of the, the back door and then once they accept you, it it's like a community. It's a family sort of thing. I very quickly after I started working there, I'm like maybe within two or three months, I took over the job as a musical assistant for <span style="color:red" data-ts="2209.64" data-end_ts="2209.86" title="2209.64" id=c_"2209.64">__PI__</span> Les mm-hmm <affirmative> and this was this huge max project, that involved a lot of translation and stuff. And I think just reading from him was this kind of calmness. Like I know he knows that working with computers takes forever and all these crashes and he's just a patient and as long as you're really working hard and, and you know, not bullshitting him, he's gonna respect that. Yeah. There were a lot of sleepless nights and, there's also spirit of asking for help as part of the whole max community. Mm-hmm <affirmative> I mean, any day I could walk down the hall and ask Miller puck for advice. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>And then for a while there, David Zig <span style="color:red" data-ts="2255.82" data-end_ts="2255.94" title="2255.82" id=c_"2255.82">__re__</span> was in the same office and got court lippy in fact subtle. So they're just like all kinds of people asked for great help. Right. And all you do all day is work on computer music. So sooner or later you're gonna get something that works. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I guess <laugh>, I guess, well, that must have been a pretty interesting time because you're that list of names you just threw out there, are all really significant names in the, or the cannon of electronic music. And did, was there a sense at the time of something really exciting happening or was it just so kind of heads down doing the work that you didn't think of it in those terms? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>The thing about <span style="color:red" data-ts="2298.46" data-end_ts="2298.86" title="2298.46" id=c_"2298.46">__income__</span> is you're you're doing whatever project you're doing and there are all these guests visiting it from all over the world. Mm-hmm <affirmative> so basically you meet everybody, who's anybody from all over the world who's coming through. And it's, it's really exciting. I felt like I was kind of on the pulse of, of electronic music. So, I mean, sure. There was there's a lot of times <span style="color:red" data-ts="2320.88" data-end_ts="2321.16" title="2320.88" id=c_"2320.88">__you're__</span> just staring at a screen full of numbers and screaming, but, you know, there is this excitement that you're, you're trying new things and, and it was just really exciting to see the trans to watch this weird little software max develop into this, this huge thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>If we fast forward to the present, I mean, everything we've talked about to this point has really been focused on music, but a fair amount of the work that you've been doing in the last number of years has been visuals. Hasn't it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>Yeah. Yeah. I guess around 2005, 2006, I kind of got bored with my own music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>And I was getting these commissions and I was needing deadlines, but I thought, oh man, I'm not doing anything creative or new <span style="color:red" data-ts="2371.71" data-end_ts="2371.93" title="2371.71" id=c_"2371.71">__and__</span> all sounding the same. And so I just made a complete break and just started studying video and happened to be a great time to start was like right at the beginning of the HD era mm-hmm 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative> and also some pretty big price drops in yeah. The necessary tools. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>That's right. That's right. Everything just became cheap and accessible and faster. And so it was really, and I enjoy it a lot. I mean, it it's shooting videos a lot, like recording music or doing a live concert <span style="color:red" data-ts="2401.49" data-end_ts="2401.93" title="2401.49" id=c_"2401.49">__through__</span> you're capturing something and doing, and I naturally started gravitating towards doing video for dance mm-hmm <affirmative> and then combining it to, you know, what, when I was making music for dance, it's really fascinating to what to see what happens. You have some sort of musical structure and what will the dancers do to it, right. Like this crazy connection that you can't predict. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>With video, it's a different thing because you know, music, you can hear it when you're not looking at it video, you have to look at it. Right. And you have to look at the dance. So it's a difficult problem. I mean, a lot of times the video become just like a piece of the scenery. Yeah. Or, or like maybe Frier, vices, vices tracking stuff becomes like costumes or something. Right. Or can just be a competition and really wreck everything. If you're trying to focus on both things at once. You know, so I've been trying to come up with video ideas that relate to the movement itself. I've done a little bit of work with dancers and sort of sensors attached to their bodies. And recently I've been trying to, work with, with images that suggest dance, that could be a score for dance mm-hmm 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>So this is, yeah, this, this actually the current project I'm working on right now is trying to build this, anthropomorphic blob, this human blob, humanoid blob, whatever that would be built using using physics in open GL and projected on top of a dancer. And the dancer would, would use that as an inspiration for improvisation or for working out choreography. Okay. So it wouldn't be, actually, it wouldn't be actual gestures, but it'd be something that looks kind of like a human gesture, but you're not sure if it's an arm or a leg. Okay. And, and that gives a dancer just enough ambiguity and freedom to, to play with it. And I was hoping to use this, some of this three dimensional data to, to drive the music too. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Mm-hmm <affirmative> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>But this is some sort of, you know, long <span style="color:red" data-ts="2523.6" data-end_ts="2523.84" title="2523.6" id=c_"2523.6">__term__</span> project, I don't know. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>Eventually end up. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So you say that you've, you've tried using sensors and stuff. Were you ever successful in getting something that you were happy with? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>Yeah. Yeah. For brief shining moments. Probably the most successful piece. Like that was the piece I did with Jeffrey Shaw, Agnes and Johnson. Backrock at the Tokyo I museum where we had this puppet model. Like one of those artists would models, right. That was maybe three feet high. And it was in a, immersive 3d projection space with eight channel sound and you'd manipulate this body and space and it would control the, the visuals and the music. And, I think that was a pretty cool piece. But in terms of live humans, one of the big problems is that the dancers have, they already have enough to do just to dance, you know, right. To make these gestures and shapes and space takes up your entire brain. It really does. And to ask dancers to, to focus on the rhythm and stuff or focus on musical structure is almost asking too much. So, you know, I, I, I tend to, to work with that with an idea that the music or video making machine is being controlled is kind of going along on its <span style="color:red" data-ts="2607.4" data-end_ts="2607.6" title="2607.4" id=c_"2607.4">__own__</span>. And then the, the dancer or whatever is kind of pushing a new one direction another, so they're not, they're not holding up the whole structure. They're just kind of staring it a little bit. You have to give them the opportunity to the, you know, ability to fail and have things still move forward and so forth. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2625.11" data-end_ts="2625.19" title="2625.11" id=c_"2625.11">__in__</span> speaking of that, has there ever been anything that has just been, that you've worked hard on and has been just <span style="color:red" data-ts="2631.91" data-end_ts="2632.03" title="2631.91" id=c_"2631.91">__a__</span> absolute failure? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b><laugh> well, so many <span style="color:red" data-ts="2637.55" data-end_ts="2637.67" title="2637.55" id=c_"2637.55">__to__</span> choose from really so many to choose from 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b><laugh> but, one that comes to mind was long ago. I first started doing max, I thought, oh wow, I'm gonna, I'm gonna build a max patch that I'll give it a melody and a key and it'll do voice leading cord progressions, harmonization mm-hmm 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>So, and I spent months on <span style="color:red" data-ts="2659.75" data-end_ts="2659.95" title="2659.75" id=c_"2659.75">__this__</span> thing with, I mean, it must have been a, this was back in, I don't know, max three or something. It was just all these crazy structures trying to make it work. And I finally got someone to work, you know, it like here's an actual correctly voice <span style="color:red" data-ts="2674.1" data-end_ts="2674.32" title="2674.1" id=c_"2674.1">__led__</span> harmonization of a melody. And I had to sit back and say, God, I can just do that on my own so much better. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>Just by ear, not even having any musical education at wrong. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. That's that's hilarious. Well, because that kind of does point too to, I was gonna say maybe it was worse in the past than it is now, but I think people, if anything, have a stronger belief right now in computing as being able to solve all our problems for us and make everything easier. And oh yeah. The fact that sometimes that's just, that's such a red herring 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>Mm-hmm 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative>, you know, especially when you're talking about artistic work, because it's so easy to get wrapped up in embracing the technology and using it to amplify, whatever you're thinking to the point where you just become, you know, your thought processes then end up being just sort of an extension of the available technology. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>You're just making demos. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You're just making demos. That's exactly right. And it's, I think it's a real slippery slope. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>Yeah. I mean just if we zoom out, looking at life in general, I mean, just keep in mind that all of humanity happened, all these amazing lives and art and ventures for thousands and thousands of years, all that happened without any kind of computer or even a fax machine. So there's, you can have, you can have an incredible life without any of this technology at all. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I think that, I think that this was the first time that a fax machine has ever reared its head in my podcast. So I wanna thank you for that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b><laugh> okay. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>No, but I, I agree. And it's, and especially when you're working with something like dance, where to certain extent, even with the most modern of dance, you still really do feel kind of the primitive and, visual nature of it in comparison to anything that you would, you can do on a computer 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>Mm-hmm <affirmative> mm-hmm <affirmative>. Yeah. And, and that's one way I that's one reason I keep getting drawn to actual samples of real sounds or real movement in, in working with those there's richness there that, is hard to create from scratch. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So where do you think in, in the worlds that you interact with, which, you know, remain really kind of focused around this dance world, where do you think, where do you think the near term future is gonna take us? I mean, I ask <span style="color:red" data-ts="2844.04" data-end_ts="2844.16" title="2844.04" id=c_"2844.04">__you__</span> for no other reason, then I'd like to prepare myself for the next time I have to deal with dancers. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>Oh, well, you know, stylistically dance is in an amazing phase right now. So much of the 20th century was spent in breaking rules and coming up with new languages and then breaking those rules. And, and then the whole technology thing was just added onto that. It was just like one new technology after another. And we're now at a point where there's all this stuff available and you can sit back and say, well, maybe I don't care about being on the cutting edge. How can I make my personal statement? So in <span style="color:red" data-ts="2888.48" data-end_ts="2888.8" title="2888.48" id=c_"2888.48">__particular__</span>, in choreographically, you see people like, let's say crystal pipe from, Vancouver, who is just combining ballet and, pop locking and creating a very personal, but extremely complex and rich style of movement. And also in terms of technology, we've already seen a lot of the low hanging fruit, like, projection mapping and tracking and so forth. So I think the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2919.35" data-end_ts="2919.64" title="2919.35" id=c_"2919.35">__cure__</span>, the really interesting thing is, is people who come over really original ideas that combine high tech and low tech and, and enable the physical body to remain powerful in spite of being surrounded by a bunch of computers. How'd that sound? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That, that actually sounds pretty good. And, and at the same time, it's by categorizing almost anything that I've ever done as low hanging fruit. <laugh> I feel like I have to go back to the lab now. <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>Well, you know, we're all <span style="color:red" data-ts="2951.36" data-end_ts="2951.6" title="2951.36" id=c_"2951.36">__just__</span>, that's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2952.28" data-end_ts="2952.36" title="2952.28" id=c_"2952.28">__where__</span> we all start. That's the best place to start with 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>All we all. Well, we all have short arms, so mm-hmm, <affirmative> fruit is the important fruit. Well, Les, I want to thank you so much for taking the time, this evening to talk with me. I hope that, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2967.52" data-end_ts="2967.8" title="2967.52" id=c_"2967.52">__that__</span> pleasure, I hope that you enjoy the discussion as much as I do. I just, every time I talk to you, I feel like I learn new stuff. And in as much as I talk about other people being, you know, you launching them or inspiring them to do things in sometimes very subtle and very simple ways. I find that every time I talk to you, I come away inspired and, with new ideas. So I want to thank you personally for that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>No, you're being too kind. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, no, I'm not being even kind enough <laugh> but anyway, so I, I just want to thank you again for the time and, for your willingness to talk about this stuff. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3006.56" data-end_ts="3006.68" title="3006.56" id=c_"3006.56">__I__</span>, we have had people on the podcast that have dealt with dancers, but we haven't gotten into it in as much depth. And to me, it's such a vital world right now. It's, it's a world that is really interesting to work with. And so I appreciate you talking to us about it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Les: </b>It was a pleasure <span style="color:red" data-ts="3023.52" data-end_ts="3023.72" title="3023.52" id=c_"3023.52">__darling__</span>. All 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, well, thanks a lot. And, have a great evening. I'll talk to you later. Okay. Bye. Okay. There's podcast number 33 in <span style="color:red" data-ts="3034.52" data-end_ts="3034.68" title="3034.52" id=c_"3034.52">__the__</span> pocket. A great opportunity to get caught up with less stuck. I want to thank again, everyone for their support and listenership. The number of subscriptions continues to grow is does the number of people listening. If you have any questions, comments, or any other ideas, please make sure you drop me a <span style="color:red" data-ts="3053.08" data-end_ts="3055.64" title="3053.08" id=c_"3053.08">__line@ddgcyclingseventyfour.com__</span>. Otherwise I will see you next weekend. Great.
