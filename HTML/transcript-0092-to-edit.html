<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Here's a great one. I know you're going to enjoy by somebody that's probably in your mind right now. A little chat with Dennis DeSantis Sorry for some of the, Skype schmutz at the beginning of the interview. We got it figured out, and I think I am gonna be able to avoid it in the future, but, ah, well, so here we go with Dennis. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today I'm going to be talking to somebody that I think we probably all know. His name's Dennis DeSantis and he has been working for Ableton for a long, long time. I got to know him first, as a presenter at the NAMM Show for Ableton. But recently he put out a book that has really caught the attention of a lot of people. It's called Making Music 74 Creative Strategies for Electronic Music Producers. It's been flying off the shelf and practically everybody I know either has a copy of it or has an ebook of it or something. So, it, it really <span style="color:red" data-ts="68.035" data-end_ts="68.255" title="68.035" id=c_"68.035">__is__</span>, got a lot of popularity. So, with that, let's, let's say hello to Dennis. Hi, Dennis. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis DeSantis: </b>Good. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm great. Thanks a lot for joining us for the podcast. It's really great to have you on board. Let's start off by having you explain, I mean, I kinda gave a little introduction there, but let's have you explain, how you identify yourself. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>Yeah, it's a good question. <laugh>, I mean, <laugh>, how does <span style="color:red" data-ts="94.255" data-end_ts="94.535" title="94.255" id=c_"94.255">__that__</span> identify themselves? I guess these days? I'm primarily, <span style="color:red" data-ts="99.495" data-end_ts="99.615" title="99.495" id=c_"99.495">__I__</span>, I hear this word, music technologists get thrown around and Right. I never quite know what that means, but I guess, I guess that's probably the closest thing to what I do. I mean, at least my day job is working for Ableton, working primarily on the products that we make. I'm, I'm also in some ways a musician, although I'm not pursuing as much as a career path these days. But it's still, you know, the thing that kind of motivates everything else I do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That makes a lot of sense. Now, you say that, but just, just for doing the kind of demo work and interactive work you do as well as for testing out software, you kinda end up having to do a lot of music just for that, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>Of course. Yeah. Yeah, definitely. I mean, and it's, it's good that I come from a background as a musician to be able to do that stuff. And it's definitely, I mean, making my own music is still the kind of the thing that keeps me interested in this world in the first place. Sure. It's just not a great way to pay the bills <laugh>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="159.895" data-end_ts="160.175" title="159.895" id=c_"159.895">__Yeah__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. You're right about that. So the one thing that you didn't say but that you might be most well known for at the moment is being an author. How did that come about? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>Yeah. It's to add this extra name to my <laugh> to my resume. 'cause it's a, it's a fairly, fairly recent development. So, I mean, I've had this idea in the back of my head for a while to write a book that somehow touched on the creative process and how it applied more directly to electronic musicians than, than kind of the arts in general. But I didn't really have a handle on exactly what I wanted to do until maybe the middle of last year or so. So, I mean, a lot of this, the impetus for this came out of the work that I do for Ableton, which puts me in front of a lot of, a lot of rooms full of people that are, you know, getting their feet wet with electronic music or trying to learn production or interested in, in the gear. And the more I would do these presentations for people or teach in workshops or classes, the more I would meet people who had a pretty good handle on how the technology worked, but still had a problem finishing music. Right. And it occurred to me that there didn't seem to be a really strong correlation between level of technical knowledge, and ability to get music done. And I wanted to try to address the problem, like the sort of creative problems that plague producers in the studio without dealing with the technology at all, but dealing with it from purely the sort of musical and creative angle. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That makes, that's actually, makes a lot of sense. I'll bet you got a chance to see a lot of, lot of producers in trouble, so, that would put you in a good spot for sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>Yeah, I mean, it seemed to be that the creative crises that people had seemed to all over the technical levels. So from beginners to absolutely advanced people, they were all kind of facing the same kinds of problems. And I identified with these problems because they're the ones that I had too. So it was also kind of a therapeutic exercise to write a book like this. 'cause it got my, it got me to get sort of my own creative demons out on paper. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. So, I want to explore the book and the book ideas a little further, but before we do that, you are one of the people that I know that has a lot of skills in a lot of areas. So you're <span style="color:red" data-ts="306.605" data-end_ts="306.725" title="306.605" id=c_"306.605">__a__</span> great musician. You, you're a good educator. I think, I think that you are, a, a good speaker and a good person in front of the public. But you're also really skilled at music technology stuff. I'm curious where a person like this comes from. I, I always like exploring in my podcasts what people's backgrounds are that allow them to be the artists that they are. Yeah. I'd like to, I'd like to hear how you got to be who you are. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>Yeah. I mean, I guess it's, I guess with any of this stuff, it's some weird combination of nature and nurture. You know, my parents were both semi-professional musicians. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. My dad came from a kind of rock and progressive rock background as a guitarist, but he was also an electrical engineer and designed recording consoles and, and things like that, for a number of years in the seventies. And my mom also, was a guitarist and singer. So I kind of grew up in an environment with music anyway, and I grew up just outside of Detroit in the eighties. So this was a really interesting, there was some really interesting things happening there, right. That were the kind of proto techno world. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I didn't realize until I was much older that it wasn't normal for 12 and 13 year old kids from the suburbs to be listening to Kraft <span style="color:red" data-ts="385.645" data-end_ts="385.765" title="385.645" id=c_"385.645">__work__</span> and Tangerine Dream. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>Right. I thought everybody was doing that, but it was just that, that was the kind of stuff that was happening on the radio in Detroit then. So I had an interest in electronic music really early and ended up getting a DX seven when I was, you know, in, in junior high or something. I'm dating myself a little bit here, <laugh>, and, you know, did this kind of school band thing. But I didn't really have much in terms of a formal musical education until I got to college. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> I had, I played drums, you know, and that was my, that was my exposure in the band, but then I decided that <span style="color:red" data-ts="422.885" data-end_ts="423.005" title="422.885" id=c_"422.885">__I__</span> was some sort of quest for legitimacy, I guess, that I wanted to, to try to, to follow a, a kind of academic path a little bit more, even though I didn't really have much exposure to that world at all before I got to college. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>Sure. So I, you know, I had been writing music, but it was this weird sort of tangerine, dreamy, experimental electronic music. And so I, I, you know, I went into music school. I went to, Western Michigan University, which is a big state school in, in Michigan Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> in Kalamazoo, Michigan. And, I did a degree there in composition and music theory, and, you know, played in, played in a rock and funk band as a drummer for a while during that gig. And then I sort of reached a crossroads near the end of that degree where I had to decide, you know, was I as interested in pursuing, was I interested in continuing to pursue an academic education? Did I wanna make this drum set thing become a bigger deal? And I decided to go to grad school. So I did the, you know, the grad school application round, and I ended up, going to Yale to do a, a master's in composition. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>And then I was <span style="color:red" data-ts="493.735" data-end_ts="493.955" title="493.735" id=c_"493.735">__not__</span> really not doing any electronic music at all at that time. I, I played with it a bit in, in my undergrad. We had, you know, this was very early computer technology back then. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, so like versions of digital performer where you would set up a convolution process and then really go have lunch, maybe it would be done by the time you got back and it would probably sound terrible and you'd have to do it again. Right. But then I did a master's at Yale also in composition, and then I, I entered a doctoral program at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York, also in classical composition. And I got more back into electronic music then, because I was doing some teaching so that I <span style="color:red" data-ts="534.195" data-end_ts="534.395" title="534.195" id=c_"534.195">__got__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="534.435" data-end_ts="534.555" title="534.435" id=c_"534.435">__a__</span> graduate assistantship as a, as, you know, an instructor teaching in the electronic music lab for undergraduates. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>Sure. So that was a nice sort of introduction to teaching, a group of willing participants. Right, right. And also a nice way to get back into electronic music again. Yeah. And then I think I, maybe it was like another kind of rebellion moment. Somewhere in the middle of working on my doctorate, I started to feel the beginnings of like, burnout towards, right. Towards the academic music world and decided to, to play around with this music of my youth, this early electronic music stuff. So I made some, you know, what I thought at the time was techno and sent some demos out and ended up getting a small label deal with a label in Berlin and flying to Berlin doing some gigs. This was like the summer of 2001 and 2002. And eventually, like a lot of people do, you know, I went to Berlin for a couple months and ended up staying for two years. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>Sure. It's one of those things that happens to everybody, it seems, that goes to Berlin <laugh>. And that turned into a, a job, actually a native instruments as a sound designer. And, you know, kind of the rest is history. I, my wife and I moved back to, to the US in 2005, and I left the Native Instruments gig, but I was still doing adjunct teaching at a community college here. And I was playing in this new music chamber orchestra, also this group called Alarm <span style="color:red" data-ts="625.125" data-end_ts="625.325" title="625.125" id=c_"625.125">__Wolf__</span> Sound. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So I still very much had my feet in, in both of the, the kind of academic and the electronic and the very not academic electronic music worlds. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>You know, and I just, I had met the people from Ableton when I lived in Berlin, and when I was over there doing gigs, mostly because I found a bug in a very early version of Live, like, live One or something. Okay. And so, and they had trouble reproducing it. And so I spent some time in the office and, you know, I'd been friends with those guys for a long time. And as with the native gig, it kind of evolved into a full-time job at Ableton, which I officially started in 2007. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. That's quite a track. And, you know, I have to admit that there's a lot of, that I had absolutely no idea about <laugh>, but, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>It's a windy road for 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Yeah. I you're like the first person that I've talked to in these interviews, that kind of grew up around what has now become the mythical Detroit music scene. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>It's true. But at the time, I didn't even really notice it as being seen. It was just sort of in the air. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Yeah. You know, so I, I mean, for me, I read it and it's like, oh, Juan Atkins and, and these guys and science fiction reading and the Electrifying Mojo and all this kind of stuff, and it's really built itself up to be quite a myth or quite a mythological base. How much of that stuff is real, first of all. And secondly, what, what was it like the first time you realized that everyone else is listening to REO Speedwagon 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b><laugh>? Well, I mean, I guess I was listening to REO Speedwagon too. <laugh>, you know, I mean, the, my electronic music interests were, were very different than the kind of stuff that was normally played in our house. I mean, my dad was very much a rock and roll guy. Right. You know, and he, he was interested in jazz too. And, and that was an exposure that I had as well. But the Electrifying Mojo was, you know, for me, it, it didn't occur to me at the time that, that anything really big was happening. You know, and I, I, I was a kid from the Midwest. I didn't travel at the time, you know, as a, I guess a lot of people in the Midwest don't travel. And, and I certainly didn't as a teenager much. Right. So it didn't occur to me that there weren't radio shows like the Electrifying Mojo Show everywhere. Right. This was just my world, you know, and it really, I think it was maybe 15 years later that I started to figure out, oh, something really big happened back then. <laugh>, you know, it didn't, like, it wasn't weird to me to, to listen to REO Speedwagon with my dad in the car, and then here, you know, inner city on the Electrifying Mojo Show right at night when I got home. That was just the world I lived in. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So that's, that's crazy and amazing, really. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>Yeah. I mean, it's difficult for me to, I can't really put a finger on how much of the mythology is true and how much of it isn't, because there was a big break there for me. Like, I, when I went off to college, I was very much invested in the, you know, kind of powdered wig, studying Bach corrals, world <laugh>. And I, I wasn't really thinking so much about the techno influence at the time. It really wasn't until I was in grad school that I was like, you know, maybe I should try my hand at some of this music because it meant something to me as a kid. And I was missing this feeling of like the young vital interest in music that I had had back then. <span style="color:red" data-ts="831.735" data-end_ts="831.855" title="831.735" id=c_"831.735">__I__</span> mean, most of my musical experience at the time was spent sitting in front of finale or Sibelius. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So, now let me ask you something, and I will, I will start off by admitting, something from my past <laugh>, which is that, when I was growing up, I was, I, I was involved in music, you know, it wasn't pop music, it was, I was involved in bluegrass music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>Oh, cool. Nice. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Which has a lot of technique, but it's pretty light on music theory, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, then I went off and I did some other stuff, and then it was time to go to school, and I chose to go to North Texas because they were the only school at the time that had a jazz program. Right. And jazz seemed like the hard stuff. Right. <laugh>. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> To what extent, what was the driving motivation for you to go from, you know, whatever a kid does into, as you express the powder wig world of academic music? What was the impetus? Was it, was it like a puzzle you wanted to crack or was it a person you wanted to be? How, what do you think was the driving force there? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>I don't really know. I mean, it's, it's weird to think back on it, like, considering the kind of career trajectory I've taken, it doesn't really make a lot of sense. And as, as much as I'm not really in that world anymore, I wouldn't change anything. Right. You know, I, I don't know what, what it was about. I think part of it was a kind of personal validation thing. Like, I think I was pretty self-conscious about the fact that I was a, <span style="color:red" data-ts="926.485" data-end_ts="926.605" title="926.485" id=c_"926.485">__a__</span>, I was really involved and really invested in music, but for whatever reason, I had started quite late on the learning part of it. You know, I could, like, I started college and could barely read music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>And that, I think that was really, I was sort of freaked out and intimidated by that. And I felt like, well, if I really want to take this seriously, like this being a musician thing, I should probably learn some stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>And I think I, when I got into that world and, you know, started getting introduced to all this music that I had no idea about, like the second Viennese school and Ligety, and, you know, it was like, oh, wow, this is amazing. This is incredible music. And there's, there's a lot here that I can be invested in. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Sure. Now, in, in the work that you've done subsequently, how, what would you say are the things that you learned in, in school that you still use a lot today? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>Yeah, I mean, I think the, the being able to turn sound in your head into sound in the world, Uhhuh <affirmative> is probably the most valuable thing that I learned. Or being able to duplicate sounds that you hear, like, that was, I think a very valuable. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now are you talking about melodies, or are you talking about sound design? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>Well, I mean the, in the, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Or kind of both. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>A little bit of both. I mean, you know, from ear training and theory classes, you, you develop the ability to kind of reproduce sounds that you hear or, you know, melodic lines or harm harmonies that you hear, you know, and, and it's not very hard for me now to transcribe things that, that I hear, or quickly figure them out by ear or, you know, if I have something in my head, I can play it. And that's where I think training is really helpful, because if you have no, if you don't have any background, being able to put your hands on an instrument in a way that lets you play what's in your head, you can probably get there eventually. But it's gonna be this massive process of trial and error. Like, is this, is the second note higher or lower than the first note? You know, I, and not having to think about that stuff, I think just narrows the time window between getting stuff out that's in, which for me is the hard part. Right. Or, or at least in, in theory is the hardest part. Like, you have sounds that you either can imagine or that you've heard that you wanna reproduce, but it takes a long time to get that out. And, and I guess that's an upshot of this kind of training, is that it, it just makes that a faster process. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right Now, I have to admit that still to this day when I'm working on melodies and stuff, Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, when something goes from like a mid-range to a high range, I actually feel my throat tightening up as if I was still sight singing <laugh> those things. Right. Right. It's like some kind of like physical tick that I can't shake Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> that I picked up when I was in music school, and it's still there 20 years later. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>Sure. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1108.085" data-end_ts="1108.285" title="1108.085" id=c_"1108.085">__Yeah__</span>. You know, that's, I think that's in some ways really helpful to have. Yeah. I'm not in any way a person who says, oh, well, you're not a real musician, you're not legitimate if you don't have this kind of training. But I'm very thankful for it, even though I'm using it in, in somewhat unorthodox ways. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, I actually think that that's one of the interesting things about what you do, though. I, I sometimes get a little irritated by, this sense that the highly trained or, the highly trained person or the well <span style="color:red" data-ts="1138.125" data-end_ts="1138.605" title="1138.125" id=c_"1138.125">__stocked__</span> studio is the place where great work comes from. Totally. Because I really feel like if you look back over the last 30 years, every innovation in music has come from somebody doing the wrong thing in their mom's basement, you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>Know? Exactly. Sure. Or something. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, I, I, I shouldn't do this because I actually respect his work, but I still call it the Walter Syndrome, which is like, you know, if it doesn't have tubes, it can't be music. Right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and this kind of thing, that kind of like very Catholic way of thinking about music is something that, really, it seems like we have enough examples now of that breaking down that we should be alright. But it does still seem to hang around. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>I mean, I think things are better than they used to be. You know, when I read about the sort of Columbia, Princeton of the seventies. Right. You know, this was, you know, this predates me and you read about these, you know, if, if you were writing tonal music, then you were a pariah. And I, I think <span style="color:red" data-ts="1200.925" data-end_ts="1201.125" title="1200.925" id=c_"1200.925">__thing__</span>, you know, things were starting to get away from that, even when I was in school. And I don't have a lot of exposure to what's happening in the, in the conservatory system now, but it seems like things like pop music and even electronic pop music are being adopted into curricula now in ways that, that feels really fresh. Right. You know, I don't, I don't know if there's so much of a kind of high low divide anymore. I mean, maybe there is, but I think the people that, that are keeping that alive are gradually fading away and aging out. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Right. And hopefully losing influence. Well, the other thing that I notice, so I teach at a local university, one of the things I noticed there is that sort of like <span style="color:red" data-ts="1243.655" data-end_ts="1244.005" title="1243.655" id=c_"1243.655">__muted__</span> music and media art and that kind of culture Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> has actually infected a lot of different, areas of study. So not only is it something that's, you know, emerging out of the music school, but it's also emerging out of the art department. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And it's emerging out of like the weird wing of the computer science group. And, certainly the film studies people are, you know, it's, it's almost like there's been a, a citizen's revolt about composition and everyone's kind of in it now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Well, I mean, you know, I guess these, these, there's these tired cliches about things like the democratization of technology, and I mean, everybody knows this, the story about parts get cheaper and software gets cheaper, and it's so powerful now, and everybody can make music in their bedroom. And I guess it's kind of an old tired thing to say, but it's, I think that's really it, you know? <span style="color:red" data-ts="1299.835" data-end_ts="1300.125" title="1299.835" id=c_"1299.835">__Yeah__</span>. That, you know, I wrote about it in like, the first paragraph of the book that a 99 cent iPhone app now is like, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1308.805" data-end_ts="1309.045" title="1308.805" id=c_"1308.805">__most__</span> is as powerful as a million dollar studio was 30 years ago. Right. That's pretty incredible. And pretty hard to avoid, you know, <laugh>, it's no longer, you know, if you're a 13 year old kid, you have access to this incredible power. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, it's, I mean, all of this though, really does kind of open the door for what your book is, because reading your book, I was blown away by the breadth of what you put together. And it's funny because you actually have a chapter labeled breadth Before Depth. Right, right. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But your book goes is everything from like, you know, creative prods to sort of basic music theory and how to approach musical, you know, the techno the techniques of music creation to, you know, more creative prods, but then also like, you know, how do you do things? How do you apply stylistic behaviors? How do you get your own voice? I mean, it's all over the map, but in a very somehow cohesive way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>Yeah. I mean, that, that, that's good to hear that it's cohesive. It was kind of all over the map in my head. And I had these, I talk about the book as kind of progressing along these two sets of three axes. Right. The, the first one is what I identified as this sort of big stages in the composition process. Just how do you start from nothing? So problems of beginning, how do you make more material out of a little bit of material? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So for the problems <span style="color:red" data-ts="1398.325" data-end_ts="1398.445" title="1398.325" id=c_"1398.325">__of__</span> progressing, I mean, I think <span style="color:red" data-ts="1400.745" data-end_ts="1400.965" title="1400.745" id=c_"1400.745">__the__</span>, you know, people talk about the, the curse of the four bar loop, or I think one of my, one of my colleagues refers to the Ableton Loop graveyard. Oh, <laugh>. Which I think is like, it's such a beautiful and very sad, but very true thing that you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1416.795" data-end_ts="1417.085" title="1416.795" id=c_"1416.795">__that__</span> the tools make it so easy to create an amazing sounding four bar loop that you can listen to it for three hours and then realize that you don't have anything Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>Except four bars. And then finally like, how to round off at the end when you, when it feels like things should be done, but they're not quite done. You have the problems of finishing. And then the other axis of three is the kind of musical philosophy stuff that I talk about where I, I, I stake a position on the value of a particular way of thinking about the arts or, or about music. And then the psychology stuff, which is a lot of it is a kind of retooled, creative self-help sorts of things. You know, like sure. You're, you're stuck and you're afraid and you're intimidated, and here's how you can get out of those. And then, like you said, a little bit of very basic music theory. I wanted to try to take the music theory that I know and decouple it from the, the need to learn a ton of history and a ton of, you know, what I think is maybe not entirely relevant information for people that are just trying to get a basic handle on how harmony works. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That's, that's really interesting. But at the same time, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1492.905" data-end_ts="1493.125" title="1492.905" id=c_"1492.905">__how__</span>, I'm curious, how did you decide where to start? You know? Right. I mean, it's one of the, one of the issues with books of this type and, you know, we cycling obviously have struggled with sort of like the book thing as well, which is like, how basic do you, do you have to start? What knowledge do you assume people already have? How worried are you gonna be about shooting over somebody's head? And, and especially since this was produced, this, this was actually published by Ableton, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>That's right. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So I would think that they had to be kind of, they wanted to make sure that they didn't, transmit the thing of like, you know, you can't really use our products if you're, if you're not smart enough. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>Right. Actually, they were, Ableton as a, as an organization was remarkably hands <span style="color:red" data-ts="1546.745" data-end_ts="1546.965" title="1546.745" id=c_"1546.745">__off__</span> about this whole project. It was really very much a thing that I drove, with the understanding that they would publish it at the end, I assume, you know, unless it was a disaster <laugh>. Right, right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1558.365" data-end_ts="1558.645" title="1558.365" id=c_"1558.365">__Like__</span>, you know, when it was pretty much done. I shared it with everybody and, and got some really great feedback from a number of my colleagues, which I, I definitely think helped tighten it up Uhhuh <affirmative>. But, wait, what was the other part of your question? The first thing you asked was, oh, how to decide on a level. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. How do you decide on what to include and what to toss out? Because I mean, it would've been easy to say, Hey, we're gonna, we're <span style="color:red" data-ts="1582.245" data-end_ts="1582.445" title="1582.245" id=c_"1582.245">__gonna__</span>, focus on the creative insights part of this. Yeah. And hence, I don't need to tell you what a ninth <span style="color:red" data-ts="1588.655" data-end_ts="1589.005" title="1588.655" id=c_"1588.655">__court__</span> is. Right. Or conversely, you know, there aren't enough books yet. I don't think about saying you're a musician. You might want to know what a ninth chord is. So here, let me tell you a story. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>It was pretty much a kind of free association. And I <laugh>, I mean, I guess I have to make the same <span style="color:red" data-ts="1608.325" data-end_ts="1608.525" title="1608.325" id=c_"1608.325">__dec__</span> I write the manual for our products too, right. I write the, the, the manual for live and, and push. And so I have to make that same kind of decision like you're aiming at a particular hypothetical person, and you have to kind of imagine 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That is <span style="color:red" data-ts="1622.245" data-end_ts="1622.365" title="1622.245" id=c_"1622.245">__so__</span> do <span style="color:red" data-ts="1622.405" data-end_ts="1622.445" title="1622.405" id=c_"1622.405">__you__</span> where you do like stories about, you know, this person, you know, Craig is a, is a musician and Gary 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1629.345" data-end_ts="1629.565" title="1629.345" id=c_"1629.345">__Vi__</span> Yeah. I mean, we do, we do some of that internally when we're we're talking about product stuff. I didn't do that really for this. It was really more of a, a feeling. I see. I don't know. And I kind of tooled it as I went. And I imagine that, you know, as with anything that's just kind of felt like this, I probably got some of it Right. And I probably got some of it really wrong. And I'm sure that for any particular person who reads this book, there's probably gonna be at least one chapter where they say, well, this is really self-evident and dumb, and I know this. And there's probably gonna be at least one chapter where a lot of people are like, I don't understand this at all. It's way over my head. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, one, one of the things that was interesting to me is I, I purchased <span style="color:red" data-ts="1668.485" data-end_ts="1668.605" title="1668.485" id=c_"1668.485">__a__</span>, an electronic copy, a Kindle copy. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, it was on, you know, so it's a Kindle thing, so it shows up on all of my Kindle devices Yeah. Or Kindle capable devices. And it happened to show up on my wife's iPad. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And she was like, huh, I wonder what this is. And took a look. And she's a school teacher. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And she came back to me and was like, you know, a lot of these things are really useful, even outside of the music world, just from a creative, and especially the thing about getting started for her Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, she finds that with students of any type, if there's any intimidation at all, the getting started thing is just deadly. And then the finishing up thing is deadly because that's the point at which you have to expose yourself to criticism. Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b><affirmative> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And her insights on that were really kind of interesting because I wouldn't have thought to frame it quite that way because I am thinking of, you know, a guy trying to do a release. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>Right? Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And so it was interesting to hear it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>Yeah. I mean, it's great to hear, and I've heard that from a few other people too. And I, it's pure luck. Like I really wasn't aiming for a kind of general purpose book about creativity. I really wanted to, I mean, I love some of these books. Books like the War of Art, I think is amazing. And yeah. You know, think like an artist. These are great books and they're, they're quite high level, you know, they're looking at the problem of creativity from a, a kind of profession agnostic view, which I think is awesome. But I really wanted to make something that was very specifically for people making music with machines. Like not even just people making music, people making music with electronics, and recognizing that some of that stuff was gonna be more, you know, some of the things that I wrote would be more specifically about that, and some would be more general. But then I heard from, I think I heard from a choreographer and a theater director that, oh, yeah, there's some stuff in this book that I can make use of. And, it's great. It's really great to hear it was not the plan <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Okay. Yeah. I was, I was wondering again, because, you know, certainly I read a lot of those kind of artistic creativity books, and also I'm like an obsessive compulsive about like the creative card sets. You know, it started with the oblique strategies, but now it seems like there's a new one every two weeks, and I just have a stack of 'em. Right. I just, I just kinda love that interaction with something, but I was curious to, to see if, if there ha was an imagination for a bigger thing. And it's actually surprising that there wasn't. Although maybe that makes sense, because if you would've tried to be, you know, encompassing of everyone, it might not have hit any mark. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>Sure. Exactly. I mean, and also it's just not my world, like Right. I, I don't think of myself as being a generally creative person. <laugh>, I think of myself as, as very much in this kind of niche community, and I wanted to write for, you know, my people <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Right. So let's talk about your people a little bit. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I mean, how do you interact with, how do you interact with the world of musicians? Do you mostly do it like through the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1859.725" data-end_ts="1860.125" title="1859.725" id=c_"1859.725">__Ableton__</span> forums and stuff like that? Do you get out and shake hands and stuff? Do you still go to trade shows, things like that? How do you, how do you sort of get out of your basement? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>Yeah, it's interesting. I mean, I don't that much, you know, I'm a, I'm a new parent, which also, at least in the last nine months or so, that has really tied me down a lot more. Sure. But also, I'm like kind of old and boring, and I like to sit at home. And so I don't go to a lot of, I don't go to see a lot of live music, actually. So I miss a lot of the, the musical community that way. But I do a lot of, you know, presentations and going to music schools and Right. Little workshops and some Ableton stuff. I mean, I, I, I still go out and do presentations for Ableton quite a bit. But then after this book came out, I, I did something like a book tour this summer, which was this very ad hoc thing. I ended up in Berlin for all of June, but then from there ran out to the UK two weekends in a row to speak at festivals. And then I was at Sonar in Barcelona, and then I was back last week, up in Copenhagen for a day and then back down to talk to at school in Berlin for a day. So, I mean, I'm meaning a lot more people now that the book is out than I was. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I think that there's a di desire to have this kind of stuff available, you know, both, both by artists, but also, you know, I can speak for educators, man. Anything you can do to help when, when students come to you and say, I want to know more, or I want a creative jolt, or whatever. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know, it's, it's nice to have something that can say, here's something <span style="color:red" data-ts="1957.475" data-end_ts="1957.675" title="1957.475" id=c_"1957.475">__kinda__</span> focused on what you're into. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>Right. Yeah. I mean, that was the idea. And you mentioned the card decks. I mean, stuff like the oblique strategies was a huge influence on this. Yeah. But I wanted to, to solve the problem in a very different, in a non oblique way, in a kind of, you know, direct way. Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1974.805" data-end_ts="1974.925" title="1974.805" id=c_"1974.805">__I__</span>, what I love about oblique strategies is how it, it makes you have to think more. And what I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1980.765" data-end_ts="1980.925" title="1980.765" id=c_"1980.765">__want__</span> to do is kind of provide answers for people. Like if, if x then y 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That's, that's true. I mean, the oblique strategies are like the most significant case of, no answers, just questions. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>Sure. Which is beautiful. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Which is beautiful, assuming that you have a bucket full of answers laying around and waiting to be used. Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And so it's, again, it's, it's really great to see what you've done. So now I want to talk, about the practical reality of being Dennis DeSantis <laugh>, which is, so you're a musician with this long musical background. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And although you, you claim to not be out chasing around doing releases or performing or whatever, you still must have a Jones to do music, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>Yeah, sure. I mean, I, I'm, I'm still making music and I still occasionally release some of it, you know. Sure. I, I did a, I did some tracks for <span style="color:red" data-ts="2034.325" data-end_ts="2034.445" title="2034.325" id=c_"2034.325">__a__</span>, for a digital only label like a couple years ago, and one of them got picked up on a, on a compilation. So, you know, I'm still doing, I'm still doing stuff, and, but I mean, for now most of my activity is like putting up unreleased music on my SoundCloud page, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>And enjoying the, enjoying the handful of hits from 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2052.205" data-end_ts="2052.325" title="2052.205" id=c_"2052.205">__That__</span>. So I'm, I'm curious, because this is definitely a thing for me. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I'm curious to know, since you conceivably work with, musical software on a laptop computer Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> in the privacy of your home, that's your, that's your nine to five gig. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>How do you make it do <span style="color:red" data-ts="2073.885" data-end_ts="2074.005" title="2073.885" id=c_"2073.885">__not__</span>, not <span style="color:red" data-ts="2074.125" data-end_ts="2074.245" title="2074.125" id=c_"2074.125">__work__</span>? Working on music is not my nine to five gig. It's mostly writing text 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Actually. Okay. But still it's writing text while you're looking at a copy of Ableton live on a screen, I assume. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>Right. Exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So when it comes time to make music, do you still crack open Ableton Live? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>I do actually. And for, you know, for a, for a lot of people I know they, they talk about this wanting to get, get out of the computer to, to make music after they've been sitting in front of the computer all day. And I don't, I don't have such a strong urge to get away from the, the tool. I mean, live feels very much like my home studio. It's, it's where I'm perfectly comfortable making music. I, I get it. I mean, I get the, the desire to get out. And when I, when I work with Push for example, it's a very different kind of experience for me, like using push to, especially to do things that are not really considered push primary me, you know, mission to do things like create step sequence to automation. Right. For me that that's a fantastic way to work. It's much better than trying to use a mouse. Sure. I recently bought a synthesizer, the first hardware synthesizer I've bought in that I've had at all in many years. Okay. I bought an Electron Analog four. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, hilarious. And 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>I, I love it. It's really, really nice. And I really love the, the hands-on approach of that. Right. But between that and push, I'm, I'm pretty, pretty happy in the, in the tactile and, you know, my interest with those things. The reason I bought the analog for is not just that it sounds great and it's a fun experience, but because of Over <span style="color:red" data-ts="2168.685" data-end_ts="2168.965" title="2168.685" id=c_"2168.685">__Bridge__</span>, because of the promise of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2170.555" data-end_ts="2171.045" title="2170.555" id=c_"2170.555">__sinking__</span> the hardware with the studio environment that I'm comfortable in anyway. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. So have you gotten the Over bridge and have you gotten it running? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>Yeah, it works. It's amazing. Yeah. It's a's such a nice way to work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I was, you know, when it was first announced, I was, so, I, I'm not a huge electron guy. I happen to have an Okta <span style="color:red" data-ts="2188.205" data-end_ts="2188.365" title="2188.205" id=c_"2188.205">__track__</span>, which is my, my sort of like away from the computer home. But, it does not support, over <span style="color:red" data-ts="2196.725" data-end_ts="2197.005" title="2196.725" id=c_"2196.725">__bridge__</span>. Right. But when I first read about Over <span style="color:red" data-ts="2198.725" data-end_ts="2199.005" title="2198.725" id=c_"2198.725">__Bridge__</span>, at first I thought it was just like, you know, just one of those sort of data pipe things. And then I started reading about exactly all the different ways that you can make connections. And I was kind of blown away because it did seem to, what it seemed to me is it almost, instead of making the hardware work better with the computer, it's almost more like the computer got sucked over closer to the hardware side. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>Yeah. I mean, it feels like a very seamless relationship, which is really nice. And what I really like about it is you can, you can use it as deeply or as shallowly as you want to. So if I wanted to treat the analog four as just a tone generator, I could run everything from Live as if it was a soft synth, basically. Right, right. And never have to think about the electron workflow at all. On the other hand, I could sit on the couch with the analog four for five hours and then just bring it back to the computer and use the computer as a recording environment. Yep. And that, it's so nice to have that whole range of flexibility. Yeah. It's, but yeah, I mean, somehow or another, everything ends in, in Live for me, <laugh>, it's the, it's the, you know, it's home. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So when you're working in life, I mean, one of the things that I notice is that, and this is true with Max as well as with life, when you ask people to show you their working environment, they often kind of act like a little embarrassed. Like, well, you know, I, it's not as complex as you think, or whatever. Yeah. But what I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2287.805" data-end_ts="2288.045" title="2287.805" id=c_"2287.805">__notice__</span> is that, live has somehow put itself together in a way that it feels modular in that everybody has an idiosyncratic Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> an idiosyncratic work environment, meaning that there are, there are devices that they use all the time. Sure. There's something wacky they got off of Max <span style="color:red" data-ts="2310.705" data-end_ts="2310.925" title="2310.705" id=c_"2310.705">__for__</span> live.com that they and three other people use, but it's like critical to their system or whatever. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, what, what do you use, what, what are the things that you, that are your Go-to everyday tools? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>Yeah, interesting. Good question. I mean, I love the operator synth. That's a big part of my workflow. And I'm not even always using it as an FM tool. Sometimes it's just for, you know, having four separate oscillators that I can do fun things with. What I love about it is that it, it's just fast for me to do sound design with it. You know, starting from a, starting from a set of four sine waves, I can get somewhere pretty quickly. I'm also, I also use certain Max for live tools quite often the, the LFO so that I can modulate anything. Right. That's a pretty nice, I mean, live is pretty flexible in terms of how modulation works, but if you just want a knob somewhere to be wiggling Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, that creates such an interesting level of kind of indeterminacy. I really like that. And sometimes it's very subtle for me. It'll be, you know, a filter that wiggles with a little bit of jitter, so I don't quite know where it's gonna go mixed with some automation. Yeah, I don't know. It's not, there's not much more to it than that. I mean, the drum rack is a big part of my life, especially in conjunction with push just because of that. The drum workflow that's laid out on push is a big, is a big thing for me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Where do you get the samples that you, or, or do, do you use the senses or do you use samples? And where do you get the stuff that, that kind of represents the core of how you, you know, I'm just curious because I like thinking about how people assemble their workspace. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>Right. Yeah. It's a big mix of things. I mean, I have a huge sample library that I've just sort of collected over the years from, from the time that I worked at Native to, you know, sounds of my own that I've made and various things that I've picked up from other people along the way. I go to places like free <span style="color:red" data-ts="2447.745" data-end_ts="2448.625" title="2447.745" id=c_"2447.745">__sound.org__</span> and find little bits and pieces if there's something in particular I'm looking for. I mean, I have the problem now that I probably have so much stuff that it's easier for me to find things on the internet than it is for me to find them in my own library. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, free sound does certainly make that a viable option to that. Exactly. That site is amazing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>Yeah. It's great. You know, and often for me, it's a process of tweaking a sound for a while, resampling it, running it through some effects. Resampling it, again, the whole resampling workflow in live is something that's a big, a big part of my sound design process. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>I'm a big fan of committing to audio early and often so that you can get yourself away from, you know, knowing that you have thousands of knobs at your disposal. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. The, the, the ghetto of tweaky. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>Yeah. Right. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, well, we have already blown through the time. I thank you again for taking time outta your schedule. But one of the things I like to ask people, and especially when they have, a scenario like yours, you have a pretty interesting gig with a pretty interesting company doing all kinds of stuff. It seems really exciting. If there was some, if there was an 18 year old out there listening to this podcast that said, I want Dennis's life <laugh>, other than like, taking your life, which wouldn't be all that great <laugh>, my que what would you suggest as a maybe more efficient way of doing it? 'cause let's face it, I mean, the way that you and I got our jobs Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> doesn't really exist anymore. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>No, probably not. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2550.035" data-end_ts="2550.325" title="2550.035" id=c_"2550.035">__Yeah__</span>.

<b>Darwin: </b>And the way we got our education isn't the same as it exists now. Right. How would, how would you suggest somebody take on, you know, for sort of like this creative software, design development teaching, you know, it's a, it's a nebulous thing that we do. Sure. But it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2571.445" data-end_ts="2571.525" title="2571.445" id=c_"2571.445">__an__</span>, it's a pretty amazing thing to do. How would you suggest people prepare themselves for that kind of thing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>Yeah, I mean, it's a really good question. You know, I, I, it's, it's easy for me to think about where I see my own, weaknesses and think about, wow, if I really had that skillset together better, then I would be even better at my, at the life that I live. So, but, and those are the things that I would think to recommend to people. 'cause they're the things that I would recommend to myself as an 18 year old. Like, for example, I wish that I could code, you know, I wish that I could actually program this stuff. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I wish I had better max chops <laugh>, for example. My max programming skills are pretty limited. I've made little utilities that solve very specific problems for myself, but I'm not a, you know, I'm not a Christian <span style="color:red" data-ts="2619.005" data-end_ts="2619.325" title="2619.005" id=c_"2619.005">__client__</span>. I'm making beautiful synthesizers or, or any that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>I mean, I guess if to, to talk to that hypothetical 18 year old, it would be something like, don't put all of your eggs in one basket <laugh>, you know, don't, don't put on the powdered wig and commit yourself to, to, to a life in academic music. And at the same time, don't, you know, invest all of your money in drumsticks and think that you're gonna be the next great rock drummer. Like diversity and the, the ability to be happy in a life in music that is unpredictable is pretty valuable. I think another thing I'd recommend probably is to listen to the lots of different music. Like the more different stuff you're exposed to and, and really have thought about even things you don't like. I think the better you can communicate with people who are making stuff that's very different from you, and the more you learn about techniques and are exposed to, to a world of sound that may not be anything like what you're, what you're comfortable in sort of pushing against your comfort boundaries. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>And then I guess the last thing would just be, be cool with people. Like, I think a lot of the reason that I've been able to, to have gigs is not necessarily because of any kind of innate talent, but more that I'm, I try to be pleasant to work with. Right. You know, I think there's a lot of people who are, there's a lot of people in the arts who are kind of divas and who are sort of unpleasant and jerks. I just think, yeah. Jerks. And I hate working with jerks <laugh>, even if they're awesome, like working with jerks, is it? You need to be really awesome to overcome being a jerk. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Wow. Some incredible advice <span style="color:red" data-ts="2725.875" data-end_ts="2726.165" title="2725.875" id=c_"2725.875">__here__</span>. <laugh>. Dennis, I wanna thank you so much for your time. This was amazing. I hope that, sales of the book continue to blow up. I mean, the first one sold out like in 12 seconds or something. The first Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>It was pretty quick. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But I hope people get a chance to get their hands on it. It's, it's amazing. Thank you so much for everything you do and for being on this podcast. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>Yeah, thank you very much. Happy to be here. Alright, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well I'll catch you soon. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dennis: </b>Okay. Take care. Bye-Bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That wasn't that awesome. Dennis is an amazing guy. Someone who, whose work I've always really respected, but, like he says, he also is an easy guy to work with. And man, that goes a long way. I want to thank everybody for listening, for continuing to, support the podcast by sharing it with friends, family and everyone else. If you have any ideas for further interviews, if you yourself, think you might be a good subject for it, drop me a line at ddg@cyclingseventyfour.com and we'll go from there. The other thing is I would, say that if you're into, max and you're into physical modeling, take a look@themixology.club site, something that I, and a couple of other dedicated knuckleheads at cycling 7 74 put together. And we just finished up a revamp of the Percolate physical modeling objects. Amazing stuff. You heard me talk about it last week with Dan Truman, but, I just, I can't talk enough about how cool it is. So take a listen to that. Otherwise, I will see you next week. Bye.
