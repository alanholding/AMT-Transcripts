<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today we have, an opportunity to talk to somebody who's been in contact for quite a while, but I've never chatted with him. His name is, Tobias <span style="color:red" data-ts="24.255" data-end_ts="24.605" title="24.255" id=c_"24.255">__Raper__</span>. I think I only slightly butchered the English pronunciation of it. I'll let him kind of give you the full scale on the pronunciation, but he's a, he's an artist with an incredible, discography. He's doing some really interesting work. He's worked with a lot of interesting people, and I've been, I, I did some looking and I decided I really needed to talk to him. So with that, I introduce you to <span style="color:red" data-ts="50.675" data-end_ts="50.965" title="50.675" id=c_"50.675">__Tobi__</span>. Hey, man. How's it going? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tobias Reber: </b>Hi, Darwin. Nice to talk to you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So, you kind of mentioned that there's a couple of pronunciations of your name. Could you just give us like what your preferred pronunciation is? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tobias: </b>Actually, Tobias is fine. That's what all my English speaking friends call me. And I'm Swiss. So in, in my dialect, it's called Tobi. Okay. But most of my friends either call me Tobias, which is the, the German pronunciation, or Tobias, which is what people usually <span style="color:red" data-ts="83.885" data-end_ts="84.005" title="83.885" id=c_"83.885">__are__</span> English. Yeah. Say in English. Yeah. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>When I look at your site, which will be in the show notes, when I look at your site, you have an incredibly long discography, both of your own projects and projects that you work with other people. So instead of trying to list those, I'm gonna ask you to just kind of like, tell me what you consider sort of your, like, like your current and active work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tobias: </b>Well, my main artistic work at the moment is my, the work that I'm doing with Puli, which is a cross media performance group working from Zurich, Switzerland. And we are currently, working in the beginning stages of a new production, which will premiere in November. And that's what I've been doing for the past couple of weeks, <span style="color:red" data-ts="131.865" data-end_ts="132.085" title="131.865" id=c_"131.865">__ma__</span> mainly, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I mostly saw that from the videos that are on the site, it looks like <span style="color:red" data-ts="137.085" data-end_ts="137.205" title="137.085" id=c_"137.085">__a__</span>, a incredible production. It's like a, it's multi, it's multimedia in the old school way, which is like a lot of stuff on a stage with a lot of production, <span style="color:red" data-ts="148.525" data-end_ts="148.645" title="148.525" id=c_"148.525">__a__</span> lot of production action. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tobias: </b>Yes. It's the real thing. It's literally, it's the place where we try out everything we're interested in and we find ways to, to use it and incorporating, but we're also not shy to throw things out and use it in a later production. But you're right, it's very production intensive. There's video projections, there's, musicians, actors involved. There's, me who is kind of the media art, life electronics samples and Foley person in the group. And it also depends, we're also doing installations and we have also done film remixes live on stage where the video artist is remixing the, the, the film. Oh, okay. So the visual side and the musicians and actors are recomposing and reacting the movie or telling the movie in a different way than the movie version itself does. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's really interesting. Now, how many people are involved in that project? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tobias: </b>The, the project was founded by Thomas Fisher and Julia <span style="color:red" data-ts="213.615" data-end_ts="213.965" title="213.615" id=c_"213.615">__Morph__</span>, who are also the leaders of the project. I don't know what the, the right word in English would be, but, the, the cost is actually changing. There are people who have been involved for almost every project, and then there are people who are there for just one specific role in the project. So in, in the current production, there's an actor, an actress, a dancer. There's me doing the sound, and then there's <span style="color:red" data-ts="240.695" data-end_ts="241.045" title="240.695" id=c_"240.695">__Yulia__</span> doing the video part, and there will be four people on stage. Okay. Plus then you have the, the, director, you have a light person and the sound engineer. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, in addition to that, where I first actually ran across your work was the trio that you were doing with Marcus Reuter. That's where I actually first ran across you, you being part of a, a group. So I've always kind of been interested Oh, interesting. The things that he's, that he's done. Right. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> is that, that's the Centro <span style="color:red" data-ts="272.635" data-end_ts="272.925" title="272.635" id=c_"272.635">__Zoom__</span> group, right? Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tobias: </b>Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>First of all, why don't you talk a little bit about what that group is about? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tobias: </b>Well, the group is actually much older than I was almost gonna say, than I am, but that's not true. <laugh> <laugh>. But the group has existed for 20 years, and I've been a member for close to nine years, I would say. Okay. I knew about Marcus from a German guitar and Bass magazine called <span style="color:red" data-ts="296.045" data-end_ts="296.445" title="296.045" id=c_"296.045">__Italian__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="296.745" data-end_ts="296.965" title="296.745" id=c_"296.745">__Bus__</span>, where they ran an interview with him, I think around 2001 or two. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And then I, went to a class he was teaching, and we became, he became my teacher, and then we became friends and we started working together, and then they asked me to join the group, which had been a duo at that point, but which had been a trio for a while, featuring a singer, but I'm not singing, so I just did electronics as well. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And we've been working on and off. It's, it's not a project that's continually active, but we do an album every couple of years and we play some shows. Marcus and Barnhard have also played the Dual us tour last fall, which I couldn't be part of. And so it's a very <span style="color:red" data-ts="340.355" data-end_ts="340.645" title="340.355" id=c_"340.355">__flex__</span>, flexible, thing, and we just try to get in some work here and there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's a really interesting group too, because it's, what you don't often see is guitarists that are comfortable working like that kind of environment. And so in that you, there's like two guys on laptops and one guy <span style="color:red" data-ts="359.605" data-end_ts="359.725" title="359.605" id=c_"359.605">__on__</span> guitar. How does, how do you play, how do you get like the interplay between musicians when it's that kind of instrumentation? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tobias: </b>By listening? I would say. So it's, it's really all improvised. We also know each other well enough that we kind of know where we all are going. And it's not, we don't usually call it free improvisation, but it's rather like a real time composition. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tobias: </b>Approach, I would say, where we, we kind of know where we're heading with a piece and there's, you know, we're not afraid to use cliches or to like fall into a fixed groove and go from that and jam on that, but then it's, there's also things that are really free and noisy and all that. So it's, it differs from project to project, and we've also started to change our setups without telling each other so that we're just, we're surprising each other when we play. And I would say one of the main things that's distinguishing Centro <span style="color:red" data-ts="423.085" data-end_ts="423.285" title="423.085" id=c_"423.085">__Zoom__</span> from a lot of improvised electronics is that we are working heavily with harmony. So we, we just throw in chords and free tonal structures and create clusters that way, which sometimes are grinding against each other very heavily, and sometimes they're perfectly, mellow. And, and we, like, we like improvising with that as well. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's kinda interesting that you say that because that is, that is sort of like one of the secrets of, of sort of the improv experimental thing, which is as long as everyone stays away from cords, you're not gonna get too bad of a train wreck. Right? Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tobias: </b>Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But, so you're kind of walking on the high wire in order to introduce harmony into the game at all. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tobias: </b>Yes. <span style="color:red" data-ts="471.745" data-end_ts="471.965" title="471.745" id=c_"471.745">__And__</span> that's actually one of the cradles of the group that we are, you know, one of our slogans is we invented the wrong notes, which can be understood both ways that we actually invented them, but also that we tried to invent notes, but we invented, invented the wrong ones. Right. So we are, we, we play a lot with humor and with word play. We're all very interested in that because we're all speaking English a lot, but the, the other two guys are German, I'm Swiss, so I, I speak German, but it's still a foreign language, even though it's similar to my mother tongue. And a lot of weird misunderstandings happen that way, and we just constantly, celebrate that. And that's, I think that's also, you know, in the, the whole way that we think about what we're doing, that that's in there as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Now, I, I hate to do just sort of like a list of all your projects, but I was kind of surprised at the breadth of them because another thing that you do in a similar but kind of completely different vein is something called Blast Unicorn. Yes. Which is another collaboration with guitarist, right? Yes. In listening to it, it seems like you have maybe like an inner Prague rock person that's trying to get out <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tobias: </b>Yeah, definitely. I think that's, that's actually, kind of where I'm coming from. I was a guitar player as a teenager, and I listened to a lot of nineties Pro Rock is probably what you would call that. So bands like Green Theater and <span style="color:red" data-ts="563.255" data-end_ts="563.605" title="563.255" id=c_"563.255">__Spoke__</span> Beard and things like that. Right. And then I kind of moved towards jazz and free improvisation and things like that. But I've always been interested in, you know, bands like King Crimson and Projects, kind of from the King Crimson orbit, which is also what Marcus and Benhart are heavily involved in. Right. And, so that's definitely an, an influence. And with, Alex Stowe, who is my collaborator in Blast Unicorn, he's more of a straight up guitar player, but he's also an improviser and he's, he's very much into heavy metal music and bands like <span style="color:red" data-ts="602.095" data-end_ts="602.445" title="602.095" id=c_"602.095">__Shuga__</span>, which I also love. So <span style="color:red" data-ts="604.425" data-end_ts="604.645" title="604.425" id=c_"604.425">__in__</span> Blast Unicorn, it's kind of the meeting of those two worlds, I would say the freeform electronica and quirky composition stuff and the, the heavy metal stuff <span style="color:red" data-ts="616.925" data-end_ts="617.365" title="616.925" id=c_"616.925">__meeting__</span> program drums. So it's, it's kind of the, a fusion of all that. And it's obviously very playful and over the top. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And then kind of like on the opposite side of things is your solo work. I got a chance to listen to, your Cola album as well as, it looks like it's pronounced, it's, it's like, should be collapse, but it's got that same KOLA on the front, so I don't know, maybe you call it cola apps or something. But which that, which is a bunch of remixes of the work. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> from Cola, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tobias: </b><affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now to me, where the Blast unicorn stuff is really strongly on the, on the, almost like Prague Rock <span style="color:red" data-ts="658.355" data-end_ts="658.645" title="658.355" id=c_"658.355">__side__</span>, the cola stuff seemed to be on, you know, not ambient per se, but kind of like the variance of ambient that, that has interesting percussion. It came across really as a, as almost percussion composition, you know, in, in the way that you were using, using TAVRs in that thing. And that seems like it seemed very different from all the other work that you're involved in. To me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tobias: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, it's interesting that you mentioned ambient music, because that's actually at one point what I described it, how I described it is ambient percussion, uhhuh <affirmative>, because to me it ha it really has the feeling of an ambient record, but it's, it's almost exclusively percussive sounds. Yeah. Yeah. And it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="704.335" data-end_ts="704.685" title="704.335" id=c_"704.335">__color__</span> is a work that happened really quickly. I composed or I generate pieces within three evenings of working at home. And, so it's easy to, add conceptual baggage in hindsight, but that's actually not what it was. But, so the, the, the, the project happened just by fiddling around with a max patch, which is a kind of a step sequencer, which I've been developing over a couple of years, in which I've used in various projects in one form or another. And I've also, used it to trigger melodic sequences. And, so I'm sending <span style="color:red" data-ts="742.895" data-end_ts="743.185" title="742.895" id=c_"742.895">__midi__</span> messages to synthesizers, plugins, software synthesizers. And then just one evening I tried to use the melody generators with microtonal percussion, and that's what happened. And I started tweaking and I started recording, and I just composed about 10 pieces, I think over three nights, and seven or eight of them made it onto the album. So it wasn't a planned thing at all. It was pretty improvised, but it was a one point in a very long process of developing that software. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So now my question is, we have this really wide, wide array of different kinds of things that you do. Where where are you coming from that you feel comfortable in all of these, all of these areas? You know, one of the things I like do in my podcast is talking to people about their background, but especially when somebody is able to sort of like, exist in these experimental and then maybe ambient and maybe prish and, you know, all these different <span style="color:red" data-ts="807.555" data-end_ts="807.905" title="807.555" id=c_"807.555">__genre__</span> genres and, and you seem very comfortable in all of 'em, what, where, what's your background that puts you in a place to, to have those kind of interests and abilities? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tobias: </b>I, I would say at the, at the most basic, it's really just the love of music. I remember from a very early age on that. I, you know, I started noticing when I would have goosebumps when listening to music, and that's kind of been a compass of mine. And that just happened with a lot of musics. I've never really been one to define myself if I wasn't being forced to. So I listened to a lot of rock music as a teenager. I, I used to play Eric Clapton guitar solos on, on the electric guitar, but I was also interested in jazz. I was, as I said, interested in progressive rock. I really liked the idea of odd meters and like the kind of epic composition approaches that these, folks used. And, through that I got into classical music a bit more, and it's really just been a process of discovery. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tobias: </b>And, and I, I, I just find very interesting approaches and, and methods and aesthetics in, in a lot of places. So later on I started to, I, I studied music and media arts in <span style="color:red" data-ts="887.735" data-end_ts="888.015" title="887.735" id=c_"887.735">__Berlin__</span>, and I had a very good history of music class that I was taking for two years, and I discovered Renaissance music, and that's kind of blew me away. And then it, it's just, there's, I just added more and more and more things to the, to my palette. And it's not that I can do all of that, but I think all of that is in there. And as much as I like bands like Sun or Shuga or opec, I, I listen to burial and I listen to Renaissance Boku music all in the same day. And mm-Hmm. I think Marcus and Bernhardt who have really been very influential on me, they're kind of the same, although they're both very different musical personalities, I would say. We, we just share that, curiosity about what music is doing to us and what we are experiencing when trying out all these different approaches and the, the music that results from that. So I, I could never have imagined Cola before I composed it. And that's, that's kind of why I'm interested in algorithmic approaches so that I can really follow my intuition and try to formulate it in a Max patch, for example, and then still surprise myself and actually create music that I think is new to me, and that I like listening to myself. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's really interesting. I, I like the way that you talk about, about, you know, all of these different kinds of musics <span style="color:red" data-ts="978.525" data-end_ts="978.645" title="978.525" id=c_"978.525">__as__</span>, as being influential, because I think sometimes there's this sense where people want to hear that you studied, you know, you studied something and learned all the notes of them, or if you say you're a jazz player, that, that you sat down and listened to, all the Charlie Christian solos and learned those. Or if you are a, renaissance vocalist that you went back to the old documents and, and learned all the shape singing and stuff like that. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> whatever. It's, right. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But I like the way that you talk about this almost that as it's a subliminal influence rather than being one that's a direct result of study. Is that, am I getting that right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tobias: </b>Yeah, I think so. And, so I, I, I hear what you're saying in that I've always, and I still feel the problem of knowing how to do things as one on one hand being a necessity to learn to grow. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> to, to master a skill. But on the other hand, if you, you know, if you really can play all the scales at a very fast speed, you are very likely to do so and to apply that skill <laugh>. And that can be good if you're a bebop player, but it can be a problem when you're trying to find new style. And for me, that's, as I said, the, you know what, when I discovered Max, for example, that was such a huge shift in my thinking, and it took me a couple of years to realize that, that it was actually possible to not just imitate my heroes because I never finished songs because I, I always thought they sounded like a bad mix of my three favorite musicians at that time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tobias: </b>So with Max, I started to, and I realized it sounds like a commercial, but so be it, I realized that I could actually abstract my knowledge into rules and then see how those rules play out to generate music that was actually mine in a way. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> that, that I came up with, but which actually surprised myself. And where I did couldn't immediately point to the two or three major influences I am all for studying, you know, I, I loved studying music theory. I, very much think that you should know the history of music if you want to find something new, but at the same time, you need to develop that confidence to listen to your intuition and then find a way to not, not forget all, you know, which is a cliche thing to say, but to find ways to surprise yourself. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, the, the idea of using Macs to develop little systems, that, it's an interesting way to think of it, that, that what you're trying to do is sort of like embed your knowledge, but still give, have the system allow you to surprise yourself. You know, generative systems can be all over the place. They can be, you know, you turn on a thing and music just squirts out. And on the other hand, it can be like a thing with 5,000 knobs, which allow you to adjust everything, which just makes it a very complicated instrument. Right. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, where on that scale do you find comfort? Do you like to have lots of control, or do you have relatively few controls? Because, because you know that that too then applies how much setup you have to do ahead of time on the kind of music that you're trying to create. Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tobias: </b><affirmative> it really depends on the context that I'm working in. So first I think we should distinguish between live playing and fiddling around at home. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, so <span style="color:red" data-ts="1189.525" data-end_ts="1189.885" title="1189.525" id=c_"1189.525">__Kohler__</span>, for example, is very much a thing where I just stumbled upon something and then tweaked it until it sounded right. And then I just recorded 10 minutes of, of that. Okay. And in the patch that I'm using there, there's no chance at all. So if I've implemented the, the reset feature right, then it should play the same piece every time you press play. So there's, it's just permutations and lots of filtering of notes and I see, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1217.445" data-end_ts="1217.685" title="1217.445" id=c_"1217.445">__okay__</span>. But it's all cycles <span style="color:red" data-ts="1219.765" data-end_ts="1220.005" title="1219.765" id=c_"1219.765">__based__</span> and rules based. There's no, no chance in there. Got it. But then in other projects, especially if you're playing live, I think as a, you have that, that same old problem of digital electronic music, that nothing is possible and unless you define it, and I like to keep my setups pretty open, so I, let's say I have a granulator patch, I try not to have too many restricting features on how I use it so that I, I can decide in the moment how I want to play it, but then you also have to define which, which parameters you wanna control with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1254.645" data-end_ts="1254.765" title="1254.645" id=c_"1254.645">__a__</span> external controller. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tobias: </b>So there's, there's always, it shifts from project to project. I can't really give a definite answer. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Especially in the use of chance. Is that something that you embrace her playing live? 'cause especially when you're working in a collaborative thing, when you're working with two other people on stage, or, you know, in some cases more chance it can be risky in a fun way, but it can also be risky in a not very useful way. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tobias: </b>Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I mean, so how often do you find yourself allowing chance to happen in a live environment? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tobias: </b>Well, I think as soon as you're interacting with other people, you, you can't avoid a certain degree of chance. But then you could, you could say that's not really chance, that's just interactions and understandings and misunderstandings. And for example, in Roon, we try to use those in a productive way. But as for the setup that I'm using, I, it, it depends. I haven't really been an improviser in the classic sense for a long time. But with Roon, it's, it's really one of the things that I really love about this group is that everything's possible in the sense that everything's allowed. So we, we come up with weird things, and it might sound bad for the first 15 minutes, but then we find something that works and we record it. And even, even in, gigs, I would say when we play a tour, it might just sound very different from one night to another. And I, I don't really use chance operations, like the chance object, the random objects or anything, similar things in my patches, but I like to have these kind of uncontrollable elements. It, it always, I think, depends on which levels of composing or playing you apply them. If you have a, if, if you apply them on a large structural level, like for example, which synth sound you want to use, that's a very different thing than when you have some randomness in the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1375.725" data-end_ts="1375.965" title="1375.725" id=c_"1375.725">__note__</span> velocity that you're reducing. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, if that makes sense. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, it does. What it means though, is that, what it sounds to me is that you almost develop, an instrument for each sort of performance environment you have. And there's, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1393.665" data-end_ts="1393.885" title="1393.665" id=c_"1393.665">__and__</span> among people who work with Max or reactor or Super Collider in some of these systems, I tend to see two different kinds of people. One set of people defines a, a great instrument that they use for all of the performance environments. And sometimes that means they might exclude certain kinds of performance because it doesn't fit their instrument. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tobias: </b>Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative> in other cases, like yourself, I think it's almost like you design an instrument that's purpose built for each performance, you know, whether it's a recording or a live environment. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you create a specific instrument for that and, and kind of purpose build it for that specific role. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1442.305" data-end_ts="1442.525" title="1442.305" id=c_"1442.305">__Yes__</span>. Is that fair? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tobias: </b>That's absolutely correct. And I do wish sometimes that I had my instrument that I'm playing and where I develop kind of fluency like I had on the guitar. Right. But on the other hand, it's just in my, in the way that I work, you know, working with very different groups, it's also not even possible to just keep the same setup from project to project within one group. Say for, for example, with Pulp <span style="color:red" data-ts="1469.945" data-end_ts="1470.165" title="1469.945" id=c_"1469.945">__Mar__</span>, it's always a combination of Ableton live with many different controllers, sensors, microphones, varying amounts of microphones, sending me signals to do various kinds of things. Integrating Macs for various kinds of users. So it's always the, the setup, the instrument is being built during the rehearsal phases and between rehearsals and it's developing right until one week before the premiere, I would say. So for the, for the new project where I'm the only musician, I have to kind of take care of things that I'm not used to taking care of, and I have to find new ways of being a performer and new ways of integrating all of that in my setup. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tobias: </b>Because I also have two different computers on stage, and I have various places on stage where I have to be to play because of scenic performance reasons. So I also have tablets from which I have control things. And it's always, it's always a work in progress. And with, with, the other groups, it's partly that as well. But also I just like to try out new things and I, I don't wanna confine myself to one instrument, but I also don't build my instruments in a way that would require me to be a virtuoso player of them. That's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What I was going to ask. I was ask, I was <span style="color:red" data-ts="1555.405" data-end_ts="1555.605" title="1555.405" id=c_"1555.405">__gonna__</span> ask if you're, if you're constantly changing instruments, how do you attain any kind of facility on 'em beyond the most basic thing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tobias: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So in the creation of your instruments, do you build like functions that kind of assist you in doing things properly, <laugh>? Or how do you, how do you use the instrument then to facilitate a specific performance? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tobias: </b>Well, it depends again, with, polmar, we are always working, you know, creating the whole piece over many months. And I built my setup around that. And when the performance is ready to be played live, there's improvisation in the way that I may react to a dancer differently each night or to a performer. But the whole piece in itself is fixed and I'm playing at this point, I'm really playing a 90 minute composition. Got it. And so I have my buttons on my tablet ready to trigger the right thing at the right moment. And there is, I think there is a kind of virtuosity in that, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1620.865" data-end_ts="1621.085" title="1620.865" id=c_"1620.865">__in__</span>, you know, keeping all that stuff in my head and knowing when to be where. And <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Tell me about it. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1627.035" data-end_ts="1627.325" title="1627.035" id=c_"1627.035">__Well__</span>, it's, it's funny that you say that because I have found that I have a really weird quirk, which is that if I have to wait to press a button until a specific time, I'll get like, itchy fingers. And it's hard for me not to press the button early. There have been so many instances where I've like, just like lost patience and like, twitched my finger and hit the button, you know, <laugh>, it's like, it's, there's almost like a virtuosity just in terms of like freaking waiting, you know, <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tobias: </b>Yeah, that's true. That's why the, all these controller things are very tempting, but then there's also the matter of interplay. You know, you just have to find the right moment, which is what I think is a classical thing that musicians have to learn that when, when it's the right moment to do what you want to do. For example, on Sunday we had a rehearsal with just the actress and me. We, we tried doing the, the bleep sound on certain words. That's, so let's say she was talking to herself and cursing. Right. And I tried to bleep out all the, the curses <laugh> and also mute her microphone signal at the same time. And I, I was always early <laugh>, and you just have to relax into allowing yourself to not think <span style="color:red" data-ts="1701.025" data-end_ts="1701.245" title="1701.025" id=c_"1701.025">__too__</span>, too much about it and just find, find the groove. And we, it took us 20 minutes until we had that. So that's, that's one of the preparatory exercises because, 'cause I, I think there's gonna be some, some life censoring of her words in the file performance. That's, that's, so that's an example. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's, that sounds pretty fun. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tobias: </b>It's, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>In terms of, the, your interface with the computer now, I've seen some video, I think it was with Roone that, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1730.295" data-end_ts="1730.645" title="1730.295" id=c_"1730.295">__where__</span> you're using like a Barringer BCR controller. You mentioned here that with the Pope noir, you, have tablets that you're using sort of as an interface. What are your favorite interfaces and why do you choose them? You <span style="color:red" data-ts="1745.445" data-end_ts="1745.485" title="1745.445" id=c_"1745.445">__know__</span>, in terms of 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tobias: </b>Controller 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Tools? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tobias: </b>Yeah. Yeah. I would've to say it's, it is the BCF from Beringer. So the one with, with faders. Ah, okay. And I love that just because it's so big and I can really, you know, it, it fits the hands well, I think. And it's, it's in a way it's a bit clumsy almost, but it's, I really like, like to play with that. And I've had it for almost 10 years, I'd say. And, I originally bought it because I was doing a small installation where I was actually using the fa the faders, which you can automate Mm-Hmm. To trigger, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1783.515" data-end_ts="1783.805" title="1783.515" id=c_"1783.515">__hell__</span> egg holders. So <span style="color:red" data-ts="1785.645" data-end_ts="1785.885" title="1785.645" id=c_"1785.645">__that__</span>, like when you have a breakfast egg and you put it inside this, thing. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1790.285" data-end_ts="1790.485" title="1790.285" id=c_"1790.285">__Yeah__</span>, egg. Egg, yeah. Yeah. Egg cups. Yeah. I had four of those metallic ones. And I used sticks, chopstick to, trigger to play them like a, a xlophone. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tobias: </b>Okay. And so that, that's why I bought the BCF, but I've used it ever since. And as for the other things I like, I like touch OSC on the iPad. I have a iPad <span style="color:red" data-ts="1813.065" data-end_ts="1813.285" title="1813.065" id=c_"1813.065">__too__</span>, which is getting old by now, but I almost only use it for touch C and I build all kinds of interfaces on that. I use like PlayStation controllers. I have quite a few nano control fader boxes by cork that I'm using. And it, it varies from project to project again, for, for this new production with pulp, we're trying a lot of things and we we're trying out different kinds of sensors and accelerometers to do stuff, like to trigger sounds with body movements. And it's, again, it's the whole range depending on the project. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Well, now it's interesting you say that you're gonna be using sensors and all that kind of stuff. 'cause the other thing I noticed on your website is that you had, you've done a fair number of installation works and they all look like they're sort of sound art related installations. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So I'm really intrigued by, I'm really intrigued by that. And you know, to, to some extent you went outside of the typical com computer tooling to do these <span style="color:red" data-ts="1883.065" data-end_ts="1883.285" title="1883.065" id=c_"1883.065">__stu__</span> this stuff. You had to, because you know, most people aren't doing percussion works with solenoids firing against a, a hard wall. Right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So I'm curious about like both in terms of working with sensors and weird sonic actuators. Did you get into that at school or is that just something that fell into your lap? Or, and, and how do you do sound art installations? I haven't gotten a chance to talk to a lot of people that, that have a, that do sound art installation work. And I'm just curious how you get attention for that work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tobias: </b>As for the attention thing, I have no idea. And I have to admit that as you see, my website is very <span style="color:red" data-ts="1929.425" data-end_ts="1929.645" title="1929.425" id=c_"1929.425">__old__</span>. It's still on the, like looking the way it did when I made it in 2011 or whatever. And the most of the installations documented there were done when I was still studying music and media art, what is, what the program is called. Okay. And I did try out a lot of things. So, you know, doing a, a sound installation with a photosensor, photo vol type sensors Okay. And doing the percussion thing, and it was a matter of really experimenting. And I didn't really do sound installations for a couple of years until 2014 when I did a piece for the 500th anniversary of the church building in the town where I grew up. Okay. And, but that wasn't an interactive piece. It was generative in that it was a 24 hour soundscape generated from recordings of the church spells. Okay. But it wasn't reacting to the audience or anything. Right. And I have only started using sensors again with, pulp <span style="color:red" data-ts="1993.635" data-end_ts="1993.855" title="1993.635" id=c_"1993.635">__Mar__</span> or various kinds of these kinds of triggers. But even, even with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1997.855" data-end_ts="1998.135" title="1997.855" id=c_"1997.855">__<inaudible>__</span>, we're not doing interactive installations. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, it's something that I want to get back into, but at this point I have no right to call myself <span style="color:red" data-ts="2005.655" data-end_ts="2005.775" title="2005.655" id=c_"2005.655">__a__</span> sound artist, I would say. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's interesting. Because some of the work is really pretty compelling looking. So, it's interesting that that was done while you were in your studies. That's, that's cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tobias: </b>I would probably say that I did work pretty hard when I was studying. I really made a point of trying out everything that I could, I felt to be, felt it to be a real privilege to be able to study that kind of work for five years and, you know, having to pay almost nothing. You, I don't know if you know that, you know, university education is basically free here. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, I know. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tobias: </b>Yeah, I know. I've no idea what kind of life I would be leading right now if I had all that debt. So I think, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2049.895" data-end_ts="2050.015" title="2049.895" id=c_"2049.895">__I__</span> think that's, I, and I was aware of that because I had friends in other parts of the world at that time already, and I, was like at every point in my, during my studies, I was aware of the privilege that I had, not, not only of being accepted to study there, but just to be able to have access to all those persons. I had really fantastic teachers and, mentors, you know, at the same time, people like Marcus who taught me a lot kind of as a second parallel thing to the studies, to the formal studies. I, I was just very lucky, I guess. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>True enough. Since you are based in Switzerland, it's, it's interesting to talk to people about what things are like. I, I don't think of, I don't think that people think of Switzerland necessarily as a center of a lot of, a lot of media activity. It's not, you know, I think when people think of like European hotspots for music and music and sound work and stuff, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2108.845" data-end_ts="2109.135" title="2108.845" id=c_"2108.845">__when__</span> thinks of like London and Berlin Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know, maybe a little bit Bar Barcelona and some of these other places. Mm-Hmm. What did, what do you find is unique about being in Switzerland and what are some of the, what are some of the positives of having come up in that environment and, and do you feel like there are any negatives of having been there? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tobias: </b>I haven't studied abroad, so it's hard to say, but I think the quality of the education that we get here is really, really excellent. And, I've benefited a lot from very good teachers at all points in my education. And Switzerland is a very rich country. The downside is that it's also a very expensive country to live in as an artist, but there's, I think there's more ways to get funding for projects than in, in many European countries, let's say, certainly than in Germany. That's one of the upsides, I guess. And yeah, the downside is really the high standards of living that we have here, which is good, but which is very expensive if you're trying to kind of lead a life that is not conforming to the usual career expectations. Sure. And also if you want <span style="color:red" data-ts="2178.685" data-end_ts="2178.725" title="2178.685" id=c_"2178.685">__to__</span> invite friends from abroad to do work here, invite artists from abroad, it's much, it's very difficult because it's so much more expensive than other countries. Our 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Time is just about up. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2190.165" data-end_ts="2190.285" title="2190.165" id=c_"2190.165">__I__</span> it's been really great. Kind of like talk about all these different aspects of your work. I'm, I'm just curious, what are you exploring for the future? What's like the next, what are the next things around the corner for you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tobias: </b>So for the rest of the year, I'm gonna be working with Pulp <span style="color:red" data-ts="2207.105" data-end_ts="2207.325" title="2207.105" id=c_"2207.105">__Mar__</span> a lot. And I have a new trio that we're, we just rehearsed for the first couple of times, and it's a trio of three MS 20 mini synthesizers, <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tobias: </b>Choice. It's an instrument that I, it's an instrument that I, discovered. Well, I did, I knew about it for a long time, but I got the chance to buy one for basically half price last spring. And I've also been working on a solo album where the MS 20 mini is basically the, it's doing 90% of the sound and the rest is digital synthesizers and the electronics. So I'm working on that album as well. And we're having a central <span style="color:red" data-ts="2251.075" data-end_ts="2251.365" title="2251.075" id=c_"2251.075">__Zoom__</span> gig in Switzerland coming up in OC in October. And I hope we can do some more recording around that and maybe find more gigs. And I'm working as a free, agent until the end of the year, but then I also have to find some new work to support my life and my family. And, so that's, that's what I'm planning to do in the near future. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Got it. Very interesting. Well, good luck with that. Good. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2281.925" data-end_ts="2282.205" title="2281.925" id=c_"2281.925">__Want__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2282.205" data-end_ts="2282.325" title="2282.205" id=c_"2282.205">__to__</span> thank you so much for taking the time outta your schedule, to, to talk with me. It, I just had a lot of questions and I feel like you really opened, opened the doors to a lot of understanding of how you do things. I'm, I'm always curious about people who are able to juggle a lot of things and, and it's been really interesting to hear about how you do that. So thank you very much for that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tobias: </b>Thank you very much for having me. And you know, thanks for doing the podcast, you know that I got in touch as a listener primarily, and I'm, very much looking forward to continue to listen. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, well, you'll get to listen to yourself now, so, so there's that <laugh>. I do want <span style="color:red" data-ts="2320.245" data-end_ts="2320.325" title="2320.245" id=c_"2320.245">__to__</span> thank you for that. And with that, I'll let you go on with the rest of your day. So thank you so much and have a good one. Thank you. Okay. Many thanks Tobias, for spending the time chatting with us. I love some of those perspectives. I hope you do too. And I hope that you'll come back next week, hope you'll share this podcast with others, with your friends. And, I hope that you will come back next week and enjoy the podcast more. Catch you later. Bye.
