<b>Darwin: </b>All right. This week I am very pleased to introduce you and to be able have a chance to talk with Chris Stack Chris Stack is a person who wears many hats. I'll let him kind of explain what that means. But, he's a person with an incredible background and, and has had the opportunity to work with many incredible people. And, I first got to sort of know him in the virtual sense, by watching his posts on Facebook, and his, and watching him develop his work, on the website, experimental synth.com. He is one of these people that always finds a way to intrigue me. And so, I was really excited to get an opportunity to talk to him, for the podcast. And so with that, I'll, I'll say hi to Chris. Hi, Chris. How are you? Hey, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris Stack: </b>Darling. I'm good. How are you doing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm great. Getting ready for NAMM Gulp. So <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Oh yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. It's always <span style="color:red" data-ts="63.8" data-end_ts="63.92" title="63.8" id=c_"63.8">__a__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>I know that feeling. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Really, it's, I, I think I'm getting a migraine already and I haven't even gotten on the plane. <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, why don't we kick this off by having you tell people about what your, what your creative and your, your creative work life is about. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Okay. Well, it's, it's kind of about a little bit of everything. I've, yeah. I was thinking back on it a while back, and I saw somebody post something that reminded me of an early influence that I'd almost forgotten about. And that was, Michael Oldfield's Tubular Bells. I remember when that first came out, it was, you know, very early album of multi-track music with one artist playing most all the music. And that really impressed me. Back then, it was, that was the thing that, kinda really turned on the light of my head that, Hey, you don't have to do just one thing, you know, you don't have to play just one instrument. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="122.99" data-end_ts="123.28" title="122.99" id=c_"122.99">__that__</span> kind of spilled over to a lot of other aspects of my, my life. And I, I don't, maybe I'm <span style="color:red" data-ts="128" data-end_ts="128.12" title="128" id=c_"128">__a__</span> diante or, <laugh> or something, but I, my my, my interests have always been drawn in a number of different directions. I wouldn't say all directions because there, there are a lot of directions I have no interest in at all. But, I, I don't know. I think I'm interested in interesting things. The definition of that is up the interpretation. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Well, in 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Revision at any time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, one of the things that I noticed is that you, well you, you pointed me towards a set of blogs on the, MOOC Foundation site where you kind of talk about some of your background. And I, I just kind of, I sort of got a second respect for you when you were willing to kind of talk about your prog bague rock background and your <laugh>, at least for a long period of, of time, your desire to have the stack of keyboards, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Oh, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now that seems to have, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>I haven't got over that yet. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Well, I was gonna say, it seems like maybe it's changed, but maybe it hasn't. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>No, no, not at all. Yeah, that, that part has stuck with me throughout the years. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Can you tell us a little bit about your background and what has gotten you to be where you are now? Where right now you're kind of, you kind of play in this area where you're working with different companies and you're interacting with different companies, but you're also introducing a lot of people to what, what's going on that kind of implies an awful lot about having a background with a lot of detailed interaction with, with music gear. What is, can you tell us a little bit about how you got to be the person that you are now, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Probably <span style="color:red" data-ts="229.01" data-end_ts="229.37" title="229.01" id=c_"229.01">__reveal__</span> revealing for me as it is for you? <laugh>, you know, started out my, we always had a piano in the house. I, my mother, was a, was a music lover. And, she bought, you know, saved up and bought a, you know, one of the tiniest spints you could ever get. I think, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="248.25" data-end_ts="248.49" title="248.25" id=c_"248.25">__believe__</span> she did tell me it was the smallest piano you could buy with 88 keys on it. The, the time, you know, she scraped her pennies and bought it, before she got married, I think. And it, it was always in the house, and I was always a little bit interested in it. And one of my dad's aunts had one too, and I was always kind of plunking away on it. In second grade, I started taking piano lessons, and she was in Catholic school at the time, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="271.97" data-end_ts="272.09" title="271.97" id=c_"271.97">__I__</span>, I took piano lessons in the convent. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>So I was in there with the, you know, black rob nun teaching me, how, how to play simple little songs. And I didn't do that for very long. Maybe, probably, less than a year. But it, you know, the interest in it stuck with me. And I, you know, we still always had the piano in the house, and I would plunk away on it. And, you know, did that a little bit until, <span style="color:red" data-ts="296.04" data-end_ts="296.33" title="296.04" id=c_"296.04">__well__</span>, around the time I was 16. We would move south. I was actually living in South Carolina, and a lot of my friends were starting to, or not to play guitar, so some of <span style="color:red" data-ts="309.57" data-end_ts="309.65" title="309.57" id=c_"309.57">__them__</span>, you know, showed me some chords and stuff. And I, I still remembered a little bit of, you know, what middle C was, where d and e were. Right. And I, I, I kind of leapfrogged back and forth with, what I knew from one instrument to the other, and eventually figured out how to play a c major chord on a piano. Just kind of took off from there. The, the other thing that happened a little bit before that, before South Carolina, <span style="color:red" data-ts="332.65" data-end_ts="332.77" title="332.65" id=c_"332.65">__I__</span> lived in Atlanta for a few years, from like 68 to 72. I remember, I think it was sixth or seventh grade, the teacher played <span style="color:red" data-ts="341.89" data-end_ts="342.09" title="341.89" id=c_"341.89">__with__</span> this new album that just came out and there was switched <span style="color:red" data-ts="344.59" data-end_ts="344.81" title="344.59" id=c_"344.59">__on__</span> Bach. So I am one of those many, many people who just got turned on synthesizers because they heard <span style="color:red" data-ts="351.25" data-end_ts="351.49" title="351.25" id=c_"351.25">__switch__</span> on Bach when it first came out. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>How eye-opening that experience was, it just, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="360.12" data-end_ts="360.32" title="360.12" id=c_"360.12">__the__</span> new sounds that I'd never heard before, music technology, it really, really, really kind of kickstarted a, a a lot of artistic and scientific curiosity. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm always curious about the switch on Bach experience. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, when she played the music for you, when this teacher played the music for you, did she also show you the album cover? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Prob I think so. I, I, I think she did. I, I don't recall pouring over, and it was probably one of those things where, you know, there's 20 kids in the class, <span style="color:red" data-ts="388.66" data-end_ts="388.88" title="388.66" id=c_"388.66">__so__</span> we <span style="color:red" data-ts="388.96" data-end_ts="389.04" title="388.96" id=c_"388.96">__just__</span> have to look at it for eight seconds. I see. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Because for me, I remember the almost more influential than the music, the picture of the synthesizer on the front cover. Oh, yeah. Totally. Just twisted my head off. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Yeah. And, you know, that was, you know, probably around the same time Star Trek was coming out too. <laugh>. Yeah. And, you know, we were still, <span style="color:red" data-ts="409.66" data-end_ts="409.88" title="409.66" id=c_"409.66">__you__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="409.88" data-end_ts="410.08" title="409.88" id=c_"409.88">__know__</span>, watching Rockets at the moon, so it was, kind of a synergy. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Indeed. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Things happening at the time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So, given, given kind of the head twister that that switched on Bach was, how did that translate into you changing up your musical direction? Because to this point, you've been, you've filling around with piano, like stuff with rock bands, but how did that turn you into a guy who wanted to emulate Rick Wakeman, for example? What, well, I mean, did, did that open the door for new music, or was that a direction you were <span style="color:red" data-ts="445.2" data-end_ts="445.32" title="445.2" id=c_"445.2">__in__</span>? Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Well, not, not, not right away. It, again, it took, that was probably 10 years old when I heard <span style="color:red" data-ts="451.6" data-end_ts="451.84" title="451.6" id=c_"451.6">__Switch__</span> on Bach when I was 15 or 16, started getting <span style="color:red" data-ts="454.52" data-end_ts="454.72" title="454.52" id=c_"454.52">__the__</span> guitar. <span style="color:red" data-ts="455.5" data-end_ts="455.72" title="455.5" id=c_"455.5">__Mm__</span>, I see. Right around, probably when I was 15, I went over to Friend's House and he, as I was leaving, he hands me an album and says, Hey, you should go listen to this. So I took it home, put it on, and it was, yes, it's close to the Edge. <laugh>, you know, that blew me away. It was like, I, I'd say you, <span style="color:red" data-ts="474.88" data-end_ts="475" title="474.88" id=c_"474.88">__that__</span> it was in some ways that much or more of a revelation <span style="color:red" data-ts="479" data-end_ts="479.2" title="479" id=c_"479">__than__</span> switched on Bach, you know? I mean, at the time I was, I was into, you know, some of the stuff everybody was listening to. I was never, I was never really a huge rock fan, although back then I probably was a bit more mm-hmm. <affirmative>, the Rock. It was there combined with the softer passages, just, and, you know, you know, Wakeman MiniMogue work and all that really, really captured my imagination. Right. And I think, and even by John Anderson's lyrics, I, I, I, I was just so blown away by that. I mean, that was, his lyrics at that time to me were as progressive as any in instrument anybody else was playing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I think that's, that's actually an interesting point. You know, for me, the Prague thing was, was really embodied by, by two groups, Emerson Lake <span style="color:red" data-ts="526.12" data-end_ts="526.28" title="526.12" id=c_"526.12">__of__</span> Palmer, because <span style="color:red" data-ts="526.84" data-end_ts="527.04" title="526.84" id=c_"526.84">__the__</span> best friend was like totally into Keith Emerson. But the other band that, that, doesn't, doesn't get a lot of discussion anymore, but was really super influential to me, was Gentle Giant, which Oh, yeah. Also <span style="color:red" data-ts="542.08" data-end_ts="542.2" title="542.08" id=c_"542.08">__I__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="542.2" data-end_ts="542.48" title="542.2" id=c_"542.2">__that__</span> too also. Yeah. And, there again, I thought very adventurous, lyrical content as well as structural and virtuosic playing, but, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="553.52" data-end_ts="553.72" title="553.52" id=c_"553.52">__the__</span>, it tended more to be songs rather than, just show offs for good chops. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And I think sometimes people forget about that being that, that there was as much progression in lyric lyricism as there was with, with the instrumental playing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Yeah. One thing I loved about Gentle Giant was the interplay of <span style="color:red" data-ts="573.66" data-end_ts="573.88" title="573.66" id=c_"573.66">__the__</span> guitar and Clavet. <span style="color:red" data-ts="575.1" data-end_ts="575.32" title="575.1" id=c_"575.1">__Mm__</span>. I mean, I've always been kind of a sucker for, somehow, I don't know how, but I even at that age was really into classical music <span style="color:red" data-ts="583.34" data-end_ts="583.56" title="583.34" id=c_"583.34">__and__</span> at that time, particularly like Renaissance and Baroque music. Sure. So that Clavet doing not the, the funky type sound <laugh>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="591.54" data-end_ts="591.76" title="591.54" id=c_"591.54">__but__</span> really kind of a, almost like a finger <span style="color:red" data-ts="593.76" data-end_ts="594.04" title="593.76" id=c_"593.76">__picked__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="594.11" data-end_ts="594.4" title="594.11" id=c_"594.11">__loop__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, yeah. Or a harp, cordish kind of thing. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Right. Exactly. You became someone who got fascinated with Prague <span style="color:red" data-ts="601.68" data-end_ts="601.8" title="601.68" id=c_"601.68">__and__</span>, and, and started working on those chops, but simultaneously you got into electronics. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Almost simultaneously. I, I probably was getting into fog a little bit before the electronics. Okay. Probably from first grade until about 10th grade, I was a pretty bad student in, in, school. I mean, just barely passing every year. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>And it was really kind of around when I started listening to Yes. And kind of, kind of reignited a little bit of that artistic and scientific curiosity that, kind of got started with Switched on Bach. It, I mean, it sounds funny to say, but it really made me a better student in school, and it just kind of got me more interested in things. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, I, you know, at the time we'd moved to South Carolina, it <span style="color:red" data-ts="651.04" data-end_ts="651.16" title="651.04" id=c_"651.04">__was__</span> a fairly really rural area, but <span style="color:red" data-ts="653.8" data-end_ts="653.92" title="653.8" id=c_"653.8">__a__</span> somewhat rural area, and I was really not happy living there, you know, for a number of years. And, when I kind of got into that, it was, it was something that sparked my interest, and it really just kind of made me engaged a little bit more. And I think that it really kinda showed <span style="color:red" data-ts="669.72" data-end_ts="669.88" title="669.72" id=c_"669.72">__me__</span> my schoolwork too. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>So by the time I graduated, I was, you know, like pretty much all As and B's, Uhhuh, <affirmative>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="675.82" data-end_ts="676.04" title="675.82" id=c_"675.82">__Now__</span>, I, I would say that that electronic music led me astray a little bit there. I, didn't really jump straight into college after that. I wanted to take a little bit of time off and worked a couple of factory jobs and did, did <span style="color:red" data-ts="690.24" data-end_ts="690.36" title="690.24" id=c_"690.24">__a__</span> quick little pass at college, but didn't really get into it because I was really at that point really getting interested and synthesizes. Okay. And I thought the quickest way to do it was just to go straight, get a job, start making money, and, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And buy some synthesizers. Yeah. Right. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Which I, which I did my, my, my first synth was a Corg micro preset, followed by a Corg seven <span style="color:red" data-ts="711.68" data-end_ts="712.04" title="711.68" id=c_"711.68">__70__</span>. After that, I took out <span style="color:red" data-ts="714" data-end_ts="714.12" title="714" id=c_"714">__a__</span>, a bigger loan and at the same time bought a micro <span style="color:red" data-ts="717.75" data-end_ts="718.04" title="717.75" id=c_"717.75">__mode__</span> and Amar performer stream syn. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>There's the, the beginning of the stack. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Yeah. Yeah. Around the same time, <span style="color:red" data-ts="725.48" data-end_ts="725.68" title="725.48" id=c_"725.48">__or__</span> right after I bought one of those, <span style="color:red" data-ts="727.34" data-end_ts="727.56" title="727.34" id=c_"727.34">__it__</span> was Yamaha, like <span style="color:red" data-ts="728.32" data-end_ts="728.44" title="728.32" id=c_"728.32">__a__</span> piano, I forget what it was. Number was, it wasn't electric grand. It was, it was kind of the, the vaguely roady Yamaha <span style="color:red" data-ts="736.78" data-end_ts="737" title="736.78" id=c_"736.78">__or__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="737" data-end_ts="737.16" title="737" id=c_"737">__piano__</span> around the same time. Oh, yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Right. I can't even remember. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="740.27" data-end_ts="740.56" title="740.27" id=c_"740.27">__Yeah__</span>. Had the case built into it, the top came off and became <span style="color:red" data-ts="743.1" data-end_ts="743.32" title="743.1" id=c_"743.1">__way__</span>, I mean, un unlike the CS 80, you got back on that thing sounded really terrible. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Yeah. There are some cases where, nostalgia may be misplaced and, now 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Kept up <span style="color:red" data-ts="757.68" data-end_ts="757.84" title="757.68" id=c_"757.68">__and__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="757.84" data-end_ts="758.04" title="757.84" id=c_"757.84">__nothing__</span> up. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Given, given that set of gear, it also sort of implies that you were, you would've been working with bands at the time because none of those things were <span style="color:red" data-ts="769.23" data-end_ts="769.52" title="769.23" id=c_"769.23">__MiFi__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="770.42" data-end_ts="770.64" title="770.42" id=c_"770.42">__you__</span>, did you get into recording? How did, did you have sort of like a personal music work thing, or were you mostly working in bands at this point? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>More of a personal thing. I, I was real, I mean, I was really into Prague, lemme just say in late seventies, Spartanburg, South Carolina was not the hotbed of Prague fandom. Right. It was, it's, I mean it's, you know, great band that, give you an idea. Marshall Tucker was the opening band for probably the first eight concerts I went to 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>And I mean, they were actually, you know, for a southern rock, they were really very innovative. Right. I mean, they had a fleet player and a, you know, mini <span style="color:red" data-ts="811.76" data-end_ts="812.04" title="811.76" id=c_"811.76">__mode__</span> on a number of songs. And, interesting, little aside to that is around the same time, they had their own recording studio kind of on the outskirts of town. And I saw something in the paper. A representative from the Mogue factory was going to be there one night showing the brand new poly <span style="color:red" data-ts="830.83" data-end_ts="831.12" title="830.83" id=c_"830.83">__mode__</span> <laugh>. So I, I went down there and got to play that for a little bit, and then that blew me away. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="836.46" data-end_ts="836.68" title="836.46" id=c_"836.46">__Oh__</span>, no doubt. 
</p>

</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, yeah. Sure. Well, it's interesting because I, like you grew up in a real rural area. My, my rural area was northern Wisconsin, <span style="color:red" data-ts="852.98" data-end_ts="853.2" title="852.98" id=c_"852.98">__and__</span> believe me, no <span style="color:red" data-ts="854.44" data-end_ts="854.72" title="854.44" id=c_"854.44">__Moog__</span> representative was coming up to, you know, knows pick Wisconsin to, to show anything.

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>I forget, I forget who the guy was. Remember me. He had worked, he was an engineer and he had worked on the, the old big 12 stage phase or something that they had. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, okay. So I'm curious about how you got <span style="color:red" data-ts="882.97" data-end_ts="883.09" title="882.97" id=c_"882.97">__an__</span> electronics, because when I, when I look at your history, you've got this, you kind of have this, this player track. You have kind of an engineering and circuit design track and kind of a marketing track. And I'm curious about where the electronic and circuit design track, 'cause especially right now with the resurgent of interest in modular sense, kind of the resurgence of interest in d i y kind of things. There are a lot of people that want to know, how can I take my musicianly background and somehow pull together mm-hmm. <affirmative> a an electronics capable background. And I have to admit Yeah. I, I don't know how that works. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>It, it, some of that really kind of in right after we, <span style="color:red" data-ts="929.78" data-end_ts="930" title="929.78" id=c_"929.78">__we__</span> just left off in that story part, part of it is we're looking back on it, I was just really lucky in some instances, just, you know, happened to be in the right place at the right time. And that right place was someplace you would've never imagined. It would've been. I used to kick outta this old saying, you know, you got a bloom, or you're planted and mm-hmm. <affirmative> again, some, I think some of it was, you know, working hard and applying myself. Right. Actually, probably a lot of it was, or like Woody Allen said, 80% the success was just showing up. <span style="color:red" data-ts="958.55" data-end_ts="958.67" title="958.55" id=c_"958.55">__I__</span> actually got a couple of fairly lucky breaks.

Had a, you know, band done in the basement for years. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>And we, you know, I, I had never really had that, a good enough year, probably good enough chops to really learn to play covers <span style="color:red" data-ts="974.01" data-end_ts="974.23" title="974.01" id=c_"974.01">__of__</span> close to the edge and stuff like that.

Like, like I was, and they liked rock more, and you wanted to get out and play bars, and Sure. As long as I was having fun, I didn't care. But Right, right Around that time too, I started realizing that working in a zinc die casting factory was not something I wanted to do for the rest of my life. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I wonder why. 
</p>

<p>

So I started going to Spartanburg Technical College, actually starting out in industrial electronics. Did that for about a quarter and switched over to, Al Engineering. And I'm getting my, my two year degree in electrical engineering technology. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, okay. What is industrial electronics? Is that just like wiring stuff 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Up? It's more, yeah. A little, little bit more towards fixing things electrical in a factory, you know. I see there, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1101.26" data-end_ts="1101.48" title="1101.26" id=c_"1101.26">__at__</span> that time there was still a lot of cotton mills and some other industry around, and that area was, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1106.3" data-end_ts="1106.52" title="1106.3" id=c_"1106.3">__it__</span> was a very industrial area.

And, you know, the, engineering was basically, I mean, it, it was a two year degree, so it wasn't really like you were design engineer, but you, you <span style="color:red" data-ts="1119.88" data-end_ts="1120" title="1119.88" id=c_"1119.88">__were__</span> being trained to work with and, and, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1121.84" data-end_ts="1122.04" title="1121.84" id=c_"1121.84">__or__</span> would be various other similar type of things. Well, other higher level electronic stuff, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1127.02" data-end_ts="1127.24" title="1127.02" id=c_"1127.02">__bit__</span> more microprocessing, my microprocessor programming and Sure. Yeah. So I did that for two years, got <span style="color:red" data-ts="1133.84" data-end_ts="1134" title="1133.84" id=c_"1133.84">__out__</span> there. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1134.52" data-end_ts="1134.64" title="1134.52" id=c_"1134.52">__I__</span> actually made good <span style="color:red" data-ts="1135.76" data-end_ts="1135.96" title="1135.76" id=c_"1135.76">__grades__</span> there on the dean's list most of the time. And then it was great too, because at that time, you know, I had a, for the time, a pretty decent sense setup. And a lot of the stuff I was learning in school, I had immediate applications for it at, at home. And I mean, not just electronics, but particularly like physics and math, you know, and in trig when adding sign <span style="color:red" data-ts="1156.6" data-end_ts="1156.8" title="1156.6" id=c_"1156.6">__ways__</span>, I could go home and get my, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1159.12" data-end_ts="1159.36" title="1159.12" id=c_"1159.12">__<inaudible>__</span> DX 100 and add a couple sign waves. And I, I had an aScope at the time <span style="color:red" data-ts="1163.59" data-end_ts="1163.88" title="1163.59" id=c_"1163.59">__that__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1163.91" data-end_ts="1164.2" title="1163.91" id=c_"1163.91">__they__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1164.2" data-end_ts="1164.36" title="1164.2" id=c_"1164.2">__would__</span> pull up on the screen and actually be and hear a representation of the stuff that I was studying <span style="color:red" data-ts="1169.06" data-end_ts="1169.28" title="1169.06" id=c_"1169.06">__in__</span> trig. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, that's actually <span style="color:red" data-ts="1170.96" data-end_ts="1171.08" title="1170.96" id=c_"1170.96">__a__</span>, a really interesting point. I mean, people go so far outta their way now to try and model mathematical concepts, and some of these concepts are actually so easy to implement on synthesizers. Now, let's, let's jump, let's jump forward a bit. You now have this keyboard life and, you know, it sounds like you had a little four track recorder and you were doing that kind of thing. Did you keep on, did you keep on updating that? So like, when MIDI came in, did you get a bunch of MIDI stuff? Did you kind of follow that track? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Yeah, no, it, it, it was, it was on then <laugh>, I bought everything. I know it's been no turning backs since <laugh>. I, I have been a gear hound ever since then. If I still had every piece of gear I've ever owned, shortly after that last set, I just subscribed <span style="color:red" data-ts="1215.22" data-end_ts="1215.44" title="1215.22" id=c_"1215.22">__or__</span> described to you mm-hmm. <affirmative> since Sonic SQ one and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1219.08" data-end_ts="1219.2" title="1219.08" id=c_"1219.08">__a__</span> Mirage came out, and that became, oh man, my <span style="color:red" data-ts="1221.64" data-end_ts="1221.84" title="1221.64" id=c_"1221.64">__two__</span> workhorses. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So did you get into, did you ever get into like the computer sequencing end of it as well? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Oh, yeah. Yeah. I had a, I, I had a Yamaha CX five M Oh 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Remember that? Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The music computer, all one word. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Although, I actually can't say really did sequencing on that. That was something that looked really cool and had an interesting FM then <span style="color:red" data-ts="1245.54" data-end_ts="1245.76" title="1245.54" id=c_"1245.54">__in__</span> the building librarian.

My, my first sequencer, actually, I just made a comment on this, on a dystopia post today. They had an article about some old, sequential circuit sequencer. My, my first real sequencer was the sequential circuit cartridge for the Commodore 64. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1262.7" data-end_ts="1262.92" title="1262.7" id=c_"1262.7">__Or__</span> I remember being at <span style="color:red" data-ts="1264.32" data-end_ts="1264.44" title="1264.32" id=c_"1264.32">__a__</span> music store one time, kind of looking, trying to search out some old analog gear that might be laying around. And, they were like, oh, you mean like sequential circuit? I'm like, yeah, yeah. You have some Ss c i stuff. And they're like, yeah, we got one piece in behind the counter here. And he pulls out that. And I was like, <laugh> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1285.62" data-end_ts="1285.84" title="1285.62" id=c_"1285.62">__ha__</span>, thanks. But no. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Yeah. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Maybe another one of those things that is, doesn't quite uphold up, although quite frankly, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>If you had <span style="color:red" data-ts="1296.24" data-end_ts="1296.4" title="1296.24" id=c_"1296.24">__Commerce__</span> 64 <span style="color:red" data-ts="1296.88" data-end_ts="1297.12" title="1296.88" id=c_"1296.88">__work__</span>, and I mean, you'd be sure would've jumped 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>On. I was, I was gonna say, it would be kind of interesting now to go back and see a Commodore 64 with one of those sequencing cartridges and see what come out of it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Oh, yeah. Yeah. I, I can't even remember what its capabilities were. I just remembered, you know, being able to sequence was just like, oh my God, I can, yeah. You know, that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1315.44" data-end_ts="1315.72" title="1315.44" id=c_"1315.44">__freeze__</span> me after this.

And you know, about that time too, I, I was in school and, you know, didn't really have time to get together with my friends a lot. So I was, I was actually getting at that point, shifting a little bit more over to the self-contained, you know, electronic musicians as opposed to the, the guy in the band kind of thing. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I wanna talk about that a little bit, because what you've mentioned before about working with the band, who might've been a little frustrated. 'cause I, I was a guitar player prior to getting electronic music. I was a guitar player, but I also liked composition. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Mm-hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative>. And the reason I got into electronic music is because all of a sudden I could experiment freely and I could try things out without either having to humiliate myself in front of the band. 'cause there were times mm-hmm. <affirmative>, I remember the one time, you know, writing out charts and putting <span style="color:red" data-ts="1365.44" data-end_ts="1365.66" title="1365.44" id=c_"1365.44">__out__</span> in front of the band and the bass player just kind of sneers about how, you know, I had, I had notated a certain eighth note thing, <laugh>, and I was like, you know, there's gotta be a way to try music without getting humiliated for trying. Right. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>As soon as the, the first time someone bolted MIDI onto a computer I was in, I was all in. Right. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. I'm curious for you, what was the thing that was kind of the driving course? Was it, was it time? Was it just a desire to want to chill out and work on your own thing? Did you have a noise in your head that you had to get out? What, what was it that really was sort of like the innermost force for you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Well, I don't know. I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1410.14" data-end_ts="1410.34" title="1410.14" id=c_"1410.14">__say__</span> there was noise in my head. I wanted to get out. I, I, I knew there were noises out there. I wanted to get into my head. Uhhuh, <affirmative>. You know, there was all kind of new stuff coming out. You know, at, at that point too, I was probably getting away from what you would call Prague. A lot of the bands I was listening to went off in directions I didn't particularly care for mm-hmm. <affirmative> and I actually went through a big phase, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1433.2" data-end_ts="1433.4" title="1433.2" id=c_"1433.2">__it__</span> still <span style="color:red" data-ts="1433.64" data-end_ts="1433.84" title="1433.64" id=c_"1433.64">__has__</span> a bit to this day where Joni Mitchell was my favorite musician.

We, we, we did actually for a while, we, we did a couple of covers of, couple of piano songs off court and Spark. I think at that time I had the SQ one and I could do a, a semi-decent piano right around that time too. That kind of got me back into piano. My taste in, instrumentation. In some ways music are a little different than a lot of people who kind of followed the same track. Even when I was in the Prague, I'd never liked Hammond Organ. Yeah, yeah. To me, it was just something people played when they couldn't afford enough synthesizers, <laugh>.

</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That's another one of those albums that really hooked a lot of people into a new way of thinking. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> Sure. So

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>They really, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1568.75" data-end_ts="1569.04" title="1568.75" id=c_"1568.75">__they__</span> really kicked, kicked me into a lot of, piano improvisation.

</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, jumping ahead a little bit further, at some point you started getting involved in the music industry. How did that happen? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Well, by a circuitous path. You know, when I got out of, college, I went to work for a, and this was one of those somewhat lucky breaks, went to work for one of the very few computer manufacturers in South Carolina <span style="color:red" data-ts="1600.87" data-end_ts="1601.16" title="1600.87" id=c_"1600.87">__that__</span>, happened to be over, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1602.46" data-end_ts="1602.68" title="1602.46" id=c_"1602.46">__you__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1602.68" data-end_ts="1602.72" title="1602.68" id=c_"1602.68">__know__</span>, just across the county line from where I live. So there's a company called Computer Dynamics. Started out as a, re repair tech, but pretty quick. I've <span style="color:red" data-ts="1611.56" data-end_ts="1611.68" title="1611.56" id=c_"1611.56">__lived__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1611.68" data-end_ts="1611.88" title="1611.68" id=c_"1611.68">__in__</span> a few months, I think wound up working in the, engineering departments, starting out helping the people who did the printed circuit design. They, they had these huge old workstations they used to do it on. And when they'd get done with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1624.2" data-end_ts="1624.36" title="1624.2" id=c_"1624.2">__the__</span>, board design, they would print 'em out like four to one scale and using a pen plotter. And my job was to get the schematic and a yellow highlighter, and make sure that every line on the schematic corresponded to the line on the, on the PC artwork, and trace <span style="color:red" data-ts="1639.28" data-end_ts="1639.44" title="1639.28" id=c_"1639.28">__some__</span> lines for about two or three days. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>And they were actually fairly big, fairly complex boards. Did that for a little bit. And then they had an opening, and I became a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1646.24" data-end_ts="1646.44" title="1646.24" id=c_"1646.24">__printed__</span> circuit designer and did that, you know, all day, every day for 10 years. Near the end of working for computer dynamics, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1653.62" data-end_ts="1653.84" title="1653.62" id=c_"1653.62">__the__</span>, some of the folks in the marketing departments had just <span style="color:red" data-ts="1656.04" data-end_ts="1656.28" title="1656.04" id=c_"1656.04">__started__</span> getting into like, Photoshop. And I think it was actually like al <span style="color:red" data-ts="1659" data-end_ts="1659.12" title="1659" id=c_"1659">__this__</span> p <span style="color:red" data-ts="1659.58" data-end_ts="1659.8" title="1659.58" id=c_"1659.58">__so__</span> back Photoshop mm-hmm. <affirmative>, they came down one day and said, Hey, you know, you, you know how to use this CAD software. Maybe you can help us with Photoshop. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1667.31" data-end_ts="1667.6" title="1667.31" id=c_"1667.31">__That__</span> began my, segue into marketing after that. I spent 10 years for a, a company that actually my lab partner in college started. He was doing installs for <span style="color:red" data-ts="1677.56" data-end_ts="1677.64" title="1677.56" id=c_"1677.56">__the__</span> local cable system and noticed they had a bunch of broken converter boxes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>So he started this company fixing converter boxes. And in the 10 years that I was <span style="color:red" data-ts="1685.12" data-end_ts="1685.24" title="1685.12" id=c_"1685.12">__at__</span> Computer Dynamics, he had built it up pretty big. He had <span style="color:red" data-ts="1687.8" data-end_ts="1687.92" title="1687.8" id=c_"1687.8">__like__</span> 30 or 40 employees and was wanting to get into manufacturing mm-hmm. <affirmative>. So I, I came over, started working with him, helped him with that, kind of got the manufacturing part of that company going, and then switched over into marketing because I, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1701.04" data-end_ts="1701.16" title="1701.04" id=c_"1701.04">__I__</span> needed more help there. And for 10 years there I was, I had one boss every called me <span style="color:red" data-ts="1705.94" data-end_ts="1706.16" title="1705.94" id=c_"1705.94">__is__</span> Utility Infielder. I kind of switched around between, manufacturing manager, marketing manager <span style="color:red" data-ts="1712.81" data-end_ts="1713.16" title="1712.81" id=c_"1712.81">__about__</span> the last year. And a, I was engineering manager <span style="color:red" data-ts="1715.75" data-end_ts="1716.04" title="1715.75" id=c_"1715.75">__that__</span> did a lot of different things that that company eventually shut down. And I was working with some of the, some of the other people there were trying to get another company going. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>And about that time, a component sales rep that I do, he knew I was into electronic music. He said, Hey, I, you know, I hear Mode needs a marketing manager, you're up. But I, I should say, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1736.36" data-end_ts="1736.48" title="1736.36" id=c_"1736.36">__actually__</span>, let's just get back a little bit, because one of the, the biggest things that ever happened to me, I really think, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1741.58" data-end_ts="1741.8" title="1741.58" id=c_"1741.58">__so__</span> when I was still <span style="color:red" data-ts="1742.24" data-end_ts="1742.4" title="1742.24" id=c_"1742.24">__at__</span> Computer Dynamics, and this was part of, one of those things about kind of being lucky and in the right place at the right time was, you know, this time I'm, you know, full on <span style="color:red" data-ts="1752.48" data-end_ts="1752.76" title="1752.48" id=c_"1752.48">__10th__</span> freak, you know, up to my ears in electronic music and electronics. And one day I pick up the paper and there's an article that said, Bob <span style="color:red" data-ts="1763.15" data-end_ts="1763.44" title="1763.15" id=c_"1763.15">__Moog__</span> lives in Asheville and teaches <span style="color:red" data-ts="1764.76" data-end_ts="1764.96" title="1764.76" id=c_"1764.76">__at__</span> U N C A and it's giving <span style="color:red" data-ts="1765.84" data-end_ts="1765.96" title="1765.84" id=c_"1765.84">__a__</span> public lecture this Saturday.

Yeah. So of course, I drove up and attended the lecture. After it was over, I went up <span style="color:red" data-ts="1781.8" data-end_ts="1781.92" title="1781.8" id=c_"1781.8">__and__</span> introduced myself and talking to him for a minute, and then I gave him my card and said, Hey, <inaudible> a circuit designer.

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right.

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>I wound up, doing a little freelance work for him, designing, three different circuit boards, which were part of his, multi-tech keyboard <span style="color:red" data-ts="1807.54" data-end_ts="1807.76" title="1807.54" id=c_"1807.54">__set__</span> up.

<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> <laugh>. That's wild. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>My head a little bit. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And, and so how did, how did, so that was like your intro, introduction into mi. How did you continue? Because at some point you ended up as like marketing manager for <span style="color:red" data-ts="1843.43" data-end_ts="1843.72" title="1843.43" id=c_"1843.43">__mold__</span> music, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Yeah, I, I should say that, it, the funny thing is that having done that work for Bob and becoming marketing manager had almost no relationship to each other. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, really? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Yeah. It's, it's kind of strange when I think backlog, that was probably early nineties <span style="color:red" data-ts="1859.4" data-end_ts="1859.68" title="1859.4" id=c_"1859.4">__there__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1859.68" data-end_ts="1860.12" title="1859.68" id=c_"1859.68">__bouncers__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1860.2" data-end_ts="1860.32" title="1860.2" id=c_"1860.2">__I__</span> would've, I did that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So that would've been back when he was doing it as Big Briar, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. Definitely Big Briar. And actually on that, that blog post, I've got a couple old, pieces of schematic and stuff <span style="color:red" data-ts="1870.56" data-end_ts="1870.8" title="1870.56" id=c_"1870.56">__that's__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1870.8" data-end_ts="1870.88" title="1870.8" id=c_"1870.8">__that__</span> Big Briar and Oh, nice. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1872" data-end_ts="1872.4" title="1872" id=c_"1872">__Heather__</span> and everything. There's a couple of boards for 'em. But, unfortunately, my, my job at dbs, the, the cable TV electronics company was consuming so much of my time that I wasn't able to really continue doing side work for 'em. My, after the multi <span style="color:red" data-ts="1886.2" data-end_ts="1886.44" title="1886.2" id=c_"1886.2">__steps__</span> keyboard thing, a little bit later he called me up and was just starting on a mid Airman. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>And I, I did a little bit of work on that. I, I didn't actually even get, do any board layout. One of the first steps of that is, particularly somebody hinges just <span style="color:red" data-ts="1900.04" data-end_ts="1900.16" title="1900.04" id=c_"1900.04">__a__</span>, a paper schematic. You have to do what <span style="color:red" data-ts="1901.76" data-end_ts="1901.84" title="1901.76" id=c_"1901.76">__you__</span> call schematic capture, which is basically re redraw the schematic in the CAD software, and you dump that database over into the P c <span style="color:red" data-ts="1909.48" data-end_ts="1909.6" title="1909.48" id=c_"1909.48">__B__</span> side of it. And then <span style="color:red" data-ts="1910.82" data-end_ts="1911.04" title="1910.82" id=c_"1910.82">__we__</span> do the board layout. So I, I did part of that and, wound up kind of handing that off to, one of my coworkers. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So you actually kind of got disconnected from, from Bob at that point. How did you ever get 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Back? I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1922.6" data-end_ts="1922.76" title="1922.6" id=c_"1922.6">__did__</span> very much. Well, I, I didn't really, and there's a really bizarre story about that. I'll, I'll, I'll tell you here in a second, but, yeah, I would see in my, Asheville was about an hour from Spartanburg where I was living. Okay. And it was even back then was a much more interesting town. So I, I was actually driving up to Asheville quite often, so much so that a decade before I moved up here, most people up here thought I already lived here so much. I would run into bother once in a while, bookstore or something. We, we would talk, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1951.44" data-end_ts="1951.64" title="1951.44" id=c_"1951.44">__but__</span> never <span style="color:red" data-ts="1952.74" data-end_ts="1952.96" title="1952.74" id=c_"1952.74">__at__</span> any great length. And, unfortunately when he, when he died in 2005, I think I, oh, I did see one time I did get to hang out with him. The last time I saw him alive actually was at a, local bar here called the Gray Eagle.

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Wow. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Yeah. So anyway, about a year and a half later when I finally went to work for gue, and again, I had a connection through a, a component sales rep mm-hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>And wound up, eventually getting the job. It, it was funny, I, went up and was interviewed by, maybe <span style="color:red" data-ts="2247.94" data-end_ts="2248.16" title="2247.94" id=c_"2247.94">__by__</span> President Mode and by Bob's widow. I, I, I had a really good feeling. It was like, it seemed like I was a really good fit for it.

</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh my. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>And then, about a week later, I get a call again. And, they offered me the job again. I guess <span style="color:red" data-ts="2271.04" data-end_ts="2271.24" title="2271.04" id=c_"2271.04">__it__</span> was whoever they hired didn't work out. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. That's, that's strange. That's, I mean, also good that it ended up playing out because that kind of Yeah. Yeah. That's, that's where you kind of got your mi bones then, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Oh, yeah. Yeah. Very much so. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now since then, one of the places where you came into my radar real strongly is with the work that Paul VO has been doing with his thing. I don't even know what to call it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What, what am I supposed to call, call it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>I mean, he invented the technology behind the mo guitar when I was still <span style="color:red" data-ts="2306.76" data-end_ts="2306.88" title="2306.76" id=c_"2306.76">__in__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2306.88" data-end_ts="2307.04" title="2306.88" id=c_"2306.88">__mode__</span>. Right. And a lot of my time there was <span style="color:red" data-ts="2309.53" data-end_ts="2309.88" title="2309.53" id=c_"2309.53">__spent__</span> with the launch of that and various things. But then afterwards, probably what you're talking about is the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2315.2" data-end_ts="2315.32" title="2315.2" id=c_"2315.2">__V__</span> 96. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Yeah. That, that was, that was after I had left mode. And, Paul and I had become friends when I was there, and he, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2325.8" data-end_ts="2325.92" title="2325.8" id=c_"2325.8">__actually__</span> wasn't living in Asheville when we launched a guitar, but he eventually moved here. And I mean, I'm, I'm a guitar player in some ways, as much as I, I'm a keyboard player, you <span style="color:red" data-ts="2334.52" data-end_ts="2334.56" title="2334.52" id=c_"2334.52">__know__</span>, guitar nude and bass. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>If you watch kind of the, the scroll images at the top of experimental synth, I think the only picture actually of you is you playing guitar, not playing keyboards. Which is kind of funny because I think if you primarily as a keyboard guy, except you've got a lot of history tied into guitar as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>I, I do, I do. Keyboards are maybe slightly more my main instrument, but not as much. Not, I mean, not by a huge amount. And probably more of the gigs I play are on string instruments there on keyboards. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, really? Interesting. Yeah. So let's talk about the VO 96, because I mm-hmm. <affirmative>, I mean, so there are a lot of phrases that kind of stick around this thing. So sometimes it's called an acoustic synthesizer. . <affirmative>. I can't, I don't understand. Help me understand a little bit. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Well, yeah. The first thing to understand when, when you see particularly our first videos on that, and almost any of them, is that, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2395.67" data-end_ts="2395.96" title="2395.67" id=c_"2395.67">__that__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2395.96" data-end_ts="2396.2" title="2395.96" id=c_"2395.96">__that__</span> guitar is not plugged into an amp or anything. It's just a guy sitting on a chair with a guitar and it's making those sounds. Okay. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2403.7" data-end_ts="2403.92" title="2403.7" id=c_"2403.7">__The__</span>, it, it is actually making the strings make those sounds. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So it's a string activation system. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Yeah. Okay. And, you know, then in, in more ways than just <span style="color:red" data-ts="2415.52" data-end_ts="2415.64" title="2415.52" id=c_"2415.52">__a__</span> sustainer, because I mean, it's actually doing some pretty sophisticated, control of harmonics. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2421.58" data-end_ts="2421.8" title="2421.58" id=c_"2421.58">__Ah__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>And it really is, I mean, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2423.16" data-end_ts="2423.32" title="2423.16" id=c_"2423.16">__and__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2423.32" data-end_ts="2423.52" title="2423.32" id=c_"2423.32">__and__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2423.52" data-end_ts="2423.76" title="2423.52" id=c_"2423.52">__your__</span> in, in <span style="color:red" data-ts="2425.48" data-end_ts="2425.6" title="2425.48" id=c_"2425.48">__a__</span> pretty chance really offering sound with that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. So how does, so do you play one in your own, in your own 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Work? I, I do. I, I actually, do not have one of my own yet. I, I get to borrow <span style="color:red" data-ts="2441.52" data-end_ts="2441.81" title="2441.52" id=c_"2441.52">__from__</span> quite often. Sure. I have a mo guitar that I use quite a bit. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see. Okay. So what, from like a player standpoint, what, what's different about it in terms of playing style or playing mechanism? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Well, it's, it's, it's really nothing. And I, it's one of those things that's kind of like the mo guitar that <span style="color:red" data-ts="2460.79" data-end_ts="2461.01" title="2460.79" id=c_"2460.79">__you__</span>, you <span style="color:red" data-ts="2461.37" data-end_ts="2461.73" title="2461.37" id=c_"2461.37">__really__</span>, until you play it, it's, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2463.95" data-end_ts="2464.17" title="2463.95" id=c_"2463.95">__you__</span>, you see it and you see it <span style="color:red" data-ts="2465.01" data-end_ts="2465.13" title="2465.01" id=c_"2465.01">__just__</span> ing it sounds cool, but really feeling it under your fingers is where you really kind of get it. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2471" data-end_ts="2471.29" title="2471" id=c_"2471">__with__</span> when, particularly with the VO 96, when you, you know, when you're sitting there on a rocking chair with this guitar that's not plugged into anything. Yeah. And harmonics are dancing out of it like that <laugh>, and then you, you know, you feel the body of guitar vibrating against your chest. You feel it tingling your fingers 'cause <span style="color:red" data-ts="2488.09" data-end_ts="2488.29" title="2488.09" id=c_"2488.09">__those__</span> strings are still vibrating. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, it just becomes a very visceral, very, very connected playing experience. I mean, I, I've played some guitars since I, and they're kind of fun, but Yeah. You know, when when you pluck a string and a trumpet comes out, it's cool, but it's hard to really feel as connected as that sound as when the string you're actually plucking is making that sound. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Yeah. Yeah. That's, that's not, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2512.3" data-end_ts="2512.72" title="2512.3" id=c_"2512.3">__That's__</span> puppet sounds, but it, it does some pretty out there sounds and you, you really feel it making them while they're doing it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I actually think though that it's, it's important that it makes its own sound. My, my first experience, I was one of the first people in the US to get <span style="color:red" data-ts="2526.1" data-end_ts="2526.32" title="2526.1" id=c_"2526.1">__ag__</span> because I had friends <span style="color:red" data-ts="2527.91" data-end_ts="2528.2" title="2527.91" id=c_"2527.91">__with__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2528.2" data-end_ts="2528.36" title="2528.2" id=c_"2528.2">__the__</span> friends to, to have the Roland gr 300 guitar synth when it first came out. Right. And I remember at first being kind of frustrated that, you know, it made a really bad trumpet or it made a really bad violin, but what it actually did was sort of like that iconic screaming elephant noise that guitar <span style="color:red" data-ts="2550.2" data-end_ts="2550.36" title="2550.2" id=c_"2550.2">__said__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2550.52" data-end_ts="2550.64" title="2550.52" id=c_"2550.52">__<crosstalk>__</span> kind 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Of thing. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. All of a sudden, when, when you realize that's actually the sound of this instrument, Uhhuh <affirmative>, it became really a great thing to use as long as you just embraced it is that's the sound of the instrument. It seems to me like, like with the, with the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2568.17" data-end_ts="2568.52" title="2568.17" id=c_"2568.17">__phone__</span> 96, that that's, that's what's happening there. There's actually still the process of defining what the voice of this instrument is 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Mm-hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative> and embracing that, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Yeah. And, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2581.48" data-end_ts="2581.64" title="2581.48" id=c_"2581.48">__and__</span> actually the possibilities of it are still pretty much in the infancy. You know, the hardware is there that it has, you know, very precise control over what's, I think, 16 harmonics per string. You know, it's, it's capable of doing quite a bit with the firmware that's in it now, but, you know, it is really just kinda scratching the surface of what acoustic synthesis can do or what <span style="color:red" data-ts="2603.62" data-end_ts="2603.84" title="2603.62" id=c_"2603.62">__can__</span> actually be done with that hardware. 
</p>

<p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Well, we did, we did the Kickstarter for <span style="color:red" data-ts="2646.4" data-end_ts="2646.56" title="2646.4" id=c_"2646.4">__him__</span>, which went really well.

<p>

</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Given that this is actually not gonna air until a namm, is there anything you can say about it, or should I just wait and, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Yeah, see, I can't really say anything right now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Well, if nothing else, what I'll do is on my outro tag or whatever, I'll just mention that I uhhuh <affirmative>, because I'm gonna make a point of going and checking it out. For sure. So before I let you go, and again, I appreciate you being, being willing to give, give me so much of your time. I have to ask you one thing that I'm really curious about, because I'm curious about this in relationship to a lot of the people I talk to, it seems like there are certain areas of the country that are, that have a magnetic draw for creative people. So, you know, New York has always kind of been that way. San Francisco has always kind of been that way as well as like the outlying areas of Berkeley and stuff like that. Los Angeles often is that, Portland has become that, and Asheville has become that 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2829.37" data-end_ts="2829.59" title="2829.37" id=c_"2829.37">__In__</span> a, in a very real way. I, I, there is a lot of discussion about Asheville is kind of, you know, first of all, sort of like, I, I hate to say it, but sort of like the, the Portland of the South or something. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>I say that's, that's a valid comparison. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And, and just that 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2847.83" data-end_ts="2847.91" title="2847.83" id=c_"2847.83">__It__</span>, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2848.03" data-end_ts="2848.11" title="2848.03" id=c_"2848.03">__know__</span> a lot of people that have gone back and forth between the two cities. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, really? Well, it just seems interesting that, that this area has all of a sudden sort of generated a, a culture that is very unique, very unique for the South, certainly, but kind of unique among small cities in the US anyway. What do you think, what do you think causes that and Well, it's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>An amazing place. And, and you know, it's actually in some ways that it's not as new as you might think. I'm, I'm sitting in my apartment on the north side of town, about half a mile from where Bob <span style="color:red" data-ts="2888.94" data-end_ts="2889.16" title="2888.94" id=c_"2888.94">__Mo__</span> lives. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2891.12" data-end_ts="2891.24" title="2891.12" id=c_"2891.12">__A__</span> good friend Gary, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2891.97" data-end_ts="2892.32" title="2891.97" id=c_"2891.97">__Elton__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2892.38" data-end_ts="2892.6" title="2892.38" id=c_"2892.38">__or__</span> keyboard writer. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> mm-hmm. <affirmative>, you know, been in the business forever, you know, lived about a quarter mile from me, about a mile from where I'm sitting. Bar <span style="color:red" data-ts="2902.4" data-end_ts="2902.6" title="2902.4" id=c_"2902.4">__talk__</span> wrote one of his piano concertos. So it's, it's, it's been, and yeah, and there's a, this big hotel up on the hill, Grove Park Inn, where Goodyear in Edison and a bunch of those guys used to get together and, you know, plan out the 20th century. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So why is it that Chuckleheads like me weren't aware of it until recently? I mean, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2925.88" data-end_ts="2926.04" title="2925.88" id=c_"2925.88">__is__</span> this just been a well-kept southern secret, or is this it, it, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>It was quite a, a well-kept secret for while, and actually it, it, it really hit a decline in the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2934.77" data-end_ts="2935.12" title="2934.77" id=c_"2934.77">__think__</span> sixties, seventies, and eighties when I first started coming up to Asheville. It was in pretty bad shape, although it was immediately very interesting to me. I, I first really came up here to, go to a Paul Winter concert, Uhhuh, <affirmative>, concert. Sure. And then <span style="color:red" data-ts="2949.4" data-end_ts="2949.56" title="2949.4" id=c_"2949.4">__when__</span> I did, I looked around and said, this <span style="color:red" data-ts="2950.96" data-end_ts="2951" title="2950.96" id=c_"2950.96">__is__</span> kind of cool. And it was, I think because of the natural beauty of the area hiking and stuff, it, it had attracted a little bit more of a counter-cultural following and, a lot of other areas. And I, and I think from some of the old history too, there was kind of a core of artists. I don't <span style="color:red" data-ts="2967.56" data-end_ts="2967.6" title="2967.56" id=c_"2967.56">__know__</span> if you've ever heard of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2968.12" data-end_ts="2968.2" title="2968.12" id=c_"2968.12">__the__</span> Biltmore House? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I have, but I'm not sure in what context. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>It was the one time the largest private residence in the country. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, that's where the Vanderbilt lived. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, okay. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2978.1" data-end_ts="2978.32" title="2978.1" id=c_"2978.1">__All__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>And it's like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2979.88" data-end_ts="2980.08" title="2979.88" id=c_"2979.88">__like__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2980.08" data-end_ts="2980.36" title="2980.08" id=c_"2980.08">__again__</span>, palace. Basically, it's just you on the other side of town from here. It's now a big tourist. They come check it out. But when they were building that, they, they just brought so many artisans in to design, build, and maintain it. And a lot of 'em just wound up staying. So I think there was <span style="color:red" data-ts="2993.84" data-end_ts="2994" title="2993.84" id=c_"2993.84">__just__</span> kind of a core artistic community. Been here since, you know, twenties or thirties or whatever. Right. Of course, Bob Mogue being here once, once that became more well known, particularly when he started getting big <span style="color:red" data-ts="3005.46" data-end_ts="3005.68" title="3005.46" id=c_"3005.46">__bro__</span> going, I think interesting electronic music people started trickling in a little bit, but probably really about the time I started working at Mogue, it seemed like it was really picking up steam. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. Well, I'm gonna have to find a way to get there just for a visit somehow. Oh, yeah. I'm sure I can find something. One of the last things that I want to touch base with you on before I let you go is your site experimental synth.com. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, which is interesting and, and especially is to me, was interesting because that was kind of like one of the locusts where I, I started getting a lot of information from you and not only from the site, but also your postings on Facebook Yeah. To be able to sort of find cool stuff. And then on the experimental <span style="color:red" data-ts="3052.38" data-end_ts="3052.6" title="3052.38" id=c_"3052.38">__syn__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3052.6" data-end_ts="3052.84" title="3052.6" id=c_"3052.6">__site__</span>, you share the videos often as you do, with the postings and social media. What drove you to do that? Was it just the desire to share or was it the extension of kind of the, the chops you got being a marketing person? What, what got you into that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Both, both of those. I, you know, I really kind of started doing that when I was working at Mo, particularly when we were launching the MO guitar. Right. One of the first videos that I did was kind of the initial mo guitar video, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="3081.45" data-end_ts="3081.8" title="3081.45" id=c_"3081.45">__there__</span> was one where, you know, Lou Reed had come to the factory about two weeks before we were gonna launch it. So we went <span style="color:red" data-ts="3086.08" data-end_ts="3086.24" title="3086.08" id=c_"3086.08">__and__</span> showed it to him, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="3087.74" data-end_ts="3088.16" title="3087.74" id=c_"3087.74">__Mutual__</span> had a video camera with him when he played it at first, and when Gaga over it, <laugh> had, him and, Vernon Reed for <span style="color:red" data-ts="3095.92" data-end_ts="3096.08" title="3095.92" id=c_"3095.92">__he__</span> talk a few other on, on <span style="color:red" data-ts="3098.04" data-end_ts="3098.2" title="3098.04" id=c_"3098.04">__their__</span> chumley, I believe is in that one too. And, that video I think now <span style="color:red" data-ts="3102.9" data-end_ts="3103.12" title="3102.9" id=c_"3102.9">__is__</span>, I think it's still the most watched video on the Mogue YouTube channel. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3107.39" data-end_ts="3107.68" title="3107.39" id=c_"3107.39">__that__</span> got well over 600,000 views on it. That was a very early and strong education into the power of social media. And like, I, I did that, you know, quite a bit of that when I was at Mogue and when I left, it was actually, even more fun because I didn't have anybody else telling me how and what to do, you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Know? Right, right. You could run with it. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>When you work somewhere, you gotta, you gotta boss me. Sure. Yeah. But, you know, when I, when I was on my own, it's like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3137.25" data-end_ts="3137.6" title="3137.25" id=c_"3137.25">__would__</span> do whatever the hell I want <laugh>, it's gonna be cool. And it was cool. So it's like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3143.6" data-end_ts="3143.8" title="3143.6" id=c_"3143.6">__yeah__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3143.92" data-end_ts="3144.04" title="3143.92" id=c_"3143.92">__I__</span> really just kind of let my, imagination run wild and <span style="color:red" data-ts="3148.23" data-end_ts="3148.52" title="3148.23" id=c_"3148.23">__feel__</span> myself while I was doing it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, one of the things I like, especially when you kind of roll through the, through the site, is the way that you kind of mix cool things you've seen other people do and sharing that mm-hmm. <affirmative> a <span style="color:red" data-ts="3161.36" data-end_ts="3161.48" title="3161.36" id=c_"3161.36">__lot__</span>, you share that right alongside the stuff that you're doing. Either I, I get the sense that even when you're kind of demoing something, it doesn't seem like a demo as much as you sharing yourself playing, it's, it's almost as much about you playing and composing as it is about the gear, which I can really appreciate because mm-hmm. <affirmative> in the end, when I am looking at acquiring a piece of equipment, I seldom do it because I really want the piece of equipment. I do it because I wanna imagine myself making better music because of that, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3196.76" data-end_ts="3196.92" title="3196.76" id=c_"3196.76">__right__</span>?

And there's something about the way that you do videos that really makes me feel like I'm seeing that happening. So congratulations on that. I think that that's, that's a subtle but not easy to accomplish thing. 
</p>

<p>

Actually, when I first started Experimental Syn, it was just a Tumblr blog that I had pointed <span style="color:red" data-ts="3303.52" data-end_ts="3303.76" title="3303.52" id=c_"3303.52">__that__</span> U r l to. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, I see. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chris: </b>Since switch it over to a, a <span style="color:red" data-ts="3307.68" data-end_ts="3307.92" title="3307.68" id=c_"3307.68">__<inaudible>__</span> backend, I'm actually thinking about, redoing it here pretty soon in WordPress. Just, little easier maintenance. Sure. SoundCloud, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3316.42" data-end_ts="3316.84" title="3316.42" id=c_"3316.42">__that's__</span>, Kry <span style="color:red" data-ts="3317.4" data-end_ts="3317.6" title="3317.4" id=c_"3317.4">__Stack__</span> and Experimental synth on SoundCloud.

<b>Darwin: </b>Awesome. Yeah. Well, hopefully people get a chance to dive into that and maybe, maybe be able to follow you as, as much as I do. 'cause again, it's always eye-opening and fun to see what you're doing. So thanks again for your time and have a great evening.

<b>Chris: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="3336.11" data-end_ts="3336.6" title="3336.11" id=c_"3336.11">__Alright__</span>, you too. You too. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright, bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well there you go. A lot of history talking to Chris Stack One little note, the, item that he talked about that Paul VO would be showing at NAMM turned out to be the, let's see, what was it called? The vo wand, which sort of gives you the ability to do that same excitation factor but do it on your own guitar instead of having to get one his. So it's pretty cool. Addition to the world of electronic music stuff. I want to thank everybody for listening. I want thank, everyone who I got a chance to talk to at <span style="color:red" data-ts="3381.98" data-end_ts="3382.2" title="3381.98" id=c_"3381.98">__now__</span> for hanging out. And that's it for this week. I'll catch you next time. Thanks. Bye.
