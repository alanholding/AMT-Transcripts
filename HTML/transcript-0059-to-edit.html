<b>Darwin: </b>Well, wouldn't you know it? My, stupid blue microphone, U s b podcasting microphone fell apart just in time for this interview. Ugh. Can't say I was a fan of that microphone. Anyway, so farewell. But anyway, so everything's done with laptop, so it's gonna sound a little tinier and a little more roomy. But, hopefully I'll be, steering <span style="color:red" data-ts="37" data-end_ts="37.12" title="37" id=c_"37">__a__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="37.12" data-end_ts="37.32" title="37.12" id=c_"37.12">__sure__</span> SMM seven in the face by next week's interview. In the meantime, enjoy and I'll talk to you at the end. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright. This week I am, pleased to present, as the guest, Ryan Gru Ryan is the founder and the leader, the head honcho. Behind the Loop Loft. There are a lot of companies that do loops, loop packages, but I would say that of the people that I work with and the people whose work I respect, they are all big fans of the Loop Loft. And so when I was, talking to people about some ideas, they were all like, oh, man, if we could find out more about that. So, I reached out and, Ryan <span style="color:red" data-ts="86.18" data-end_ts="86.4" title="86.18" id=c_"86.18">__Gru__</span>, wrote back and was willing to do it. And so now we have Mod <span style="color:red" data-ts="91.44" data-end_ts="91.68" title="91.44" id=c_"91.44">__Board__</span>. Ryan, how are you this morning? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan Gruss: </b>I'm great. Thanks for, having me on. Excited to be a part of this. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, it's, it's really great to have you on too. I think, you know, in, in a lot of cases we've had people who've, done different parts of the, of the music industry, but I think this is, this is really the first time that we've done someone that focuses on loop development, and it's really great to have you, come and tell us a little bit about it. Now, one of the ways that I always start off every podcast is I ask people to talk a little bit about their background. And in your case, I think it would also be helpful, for you to talk a little bit about, the things, kind of the things you do at The Loop Loft to, to make that happen. But then really the background that got you to the point where you're, where I consider a fabulous artist, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="149.56" data-end_ts="149.76" title="149.56" id=c_"149.56">__artists__</span> that you are. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>Thank you. Well, it's definitely a, a long and windy road, but I'll, I'll try to, <laugh> make it a quick story, at least to get to where, to where it is today. As probably many of your guest, I started out, I started off as an still am obviously a, a, a drummer or musician. There's a joke right there somewhere, but 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>Won't, we won't go there. Yeah, I grew up, in Des Moines, Iowa, born and raised in Des Moines. Started drumming at a pretty early age, eight or nine, just, you know, pots and pans until my parents finally caved and bought me a snare drum. And then they finally caved and bought me a drum set. And that led to, you know, drum lessons. And, fortunately my, the school district I was in had a very incredible arts program. So, really got into jazz and the jazz band world and that whole thing, which taught me a lot. And, ended up getting a scholarship to the, Berkeley School of Music in Boston. And went there, for four years where I, I studied, music, performance. I was a music production and engineering major, for a while, which was incredible. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>And <span style="color:red" data-ts="222.12" data-end_ts="222.24" title="222.12" id=c_"222.12">__I__</span>, I learned a lot just even from that first year. But it, it took away from, I couldn't practice anymore. I was always in the studio, you know, working on recording projects right <span style="color:red" data-ts="231.64" data-end_ts="231.72" title="231.64" id=c_"231.64">__where__</span> I wanted just to be drumming. So I switched over to a performance major and, and, and graduated from Berkeley in, geez, 2000. And then as, as most, you know, want to <span style="color:red" data-ts="246.24" data-end_ts="246.36" title="246.24" id=c_"246.24">__be__</span> professional drummers do, I've made the decision either, you know, la New York or Nashville, and I went la well, the rest of my friends all went to New York. So I, I went to LA and, and as a lot of people know, if you go to LA without any, you know, ins, it's a, it's a pretty, pretty tough nut to crack. So, you know, you'd up <span style="color:red" data-ts="267.56" data-end_ts="267.76" title="267.56" id=c_"267.56">__do__</span> climbing the la ladder of wedding bands and corporate gigs and sitting in traffic on the 4 0 5 for three hours. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>And, and I, I soon realized that wasn't the, the town for me, as I heard all the, the fun my friends were having in New York. So packed up my car, drove across the country and ended up in New York, where I just fell in love with the city. And, and that was definitely the place for me. So I landed in New York and, and as a musician trying to survive in New York, you know, one often has to get day jobs. So I was fortunate enough to find out, about a temp agency that was temping for jobs at Atlantic Records, you know, so if I'm gonna work a job in the day, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="310.44" data-end_ts="310.6" title="310.44" id=c_"310.44">__want__</span> to be doing something, you know, music related. So I started temping at Atlantic, just kind of bouncing around from department to, you know, wherever they needed me. And then about two weeks in, just from moving to New York, I landed a job as, Ahad Ergen, who's the founder of, Atlantic Records Atlantic, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>As Amit's assistant. So, pretty wild. I, I know, I, I, I moved to New York and two weeks later I'm answering the phone for Aretha Rankin and Eric Clapton, and all these people calling in to talk to Ahmed. And, you know, listening to demo CDs and opening his mail and, you know, pretty, pretty wild stuff. So I was Amit's, assistant, and then I kind of moved up the, the ranks at Atlantic, into, you know, kind of the creative department and <span style="color:red" data-ts="355.42" data-end_ts="355.64" title="355.42" id=c_"355.42">__the__</span> product management side of things. All, all the while I was still drumming at night too, so, you know, not sleeping a lot, but, you know, gigs at night, Atlantic records during the day. And just kept, kept doing stuff in New York and eventually got into this profession of digital asset management, where, which took me from Atlantic to, you know, Nickelodeon mm-hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b><affirmative>, and handling all their digital files online. And this is like kind of pre way before Dropbox. And, this is when companies were kind of building their own custom solutions to deliver securely, you know, deliver and share, <span style="color:red" data-ts="389.92" data-end_ts="390.14" title="389.92" id=c_"389.92">__dig__</span> digital assets, you know, online with, with, Lang <span style="color:red" data-ts="393.38" data-end_ts="393.7" title="393.38" id=c_"393.38">__Disease__</span> and, partners. So that's where I kind of learned like some technical chops on, on, on the backend, which later on when I would start the Loop Loft would really pay off, but in the meantime, I just thought it was a dumb day job, right. <laugh> just trying to survive. Right. And at the same time, you know, I was, I was playing in bands. I, we were in, I was in a rock band called The Rinse, and we were assigned with Peter Asher, who's a pretty well-known producer manager. Yeah. We, we were assigned to Peter, he was managing us. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>And, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="424.51" data-end_ts="424.73" title="424.51" id=c_"424.51">__and__</span> as the music industry was crumbling, crumbling, you know, almost had deals with Columbia, then an a and r guy would get fired, then almost another deal somewhere else. And, you know, we toured with Maroon five and we did all this amazing stuff, but it was just like, kind of ran its course. And, and I just kind of realized I didn't want to try to make it as being a guy in a band in the music industry. And, I had learned, you know, a lot of production techniques on the Atlantic Records side of, you know, how to create and release something. But I, I just, I just kind of put everything on the back burner for a while and got married and ended up in Boston, at, innovation consultancy called Continuum. And that's where I finally had room to have my drums set up in my house in <span style="color:red" data-ts="466.05" data-end_ts="466.17" title="466.05" id=c_"466.05">__a__</span>, a recording studio, kind of where I could just go down any, any time of the day and, and record. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>So in 2009, I started a blog. It was just ryan gru.com. It's, it's still there, it's still up. I think last time I checked <laugh>, and since I was kind of away from my friends in New York and la I was kind of not isolated, but I was out in the suburbs of Boston <span style="color:red" data-ts="486.67" data-end_ts="486.89" title="486.67" id=c_"486.67">__in__</span> my house with my drums in my studio. I started just recording. My thing was like, I'll just record a loop every day and just post it. And not just a stereo loop, but a full multi-track. I was using Logic at the time, the logic session of whatever I was working on, just kind of like a, a digital diary of, of, you know, me still just being on the drums and sharing content and also kind of learning, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="511.93" data-end_ts="512.33" title="511.93" id=c_"511.93">__product__</span>, product production on a little deeper level for myself. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>So every day I was just, you know, giving away free stuff. And then eventually, Peter Kern at, create digital, music.com, picked up on it and ran a piece on it. And all of a sudden, you know, obviously he has a, a pretty well known blog and was just flooded with traffic and, and people, you know, really digging what it, what it was happening, and asking if I could, you know, record this, record that. So I began a sub, a subscription section on the, on the site where for $10 a month, you could just have access to everything. I was creating like a hundred loops, a month or something like that. Right. Set the goal for, so after <span style="color:red" data-ts="552.44" data-end_ts="552.56" title="552.44" id=c_"552.44">__a__</span> a couple years, I had thousands of loops and, some knowledge about how to, you know, package and sell stuff and distribute stuff online through all my day jobs. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>And hence, the Loop Loft was founded in 2010 with, kind of taking those loops and organized <span style="color:red" data-ts="570.46" data-end_ts="570.5" title="570.46" id=c_"570.46">__and__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="570.5" data-end_ts="570.62" title="570.5" id=c_"570.5">__then__</span> 'em into, into categories. So you could buy a funk pack of all the funk loops I'd ever done, or, or pop stuff, or jazz stuff, and kind of categorizing them that way. So it was a more cohesive, download that you could do. And that was the beginnings of the Loop after 2010. It was just me and my loops. And then, as, as we've grown over the years, we've partnered with different software companies, you know, like Ableton and Propellerhead and, personas and kind of customizing our, our content for their platforms to work a little more, you know, seamlessly and integrated. And then as well, I have gone on to sign a bunch of these, you know, incredible musicians who have joined our roster. Like, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="608.65" data-end_ts="608.73" title="608.65" id=c_"608.65">__mean__</span>, some of my favorite drummers in the world, Matt Chamberlain and Omar Hakeem, and, Joey <span style="color:red" data-ts="614.71" data-end_ts="615.13" title="614.71" id=c_"614.71">__Warker__</span>, and just, just the guys that were my heroes, still are my heroes, you know, growing up. It's, it's amazing to be able to record them and kind of offer their, their drumming, their, their magic d n a that's between those notes, you know, for, for anybody to, to use in their productions. And I guess that kind of takes us to where we are today. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. What an amazing story. <laugh>. So <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>I told you it was long and windy 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. It is, but it's also that, that trail to success that is so common, which is that nobody would've ever made a map that looks like this. Right? Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>It definitely wasn't the way I set out to make a living in the music industry, but I'm, I couldn't be happier. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, so I have to, I have to admit that I am, I'm kind of, it's not like I'm a stalker or anything, but I am, I am incredibly, fascinated by the, the Atlantic story. And so you, you worked as his assistant. To what extent did that give you a chance to sort of like, peek behind the curtains and learn, learn things about the music industry that would help you in some of the other stuff that you <span style="color:red" data-ts="683.61" data-end_ts="683.77" title="683.61" id=c_"683.61">__did__</span>? Or was it mostly just like going to Starbucks for coffees and stuff? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>No, I mean, just, just sitting there. So, you know, his office was kind of in the executive area, so it was him and the, you know, the other chairman and CFOs all kind of in this special section of the, of the headquarters there. And just, just being there and overhearing conversations. And, and he, he would, you know, I would sit in on meetings and listen to demos with him, and it wasn't just, <span style="color:red" data-ts="712.72" data-end_ts="713.01" title="712.72" id=c_"712.72">__yeah__</span>, yeah. You know, there was getting the coffee kind of stuff and running around town and doing what assistants do, but just kind of seeing, being around those guys and, and seeing their vision for, you know, what works and what, learning what resonates with people and, and the marketing's learning that the marketing side is just as important as the product itself. Even though the product must come first, if you don't <span style="color:red" data-ts="735.76" data-end_ts="735.84" title="735.76" id=c_"735.76">__know__</span> how to market it, you, you know, it's, it's kind of the tree falling in the forest, you know? Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and it's interesting because, what you said right there is actually a big, sounds to me, like a big part of your, of your background, because, so, so you do that, you get a chance to see this kind of in the works, but then you do a band, I'm sorry, I didn't catch the name of the band. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>It was called The Rinse, r r i n ss e. So yeah, it was kind of a Brit, the singer was from London and Uhhuh 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative>. All right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>Williamsburg, Brooklyn, mid two thousands kind of thing, <laugh> Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Happening. So, but, you know, you kind of get this sense of, of marketing. You, you are working with Ban, obviously you had to do some marketing to get Peter Asher's attention. 'cause you know, I think of, <span style="color:red" data-ts="788.99" data-end_ts="789.11" title="788.99" id=c_"788.99">__I__</span>, you know, I think of him maybe, from a prior time, but this is the <span style="color:red" data-ts="793.51" data-end_ts="793.67" title="793.51" id=c_"793.51">__same__</span> Peter Asher that was like Linda Ronstadt and 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>These, right, exactly. And he, he ran Apple Records for the Yeah, he was, he was the one that, you know, was in charge of that, so, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So you, you clearly had to do some marketing to get seen on that. But what's interesting to me is that even when we start looking, talking about your blog and the beginning of your sort of like, sample development career, it seems like you were kind of savvy in doing things like, you know, here's a, a loop <span style="color:red" data-ts="827.71" data-end_ts="827.83" title="827.71" id=c_"827.71">__a__</span> day. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>Yeah. It's just, you know, I'm kind of one of those deadline driven people where that's the one way, and just to get traction online, like you gotta be consistent, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, that's, that's what I was gonna say. So often, I talk to people about the thing that they're doing, and they, they don't get the idea that on the internet, what you have to either be is you have to either be consistent or you have to be the brightest fricking star in the universe. Right? Yeah. And it costs a lot of money to be the brightest star. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>Yeah. It's a little easier to be, well, not easier to be consistent, but, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's certainly cheaper <laugh>. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>Cheaper, more 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. And, and what it does is it sort of preferences, you know, work over work over PR money. Right. But the thing that's interesting is that through, through that consistency, you end up on Peter Kern's radar. And I'll, I'll tell you, Peter has got, a quite a lighthouse there in the C D m, environment. It's a pretty amazing, thing that he's developed. And it's, it's interesting to hear that that is what kind of brought people, to bear and, and kind of launched you on your current career path, right? Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>It was <span style="color:red" data-ts="907.21" data-end_ts="907.37" title="907.21" id=c_"907.21">__that__</span>, that one blog post is kind of what, to me, like signaled what I'm doing, you know, resonated, you know? Right. Go back to, you know, the Atlantic thing is like, once you, you see, so, you know, it's that I threw that against the wall and it stuck. And obviously, you know, there was a demand for more. So that's, you know, that's just where I kind of hunkered down, and that's when, you know, the a hundred loops a month, things really just, I was like, all right, well, let's just see where this goes and, and keep pushing. And, and it just kept, kept going up and up. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That's, that's amazing. So, let's talk a little bit about, about the loop locked and, and, particularly some of the production work that you're doing there. So you started off, creating packages of your own work, and I've gotten a chance to experience some of them, and you're pretty freaking drummer <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b><laugh>, thanks. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But, then yeah, you, it seemed like you decided that, that, once this is gonna take off, you, were going to reach out to these people that are like your heroes. And I'll tell you, I, I don't know of anyone who likes rhythmic music that isn't an Omar Hakeem fan. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>Oh, yeah. I mean, just, and he still to this day, like he, he was on the DAF Punk album, the, you know, that's, and you go way back to the weather report stuff, and, you know, just, he's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Just stunning 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>Everything. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And so I'm curious, how is it that you engage with these people? I mean, it's, it's hard for me to imagine you can just pick up the phone and say, Hey, Omar, this is a guy in Boston. Yeah. You want to record some loops for me? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>Yeah. It's, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1015.19" data-end_ts="1015.41" title="1015.19" id=c_"1015.19">__how__</span>, how do most of these, I mean, it's all, it's all connections. It's all <span style="color:red" data-ts="1018.47" data-end_ts="1018.69" title="1018.47" id=c_"1018.47">__it__</span>, luckily, you know, being in New York, I, I lived there for almost nine years, just by being a musician and also working on the, on the record side of label side of things, you, you, your network, it's pretty amazing how quickly and how large it grows over just a few years. And, yeah, Omar was, you know, the, he was actually a connection through one of the, software companies, that, you know, we partner with. You know, somebody there, somebody that I work with, you know, I was talking about, you know, who I would like to record and that his name came up. And, you know, of course, this guy was a, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1056.16" data-end_ts="1056.28" title="1056.16" id=c_"1056.16">__I__</span> happened to be a good friend with him and put us in touch. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>And, you know, Omar had thought about, he'd been approached many times about, you know, doing it, but never, he never felt right about it. Never Sure. And then see something about the lulo kind of, you know, struck a, a chord with them and, and we hit it off. And that's kind of been the same way with a lot of, you know, Matt Chamberlain. And, you know, I, I'd been, you know, on that for years, just, you know, trying to get him and, you know, I think he kind of saw where this was headed and, and I, my consistency for, you know, really just this is what I was doing. And, and, and the, the artist roster was growing. And it's, and, and it's, I I try to kind of approach it kind of like a, a blue note mentality where it's this certain tier, certain level of, of artistry that that is, you know, quality that is there. So, like, you know, back in the fifties, sixties, you would see a blue Note release and you would just know it's, it's gonna be good. It 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Was gonna be great. Yeah. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>So that's just kind of what I aim for on, on the artist's roster side of things. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And that's really interesting that you say that because, I pay attention to, to all the different things that are going on in the music industry. And, you know, I get different mailings from all the different kinds of companies that, that are doing libraries or different sounds and stuff. And, you know, there are some of 'em that are, like this week 59 new releases we have, we have techno country Bluegrass, blues, volume 17, you know, and stuff like this. Right? Yeah. You have taken a really different approach. I mean, both with your own work and with, with these other, other people you've created, you, you've created something that actually does seem more like a label than it does a library company. And, but you've also really focused on classic recordings. I listen to your listen to the work, and I would say that all of it has a timeless characteristic to it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>Yeah. That's, and that's another thing I kind of strive for, is just classic, natural, punchy sounding drums that aren't over affected and produced. And you can always, you can always add reverb to something later or distort something later or whatever. But if, if you don't have a clean, you know, source material, you've, you know, you can't really pull those layers off after the fact. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. And well, it, it reminds me too, you know, when I listen to the stuff, it reminds me how easy it is for the reverb of the day to take a wonderful drum track and turn it into a really cool drum track from 2003. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>Exactly. You know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>Yeah. It's pretty easy to date something with a reverb. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, it is, it is. Because they have such peculiar characteristics, or, you know, what, what you hear a lot of now is kind of like really peculiar, compressor techniques mm-hmm. <affirmative> and how that seems to be stuff that's going to really date things that are done now as having, you know, as, as being 2014 things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>Yeah. Yeah. And the, the one, the really cool thing that that's kind of happening now is people are using our, our loops as kind of learning material. So we don't just offer, we offer stereo loops, of course, like in Recs and Wave and just, drag and drop kind of stuff. But we we're also doing full multi-track sessions. So the Cutup is loops, but you can, you <span style="color:red" data-ts="1273.56" data-end_ts="1273.6" title="1273.56" id=c_"1273.56">__know__</span>, people that are using pro tools, we have complete pro tools templates that you download, and then you can drag and drop a Matt Chamberlain groove in there that has all 15 microphones on his kit. Right. And people are learning how to mix drums and get, dial it in for, you know, their taste. 'cause you know, every song and every production is completely different. You never know what somebody's gonna need. So this, this allows people to, you know, one, have one of the best drummers in the world on their tracks and experiment with mixing that drummer, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1304.6" data-end_ts="1304.82" title="1304.6" id=c_"1304.6">__in__</span>, in their own, because now everybody has a, a laptop as a studio, and mm-hmm. <affirmative>, it's, I've kind of been able to bring these people that nobody had access to, to studios that nobody had access to. 'cause now they have 'em on their computers and kind of be that guy in the middle that's just kind of the middle man for all this, at home production, you know, or not even at home. There's huge musicians and studios that are downloading our stuff, you know, on a daily basis. And it's, it's an exciting time. Definitely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It is. So let's talk about your production process when you do this stuff. My assumption is that you are working in pretty top-notch studios. Do you personally get involved with onsite production? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>Yeah, yeah. I'm definitely, I guess I am, I am the producer on all this stuff, so it's, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1350.86" data-end_ts="1351.14" title="1350.86" id=c_"1350.86">__we'll__</span>, I'll definitely have a couple conversations with the artist, you know, before the session and we'll, we'll talk about where we wanna go and, you know, who's, who's gonna engineer it. And we get all those details sorted out. And, and then we'll just talk about, I like to come in to each session with about 15, you know, tempos and groove ideas. You know, I'll just basically make a spreadsheet of just so we hit a lot of different areas, and, and I usually kind of base it around what I know that drummer <span style="color:red" data-ts="1378.4" data-end_ts="1378.62" title="1378.4" id=c_"1378.4">__to__</span> kind of signature sort of touching on things that they've done in the past, not, I'm not like, Hey, Omar, play the, you know, daft punk groove, but like, let's do something kind of disco and, you know, or Matt Chamberlain like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1392.91" data-end_ts="1393.03" title="1392.91" id=c_"1392.91">__yo__</span>, the one headlight, you know, walls flop, wallflowers, you know, groove, but getting those certain kind of vibes out out of those artists. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>And so, yeah, we'll have the, the list of grooves, and then we basically, you know, just <span style="color:red" data-ts="1404.79" data-end_ts="1404.99" title="1404.79" id=c_"1404.79">__give__</span> me a bunch of different kind of verse feels with variations and some fiddles <span style="color:red" data-ts="1408.77" data-end_ts="1408.99" title="1408.77" id=c_"1408.77">__tr__</span> just pretend your kind of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1409.95" data-end_ts="1410.27" title="1409.95" id=c_"1409.95">__plain__</span> phrases, 16 bar phrases, just, just keep it musical and, and varied and, and, but focused on a certain kind of vibe for each thing. And then there's a lot of switching out of, you know, switching out snare drums and kits and high hats, and that, that makes all the difference in the world as far as variety. And plus we sample those too, so, people can then, you know, if, if they need to recreate stuff or make their own fills or make their own beats, they, they have those sounds, but then they can also use the original grooves that we have. And then it's just a matter of, so we'll spend a day tracking in Pro tools, and then I take, I take everything home with me on a hard drive. And, and the next, you know, month or two is, is spent, you know, editing and cutting everything up and organizing and <laugh>. That's, that's, that's the, the hard part is, is coming home with, you know, 10 gigabytes worth of drum sessions and, you know, cutting it down to, to the final product. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. And I have some questions about that, but before we get there, do you have a, do you have some studios that are your favorites to work at? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>Yeah, a couple. I mean, I've done a lot of recording at, the Bunker in Brooklyn. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1479.94" data-end_ts="1480.06" title="1479.94" id=c_"1479.94">__a__</span> really cool studio. Actually I do most of the stuff in their, their smaller studio, which has this incredible old Neve board. And, it's a nice, it's smaller sized room, so you get a really tight, tight, punchy sound there. That's, that's been good. I love Matt Chamberlain has his own studio in, it's in the Sound City complex. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1502.01" data-end_ts="1502.3" title="1502.01" id=c_"1502.01">__Okay__</span>. I don't know if, if you ever, you saw the Dave Grohl Sound City movie. Yes, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I did. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>Yes. Like, I'm sure many people did. So he's actually in that complex out in Van Nuys, not in the sound original, studio, but the, a smaller one right next to it. Right. And, just an amazing sounding room. And of course, all of Matt's stuff's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1522.84" data-end_ts="1523.06" title="1522.84" id=c_"1522.84">__is__</span>, is all there. So it's just like, for a drummer who was just, you know, you know, a wall of like 50 different snare drums and, you know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Is that there's a picture on your website of, someone working and there's a room with like a shelf of just snare drums upon snare drums. Is that the room? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>Yeah, that's Matt's personal studio 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Well, that's awesome, because I saw that and I was like, well, somebody has got the ultimate tailored workspace right there. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>And, you know, and with the way things are now these days with, you know, labels and budgets, he does the majority of, I don't know, a lot of his work is done outta there because the budgets aren't there to bring, you know, bands into, you know, the, the record plan or Henson Studios for, you know, a month, lock 'em down, you know, they can't do that anymore. So a lot of stuff, you know, is, is, is, you know, him and not just Matt, like a, a lot of, most of the drummers I work with, you know, recording in their project studios or, smaller, smaller places. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That gets to, that seems to be kind of like one of the growing, work areas for drummers is this idea of being a, sort of like the remote drummer for hire. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>As long as you have the work, it, it's, it's, it's great. 'cause you know, you <span style="color:red" data-ts="1601.71" data-end_ts="1601.83" title="1601.71" id=c_"1601.71">__get__</span>, you have all your stuff there and you, everything's dialed in and Yeah. You just, just hit, hit record and go. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Although <span style="color:red" data-ts="1609.43" data-end_ts="1609.55" title="1609.43" id=c_"1609.43">__I__</span>, and it, it seems to me like it's gotta be hard both doing that work, like playing to, you know, playing to someone else's relatively fully formed track. You know, the sense of communally coming up with a groove is pretty much lost in that scenario. When you're working on people, working with people on, doing recordings and stuff, how do you get them to, how, how do you get them to sort of like, lock in? Do you ever do fake production tracks for them to play along with? Do you ever have someone else playing along or is it just literally a guy in a booth playing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>It's been a little bit of everything. I'm trying to think. Especially with like guitar player, like, so <span style="color:red" data-ts="1657.09" data-end_ts="1657.21" title="1657.09" id=c_"1657.09">__I__</span>, one of our artists is, is Mark Kelly, who's the bass player in the Roots mm-hmm. <affirmative>. He's an old friend of mine from, from Berkeley. Anyway, so we were recording in New York, and yeah, so with a bass player, it's kind of just, you know, sit down and play a funky bass groove, you know, <laugh>, that's just, it's you, you gotta give them something a little more to, to latch onto. So I, I, I, you know, brought a hard drive full of, of different loops that I thought would be good, you know, for, for Mark. And yeah, he just, he, so Mark just played along with, you know, 20 different drum grooves, until we had a bunch of different options. And, and then I've also done the thing where I've brought musicians together. So at the Bunker Studio in New York, I brought together, Charlie Hunter, I don't know if you're familiar with Charlie. He's, he's an incredible mind blowing guitar player. He, he doesn't play <span style="color:red" data-ts="1706.05" data-end_ts="1706.21" title="1706.05" id=c_"1706.05">__just__</span>, he plays bass and guitar at the same time, like eight strings, or he is down to seven strings now. But <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>He's down to seven strings. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>Yeah. But he, he has two brains that work, you know, separately. So he, he does the baseline and the guitar parts and Okay. He's on, you know, D'Angelo's Voodoo album. A lot of people probably know him. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>So I brought Charlie in with Eric Harland, who's just this monstrous jazz drummer, and they'd never played together before. So that was really exciting. 'cause it's just like these two legends, you know, like, just again, like some of my favorite musicians in the world, getting them together, together with no rehearsal and just, you know, again, I had a list of like 12 ideas, concepts, and then, you know, they, we'd just talk about a groove and get something happening and, and then just let, let the tape roll. And, and it was amazing what came out of that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. So do you tend to do the kind of thing where you have a session and then that gives you enough material, one big shot gives you enough material to, work up a loop collection? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>Yeah. Yeah. As long, as long as, you know, again, like I always have, I always make sure that we get at least, you know, at least a dozen different tempos and, and styles mm-hmm. <affirmative>. So, and then on each of those, as long as we have five to 10 minutes of a recorded performance, there's enough meat potatoes in there and variation to go in and cut out 12 different verse grooves and 12 different chorus grooves and 12 different fills. And for each, for each style. So at the end of it, you've got this plethora of, of things to pull from. And now with the technology you can, the beauty is you can speed things up and slow them down. So something might've been recorded at 110 B P M and your track is at one 15 and you drop in Ableton and or whatever, you know, you're working in. And there it is. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Have you ever found yourself in a position where it was like, you thought you had it and then you had to go back and then try and recreate the sound and the micing and all that stuff to match? Or, or have you been pretty lucky as far as nailing it the first time? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>Yeah, pretty lucky. I mean, fortunately, like, you know, we've had some amazing engineers working on this stuff too. Like with Joey at <span style="color:red" data-ts="1842.27" data-end_ts="1842.55" title="1842.27" id=c_"1842.27">__Wicker__</span>, we had Darryl Thorpe, who he's engineered, you know. Yeah. Gnarl Barkley and Air and Beck and Radiohead, and, you know, you're working with guys like that. And it's just like, they, they can do no wrong. You know, you come home and you just open up the session and it's just like, just knocks you over how good it sounds. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. It's beautiful. Yeah. That's great. So let's talk about kind of the grinder end of the work then. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, which is formatting for, for output. So in my case, most of the stuff that I bought from you has been, the single shot recordings, that you've done for machine mm-hmm. <affirmative>. But, you do everything from Rex files to Ableton live sessions, to logic sessions, to pro tools, sessions to stereo. You do it, you do all of these different things. What is sort of the order that you find, I mean, what are the things that you're most, you, you, like, you really like working with at the beginning? And what are the things that you kind of grind out at the end in order to, in order to get the product done? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>Yeah. Well, my favorite part in the beginning is, is kind of, well, one opening up kind of the raw multi-track session that we did at the, at at whatever studio. And, that's where I get to really have a lot of fun. 'cause I'm the one that gets to create the first, the stereo mix of that mm-hmm. <affirmative>. So that's where I get to put on my engineering hat and geek out on plugins and, you know, kind of, you know, do my mixes and then I share those mixes with the drummers to, you know, I always want them to be happy with, you know, the end result of, of the mix loops at least. Right. So there's a lot of collaboration and back and forth on that, you know, want more room sound because once it's a mixed stereo loop, it, it is what it is. And that kind of comes back to me wanting to keep things, you know, very dry and natural and not overproduced. Just, just a nice sounding, I want it to sound like it sounded like if you were standing next to the drum kit. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>So that's kind of my favorite part. And then the tedious, you know, editing, chopping part, that's one. Once we have, you know, going through and finding all the slice points of where we're gonna cut everything. And again, I do all that and I, once we have a, a batch of edits of chopped up loops, then I have a team of people kind of scattered around the world via Dropbox, who, who help me, you know, get those in directs and, 'cause that's a lot of hands slicing and editing right there to to Yeah. To really do it right. And you know, apple Loop formatting and stylus rmx. And so yeah, that's, that's really where we kind of earn your money right there is is is the formatting and converting. And, and then there's so much more we're kind of doing on top of that going into next year. I mean, contact instruments. And there's a whole other world that we haven't really got into yet that that is kind of our focus over this next year. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, I was going to ask, especially as you're starting to branch out now, I mean, when I first, when you were first on my radar, other than I think, a couple of libraries, almost everything you did was drums. Yeah. Now you're, you're doing more guitarists, you've got a saxophonist, you got basses coming in and stuff that starts pointing to kind of almost away from Rex files or R M X files and more towards contact and some of these other, kind of high-end sampler formats. So that's something that you see you're gonna end up doing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>Yeah. And it's kind of my concept for the company too. The end vision is, I kind of think it, of it like, like fantasy football for, for music where you can, except you get to like actually make a song out of it. So you, you know, you could get your dream, you know, pick your drummer, pick your bass player, pick your guitarist and jam, you know, or even just <span style="color:red" data-ts="2087.47" data-end_ts="2087.63" title="2087.47" id=c_"2087.47">__wanna__</span>, a lot of guys just use our stuff to jam with or practice with 'cause they want to jam with Omar Hakeem and Right. Not even, not even recording songs, they're just as a practice tool or, but just having the ability to pick and choose like all these, you know, because every artist brings something signature. Like I can hear Charlie Hunter without knowing it's him and just, I'll know it's Charlie Hunter, 'cause it's Charlie Hunter, you know? Right. And same with Omar and Matt and these guys. It's, it's, it's a magical thing that, you know, no, no sample collection can reproduce. You know, it's like that sample collections. I, and I definitely appreciate them and see that there's a need for them out there, but for me, I don't want to record a snare drum at 30 velocities. And, you know, like I, I wanna <laugh>, I wanna, you know, record somebody playing magic on the drums and give that to people. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. And that's the thing that I, I know for myself, because I'm buying these, one <span style="color:red" data-ts="2140.12" data-end_ts="2140.4" title="2140.12" id=c_"2140.12">__shot__</span> things I realize I'm missing out on is, is the air in between the hits being the actual, the actual magic that's being done. But, I'll learn <laugh>. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>But yeah, though, I mean, the one <span style="color:red" data-ts="2154.08" data-end_ts="2154.24" title="2154.08" id=c_"2154.08">__shots__</span> are great. 'cause I mean, they, they are, you know, like I said, we, we didn't do 30, you know, velocity level. I, I wouldn't put any of my artists through that <laugh> that torture. And some of 'em have been through that torture and said they wouldn't do it. So I, I do not blame them. But yeah, it's, it's for, for us, it's all about the performance and, and capturing, putting the humans back into the computers. You know, like it's, I don't care how well you can quantize or program a drumbeat, it's not gonna sound like Omar Hakeem, you know, that's, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's a fact. Now, you said that you, that you actually perform the two track mixes mm-hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b><affirmative>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What are some of the plugins that you use to, because again, and, and you said it, and so I'm gonna follow up with it. This sort of concept of having a, or this sort of like blue note like concept mm-hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b><affirmative>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And, and sort of the, the, the classic or timeless nature of the stuff you're doing. I, I find the mixes to be extraordinarily good. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>Thank you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And, so I'm curious, what are sort of what, for you, in terms of plugins or in terms of, I mean, do you feel like the d a w uses particularly, important? What are the important things for you that help you take these great recordings and honor them by making a great mix? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>Well, a lot of it just comes down to the initial recording process, getting it right the first time and not trying to fix it later. So luck. And luckily, like I said, I've worked with a lot of great engineers on the artist stuff where you just pull it up without any plugins and it sounds, there isn't much work to be done, you know? 'cause they've, you know, in, in the recording process with the preamps and the EQs that we're using, going into the, in, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2268.06" data-end_ts="2268.28" title="2268.06" id=c_"2268.06">__on__</span> two Disc I should say not tape, got it right going in. So, you know, in the mixing process it's more just about, you know, just compression and just a little EQ and just, you know, you know, my favorite plugin is, you know, ozone six right now, just on, on the mastering bus and just kind of, you know, getting things just, just leveled off. Right. And, and, you know, again, I'm not going crazy with, you know, compression on kicking snares that's already been kind of done in the recording process. And I find that takes away a lot of the snap and punch. You know, you compress things too, too hard and you lose all your, your transients. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. It's, I actually was really, negatively influenced early in my recording days, by working with an engineer who he never wanted, he never wanted to have a problem, so he over <span style="color:red" data-ts="2322.56" data-end_ts="2323" title="2322.56" id=c_"2322.56">__compressed__</span> everything. Yeah. And everything just sounded like it was being squirted out of a tuba toothpaste. It was really, yeah. It, it had that negative effect. So that was, that was one of those like really good like counter <span style="color:red" data-ts="2336.98" data-end_ts="2337.2" title="2336.98" id=c_"2336.98">__men__</span> mentoring things, <laugh> mm-hmm. <affirmative> that sometimes we need, we need to see things done wrong so that we know how to avoid them as well, I guess. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But it's interesting you say that, that ozone is, an important player for you because I find that to be one of the few plugins that really focuses, or that really kind of rewards subtlety. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You know, there's enough, there's enough metering and stuff going on that you don't feel like you have to slam something in order to get a, a red light to light up Yeah. <laugh>. And so, but, I, I just find it to help produce wonderful work, but, again, a lot of it has to be, has to be your ear as well. Now I'm curious, going way back to the beginning of your background discussion. You went to, you went to Berkeley and you kind of, you were doing performance, you did some work in the recording. How, how much of, sort of the elements of understanding production came from going to Berkeley? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>A lot of the kind of just one-on-one stuff, obviously. 'cause that's, that's, those are the classes I took, you know? Right. Like literally like, you know, I remember one of the projects that sticks out is learning how to, not that you have to do this much anymore, but, you know, hand slicing, tape and editing, you know, edits and, and just all the, you know, miking techniques and, and just signal paths and just, you know, all the very basic stuff that unfortunately a lot of people today that when they pick up computers and start learning music production, don't know. 'cause they've never worked with actual gear before. And how, how signal A gets, you know, how A gets to B and all the stuff in between that makes a difference. Right. And then, you know, that was, that was a small part of it, but the majority later on I learned was kind of in my New York years. You know, working with the Rinse and going into the studio with guys like Peter Asher and like recording at Conway in la. You know, you know, being, being a drummer and running into the control room and seeing what, how that affected my drums and what, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2467.49" data-end_ts="2467.71" title="2467.49" id=c_"2467.49">__you__</span> know, what does that, you know, what does that knob do to my kick drum? And just watching, you know, these incredible engineers manipulate my stunt. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>That was probably the biggest learning experience was kind of being able to be a musician and, and also kind of really kind of understand what was going on as they were, you know, mixing my drums. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. It's actually interesting you say that, 'cause I've, I've long postulated that one of the reasons that so many bass players become, become producers <laugh> is because they're free to sit in the, in the control room a lot. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>Never thought about that, but that makes a lot of sense. Yeah. They're sitting right there at the desk the whole time. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. And but, it's rare to see a drummer that will jump out from behind the kit and come running up, running into the control room. So, congrats to you for, for that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>No, I definitely, I love Geek geeking out on those sessions. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, the other thing though that came up in regards to Berkeley that I think is actually really interesting and important is the number of times as we kind of mapped your, your history, the number of times that friends you made at Berkeley, or <span style="color:red" data-ts="2544.32" data-end_ts="2544.52" title="2544.32" id=c_"2544.32">__friend__</span> people you got to know at Berkeley ended up influencing your trajectory mm-hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b><affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And I wonder how you think, I mean, is is that, did that end up maybe being the most valuable thing that came out of your Berkeley experience? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>I definitely, yeah. I mean, Berkeley's all about connections and, you know, it's, I mean, I learned a lot there and, and it's, it's a great school. It, it is what you, you know, get out of it so you can go there and just, you know, not be social and not do jam sessions and leave there and not know anybody when you graduate and go back to your hometown and never do anything again. Or you can really immerse yourself. And, you know, I, I would go to Jam Sessions every night, all night long, and that's where I met all my, my best friends who have gone on to, you know, Bob Reynolds, who's the sax player on the loop, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2598.78" data-end_ts="2598.9" title="2598.78" id=c_"2598.78">__l__</span> was my roommate. And, you know, Mark Kelly, who's in the roots, you know, I was playing with him all the time, and John Mayer <span style="color:red" data-ts="2605.38" data-end_ts="2605.58" title="2605.38" id=c_"2605.38">__was__</span> a good friend, was <span style="color:red" data-ts="2606.34" data-end_ts="2606.5" title="2606.34" id=c_"2606.34">__at__</span> Berkeley. And just all these guys, you know, just kind of, you know, you just live and breathe it 24 7 for four years, and then everybody kind of goes their own ways. But you stay connected and your, your web, your web kind of grows, you know, from, from all those connections. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What, what that sort of reminds me of is the way that, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2628.31" data-end_ts="2628.53" title="2628.31" id=c_"2628.31">__if__</span>, if you kind of like read music history, kind of the way that people talk about, during the big band era, you know, people who would, who would be out with <span style="color:red" data-ts="2638.09" data-end_ts="2638.29" title="2638.09" id=c_"2638.09">__the__</span> big band, then when they would start making small groups, they would draw from people that they met in the big band. Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2644.89" data-end_ts="2645.09" title="2644.89" id=c_"2644.89">__But__</span> when they were recording, they would end up using people from those bands and stuff like that. It seems, you know, the big band area era now is long gone, but that, it's, it's almost like in, in your case at least, and I think in <span style="color:red" data-ts="2658.73" data-end_ts="2658.85" title="2658.73" id=c_"2658.73">__a__</span>, in a fair number of cases, the school situation ended up, providing that kind of, that kind of network. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>Yeah, yeah. No, it's, yeah, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2671.48" data-end_ts="2671.76" title="2671.48" id=c_"2671.48">__huge__</span>. Hugely valuable. And I, there's a kid that just graduated from my hometown that's now at Berkeley, and I'm kind of like living vicariously through him again as he's in his freshman year and, you know, doing everything I did with, you know, the jam sessions and, and it's, it's glad to hear that's still going on there. You know, it's still strong, like the, the Musicians network kind of hang thing is, is so important. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. And I, I wonder now, you know, there seems to be more and more, and Berkeley's actually at the front end of the whole online, educational thing. I wonder what is going, how, how that can networking or how that development of connections is gonna continue if people aren't even in the same city anymore. And I also think that it's, it's kind of interesting, you were talking about, the drummer that has his own studio. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>Oh, Matt Chamberlain. Matt 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Chamberlain, sorry. You know, again, this, the idea that, in a lot of cases, budgets, or time constraints or whatever are preventing people from getting together in the studio and work, work together in the studio. And I wonder what the effect of that on sort of musician community, you know, what's, what's that like, how is that changing the way that musicians work with each other? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>I kinda see it two ways, like the, the opportunity to, you know, unfortunately go into a hit factory is kind of gone or the big, you know, and multimillion dollar studios, but now there's more and more home studios where people can set up and record and experiment without staring at the clock and worrying about budgets and, and, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2769.9" data-end_ts="2770.12" title="2769.9" id=c_"2769.9">__and__</span> a more relaxed kind of, kind of casual way. I think there's more opportunity to do that and really experiment and, and be creative. And I think that's where a lot of the music coming out today is a result from this collaboration thing. But yeah, it, you know, it's, again, it's also kinda a shame that you, you know, can't have world class equipment at your fingertips, you know, for a month. And, and really, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2793.6" data-end_ts="2793.76" title="2793.6" id=c_"2793.6">__the__</span> unfortunately those days are, are kind of gone unless you can really afford to have that in your own studio. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Nobody's locking out, studios for a year and a half anymore. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>No. You know, it's, it's not sustainable. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So, boy, our, we've burned through this time in a hurry that's been fantastically interesting. I'm curious, and maybe you don't, maybe you don't wanna open this up, but if somebody said, I want a life just like yours. How do I get started? <laugh>? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>Oh man. I dunno, <laugh>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2828.3" data-end_ts="2828.52" title="2828.3" id=c_"2828.3">__oh__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I mean, first of all, would you even wish that on anyone? And secondly, do you think that, do you think that the door is still open for a guy to just say, I'm gonna do a loop <span style="color:red" data-ts="2839.6" data-end_ts="2839.72" title="2839.6" id=c_"2839.6">__a__</span> day? I mean, 'cause one of the things I I would say is, you know, Peter Kern notwithstanding on getting you started in kind of the commercial work, one of the things I would say about the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2850.87" data-end_ts="2851.16" title="2850.87" id=c_"2850.87">__Lulo__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2851.47" data-end_ts="2851.76" title="2851.47" id=c_"2851.47">__Lulo__</span> is you guys spend a tremendous amount of effort marketing what you do. Mm-hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b><affirmative>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I am never at a loss to what the Lulo is current offering is. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>No. Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But that takes time and takes effort and that takes a focus on marketing. And I would assume that some of that came from your work when you were kind of doing digital content management and stuff, you know, understanding how to do that kind of marketing. But it also, it also points to the fact that that sets a really high bar for someone to just kind of come stumbling in and trying to do the same thing. Do you think that there is opportunity for people that want to pursue a loop development as kind of a career path? Or do you feel like that might already kind of be, occupied by the people that are gonna be able to do it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>I mean, that's a good question. Of course. I would like to, to say, oh, <laugh>, there's no more room just 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Don't try. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>Yeah, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2915.22" data-end_ts="2915.44" title="2915.22" id=c_"2915.22">__no__</span>, it's, it's saturated. No, but there's always room. You know, like if somebody had said that to me in 2008 or oh nine, you know, 'cause there were, were a lot of loop companies back then. You just have to find your own niche and your own spin on it. And my mine was the, the human, you know, kind of human d n a aspect of it, you know, getting, getting that earthy kind of life back into loops. 'cause everything back then it seemed, was very on the grid, e d m, techno <span style="color:red" data-ts="2948.9" data-end_ts="2949.18" title="2948.9" id=c_"2948.9">__based__</span> electronic stuff. And Right. I was just, and I felt a need for just wanting to connect with musicians, even if it was just through loops, like having stuff to play with that foot re So, you know, that's our take on it. But if somebody can find another spin, another angle on it that that opens up another niche in the market, then sure, why not? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, I think that's a, that's a great, a great way to frame it. Again, I think just like, there being a Blue Note record label didn't prevent other labels from existing. I think, I mean, you certainly have have developed a very particular and wonderful angle on things. It's certainly different than what you see from East West or, or many of these other things for that. That's, that's really something to be, celebrated, I think. So what's going to be up for 2015 for Loop <span style="color:red" data-ts="3007.94" data-end_ts="3008.22" title="3007.94" id=c_"3007.94">__Lock__</span>? What are the new things I'm gonna get a chance to buy? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>I'd say stay tuned for some very exciting and interesting, artists announcements. Okay. Some big names, some big household names. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Are you gonna be making noise around namm? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>I will be there, yeah. We <span style="color:red" data-ts="3025.94" data-end_ts="3026.06" title="3025.94" id=c_"3025.94">__wanna__</span> have a booth, but, the Loop Loft will, will be there in full effect walking around and shaking hands and, and saying hi to everybody. So if anybody listening to this wants to meet up, just drop us a line on our website and, and I'd be happy to, to connect with somebody. But yes, we will be there. A lot of my artists will also be there as well. So, should be, should be a fun time. And then just look for, you know, we're, we're, we're doing a lot of kind of, cus we're getting into the, you know, contact world and, and able, you know, more customized live packs and, you know, res working with a reason on some stuff. So look, just look for more integration coming out in two, in 2015. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Fantastic. Well, Ryan, thank you so much for taking the time to talk to me and kind of giving us a, a glimpse inside of your world. I have to say, it's, it's gotta be a lot of fun to be you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>Oh, it's <laugh>. It's a lot of pressure and a lot of fun, but it's, I can't complain. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>All right, well thank you so much. Have a great day. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ryan: </b>All right, you too, Dar. All right, bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And there you have it. I hope you take the opportunity to go over to the <span style="color:red" data-ts="3099.36" data-end_ts="3099.6" title="3099.36" id=c_"3099.36">__loop__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3099.76" data-end_ts="3100.4" title="3099.76" id=c_"3099.76">__l.com__</span> and check out, the kind of work that Ryan's been doing. It's really fantastic and I think his, sort of framing that company as kind of Blue Note records of samples is totally appropriate. Now, I'm gonna take a departure and instead of thanking people, which I kind of do every week because I'm very thankful for the support that you guys give me, I want to kind of change it up for the holiday season here. And I particularly want to talk about something that's come up. A friend of mine, used to work at Spark <span style="color:red" data-ts="3134.31" data-end_ts="3134.6" title="3134.31" id=c_"3134.31">__Fund__</span>. He now, he now is off doing his own thing. Has been very active in East Africa, working with different, kind of maker groups, particularly the Ugandan <span style="color:red" data-ts="3151.85" data-end_ts="3152.2" title="3151.85" id=c_"3151.85">__Fundi__</span> lab, which is sort of an African version of Makerspace. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It looks like a phenomenal thing. He has started a, Kickstarter specifically to, put together a documentary working with them to, to sort of like publicize things. He's asking for a modest amount of money, needs some backers. There's 16 to <span style="color:red" data-ts="3175.24" data-end_ts="3175.48" title="3175.24" id=c_"3175.24">__gate__</span> days to go into Kickstarter. I'm gonna ask you, it's, it's by Lynn Craig Teched. But if you, it's called d I y technology in East Africa, a documentary you could probably search around in Kickstarter to find it. Otherwise if you go to art <span style="color:red" data-ts="3195.28" data-end_ts="3195.6" title="3195.28" id=c_"3195.28">__music__</span> tech.libsyn.com, which is the home site for this podcast, I'll make sure that there's a link there. But, do me a favor. I don't really ask for money on the podcast because it doesn't seem appropriate, but what I would like you to do is at least go and check out Lindsay's project, see if it's something that you're interested in supporting. And if you are, please pledge on that. Other than that, I hope that you have a great holiday season, however you celebrate it, and I will be Back next week with some more good stuff. Thanks a lot. Great day.
