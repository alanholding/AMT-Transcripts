<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today I have the, great fortune to first of all get barked at by a dog named Bubbles. And secondly, <laugh> to talk to Mariel v Jacobson's. Mariel has been doing some really interesting work lately. She's, got a release coming out. There's a lot of activity, kind of buzzing around, her head right now. So, with that, I am going to say hi to Mariel. Hi, Mariel. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle V Jakobsons: </b>Hey, I'm good. How are you doing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm all right. So rather than me, list out what all you're doing, why don't I have you tell people what you're doing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>Okay, sure. Well, I just a couple weeks ago released a brand new album called Star <span style="color:red" data-ts="61.395" data-end_ts="61.685" title="61.395" id=c_"61.395">__Core__</span> on Thrill Jockey records. And, along with that, I've been touring for the past month or so in a few places, and performing as a live audio visual experience, with Chuck Johnson on base. And then I perform, with violin, flute, voice, mixing synthesizers and, as well as triggering the video. Also, been working on some, some new videos after this first iteration. So continuing to work on videos with my macro and my somatic instrument. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, why don't you explain what that is, because that is, that kind of rolls off your tongue. Macro, somatic instrument <laugh>, but most people won't know what the hell you're talking about. True. So why don't, it's true. You explain a little bit. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>It's true. I did make it up, when I don't blame anyone for scratching their head when I say it, and sometimes even after I describe it, they're like, I think I understand, but I'd like to see it <laugh>. Right. So the, it's a visual music instrument that I built, and it translates sounds into the motion of water or a fluid, and then I capture that at the macro photographic scale. So very, very close <span style="color:red" data-ts="149.585" data-end_ts="149.805" title="149.585" id=c_"149.585">__up__</span>. And so the result, and also there's, programmed LEDs that are part of the instrument itself. So what you end up having is sound being translated directly into light. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Why don't we just, right away, let's go ahead and, and give a web address so people can go and check out the images that this thing produces. So where's the best place for them to see this in action? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>Yeah. If you go to my website, mariel jacobson.com, you do have to figure out how to spell that. Right. Hopefully Google can help you a little bit with that <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. And I'll, I'll make sure that I put a link on the, on the show notes as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>Okay. Yeah. The, yeah. The funny thing is that there's K and o's in the last name <laugh>, and it gets everybody every time. But, it's actually Latvian in Origin, if that helps anyone. Oh my God. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. So now when I saw the, some of the video that I saw this, I really want to see this live because some of the video that I saw was mind bending because you show shots of how you do it. And then I see the macro work, and I don't know if there's like visual illusions or how much processing you're doing, but just amazing stuff comes out of it. It's crazy. And, you know, some stuff which I assume is like being generated because of the way that the lights are interacting and sometimes maybe shadows or something. I have no idea. There was some amazing stuff coming out of that. Thank you. Oh, thank you. How much of a surprise was the result? Or is this the kind of thing where you're on the 80th iteration of making the thing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>There's always, there's always surprises. There's very little that's a hundred percent reproducible on it from, from moment to moment. So there's, for me personally working with it, the instrument, it's, inculcating a sense of wonder at the natural environment and the processes that are happening around us all the time. And so I'll look at it and, you know, be amazed <laugh>, over and over again. And, so I'm really glad that that amazement is translating through the images. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, it really, it really was. I was, I was kind of floored because it's a simple concept, but the way that you've implemented it's, it's clear that, you've done something special. 'cause the result is pretty fantastic. Now, let's Oh, thank you. Yeah. Let's talk a little bit about this, the album that you just put out. Starco Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I had a chance to listen to it. It was really quite, quite enjoyable. I had heard the, one of the earlier albums that you did, glass Canyon, Uhhuh 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b><affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I had heard that, and to me that sounded like some instrumentation and some acoustic instruments and kind of like processing a bunch of stuff through <span style="color:red" data-ts="336.185" data-end_ts="336.405" title="336.185" id=c_"336.185">__Max__</span> or other digital means. You know, it kind of sounded computer musicy. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, this new album doesn't, it sounds like some kind of really weird acoustic and analog mix, but it seems like there's very little, at least to my ears, it came across <span style="color:red" data-ts="354.505" data-end_ts="354.725" title="354.505" id=c_"354.505">__as__</span>, as being very much less computer musicy. And I'm wondering why that would be, because actually, in the Glass Canyon album, you actually kind of list it as being sort of like violin and analog sense. You don't even really talk about it being that processed. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You know, you don't say anything like that with the current one, but to me, I was, I, I found it really rich and organic sounding. Was there a big change in instrumentation or just recording process, or did you just find a different composition compositional track that led to that? Or am I making it up? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>Oh, yeah. Well that's, that's an interesting, an interesting comment, which I haven't actually heard before. So, okay. Glass Canyon, I do, consider it mainly violin and synthesizers. There is a little bit of max processing on the violin here and there, but the main explorations are more, in the Tamil realm. So it's interesting though that it, comes across as more digital and sound. I do think that the new album focuses on a wider array of instruments and is more grounded in their, those acoustic elements. Whereas the violin on Glass Canyon is a little bit more isolated. I think it's just violin and fender roads might be the only two instruments on there. Oh, interesting. Besides synthesizers, so, which also appear on, starco, however, that's also accompanied by bass and voice and flute, of course, which is much more overtly melodic. I think that part of that might also be the style of the melodic style of Glass Canyon is much more subtle. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, <span style="color:red" data-ts="473.965" data-end_ts="474.165" title="473.965" id=c_"473.965">__me__</span>, that might be why it kinda came across as computer musicy too, to my ear, you know? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> where the new thing is. I don't know. Melodic is actually a great way to put it. So I did notice the voice being used in, in Starco. Is that have, have you used voice before in, in your recordings? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>No, actually. Well, there was, I think some, some backing vocals of some like oohs and ahs on one date, poems track, but it was really, really buried in the mix. But so never, never in the forefront as a main melodic element. We can certainly say that. Right. And so for, for me, it's really the first time using my voice. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So how, how weird was that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>Oh, it very, very strange. <laugh>, I definitely went through a lot of back and forth and <laugh>, <laugh>, you know, using voice is so loaded, it just, you know, everybody's perceptions of it are gonna be so much richer because of our, our humanness <laugh>. Right. And adding that, that human element and language is so just so loaded. And, so I definitely considered very carefully and wanted to approach in a very minimalist way so that it wouldn't be overwhelming. It would kind of almost be like another instrument rather than voice as the leading element. It's just, just like the, the violin or cheating it, like the violin or the flute. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I mean, to, to be clear, you're not singing, <laugh>. So however, or, you know, you're not, singing a song, you're, you are using it really as kind of a ambient instrument. And it's, it's really cool. It's a nice addition. I, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>It's, oh, thank you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>All of these kinda things. Really what it kind leads to is this kind of really complex picture of an artist. You're doing visual work. You've worked in, you've worked with the Dave Palms in a band type environment. You've done these solo releases where you're kind of experimenting along multiple different axes. I am always curious, and one of the things I like doing in my podcast is exploring where people have come from, how they got to be the artists that they are. And in your case, I'm really curious about it because it, it seems like you're very accomplished in multiple realms, and I'm wondering how you got there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>Well, I definitely started on the violin as my main creative focus from the early, early, very early age of four <laugh>. And so I came at that point, I entered into the world of kind of serious classical violin study and continued along that path for a while. And that also included the piano and whatever other instruments I could convince my parents to, to buy for me <laugh>. Right. So I was, I was pretty voraciously into, performing music at that time, growing up throughout, growing up. And it didn't really come across creating my own, composing my own music until much later. I would have to say that would be in college, actually. And, in college I was started off as a piano performance major and pre-med double major. Ended up dropping the med, but still continuing to take a lot of science classes, which were a big inspiration to me <span style="color:red" data-ts="697.705" data-end_ts="697.925" title="697.705" id=c_"697.705">__and__</span> my work. And I think still are, I also injured my hand. And so I ended up not doing as much piano performance as I, had intended or dreamed of at a certain point. And found the electronic music lab in the basement of the Cleveland Institute of Music, got started using MIDI and some synthesizers. And that's, that was much more, interesting to me than kind of fighting against the, repertoire 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Right. Well, it's interesting <span style="color:red" data-ts="732.305" data-end_ts="732.525" title="732.305" id=c_"732.305">__you__</span> Yeah. The 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>Earlier centuries. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. It's interesting you say that though, because you jumped from an instrument that has a almost a strict marching orders for the repertoire that you learn over, over time to a set of instruments where there's practically no set repertoire. Everything has to be composition. And so you probably, you know, were pretty well pushed into that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>Yeah. And I was delighted at that time, <laugh>, I was <laugh>, I was having a lot of friction with my teacher about repertoire, and I started improvising on the piano and started composing at that time. And I really wanted to be focusing on modern music, you know, 21st century music and not music of old. And, you know, she did, she was also a contemporary piano performer. And so I was like, you know how to play this stuff, teach me that <laugh>. Right. Can we forget about the other stuff? <laugh>. Right, right. And it just, she's just like, it just doesn't work that way. You know, we could sprinkle in a little stockhouse in here and there, but you can't just focus on it. So that kind of bummed me out. So when, when I ended up getting redirected, I was very inspired by the freedom, you know, went, went from there to, to Paris where a year actually to study computer music. And so continued on that realm over to Mills College, where I got to start exploring more of my ideas of creating instruments and working with Max and creating installations and more experiments in the, the broader sense of artistic production, as well as honing in on my, sound and music skills. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Right. Now, do you mind me asking, you said that you injured your hand and that kind of led to some of the changes that, that you faced. What, what kind of injury was it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>Oh, it was, we can blame it on Bar Talk <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You probably wouldn't be the first person. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>Yeah. Bar Hawk, you know, I guess he had really big hands, <laugh>. Oh, geez. Oh my goodness. And, you know, I was really trying to play the music Percussively, and I was having a lot of fun playing the music Percussively. Right. But unfortunately, my body was not, not having so much fun with the results. And, so because it was a, that's interesting because it was happened on the piano, even over months of therapy, and it just, it wouldn't, it wouldn't go away. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, I'm, I'm interested to hear that you, you went to Mills and that kind of lit you into, into instrument building, because that seems to be kind of a common thread between a lot of people that I <span style="color:red" data-ts="908.085" data-end_ts="908.325" title="908.085" id=c_"908.085">__talk__</span> to, you know, certainly, like Ben Bracken and Ashley and, and, these folks, you know, they, they're definitely into instrument building. Was there something about the program there that is kind of specifically introduces you to that as a practice? Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>I think that, actually there is quite a bit of support there. Right now for instrument building. When I was there, there was support, but maybe not as many structured classes about that. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But, what really got me to go there was that I was looking for programs that weren't so, so very, strictly defined as to what composition was and what the creative process for composers should be to get your master's degree. And so that kind <span style="color:red" data-ts="957.165" data-end_ts="957.245" title="957.165" id=c_"957.165">__of__</span> open-endedness and the ability to explore creating things, physical objects as well as software objects was what <span style="color:red" data-ts="967.745" data-end_ts="967.965" title="967.745" id=c_"967.745">__it__</span>, you know, what, what was exciting to me. So I do think that a lot of the instrument building itself came from the community that was there. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, for example, my friends Ben Bracken and Agnes Schlagg and other amazing artists that I was there at the same time as who, were very inspired by works of art that connected people in through space. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>You know, together we discovered, you know, or I discovered James Turrell, for example, through, through this community Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1002.765" data-end_ts="1002.845" title="1002.765" id=c_"1002.765">__And__</span> that kind of blew my mind, <laugh>, and I was like, how can we create a sonic experience that could parallel that level of perception, play with perception as a James Trell piece might, for example. Sure. So, yeah, I think that a lot of the, the interest and interest in instrument building to come from the place and time that I was there, as well as the freedom, what you could explore there, and the varied instrument, I mean, the faculty there has so many different interests and layers to their interests. And, it was also fun to be able to go to the California College of Arts and take a class there in interface design, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1045.605" data-end_ts="1045.925" title="1045.605" id=c_"1045.605">__which__</span> was actually where I built what I consider my first instrument, which was the self oscillating violin. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Yeah. I saw a video, I saw a video piece of that, and, you know, I, I saw that. And then I saw, some videos that you have on your site, one, which is like, you <span style="color:red" data-ts="1062.245" data-end_ts="1062.325" title="1062.245" id=c_"1062.245">__were__</span> at a conference where you had like a little speaker with a thing. And I just came to realize that an awful lot of your, particularly your performance work seems to be oriented on this idea of like, vibration and sympathetic vibrations or activated vibration. What's the fascination, where'd that come from? I mean, what was like the first time you saw something move like that and you said, oh, there's, there's something there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b><laugh>. That's a really good question. Yeah, it was probably around the time that, that first video that you saw. Yeah. I can't quite imagine what the first time itself was that I thought that, somatics would be an interesting thing to explore. But I might've been for that, particular class, which was focused on, media arts and video production and stuff like that, where I wanted to start to think about the visual elements that seemed like a direction that was really interesting to me in its ability to, draw people into the sound. I was starting to work with minimalist violin and, just sign wave synthesizers. Right. Which was my early Darwin's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1143.125" data-end_ts="1143.285" title="1143.125" id=c_"1143.125">__bitch__</span> project. And I think that that, that type of work lends itself well to matics, working with sine waves already and trying to pair sounds down to their simplest elements. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. What is the thread then that kind of took some of these basic, these basic elements and turned in, because the, the thing you're working with now, your, and I have to actually look it up here, the macro sematic visual music instrument. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, that's actually a pretty complex structure. You know, you've got, you've got this press, it's a rosin beast like platform, right. That holds some water, but then it's, it's a pretty complex set of lights all the way around it and over it. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you use what you use just like a standard, DSLR camera for capturing, transmitting or something else. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>Let's start with the soundboard Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Of the 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>Instrument <laugh>. So that's, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, because it's like, there's so many, there's so many moving pieces here. I, it's like, you know, you started off with like a violin on a pedestal and you somehow ended up with to this contraption, I'm trying to imagine like the through line that connects those things, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b><laugh>. Yeah. I, to me, I think that the, the through line is trying to create a, a visual object that can also be thought of and is, is an actual, musical instrument in its own, in its own right. And so thinking of things both in a sculptural way and in, their, so with their sonic properties in mind. And so I think that that's one, one aspect. And to talk a little bit more about the instrument, the macro sematic instrument itself, it did start off with wood in a more traditional instrument fashion where Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, it was, I carved actually a little divot to create a little pool for the liquid. So I actually carved that by hand, you know, very much thinking of myself <span style="color:red" data-ts="1266.785" data-end_ts="1267.005" title="1266.785" id=c_"1266.785">__as__</span> an instrument builder in the traditional sense. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, like a violin maker would Sure. Carving the back of the violin and, and taking cues from that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1276.285" data-end_ts="1276.525" title="1276.285" id=c_"1276.285">__thing__</span> that, you know, the sonic properties of wood. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>And particularly I was tried out a bunch of different types of wood and cedar was working really well, and I was like, oh, well, I guess that makes sense. You know, a lot of, instruments are built with cedar, and now I can see why <laugh>. Right. It does have a flatter frequency response, than some of the other more porous woods or the really hardwood that are just very difficult to carve and work with. Sure. Right. Right. So I learned a lot about that <laugh>, you know, I started to, started to move away from thinking of it as a more, and actually that first one also had a string on top. So <span style="color:red" data-ts="1317.145" data-end_ts="1317.365" title="1317.145" id=c_"1317.145">__to__</span> complete that thread of the more traditional instrument in creating a sound object with it, the first version of the macros sematic instrument did have a string on top with a bridge, and it was carved from wood, so 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Right. So it was like a proto violin at that point. Yeah. Or meta violin. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>Yeah, <laugh>. Then, and that was created the dresser ensemble residency. That was the first time that I was working with wood and had the great opportunity to have access to the wood shop as well as their performance space. So I could go back and forth, modify the instrument, and then go hook it up with my camera and see the result right away, and then go back and forth. And that was so helpful because it is a rather complex creation. There's so many different elements, learning the camera. Then later on came the lights. So after the woodworking, I was creating videos at the, another residency called Gisi. And along the road I had an idea that I was actually creating certain types of shots visually because of the wood grain. And I, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1386.905" data-end_ts="1387.125" title="1386.905" id=c_"1386.905">__the__</span>, there were moments where I didn't wanna see a wood grain in the background. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>Sure. And so the thought came to create a, the instrument to be clear. And I was like, well, how's that possible? How's that even gonna work? Is it going to vibrate properly? I don't know. I'm gonna have to just try it out. And so I did some research in, into some materials and found cast of resin, and I decided to create a, a mold that resembled the wood instrument. And I, so I molded it with clay, ceramic clay, and then, poured in the, the resin and let it dry, and then popped it out, and it was like, all right, let's see if you can vibrate properly. <laugh> <laugh>. So it's definitely different, but it, it doesn't vibrate perhaps as evenly <span style="color:red" data-ts="1440.825" data-end_ts="1441.045" title="1440.825" id=c_"1440.825">__and__</span> it's frequency ranges as the wooden instrument, but what it allows me to do visually is far greater. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. It doesn't necessarily have an imprint that it presses into every image. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>Exactly. Or the imprint's just very different. It actually looks very, space <span style="color:red" data-ts="1458.965" data-end_ts="1459.245" title="1458.965" id=c_"1458.965">__like__</span>, which I love <laugh>. That's cool. I was working on the videos for Star <span style="color:red" data-ts="1463.365" data-end_ts="1463.605" title="1463.365" id=c_"1463.365">__Core__</span>, so. Right, right. I thought that was, that was another just stroke of amazing wonder that the shots that I could get on there started to look, like interstellar landscapes to me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So what do you, what do you use as a transducer to get the, to excite the board? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>Yeah, it's just, a small transducer that I stick on the bottom of the board. There's not too many that are created right now, and I can't remember the brand name of it right now. I know I got it from parts express.com <laugh>. So if you look for, an exciter transducer on parts express.com, you will find the, like, one and only stick on 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>Transducer that's, out on the market right now. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Alright. Well 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>That's, I, we need <span style="color:red" data-ts="1508.805" data-end_ts="1508.885" title="1508.805" id=c_"1508.805">__us__</span> to say I bought like 12 of them at least <laugh>, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, because it's just, you know, it's one of, it's, it's sort of an oddity when you actually start thinking about, you know, thinking about this as an instrument, all of a sudden, it's not just the parts that you see, but all the parts that make it work too. Right. And I was curious Yeah. To know, you know, what even worked for a trans, you know, if you, if you had a, you know, just a big speaker or if you had literally a physical transducer 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>Yeah. It definitely wants to be vibrated directly, physically 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Excited. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>Phy Yeah. Physical contact is, is pretty important, is crucial actually. I mean, the sound would have to be so loud to be coming through the air only. Right. And move <span style="color:red" data-ts="1552.665" data-end_ts="1552.885" title="1552.665" id=c_"1552.665">__and__</span> move the actual, soundboard enough to see, to see the water also moving. Sure. So there's definitely a lot of factors involved. It's funny, the, the wooden instrument too was so touchy about like the humidity of the room, the temperature. Right, right. So that was, you know, a learning experience of trying to perform live visuals on that instrument and just, you know, knowing that every time I was gonna set it up, it was gonna wanna be set up a little bit differently. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>Right. So, the nice thing about having the resin casted, it has a plexiglass base is that once it's set up, I pretty much know, how it's gonna vibrate. So that at least takes one factor down a little bit <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Right. Yeah. Because I imagine it's like, it, it could be, it could be endless, the variations that you run into and not always positive variations. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>Oh yeah, definitely. There's, there was a lot of frustration with just, getting, getting it to vibrate properly and reproducibly <laugh>. Right. And I do feel like the latest version can do that in, in a much better way. So it's still very touchy to set up. So I don't travel with it. <laugh> very, I've played like a, I've played a couple times live <span style="color:red" data-ts="1633.205" data-end_ts="1633.285" title="1633.205" id=c_"1633.205">__vis__</span> with live visuals, but a lot of the time, most of the time now I'm working with pre-recorded video files that are synchronized to the audio that you're hearing. Oh, okay. And to me, that I think is the, the most reasonable way until I get a, an awesome team to tour with me. <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You can just, what you can just have is make sure that there's a mold in every city and you just Right. <laugh>. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>Right. Just created exactly this spec <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's right. Right. Send have it in your rider, you know, <laugh>. Right. <laugh>. So, now this thing also, you've got a, about a zillion lights surrounding this thing, and you, you make a point of, of mentioning that they're programmable LED lights. Yeah. How, how much manipulation of lights do you do? Do you have like a big programmatic, programmatic system that kind of ties to the music sensing as well? Or is it fairly simple brightness management? What, how do you, 'cause again, looking at the result, I have no <span style="color:red" data-ts="1698.285" data-end_ts="1698.445" title="1698.285" id=c_"1698.285">__height__</span>. I have no idea how, what I see as a physical device gets to the end result. So I'm just like curious about how, what are the influences of each of these pieces of material? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>Yeah, absolutely. And it, you know, I have to just say that I love that about it. That you, you can't really, you know, I, and I love to talk about the instrument in a very, simplified way because the end result, all the technology that's underneath it kind of doesn't even matter at <span style="color:red" data-ts="1728.525" data-end_ts="1728.565" title="1728.525" id=c_"1728.525">__that__</span> point point. It's really just the evaporate experience of it. But I do love also to get it to the nitty gritty. And I have so many ideas about, all the other things that I wanna create with it. So the lights, the programmable lights are actually a very new edition as well. They came around just when I was at Gisi this spring, I had been working with fixed lights and gels before. So just, you know, gooseneck LEDs from like Ikea. Right, right. And so also very difficult to get the same angle of light <laugh>, the same <span style="color:red" data-ts="1761.065" data-end_ts="1761.285" title="1761.065" id=c_"1761.065">__tie__</span>, you know, same, the, the right, just the right way every time. Or if you move it, it's just gonna be a big jumble. I was like, I need to, and also the hues that I was getting from the gels are super saturated all the time. And not just not a lot of, not a lot of definition. I couldn't change the hues for different parts of songs, you know, so <span style="color:red" data-ts="1783.045" data-end_ts="1783.205" title="1783.045" id=c_"1783.045">__it's__</span> like, not a lot 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Of subtlety. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>Not a lot of subtlety I had. So I was like, I need to, I need to figure this out. I hadn't worked with LEDs before. But luckily it's a great time to start working with LEDs. 'cause there's so many, awesome products out there right now. And, libraries. So I ended up getting some LEDs and hooking them up. And, what I ended up doing was just writing programs per each part of a song and creating like beats per minute synchronization, depending on what song it was. And that might coincide with shifts in hue or direction of the light, or having the light patterns moving up and down, the matrix of LEDs. So everything that I've been programming so far has been not as perhaps elegant as it could be if I built a system, a more interactive system, which is on my to-do list <laugh>. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But, for the immediate moment, I'm just programming each song individually in a way or <span style="color:red" data-ts="1849.365" data-end_ts="1849.525" title="1849.365" id=c_"1849.365">__every__</span>, every part of a song individually as its own program and uploading that, to an Arduino and, just letting that run and recording it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. And then how much processing do you do with the video image on the back end? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>Not a ton. There's a little bit of layering that'll happen, a little bit of color correction here and there is, I might decide this hue or this layer looks better with this layer if the hues are a little bit, matched in a different way. But, I try to keep it pretty, pretty close to what the instrument's giving because technical limitations, to be honest. So I am using A-D-S-L-R-A Canon D 60, which is not a very, very sensitive, camera, but the light is traveling through very, very long tube Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> in order to get the macro photograph effect. Right. And so the amount of light that's actually reaching the sensors very, very small, even though I have all these bright LEDs shining on the water. And so the, there is a lot of limitations as to what kind of shots I can make and look good and the amount of processing that I can do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>And I don't honestly think it needs a lot of processing necessarily. But, there are a lot of kinds of shots that I'd like to do. If I only had about $8,000 for a camera <laugh>. I was playing around with a lot of different camera gear this summer while I was making, the video for White Sparks. And I was, I had some ideas for shots and I was like, you know, reaching what I think is the limits of this camera, I don't think it's the limits of what I could do with this instrument. I think it's the camera. And, I realized that it was gonna be a very big difference in price from to, to get the, the kind of results that I was, imagining. Sure. So, but it's pretty amazing what I could do with that little rig. I just, it was a few years ago, I bought that camera just thinking, I wanna do this macro stuff. I need something to play around with This Seems like a good camera. Right. <laugh>. And it's kind of amazing how the images that I, that I get with it, I'm, I'm really impressed with that, that piece of gear <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You know, as you say, to go through the macro, photographic process, it's going through an awful lot of lenses to maybe a not completely super sensitive sensor. Maybe sort of the artifacts of that actually are some of the, some of the charm factor too. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>Yeah. Yeah. It does. One of the nice things about the camera is that it has this kind of fuzzy, almost filmic quality, which Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2022.425" data-end_ts="2022.645" title="2022.425" id=c_"2022.425">__If__</span>, if you get maybe the latest and greatest, 4K HG camera doesn't have that, doesn't have those nice fuzzy, almost filmic, look to it Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But it might be able to go to a really high ISO <laugh>, but <laugh> tradeoffs. Yeah. So tradeoffs. Yeah. But you know, it's, so there are, there are definitely some qualities of the camera that I know that I'm playing to. And, I, I appreciate, how much it can do with kind of so little. I, it's really just one lens, which I actually had since, since I was a girl in high school, taking my photography class in dark room class. And I actually spent a lot of time in the dark room, in high school. And, I had this, I had, you know, a cannon camera and a few lenses, and this is actually one of the lenses that I've had since then. That's the lens that I use on a bellows, in order to create those effects. So I know 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, do you ever, do you ever miss, the old days of dark rooms and playing with chemicals? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>Yeah, I mean, there was a moment when I got to GI <span style="color:red" data-ts="2101.575" data-end_ts="2101.925" title="2101.575" id=c_"2101.575">__Rossi__</span> and I, I was, I was just settling and I was like, oh, hey, where should I put, I have all these cases from all this equipment, you know, <laugh>. And they were like, oh, if you just go up those stairs, you can put it in that room. And I like, opened the door and I was like, this is a dark room <laugh>, I'm putting my cases in a dark room. And who, nobody told me there was a dark room here. I was like, man, I would've brought a whole different set of stuff. Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2128.425" data-end_ts="2128.645" title="2128.425" id=c_"2128.425">__The__</span> 'cause the thought of making some of these macro sematic photographs I've been making also photographs on the instrument, making prints with them and showing them at galleries. And I've been very excited about that direction. And the fact that I had a dark room just steps away from me, but didn't have any of the materials to, execute anything with that was a little bit disappointing. I think that the effect of, the effect of actually creating your photographs and the, the difference in process where develop you're developing your film and is something that's so, so physical and tangible and, to me it still has a very, very nostalgic <laugh> feeling. <laugh>. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>I do wonder what I could do now with all the, all the work that I've been doing visually, what, what would happen? So I guess, next residency maybe <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, if you think about it though, the whole process of photography, if, if you consider it that the processes that go behind any kind of artwork, all of the processes are, are part of where the artist can have an effect going from film technology to digital, basically lopped off half of the photographic photographic process. You still take the pictures. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But the whole process of manipulating the stored image into the real image, that's Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> largely gone. That process, that part of that opportunity for the artist to, to affect the result, it's largely gone. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>Well, there's Photoshop for that <laugh> Oh 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>Yeah. <laugh>, it's true though. It's, it's now done in that digital realm and, rather <span style="color:red" data-ts="2239.035" data-end_ts="2239.195" title="2239.035" id=c_"2239.035">__than__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Seems a lot different to me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>Yeah. It's, it is very different. I think that, you know, when you're manipulating light directly, there's, you're, the, the understanding and the results that you can get are very different. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So I wanna talk a little bit more about the music and the composition work that you do. In the end, you took an approach that, was an art approach rather than a music approach. So you got, your MFA at mills rather than trying to get your music doctorate or something like that. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I, I took a similar approach as, as have a number of people I know. And I think that that's becoming sort of an accepted and, and an interesting way for someone to go if their view of composition is more complex than, placing new notes on sheets of staff paper. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>Yeah. Yeah. And that's definitely what, what harolded me over to Mills was the fact that there was a program, and at that time there were a few other programs as well who, allowed the, musician and composer to take a more artistic approach. I do think that there's even more options for that these days as, there's a lot more also trade schools for, you know, audio production as well as art, as music and, sound work being incorporated into art schools in new ways. And so that's, I mean, I think that's a pretty exciting development for, for new artists who are just trying to figure out the way that they might want to work with different materials and sound might just be one of those materials. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So when you are doing your composition work, what, what are the things that drive you? Are you driven by <span style="color:red" data-ts="2361.995" data-end_ts="2362.285" title="2361.995" id=c_"2361.995">__tamr__</span>? Are you driven by, the compositing process of bringing multiple, different instrumentation together? Are you driven by melodic lines or percussion, percussive lines? What are the things that that really kind of draw composition out of you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>Well, I do think, a little bit of all of the above. <laugh>, of course, in their own way. I think that my sense of rhythm, because I am a, I started on the violin and I do believe that that was very formative to my approach to music and continues to be, to my approach to composition. The, the focus is on melody more than, rhythm. So I've always been a little more focused on the frequencies that you're hearing and the execution of those frequencies. Not necessarily as much with beats and meters, although of course that's a part of the music. Somehow my brain's always been more focused on the nuances of timbre as part of the performance and part of the sound that you're creating. I think that having that <span style="color:red" data-ts="2438.995" data-end_ts="2439.285" title="2438.995" id=c_"2438.995">__kind__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2439.285" data-end_ts="2439.365" title="2439.285" id=c_"2439.285">__of__</span>, having that background and focus to, from a, from a young age as someone who focused on small details and sounds <span style="color:red" data-ts="2448.265" data-end_ts="2448.485" title="2448.265" id=c_"2448.265">__in__</span> particular because melodic, it's, slightly more pure tone of the violin and really focusing on the subtleties of Boeing to morph tams. I think that those are some of the formative elements of, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2461.785" data-end_ts="2462.005" title="2461.785" id=c_"2461.785">__my__</span> compositional style and what, what drives me. I think that feeling, you know, playing the violin, you feel close to the sound. You feel like you're inside the sound and all of the details of the sound are all around you and you're inside of it. And I think that a lot of my composition is, expanding that to, to new Tims <span style="color:red" data-ts="2486.005" data-end_ts="2486.165" title="2486.005" id=c_"2486.005">__and__</span> new ways of creating those, those feelings for and to share as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And what does that, what does that process look like? Do you, like, do, do you sit down and imagine melodic lines and write 'em down? Or do you improvise a bunch and capture it and look for, look for nuggets in that or, Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>Yeah. Well, I do actually usually start with, synthesizer. And that's, the basis for, and I then I start to usually within, long <span style="color:red" data-ts="2523.905" data-end_ts="2524.125" title="2523.905" id=c_"2523.905">__sym__</span> synthesizer, improvisations, I'll find melodic elements, rhythmic elements that I want to kind of bring out or, imagine happening. And I'll start to create those, with different instruments. Sure. And so I, it's, this album also started with some samples on of, the mills old Moog that they have, which is one of the early prototypes, like a three PI think is, it is. And I went in there one summer evening. I was, I was actually teaching there at the time, so I had access and I just recorded a whole bunch of different improvisations with it. A lot of those ended up being used on the album a couple years later because they were developed into these songs that came out of the Moog. I mean, you'll hear the mo all throughout the album if you, can, can recognize it. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But it is the backbone of, many of the songs on it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, that's, that's really interesting. So are you a person that like, kind of keeps the tape running all the time? Or do you explore and then try and remember bits and pieces that, that hit you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>Well, I, I think that I, I like to explore and then when I feel like I'm in a good spot, hit record, see what else happens with that. There are some, certainly some ideas that I have of that I'd like to explore, for example, where I was like, oh, well I really like the way that the violin and the synthesizer are interacting in this song. I'd like to see if I can recreate that with the flute and this other synthesizer on this other song. And so there are some more perhaps cerebrally driven, ideas of composition as well that happen. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. So what, other than the mills, three p, what, synthesizers do you primarily use? Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>I have a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2639.845" data-end_ts="2640.245" title="2639.845" id=c_"2639.845">__profit__</span> 600 at home, which is a very, very funny beast. <laugh>. Yeah. It was the first, I think it was the first synthesizer with midi, if I'm not mistaken. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yep. You're right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>It's very funky. <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>It has a lot of character and really I think nothing else sounds like it. As a sound designer, I like the fact that it has a very unique sound and if I'm looking for something that's going to, for example, cut through the mix or sound very different than everything else, it's, you can, you could promise you can reach for the P 600. It's not gonna sound like anything else. Right. Any software that you have, any, any hardware, other analog synthesizers? No. It's just it's own thing. And so I love it for that. I also have this, analog solutions stem synthesizer. Mm-Hmm. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2694.325" data-end_ts="2694.365" title="2694.325" id=c_"2694.325">__<affirmative>__</span>, which is a mono synth. I love it. I love the filter on it. I think it reminds me of the Moog and the way that the filter sings. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, that is definitely been a mainstay of my, a lot of my solo work for a long time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>I think Glass Canyon has a lot of, of that synthesizer on it as well. I also have a Dave Smith Instrument Pro two, which is a more recent acquisition. And I love that one because of its all of the possibilities and timbers that it's capable of. If you want something that's very noisy, sound designy, if you have an idea, pretty much I think you can create it on that synthesizer. It's so versatile. Sure. Interesting. If you want a pure sine wave tone, you can get that too. So it has a and a modulation matrix that you can create almost anything with. And so it's versatility is, is huge. And then I also was lucky enough to borrow, Chuck Johnson's modular synth to use on the album as well, for some other stuff. So, and also in Glass Canyon, I got to borrow a modular synth from my friend, coworker Thomas Day. So I've had the, the fortune of having, some friends with some, nice modular gear <laugh>, <laugh> since I, haven't, haven't invested in that direction on my own, but luckily I get to play around with it a lot. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, absolutely. That's cool. So you use a lot of acoustic instruments. You somehow, you ended up playing the flute even though you, you did this violin piano thing, but you never told me how you even got the flute <laugh>, but I think it's cool that you're doing flute, but you do these acoustic instruments. Do you ever, do you ever run the acoustic stuff through the synths or do those kinda live in a separate, in two different head spaces for you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>Hmm. That's a, that's a really good question. So I did actually start playing the flute. I'll just let you know, in, middle school bands <laugh> <laugh>. Okay. So in order to participate in my middle school music program, I needed to pick an instrument that wasn't the violin or piano. 'cause they didn't have an orchestra. Right. And, so I picked the flute, and then I got kicked out of band. So <laugh> then I didn't play the flute anymore until date, palms <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh my God. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>But, so instruments being, processed by synthesizers. So I, I explored some of that in, my earlier work, especially, I would be processing the violin through Max and Super Collider. I think that for me, some of the more, more interesting things that I was finding was perhaps not necessarily how the process was influencing both sounds at the same time, but how the two sounds are interacting in the acoustic space. So that's been a focus of mine for a while now. And so I think that my approach tends to be as, as a mixing engineer as well, knowing that I can create interactions between the sounds by how they're placed in acoustic space. Sure. It's interesting. It's one of those things that I, I explored quite a bit and then I was kind of like, okay. I think I wanna just do it this way, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, I hear you. I mean, if, if nothing else too, it seems like, you know, 'cause I, I'm a guitar player as well as doing a lot of work with synthesizers and software, obviously. I actually find that playing my guitar, especially an acoustic guitar through a synthesizer where there should be like the opportunity for lots of Tamil fun. I like lose the connection with the physicality of the instruments somehow. Hmm. I mean, I can still feel it, but somehow the vibrations that I feel against my chest no longer really match the vibrations I hear coming out of a speaker. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and the whole thing just becomes disconnected to me. Right. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And so for me, there's like <span style="color:red" data-ts="2938.165" data-end_ts="2938.285" title="2938.165" id=c_"2938.165">__a__</span>, it's, it, it, it doesn't, it doesn't work to try and do that, like multi-level piping, I guess. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>Yeah. I think that, I wonder if that's, that's part of, part of what I experienced. I think that when I first started playing the electric violin, I was just so excited by all the different tampers that I could <span style="color:red" data-ts="2956.485" data-end_ts="2956.805" title="2956.485" id=c_"2956.485">__finally__</span> lead to. Right, right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2958.555" data-end_ts="2958.845" title="2958.555" id=c_"2958.555">__When__</span> really bonkers with, you know, of course the first thing that I did beside, you know, just tweaking, building all sorts of crazy effects and like Max and super quieter was getting like a, I got this one, one guitar Pedald, which is, a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2974.285" data-end_ts="2974.405" title="2974.285" id=c_"2974.285">__w__</span> and Ring wa all in one. Oh 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Dear. Oh my goodness. Did they actually call it the train wreck? I hope so. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b><laugh>, it was, I can't remember what it was called. Like the snarling dog, I think. <laugh>. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Okay. Of course, of course. And you couldn't wait to take your pretty, your, your, all those years that your mom paid for violin lessons and you had to pump it through a snarling dog, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>Oh, yeah. Yeah. That was, I think was probably my first puddle. So yeah. <laugh> hilarious. I was like, we need to journey up this violin <laugh>. It's time enough with the pretty enough with the pretty, pretty, right.

<b>Darwin: </b>My, my final question here for you has to do with, with performance. You said that you're, you've been doing a little bit of touring lately, doing that kinda stuff, and, you've been, you've been touring with, with someone that plays bass, right? Is that right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Chuck Johnson. Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative>. All right. So what if somebody goes to one of your shows? What, what are they gonna experience? Is it going to, is it going to include the imagery? Is it in, do you do like songs off the album or do you do improvisational things? I used to be in a group where they called it improvisation, where it's like composed improvisation mixed, right. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. How do you, how do you approach taking the things you do and bringing it into a live environment? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>Since I started to work with visuals, everything got a little bit more complicated <laugh>. But, in general, my, my goal is an immersive audio visual experience of the album as this performance. And so, you'll see videos that are synchronized to the sounds that you're hearing and the synthesizers that are being played back. You'll also see me performing on flutes and voice and violin, as well as doing real-time mixing of songs and, jamming with Chuck Johnson on bass. And so there's elements of improvisation <laugh>, in my process. I think always there has been, since I've been performing my own music, I've always had elements of, of areas where, which are pretty fixed or have a more clear idea of what I wanna do and areas that allow the moment to kind of take its own shape with this particular material. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>I am playing songs off the album because of the, I am tied in the end to the length of certain synthesizer samples, which is just how, what I, a decision that I made that having synchronized visuals to the sound was very important to me. I think that that then, you know, creates a complexity with how much improvisation room you have in the, in the time domain. And so I've been working a lot, was creating different layers of videos that allow me to kind of move between sections in a more fluid way. And I'm still working on them. So <laugh>, I'm just working on a new video, this weekend and, you know, looking forward to, you know, taking what I've learned and taking that to the next round of shows that we'll be doing. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="3179.235" data-end_ts="3179.525" title="3179.235" id=c_"3179.235">__Yeah__</span>. That sounds great. Well, I look forward to being able to see, see you, do a live show. It's gotta be incredible, so, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>Oh, thank you so much, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright. And just as we wrap up here again, marielle jacobson's dot com is, where people can go to see, see and hear some of your work. Do you have a band camp type site or someplace where people can buy your stuff? Or do they just need to go to their local record store? What's, what's the best way for people to get access to your music? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>Oh, yeah. Well, the latest album as well as probably day poems, albums as well, can be found in, in the record stores and online at the Thrill Jockey website. And I do have my own web store on my website as well, so if you make your way to <span style="color:red" data-ts="3229.805" data-end_ts="3230.005" title="3229.805" id=c_"3229.805">__al__</span> jacobson.com, you can, there's a little store button there. And I do have a band camp as well, which is <span style="color:red" data-ts="3236.725" data-end_ts="3236.885" title="3236.725" id=c_"3236.725">__elle__</span> jacobson.bandcamp.com. So you, if you're into that and would prefer to just do a download, for example. And also there's some other nuggets of, some older stuff that you might not have heard of. And if you wanna check out, Darwin's Bitch, for example. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Which has nothing to, has, has nothing to do with me, I'm sure. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>No, I know you had to bring that in. Yeah, right. I'm glad you took the bait. <laugh> <laugh>. That's right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright. Fantastic. Thanks a lot for spending the time. We've blown through this, this hour and, in record time it seems. But thank you so much for spending time talking and exploring some of this history and, some of your vision for how to do art. It's really fascinating. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Marielle: </b>Oh, thanks, Darwin. It was a pleasure. 
</p>

<p>
