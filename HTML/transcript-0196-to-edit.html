<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today I have the great fortune of speaking to someone whose work I'm really into. His name's Alessio Tini, and he is the mastermind behind key devices, key devices. If you don't know 'em, you probably should, especially if you're in the Ableton Live world, you've run across their packs. They've done some really, really neat stuff. Some of my favorites are like the terra synth, the little holder device, which I'm just always fascinated with. But they've done a ton of stuff, and recently they branched out into more things. So let me stop talking. Let's talk to <span style="color:red" data-ts="46.645" data-end_ts="47.005" title="46.645" id=c_"46.645">__Lessio__</span>. Hey, man. How's it going? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alessio Santini (K-Devices): </b>Hey, it's great. Thanks. Thanks, Davin. Thanks for this proposition. I'm really happy to, to be in your podcast. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm very happy to have you on board. This is great. It was neat. Marsha <span style="color:red" data-ts="60.065" data-end_ts="60.285" title="60.065" id=c_"60.065">__Vin__</span>, the PR person, she calls herself a PR maven. She kind of, she suggested, 'cause I really am a big user of your gear, and so it's, neat to have the opportunity to talk with you. Oh, good. For people who aren't, <span style="color:red" data-ts="72.985" data-end_ts="73.205" title="72.985" id=c_"72.985">__you__</span> aren't that familiar yet with key devices, why don't you give us a quick rundown of the kinds of things that you do? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alessio: </b>Basically, we are a company that, design, max <span style="color:red" data-ts="82.885" data-end_ts="83.085" title="82.885" id=c_"82.885">__for__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="83.085" data-end_ts="83.245" title="83.085" id=c_"83.085">__life__</span> devices. So it started, with Max <span style="color:red" data-ts="86.005" data-end_ts="86.205" title="86.005" id=c_"86.005">__for__</span> live, and, now recently thanks to <span style="color:red" data-ts="90.385" data-end_ts="90.605" title="90.385" id=c_"90.385">__Jen__</span> Environment in Max, we are starting to release also other kind of products. Last June, we released our first iOS application, that, it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="101.325" data-end_ts="101.485" title="101.325" id=c_"101.325">__called__</span> Shaper. It's an <span style="color:red" data-ts="102.965" data-end_ts="103.365" title="102.965" id=c_"102.965">__effect__</span>, and it works, and standalone. And, as a audio unit extension in iOS. From here, we, we are working to release also audio unit effect for desktop platforms. So mainly is this software started with Max <span style="color:red" data-ts="118.805" data-end_ts="119.005" title="118.805" id=c_"118.805">__for__</span> live and now, <span style="color:red" data-ts="120.345" data-end_ts="120.565" title="120.345" id=c_"120.345">__or__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="120.565" data-end_ts="120.725" title="120.565" id=c_"120.565">__the__</span> platform tool 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Shaper is your first, iOS application. Yes. So how did you find that transition? I mean, <span style="color:red" data-ts="127.825" data-end_ts="128.045" title="127.825" id=c_"127.825">__in__</span>, in the case of doing Max for live devices, it's pretty easy to find where, or get the attention of people, right? Because Max, <span style="color:red" data-ts="136.285" data-end_ts="136.485" title="136.285" id=c_"136.285">__for__</span> live, <span style="color:red" data-ts="136.645" data-end_ts="136.845" title="136.645" id=c_"136.645">__it__</span> runs inside of Ableton Live. There are a few main places you can talk to live users. iOS to me seems like, I don't know, it seems like a circus. I don't even know how you get anybody's attention there. What has that been like? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alessio: </b>Yes, it's another <span style="color:red" data-ts="152.895" data-end_ts="153.245" title="152.895" id=c_"152.895">__world__</span>. Of course. It's another community. And, for us, the interest in developing for this platform, grow up slowly. Okay. Starting from, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="164.125" data-end_ts="164.285" title="164.125" id=c_"164.125">__features__</span> that, of <span style="color:red" data-ts="164.825" data-end_ts="165.045" title="164.825" id=c_"164.825">__Gen__</span> that let you export the code, this gave us, the first idea of, hey, maybe we can do something else too. Okay. We are happy with <span style="color:red" data-ts="174.965" data-end_ts="175.165" title="174.965" id=c_"174.965">__Max__</span>, with Max <span style="color:red" data-ts="175.805" data-end_ts="176.005" title="175.805" id=c_"175.805">__four__</span> Liva. I can talk about this later if you want, but, also reaching also other kind of users, was also, a challenge for us. So it was interesting. We, we already developed, this app shape, almost one year ago. Then we stopped the development when, the audio <span style="color:red" data-ts="198.645" data-end_ts="198.965" title="198.645" id=c_"198.645">__unique__</span> extension thing came up strongly. Okay. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So I think that this, bring to iOS, workflow that's more usable. Finally. Okay. I mean, already the <span style="color:red" data-ts="211.005" data-end_ts="211.445" title="211.005" id=c_"211.005">__interrupter__</span> audio standard it <span style="color:red" data-ts="213.405" data-end_ts="213.445" title="213.405" id=c_"213.405">__is__</span> cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alessio: </b>Okay. Because if you think before that, there was just a single working audio applications. Okay? So these bring to iOS, workflow idea if you want. Then this thing of the audio unit make the things more similar to how you, you do on your, on your desktop. Okay. Right. The main part of musicians today, I think play with, with desktop, or laptop computers. Okay? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So, this is something that I think slowly will take, more place in the composition, work for, for people. Okay. So it was an interesting place to be if you want. And, so we developed this app, that is the first of a series, just to see how we can interact with these kind of users. Okay. This is also why we decided to, we, we choose <span style="color:red" data-ts="267.525" data-end_ts="267.685" title="267.525" id=c_"267.525">__them__</span> to realize, let me see, <span style="color:red" data-ts="269.725" data-end_ts="269.845" title="269.725" id=c_"269.725">__a__</span> simple effect. Okay. It's not a revolutionary application. It's, let's say just an effect. This is because we want to introduce a brick in this workflow. And, we want to make a simple, if you want, but well, working brick, a simple thing that do, its job well that, slowly can take place in the wish list of the musicians of different kind of music. So this is, why we are on IUs. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, no, that's really interesting. And it's interesting that, that it was the audio units, implementation that caused you to make, that, make that leap. And, and I have to tell you, I think that you are actually smart to wait because I have had fits and starts over the years trying to enjoy working with audio on a, on an iOS device. And the reason it's been just, there were too many different ways you had to work. There wasn't a seamless workflow. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And so, as you suggest, that a lot of times made it very difficult to enjoy working with multiple applications. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alessio: </b>I agree. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So then you would have to find an application that had every function you ever wanted, and there's no such thing that exists. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alessio: </b>Yes. Yes. Yes. I have to say that as a, as a user, I have an iPad, but, since sometimes ago I was not really able to, to play music on iPad. Okay. Right. Because, I see that more like a really powerful, if you want gadget. But, something was missing, about, my needs as composer. Okay. Now I see a chance to, to create chains of <span style="color:red" data-ts="375.085" data-end_ts="375.365" title="375.085" id=c_"375.085">__effort__</span>, et cetera. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, this became possible to me too. This is also why without finally to come on, on iOS, because, we started to see ourself as possible. IO musicians, if you want. So, right. This is happening strongly with audio unit. Okay. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So I prefer also when I do some, I, I never really finished some composition on iPad, but it's now, it's became something where I can start to work on some, some idea to sketch something. And, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="410.805" data-end_ts="410.965" title="410.805" id=c_"410.805">__have__</span> to say that I prefer to work. This is also from, all my life. We also, with U <inaudible>, with Max, I prefer to work with a little, bricks that I can, chain and manipulate, as I want, as I can. I push as I want instead of really, super doing stuff software. Okay. Sure. Sure. So this is, my approach. This is why, shaper came up in this form. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that makes a lot of sense. Yeah. And it's kind of interesting too, to, to really think of, you know, I hadn't thought about it this way before, but really the way that this, the iOS audio units, and for that matter, even audio units on the desktop works, is components, just like max objects are components and just like live devices are components. And so, yes. Yeah. You, it's kind of seems like you've surrounded yourself with components. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alessio: </b>Yes. Yes. Absolutely. Yeah. It's, this is also the way I work, when I compose my, my own music, and this is the way I, I used to think about new products, okay. I want to be, our products, be a part of, solid workflow. Our goal is to improve, the experience that people have with an already well-known, workflow. Let's see, <span style="color:red" data-ts="490.805" data-end_ts="491.045" title="490.805" id=c_"490.805">__<inaudible>__</span> Live, we just talked about iOS, et cetera. We want to be an intriguing part of, of this, an intriguing part of this. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What kind of music do you make when you're making music? Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alessio: </b>Yes. This is a really complex question. <laugh>, if I talk too much, you, you, you stop me, please. So, it's interesting because, I come from a really, in the nineties, I'm old guy <laugh>. In the nineties, I played guitar in, <span style="color:red" data-ts="518.705" data-end_ts="518.925" title="518.705" id=c_"518.705">__in__</span> do metal bands. Okay. Do metal. It's was something that really, I don't know, inspired me for a lot of time. This absence of structure, this priority to the, the timber of the sound. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Mm-Hmm. It was something that really talked to me. Okay. So this is, something that, I, I always carried with me about, during my, life as student, as developer, when I met Max. And it was, I think, 2002, I was a student in Bologna in <span style="color:red" data-ts="549.565" data-end_ts="549.845" title="549.565" id=c_"549.565">__Italy__</span>. And, this <span style="color:red" data-ts="551.435" data-end_ts="551.725" title="551.435" id=c_"551.435">__open__</span>, of course, you know, this experience, I think this has changed everything for me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alessio: </b>Right? Okay. First, I'm not a geek. I am not an informatic, background as a student, okay? I studied, stuff of <inaudible>, Latin, et cetera. I was <span style="color:red" data-ts="568.965" data-end_ts="569.085" title="568.965" id=c_"568.965">__a__</span> really not the right type of <span style="color:red" data-ts="572.265" data-end_ts="572.485" title="572.265" id=c_"572.265">__do__</span> that to, to, to work with that. But, I interacted with the software, and really, I found a way to, to work with it and, to take, what I need in my way. Okay? Mm-Hmm, <affirmative>. So, this took me a lot of time, a lot of effort. I think that during, 2000, 2010, I do not make really music made, really music something that you, you finish. Okay. I, I never do that. I have, <span style="color:red" data-ts="601.005" data-end_ts="601.125" title="601.005" id=c_"601.005">__I__</span> drive full of experiment sound, that, I exported, the, actually with a <span style="color:red" data-ts="607.725" data-end_ts="607.845" title="607.725" id=c_"607.725">__f__</span> records object, but I was no longer able to compose something with a start and a finish. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alessio: </b>This is also, I think because, then in 2005, I moved to Paris, university <span style="color:red" data-ts="622.365" data-end_ts="622.565" title="622.365" id=c_"622.365">__<inaudible>__</span>, where I made, master in, science at Technology of arts, okay. With, a professor that really inspired me. His name is Orio. It's <span style="color:red" data-ts="634.285" data-end_ts="634.405" title="634.285" id=c_"634.285">__a__</span>, composer from Argentina. And it's, really a pioneer of the translation of sound, <span style="color:red" data-ts="640.045" data-end_ts="640.245" title="640.045" id=c_"640.045">__there__</span> and <span style="color:red" data-ts="640.665" data-end_ts="640.885" title="640.665" id=c_"640.665">__me__</span> articulation. This was also a big love for me to do what you can do with ation. It's, to take a matter and, to create other matter from that it's really concrete as work. And also, once this really gave me a lot of feelings to, to gran sound, to, to <span style="color:red" data-ts="659.885" data-end_ts="660.205" title="659.885" id=c_"659.885">__makes__</span> this kind of process. So, on one side, you spend a lot of time of a software that, give a lot of possibilities, but, it's also an <span style="color:red" data-ts="668.285" data-end_ts="668.565" title="668.285" id=c_"668.285">__ocean__</span>. Okay? So to find, where to go, it's different that when I, I don't know, 2000 when I opened <span style="color:red" data-ts="675.705" data-end_ts="675.925" title="675.705" id=c_"675.705">__the__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="676.485" data-end_ts="676.685" title="676.485" id=c_"676.485">__Kube__</span>, you put in some <span style="color:red" data-ts="678.085" data-end_ts="678.285" title="678.085" id=c_"678.085">__media__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alessio: </b>It's, it was another word, right? <span style="color:red" data-ts="681.165" data-end_ts="681.285" title="681.165" id=c_"681.165">__Exciting__</span>. But I was really lost, I think, as Muji, as musicians. I learned a lot as developer, but I was lost. I, I also to, to learn better, max, I think I also stopped <span style="color:red" data-ts="693.785" data-end_ts="694.005" title="693.785" id=c_"693.785">__at__</span> the time to create, an aesthetic thought about my music. So I was, I really <span style="color:red" data-ts="699.525" data-end_ts="699.925" title="699.525" id=c_"699.525">__dropped__</span> these things. And on the other side, it was also, I think because my two big, passions was to extremes. If you want be, because if you think to dom or <span style="color:red" data-ts="711.215" data-end_ts="711.565" title="711.215" id=c_"711.215">__drone__</span> as you, as you mm-Hmm. <affirmative> have today, you have an almost absence of articulation and, this slow time, if you want, right on the other side, <span style="color:red" data-ts="721.925" data-end_ts="722.085" title="721.925" id=c_"721.925">__ation__</span> sound. You have a lot of articulation, and the time <span style="color:red" data-ts="726.905" data-end_ts="727.125" title="726.905" id=c_"726.905">__go__</span> really fast, okay? You are in the millisecond domain. So I think that, it took to me a lot of time to merge this two <span style="color:red" data-ts="734.965" data-end_ts="735.165" title="734.965" id=c_"734.965">__world__</span>, because as musician, I am these two things. Okay? I cannot do one without the other one, because it, it'll be not me, no, no longer me. So I really had, I need a lot of time to, to create something that me, these two words, and that can represent me to myself, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alessio: </b>And, to, to answer. Finally, to your question, I came today to create some music that use both these two elements. Okay? So I, I use a lot of guitars, so really massive and harsh, distortions. And, I also use, in different, way sometimes it's like, to the percussive pulion, poses. And, I use granulation of <span style="color:red" data-ts="785.985" data-end_ts="786.205" title="785.985" id=c_"785.985">__mic__</span> articulation techniques. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So, by the way, my, my first release <span style="color:red" data-ts="791.665" data-end_ts="791.885" title="791.665" id=c_"791.665">__in__</span> a lot of time will be this next, November. It's an <span style="color:red" data-ts="797.365" data-end_ts="797.525" title="797.365" id=c_"797.365">__<inaudible>__</span>, cd Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, four <span style="color:red" data-ts="799.765" data-end_ts="800.045" title="799.765" id=c_"799.765">__trucks__</span>. And, this really important for me, because it's, an important, chapter. Really, it's an arrival for me. I, I am somewhere now, okay. I was floating <laugh> during all these years as composer. Now I am somewhere, I am someone, I have a proposition, for me and, for the other two. And so that's it. Really not ambient, because there is a lot of articulation, but, the articulation of sound and the guitar, it's always the source of, of any sound I use. And you're on the other side, you have this, guitar where, the most important part is the search, the quest for, for a sound. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's very interesting, and I think it's, I think it's cool that you actually are able to talk about it, not, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alessio: </b>Sorry, add a little problem. Can you repeat, please? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, yeah, sure. Can you hear me okay? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alessio: </b>Yes, it's fine. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright. I think it's very interesting that, that you're willing to discuss the fact that it's not easy to come up with your own voice. Right? Sometimes people make it seem like, well, you know, I was kind of like, I went for a walk and I came back and I had this new artistic vision, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alessio: </b>Yeah. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure, sure. I wish it was that easy, right? I, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alessio: </b>I do not know if, this should be for everyone, but for me, to compose, it's really hard. Yeah. Maybe that depends on me, on what I, I want from me. But, it's really a hard process. It's really tiring if you want to. Sure. And, honestly, I, I like, it's like that, I like the, that music. It's really an <span style="color:red" data-ts="905.965" data-end_ts="906.165" title="905.965" id=c_"905.965">__act__</span> of, position of, of life if you want. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So it costs life. It's ask for energies, right? And, to find who you are. And, as I say, when, when you listen your music, to have the, the feeling to look in a mirror, <span style="color:red" data-ts="921.925" data-end_ts="922.045" title="921.925" id=c_"921.925">__I__</span>, it's hard. For me. It was impossible during this <span style="color:red" data-ts="925.005" data-end_ts="925.245" title="925.005" id=c_"925.005">__then__</span> years. Now it's possible. And, I dunno, maybe my music is no good. I don't know. <span style="color:red" data-ts="930.125" data-end_ts="930.245" title="930.125" id=c_"930.125">__But__</span> <laugh>, I, I'm happy because I found what I should be in music, I think. Right? This is, as human being, doing music, it's really a gift. I, I feel really lucky now in this days. 
</p>

<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that's, that sounds really exciting. And I think that, I think it's really interesting, too, to imagine what process you must have gone through being kind of into Doom Metal, and then all of a sudden encountering Max and computer music and this kind of generative work. I, I would think that the ears that you developed for Doom Metal didn't help you understand computer music very well. Would that be true? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alessio: </b>I, I have to say that when I met Max, I totally, I, I don't say that, before I, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="983.045" data-end_ts="983.245" title="983.045" id=c_"983.045">__drop__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="983.245" data-end_ts="983.405" title="983.245" id=c_"983.245">__it__</span> totally the guitar for, <span style="color:red" data-ts="984.665" data-end_ts="984.885" title="984.665" id=c_"984.665">__for__</span> years. Oh, wow. So, one replaced the other one for, for a while. Then I started to take again, the guitar. And today, this long pose make made of me a really strange guitarist, I think because I forgot a lot of things. I use re I really use guitar as a, as a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1006.675" data-end_ts="1006.965" title="1006.675" id=c_"1006.675">__time__</span> timber generator. Okay. Uhhuh, <affirmative>, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1008.925" data-end_ts="1009.045" title="1008.925" id=c_"1008.925">__need__</span>, I, I don't, do not play notes.

And then, yes, of course, max opened this, when I took, again, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1018.785" data-end_ts="1019.005" title="1018.785" id=c_"1018.785">__the__</span>, took back the guitar in my hand. I was pretty good in Max. And, and they, this let me see guitar, the possibilities of the guitar. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> in a totally another, in another way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alessio: </b>So that's it. I think my, my, my part was, was that Max replaced my previous, life is true. That's interesting. It really, it was really first years that, that I was in Paris. I spent a lot of time. But I think, all the guys that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1053.025" data-end_ts="1053.245" title="1053.025" id=c_"1053.025">__the__</span>, the play marks, departure really intensively, know that, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1059.005" data-end_ts="1059.125" title="1059.005" id=c_"1059.005">__I__</span> really, passed a lot of time with, with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1062.765" data-end_ts="1062.925" title="1062.765" id=c_"1062.765">__the__</span> software. It's really changed me, I think. But, interesting. I don't want to be too romantic. But, also as person changed with me, I don't know, it was, I, I have a really deep relationship with Max today. Yes. Also, because, if I know, this work, this job that I have with Max for, with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1082.245" data-end_ts="1082.365" title="1082.245" id=c_"1082.245">__K__</span> devices, I'm really happy with it. I live in a really rural environment now for my choice. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alessio: </b>And I live <span style="color:red" data-ts="1088.905" data-end_ts="1089.125" title="1088.905" id=c_"1088.905">__in__</span> top <span style="color:red" data-ts="1089.605" data-end_ts="1089.805" title="1089.605" id=c_"1089.605">__on__</span> mountains here in between France and Italy. And, when I came here, I knew that, there was no job in domain music for me. Okay? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> live in Paris. I quit this kind of job that I, that I loved, okay. Was I, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1106.305" data-end_ts="1106.525" title="1106.305" id=c_"1106.305">__do__</span> research from a interesting project staff for theaters, et cetera. But, at one time, the city was good, but I wanted to change. Okay? I came here in 2009, I think, and there was no music job in the around. And, and Max for <span style="color:red" data-ts="1126.205" data-end_ts="1126.445" title="1126.205" id=c_"1126.205">__Life__</span> came out. And, I said, okay, let's try to do something. If there a possibility to create a market, if you want, if there is a change. And, it worked, you know? So also, max saved my life from this point of view because, if not, I, I had to, to change, what the, the, the place where I live, or I had to, to accept a job that, is not <span style="color:red" data-ts="1151.165" data-end_ts="1151.365" title="1151.165" id=c_"1151.165">__to__</span> what I love. So, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, you and I share that in common because Max has allowed me to live where I want. I, I used to live up on the top of a mountain. Now I live next to 10,000 Lakes. So it's pretty amazing that, that Max lets us do that. Yes. So, I, I'm curious though, then, one of the things that I experienced when I was living kind of in a rural place is that I got a lot of joy outta using Max, but I also felt like it was difficult to stay connected with musical trends and musical interests and all that stuff. I mean, the internet makes it somewhat available, but there's nothing like being around people, you know? Yes. You travel around in order to sort of engage with the community, or are you kind of hiding out in the mountains right now? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alessio: </b>So, I want to be honest, I love to live here. Thanks. Also, because, when I came to live here, technology says the internet, let me, let me take a look around, okay? Right. But I love to live here. I go out, I develop my stuff, then I can go out, take my dog and go in the wood. This is really something that, healed me and inspire me. And on the other side, of course, there is a price. There is a price. It's that, okay, there is internet. I can listen to music, I can see what happens out there, but, it's not like to be there. Okay. So, yes, I travel, but, not so much, to say on the other side. I have also to say that I'm a quite misanthropic guy. So I, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1250.465" data-end_ts="1250.685" title="1250.465" id=c_"1250.465">__on__</span> the, the, the good part <span style="color:red" data-ts="1251.985" data-end_ts="1252.205" title="1251.985" id=c_"1251.985">__is__</span> I do not need, you know, there's people that, really need to be among the others. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alessio: </b>Okay. I, I'm really independent, from this point of view. Okay. But of course, of course there is a price. Sometimes <span style="color:red" data-ts="1264.805" data-end_ts="1264.925" title="1264.805" id=c_"1264.805">__I__</span>, I would like to travel more. Okay. I do some, some women <span style="color:red" data-ts="1269.465" data-end_ts="1269.685" title="1269.465" id=c_"1269.465">__to__</span> see some concert. I'm not, far from, Italian city.

So, <laugh>, it's, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1292.605" data-end_ts="1292.725" title="1292.605" id=c_"1292.605">__I__</span>, I'm happy in this, this is the right formula for me.

Okay. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I spent a lot of, I passed a lot of my life in, in cities.

</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. So, I wanna talk to you a little bit about the devices that, that you've made for Max for <span style="color:red" data-ts="1328.645" data-end_ts="1328.885" title="1328.645" id=c_"1328.645">__live__</span>, because I find 'em really interesting. But one of the things that I'm curious about is, what kind of team do you have behind K devices? You know, I know that, that you are, you are sort of the mastermind behind it. Do you have other developers or sound designers that you work with? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alessio: </b>Yeah, sure. Mainly, especially on the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1351.045" data-end_ts="1351.285" title="1351.045" id=c_"1351.045">__last__</span> product, I work alone, but, I collaborate with external person to, to realize, some projects. So, for example, a very important person for <span style="color:red" data-ts="1365.045" data-end_ts="1365.245" title="1365.045" id=c_"1365.045">__key__</span> devices today, also, also today, it's, Simon Fabry. Simon Fabry is the guy that own the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1371.805" data-end_ts="1372.045" title="1371.805" id=c_"1371.805">__<inaudible>__</span> brand, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1372.985" data-end_ts="1373.205" title="1372.985" id=c_"1372.985">__FTU__</span>. And, we started together. When we started, I was doing, the DSP, he started to work with me for the user interfaces. Then with time, we changed, our contributions. There's a lot of products <span style="color:red" data-ts="1389.005" data-end_ts="1389.285" title="1389.005" id=c_"1389.005">__where__</span> it's, deeply involved. It's an important part of the company, as I maybe already <span style="color:red" data-ts="1395.595" data-end_ts="1395.885" title="1395.595" id=c_"1395.595">__said__</span>, for, for iOS application, for example, we, we, I say we, because Simone, it's involved in this project, of the app, iOS application at Shaper and, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1407.325" data-end_ts="1407.605" title="1407.325" id=c_"1407.325">__through__</span> app to come. We work with, an external guide that, do the code for us. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alessio: </b>We, we export the DSP with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1416.225" data-end_ts="1416.445" title="1416.225" id=c_"1416.225">__gen__</span>, we export the code, of the user interface with other software. And, this guy make, merge, merge these two parts, and, help us with the Apple, specifically Apple developer domain. Mm-hmm, <affirmative>, right? Also, because, as I said, this is maybe not good to say, but, since I am lazy, I'm happy with, what I do, for example, for, to be in the Apple store and, to really well exploit, this domain. I prefer to, to refer to a person that I trust that, can do this work for me instead to start, I, I love learn new things, but, not in this kind. I think I am not too good in, I'm not a good coder, if you want. So I know my limits. And, if I have an idea, let's say a design and a concept, I want to realize it. I see where I am dependent, where I need someone that, can handle in the right way for me instead to, to <span style="color:red" data-ts="1477.645" data-end_ts="1477.885" title="1477.645" id=c_"1477.645">__mess__</span>. We think that, where I'm not too strong, if you want, as I said, really this is true. I'm not an informatic guy. So I have a mentality, the shape of my mind. It's not so flexible on the, all the, software tools or environments. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, yeah, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1497.305" data-end_ts="1497.525" title="1497.305" id=c_"1497.305">__no__</span>, my limits <span style="color:red" data-ts="1498.025" data-end_ts="1498.245" title="1498.025" id=c_"1498.025">__the__</span>, the other side of it. I recently in a different area, I did a, I did an interview with somebody, and they were talking about how if you feel like you have to do everything, then you have an infinite number of things to do, and so you won't do anything. Well, <laugh>, you know? Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alessio: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1514.865" data-end_ts="1515.085" title="1514.865" id=c_"1514.865">__And__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I think that it's interesting that, that you are willing to say, there are things that other people know better than me, and I'm gonna let them do that. I'm curious though. So, in working with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1529.135" data-end_ts="1529.485" title="1529.135" id=c_"1529.135">__Frick__</span>, did, how do you influence each other? Because the work that he does in those <span style="color:red" data-ts="1533.965" data-end_ts="1534.525" title="1533.965" id=c_"1533.965">__eurorack__</span> tools is some pretty amazing and kind of bizarre stuff. And I would say the kind of devices you make are kind of a little insane and, and bizarre <laugh>. And so it seems like you guys must, must influence each other. How does, how does it work to, between you in terms of driving each other forward? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alessio: </b>Okay. This is a fun, a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1558.285" data-end_ts="1558.445" title="1558.285" id=c_"1558.285">__fun__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1558.445" data-end_ts="1558.685" title="1558.445" id=c_"1558.445">__story__</span>. Yes. There is really a, really, a deep influence, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1562.565" data-end_ts="1562.685" title="1562.565" id=c_"1562.565">__a__</span> mutual influence. Okay. So if you want, Simon have, a vision of things that it's maybe better shaped. Okay. And me, on my side, I'm a little bit chaotic if you want, I, I like this. I like this. I like that this, part of Simon. So usually one of us came with an idea. We developed the idea when the idea it's working. We start with the user interface, and, we do <span style="color:red" data-ts="1592.625" data-end_ts="1592.845" title="1592.625" id=c_"1592.625">__all__</span> together. Okay? There's some tasks that he does, some tasks that I do, Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, but all the time we talk together to have a feedback from the other, when we go almost finish the product, and we have to choice, for example, use interface <span style="color:red" data-ts="1610.125" data-end_ts="1610.325" title="1610.125" id=c_"1610.125">__of__</span> function, IAD function, latest function, et cetera. This is a real, real two words, two, two different way to see words. We are different kind of users. There is a, the fight, okay, there's a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1623.565" data-end_ts="1623.845" title="1623.565" id=c_"1623.565">__reader__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Disagreement. Yeah.

<p>
<b>Alessio: </b>Yes. It's really, it's really, we know each other.

So there is a lot of diplomacy, a lot of, fight. Finally the product. It's, perfectly the shape of a synthesis of both of us on this kind of tool, okay. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1647.265" data-end_ts="1647.485" title="1647.265" id=c_"1647.265">__For__</span> synthesizer, for an effect, et cetera.

And, it's clear, it's an interaction that, it's, pointed to a synthesis. So this process involve, fight and diplomacy as we <laugh>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1689.205" data-end_ts="1689.405" title="1689.205" id=c_"1689.205">__we__</span> say all the time. <laugh>, it's fun.

It makes me then wonder, when I look at some of your devices, who, who was influencing what, right? <laugh>. 'cause like, to me, I found Tara a very interesting, polys synth because it's sort of like embraced some weird, chaotic behaviors. And ring modulation is a real big part of that synth and all this kind of stuff. It's, it's the kind of approach you don't normally see on a synthesizer. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. I'm curious about, you know, the decision making process and how, you know, is that an example of something that encapsulates the way that you like, think, think about music? I'm always curious with, with people who design instruments, how much of the instrument informs us about how they think of music?

But, when the idea came, to our first state of life, it start, producing sound of, processing sound. If it's an effect, it, start to talk to you. Okay.

Maybe with products, you know what you want at the end. So because it's for other people. So it's, there is, if you want, some <span style="color:red" data-ts="1887.765" data-end_ts="1888.005" title="1887.765" id=c_"1887.765">__class__</span> of effects, you are doing a delay, you are doing a spectral <span style="color:red" data-ts="1891.405" data-end_ts="1891.685" title="1891.405" id=c_"1891.405">__feature__</span>, you're doing a synthesizer. So there is a class that's a target. Okay. But, in our experience, when I work alone, or when I work with Simone, a product never finished <span style="color:red" data-ts="1903.225" data-end_ts="1903.445" title="1903.225" id=c_"1903.225">__the__</span>, as a, it was considered at the start. <laugh> never <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's, that's a real interesting point. But it also then makes me wonder, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1912.385" data-end_ts="1912.605" title="1912.385" id=c_"1912.385">__do__</span>, how much do you change in the process of making the instrument? So if you start off with ideas, ideas, and then it kind of morphs and switches with time. I mean it, when you look at an end product, like something like Terra, how far away from it is from what you started off with? 'cause you must have started off with an idea either with like these morphing waveforms or just the ki the way you were doing cross modulation or something. There was some nugget that you started with. When you get to the end, how different is it from where you started? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alessio: </b>Oh, well, it's really different because, te took development of, more than one year, I think a year and a half when we started it was because we wanted to create our proper synthesizer to bring our vision in this kind of, music part synthesis. And, when we started, look, I want to be honest, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1973.815" data-end_ts="1974.165" title="1973.815" id=c_"1973.815">__Terra__</span>, took this name. It's initial code name was <span style="color:red" data-ts="1977.525" data-end_ts="1977.805" title="1977.525" id=c_"1977.525">__Terra__</span>, because <span style="color:red" data-ts="1978.595" data-end_ts="1978.885" title="1978.595" id=c_"1978.595">__then__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1978.885" data-end_ts="1979.205" title="1978.885" id=c_"1978.885">__again__</span>, was, wave terrains. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, then, we started with Wave Terrains. And, we created the structure, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1989.085" data-end_ts="1989.445" title="1989.085" id=c_"1989.085">__effects__</span>, some effects, where there was, initial part of modulators not so complex. And, we decided together, Simone and I, that, it was better to, to create another kind of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2001.805" data-end_ts="2002.005" title="2001.805" id=c_"2001.805">__end__</span> game. This changed the other things in the chain. And, it bring to us, other kind of, theaters that, we can include in <span style="color:red" data-ts="2012.245" data-end_ts="2012.445" title="2012.245" id=c_"2012.245">__Terra__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alessio: </b>So I have to say that Terra, there is really a lot of work beyond the, beyond this, this device, because, it's something that this is really the case. It's something that <span style="color:red" data-ts="2024.755" data-end_ts="2025.045" title="2024.755" id=c_"2024.755">__talk__</span> to us, suggesting, other ways to do things. At the end, what we wanted was a synthesizer, a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2032.325" data-end_ts="2032.525" title="2032.325" id=c_"2032.325">__rich__</span> synthesizer that, let you versatile if you want, right? And if you listen to the preset, I have to say that, in, in my opinion, the goal, it's here. It's really versatile. And, it was also really another interesting thing. We asked to some sound designer to create, this, presets. And, also, if <span style="color:red" data-ts="2053.735" data-end_ts="2054.085" title="2053.735" id=c_"2053.735">__Simon__</span> and I work a lot about, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2056.035" data-end_ts="2056.325" title="2056.035" id=c_"2056.035">__this__</span> synthesizer, really a gift. It's when other people come to you with your instrument and make sound from your instrument that you created, that you, you say, wow, how you do that, with syn, you know, the power of the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2073.005" data-end_ts="2073.205" title="2073.005" id=c_"2073.005">__syn__</span>, but you are another kind of user. When the people, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2076.585" data-end_ts="2076.805" title="2076.585" id=c_"2076.585">__the__</span> sound designer, really, really good guys, came with this, this, these presets, it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2083.805" data-end_ts="2083.965" title="2083.805" id=c_"2083.805">__un__</span> epi for developer. Let's see. Wow. My instrument can do all of this. And you, you are just one person. You, you designed it, but you cannot have or simulate all the needs, all the different kind of aspiration that other people can have, right? So what's really interesting, yes, yes, yes. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I, I wonder though then, too, one of the potential problems <span style="color:red" data-ts="2107.345" data-end_ts="2107.565" title="2107.345" id=c_"2107.345">__is__</span> a designer, and because I know this happens to me all the time, is mm-Hmm, <affirmative>, I start working on something and I add more features, which means more controls. And the next thing is I have, I have something that only I can make sense of it. No one else can understand it, right? <laugh>, Mm-Hmm, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2126.765" data-end_ts="2126.885" title="2126.765" id=c_"2126.765">__sure__</span>. 'cause there are too many parameters, or there's too many labels, or not enough labels or the, the things that should be knobs or sliders or whatever. For whatever reason, people can't get over the hump of learning it. How do you approach it? Do you worry about that part of it? Or do you of course, want to expose as much information as possible? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alessio: </b>This is really important to us, and this is changed in time. Okay? When we started, we had, less experience on that. But what we do, usually it's to create the, the device with the features that, we like on it. What happens next? It's, we try to rationalize the, the instrument. Okay? So we ask two other people to use it. And usually, if you, if you look, our devices, there is a significant number of, of parameters, okay? So we delete, some stuff when, it's too much. But, usually, we, we try to create a user interface that, can be deep and rich, but, it's, logic. I don't want to, I cannot say easy, but logic to, to understand, okay, you start from apart. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2205.385" data-end_ts="2205.605" title="2205.385" id=c_"2205.385">__For__</span>, for example, terra, you have the ator, you have the, the s <span style="color:red" data-ts="2209.285" data-end_ts="2209.445" title="2209.285" id=c_"2209.285">__air__</span>, you have the, the effect, you have the modulator. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alessio: </b>So in one way, we can say that it's easy to understand, but it's still complex, right? So what we try to do is to give the user the choice. Okay? We include <span style="color:red" data-ts="2224.605" data-end_ts="2224.845" title="2224.605" id=c_"2224.605">__those__</span>, a lot of parameters, but our effort, it's to try to, to make it logic to read, okay, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2231.805" data-end_ts="2232.005" title="2231.805" id=c_"2231.805">__user__</span> interface. And for example, now I'm working on a new series of devices that I will release <span style="color:red" data-ts="2238.565" data-end_ts="2238.685" title="2238.565" id=c_"2238.565">__a__</span>, later this month. This is, it's another history. And I tried to create something more symbolic, okay? The interfaces, it's totally different from what we did until today. And, there's no words in the user interface. So there is not label to say this is <span style="color:red" data-ts="2259.365" data-end_ts="2259.485" title="2259.365" id=c_"2259.365">__the__</span> volume, this is, mm-Hmm, <affirmative>. But, I made, I, I tried, made a self-explanatory, user interface. So when you touch, parameter, and of course we are in live, so you are also live info view on, on the left. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alessio: </b>Mm-Hmm, <affirmative>, there is a description. Mm-Hmm, <affirmative>. But, when you touch the device, when you touch the parameter, there is an animation, okay, animation, of course, theologically integrated in the, in the user interface that make you understand what you're doing. And, this was <span style="color:red" data-ts="2293.125" data-end_ts="2293.245" title="2293.125" id=c_"2293.125">__a__</span> sort of challenge for me. And, when I started to do it, on one side, I think that, they are really beautiful, this interface. So I, I said, okay, this is good to see it. It's beautiful. I, I want it and, keep it work in this way. And, I think finally I found a good synthesis because they are exotic, a little bit exotic. If you want, you see this, say, what's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2321.845" data-end_ts="2322.045" title="2321.845" id=c_"2321.845">__that__</span>? But, after one minute, you, you understand how it works, what it does, each part of the user interface. It was an experiment, but, I think, I really enjoyed, and, I hope people too, I'll see in a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2336.445" data-end_ts="2336.645" title="2336.445" id=c_"2336.445">__moment__</span>. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Very interesting. Well, Alessio, we're, we're getting close to the end of our time, but before I let you go, I, I'm curious, you talk about having a big folder on your hard drive filled with experiments from your years of working with Max. Yes. I'm wondering, what are the kinds of things that you have kind of in your laboratory that, have yet to come out 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alessio: </b>For me? I'm working on, well, I recently get in touch with the company, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2370.235" data-end_ts="2370.525" title="2370.235" id=c_"2370.235">__more__</span> devices. Mm-Hmm.

And so on one side, I'm working on that other side, I'm working with <span style="color:red" data-ts="2395.605" data-end_ts="2395.805" title="2395.605" id=c_"2395.605">__my__</span> devices. I'm in touch with them also because there is a, I'm developing something for, for them. So also, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2403.085" data-end_ts="2403.205" title="2403.085" id=c_"2403.085">__K__</span> devices, these are to your question, as future instrument will have this series of devices that I just, talked about. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, I hope some, more compatible, effects new iOS application. And I think the next step, will be to, to bring, a version of Holder. It's a spectral freezer, on io on. Oh, nice. This is, I, I like Holder. It's one of my favorite devices, you know, 
</p>

<p>

It's really been great. I'm glad to hear that you're going to find a way to get some of this stuff on hardware. I'm a big fan of having stuff run on hardware too, and I'm a big fan of on Devices, so that's a, that's a match made in heaven for me as well. But I want to thank you for spending the time talking and giving us some insight on how you, how you design and how you think about this stuff. It's really interesting. Interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alessio: </b>My pleasure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And many thanks to Lessio for having the chat, man, guys, doing some neat work. If you haven't tried the key devices stuff, you really need to get yourself out there and give <span style="color:red" data-ts="2505.685" data-end_ts="2505.805" title="2505.685" id=c_"2505.685">__it__</span> a try. Currently, unless you're an iOS person, which I'm not, so I can't help you out with much with, but most their action is happening, in Ableton Live <span style="color:red" data-ts="2516.045" data-end_ts="2516.245" title="2516.045" id=c_"2516.045">__is__</span> matched for live devices, go ahead and check 'em out. It's worth the effort, again, much like <span style="color:red" data-ts="2522.125" data-end_ts="2522.405" title="2522.125" id=c_"2522.125">__Bless__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2522.475" data-end_ts="2522.965" title="2522.475" id=c_"2522.475">__himself__</span>, I use Holder and practically every live set that I work on. So there's that. I want to thank you, the listeners for sticking with me, keeping cranking these out. If you have any questions or comments, let me know. I also want to thank everybody that helped out on the Facebook, feed. I put out a call for help to find some interviewees, and I got some great options. In fact, I have, by the end of next week, I'll have like 10 of 'em in Hopper, which is great because I have a lot of travel in November and December. So I needed your help. Thank you so much for that. Stay tuned for some amazing, amazing discussions over the next few weeks, next couple months. Thanks a lot, and we'll catch you around next time.
