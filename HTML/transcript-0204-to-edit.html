<b>Darwin: </b>Hey, welcome to another Midweek Art, music and Technology podcast. Got something a little different. First of all, I'm doing the double ups again this week, but it's for specific reason. This week we are kicking off a Kickstarter campaign for the podcast. Basically, we wanna up our game on the recording side. So we're going to pick up a sure sm seven microphone nice boom arm, a nice preamp. The preamp is gonna depend on how much we get <span style="color:red" data-ts="39.365" data-end_ts="39.525" title="39.365" id=c_"39.365">__outta__</span> the Kickstarter, but I need your help. So if you could, either go to the show notes and follow the Kickstarter link, or if you just go over to kickstarter.com and do a search, for art music technology, you'll find that our Kickstarter is labeled Mic preUpdate for Art Plus Music Plus Technology. That's our thing. I really could use your help to get this thing going. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And, it only runs until the 11th of December, so please, help me out by cranking on it. And, again, if I, hit the mark, that's great. If I go over, I'm going to be putting up a stretch goal that'll offer basically doubled up podcasts throughout the month of December. So, if you're into it, if you like the idea of hearing my voice twice a week, shoot for the moon. If you don't want to hear me twice a week, well still, help out if you can. With that, I, introduce you to Dave Small of Catalyst Audio. Catch you later.
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today I have the great pleasure of getting to talk to somebody new to me. He's been, he was kind of pointed out to me by my friend, Clifton, who ha always seems, seems to point out, interesting people for me to talk to. So, thanks Clifton for opening yet another door. Today we're talking to a guy named Dave <span style="color:red" data-ts="134.775" data-end_ts="135.125" title="134.775" id=c_"134.775">__Small__</span>. He is the mastermind behind Catalyst Audio, one of the newest, Eurorack manufacturers, but somebody who's got some ideas that I am pretty keen on. The first module is called Times Arrow, and it's sort of like the kind of sequencing module I find myself making all the time, whether it's, trying to do it with the hardcore module, or if I'm trying to do it using, the mono tele teletype or whatever. I always seem to try and make these things. And here we go. Dave's made one, for me. You know, I'm salivating for it already, but he's also got some interesting future ideas and we'll talk to him about it. So with, with that, let's say hello to Dave. Hey Dave. How's it going? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave Small (Catalyst Audio): </b>I'm doing good. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright. Hey, thanks so much for taking the time to, to chat. I really do appreciate it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Of course. Always enjoy talking about synthesizers and electronic music. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Me too. <laugh>, why don't we start off by having you talk a little bit about Catalyst Audio and what <span style="color:red" data-ts="200.385" data-end_ts="200.605" title="200.385" id=c_"200.385">__you__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="200.605" data-end_ts="200.725" title="200.605" id=c_"200.605">__are__</span>, what you are doing, what your work is. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Okay. So Catalyst Audio is obviously a Euro rack, focused modular sync company. What I've currently been doing, well, it started with Time Zero. That was, our first module that came out about a year ago, probably at this point. And since that time I've been working on doing, a set of recreations of some of the very original, modular synthesis modules from the, the late sixties. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The, the things that you're working on, is it like an attempt to make a full voice or is it, like specific kind of, kind of tooling? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Yeah, it's actually, well, it's based off of the original Bulo 100 series. Okay. So it's basically trying to essentially recreate that system in a eurorack format currently, and this is actually set to come out probably in the next couple of weeks or so. The first five modules will be an oscillator, a envelope generator, a mixer, a control voltage processor, and a, a gate. Oh, okay. Or essentially a VCA. So it should work as a, a full voice within that format. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. But these are gonna be Eurorack Eurorack devices? Yes. Nice. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="295.745" data-end_ts="296.035" title="295.745" id=c_"295.745">__Yeah__</span>, these will be all eurorack. They are essentially, the same circuits as the original 100 series, but these will be available for Euro Rack. And about the only thing that's been changed is that the input and output voltages have been scaled so that they work with Euro Rack and not the original zero to 15 volts for control voltages and one volt peak to <span style="color:red" data-ts="325.155" data-end_ts="325.315" title="325.155" id=c_"325.155">__peak__</span> for the audio. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>But other than that, they're pretty much all based just around the original circuits. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So how did you get fascinated with, with the booklet stuff? I mean, you have, did you have a chance to work with this in the past? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>It's mostly just from watching millions and millions of YouTube videos. <laugh>, it kind of got me fascinated in an easel Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and I put together one of the easel clones and was just blown away with how it sounded. And, I've been, I've been interested in, you know, synthesizers and music for a long time, and at this point it's pretty rare that something comes along that just really is unique in an amazing way. And that was, you know, anytime something is, is particularly unique and fascinating, I have to try and figure out why. And so that leads to me looking more and more at the circuits and trying to sort of quantify where the magic is. That just sort of got me fascinated with sort of where the roots of that came from. So that was pretty much, how that started. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. That seems like swinging for the fences, right? Literally coming, starting, you know, you, you've done one module and now all of a sudden you're gonna, <span style="color:red" data-ts="407.575" data-end_ts="407.865" title="407.575" id=c_"407.575">__your__</span> next thing is gonna be like a, a series of five modules. I don't know, does it feel risky to you or does it feel like it's just, part of the fun and and how much are you needing this to be a business? Or is it just, something you're doing as sort of like a, a Schreiber? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, he, he calls, he calls for a long time, his modular or job, he called it his Joby because it was sort of like a job, but it was, you know, it was meant to be more of a hobby. Where does modular building come in for you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>I am hoping that it, it eventually becomes, closer to the job than the hobby 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Got it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b><laugh>, I am fortunate enough to have a very awesome and understanding wife who we planned out a, a timetable with. And she said, you know, if this was something that you really want to do, let's see if we can make it work and we'll, we'll reevaluate things at three month intervals or so and see, see whether we both continue to think that it's a, a worthwhile investment. That's, that's basically where it is. I'm, I'm hoping it works out to be more on the job side, but, you know, it's, it's a tough business to get into. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, right. It is. Well, although luckily it seems to be like one of the real growth areas in the whole musical instrument thing, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Yes, absolutely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So what is your background in terms of, of design and, <span style="color:red" data-ts="500.065" data-end_ts="500.285" title="500.065" id=c_"500.065">__and__</span> electronics that gives you the comfort level to take this on or even to have created the Times Arrow in the first place? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>That's actually an interesting question because my background, I, I don't actually have any formal training in electronics. This is something that probably 15 or 20 years ago I could have absolutely never done. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. My background is actually in economics, so, which is, you know, totally unrelated <laugh>. Right. I mean, I, I should go further back. I, I do have a, a background in music. I've been playing music, been in bands, writing music for probably the past 20 or 25 years of my life. I ran a recording studio for a while and I have, you know, a degree in recording technology that, that, you know, one of the, one of the degrees that doesn't really count for anything <laugh>. But, so I've been doing that for a while. And one of the things that I always did with music was that I was always kind of fascinated with the intersection of music and technology. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So I've been involved in that even when I was first getting started way back in the probably early nineties. I, I would guess, I think my family, my father is actually an optical engineer, and my mother is a, professional pianist. So between the two of them, we were one of the first families that actually had a, a sequencer connected to their computer. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I was gonna say that sounds, that sounds like the perfect pieces for like life as a budding lec electronic musician slash technologist to have, the combination of engineer engineering pianist for a family. That's, that's wild. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Yes. It, it absolutely, it absolutely was. I mean, we were, I remember having cakewalk, I think before, you know, before computers even had graphical interfaces and, and connecting it to the, the Corg M1 in our living room and playing around with that. Right. So, I mean, it, it's just sort of always fascinated me. But it was interesting because electronics always sort of felt like they were just magical and something that I, I couldn't ever really get into. But within the past 10 years or so, with the amount of information that's just available on the internet, suddenly something that, you know, always sort of seemed out of out of reach became within reach because you can pretty much learn anything that you wanna learn if you're willing to devote the time to it now. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, it seems that way and it seems it's pretty darn powerful. Now. One of the things I'd say is that it's more than just the internet. I think it's actually very specifically the power behind, like the, the Make magazine and the O'Reilly people and, and like, spark fun. There was like mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, some kind of movement that came together and really propelled electronics from being a, like dark science to being a very public one. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Yeah, absolutely. I'm extremely thankful that that sort of revolution seems to have happened, because this is something that I've, I've always wanted to do. I've always been fascinated with electronics and I just didn't have any idea where to turn. And then within the past 10 years or so, getting involved in, in modular synthesis Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> first of all. And then, discovering the DIY side of that. And then from there, starting to just get deeper and deeper into it, if you wanna learn how stuff works, the, the ability to do so is, is there now and it's wonderful. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, indeed. So what, what specific path did you take for learning electronics? When I talk to people who kind of start off as a musician and come at electronics, they seem to do one of two things. Either they like get a bunch of kits and start off from the kit level and then start sort of like hacking the kits until they come up with something. And then there's another group of people that comes up with an idea and then sweats and grinds until they're able to make that idea come together without a whole lot of earlier, earlier art. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, which, which path did you take? Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>I would say a much more towards, towards the <span style="color:red" data-ts="787.405" data-end_ts="787.645" title="787.405" id=c_"787.405">__ladder__</span>. Okay. I, I had already been into building my own modules for a while, but hadn't really had any thought of developing anything like that. Interestingly, that, since I'm talking with you, I, I actually got an hardcore from somebody in a trade <laugh>. And, you know, I, ironically, the funny thing about that is that I, I didn't quite grasp what was going on there, and it sort of ended up on a shelf for a while. And then I think later that year, my wife got me an Arduino and I started playing around with that. And then suddenly something clicked <laugh> and I realized that the Arduino and the hardcore were one and the same. Right. And I suddenly turned around and, you know, just saw the immense possibilities with this. And I had, I had always wanted to build my own sequencer and had done so in reactor and in other different things like that, and suddenly I saw the possibility of making some of those ideas actually available in hardware Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b><affirmative>. And I just kind of said, you know, this is something I've always wanted to do. I've always wanted to build my own module and, I'm gonna do it. It took probably two and a half years or so from the time that I said, I'm going to do this to the time that it actually came out, you know, at least five different revisions of an actual circuit board, not including the endless varieties of, of breadboarding stuff. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But, it was an amazing learning experience and I think it actually worked out okay in the end. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, let's talk a little bit about this sequence here. The Times <span style="color:red" data-ts="893.375" data-end_ts="893.725" title="893.375" id=c_"893.375">__Arrow__</span>. It, it's, first of all, it for being your first module, you, you didn't take the easy route. <laugh>, this is <laugh>. This is an incredibly, complex and feature filled thing, and it fits into what looks, I'm guessing just from looking at it like 16 hp 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Yeah. I think it's 16 hp. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. And it's got like everything and it, and it, so, you know, you've got a source. You, you, you use buttons that I haven't seen on any other module. You've got, you pack in an awful lot of user interface into a relatively small amount of space. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, but it looks Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> looks like a really complex sequencer. Did you not have a desire to be like, I'm gonna put out an attenuator or something like that as a starting point? It seems like, it seems like taking a really big first bite. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>You know, it, it is a really big first bite. And to be honest, it was probably too large a first bite. You know, putting out an attenuator probably would've allowed me to put out a module within six months of deciding that I was going to do it instead of two and a half or three years. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Right. You know, but, but an attenuator is, is easy. And there's a million of them out there. And I, I decided, you know, I've always loved, I, I don't really know why, but I've always loved sequencers. Once I got the basic sequencer running, then, you know, then all of it is just code. And then I think at some point there <span style="color:red" data-ts="990.765" data-end_ts="990.885" title="990.765" id=c_"990.765">__was__</span>, there was definitely a point where I said, okay, I can't put everything that I've ever wanted into 16 HP and still make it work. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So there was a point where I actually started cutting stuff back and just tried to pare it down to the basics. I say that, but it's also very complex, but it's, it's complex in a way that I think makes sense for what the module is, if that makes sense. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Yeah. Well, I mean, it's, what I would say is that it has, you know, pretty much everything you'd want in a sequencer, but not a whole lot of extra, but it has some of the good stuff. I noticed you've got like probability built into it. You've got that cool constant time, 3 0 3 slide mm-Hmm. <affirmative> that I just think is such a compelling thing and, and is so useful or it's so difficult to do outside of the sequencer. Right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, it's like impossible to actually make it happen unless that slide function is intrinsic to the sequence. So it's Right. That kinda stuff is really, really cool and makes for a very comp, complete, sequencer. I, I too have, I spent my life being obsessed with sequencers. In fact, I joke often that, you know, I now I now work for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_%2774">Cycling '74</a> and I've been professionally working with Max for, I don't know, 15, almost 20 years. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, the whole thing started with my obsession towards getting the ultimate step sequencer. Right. I would build step sequencer after step sequencer. And you kind of talked about building them in reactor and stuff like that. Did you have like this concept formed in software? Or did you make like a model of it before you did it? Or did you start off with hardware and then seeing how much you could pack into the hardware? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>You know, I, somewhere in between the two, okay. I've been, I've been building sequencers like this in software for probably the past 10 or 15 years in various different versions with probably all of the different functionality of this. Maybe not in any one particular, but spread out amongst 15 different sequencers or so that I've built into reactor. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So in that sense, I think I've probably, worked out how these things should work in software, but I've always just really much preferred hardware interfaces when it comes to things like step sequences. To me at least there's just no, it just has to have buttons on it. There's just <laugh>, there's just no way to get around that. So the opportunity to be able to, to take those ideas and stick it in in hardware was really appealing to me. And I also have to admit that putting something in hardware makes it, you know, freezes it with a certain, certain things that it can do and also certain limitations. And in a way, I find that to be particularly good for actually making music with something because it means that I have to stop, I have to stop messing around building the sequencer and start actually building sequences. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. That's actually kind of a hard <span style="color:red" data-ts="1194.715" data-end_ts="1194.995" title="1194.715" id=c_"1194.715">__next__</span> step to, to mm-Hmm. <affirmative> basically say, I have to stop with the features and I have to start with the, I have to start using it. Now, one of, one of the things I'm, I'm curious about, so I've interviewed a number of people who have done a lot of modules, but you're one of the, one of the first people I've talked about with a relatively, you know, with a small module range. And so you're much closer to the beginning, you know, to the starting point than others. So I'm gonna ask some questions about that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>'cause I'm sure that, you know, for just about everybody who has a modular system, you also have a person who's like, well, I wish I could build modules, <laugh>, you know, who wouldn't wanna be a modular maker? Right. So let's ask some questions that would any modular, you know, wanna be, would, would ask. So first of all, doing something like the sequencer, it strikes me that it would have a pretty significant need for testing and stuff like that. But you didn't necessarily have an existing group of users to test. Did you become the Guinea pig? Or did you have a group of people that helped you out? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>I was the, the main Guinea pig by far. There were, people that I knew that helped me out with, with doing some of the beta testing on stuff, but I definitely did probably, you know, 80 to 90% of, of everything in there related to the testing just because it, you know, I also am the person who knows it the best. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And along with knowing it the best, that means that I'm the one who's in the best position to understand, you know, why it should do something or why it shouldn't. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Another question I would have, and again, this aligns a little bit with the, everybody would like to be a module maker. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you didn't necessarily have bones as either a experienced hardware maker nor a software developer. You chose a path here that required things like very tight timing, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you can't make a sequencer. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> that fumbles around with time. You can't make a sequencer that can't come straight. Right, right. So in addition to testing, I mean, you just had to have, you had to have really highly optimized and tight code in this too, in order for it to be valid. How did you get to that point? I mean, electronics is something that you can find enough of online to help out with. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> skilled coding is something that oftentimes takes a lot of experience. How did you get there? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Again, it was a very, forceful will, I suppose would be, would be a good way to put it. I had a little bit of coding experience before getting started, but, you can learn an impressive amount of stuff in two and a half to three years, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I guess, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1374.895" data-end_ts="1375.115" title="1374.895" id=c_"1374.895">__too__</span>. That's a good point. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Especially, you know, especially if you have a, a very clear focus as far as things go. I'm also a bit of a perfectionist, so it's, you know, it was very important to me that it didn't come out and it didn't have a bunch of bugs that people found later. So I just really pushed to make sure that everything was as well done as possible and as optimized as possible. And then I did take the, the final code that I had done and brought it to a couple different people who were professional coders to do, code reviews for it, you know, just to, to make sure that there wasn't anything 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Real <span style="color:red" data-ts="1417.905" data-end_ts="1418.185" title="1417.905" id=c_"1417.905">__hollow__</span> Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Essentially. So, but, but it was basically just a, a learning process. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Did you end up having to do any, updates to the, to the code after once it shipped? Or has it been solid throughout its lifetime? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>No, it's been solid throughout its lifetime. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's amazing. That's, that's actually, well, I'm, I'm serious because it's not easy firmware. I mean, you see it all the time with people that are shipping, shipping stuff, firmware updates come fast and furious sometimes because it's hard to get things a hundred percent. Right. That's, that's pretty impressive. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>I'm, I'm happy to have not had to do anything of that to be, to be fair, in my case, it was a matter of, you know, I understand that other, other companies that are in a bit more of a, a situation where that is specifically their job and have moved fully away from the, the hobby side of it, have to put things out fast enough that they can recoup their expenses. And I was fortunate in the position that, you know, while I was learning how to do a lot of this stuff, I was in school at the same time. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So it, it gave me, you know, if it took two years, if it took three years, if it took four years, I was sure that I was going to get it right before I put it out. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. You know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1507.065" data-end_ts="1507.285" title="1507.065" id=c_"1507.065">__the__</span>, it's interesting that you, you have sort of like, really taken advantage of the time that you gave yourself. That's pretty cool. So you, you were, you were in school at the time, but, you know, I would say that like for me, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1523.025" data-end_ts="1523.245" title="1523.025" id=c_"1523.025">__art__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1523.245" data-end_ts="1523.485" title="1523.245" id=c_"1523.245">__Corps__</span>, one of the, one of the reasons that I was compelled to do it was because I could use it to get my, I could use it as a project to get my degree right. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, it was a handy Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> of saying, I can do something that none of my instructors know anything about. So they won't be able to critique it very hard. <laugh>. Right, right. But, but it was also, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1547.005" data-end_ts="1547.125" title="1547.005" id=c_"1547.005">__I__</span> a compelling enough story that it would be academically sound you were taking, you were going to school for economics. So did, how, how did you manage both? I mean, two to three years of work on something sounds like a lot of time, unless you're also in school, getting an economics degree at the same time, that combination Right. Seems hard. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>It was difficult. I, I really enjoy learning stuff. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So, so maybe economics is another <laugh> <laugh>. No, I mean, it was, it was a lot of hard work, but it was enjoyable for me. And along with synthesizers and electronics, you know, they're all, as I'm sure you probably understand, these things are all sort of mental puzzles that are enjoyable to solve in their own way. There's actually a lot of crossover one wouldn't expect, but between things in economics and, and doing things in electronics or things with, with music even. I was fortunate enough that a lot of the economic stuff actually had, interestingly enough, a lot of the economic stuff that I was doing involved a lot of probability and probabilistic, modeling and stuff like that, which, you know, then came around to help with the programming side. Right. And also led to a lot of the ideas with doing the probability in the, the module side of it. Sure. So there's definitely some, some cross pollination there that one might not expect to show up in a module. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's, that I hadn't even thought of there being a connection there, but that's, that's pretty smart. Pretty fascinating. Let's talk a little bit about this new series of modules since you, you opened the door on those. I want to ask about that. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Again, the modules are, oscillator. You're <span style="color:red" data-ts="1668.285" data-end_ts="1668.325" title="1668.285" id=c_"1668.285">__gonna__</span> have envelopes, you're gonna have the gate. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>So basically these are these recreations of the, the original 100 series. So the first five that I'm doing are the, the 1 58 A, which is, the original modular oscillator. It's a, sign to Sawtooth Oscillator. Okay. There's the 1 0 6, which is a six channel mixer. There is the one 10, which is a quad VCA. There is the 1 56, which is a control voltage processor, and the 180, which is a dual envelope generator. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, one of the things that I don't hear in there is any kind of filtering. Now, some of this, some of that probably comes from, ULA was kind of always, he had this really interesting view of how synthesis worked, which is that, you know, it's complexity in complexity in modulation of the oscillator where you get tunnel variations rather than like more standard subtractive synthesis where you have an oscillator and then a filter. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So in this Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> kinda voice, you get <span style="color:red" data-ts="1752.005" data-end_ts="1752.205" title="1752.005" id=c_"1752.005">__the__</span>, that the tonal variations then from like, that on the oscillator, moving from the sign to the sawtooth waveform, is that, is that kind of what it, what it's meant to be and then, and then fing from there? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Yeah, there's a, you know, I, I would say that the basic building block sort of starts with the, the sine wave in the oscillators, and then either through sweeping that to the sawtooth or through Ming, the oscillator with itself gives you a, a lot more of that high frequency content. So exactly like you said, it's, it's sort of the, the opposite view from the, the typical East Coast type synthesis where you start with all of the harmonics and then filter down the sort of original West Coast idea was that you start with the pure wave and then do things to add the harmonics into that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. But you said that these are all scaled so that they use the standard, one volt proactive range and, and the standard negative five to five volt swing on the, on the signals. Right. So are these available now? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>These should be available by the time that you hear this. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, fantastic. And what, how big are they? Are they, are they slim modules or, or larger format? What, what's the size of them? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>The size of each one of these modules is 14 hp, so you can actually fit six of them, in 180 4 hp, row essentially. And part of that was we wanted to keep the, the original look of the modules. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So in the original 100 series, all of the modules were a standard, panel size. And, you know, you could only, they only came in multiples of that size. So we, we chose 14. I keep saying we, but, me essentially <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Me, chose it, chose, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Yeah. Chose 14 HP because it felt like it worked with the, the original look and it allowed for a, a set number of modules per 84 HP row. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. It's a real compelling choice to, to do the Bookla 100 series, because I think that that's something that hasn't been, hasn't been dived into it that much. I think some of it is because they're just hard to ever even come, come upon. Have you ever played a 100? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Yes. Actually, that's, that's exactly, that was part of the reason that these happened was simply because, because of the fact that they are so hard to find that they're, in a way, they're kind of the ultimate sense that everybody has, well, everyone who's, who's into synthesizers in particular, people that are into more of that West coast, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1944.435" data-end_ts="1944.715" title="1944.435" id=c_"1944.435">__Brooklyn__</span> surge kind of aesthetic, these are, it's kind of the system that everybody has seen everybody knows about, but very few people have actually had the opportunity to play with one. So that was definitely part of the, the inspiration in doing these was simply because I had never had an opportunity to play with them either. And I, I wanted these to exist so that I could have that opportunity. Fortunately, after I showed, I showed a bunch of prototypes of these at last year's, well, I guess it's this year's 2017 namm, and I met some people there who did have access to the system at Mills College. And so I was very fortunate enough to go up to Mills College and spend, a couple days up there with all of my, oscilloscopes and other test equipment <laugh>, going through and, and doing one-to-one comparisons between the modules that I had done and the original, 100 series that they had at Mills College, which was actually the original San Francisco Tape Music center Right. System. Right. So that was an amazing experience. And, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Boy, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2027.715" data-end_ts="2028.005" title="2027.715" id=c_"2027.715">__talk__</span> about <span style="color:red" data-ts="2028.715" data-end_ts="2029.205" title="2028.715" id=c_"2028.715">__history__</span>. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Yes, exactly. <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>So that was, that was really cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And did, did they end up kind of specking out pretty close? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>They did. It was actually pretty amazing at some point. I haven't put these these up on our website because I simply want to, I'm, I'm a big fan of, of not putting things on websites until they're actually available. Sure, sure. But there's some pictures that I took that, we did some tests with the Mills College oscillator running through the, VCA controlled by the envelope function generator, basically. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, of the original 100 system. And then did the same thing with the same set of, of modules from my series, and they were completely indistinguishable. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, that's cool. Really nice. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Yeah, they were, they even have the same <laugh>, the same peculiarities, that show up. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So now that you've had, I mean, it's interesting. So you're like one of the first people to kind of have this new version of the 100 and mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you're lucky enough to have as many of them as you need. How, how are you finding it just from a musical standpoint? How, how are you enjoying working with it and what are the things that surprise you about it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Well, they're, I find them really fun to work with. Part of that might be just because, you know, I, I appreciate the history behind them, and it's kind of fascinating. It sort of feels like, in a way, I'm the first person that's had the opportunity to play with these in, in a really long time, is kind of what it feels like. Yeah. From a musical perspective, it's, it's actually very interesting. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2146.795" data-end_ts="2147.285" title="2146.795" id=c_"2146.795">__Kristin__</span> and I have talked a lot about this, but the system really leads you to a certain type of musical expression, I suppose would be the best way to put it, in the sense that it's almost like within five minutes of starting to patch stuff up, it almost invariably starts sounding like Martin, Morton Sabo. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. I was gonna say <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Yeah. I mean, it just, it, it's funny because listening to that now, after playing with this, you're like, oh, well, that's just, that's the natural inclination of, of the system in the same way that maybe, you know, something like a 3 0 3 has a natural inclination to doing certain types of, of sounds and that leads to a certain type of music. Right, exactly. These have their own inclination that leads to certain sounds. And, and you can certainly go outside of that. You know, they're not, it's not like that's the only thing that they do, but they're, there definitely feels like there's a very strong, almost like they're drawing you towards making stuff that sounds like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, pity we should all have that <laugh> have that feeling. I'll tell you what, if I could spend the rest of my life sounding more like Horton <span style="color:red" data-ts="2233.965" data-end_ts="2234.405" title="2233.965" id=c_"2233.965">__Botnick__</span>, I think I'd feel pretty good about my life, you know, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Yeah. It's, it's pretty, it's pretty amazing. It's kind of fascinating. They're very, they're very hands on is another thing that I've, I've noticed, I think, because at the time period, the having CV control over everything wasn't really a part of the philosophy, at least not until the 200 series. The 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>200 series, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Yeah. So these are very much, they influence you to, to play with them much more. They're, in order to really get the best out of them, you have to have it, you know, in your lap or in front of you and be twisting knobs in, in real time as part of a performance. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. Well, that's, that's funny you say that. One of the things I remember, I didn't think about it that way, but you're right. My experience with BUCA 100 stuff was working, in Grant Richter's basement. He had a combination 100, 200 system, and I remember really being drawn to the 100 series just because, the panels weren't very dense. And so there was like Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> a lot of it was, it was almost luxurious the amount of room that were around the knobs and stuff. Right. It seemed to, it seemed to really be inviting as a place to sort of like, set your hand and, and go to work. Right. I always thought that they were, they really had a very unique vibe to 'em, and, and hands-on is a great way to put it. It it, it was inviting for that kind of stuff. Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b><affirmative> they feel like they're, they're meant to be played as opposed to to meaning to be programmed. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Right. I don't know enough about the 100 series to know what might be next. You're coming out with these initial five modules. How many different modules? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> were available in the 100 series? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>You know, I don't know if there's even a specific number. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> because there are a number of things that I know, ULA started and maybe made three, one-offs, right? Yeah. <laugh>. Yeah, exactly. There was, at Mills when I was up there, there was a, a fascinating, I think it was an oscillator that allowed you to set, you know, 64 different break points and basically you could draw your wave shape in using knobs on the front. And I've never seen that anywhere else. I think that may have been a, been a one-off. And I think there's a few, few other things that maybe, you know, there were maybe five May. There were maybe 10. So it, it's a, it's a bit hard to say. There are probably about 20 or so core modules I would say. Okay. You know, I have plans to, to hopefully if, if this first set of modules doesn't end up bankrupting me, <laugh>, then, you know, I, I would like to continue doing these to, to round out that series. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. And then going back to sort of how you started this company. What is your, and, and the fact that you've always had this obsession with sequencing, are you going to continue work on sequencers as well, or is your focus really gonna be on this, this, <inaudible> style voicing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Right now it's pretty much focused on doing these 100 <span style="color:red" data-ts="2445.305" data-end_ts="2445.745" title="2445.305" id=c_"2445.305">__serious__</span> modules. I'd like to get those, those out. I feel like now that I've, I've started the project, I feel that they're, it's necessary to complete it. <laugh>, I just wouldn't feel 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Wouldn't feel like I could leave it halfway done <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>I don't, I don't know exactly why, but so after I, after I get that done, I definitely have some ideas for going back to, to other stuff. It's kind of funny 'cause the, the sequencer and these modules are, couldn't possibly be more different. Right. Yet still be within the same, you know, frame of, of electronic music. Yeah. But I, I do like both sides of it and I would like to go back and I have a, a bunch of, of ideas for different sequencing, I suppose, type of, of ideas. So I'll definitely go back to that stuff and maybe do some more digital stuff in the future. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Well, Dave, our time's already up. I can't believe that we blew through that so quickly. It was, really interesting to hear about this and I am definitely anxious to get some hands on time with these, 100 style modules, but I also need to find a way to get my hands on that sequencer that looks, looks like Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> such a, a draw to me. I really appreciate the work you're doing and I appreciate you taking the time to talk, man. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Well, thank you very much for, for having me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. And, good luck with, good luck with the kickoff. I, again, by the time people hear this, hopefully they're gonna be available and hopefully I'll be finding room in my rack as well. A bunch of other people will be finding room in their racks as well. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So, good luck with that launch, man. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Thank you very much. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright. And with that, I'll let you have the rest of your day. Thank you so much. And, and good day. Alright, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dave: </b>Thanks Darwin. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, there you go. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2577.165" data-end_ts="2577.585" title="2577.165" id=c_"2577.165">__Bookla__</span> modules, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2578.025" data-end_ts="2578.385" title="2578.025" id=c_"2578.025">__Bookla__</span> 100 modules. Eh, isn't <span style="color:red" data-ts="2579.945" data-end_ts="2580.105" title="2579.945" id=c_"2579.945">__that__</span> amazing? But if you haven't seen the sequencer, you probably want to check out as well. It's really interesting work. Thanks to Clifton again for helping, track Dave down. And, thanks to you for listening, for continuing to share this with your friends. Our numbers, as always are great. And again, I would really, ask you to consider, funding my Kickstarter campaign. Again, you can go to kickstarter.com, just search for art, music technology, and you'll run across our Mike preUpdate, thing that's running until December 10th. With that, I'm going to let you go and I'll talk to you again on Sunday. Bye.
