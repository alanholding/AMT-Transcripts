<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. This week we have a interesting little chat with Jeremy Bernstein I'll fill you in more during the interview, but, just another note, again, this week we have little Skype schmutz in there. I don't know exactly what's causing it, but it seems like we might've found a culprit in a rogue Dropbox instance. So, anyway, we hopefully have cleaned that up for the future, but towards the end it gets a little messy. You just plow through it because there's great stuff. I hope you enjoy. I'll see you at the backside. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. This week I am going to introduce you to somebody that I've known for a long time. I've worked with him for a long time. Every time we get together, it seems like it's old friends talking. It's really, it's really cool. He's a, an amazing developer, but also a guy with a real great variety of interests. His name is Jeremy Bernstein He's one of the developers at Cycling 74. He's got a long history of performance and artwork, and he's got some new obsessions that he's into. So with that, I'm going to introduce you to Jeremy Bernstein Hi, Jeremy. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeremy Bernstein: </b>I'm good. Thanks for inviting me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, thanks a lot for joining us. This is kind of a real treat for me because, like I just said, I always feel like every time you and I talk, it's just like old friends getting together again. You know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeremy: </b>It's, <laugh>. I know what you mean. It's, it's super and it's, it'll be nice to catch up. Yeah, indeed. In public <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. Yeah. With people watching over our shoulders. <laugh>. So why don't we start off by having you identify, how you think of yourself? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeremy: </b>That's a, it's a hard question. It's changed over the last many years. I think I used to, identify myself, principally as a, as a musician for a long time, and then as a visual artist for a while. And, for the last several years, I mostly identify as a software developer, and as a mediocre chess player. But, you know, most of what I spend my time doing these days is, as you mentioned, working for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_%2774">Cycling '74</a> as a developer, max, mostly working on, well, I started working on jitter for the first version of Jitter and then gradually moved out into other areas of the software. In particular stuff dealing with state management and parameter stuff and Max for live. And then in the, recent past, I've been working more on some, more interface facing user facing kinds of things like the, the new file browser and stuff in max seven. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeremy: </b>So it's been sort of an interesting development on the, the max end of things. But in addition to Max and sort of related to my chess obsession, I've been working with a team of chess programmers on, a chess program called Komodo. My involvement in it is largely on the fringe. Basically helping them with more generic programming problems like, like threading, like, integrating external technologies into the base hardcore chess engine. But Komodo is at the moment, one of the two. It might be depends on the weak, strongest chess player, chess programs in the world. So that's sort of an interesting project to be, to be working on as well, even if it's, not really my project, but it's, it's a kind of fascinating to, to see how, a computer simulates, human <span style="color:red" data-ts="233.635" data-end_ts="233.925" title="233.635" id=c_"233.635">__game__</span>. So. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm gonna want to come back to that, but before we get there, I'm curious about a couple of things of some of your earlier life. So first of all, you said you originally sort of identified as a musician. What instrument did you play and what kind of work did you do there? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeremy: </b><laugh>? Well, I think, yeah, my first instrument was, piano. I mean, I should, I should make it absolutely 100% clear as an instrumentalist. I am mediocre at best. So I was second chair clarinet, after taking piano lessons, starting at, I, I think I took piano from <span style="color:red" data-ts="270.175" data-end_ts="270.525" title="270.175" id=c_"270.175">__seven__</span> to 17 or something like that. Right. And then I played clarinet in elementary school band. At some point I picked up the trombone for a while because they needed somebody to fill in, in the, in the brass section at my high school band. But at that time, I had already started, taking some music theory classes and some light music history, doing some conducting. And then by the time I had, my junior and senior year of high school, I had started composing music. They had this interesting mentorship program in Howard County, Maryland where I grew up. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeremy: </b>And you could basically get paired up with a professional in some field of interest and, meet with them once or, once or twice a month, I think. And so I found a composer who was teaching at the time at, the Peabody Institute. Greg Geiger was his name. And, he basically mentored me in, getting started writing music at that point. I applied to Oberlin College, conservatory of Music in the music composition program, and, was there for five years. Wow. And, wrote, you know, a lot of music, mostly for instruments, but also kind of had an opportunity starting in my second year there to work in an actual, you know, music studio with computers and, boxes that made noises and old Arc 2,600 and some, you know, the VCs three with the Cricklewood keyboard and all these <laugh>, all these great toys. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeremy: </b>And, that was actually where I had my first fleeting, but impressive contact with Max. So that's kind of my, where I got started in, in music. And, after I left college, and I moved to New York City and I had kind of, you know, I had sort of lost then my entire conservatory of music support system, all of these musicians, that you could kind of knock on doors and get people to play pieces for you <span style="color:red" data-ts="402.465" data-end_ts="402.685" title="402.465" id=c_"402.465">__and__</span> Right. Have you have friends, and you're like, okay, well I'll write something for you because you will <laugh> you'll humor, you'll humor me. <span style="color:red" data-ts="409.685" data-end_ts="409.925" title="409.685" id=c_"409.685">__Yeah__</span>. Humor me and actually play it <laugh>, stuff like that. And so, I began to take the electronic music stuff, quite a bit more seriously. And in New York, I was pretty actively involved in writing, a lot of electronic music for theater and dance. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeremy: </b>That's sort of still where, I think I have my, my greatest passion is writing music that people use. Right. I think that that's really important to me. And something that was a bit of a result of the, the institutional composition background that I had, which is that you just sort of feel like you write piece after piece, it gets played once and then you put it on the shelf. And, part of that has to do with being a composer in training. That's just, you know, the way things happen. But I think that that is, <laugh> very likely also the experience of any number of professional composers unless you are, wildly successful enough that you get multiple performances of your work. Right. Having, having the opportunity to, to work with people who are hungry to hear something new and who are, who are using it, made just a huge impression on me. And, probably then, you know, fed as well my interest in, in working with visuals a little bit later on. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So to, what <span style="color:red" data-ts="490.765" data-end_ts="490.845" title="490.765" id=c_"490.765">__is__</span>, to what extent was Oberlin and that music studio and that computer music environment, to what extent was that your first experience with programming? Or did you have a technical background as well? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeremy: </b>I didn't really have a technical background, but that said, I guess I've been a nerd since I was a kid. <laugh>. And, like, if I think about it, we didn't have a PC at home, but at some point, I don't remember how old I was. I must've been like nine or 10 years old. And, my parents bought this Texas Instruments 99 4 a computer that you would load new programs into it, either via a cassette player or they had these cartridges. And one of the cartridges that we got was, extended basic. There used to be a, some magazines that would publish like Bike Magazine or something. Right. And they would publish programming listings for like this cool game. And, if you were lucky, the ti I 99 was, spotlight that, that month, and they would've a couple of programs for your computer. And then, you know, I would just sit down for a couple of days and type out <laugh> word for word the, the program listing. And at the end, I would have some game where you could fly AB around through a Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="569.485" data-end_ts="569.605" title="569.485" id=c_"569.485">__A__</span> pixel field of flowers or whatever. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. What I remember most of that time period is then you had to leave the computer on until you were sick of the game because it, it was almost impossible to get the cassette storage to ever actually work 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeremy: </b><laugh>. Right. Or you would save it off to your, your cassette recorder. Of course. Yeah. And then you could load it back in. It's interesting, I just had another experience with this cassette recorder technology two days ago, but we can talk about that another day <span style="color:red" data-ts="597.505" data-end_ts="597.725" title="597.505" id=c_"597.505">__or__</span> another in, in a few minutes. But, the, so there was that at some point when I was a kid, I took a, I took summer school programming workshop, and I remember the thing I remember, I don't remember what programs we wrote, but we weren't allowed to actually write our programs until we had made a complete logical flow chart on paper. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> of, I mean, with all the, you know, the logic symbols and stuff, <span style="color:red" data-ts="624.085" data-end_ts="624.325" title="624.085" id=c_"624.085">__little__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Symbols, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeremy: </b>Yeah. Connected together. And then you would bring that up to the front to the teacher and he would like, look it over and check your logic. And then he'd be like, okay, you can go to the computer and, and do that. So that was something. And, logo, I learned at some point in middle school, I made some sort of like break dance video using the logo turtle to, Herbie Han, was it Herbie Hancock Mega Mix. Right. Right. Is that, is that one of his, things, it might have been the Thomas Dolby version of the Herbie <span style="color:red" data-ts="657.365" data-end_ts="657.565" title="657.365" id=c_"657.365">__Can__</span> Hancock Mega Mix. Oh, <laugh>. Anyway, so yeah, that's like this integration of, visuals and sound and programming has, I guess, been a little bit always a theme Right. In my wanderings. But, you know, it's not like it's intentional or anything like that, it's just sort of what happens. So, but yes. To get back to the actual question, that was kind of my first experience using professional, any sort of professional audio equipment. Mm-Hmm. <span style="color:red" data-ts="691.085" data-end_ts="691.125" title="691.085" id=c_"691.085">__<affirmative>__</span>. I had, I had a keyboard when I was in high school, and I played in a band and, we played like Genesis covers and <span style="color:red" data-ts="700.025" data-end_ts="700.445" title="700.025" id=c_"700.025">__Marion__</span> covers and stuff like that. My trustee, Roland Alpha, Juno <span style="color:red" data-ts="705.385" data-end_ts="705.605" title="705.385" id=c_"705.385">__two__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, nice. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeremy: </b>Accompanied me on many adventures. Right. Playing Abba <span style="color:red" data-ts="710.565" data-end_ts="710.765" title="710.565" id=c_"710.565">__Cab__</span>, but, <laugh>, but in terms terms of like having a sequencer and, those were like the first years I think that I was at school at the time when, like vision became studio vision and performer became, digital performer. <span style="color:red" data-ts="726.965" data-end_ts="727.205" title="726.965" id=c_"726.965">__Yeah__</span>. And suddenly <span style="color:red" data-ts="727.835" data-end_ts="728.125" title="727.835" id=c_"727.835">__were__</span> able, digital audio was real digital audio I learned Max, in summer term, I think after my second year or something. Gary Nelson, was in charge of the electronic studios back then, and he had a, he had a Max Summer workshop back then, and, I wanted to take a class of his the following semester, and I needed to know Max in order to, in order to take that class called Mathematical Modeling and Musical Composition or something like that, which basically meant music with fractals. Right. So I took his, or I, I volunteered to TD his summer course as kind of a motivation to learn Max, and that was my first contact with any sort of sound music programming. Right. Back then Max was a tiny, tiny program that could do midi. Yep. And I think there was some extension that would let you play old Macintosh SND files or something. <laugh>, yeah. Sort of back then it really, it was for making midi effects and for controlling data flow. And that was my first real experience doing anything that, that had any kind of musical usefulness. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I think it's, you know, it's kind of interesting to think back to those times that how even getting, you know, getting reasonable timing on MIDI from the computers of the time was pretty, pretty tough sledding. And then, especially when the digital audio stuff, I was a studio, you know, I took the dive into the studio <span style="color:red" data-ts="822.685" data-end_ts="823.085" title="822.685" id=c_"822.685">__vision__</span> when it came out, and I just remember being just blown away that I could get two whole tracks of audio on a computer Right. And ready too, you know, it was pretty amazing. And at the, at the same time, it, it represents limitations that nowadays we would find just completely <span style="color:red" data-ts="842.945" data-end_ts="843.165" title="842.945" id=c_"842.945">__la__</span> we would think it was unartistic to use such a thing. Right. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeremy: </b>I mean, I had, I think when I moved to New York and I had a, oh, what did I have in my, I had some sort of a digital design card in, in my computer. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I think it was a four channel audio card, and that meant that you had four tracks of audio. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. In, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeremy: </b>In your sequencer, and you couldn't get any extra tracks. And if you wanted to use more virtual, you couldn't do virtual tracks. You had to actually bounce down. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It was like using a cassette recorder only <span style="color:red" data-ts="872.445" data-end_ts="872.605" title="872.445" id=c_"872.445">__with__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="872.965" data-end_ts="873.085" title="872.965" id=c_"872.965">__a__</span> computer interface. Yeah. It's kind of crazy. And 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeremy: </b>I listened, I listened to the tracks I made back then. I'm like, oh my God. You know, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="879.605" data-end_ts="879.725" title="879.605" id=c_"879.605">__could__</span>, I didn't have any, I didn't have cross fades. I Right. Couldn't, couldn't do any of the sort of flexible things that you can do now. But 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It still sounded pretty good, didn't it? Because we put in a lot of extra sweat, you know? Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeremy: </b>You, you work really hard to get around the limitations and, it creates friction with your material. And I think that's, that's also kind of important. Yeah. For the process. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>When is it that you started getting into video? Because my, under my recollection is that you were sort of doing video work prior to working for cycling. You were kind of, you were doing performances. 'cause I've heard a lot of people talk about some of your early performances as being really influential to them in terms of getting into, in, into computer-based visual work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeremy: </b>Oh, that's nice to hear. Yeah. <laugh>, so, well, I think I was already working for cycling. Oh, okay. When I did this, my first job for cycling was maintaining the, the forum. Oh, alright. I think, if, if I can digress for the story of me working for Cycling was, I wrote this really long email. There used to be this, McGill list for, for the Max community. And, I wrote this long email about how it's ridiculous that the, that this company with this vibrant community doesn't have its own mailing list and <laugh>, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="975.605" data-end_ts="975.805" title="975.605" id=c_"975.605">__civic__</span> pain in the butt, and could we, could cycling please, you know, consider doing something like this. And then I got an email back from, from David. At some point I had been doing a little bit of beta testing, and at some point in the previous to that, I had sent him an email and I was like, I can't do anything, but do you have a position at cycling for somebody like that? He, at the time, had responded in the negative that in fact, there was, there was no position at cycling at that time for somebody who couldn't do anything. But after I wrote this email on the, on the old mailing list, he wrote me, well actually, you know, if you wanted to spearhead this effort, that's probably, something that somebody who can't do anything could do <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeremy: </b>And why don't we give it a shot? And so that was my first job, at cycling. But the video stuff, I wasn't doing any programming for cycling. And in fact, I wasn't doing any programming, outside of Max. I didn't know how to program in a text language except for logo and extended basic. So at that time, we were using nato, I guess was, was what was available for, for Max to, to use video. And I had always been frustrated with Max because I, I found Max <span style="color:red" data-ts="1052.225" data-end_ts="1052.445" title="1052.225" id=c_"1052.225">__as__</span> sort of like a live as a processing environment where you could make kind of cool textures and then maybe reuse them somewhere. Or for making a kind of like a, a basic sound installation. That's how I'd used Max in the past, or for doing sort of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1067.085" data-end_ts="1067.285" title="1067.085" id=c_"1067.085">__medium__</span> manipulation. But I'd never, never figured out a way to compose using, this programming methodology. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeremy: </b>Okay. And that was always very frustrating to me. Sure. However, when NATO came out, I was sort of very excited about the, the possibilities of working with images. And, and that came a little bit out of my, my work with theater and dance, where I was working a lot with kind of a visual context for the work that I was doing, for the musical work that I was doing. But the downside of that was that I had to deal with these actors and these dancers and these directors and, you know, sometimes you would just want to do something alone. And, but I was missing this visual element. So I thought, okay, well maybe, maybe there's something here. Maybe I can, maybe I can find my own visual environment to work within and maybe this tool will help me. And I think that the fact that I was such a, a naive novice in the video world, I had studied art history. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeremy: </b>I did a double degree program at Oberlin. And three of my years there were, were working on an art history degree before I dropped out of that program. But, so I had some, some background in visual art, but not as a maker, more as a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1138.115" data-end_ts="1138.235" title="1138.115" id=c_"1138.115">__a__</span>, you know, an academic. Right. But, you know, as a, as a a visual artist, I had absolutely no credentials whatsoever. And so I felt a certain freedom to work with these visual materials that I didn't really have with the, with the musical materials where I was a little bit, you know, stuck in certain ways of working as the result of, you know, several years of practice of, of making the kind of music that I was liking. So I was, I was, you know, very inspired to kind of, to play around with these toys. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeremy: </b>And at a certain point, I, I realized that the kinds of things that I wanted to do were taxing the system too much. And so I learned how to write enough c to write some faster graphics filters in order to use these, these NATO tools. And at that time, I, I got a job, or not a job, you know, a gig doing some ving at Sub Tonic, which was the, the basement club underneath Tonic right in, in the lower East side of New York. Kurt Roski got me the gig, and we did kind of like a, a video tag team. And that was this incredible laboratory for me because I had a day job. I was fixing laptops, and in the evening I would come home and fixing laptops. You don't use your brain at all, <laugh>, you, you use your hands. It's, it's basically, you know, your unscrewing thing back then, you could actually take a laptop apart and replace things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeremy: </b>And, you were a screwdriver user at the time. I was a screwdriver user and my brain was free all day to think about what I was gonna do that night. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, so I would come home, pull out whatever compiler it is that we were using, and I'd, I'd start working on some filter that I had an idea for. And then on Friday night, we'd go down to, to Subtonic and, I'd get to try out my new filters. Right. And, some of them would be cool, and some of them would be horrible, and some of them would be too slow. Whatever, you just get this I, not immediate, but this, immediate enough feedback as part of the development of this kind of like large VJ program that I was working on, just for me. Right. And then all the filters that, that were built into it. And so that was an incredibly productive time, both artistically, but also, in terms of my development of programming chops. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeremy: </b>Although, it was interesting because for years I couldn't actually program any, I couldn't like program a program <laugh>, in, in <span style="color:red" data-ts="1295.885" data-end_ts="1296.005" title="1295.885" id=c_"1295.885">__c__</span> the only thing I knew how to make were max objects. Max 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Objects. Yeah. I hear that. It's interesting that you talk about, working on laptops, freeing your brain. You know, when I first started doing programming, that was almost exactly my experience. I was, I had a job as the maker of crates. I was the person who, who made crates. And so it was, I mean, it was such a prescribed job that I knew that I could do, two crates an hour, 16 crates a day. No matter how fast or how slow I tried working, it would, it would be exactly the same. Right. So I was a hammer user and <laugh>, I kept a little notebook where I would like scratch ideas so I could run home and coat 'em up when I got home. Right. And that was, that was how I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1343.965" data-end_ts="1344.125" title="1343.965" id=c_"1343.965">__kind__</span> of got started as well. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1345.515" data-end_ts="1345.805" title="1345.515" id=c_"1345.515">__Yeah__</span>. Thank God for these kind of like low end labor jobs that let us all get our wrap our heads around it. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeremy: </b><laugh>, they're good jobs if you can get 'em. I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1356.045" data-end_ts="1356.245" title="1356.045" id=c_"1356.045">__guess__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So you were a NATO user and what I recall is you ended up in kind of a shit storm over that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeremy: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Mainly because the developer of the NATO software was, you know, perhaps insane 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeremy: </b><laugh>. I had my license officially revoked. Like so many of us back then, the, I don't remember if it was revoked because I was thinking badly or if it was revoked because I was being accused of stealing her intellectual property

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Or for being American. I mean, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeremy: </b>It could have been that I was an imperialist American. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1395.865" data-end_ts="1396.085" title="1395.865" id=c_"1395.865">__It__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1396.085" data-end_ts="1396.205" title="1396.085" id=c_"1396.085">__could__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1396.205" data-end_ts="1396.405" title="1396.205" id=c_"1396.205">__be__</span>. But yeah, for the benefit of anybody who's listening who doesn't know, what NATO was or who who its maker was, so NATO was this video framework for Max pre jitter developed by, a kind of collective called Natasha Anova. Natasha Anova was, in addition to being the programmer of this thing, of <laugh> of this modular system, I think her greatest talent was destroying online communities. Right. There were any number of sort of like arts based online communities where she showed up and, she kind of spoke in this combination of asci art and Danish and punctuation. Yeah. So lead speak and would get all the tight asses really annoyed and all of the, the hippies would be like, you know, don't our, she's okay. It's all right. And, eventually it would lead to her getting banned and then half the community leaving because protesting that some women would get banned for being special and whatever. So, complicated personality. But, anyway, there was a bunch of research done. I remember I was interviewed, it must have been <span style="color:red" data-ts="1474.925" data-end_ts="1475.125" title="1474.925" id=c_"1474.925">__yet__</span>, 10 years ago or something. Somebody was doing a documentary about, about her. I don't know if that ever, if that ever came out. The last I heard there was a programmer in like a Romanian programmer living in the suburbs of Chicago. There was Rebecca Wilson from New Zealand, who, she sort

<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1496.205" data-end_ts="1496.285" title="1496.205" id=c_"1496.205">__Of__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1496.585" data-end_ts="1496.805" title="1496.585" id=c_"1496.585">__was__</span> like the face of it, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeremy: </b>She was the face, and she had, had her name officially changed to Natasha Anova, and she got the job at, at, at Stein in am, in Amsterdam. So she had the production manager job at Stein and then, left later to make a Pro Tools plugin or something like that. And then there was a third one who I think was the poet who probably was responsible for any number of the, of the emails. In any case, that was a super cool, very interesting system written for Max, that let you do things, with visuals that were just impossible to consider. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It was, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1536.425" data-end_ts="1536.645" title="1536.425" id=c_"1536.425">__it__</span> was so visionary for however one felt about Natasha, the work at the time was real visionary work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeremy: </b>Yeah. I mean, the idea that you could, you know, pass around a, a bit map and break it into pieces and process each one separately and put it back, I mean, just the same way that you were doing with, with Sound in Max and in other programs. But, you know, nobody had really been able to do that in, in visuals yet. David Rocha <span style="color:red" data-ts="1567.395" data-end_ts="1567.555" title="1567.395" id=c_"1567.395">__be__</span>, was was approaching that as well with his very nervous system. Right, right. But I think the very nervous system was still a, a monolithic object that did a lot of stuff at the time that Nnn released NATO Modular, and David made the, the modular version of the very nervous system later that was also super powerful. Then Jitter came out shortly thereafter and, you know, Joshua had started working on Jitter even, well, he had started working on Jitter, I guess already in 2000. I met him for the first time in 2000 at the Death festival. He was already programming Proto Jitter at that point. I got involved, I don't know, maybe nine months later. And my, my, you know, my original job working on that was, just porting my NATO filters over to the Jitter framework, but then it got a little bit out of hand. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I wanna ask you a little bit about what New York was like at the time, because my recollection was, while people in spots all around the world were kind of playing around with digital generated video, it seemed like New York was really a center for this laptop video thing. I mean, you and Kurt particularly were, were people that were doing a lot of groundbreaking stuff. But, but you know, I remember I interviewed Josh Goldberg, he was like, you know, he started off hauling VCR decks around and then ran across this stuff and started messing with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1656.445" data-end_ts="1656.525" title="1656.445" id=c_"1656.445">__the__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1656.525" data-end_ts="1656.645" title="1656.525" id=c_"1656.525">__you__</span> know, there was a lot of activity in New York at the time. What was it about New York that was specifically video driven? Was it just that there was this club or some clubs, or was there something else that was kind of, at least in your experience that was kind of involved? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeremy: </b>Yeah, it's really hard. It's really, really hard to say. I think it was just sort of a, it was a moment. It was like the moment where this became technically possible without having to lug a video synthesizer around with you. Sure. I mean, we still had to lug our projector <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeremy: </b>Around, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1694.725" data-end_ts="1694.845" title="1694.725" id=c_"1694.725">__I__</span> mean, it wasn't like, and you know, our laptops and whatever, but, but I think this was sort of like the cutting edge moment where suddenly you could do this with a laptop. Right. But, you know, at Subtonic there was, there were nights where people would come in, with like, you know, the equivalent of a lamp and a flashlight, and they would <laugh> they would do graphics or an overhead projector and stuff like that. I mean, our night was just, it was just digital, but it wasn't like, right. I mean, there was, there was like subtonic, there was also a couple of years later, there was, there was this, this place called Remote Lounge, which was <laugh>. It was maybe like, you know, the equivalent, it must have been like around 2000. And it was the, the 2000 era version of, Tinder. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeremy: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1741.425" data-end_ts="1741.645" title="1741.425" id=c_"1741.425">__Wow__</span>. And the idea was that you had all these consoles strewn throughout the bar, and each console could be, had a camera and might have had a microphone, I don't remember. But each console could then switch to any of the other consoles, <laugh>. And if you saw something that you liked, you could press the, oh <span style="color:red" data-ts="1760.525" data-end_ts="1760.765" title="1760.525" id=c_"1760.525">__geez__</span>. You could press a button and notify the other console that somebody would like to talk to them. So it was essentially a <laugh>, it was essentially a pickup bar, but, it was based on technology in their dungeon. They also had, a nice setup with a pretty well <span style="color:red" data-ts="1776.935" data-end_ts="1777.285" title="1776.935" id=c_"1776.935">__stock__</span> video booth and a good screen and a built-in projector and everything kind of set up so that you could come in and, set up your gear and do an audio visual show. There were a couple of places uptown, I can't remember what they're called anymore, where they had sort of lab nights where people would come and do, it wasn't like circuit bending, it was basically come and plug in and show us what you're working on kind of nights. Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Kinda like they're doing the bring your own Beamer stuff now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeremy: </b>And, you know, New York of course has, it has the new school and it has NYU, it has Columbia, it's got all these places with heavy technology and, you know, computer design programs at Luke Dubo Columbia. Back then Joshua Goldberg was teaching at New School. And I think it was just a, it was a good moment where the fact that this stuff was now possible made people interested in it. And the fact that people were able to get jobs teaching this or going out and and gigging this, made it all the more interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So that's, that does sound like a pretty amazing time. Now you got involved in jitter and that story seems pretty amazing 'cause you guys did a, a shocking amount of work in a small amount of time. What was your primary work in Witter? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeremy: </b>Well, yeah, as I, as I mentioned, like my original job assignment, I think that I had written like 25 or 30 filters for Oh, okay. Nato. And my initial job assignment was like, take the filters that you've already written and, you know, port them over to this new system. And, so I did that. I think that took like, you know, a week and I was like, well, is is there anything else I can do? And, at <span style="color:red" data-ts="1890.885" data-end_ts="1891.085" title="1890.885" id=c_"1890.885">__that__</span>, at that point, my, you know, I had learned to program a slightly bit, a little bit more, effectively. And, I started taking over, a bunch of the, like the basic movie playback, stuff adding, I think the, the original version had basic simple, playback with control. It might've had a sequence grabber, to use a camera. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeremy: </b>It might've had a way to record the disc. But anyway, I basically took over the QuickTime development and, built all those objects out, to the point where they were basically, able to reproduce, most of what you could do inside of the QuickTime app, and, do some rudimentary editing out of Max. So, that probably got a lot bigger. And in terms of the shocking amount of work done in a shocking short amount of time, we just didn't sleep very much. <laugh>, I think <laugh>, I remember at the, at the time, I would really sit on my couch for 12 hours at a time and just like, crank out code, like, like crazy, you know, I was also 25 years old. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1974.225" data-end_ts="1974.445" title="1974.225" id=c_"1974.225">__So__</span> it was a little bit easier to <span style="color:red" data-ts="1976.875" data-end_ts="1977.165" title="1976.875" id=c_"1976.875">__find__</span> the time and find the energy to, to do that. You know, just sort of like drink coffee until coffee doesn't help anymore. Right. And then go to bed for a few hours and start over. Yeah. So my principal contribution was in addition to the, the like pixel, or a lot of the pixel processing filters <span style="color:red" data-ts="1996.145" data-end_ts="1996.365" title="1996.145" id=c_"1996.145">__was__</span> then the QuickTime architecture. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, right. Let's, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2000.525" data-end_ts="2000.885" title="2000.525" id=c_"2000.525">__because__</span> I'm already burning through time. This is ridiculous. I, I have, I I have about hours of, well, no, I have hours more stuff I'd like to ask you about, but I want, I want <span style="color:red" data-ts="2011.085" data-end_ts="2011.245" title="2011.085" id=c_"2011.085">__to__</span> talk about something particular to your interests now, which is chess. And I'm, I'm having, I have to admit, maybe I can understand coming from like the programming thing, but your background wasn't heavy duty programming. It was more music and art. How does that translate into a guy who becomes obsessed with chess? 'cause if I recall last time we talked, you were like, you would go like on chess trips and stuff like that. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeremy: </b>I don't think I've ever taken a chess trip. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeremy: </b>I thought that you never, never, never say never. I mean, you can buy all inclusive, chess vacation packages and go to some sort of like, take a chess cruise. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Chess cruise. That's what I was thinking. <laugh> <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeremy: </b>But no, I, I have not sunk so deep yet. Okay. So yeah, I mean, I have essentially an obsessive personality. I tend to work in these sort of, bursts of frenetic activity, punctuated by long periods of not getting much done. Anyway, that's, like my obsession with working with video was, was one of these, my obsession with, working on certain kinds of, of music is, is another one. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2089.875" data-end_ts="2090.165" title="2089.875" id=c_"2089.875">__Then__</span> I moved to Berlin in 2004. And so, I was then for, several years obs obsessed with learning German. And after, I got good enough at that, I needed of course a new obsession. And, I was reading a book by sort of bad that I don't remember who the author was. It was either a Stanislav <span style="color:red" data-ts="2111.525" data-end_ts="2111.685" title="2111.525" id=c_"2111.525">__le__</span> book or it was by the Ky Brothers, the guys who wrote, roadside Picnic. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeremy: </b>Anyway, in one of these books, there was this, it was basically an East block author, and there was this hallucinogenic scene in the middle of this science fiction novel, which was all a huge chess metaphor. And I didn't understand any of it. And I was like, okay, well I guess I have to learn enough chess to understand what these last 30 pages were just about. Okay. And that's kind of how it got started. And it got a little bit out of hand <laugh>, that was about six or seven years ago. And, I'll put it right out there. I'm still not very good, but I'm a lot <laugh>, I'm a lot better than I was back then. I'm not sure putting my 10,000 hours yet. I hope not, because if this is the best thing I'm gonna get <laugh>. That's a little bit depressing. Right, I hear you. But I started from, yeah, I knew the rules when I was a kid, but nobody in my family played chess. And I always found the, the pieces really beautiful. We had like battle chess where the pieces would, would kill each other with swords, right. On the, like <laugh> on your old, on your 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>VGA computer or whatever. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeremy: </b>But I had never played seriously. And, and so I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2189.365" data-end_ts="2189.605" title="2189.365" id=c_"2189.365">__actually__</span> decided that I was gonna learn how to play chess. And so I went out and I got a book and I joined business <span style="color:red" data-ts="2195.965" data-end_ts="2196.165" title="2195.965" id=c_"2195.965">__if__</span> I think I joined five online chess communities on the first day. And I was like, okay, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2200.945" data-end_ts="2201.165" title="2200.945" id=c_"2200.945">__I'm__</span> gonna start, start playing this game. I'm gonna start winning and gonna start making some money here. And, well that didn't really work out quickly got my ass handed to me in, serious portions and realized that this was actually a really, really deep and really hard subject. Yeah. And I still spend a lot of time doing this. I've got a trainer, he's a neurologist from Romania, and I meet him once a week on a chess platform. And we go over my games from the previous week, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2230.805" data-end_ts="2230.925" title="2230.805" id=c_"2230.805">__I__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2230.955" data-end_ts="2231.245" title="2230.955" id=c_"2230.955">__mind__</span> gonna be playing in a tournament, where I'm seated number 201 out of 250 participants. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeremy: </b>So I'm sort of like the best of these, or maybe the worst of the mediocre <laugh>. I'm satisfied sort of with that as long as I see that I'm making progress. Right. I'm the, the captain of my chess works like a sport. I mean, no matter how whe whether you think of chess <span style="color:red" data-ts="2256.205" data-end_ts="2256.405" title="2256.205" id=c_"2256.205">__as__</span> sport or not, it kind of works like that. And they're these, playing leagues. So if you think like the, like the top football leagues, like Byron mentioned, for instance, in, in soccer is essentially a football club. So I'm also in one of these, sport clubs for chess. They've got like teams that play in the world, like the, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2279.645" data-end_ts="2279.845" title="2279.645" id=c_"2279.645">__chess__</span> Olympics and stuff like that. And I'm like the captain of the, the lowest team in the <laugh> in the chess club. So, you know, I'm, you know, I'm really making my way in the chess world. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeremy: </b>Anyway, it's a very interesting, it's a very interesting topic. It's the sort of thing, like, I try to explain stuff to my wife and she's just like, she starts yawning and immediately, right. You can't, you can't talk to me about this <laugh>. This is something I'm not very interested in. <laugh>. You know, I, I think I've managed to keep a good, life chess balance <laugh> right. So far. Chess has bled over a little bit into my, my job life. I wrote an object for Max that allows you to host chess engines. And it has a nice interface so you can let chess computer programs play against each other and see that in <span style="color:red" data-ts="2329.345" data-end_ts="2329.565" title="2329.345" id=c_"2329.345">__max__</span> and get all kinds of numerical data, these chess engines and use it to control your air conditioning, right, right. Home or whatever it is <span style="color:red" data-ts="2338.005" data-end_ts="2338.205" title="2338.005" id=c_"2338.005">__to__</span> use max for. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeremy: </b>So that's, that's sort of been fun. But in general, it's sort of a way to blow off steam in addition to being obsessive, fairly aggressive. And so it's sort of nice to have a, a non-violent, what's the word I'm <span style="color:red" data-ts="2353.845" data-end_ts="2353.965" title="2353.845" id=c_"2353.845">__want__</span>, I'm looking for in addition to, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2355.225" data-end_ts="2355.445" title="2355.225" id=c_"2355.225">__oh__</span>, moving to Germany. I've become a non-native speaker in any language. <laugh>. It's kind of amazing <laugh>. I used to be able, I used to have extremely good grammar in English at this point. I speak like a, an eight year old in both languages. Right. It's a little bit frustrating. Anyway, the, so yeah, I have an outlet from my aggression, where I get to keep the living shit out of the, the guy sitting across from me on the board and watch him sweat. Chess players are unbelievable sweaters, <laugh>. And, especially when they're losing, and it's not this kind of like I'm losing, but I'm exerting myself kind of like sports sweat, where it's sort of like you smell smells. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2400.925" data-end_ts="2401.125" title="2400.925" id=c_"2400.925">__Like__</span> if you go into a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2401.925" data-end_ts="2402.165" title="2401.925" id=c_"2401.925">__chess__</span> hall, like half the people smell like onions and the other half smell like nervous sweat. Oh my goodness. And, it's a real incredible, it's a really incredible scene. My wife came to pick me up from, one of these tournaments one day, and she walked in and she kind of turned green and had to <laugh> <laugh> had to go back out, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Had to bug out. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeremy: </b>It's sort of like, I'll wait for you outside. Wow. It's a very special environment, but, you know, I'm not ashamed. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>There you go. Well, Jeremy, I wanna thank you for a great conversation. That was, that was awesome. And like I said, I wish I had another couple of hours because there's a bunch more stuff I'd love to talk about. But, that was a lot of great stuff. One last question, that I like to ask people sometime. If you were to meet a 20 year old version of yourself, what advice or anti advice would you give somebody like that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeremy: </b>I would probably tell my 20 year old self, don't quit your day job <laugh>. I think <span style="color:red" data-ts="2465.885" data-end_ts="2466.045" title="2465.885" id=c_"2465.885">__if__</span> I had kept my, my screwdriver jockey job and kept making music in the evenings, I would've had a very different, I mean, I'm not saying it would've been a better life, but it would've been a, it would've been a, a much different life than I ended up having. I think that becoming a programmer changed the way I see the world changed the way I interact with computers in an, in an essential way. It changed the way I interact with other people's software and my own software as a creative person in an essential way because I no longer see bugs as problems to work around. I think that that has, I think that has negative repercussions, right? My, on my ability personally as a creative, as a creative person. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeremy: </b>Right. And so I tend, I kind of wish in certain ways that I'd remained a, a dumb musician, a naive user. On the other hand, you know, it's sort of like, I think I got to be a programmer or learning to be a programmer in an interesting field at a very interesting time. Yeah. And I'm super, I'm really happy to experience that. It's fascinating right now to see how there's this trend back into hardware. Yep. Which, you know, I'm also getting a bit into as well. I, due to my self-knowledge that I am obsessive, I am not going to buy a eurorack anything <laugh> because I'll then want all of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2555.325" data-end_ts="2555.445" title="2555.325" id=c_"2555.325">__it__</span>. Yes. But, but playing with hardware makes it's more cool. It's so much more satisfying and in many ways than than programming oscillators and right. Doing hookups and software. Anyway, the, I guess if, if my 20 year old self <span style="color:red" data-ts="2571.885" data-end_ts="2572.125" title="2571.885" id=c_"2571.885">__heard__</span> me rambling and raving like this, he would probably be like, dude, I'm not gonna do what you did. But the, in, in any case, I think, keep your head clear, <laugh> <laugh>, find time every day to do something you find boring because, that's, that's when good thinking happens, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Well, thank you so much. I really appreciate it. And have a great day, man. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeremy: </b>Hey, you too. Have a nice, have a nice time on top of the mountain. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'll do it. All right, bye. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2601.145" data-end_ts="2601.365" title="2601.145" id=c_"2601.145">__Yep__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeremy: </b>Bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And there you have in another great chat with a really smart person. It's really interesting that chess came up. Chad's been hopping up in my life a lot lately. My friend Mark Moser's been talking about it a lot. It's been very influential to him. He turned me on to the old Microsoft Press books about learning winning chess, which I've just started reading, but it's all about kind of the strategy behind, serious chess playing, which is really interesting. And, I am sure I'm just never gonna take it on because I'm not sure I want to be a beginner in something. Again, it sounds like hard work, but nevertheless, I want to thank Jeremy a lot for spending time talking about it and talking to us. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2650.425" data-end_ts="2650.845" title="2650.425" id=c_"2650.425">__Thanks__</span> to you for listening. Please, if you have any ideas for, for people to interview or if you'd like to be interviewed yourself, please drop me a line DDG at cycling <span style="color:red" data-ts="2662.485" data-end_ts="2662.965" title="2662.485" id=c_"2662.485">__74__</span>.
