      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Okay today, I have the great honor to be able to talk to someone who I've, whose work I've been following for quite a while. I actually saw him perform one time and was blown away. And ever since then, I have wanted to talk to him, but
        always have been a little intimidated. And so this is a really great opportunity. We got connected from a PR firm and, and which is good because that kind of like really ease the transition and made it easy for me to get kicked off on this.
        And so with that, I'm going to shut up and we are going to talk to Tim Exile Hey Tim, how's it going? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tim Exile: </b>
      Well, Darwin, well, well actually I think it's the mutual. I was also a bit intimidated. I mean, I've been following your podcast for, for a long time now. I'm a regular listener. So I was always a bit like, nah, I don't, I couldn't, I couldn't
      bring it upon myself to reach out to you directly and say, Hey, we really nice to speak to you. So anyway, here we are. So it's great that we get to speak. Thank you. Yeah,
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Here we are. In fact, well, this is really phenomenal and I know that one of the reasons we're going to talk though is, is specifically about an effort that you've got going right now, which is a software system called the endless package.
        Could you tell, could you talk a little bit about that? I mean, I think that's why we're talking, but it's, but it's also, clearly I've done a little research on it and it's clearly sort of like, it's, it's more than a software package. It
        looks a little bit like maybe your passion gig too. So I'd like to hear a little bit about what you've got going there. Yeah. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tim: </b>
      I mean, to some extent it's almost, it's almost world. I mean, I think the, the core endless community <span style="color:red" data-ts="102.62" data-end_ts="103.19" title="102.62" id=c_"102.62">__woods__</span> might describe it as something
      like that. And, it definitely feels like that when you go on our discord server and you see what the community are doing on, on endless, endless is a alive collaborative music creation platform. We have an iOS app that we launched in the app
      store just over a year ago, and we have a macro attack, which launched just before Christmas last year. And the windows version is coming very soon. It is, it's definitely an extension of my life's work. I have always been passionate about the
      idea of music as something we do rather than a product we can see. And that's definitely in the DNA DNA of endless. I mean, there's in the, to take the macro view, we're definitely trying something quite ambitious, which is really to, to return
      the, the idea of music as an activity we'll do together to get the consciousness, I suppose.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tim: </b>
      And that, you know, that idea is, has gained a lot of currency recently with the beginning of, you know, dollars jamming, <span style="color:red" data-ts="169.25" data-end_ts="169.91" title="169.25" id=c_"169.25">__modular__</span>
      performances. You know, when I started in improvising, probably the best part of two decades ago in providing electronic music was beyond niche. And very few people even knew that it was actually possible because at the time electronic music
      was all about designing sounds, laying them out in a, in a pattern with blocks on the screen, in a door or a secret, and then hitting space bar and seeing what it actually sounds like. The idea of it being performative was not really around 20
      years ago. And now it is which, which I think is wonderful. And we're moving into a world where creativity is something is becoming something that we do in real time to get there. I mean, there's a lot of big platforms recently, like
      multiplayer games, like Fortnite live streaming platforms like Twitch.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tim: </b>
      Most recently, we've had this real time social audio platform clubhouse, and it feels like this is where creativity is is going. So in that in the 20th century, we used to value creativity as a, as a means to an end, to produce content, which
      would be picked up on millions of desks, distributed, worldwide, and sold a huge profit. So it was all about creating content and building attention. Whereas I think where we're going now is people are becoming <span style="color:red"
        data-ts="252.64" data-end_ts="252.97" title="252.64" id=c_"252.64">__known__</span> not necessarily for what they have done, but what they can do. You know, when you follow someone's YouTube channel, you obviously you enjoy the content that
      you produce, but you get to know them as a person and you get to look forward to the next thing that's going to come out and that's becoming more and more real time. And so this is the Melbourne emphasis going into, I apologize. I went right up
      to the macro layers, so I'll, I'll, I'll put them out. I'll leave the mic there.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>No, that's really cool though, because it does kind of like lay down the gauntlet of what you're, what you're talking about. And, and it's actually interesting to think about, about our perceptions of, our perceptions of the value of
        performance. Changing performance is no longer something that's captured, encapsulated <span style="color:red" data-ts="302.82" data-end_ts="303" title="302.82" id=c_"302.82">__and__</span> product, and then shipped out for profit. Instead,
        the performance is the thing that's, that's treasured, it's a thing that people want to experience. And it's that experience in that, that sharing that actually is kind of gaining a lot of, a lot of value. Now it's interesting to me that you
        came out with a highly collaborative product, right, right. At a time when people were stuck in their basements, like trying to figure out how to even connect with their friends. I, I imagine that there, there actually was to a certain extent
        it helped with a problem that needed a solution, right? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tim: </b>
      Yeah. It was, it was definitely weirdly timely that we, we launched where we launched the mobile app on the 31st of March, 2020. And the world had literally just, just gone into the entire world was in lockdown. And yeah, we got a ton of press.
      We got a huge influx of, of users onto the platform. And, it was, it was one, it was, I mean, you can't say it was a good thing. Cause honestly it was a terrible thing. We were in the middle of a pandemic. But there was something a little bit
      magical I say about, about the timing. And then we were right in the middle, there was just so much experimentation. People were to some extent, it felt like people were actually fascinated by this new normal, and you know, the, the, the tone
      with which you communicate with people would change every day as people got their head around things. And everybody, you know, I remember trying to get a live streaming cameras and one week I got managed to get a logic Logitech <span
        style="color:red" data-ts="408.8" data-end_ts="409.22" title="408.8" id=c_"408.8">__video__</span>. No problem at all. And next week I wanted to get another one and you could, you couldn't find one anywhere. So everybody was experimenting
      with live streaming and it just felt there was this, this real sense of wanting to come together and specifically, because we couldn't come together. So, so yeah, it was weirdly, weirdly magical, you know, obviously, horrific, you
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Know? Right. Yeah. I, I
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Don't think we have to talk about how terrible it was, but I do think it's interesting that humanity and especially those of us who are artists had to find a way because it's the one thing that I think is really clearly a, a tenant of
        artistry is that you don't do it just because it's convenient. But a lot of times it's incredibly inconvenient to be an artist. I think it would be a lot better to be like a Hindu hedge fund manager and almost any turn. Right. But the fact of
        the matter is you do it because you need to do it. And you were there at a transition when people needed to still express themselves artistically and found a lot of the avenues kind of sealed up. I'm going to want to come back to this because
        I have a ton of questions related to this already. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>But before we do that, one of the things that I like doing in my podcast is talking to people about how they got to be the artists and the makers and in this kind of stuff in you are fascinating to me because, like I said, I, I got a chance
        to experience your art in action. It was, it blew me away. I have always appreciated the things that you've put on video. Some, some of the things you did were, so inspiring to me and I think to a lot of people, but you've also have, have
        this history of working with native instruments on doing different kinds of instrument, development, you know, putting together this live show stuff. But now you're in a, you know, you're in full on software development mode too. And I'm
        wondering where a person comes from that is able to develop the musical tastes and the musical vision that you have, but also the technology savvy, technological savvy, and capability that you're bringing as well. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tim: </b>
      Hmm. Yeah. Well, I mean, I, I've got a fairly well story that I trot out on it. I know that the end of this community of sort of bore them to tears. Yeah.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Right. So something maybe a little different than the pat answer, right? Yeah, yeah, </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tim: </b>
      Yeah. But I mean the key, you know, the key, the key points, still hold, so I'll hang a bit of a deeper dive off the key points. But you know, when I was four years old, I picked up the vibe in, I started doing the violin. Apparently my mum
      tells me it's the first thing that I actually said yes to. I was a pretty kind of uncooperative kid. And, and then, you know, I, I wanted, what I loved about the violin was it was so embodied. I put my bone with bring, move. My body music
      happens. I stopped moving my body, the music stops. So I think that that first musical experience has really set the frame for, for everything else that I've done. That's how I understand music primarily is something that happens when it's
      being done rather than is consumed once it's been recorded and distributed.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tim: </b>
      And, you know, I was, I was definitely, again, you know, my mum tells me that I used to just sit, we had this house in the Cotswolds right in the middle of the countryside, and we had this, little B road running past the front door. And
      apparently I'd just watched cars go past and get fascinated by the sound, you know, the Doppler shift as they go past. And as, as they sort of go up through the valleys, you could hear, you know, it's one of my, strongest memories is like the
      phase shifting that happens when, when cars moved through the valley that I grew up in, I think there was, there was always some kind of fascination with Tamra and sound. And I suppose, well, before, I mean, this is going <span
        style="color:red" data-ts="658.67" data-end_ts="658.76" title="658.67" id=c_"658.67">__in__</span> really go really deep, but I had a couple of near death experiences, one of the very, very young like pre, and it actually took me, I'd say no,
      a few years of therapy in my, in my late twenties before I actually figured out how significant this was.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tim: </b>
      And then I did a bit of research on the effect that, that has on young children and how, how it affects their development. And one of the key markers <span style="color:red" data-ts="684.44" data-end_ts="684.62" title="684.44"
        id=c_"684.44">__there's__</span> pre-verbal kids who've had near death experiences is, being fascinated with music, being fascinated with math. Yeah, so, you know, it, it describing when I started reading the books that researched this, I was
      just like, oh my God, that is exactly that's me, Dan Patea, there's a whole bunch of other stuff. And so I think that mixed with that first musical experience basically frames everything has the, either I've done or has happened to me, I've
      sort of into, at least being led into, through my curiosity. Yeah. You know, picked up the violin when I was four years old. I think I got fed up with it quite quick because it's just very, very hard.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tim: </b>
      I wanted to be able to express myself very quickly. I wanted to learn, but you know, it takes years to make decent sound on the violin and you have to practice once a week to keep it up, sorry, once a day, to keep it up, you know, a week off
      and you really lose <span style="color:red" data-ts="738.63" data-end_ts="738.72" title="738.63" id=c_"738.63">__it's__</span> that dexterity. So yeah, when I, when I was in Asia, a friend lent me this bootleg rave tape, and I think I listened
      to it two or three hours a night, every night for, for like a couple of months. And it, it was just, it was utterly mind blowing. I had no idea what was going on. I was 12 years old and of course my frame of reference, <span style="color:red"
        data-ts="759.45" data-end_ts="759.5" title="759.45" id=c_"759.45">__it__</span> was embodied music making. So I thought music was being played by people somehow with these crazy machines.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tim: </b>
      And then, you know, once I started to research how rave music was made and play <span style="color:red" data-ts="772.11" data-end_ts="772.35" title="772.11" id=c_"772.11">__lead__</span> and what raves, where I was just like, oh, okay, this is
      actually music. That's made the studios and vinyl and mixed by DJs, which I think I was probably a little bit disappointed, but anyway, I told myself the DJ got some decks. I didn't find them in fun enough though. I went to Andy, which is a
      kind of electronic shop, bought a bunch of components, like extra potentiometers and switches. So I can make the go backwards and go from, you know, from zero to a hundred percent and stuff like that. And then of course they broke, of course.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tim: </b>
      And then I started messing around in the, the recording studio at school and we had a reel-to-reel tape machine and a really big mixing desk and some old scent. And I just, I, yeah, I just kind of hack and dub mix music. And I was trying to
      make, I was trying to make sort of house and break beat techno hardcore jungle stuff by playing drum beats in and recording them an eight track. I mean, it was, it was lunacy. And then I saved up for a sampler and started to started to actually
      get into the, you know, quote unquote proper way to produce the music at the time with a sampler and an <span style="color:red" data-ts="849.93" data-end_ts="850.25" title="849.93" id=c_"849.93">__RX__</span> sequencer. And that sort of laid
      the foundation is for me actually participating in the music industry that was going on at the, at the time, you know, making records, releasing them hounding record label owners to release my music, et cetera, and being a, you know, being a
      sort of Daimler generals of low level pain.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Right, right. That's how you get started. Right. Well, exactly. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tim: </b>
      That is, that is. Yeah. But I think it was always, I never, I never felt when I was making records that, that I, I was really in the right skin. I think, you know, the curiosity I remember it was like around the late nineties and I got my first
      PC and I, I would spend, you know, I don't know, actually it <span style="color:red" data-ts="894.53" data-end_ts="894.62" title="894.53" id=c_"894.53">__was__</span> my mom's computer <span style="color:red" data-ts="895.31"
        data-end_ts="895.4" title="895.31" id=c_"895.31">__on__</span> dial up through modem. We had an, a house and my parents' house, and, I'd search for these weird esoteric VST, plugins, and ways to process sounds. And they never lived up to what
      I wanted them to be. So I just started messing around with coding, well, not coding. It was all node based, stuff like that.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>You really got into the sync monitor, which became generator, which became Reaktor. Right. Exactly. Yeah. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tim: </b>
      Yeah. I dived into pure data a bit, but, at the time I think, cause it was fairly early and it was fairly open source. There were quite a few modules. It didn't work properly. So I like, I built an entire system in <span style="color:red"
        data-ts="939.52" data-end_ts="939.73" title="939.52" id=c_"939.52">__and__</span> data, but I couldn't actually get it to work properly. So yeah, I mean the, the, the rabbit, the rabbit hole that I really fell down was, was Reaktor and to
      some extent, I mean, I'm, I'm still partially in that rabbit hole, you know, there's even, even this year or a couple of weekends, I've been doing some creative coding projects in, in Reaktor. Yeah. That's a sort of relatively deep dive into
      the background.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>So it's interesting to me that though that, the, the skin of the typical rec record producer didn't feel right. And that Reaktor sink modular to Reaktor that, that framing did. What was it about coding specifically that's scratched an itch
        for you that, that you couldn't have gotten from getting, say a modular synth or like diving down the hole of something like, you know, at the time the Nord modular was floating around, so you probably could have bought something like that
        and something that was more a traditional musical instrument. I mean, Reaktor, it's music focused, but it's by no means a traditional musical instrument in any way, shape or form. Right. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tim: </b>
      Yeah. I don't think there's any things specifically about coding that got me into coding or programming. I still feel a little bit like a Charlotte's in coding <span style="color:red" data-ts="1024.15" data-end_ts="1024.24" title="1024.15"
        id=c_"1024.15">__it__</span> coding, because it was essentially worrying about boxes and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1027.33" data-end_ts="1027.6" title="1027.33" id=c_"1027.33">__worse__</span>, but, but it is, yeah, it wasn't, it
      wasn't that I wanted to program things. It's just, I had a very clear idea of the things that I wanted to do, and none of the stuff out that I did, what I wanted to do. And I think specifically I was really interested within the potential of
      taking off the shelf, MIDI controllers, particularly, you know, the parents <span style="color:red" data-ts="1049.14" data-end_ts="1049.22" title="1049.14" id=c_"1049.14">__of__</span> the ones from the BCR 2000 <span style="color:red"
        data-ts="1051.72" data-end_ts="1052.17" title="1051.72" id=c_"1051.72">__VCF__</span>. Just, I mean, obviously it's, it's a shame what's happened recently. But let's, let's let that slide. But the, you know, those, those products were
      incredibly forward-thinking and, you know, quite honestly, I still think that what they, the opportunity that they offered then has never really been taken up, I would say because they, they were so programmable that they were, I mean, <span
        style="color:red" data-ts="1082.58" data-end_ts="1082.73" title="1082.58" id=c_"1082.58">__they're__</span> designed, they were basically designed exactly for someone like me.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tim: </b>
      And, you know, I wanted to make a very physical, very haptic instrument that had a really deep, really tight integration with software where you, you don't feel like you or <span style="color:red" data-ts="1100.7" data-end_ts="1100.91"
        title="1100.7" id=c_"1100.7">__where__</span> you interact with the screen. So the, the flow machine in Reaktor for these interfaces, there is no interact when I'm playing <span style="color:red" data-ts="1109.25" data-end_ts="1109.52"
        title="1109.25" id=c_"1109.25">__live__</span>. There <span style="color:red" data-ts="1109.67" data-end_ts="1109.76" title="1109.67" id=c_"1109.67">__was__</span> zero interaction with the mouse and the screen whatsoever, the screen, there's
      a few things need to be represented on the screen. But you know, most of it is just motorized faders bank switching and performing, and that's, that was what I wanted to do because that, that was essentially bringing, bringing that framing of
      the violin. When I was a kid into the world of electronics, it had to be, you know, physical haptic interface first. And, and that was the end way to do it really. I, and I, you know, I, yeah, Reaktor was a work by, by, by the time I chose
      Reaktor, there were a few wormholes, I could have fallen down <span style="color:red" data-ts="1155.04" data-end_ts="1155.36" title="1155.04" id=c_"1155.04">__corn__</span> down the maximum hole.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tim: </b>
      I could have fallen down further down the pure wormhole, but I think at the time, I mean at the time, and still now, actually I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll just come out with my allegiance to react to a native instruments, in terms of, you know,
      creating really quality DSP with quality interaction, with very capable data handling and ability to sort of build frameworks within it. I mean, Reaktor is super powerful. And, the, some stage, all of the endless, divert team has told me that I
      should really just start building stuff in C plus plus given what I tried to get Reaktor today.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Well, yeah, but the other side of it is, these node-based systems and Reaktor, I would say is primary among them. it's a kind of high-level, you know, so you can, you can deal with a filter without having to think about coefficients and
        multiple cations and feedback and all this other horse shit. You can, you can think of a filter as a filter and really engage with it as a part of an instrument build with, without though having to be like, oh, here's a premium thing that I
        don't have any effect on. I think Reaktor does a really good job of being right in the middle of those spaces. And it makes a lot of sense that someone with your, your kind of focus would, would really gravitate towards that. Now I'm curious,
        do you, what's the first thing that you programmed as a Reaktor patch? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tim: </b>
      Yeah, it was, I'm not quite sure because, my first, the first thing I programmed with a node-based digital modular was in sync modular, and I'm pretty sure it was a delay effect because at the time you couldn't load samples into sync module. I
      was very kid. I wanted to mess around with samples. Right. That's where it's been. That's always been my thing that I've always gravitated that, not quite sure why, but so the first thing I built on the sync <span style="color:red"

      And actually, I think that there's a, there's a track one of my first ever 12 inches on, I know it was an EAP wasn't <span style="color:red" data-ts="1296.33" data-end_ts="1296.45" title="1296.33" id=c_"1296.33">__the__</span> <span

      They did this limited series called the MSX series, and there's a track called bad diet, which is just crazy. Amen. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1307.53" data-end_ts="1307.61" title="1307.53" id=c_"1307.53">__And__</span> mashup. I mean,
      the actual production of it is terrible. I mean, I literally smacked every trans <span style="color:red" data-ts="1313.82" data-end_ts="1314.09" title="1313.82" id=c_"1313.82">__diem__</span> in the AME to break out of there. So it's just like,
      instead of like really crisp it's like anyway, but I did use, I did use that little, intimate to produce these kinds of little twist ups at the end. Those came from that was the first ever thing that I programmed in a digital modular.

      <i>That's, that's really interesting now, but that does actually kind of point to something else that's important here, because when you talk about kind of the timeframe of your musical development, you came to and discarded, deejaying, you
        went into production with samplers and, and all that kind of stuff in kind of a traditional way using computers. I know from watching some of your, videos and reading some of your story, you kind of went the whole route of like, I'm going to
        learn a sequencer, I'm going to learn pro tools and we'll learn these things, right. You kind of followed that traditional path, but then you got into this node based programming, but there's another part of it, which is you also got
        fascinated with looping and you talk about being fascinated with samples, but I would say that it's not samples in what is thought of in the traditional way. </i>

        And now I'm going to play a snare drum kind of thing. You treat it like it's a way of capturing live sound and manipulating live sound. It's really, it is this kind of like mishmash between looping and sampling where you're, you're doing
        sample type manipulation, but it's always with live content or that's the way it feels to me. It seems like your music has been based off of live audio capture. I mean, is that fair enough to say </i>

    <p>
      <b>Tim: </b>
      A hundred percent? Yeah, absolutely. And, and, and I think, you know, it's one of these mysteries that, that I, I think I keep on discovering more about why I got into, into live sampling. And I think it's most, it all comes back to this idea
      of being spontaneous and somehow dialoguing, somehow music creation as being, a dialogue, at least between you and the equipment that your, that you <span style="color:red" data-ts="1456.54" data-end_ts="1456.66" title="1456.54"
        id=c_"1456.54">__you're__</span> using. And then obviously in the case of vendors, which is, which now takes that workflow and makes it collaborative. It's, you're actually in dialogue with other, other people who have the same tech stack at
      the center of their kind of instrumental experience, I guess it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1470.35" data-end_ts="1470.63" title="1470.35" id=c_"1470.35">__this__</span> sort of shared instrumental experience. What I really like about
      live sampling and particularly then manipulate it, manipulating those live samples is, is that you really, it's really conversational the way you, the way you create.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tim: </b>
      So, you know, I'll lay something down and then the way that turns out is never quite, it's not, not what you intended it to be, but it's also something that will surprise you. You have an idea about a thing you want to do, you do the thing, and
      then it comes back at you and it's just like, oh yeah, no, that is that's is kind of what I intended, but it's also different from what I intended and it sparks something else. And for, for me, well, that really is the magic of creativity. And
      it's also the magic of collaboration, you know, where you and I are in a conversation right now. And every time either speaks, it sparked or something else in the other person. And so it goes back and forth. And I think for me, it's, it's that
      interaction, this sort of almost the, the improvisational.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tim: </b>
      Yes. And, but, when a statement is made or some kind of creative act is performed, there's always a space after that to then perform another creative act or reply or do something to the artifact that was created in the first instance. But the
      more I, the more I dig into understanding that, and the more I dig into, I get building technology allows musicians to do that together, remotely from around the world. The more I realized that this is actually about relationship building and
      possibly even community building it's this conversation that says, this is why I'm really interested in this new world. We're moving into where, where things, where we're focusing on skills rather than just content, because, you know, content
      is an end point. It's just made this piece of music go away into this piece of music. And there's nothing really to respond to. I mean, people do respond to it or write reviews, or, there were plants, friends or whatever, but generally <span

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Well, I think, I think you're onto something there because, and I would see this, one of the things that, you know, when we moved from, and I would say, even in, in terms of electronic music and dance music, Greg move, we moved from whether
        it was like a bunch of denouncing rolling boxes that we would kind of like tweak stuff or, or people, you know, on the other, on the other side of things, people who had modular systems that would just like turn knobs and make squealy songs,
        we started moving towards the computer. And what we started to do was two things. We, first of all, stripped out anything that wasn't, you know, part of our plan and secondly, build a lot of guardrails so that it was hard to make the
        mistakes. But one of the things you're talking about here is first of all, you sort of like celebrate the idea of making mistakes, because sometimes that can spur you into something new. And, and secondly, this idea that when you're in a
        conversation, things are going to happen that are, you know, outside of a plan. And that actually is sort of like a mechanism by which creativity, you know, a platform that you can launch creativity off of. Yeah, </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tim: </b>
      Absolutely. And I think that, you know, the whole idea of the, the mistake is, is a weird way of describing it because I think actually, what, what often happens is <span style="color:red" data-ts="1692.56" data-end_ts="1692.82" title="1692.56"
        id=c_"1692.56">__there__</span>, there's another bit in between, there's the idea of the mistake is that it's either exactly right. Or it's not, and it's wrong completely to identify it. It's completely wrong. You need to find out what's
      wrong. But, but I think quite often what you find happens is, very much this, this yes. And which <span style="color:red" data-ts="1710.87" data-end_ts="1710.98" title="1710.87" id=c_"1710.87">__have__</span> a friend, I've got a friend who's
      an improv comedian who, you told me about this idea that this is the key tenet behind comedy improv is it's always yes. And if you're improvising with someone, you never, you never shut anything down. You always say yes, that thing and
      something else, because I think there's always, when we get to the end of a certain creative act or a sentence, there is this period where we sort of, regard, regard what's being done and absorb what we've done.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tim: </b>
      And some things are revealed in that space, I think. And what's revealed in that space is all stuff that you didn't really think about when you were very intent on speaking those words or writing those notes or dialing in those effects or
      whatever. And when you step back, it's just like, oh yeah. More happening there in some cases that that was unintended. But in other cases it was just, it was more like, it was just out of scope of what I was thinking of at the time. And
      that's, that's that space in which magic happens, I think right

        try to encapsulate a lot of those ideas into this endless software. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>But I'm curious, first of all, about when you first started doing that, what gave you the indication that this collaborative effort, this conversation that you talk about was even a desirable thing. I mean, quite frankly, when you started
        working on these systems in this collaborative thing, I don't think that there were many people that thought of electronic music, whether it was experimental electronic music or dance music, or host production, nobody thought of that as a
        collaborative thing. Most people thought of it as something you'd do in your base rent, you know, while you're, you know, waiting to press your first <span style="color:red" data-ts="1907.28" data-end_ts="1907.76" title="1907.28"
          id=c_"1907.28">__disc__</span>. Right. How did you imagine this to be a collaborative process? And was it a surprise to you that anybody else was interested in? Or did you have any feeling like that? And of course that's what people want to
        do. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tim: </b>
      Yeah. I mean, there was a, there was a moment I think we started, so Ash, who's our lead developer lead engineer who has built a huge amount of the platform. We started working together on just some prototypes messing around and Reaktor
      actually in 2015, you know, the initial prototypes were just Reaktor patches. They were basically the flow machine. So Ash had a version of the flow machine and we were trying, adding extra features. Then what, you know, one of the, I think one
      of the most powerful features of endless is that you've got this riff history of every single thing that's ever happened in, in a jam. And you can track back through that history, right? To the very beginning of that jam, which is, it's a
      really, really powerful feature. It's very freeing because you can keep on moving forwards. You can always try stuff out and you know, you're not going to destroy anything.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tim: </b>
      It's a way it's going to be there for you to recall. So Ash and I were working together on this and he had his version of the flow machine. I had my version of the flow machine next to each other. He had his riff history of what he'd been
      working on. And he was kind of showing me some of the things he'd been doing. And I had my one as well. They were, they were all on Ableton push one. So we built this using the colored pads. We built the system browsing back through <span
        style="color:red" data-ts="2000.84" data-end_ts="2001.26" title="2000.84" id=c_"2000.84">__rips__</span> and he was paying back through his and I was playing back to Martin and I, I was just, I was just like, it would be really cool if we
      could actually have a shared one of these histories. And, that's how the, the idea of making it collaborative came about.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tim: </b>
      And since then, it just became quite, quite obvious that that was a very cool thing. You know, the first I remember the first time we had it working, I think it was maybe 2018 in late 2018, we got a version of the iOS app working with this
      shared history. And, and we, we staged a jam with five people at one person, a couple of in the UK, some of the U S and someone in Germany, it was spine tingling. It was absolute spine tingling. And it, I think that we, you know, we knew then
      that, that experience that basically we needed to focus on getting people to that experience as quickly as possible, because it is an utterly magical experience when your jamming together live with people from all over the world, you, you add a
      layer to what's going on. And 10 seconds later that layer comes back with some different effects or another layer on top of it. It really is conversational. I think that's something that humans innately desire because the most powerful thing
      about being in conversation is that you really get to be seen and understood, and you get to see and understand people and you get to do that sort of turns in, in a almost game-like way.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Yeah, no, it's, it's interesting. I watched some video of this in action and I actually, I'm having trouble imagining how some of this stuff works because you talk about this shared Griff history. And I saw things happening in video, or I
        didn't understand because it was different than any other collaborative system I've seen. Oftentimes what a collaborative system looks like is a shared clock system where people then have, you know, are doing something locally and the
        clocking is shared. But, but what I saw in the videos really did look like the somehow magically in the background was moving from device to device and was available on no matter what device you picked up or who is working with any device. Am
        I catching that correctly? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tim: </b>
      Yes. To do it, to do a quick, deep dive it's, it's one of these things that it was dangerous in a way to get getting into describing exactly how it works. Just, with the power of voice, because it's a bit, it benefits and diagrams, but
      basically it's, it's asynchronous. So it's actually built on a fork of the technology you to build Dropbox. So it's that you've got

    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tim: </b>
      Yeah, no, that's exactly it. So it's, it's basically brought box with a bunch of modifications. So everybody has their own transport and essentially as soon as you create something and commit it, that <span style="color:red" data-ts="2198.6"
        data-end_ts="2198.78" title="2198.6" id=c_"2198.6">__said__</span> it to everybody else in, in, in the jam, they will pick it up and we'll slot into their local transport wherever they are in pro in the program. So it's, it's a, it's a
      modular. Got it.

      Oh gosh. There's so much cool stuff that people do with it. I know that, I mean, he's done some really cool stuff with it. She has performed live. I think there was a big, expo somewhere in the middle east. And I can't remember what it was now,
      but they had a bunch of musicians on the stage and imaging Ms. Pike den via endless to, a light show in a physical concept, concert hall from her house, just outside London. That's really cool. I think that, you know, some of the live
      performances and live streams that we've done with endless, with, with the community, you know, state staging it directly on our Twitch platform, on our Twitch channel. Those have been very, those have been really exciting because we, we bring
      the camera feeds of people and we also, you know, we make it look pretty and, we stream the audio from ethical machine and it feels, it feels like an event.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tim: </b>
      I'd say generally the really exciting stuff has been staging. I'd say these kinds of operative using creation rituals. We did a bunch of experiment with NFS turning this <span style="color:red" data-ts="2309.45" data-end_ts="2309.75"
        title="2309.45" id=c_"2309.45">__wrist__</span> into NFTs. That was quite exciting just to be part of, part of that whole world, trying to understand it, trying to understand this crazy new technology and this crazy new marketplace and how
      people were using it. There's so much stuff that people are doing. Oh, really interesting. Another interesting thing that's happened recently, there's this really great app called <span style="color:red" data-ts="2330.38" data-end_ts="2331.07"
        title="2330.38" id=c_"2330.38">__***<inaudible>***__</span> M U B E R T. And they create these kind of generative pieces of music where they take a bunch of stems and then they, it's basically kind of like auto switching between them, but
      they create new sort of stations that you can listen to. And if quite a few people have taken in this <span style="color:red" data-ts="2350.15" data-end_ts="2350.51" title="2350.15" id=c_"2350.15">__jams__</span> and turn them into these Buba
      thing.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tim: </b>
      So yeah. Turning your jam into a, a generative piece of music. I think that's, that's also really interesting. And I think that's something in terms of where we're headed in, in terms of what we're building for endless. You know, the next big
      step for us is how to turn the media that people are creating on endless either as, as live performances into, into something that people would want to come and see or experience in real time. But also that the music that people have created in
      these jams, turning those into maybe more lean back experiences that people can go to someone's profile and then play through all the stuff they've created, et cetera.

        champs? Is this something that you, that you imagine as sort of an outgrowth of what's being developed? </i>

    <p>

      London. And we started at least on that beginning of March last year. I think we managed to run one event. So I think the, the potential of sort of mixed mixed reality, if you like events where we could have a few people in a real venue in one
      place and a few people in real venue, in a few other places around the world and stage live concerts, live jams linked up between multiple physical spaces. That's something I'm really excited about in the long run. I think, I think the great
      opening up is, is a big threat to end this because ultimately your own studio setup is not very portable and it is just, it's, it's quite a pain to do to organize it.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tim: </b>
      Even with someone just down the road to, you know, to find a space mean there's some stuff you have to do. You have to find the space, you have to put the space, you have to take your kid there. You have to disassemble it from your <span
        style="color:red" data-ts="2498.42" data-end_ts="2498.87" title="2498.42" id=c_"2498.42">__center__</span>, put it in a car or cab, move it somewhere else, set it up again. And it doesn't sound the way you sounds though. I think the ability
      to just plug in through a social network and find people who are online, this is in the next six months where we're really focusing on the social features behind end of this. So, so you can connect with people on the platform, which you can't
      do yet. You can discover people so you can get notifications when your friends are online, et cetera, all this kind of stuff. So I think the convenience and the kind of lack of friction that the end offers that, you know, we have, we have
      people collaborating from the U S and Canada and Sweden and France and the UK regularly. And to make that work by getting people into a physical space is pretty much impossible.

      <b>Tim: </b>
      W well, what's next for Endlesss is so we're currently fundraising. I'm not actually sure when this podcast is going out. So either we'll, we'll be just about launch a crowd equity campaign, or we'll be in the middle of it, or, but at the end
      of it, so, so that's happening. That's really, that's, that's very exciting because, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2585.47" data-end_ts="2585.62" title="2585.47" id=c_"2585.47">__it's__</span> going to give our community an opportunity to
      actually have a stake in the business that we're building as well, which I think is exactly how it should be. And then we, you know, we're raising this money to build out our social features, which is also very, very exciting. We, the app has
      been out there quite a bit now, and we know how people behave. We know that if it will actually form friendships around endless, they, they stick around for, for a long time and, and get a huge amount of value, but, you know, personal and
      creative value outfit.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tim: </b>
      So we were really excited about that. It doesn't mean artists. I mean, I, I don't really get that much time to work on, on music these days that said early this year, I did start building something that I, something I've been an idea I've been
      working with for a long time, which is it's actually an idea around composition having built an entire career on improvisation. It's basically using the idea of key framing in videos, in video editors, where you can take a snapshot of, all the
      settings and in take another snapshot with settings and more between multiple snapshots, I've been working on some systems and react to that, allow me to do that and also generate visuals at the same time. It's pretty embryonic at the moment.
      And I very rarely get any time to work a bit, but maybe after this off, we've got this funding round tied up. I might take a couple of days to work, work a bit more on that.
