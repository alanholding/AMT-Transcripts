<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. This week we have a special guest. He's a, he's one of these people that I've talked to in the past, but he also is a good friend of many of my friends. And so, it was really opportune for me to be able to talk to him. He's one of the most active people in, sort of the experimental music scene, at least, in the edge of it that I occupy. He's Dr. Jeff Kaiser It, he, he actually pointed out that, the doctor was appropriate, and I was happy to use it because I'm very glad for him to now have that moniker attached to his name. Jeff. Hi. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff Kaiser: </b>Hi. Yeah, doctor's. Much better than the former reverend. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>There you go. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Yeah. I like that <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Nice. So I, there are like a million things I, I, I'm going to want to talk to you about, but one of the things that I really <span style="color:red" data-ts="64.94" data-end_ts="65.26" title="64.94" id=c_"64.94">__enjoy__</span> doing in the podcast, and, and one of the things that really opens doors for me just in terms of knowing the person I'm talking to, is to ask for, a little recap of their history or, or what are the things that were, important to making them the person that they've become. So I'm gonna start off this, this chat with that. Tell me a little bit about where you come from and, and what were the influences that made you what you are? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Well, the, the path to the, this little, realm of experimental music that we occupy is, is, is kind of, you know, I don't know, it's a little bit obscure, but it's, a lot of people have come to it in several, similar ways, I think. I started out playing trumpet in the church and in school, and so, and doing youth symphonies, and stuff like that. And at the same time I was playing in punk rock bands, but, as a, I was pre-law at, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, and I was in the middle of final exams for, I think it was like Civil Li Liberties and Jurisprudence or something like that, my third year. And I woke up and I go, what the heck am I doing? <laugh>, <laugh>. It was, I just, I just felt I was gonna have a heart attack by the time I was 25 living like that, you know? And I just switched to music and I thought I was gonna be a gospel musician. I was a, I actually ran into and met Johnny Zell from the Lawrence Welk Orchestra who, when I was in that transition space, who was just like so stoked for me. He introduced me on stage at this big concert. And, and so I went to Westmont College, with, you know, pure plans on being a gospel trumpet player, musician. But along the way, there was a professor there named John <span style="color:red" data-ts="178.16" data-end_ts="178.58" title="178.16" id=c_"178.16">__Rapson__</span>. Do you know, know John? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I don't, no, no. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>He's now the head of a program in Iowa, at University of Iowa, the creative music, or creative, I forget what it's called, creative studies. But, he is a experimental trombone player who worked with a lot of people who are now my friends and collaborators. Vinny go Golia, Alex Klein, John Fumo. Right. A lot from the LA scene. And of course, I met Andrew PAs, our mutual friend through Vinnie Golia. So John had Elliot Schwartz, the experimental composer come to school, and he played some stuff. And, you know, I actually told him to his face. I thought it was bullshit. I mean, I, I said that, I said that exactly. I mean, here I am, you know, raised in a suburb and playing, gospel music and symphony, but I'm playing punk at the same time. But I thought that experimental stuff was crazy, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>And Elliott was so kind to me. And next thing I know, John's like handing me recordings of all sorts of experimental music, but really influential was, both electronic music that he was handing to me and, art Enseo Chicago and other music from the aac m, which just, just blew my mind. And all of a sudden, that's my life's direction, you know? I mean, it like happened quickly that I just switched. And I actually wrote Elliot a letter years later. I actually wrote, I used to publish a newsletter, and I wrote a little editorial about that, and somebody read it and sent it to Elliot, and the Elliot wrote to me, and we had a lovely email correspondence about it, or letter, actually letter correspondence about it. And he was really cool and glad to hear from me again and stuff. So. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that's, that's really amazing. I had no idea you had this hidden history in gospel music, you know, because if nothing else, I would say the music that you're doing right now is definitely not gospel music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b><laugh>. Yeah. It's, well, maybe it's somebody's gospel. Well, maybe not that gospel, that's for sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. So, what, what is the, what is the background that, that has that be a reality? I mean, was it that, it was a family thing that you went to church and that music was the part of the church that you sort of connected with? Or was it a convenient way to, you know, I, I'm curious about that as well, because that's certainly my story was that, I was, my family was in incredibly into, you know, heavily into the church thing, and the part of the church thing that I, that I could handle, and that, that spoke to me was like the music and, and the tech, the, audio technology and stuff that was, that was a thing that I could, I could do when I was involved in that. That made sense to me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Absolutely. I am actually so grateful. I am not a, not a person of faith, you know, anymore. But, that music, that I was raised with in my home and at the church is, was incredibly influential. And I, I think, you know, it still resonates with me. I still write for my big band. I'll write corrals for them. That'll appear in the middle of all the chaos that they do. Right. And, and I still like writing for choirs. It's one of my favorite things to write for if I'm actually composing. It was so important. And I, and there is literally nothing but respect in my heart for the music and the musicians I was, raised with. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, now, <laugh>, this is amazing. I, I didn't expect it to go here at all, but it's, it's really neat that it has. So as, as a trumpet player, you, you have a certain voice and a certain kind of ensemble you generally you'll work with, but I noticed when I was just kind of going over your, going over your bio. You've worked with vocal, vocal groups, something at Ojai, I think was was one of 'em, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>That's, correct. My master's degree is in conducting with, focus on Coral, conducting as well as, or orchestral. And that was also part of going into the church. But, in leaving that I've worked with, the Ojai Camarata was the name of the ensemble. Yeah, that's it. And it was so fun. I mean, I commissioned new works from the likes of Wayne, Pete, Vinnie Golia, <span style="color:red" data-ts="449.02" data-end_ts="449.38" title="449.02" id=c_"449.02">__Stewart__</span> Lee, <span style="color:red" data-ts="449.74" data-end_ts="449.94" title="449.74" id=c_"449.74">__big__</span> Jim Connolly. And then at the same time, I'd get to conduct, Palacer and, dun <span style="color:red" data-ts="456.25" data-end_ts="456.54" title="456.25" id=c_"456.25">__Bowl__</span> and <span style="color:red" data-ts="457" data-end_ts="457.42" title="457" id=c_"457">__Percel__</span>, and all this old stuff that I love. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's amazing. How did, how did the community take to those performances? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>The community loved those performances. They were really well received. At the time I had, you know, I was no longer involved with the church. Now there were performances that I did with my own quarrel ensembles that were, avant-garde, you know, experimental music performances while I was in the church, which were, possibly less well received by certain people, <laugh>, right. They're like, they call Pastor Jeff. You're doing that <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>But, I, I love the music. I love the tradition. I love the sound of human voices singing together, or, or solo. It's, it's just, it's great. In fact, I'm in discussions for <span style="color:red" data-ts="505.46" data-end_ts="505.58" title="505.46" id=c_"505.46">__a__</span> new commission. I have a meeting, next week for a commission for, new <span style="color:red" data-ts="510.34" data-end_ts="510.58" title="510.34" id=c_"510.34">__Coral__</span> work, which I think will involve some electronics. The same as, I wrote an oratorio called Answer to Job that was commissioned by, California Lutheran University. Yeah. Yes. A few years back. And, that involved a lot of electronics, a gigantic Max Patch with eight microphones going into a choir. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, my. That's gonna be a holler. I'm sure 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>It was, it was so fun when, yeah, when the whirlwind descends, you know, in the book of job, you can imagine what all the audio held that broke loose. It was wonderful <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Of all the things Max was probably perfectly created for. That sounds just about to be right down <span style="color:red" data-ts="549.64" data-end_ts="549.86" title="549.64" id=c_"549.64">__the__</span> center of it, you know? Oh, it's pretty rough when the center, when your center line comes from the book of job. Yeah. But there you go. I guess it'll have to work. Yeah. So, what was, what led to the Exodus away from doing, church and, and religious music? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Well, actually, Carl Jung, probably <laugh>, but <laugh> as much as anything, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Everyone blames him for everything. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b><laugh>, I love Carl Jung so much, but, you know, when I, when I, went to, went back to school, I, I left him behind for other writers, but he, you know, as much as anything. But it was, a slow realization that it was not the place for me. And, when I left it, I just dove into music full time. And, that became my thing. You know, I was fortunate to be able to do that, and, and it's been a blast ever since. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, no doubt. Well, now, I'm a little bit confused about, about the educational path, because you've got your doctorate, but I, in some cases, you're, you're, you know, you really self-describe as a performer. In other cases, you, and, and even just, you know, a couple of sentence ago, you, you self-describe as either a conductor or a band leader. You're la you know, you've done label, but you've also talked about yourself as an ethnomusicologist. Which of those represents like your educated reality? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>My educated 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Reality, your academic reality is what I should have 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Said, my academic reality. You know, I was fortunate enough to get my PhD recently, and I had a, you know, a hiatus between my, long hiatus between my masters and my, PhD where I was, you know, a professional musician. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> was my, main activity. Right. So I really embrace the idea of the artist scholar, in, in the, as the reality of who I am right now. It's very hard for me to think of them as distinct activities, though. You know, you definitely, you code switch when you're hanging out with musicians. You'll use one set of, you know, one language. And when you're hanging out with academics, you might switch to another language, certainly. <span style="color:red" data-ts="691.7" data-end_ts="691.82" title="691.7" id=c_"691.7">__Sure__</span>. You know, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, it seems like music schools are a little bit more embracing of that than others, I think, you know, or maybe I'm wrong. I mean, what's what's your feeling about that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>I think it seems to be a pretty recent phenomenon. I mean, the program I'm in, excuse me, I graduated from, was found by the wonderful, one of the founders was the wonderful artist scholar George Lewis. Right. And he's a, he's a big model. I mean, he's just, you know, really, embodies that though. I understand. I don't think he's playing, trombone anymore. I heard from somebody that said he's really focusing on writing in, his text and composing, but he was really influential. And of course, you know, then in the program, I graduated from David Borgo, who's written books and, you know, recorded albums. Right. Yeah. But there's definitely, I, so I like, I like that hybrid artist, scholar, you know? Sure. Moniker. But it's, you know, it's like there's not a single word for that right now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>There isn't. You're right. And in fact, I think sometimes, sometimes the, the kind of academics that can be described with a single word are either intimidated or just plain don't like people that are trying to push boundaries like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="773.44" data-end_ts="773.66" title="773.44" id=c_"773.44">__Oh__</span>, yeah. I mean, and you had a recent sojo journey into academia as well. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I was very late to the whole academic world, and, so I just recently got my master's and the way that that played out, I was, I took a very thoughtful approach, which was to go to a school that, embraced media arts as sort of a general case program, and also to make sure that the thing that I was interested in studying and pursuing was different than any of the other acquisitions there, so that I could kind of mark my own path rather than having to follow someone else's particular lead. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Nice. It 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Worked out very well for me. You know, I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Think that's, you know, that's pretty similar. The integrative studies, formerly known as critical, studies and experimental practices. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> has a lot of room. I mean, I went in planning to be, you know, you were allowed multiple area, or you <span style="color:red" data-ts="835.42" data-end_ts="835.54" title="835.42" id=c_"835.42">__are__</span> a major area of focus, and then multiple areas underneath that. And I'd plan in going and focusing on creative practice, performing, composing, et cetera. Right. I ended up focusing on ethnomusicology because I met Nancy Guy there who's, just a wonderful scholar and a delightful human being. And David Borgo, of course, both of whom are ethnomusicologists. Right. And I, I like, realize this is this, it really resonated with me, and I'm like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="864.54" data-end_ts="864.7" title="864.54" id=c_"864.54">__oh__</span>, you know, I've already got a background in creative practice, why not try something different? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>I didn't know what I was in for. It turns out writing a dissertation is very difficult, <laugh>, I would rather write an opera than a dissertation, given the choice 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Yeah. Well, I think if nothing else, an an opera has the opportunity to be expanded, by performance, where, a dissertation is nothing more than than getting closed in by the very words you chose. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Right. And then, and then <span style="color:red" data-ts="899.58" data-end_ts="899.74" title="899.58" id=c_"899.58">__it__</span>, you know, it's a, it's a weird, process of closing in, opening up, closing in as you meet with advisors. And then the defense, you know, is also, but my defense was a joy. It was <span style="color:red" data-ts="912.1" data-end_ts="912.22" title="912.1" id=c_"912.1">__a__</span> opening up, but it's like, yeah, you get closed in by these words, and then you go to the defense and they make you realize all these other areas you can go. It's weird, but you end up having a fixed, you know, you end up with a fixed product. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Indeed. Now, some people that I know have taken their dissertation used it as an opportunity to sort of like, expand on the concept other people, their dissertation represents the last time they ever want to talk about that subject again. Right. Which was it for you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Excuse me. Just drinking some tea there. Sure. For me it is definitely, I want to write a book based on it. It's not the final say, from my perspective, or is it? I think, I mean, it's a great compilation of, of interviews. The interview people I interviewed were wonderful <span style="color:red" data-ts="963.04" data-end_ts="963.26" title="963.04" id=c_"963.04">__pe__</span> the dissertation's called improvising technology, configuring identities and interfaces in electroacoustic music. Typical, you know, dissertation very long. You have to take a breath in the middle of it, the title, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You know of the title. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Yeah. It's like, but, I interviewed people from Nell's Klein of Wilco to Watada, Leo Smith, to Robert Heka of Ableton, about, you know, their use of technology. And there's some really wonderful quotes in there, and I want to tease out more information. And I felt that if I had had another six months to write, it would've been really good. I, I mean, it was, it was fine enough as is obviously to pass, but, it's not my, not the last thing I have to say on it, and I really hope to get a book out of it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, the, the concept of taking a taking an ethnomusicologist view of the technology is something that hasn't been done very much. And I think it's, it's maybe a little problematic because things are changing incredibly fast and, and, preferences become old hat become a cliche and then come back around as, a warm remembrance incredibly fast now. And, but it doesn't seem like there's very many people that are focusing on documenting as it goes through that progression. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Yeah. I mean, and you're one of the people that are doing that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I'm, I started a little <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Yeah. I mean, with this, this podcast. Yeah. Oh, with 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The podcast. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Yeah. I mean, it, it is a, you know, it is an ethnographic work. Yeah, that's true. That's true. It's maybe not as strictly defined by anthropologists and some ethnomusicologists, you know, there's always this debate between, you know, journalism versus, you know, some veneer of objectivity that the academy might present. But, you know, most people don't buy that objectivity stuff anymore. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I'm, I'm also trying not to sleep with any of the people that I'm interviewing, so that makes, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>There's such a, such a history in ethnomusicology of, people that will remain, anonymous at this point. But yeah. How to, how to get information from your, your interviewees, sleep with them, <laugh>, get 'em drunk, get 'em high, you know? Exactly. It's like, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. You know, I'm keeping this barrier of Skype between me and anyone on the other end of the microphone line, so that should, that should work out positively. So what, so you, you named some of the people that you've talked to in, in terms of like, this concept of, of, of your behind your dissertation, but the long, take a breath name in the middle of it, title doesn't necessarily really make it clear what exactly you're looking into. Is it, is it mostly that you're looking into how technology has changed people's approach to music making? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>It's kind of both. It's, I mean, it's a, you know, it's an ethnographic examination of how artists both conceptualize their relationship with technology, but also how the technology possibly configures them to work in certain ways, which, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1166.95" data-end_ts="1167.3" title="1166.95" id=c_"1166.95">__which__</span>, which caused some really interesting debates in the interview process. You know, so it's artists, we all like talking about how we conceptualize our relationship with our tools, how we work with them, how we view it. But when you say, so what <span style="color:red" data-ts="1183.9" data-end_ts="1184.06" title="1183.9" id=c_"1183.9">__is__</span> a tool? You know, does a tool make you do things? Or something like, you know, it's like artists go, go really hot and cold on that, you know, so 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Yeah. Well, not only <span style="color:red" data-ts="1194.26" data-end_ts="1194.46" title="1194.26" id=c_"1194.26">__did__</span> a, a lot of times just even talking about it'll freeze them in place, you know, there's, there's not a lot of love talking about the gear being a creative tool or whatever. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Yeah. Or giving some agency to the interaction. I mean, so much of, of the Western art music tradition is the art is in charge of everything. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. But this is of course has begun to change. And, you know, many people would talk about their, the technology, you know, it's, it's difficult when you start, cuz I, I tend to go, I don't know if you know the, the, the soci social, scientist, theorist, Bruno Laur, but I tend to go into his direction where, you know, humans and other things are all, participating and associated with agency. And so, you know, some artists, I, you know, I say, well, does this affect the way you play this piece of equipment? And some would be like, oh no, not at all. And others would be like, oh, oh, absolutely. Wada, Leo Smith has this wonderful, at talks at length of the Wawa pedal, how when his foot touches it, the pedal knows he's touching it. And, you know, and there's this like two-way communication going on. You know, it's like the, it's, yeah. So it's, you know, it's, it's, it's different people, you know, conceptualize it different ways. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Let's talk a little bit about how that might work for you, because you are a, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1287.02" data-end_ts="1287.14" title="1287.02" id=c_"1287.02">__y__</span> you're a trumpet player, which, you know, has this potential of being, relatively technology free, other than the obvious technology of the trumpet. But you certainly wrap your ar arms around all kinds of technology. And you also, what are the things I notice is you are, you are one of the people that, that I know of that goes way out of their way to put together interesting duets or interesting combos and, I don't know if it's whether to push yourself or push the other person or what the, what the goal behind it is, but you find a way to sort of like, interact with a lot of people, many of whom are very technology, based in their work. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>It's, it's very important to me to, to keep, mixing it up. And duos are, are just one <span style="color:red" data-ts="1341.9" data-end_ts="1342.02" title="1341.9" id=c_"1341.9">__of__</span> the joys of my life because it's like, they're usually fairly easy to plan. You don't have to get a big old doodle doc out to plan the dates and stuff, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>But, you know, the, the choice of who to work with is, you know, it really, you know, works into like, how, I mean, I consider myself an improviser and a composer, and most of my duos, in fact, all of them that I can think of are all, well, some of the Brad dudes is composed, but it's mostly, you know, improvised and if not entirely improvised. And, so the, the selection of a partner is like, super important from Gregory Taylor to, David Bogo to Andrew <span style="color:red" data-ts="1380.81" data-end_ts="1381.1" title="1380.81" id=c_"1380.81">__Pass__</span>, Thomas McNally, Woody Aplin <span style="color:red" data-ts="1383.2" data-end_ts="1383.42" title="1383.2" id=c_"1383.2">__now__</span>, you know, just keeps going, Nicholas <span style="color:red" data-ts="1387.36" data-end_ts="1387.58" title="1387.36" id=c_"1387.36">__Deo__</span>. But you know, it, it keeps it, it keeps it always surprising to me and it always pushes me and makes it enjoyable and new. And I always pick people I like talking with too, to play with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1402.81" data-end_ts="1403.3" title="1402.81" id=c_"1402.81">__because__</span> I find that that's like, you know, you can always tell a good improviser, usually not all the time, but by the conversation you have with them. Sure, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>I mean, I, I do, I view, you know, improvisation as a, a live interactive construction, you know, that's taking place and where we're not only constructing ourselves, but we're constantly being informed with possibilities as how to proceed with the construction by the environment, the partners we're working with, the technology we're working with. All this is informing us as well as us being a participant in the creation of it. It's this big, you know, feedback loop 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right now. One of the things I would say, though, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1444.46" data-end_ts="1444.74" title="1444.46" id=c_"1444.46">__when__</span>, when I listen to the work that you've done with some of the people whose work I know very well, so like Gregory Taylor for example, I would say that in collaboration with him, the conversation that you create or the conversation you have or the construction you build is very different from what he would do alone. And kind of represents, represents your bringing aggression to the table. I'll just put it that way, <laugh>, because I don't know how else to put it. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1478.87" data-end_ts="1479.22" title="1478.87" id=c_"1478.87">__Where__</span>, you know, I don't know a kind of way to put it that still will leave the impression to the listeners about exactly what's happening there. I feel like you have a very aggressive kind of style and aggressive ear, right. And when you work with people who might tend towards the more ambient, you draw them into that and draw an energy out of 'em. That's very unique. Now, why, first of all, what is it about you that has that sort of aggressive nature? I mean, is it something that you, youve ever intellectualized? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Well, absolutely. I mean, I'd like to talk about Carl Young again, <laugh>, no, maybe not. But, you know, it, it goes back, I view a lot of it is, you know, we're so influenced by the things we do when we're young that we find joyful, and we still look for the joy of those things. And, you know, I did symphonic work, but I was also playing in punk bands in the late seventies and early eighties. And I just loved that, ability to just get it all out, you know, just to, just to get it all out on stage to be, you know, banging away at the over amplified guitar with the feedback and just letting things just explode. You know, I just really enjoyed that. And I st I gotta admit I still have some of that, that, that, that sort of punk aggressiveness. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>I really enjoy that. And there's usually one place, a set that I let it unleash, . <affirmative>, I try to limit it, because it can, it can be a little off-putting, but other people really enjoy it because I also, you know, like it, the Desert Fathers. So if you take a listen to our last album, which you know, by the way, streams, entirely for free on my, website, Jeff Kaisercom. And you listen to a track, one of my favorite tracks, called PaaS, it starts out with this like sh shifting morphing trumpet corral that's built up in layers, you know, one after another. And, and, you know, max, I'm just throwing things into buffers and letting them phase in and out of relationships with each other. Sure. So, I, I mean, if you wanna intellectualize it, it's like all, you know, there's the church in the punk side by side in that one track 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Right. You know, so 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Yeah. It's actually funny that you point that out because, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1636" data-end_ts="1636.22" title="1636" id=c_"1636">__and__</span>, and maybe you could tell by my, statements that that's, that's something I had been just listening to just before we initiated this call, so, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Oh, actually, I didn't know that. That's, that's, yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Indeed. Right. That's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1649.02" data-end_ts="1649.06" title="1649.02" id=c_"1649.02">__one__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>The more recent ones. So I, I really like it a lot. It's like we recorded that at, you know, Stein in Amsterdam, and it's just, that album is so full of just, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1659.5" data-end_ts="1659.62" title="1659.5" id=c_"1659.5">__I__</span>, I'm not only happy with the sound of it, but every time I listen to it, I have memories of us hanging out in Amsterdam, Gregory and I. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. Yeah, that's sounds like fun. One of the things that I find interesting is how little of the punk aesthetic has actually, even, even though it ha, you know, the, the creative work, was initially done long, long ago, how little of that seems to have made it into either the academic cannon or, or any sort of, experimental music. I, I'm not sure why that is. And about the only other place I actually am starting to see it a little bit is in sort of the outgrowth of music coming from the modular synth wor world. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1709.85" data-end_ts="1710.14" title="1709.85" id=c_"1709.85">__Yeah__</span>. Where there's really a preference for noisy and very mechanical sounding riffs rather than, you know, sweet melodies. But I'm, I'm really surprised that that hasn't become a bigger part of our, our discussion on the experimental side of it. Certainly in the pop realms, punk was, was embraced, co-opted and, recycled into Green Day or whatever, and, turned into popular music. But it seems like that aesthetic has just not made it into, the experimental music world nearly as much as I thought it would've. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Yeah. I mean, part of me wants to, to blame the aspects of the academy as being about perpetuating, you know, the ways of work and people protecting their, their worlds of work, you know, their, or their realms, you know, by not letting people with those aesthetics in, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>But I, I think that's less and less so I think that they're, you know, we're starting to see more and more that the academy's needing to open their door to, to people with wider views, or the people themselves can get in the door without sharing those views, and then are able to, you know, unleash them within the academy, I think. So we have a lot of younger composers, I think, that get, that bring, a lot of that with them and, and stuff. And of course, improvisation in the academy was at odds for a long time as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I think, I think that even talking about the Academy as sort of a singular entity might be giving it more due than it's, than it deserves. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>I think so. I, I I shouldn't have, I hope. Yeah. I shouldn't have even, said it. I just, like, there are certain institutions, you know, which really have worked at perpetuating certain ideas, but, you know, the academy is a lot more wide open. I'll, I'll say when I first, my first round of applications for PhD, which, came before me just giving up, is that I, I chose quite a few places and, you know, was very honest about my influences and what I wanted to do. And, I got so many reply letters that said the same thing, you know, there's a rejection, and then they'd all, you know, say, have you thought about Cal Arts? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, my, you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Know, yeah. <laugh>, I had that so many times, and that's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Hilarious. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Yeah. And I, I love Cal Arts, but I already had a master's degree, and that was all they were offering at the time. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>But, yeah, so yeah, I should not speak of a monolithic academy. Of course, there's great diversity within well, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1875.4" data-end_ts="1875.62" title="1875.4" id=c_"1875.4">__in__</span> programs. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, there is, and I mean, there are, there is a pretty lot of real estate in the, in music academia for certain, that still seems to be struggling with whether a saxophone is a proper instrument or not. Right. Boy, and 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Yeah, there, there, there are places, you know, where that's still going on, or, you know, even, or 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Certainly 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Much less so <span style="color:red" data-ts="1898.38" data-end_ts="1898.5" title="1898.38" id=c_"1898.38">__a__</span> laptop. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Yeah. Well, and, and the concept of improvisation as something worthy of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1904.87" data-end_ts="1905.22" title="1904.87" id=c_"1904.87">__study__</span> still gets, you know, you squinty ice from people. They, they aren't certain that that's something that's really an academic pursuit. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Certainly. But I mean, that's, that's, that was the way it was that started to, that's really changed. You know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1920.9" data-end_ts="1921.1" title="1920.9" id=c_"1920.9">__the__</span>, we've got the Oxford companion improvisation coming out, right. We've got all these volumes on it. And I, I remember when I first got here, I asked George Lewis something about improvisation, versus composition. He just looks at me <span style="color:red" data-ts="1935.62" data-end_ts="1935.66" title="1935.62" id=c_"1935.62">__and__</span> goes, are people still having that conversation? <laugh>? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right on. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Yeah. I hear you. And I was like, oh, George, thank you for, yeah. It was all in my head. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1944.11" data-end_ts="1944.46" title="1944.11" id=c_"1944.11">__Right__</span>. On one level that said and done, there are places that still, you know, you know, don't want to welcome that discussion, you know, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I, I think that there's actually a lot of places and, you know, maybe that, that serves, that serves some purpose, but, it's exciting to me to sort of see the, see the track that you've made for yourself. I find that, I find it exciting because to me, it represents kind of a, hope in a cool potential future, right? Someone who embraces technology, who embraces, while simultaneously embracing virtuosity on instrument. Someone who is equally at home doing work via digital streaming, as well as live, live work. It's in a way, you're kind of, you kind of represent a, a great option for a modern renaissance person. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Well, thank you. From, your Lips to Search committee's, ears, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Right. There you go. But I think it's, I mean, I just think it's, it is hopeful and, and as, as your career continues, I, you know, I'm, I'm hoping that opens doors and opens eyes for other people to also look at it as, you know, having this, the, this kind of artist scholar, perspective perspective, but with Yeah. With sort of like technology being a part of that, of both the artist and the scholar side of it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Yeah. Yeah. I really, really hope so. I mean, when I read David Borg's book and was it, when did it come out? 2006, sink or Swarm, I kind of like felt this great hope for the musical world. I, I don't want to, you know, exaggerate, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2059.88" data-end_ts="2060.1" title="2059.88" id=c_"2059.88">__or__</span> at least for the world as I knew it. It's like I'll hear was somebody writing about these things, you know, all the things that concern me all at once, you know, improvisation, technology instruments, you know, and stuff. I don't know if you've read that text, but 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I haven't. I'm, yeah, but it's already, I, I just, I just, looked it up online for a quick, for a quick pickup because it sounds like something that I need to read. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Well, and he would, you know, he would quickly also recommend some of his, more, his recent articles where he is kind of updated or not updated, developed some of these ideas, that can be found on jstor or his, I think probably on his webpage, I imagine David borgo.com. But he's like, been, you know, really, the only word is inspirational that somebody can do all of this stuff together. Right. You know, and, and he writes really well, I just looked at a chapter he's sending out, and I'm like, oh my God, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2121.7" data-end_ts="2121.9" title="2121.7" id=c_"2121.7">__want__</span> to write like this, you know, <laugh>. Yeah. So there is, there is, you know, there is hope. And then when you, and there's some really interesting texts out there, Gary Peter's philosophy of improvisation I've really enjoyed. There's this other one, oh, improvisation. Oh, what the heck is it? God, what is the name of the author? I cannot remember for the life of me, but it's a wonderful take that includes views of improvisation going back to the, the classical music era to contemporary and stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That sounds, sounds really, really good. So I'm gonna have to dig into some of this. Yeah. Get back into reading. I dunno, lately it seems like I've been, well, you know, if you could see my desk, it's some combination of circuit boards printed out instructions for compiler options. It's just a mess. So I'm afraid I'm in that one part of my life where I don't get to read very much <laugh>. I hate that part. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Yeah. I, I'm sitting here in a, in a big, big mess myself. How many, by the way, the book, book is by Edgar Landgraf is called Improvisation as Art. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>One of the things that is really changing a lot in the whole music, especially I would say the experimental scene, because it's kind of taking longer than in other scenes, is, the change in how we create, musical artifacts. And, I bring this up because, among the many things that you've done, you have been the owner, creator of an extremely prolific, musical label, called pfMENTUM. We were kind of talking a little bit before the podcast about the pronunciation of it, but we're gonna go with pfMENTUM because that's probably the easiest thing for people to spell and look up on the internet in talking about, doing a label, first of all, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2239.12" data-end_ts="2239.34" title="2239.12" id=c_"2239.12">__how__</span>, like, how many releases have you done? It's some extraordinary number. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>It, it started, it's starting to surprise me. I think we've got like, 88 number, 88 is going to press then this next week. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Unbelievable. And, some of them feature your work, but there's a lot of work by others. How do you choose who is going to be, embraced by your label? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Well, it's kind of, you know, an interesting, it's a, you know, and I have had lawyers involved with this along the way for different things. And one of them referred to it as a non-business model model, <laugh>, <laugh>, or as something like that. Because it really is, kind of a, it is like, I, I refer to it as a curated collective, and the curation comes through, really through the artists kind of seek us out that, that resonate with what we're doing. And, then myself and Louis Lopez listened to it. I mean, we're, we're after a couple things. We're after, we're really after people that are incorporating improvisation and, you know, that maybe hopefully have some unique, way or idiosyncratic look at music. But we're also looking for something that's recorded well and is, is something that's gonna be interesting to listen to on multiple levels. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Right. So it's, it's a, there is not like a, I could not pull up a Google Doc that says, selection methodology, you know, <laugh>. But, it, it, it really kind of sorts itself out as people that seek us out with similar, especially more so now there's a constant stream. And it's, it's difficult. I just don't have enough hours in the day because it's definitely a labor of love, not of profit. Right. Yeah. And we still do objects too, which is really weird. And that also, helps sort people out as well, because a lot of people just wanna do digital releases now, but we like doing objects and we're branching into, cassette tapes and vinyl, which seems like the opposite of the industry. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. You're going the opposite way. But I think that's actually really cool because first of all, creating those objects sort of, I mean, there's, there's something about that that makes it seem like more of a, a definitive effort, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>I, I think so. And that, that kind of, like I said, I, what was I, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2399.37" data-end_ts="2399.61" title="2399.37" id=c_"2399.37">__that__</span>, that's kind of a self-selection thing for who wants to release as well, because there're people approaching that just wanna do digital, and we say, no, we want to do objects. And, you know, there is, you know, this, there is a cost associated that will be shared, by the artist. Right. You know, and so that kind of like tells you the person that wants to invest money, you know, <laugh>, they're, and frequently, you know, all of us labor at different jobs, very few of us are making, much money off this kind of music. Sure. You know, this, this, shows the people that really are interested in believers, you know, for lack of a better word, in this project, that we're doing, you know, getting the music out there 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Now, in addition to Object though, you do have some things that are, I noticed the one <span style="color:red" data-ts="2446.39" data-end_ts="2446.61" title="2446.39" id=c_"2446.39">__De__</span> Desert Fathers album is a streaming o only album. What, when do you decide to do that? Is it like when you run out of physical media 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Or, exactly. So the, the, the first <laugh>, the first, desert Fathers album Coptic icons is streaming, only, and you can buy that on band camp. We, we did a limited run on that and ran out pretty quickly. But the, the current one is still available on CDs. We did experiment with one all digital release, and I think it's, I mean, I played on it and, you know, I don't play on, I think you know, Michael at this point, Michael Kovich, Kovich might have more releases out on PF men than I do. Oh, really? You know, he's been very prolific lately. But, so we tried a purely digital release and, we couldn't get radio play or reviews at the same level. And Emmy, it was well recorded with very nice studio. I played on it, Ted Burns, the Wonderful drummer, and, Tom McNally on guitar. And it just, we couldn't get play, and we just find out if we send CDs to the radio stations, we'll get play, you know, and it also ups the amount of reviews we'll get. We got, you know, a couple, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2526.42" data-end_ts="2526.54" title="2526.42" id=c_"2526.42">__a__</span> handful of reviews for that one. But when we send CDs out, we get reviewed. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's interesting. That I think, you know, it's important to consider because if you, if you would follow some people's suggestions for how to put together, you know, some sort of career or portion of your career that's related to doing, to doing music, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2547.85" data-end_ts="2548.14" title="2547.85" id=c_"2547.85">__that__</span> the idea of making physical artifacts seems to have gone out. You know, their, their suggestion would be, you'd be better off making t-shirts. Now, I'm not sure that people are going to be dying for choir boys t-shirts any, anytime soon, <laugh>. But, it's, I think, I actually think it's really interesting to find out what are the positive gains in having physical media. And certainly the, the review thing is something, I think if nothing else, you put yourself in the reviewer's seat. And if you get a snow, if you get a, like an avalanche of emails, and then you get some physical media, which is the one that feels like something that you could actually, that you actually want to accomplish. I mean, the thing that you can hold in your hand, certainly has, it seems like it has more psychic weight in some way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Yeah. It's, it is, you know, it is one of those things. I mean, in the digital world, it's like, you know, it's, it's much easier to get lost. I mean, the physical world, it's easy to get lost. There's so many CDs out there, so many cassette tapes and albums out there. But it, it's, its like much easier to get pushed down on email, you know, to-do list than it is, you know, if something's in your hand, like you said. And, you know, that is part of the reason we do this. I mentioned it's a labor of love that's not a big profit, but, you know, our main goal is to help the artists get their music out there to be heard and shared out in the world. And, you know, this results in, you know, other benefits, gigs and et cetera. Right. Opportunities. Yeah. Yeah. But the, but the, the, you know, the best way we have found to be heard and reviewed is physical objects. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, yeah. That makes a lot of sense. Now, when I looked over, your bio, something came up that I wanted to make sure to ask you. You seem to work with a lot of kind of, bizarre grouping. So we talked about you doing some solo stuff and doing duets. But what is, you know, I, I think some of them are, are pretty clear. So Double Quartet is a pretty obviously, pretty obvious grouping, but I have no idea what a ACO <span style="color:red" data-ts="2690.05" data-end_ts="2690.34" title="2690.05" id=c_"2690.05">__deck__</span> Tet might be. And, yeah. And I know from talking to others and talking to Andrew who you've, you've kind of, drawn into some of these larger ensembles. You put together some really strange groupings of players. Why don't you kind of cover some of 'em for me, and then particularly why you would choose certain groupings for certain kinds of work? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Yeah, the, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2717.72" data-end_ts="2717.94" title="2717.72" id=c_"2717.72">__ACO__</span> DTE was originally the Octo dte, which is just a playful way of saying 18. I don't think it's actually saying that, but then, I don't know, I just came up with his name and then I was making the posters and I realized, oh, there's only 17 people in this group <laugh> the first time. So, I mean, it's one of those things that I was a goofball to begin with. I mean, pf Manto, I obviously, you know, like playing with the sound of words. And so I just said, oh, we'll call it the Acod <span style="color:red" data-ts="2747.1" data-end_ts="2747.18" title="2747.1" id=c_"2747.1">__deck__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2747.18" data-end_ts="2747.38" title="2747.18" id=c_"2747.18">__head__</span>. And everybody will say, what is that? You know? So I, I didn't want to call it the Jeff Kaiser large ensemble, cuz there's already the longstanding vinne golia, large ensemble. Right. And I, I didn't want to, I almost, I didn't wanna call it orchestra cuz that has, other connotations. And I didn't wanna call it the big band because I didn't want to create expectations as to what the sound would be. Right, right. So yeah, I just went with a made up name. And it sounds real though, doesn't it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It does. Well, and it's interesting that you bring up this idea of, of, certain things, having expectations. I, I was trained as guitarist and the instrument, I, my hands are kinda getting messed up now, so I can't play as much as I used to be able to. It's, it's really unfortunate, but nevertheless, that's the instrument I have the most facility with. But, I find that I really don't like pulling it out at a gig because having a guitar in your hand is loaded with expectations and what the, I the concept of virtuosity on, on a guitar represents something very specific. You I'm sure run into that sometimes with, when you, pull out a trumpet, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Oh, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But I think that there's not an expectation behind an ACO <span style="color:red" data-ts="2834.86" data-end_ts="2835.1" title="2834.86" id=c_"2834.86">__deck__</span> tat and so that probably does give you some freedom to go whatever direction you chose, you chose to. Well, how do you, how do you combat, especially, and I would say especially with your solo stuff, with solo performance, how do you strike the concept of what people's expectation is of a trumpet? I mean, I got around it by saying I'm not taking the guitar to the gigs. I, I've got my little modular synthesizer. And since nobody has any clue what that's supposed to sound like, I get away with doing what I like. Right. But I can't seem to do that with a guitar or at least feel comfortable doing it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Well, it, it's something, and I'm not gonna be one of those modernist type that says, I don't listen to the audience expectations. I don't <span style="color:red" data-ts="2882.86" data-end_ts="2883.02" title="2882.86" id=c_"2882.86">__get__</span> that into consideration. I don't buy that. I think we have, don't either <span style="color:red" data-ts="2885.7" data-end_ts="2885.82" title="2885.7" id=c_"2885.7">__have__</span> these voices, these voices inside our head, and to deny 'em is to be delusional, that these things are all inside our head. But, it's funny because, I, I play with this, I got this group called Trumpet, trumpet with Dave <span style="color:red" data-ts="2899.7" data-end_ts="2900.1" title="2899.7" id=c_"2899.7">__Ballou__</span>, on the, who's at Towson University. And, we do trumpet duos with, and then we each run our, trumpet through max patches. And, he's a, he's a, you know, a since, a serious virtuo. So, he's played with everybody from Steely Dan to Broadway, long running Broadway shows and all that stuff. So I mean, he's got some strong credit and, you know, I'm not a Dave <span style="color:red" data-ts="2929.46" data-end_ts="2929.86" title="2929.46" id=c_"2929.46">__Ballou__</span>, but I've got some good credit too. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>I've played film scores and, you know, done all that stuff. And, you know, sometimes it's pretty funny. Like, people go, wow, you really can't play the trumpet after all. <laugh>, you know, after hearing me make whatever sounds it is I make with it. But, we run across this, this, it always startles me to run across this preconception that people have with this, this, this, these preconceived ideas that they bring to the trumpet. So Dave and I played at the New school, as part of the, at the new school in New York in June, as part of the, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2967.36" data-end_ts="2967.58" title="2967.36" id=c_"2967.36">__is__</span> Im the International Society for Improvised Music Conference. Right. And we're, you know, we got the microphones stuck in inside the bells. So you're, you know, the trumpet at some point becomes more of an LFO than anything else, you know, <laugh>, and it's, but no, we're really playing the horn. But this, this guy raises his hands and ask, he goes, Hey, you guys, what are you doing? He's really neat, but you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2991.62" data-end_ts="2991.74" title="2991.62" id=c_"2991.62">__I__</span> can't hear the trumpet. Can you fix that 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>? You know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>But you know, what I told him is I say, you know, I don't view this that I'm playing trumpet. I view it as I'm playing this hybrid instrument that has all of this technology. You know, technology is just, you know, the tools and techniques used by a, a, a culture for a, you know, at a certain time or whatever. And so the trumpet is a technology and it's hybrid with the electronics. The way I'm, the way I'm using it, I don't view it as, you know, some people might view it as a, like putting a mute in, it just changes the <span style="color:red" data-ts="3026.24" data-end_ts="3026.46" title="3026.24" id=c_"3026.24">__tom__</span>, the trumpet, but you're still playing the trumpet. Right. You know, but I view it as this whole, you know, hybrid instrument, you know, that that's, it's not, I'm not playing the trumpet, I'm playing this thing, whatever it's called. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Yeah, I hear that. So yeah, the, yeah, so if you think of, I mean, I just spent a little time with, Jane <span style="color:red" data-ts="3050.02" data-end_ts="3050.3" title="3050.02" id=c_"3050.02">__regular__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3050.96" data-end_ts="3051.18" title="3050.96" id=c_"3050.96">__on__</span> a local person who focuses on extended, actually I'm gonna be interviewing her next week for the podcast, but she focuses a lot on extended techniques on the flute. And she, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>We played together last spring, actually, in San Oh, did you? Diego. Oh, okay. Yeah. She's wonderful. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. She's an amazing player. I, I've seen her play a couple of times and it just, I still find it shocking, every time. But, she's a person now who's looking at tech technology, particularly really creative uses of Ableton Live to, sort of create a new extended, extended technique, if you would. That, you know, but for her, it's still, it still represents kind of an extension of the flute where it sounds like you're saying you're really thinking this as, as representing a completely new instrument. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Yeah. In fact, and I have a lot of friends and so that, that use the term extended technique. But I actually don't like the term mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And I, I totally know why we use it in every now and then. I use it <span style="color:red" data-ts="3117.46" data-end_ts="3117.66" title="3117.46" id=c_"3117.46">__to__</span>, and I mean, you know, very great thoughtful players use that term. But I, I started to think about it and I actually talked about this in, in a lecture and, and, at Cal <span style="color:red" data-ts="3129.86" data-end_ts="3130.06" title="3129.86" id=c_"3129.86">__Arts__</span> a while ago, there, it was kind of, I don't know, I don't view it as extended technique. If it's on the instrument, it's idiomatic, it's part of the instrument extended is creating this hierarchy of that. It's privileging certain traditions Right. And certain ways of playing. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3146.22" data-end_ts="3146.5" title="3146.22" id=c_"3146.22">__Right__</span>. And so I, I think it's all trumpet playing. So I do split tones when I'm playing acoustically. I'll do split tones, multiphonics, you know, different types of toing, slap toing and stuff. I don't view any of that as extended, but it's actually idiomatic. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. I see. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Yeah. But, but, but I, I do, but I know why it's being used to. I know why the term is used. But yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, well, thanks for spanking me down there. Jeff. No, no, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>No, man. I, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3173.36" data-end_ts="3173.58" title="3173.36" id=c_"3173.36">__no__</span>, no, no. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3174.63" data-end_ts="3174.98" title="3174.63" id=c_"3174.63">__Cause__</span> I, you're, everybody uses that term and I, I do at times too, but I've started to, I've started like trying to decide, I think it's, it's, the, the word extended is, is privileging a base tech a base level of technique. That's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>True. That that's really true. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>So no, no spanking down intended Darwin It's, it's just something I, I like to talk about, because I don't think we, I don't think it's one of those things that just is such a part of our vocabulary as musicians that we don't examine it. And, I, I, you know, I got lots of unexamined areas, <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, right. But now, and I've, I've already used up a lot of your time, but let me just, let me just run down one more thing with you, which is based off of what you just said, this, this, this desire, this like need to examine things. I think in all cases, it's really easy for us once something becomes, once you hear something five times, say, it's easy to then kind of very loosely use that phrase as if it <span style="color:red" data-ts="3238.58" data-end_ts="3238.7" title="3238.58" id=c_"3238.58">__is__</span> normed. Right. It's, you know, so I, I hear people talk about extended technique long enough. I am willing to say, well, extended technique, it's a real thing because it's got a word behind it, right? Yeah. Many of the things that are happening right now in music don't have names behind them. And hence, on one hand, maybe that's nice because it means that we haven't boxed it in yet. But on the other hand, it means that it can't be, it can't be easily talked about. It can't be described. We can't, since, since there's not a common vocabulary for it, it's not something we can talk about. It's not something we can study or critique very well. Where, what is the limits of vocabulary, both in the good, in the positive and negative ways. I mean, you're, as an ethnomusicologist, that's, that's looking at currency, it must be really difficult to have to talk about things that don't have names. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>It it is. And, yeah, it is difficult. And it's, you know, one of the, sometimes a desire is to <span style="color:red" data-ts="3310.25" data-end_ts="3310.45" title="3310.25" id=c_"3310.25">__come__</span> is, you know, to coin some new word for these things. I try to like keep from doing that. But, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that used to be the currency of a, of an academic was if you were the person that named a thing, then you had some kind of value. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Yeah. It's kind of like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3326.04" data-end_ts="3326.33" title="3326.04" id=c_"3326.04">__yeah__</span>, going back to the Old Testament, it's like, Adam naming the animals That's right. Gave him power. But you know what, I just thought about this quote from Joel Ryan. Do you know Joel? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Heard the name? I don't, I don't know personally. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>He, he's in, he's in Evan Parker's, electro-acoustic ensemble. Okay. And, and he's also been in associated with Stein since the eighties, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I <span style="color:red" data-ts="3350.81" data-end_ts="3350.93" title="3350.81" id=c_"3350.81">__believe__</span>. That's probably where I would've heard of him. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3352.29" data-end_ts="3352.49" title="3352.29" id=c_"3352.29">__Right__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Yeah. But he has this, I got this quote from an interview with him, and it's like right in front of me so I can just like, it's just a short one. He says, in music, we are still under the sway of semiotics and language philosophy, which I think is pernicious because it always degrades what musicians know about music and elevates some sort of symbolic representation concept of music. So the representation becomes more important than the stuff of music. The representation is just a tool. And it's true that writing can liberate possibilities, but it always has to reflect back to the meat of music, to the wet meat of music <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, nice. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>I love that quote. And that's excellent. Joel is just so incredibly thoughtful. I felt so, you know, it was really wonderful that interview him. But, I think, you know, that, I think that as we examine these things more and more, these, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3407.15" data-end_ts="3407.37" title="3407.15" id=c_"3407.15">__the__</span>, that we're <span style="color:red" data-ts="3408.21" data-end_ts="3408.29" title="3408.21" id=c_"3408.21">__going__</span>, we're gonna start to come up with terms, but we need to keep pointing it back to music, also to experiential knowledge so that we don't, overplay some, some, you know, written knowledge or something like that. But we, you know, we value experiential knowledge and that, there is frequently, an inability to express, experiential knowledge in words. Right. Or at least <span style="color:red" data-ts="3434.05" data-end_ts="3434.17" title="3434.05" id=c_"3434.05">__a__</span> great difficulty. And this is the bane of all music colleges and ethnomusicologists. How do we talk about something that's one, you know, one mode of understanding music with another mode of understanding words, you know, which are you words, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and it's, you know, I think even the things that we're trying to study, the things that ethnic musicologists like yourself are having to study, can't survive being documented. I mean, it used to be, you know, when I was kind of dipping my toe in it, I would go and look at, you know, when people would go and study, some javanese thing, you know, they would be able to write out the rhythmic, rhythmic patterns that were in use. And, you know, you know, that they weren't exact, but at least they could convey the message. Right. Right. How do you, how do you as, how would you document now a DJ who occasionally hits the table to cause the needle to skip, to build in a certain amount of chance into, the performance that, he's doing? You know, or, or someone who uses a <span style="color:red" data-ts="3510.53" data-end_ts="3510.77" title="3510.53" id=c_"3510.53">__mask__</span> patch to, very liquidly manipulate the tonality of the thing while they're playing. How do you, how do you even approach talking about that in any, in any way and marry it to the work that anyone else is doing? I don't know know. Yeah. I don't know. I'm curious. I'm curious if what you see as the people that are trying to break down or trying to break that down in a way that's useful from a historical standpoint. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Well, you know, and there's this idea of this thick description where you, you describe what's happening and you try to really get into it. And I, I like that idea of, you know, just that, just that, even that, that phrase thick description. It's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Cool, cool 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Phrase. Yeah. And so, you know, Maria Chavez, who is, I interviewed and, she's a DJ who, you know, are you familiar with her work? She's in New York. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>No, I'm not. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>And so she puts objects on the turntable and, you know, uses all sorts of rounded off needles that are gonna skip all the way. And the only way to, to describe that is to, is through poetry and metaphor, I think. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> poetry metaphor. You can go into technical description, but that's not gonna get it. But then to, you know, to not privilege the written word or the notated word in the case of those that notated or that it would work at notating, galon music or, different music from, you know, the continent of Africa, Ako <span style="color:red" data-ts="3605.88" data-end_ts="3606.1" title="3605.88" id=c_"3605.88">__aga__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3606.1" data-end_ts="3606.22" title="3606.1" id=c_"3606.1">__who__</span> has this book about, you know, the difficulty in representing these musics through notation and, and words and stuff. It's really interesting. But, yeah, I think that, that we need to, you know, include recordings, video documentation. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>I think this needs to be all a part of it. And that the, you know, the tr tradition of the dissertation being a written word, I think, you know, we're seeing a lot of more emphasis on the digital humanities, which I think are, you know, are, you know, better at documenting this stuff because they will include video, audio, and stuff like that. Right. And I, I actually videotaped all the interviews and performances of many of the artists and stuff. And I, I would, if, given the time, I mean, I would like to, if I create a book with this, I would like to include those things with it. Because I think it just informs, you know, it gives a more, more full description of what's going on than words only. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Well, Jeff, I want to thank you so much for taking the time to talk with me today. It was a, it was a blast. We kind of, I think I had a list of questions here somewhere, but I immediately hit the eject button as soon as we, as soon as I, got to hear about your background, because it was like, oh, man, I was there too, man. <laugh>. So that was cool. But, I wanna thank you for, for your time. And, one last question. There are going to be a lot of listeners who just have never experienced the kind of music that you do or at the musicology or any of it. If they, if you wanted to give them a taste of something you're interested in, what's the one thing you would point 'em in that's pretty accessible and would give people maybe a, maybe a hunger to learn more 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>As far as, text or listening, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I don't care. Whatever you'd like to, whatever you'd like to point people at. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Well, if they're the, if they're interested in hearing my music, it, most of it streams online for free@jeffkaiser.com. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>As far as, texts, I think that there are actually two classic texts on ethnomusicology, which are a little old fashioned, but are really kind of wonderful. One is How Musical is Man by, John Blacking with a sexist title, but it was, you know, different as a series of lectures. And the other is towards an Anthropology of Music by Alan Miriam. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Both of those are just, just, were very influential texts, but, you know, there's some good ones out there. David BOGOs book has nice, sections of ethno, musicology, ethnography driven scholarship, as does, you know, George Lewis, I don't think is considered an ethnomusicologist in some areas, but I, I consider him one. And his book on the Aacm is, a tour de force of critical examination, as well as, interesting histories and, you know, it's just, wonderful text. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. And can people, get access to your dissertation online somewhere? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>You know, not right now. They can't. It's gonna be available soon, but I'm hoping to have the rewritten version out before then. So. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>All right. Well, when that happens, let me know and I'll pass it along to all the, to all the folks on the other end of the line here. Well, thank you so much. I really appreciate it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Thank you, Darwin Have 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>A great day. Bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And there's another podcast in a bag. Thanks again to Jeff for his, willingness to kind of subject himself to my goofy questions. It was a lot of fun, though. If you wanna check out his work again, you can, eyeball it@jeffkaiser.com. And if you wanna look into his label, pfMENTUM, that is pfmentum.com pf M E N T U m.com. Really interesting stuff kind of all over the map, but in a way that sort of embraces one aesthetic, which is that of experimentalism and improvisation for the sake of the embrace. So again, I want to thank everybody for listening. Want to thank, Libson for their hosting. I want to thank <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_%2774">Cycling '74</a> for being, both a great employer and for being very supportive of the podcast. Thanks Sinopia, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3887.23" data-end_ts="3887.58" title="3887.23" id=c_"3887.23">__great__</span> digital music and all the other sites that help spread the word, not only on the podcast, but on the whole genre. And, but mostly I want to thank you for listening. Hope to see you next week. If you have any questions, drop me a line ddg@cyclingseventyfour.com. Catch you later.
