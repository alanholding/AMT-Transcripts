<b>Darwin: </b>In this week's podcast, I am, pleased to introduce you to one of my best friends in the world. His name's Andrew <span style="color:red" data-ts="16.47" data-end_ts="16.76" title="16.47" id=c_"16.47">__Pass__</span>. He works with me at Cycling 74. He and I interact in a lot of different ways. We perform together often. We work together and talk to each other on a daily basis. And, he is also the person who seems to help me out whenever, things are really looking grim. He covers my back an awful lot. But he's also one of the most amazing, saxophone and clarinet players that I have gotten a chance to work with. And additionally, he has really learned how to deal with the combination of real live instruments, along with, along with electronics and computer-based stuff. So, there's a lot for us to talk about besides just me being his buddy. And with that, I introduce you to Andrew Paske. Andrew, how are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew Pask: </b>Yeah, good. Thanks mate. Thanks for the intro, Darren. Yeah, well, does my, does my mic sound good? That's the thing that I really need to know, because I feel like there's a, there's a, there's a kind of a credibility issue here now in the podcast, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? True enough. No, it actually sounds really good. You sound, you make it sound like a Charlie Rose broadcast or something, so I think we're in, we're in pretty good shape. <span style="color:red" data-ts="92.66" data-end_ts="92.88" title="92.66" id=c_"92.66">__Is__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>He? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Who's he? Yeah. Not a musician. How about that? <laugh>? Yeah. So, you listened to the podcast, so as you know, I tend to like to start them off by asking people to, give us some of their background. So I'm gonna kick it off with, with that, if you could, share a little bit of your background and how you've gotten to become the person that you are. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Hmm. Well, I guess, I guess I would talk about, I guess I'd talk about music, in a way. 'cause I guess that's sort of mostly what's going on. But, so I grew up in New Zealand and, my family mostly musical, and it was all classical music. We were also, we were churchgoers. So I started basically, started music by listening a to a heck of a lot of classic classical. And I was super young and then singing at church. And, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Actually, I, I singing was like a really large part of my musical growing up. I sang in choirs for, oh, 18 years. And I had, I was vocal, I had vocal coaching for years, and I ended up doing, I ended up doing chorus work in operas and singing in early music choirs. And, singing was a really massive part of my musical growth. Then when I went to, <span style="color:red" data-ts="181.75" data-end_ts="182.04" title="181.75" id=c_"181.75">__then__</span> I went to school, you know, I started playing the recorder and all that jazz. And then some point along the line, I ended up when I was about 10 with a clarinet in my hand. And I remember thinking, I remember not knowing what the sound of it was. I remember thinking that it was actually this, when I heard an oboe in an orchestra, I thought that was what it was gonna end up sounding like once I became good. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Sure. But <laugh>. But, that wasn't the case. But I think that's why I like the sound of the oboe. I think that's why I ended up playing so much soprano saxophone. But, I think the thing that attracted me to, to music and playing always from the start wasn't so much the sort of music that I was playing, but it was the physical act of playing music. I think I've always, and I still, I still really do just enjoy the physical act of putting music together and playing in groups. And I like everything about, you know, the instruments and, and the boxes they go in, and the keys and the buttons that you push and all of that kind of stuff. And, and so I wasn't sort of like, oh, I wasn't ever, <span style="color:red" data-ts="250.43" data-end_ts="250.72" title="250.43" id=c_"250.43">__like__</span>, I heard somebody play and think, oh, I've gotta be like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>It was just, I just sort of started out playing everything and wanting to play everything and wanting to learn how to mechanically be able to, get things under my fingers. Right. Which, which I did, an awful lot of and lots of practice and classical clarinet. And then when I was about 15, I had a teacher at school and she was a jazz piano player, and she gave me antho saxophone and a copy of the Charlie Parker Omni book and played me some Thelonious Monk, which I just thought was <span style="color:red" data-ts="288" data-end_ts="288.2" title="288" id=c_"288">__just__</span> completely incomprehensible. And I, and then I heard bird, and then that was like, uhoh, I've gotta learn how to do this right. I've got to be able to do this. And that was kind of the beginning of the end, really. Career wise, I just pretty much went straight to, I mean, I went to university for a little bit, but I, I just started to kind of like lose faith in the whole classical thing and wanted to be more interested in lots of different kinds of other things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>And I think sort of building upon this curiosity I had with being able to play in lots of different styles and, and just enjoying the act of being in a band, I just kind of gravitated towards this sort of life of playing jazz and playing sessions and using my classical chops to play in, in, stage shows and musicals, sessions. Just all sorts of stuff without ever really kind of thinking about what any of it meant. I just wanted to be good at it. And, that pretty much was it for me for 15 or 20 years. And I left New Zealand and went and moved to Hong Kong, which is a kind of, not the sort of place that you'd expect to be like a target destination for a jazz musician, but actually it was kind of amazing because there was so much work there playing jazz with these cool Filipino guys. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>And there was so much work doing pit orchestra work and teaching and playing on Chinese pop music and all that kind of stuff. And really there, it was sort of like a, it was a little bit like a professional kind of apprenticeship for me, you know. I played 350 gigs a year for six years. Oh my goodness. And, you know, multiple gigs a week. It was just, it was, it was just getting that amount of flying time and, and, you know, learning every jazz standard there was, you know, by the end of it all, with the guys that I'd play with, we would go two or three months without repeating a song. And, <span style="color:red" data-ts="423.77" data-end_ts="423.99" title="423.77" id=c_"423.77">__it__</span> that, with that experience, that amount of flying time, just, I don't know, it, it, it was the most amazing thing. But at the end of it, when I came to LA I felt like it was over. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>And I, I started, when I got to la I started to look around and, think about trying to get into those kind of gigs again. But of course, there's a lot less work here for live musicians and there's a whole scene and all that kind of stuff. So I started, I got a little bit of that sort of work. And then I sat back and realized that maybe I didn't want to be copying everybody else's style the whole time. Maybe I didn't wanna be turning up and sounding like Dave Sandborn or whatever, and maybe I should just sit back and do my own thing. And fortunately at that time was sort of roundabout, you know, when computers were finally starting, well, it seemed to me <span style="color:red" data-ts="474.74" data-end_ts="474.9" title="474.74" id=c_"474.74">__they__</span> were starting to become viable as, you know, day-to-day tools that you would definitely have. This is like end of the nineties. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, you know, every studio had a whole bunch of them, and a whole bunch of problems were happening all over the place. And, and so I kind of just slipped sideways into helping out, music studio guys and composers like keep their computer rigs together, you know, keep digital performer going and check out U s b cables and make sure that everything was installed properly and running properly. And, that <span style="color:red" data-ts="510.55" data-end_ts="510.9" title="510.55" id=c_"510.55">__ended__</span> kind of an interest that I had in creating algorithmic music on a computer myself, which is how I got into Max and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data">PD</a> and all that sort of stuff. And then it kind of led to the development of, you know, the first of like 10 or 12, 14 years worth of live rigs that I've been using to process my own sound. And then that led into working for cycling, and that's led into, helping other people develop their own electronic rigs and, you know, using various kind of like computer integrated systems <span style="color:red" data-ts="549.7" data-end_ts="549.92" title="549.7" id=c_"549.7">__and__</span> live performance in a whole bunch of different situations. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Now, one, one question I would have, like almost right out of the bat is that when you talk about working with, with the horns and with the clarinet, one of the things you talked about is that you really liked the physical act of playing. But, it seems like when you moved to LA and started doing all of this sort of technical work and started also doing technical things for your own musical creations, doesn't doesn't that sort of preclude spending a lot of time physically with the instrument? Not 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Necessarily. <span style="color:red" data-ts="591.31" data-end_ts="591.6" title="591.31" id=c_"591.31">__Well__</span>, I mean, there's always practice and, but even though I kind of am allergic to practice and allergic to rehearsing, I, I, I guess I, I guess that I, well, I definitely play less. I mean, there's no way that I play as much as I played back then, but I don't know, there were things about the amount, the amount <span style="color:red" data-ts="614.84" data-end_ts="615" title="614.84" id=c_"614.84">__and__</span> type of playing that I was doing that I was kind of happy to leave behind. And the other thing about being in LA is that, it's sort of like everybody is trying to be everyone and everyone's <span style="color:red" data-ts="626.72" data-end_ts="626.96" title="626.72" id=c_"626.72">__like__</span> trying to be able to do this the best and that the best and audition and be in there and be in the band and go down to the musos union and sit in with the big bands and get the sessions and all that kind of stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>And it's a, it's a bit of a bun fight. And I sort of went, you know what? I think I want to be me, and I think I want people to come and ask me to be on their session, not because I'm good at sounding like Michael Brecker at all, but because they want my sound. Sure. And so it's sort of, that was kinda like the beginning of like all of this playing in other styles and being other things and all that sort of thing. I guess at that time it was sort of like, okay, well now I'm doing my own thing. Now I'm making my own style. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So what, how would you explain your own style? How would you, what would you say kind of represents, the voice that you've developed? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Actually I have no idea. I, I, right from the beginning of, you know, like from my earliest years, there was always, I always had this thing in my mind about what I thought I should sound about, sound like, you know, I first thought that I should sound like an oboe, but I've always had this sort of picture in my mind of the sound that should come out of the end of my horn mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And, and I've always seemed to know when that was sounded wrong. And I actually kind of, it's almost painful how much there's a kind of a gap between what I sound like and what I, what the, the projection of that in my mind, what I intended to do is, and it's kind of like a lot of the time I really hate listening to myself after the fact because I kind of like, I remember what it was that I was trying to do at the time, or I'm like, oh, no, <laugh> god, that sucks. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>And Right. But I think that, I don't actually know. I don't actually <span style="color:red" data-ts="738.8" data-end_ts="739.04" title="738.8" id=c_"738.8">__know__</span>. I couldn't tell you, well, you know, it's a little bit of this and a little bit of that, but I can tell you it's some kind of idea in my mind that just sort of exists that is doubtlessly the product of all of the different kind of situations and styles that I've been in, and all of the different people that I've listened to and, and who I'm currently listening to a whole lot. And, you know, the transcriptions that I've done and the, you know, all of those kind of things just all add up into being this sense that I have of what I should be doing right now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Because I don't know, that doesn't really kind of that, I mean, I, I guess I put, put a label on what I sound like. It's sort of, experimental, <span style="color:red" data-ts="780.59" data-end_ts="781.08" title="780.59" id=c_"780.59">__lyrical__</span>, lyrical sort of, I like melodies and I like dynamics, and I like time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Is there, is there an instrument or like a register of instruments that represents a sound in your head? Or is it more like playing style things? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>I've, it's, it's sort of like appropriateness or <span style="color:red" data-ts="805.38" data-end_ts="805.6" title="805.38" id=c_"805.38">__you__</span>, I play deep instrument. I play bass clarinet, I play baritone saxophone, and I play soprano. I play really high on the clarinet, so I'm not sort of so, concerned with whether or not I have a particular sounding voice. Like you might, like say I was an alto, like say I'm a, like a soprano voice. Right. Or something like that. I don't, I kind of have a concept. 'cause I used to be a boy soprano and I understand what that's like to be <span style="color:red" data-ts="831" data-end_ts="831.16" title="831" id=c_"831">__like__</span>, then I kind of turned into a barone as a singer. So I do understand that that whole kind of like vocal registers kind of thing, but it's more about what's appropriate in the context mm-hmm. <affirmative> that, that decides, that makes, you know, makes me kind of feel like I should act one way or the other. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. So, so from a, so, so the voice inside your head is almost like, unique based on each gig or Yeah. Opportunity. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Interesting. Absolutely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that's, that's interesting because an awful lot of people are the opposite. I mean, I know, and especially in the world of guitar players, and I know we joke about guitar players a fair amount, but in the world of guitar players, oftentimes somebody who has put together their voice and it's a less Paul and it's a certain six effects in a, in a line, and they're gonna sound like Jimmy Page, no matter if you're playing, you know, a samba tune or heavy metal, that's just their voice is, is not as much, or is as much their instrument and the range that they play in and all that kinda stuff as anything. And it sounds like you actually have a very different approach to that, which is that it's more about how you're attacking the melody rather than what the instrument sounds like. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Yep. And actually, I remember now you've just reminded me of, of this book that I used to cop for, <span style="color:red" data-ts="919.62" data-end_ts="919.84" title="919.62" id=c_"919.62">__and__</span> one of the clarinet is kind of interesting 'cause it's written range is exactly the same as guitar. Okay. And, and I used to, I used to play all the time out of this guitar book called Monster Chops mm-hmm. <affirmative>, which is all about like mixing forths together. But I remember there was another book by this, by this by Mick Goodrich, and he, it was sort of like, not so much of a, I don't remember the name of it. It was, well, not so much a, like a whole bunch of like lines and like, this is what you play over the diminished chord and all that kind of stuff. But it was sort of like life lessons and a kind of a speaky, <span style="color:red" data-ts="957.7" data-end_ts="957.92" title="957.7" id=c_"957.7">__oh__</span>, I should find the name of the book. But anyway, it's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting because like one of my first way back when I was a serious guitar player, I had this, audio, this cassette tape, that someone gave me a copy of that was Mick Goodrich doing like a masterclass. And I would listen to that thing obsessively because again, it wasn't, here's a lick to copy. It was more like, here's how to approach, you know, being really good at your instrument. Right. And you really had that wired. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Yeah. And so, something that I remember from this Mick Goodrich book was this idea that he would say, you, you won't, you won't know when you've got your own style. It'll just appear like it's normal. Like you just, you'll just be it. Like, and so I've never, I mean, back when I was going along to a cocktail party in Hong Kong and people were going, Kenny, g Kenny g I would go, alright, so I'll take the soprano, I'll take this particular mouthpiece, I'll stick the microphone right down the belly end of it, so it sounds all nasally and stuff. And, and that's the sound that I'm gonna do for that situation. But now I just, I think I've just internalized all the various possibilities and stuff, and I just play <span style="color:red" data-ts="1030.03" data-end_ts="1030.32" title="1030.03" id=c_"1030.03">__Sure__</span>. That's it. So, yeah. That's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Really interesting. So what are, what do you do on the electronics or computer side of it and how did, how did you develop that? Because, now when, when you and I played together, which, I think the last time was at the Currents Festival down in Santa Fe. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Oh yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>When, when we played together, you tend to have, some pretty unique processing that you do with your, with a computer. And it strikes me, first of all, as really hard. A couple of weeks ago I interviewed Jane <span style="color:red" data-ts="1069.16" data-end_ts="1069.56" title="1069.16" id=c_"1069.16">__Rigler__</span> and she talked about how difficult it was to interact with a computer when you're playing a flute, because the flute really wants you to use two hands. Right. Similar with both clarinet and the saxophones. How do you, what do you do to make your rig playable? And how did you develop that over time? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>I think the mo the motivation was that it would sort of be, I think I started thinking about using sound effects in terms of a solo set, you know, how to kind of generatively or, or not generatively, because I don't think I started out thinking, knowing anything about generat generativity or whatever you wanna call it at all. I was just thinking, I'll be able to like go toot on the horn and it'll go oodle <span style="color:red" data-ts="1118.84" data-end_ts="1119.04" title="1118.84" id=c_"1118.84">__at__</span> the speaker, and I'll be able to play something on top of that, and it'll be, somehow I'll be heading off towards this kind of synthesis of the sound of my acoustic horn and the processing of it. And so that was sort of how I started. So then I've got, okay, you get a laptop and you get, Ooh, now I've gotta be able to play. I can't take my hand off. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>So then you start this whole mad voyage through every single controller known to man, and you, and you do it all. You get pedals, you get foot operated mice, you get little bits of circuit board with buttons on them, and you gaffer tape them onto the side of the saxophone. You, you have all sorts of like, midi <span style="color:red" data-ts="1163.64" data-end_ts="1163.88" title="1163.64" id=c_"1163.64">__pedal__</span> routing going on, and you, and you come up with all of these preset systems for trying to, you know, maintain some kind of control over the whole thing. And I went through all of this and, and I, I had even <span style="color:red" data-ts="1176.04" data-end_ts="1176.32" title="1176.04" id=c_"1176.04">__tied__</span> hardware that I was controlling outta max, that was one of my early rigs. That was awesome. That one. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1185.02" data-end_ts="1185.24" title="1185.02" id=c_"1185.02">__at__</span> the end of it all, at the end of all this whole kind of great big, huge long process, what I've ended up with is just giving up on it, <laugh> giving up on no, entirely giving up on the idea of trying to control it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>I mean, when you're playing a tennis saxophone on stage and you're in middle of a solo, the thing's like a portable sauna. And the last thing that you can really do while you're in the middle of it is open up your eyes, lift one foot off the floor, and then move it to adjust a volume pedal slightly. It's just not gonna happen. And so I started handing over control of just gradually. So I started out by, instead of, instead of a controller being an explicit modulator of, of a particular parameter, I would start, I started inventing kind of meta control. So I would say, okay, that pedal is heel is sparse, and toe is busy. And then I would do <span style="color:red" data-ts="1242.24" data-end_ts="1242.44" title="1242.24" id=c_"1242.24">__thing__</span>, then I would just let it, so I let <span style="color:red" data-ts="1244.52" data-end_ts="1244.68" title="1244.52" id=c_"1244.52">__it__</span> basically set up like a bunch of preset spaces and just walk through them basically, and let the computer decide what, how it was gonna respond. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>But I would base it on, like, I would loosely organize things, but I'd let the kind of, the final yards just be handed over. And sometimes you end up in like weird, sometimes you end up in weird places that are kind of cool. So you, you add in a snapshot button, you say, oh, I like that. So bang, while I'm in the middle of it, I can <span style="color:red" data-ts="1272.76" data-end_ts="1272.88" title="1272.76" id=c_"1272.76">__I__</span> keep that for later on. And then eventually you end up with a bunch of things where you can kind of go from one thing to the other. And at that point I started to realize that I had invented a kind of a musical partner in a way. And, and not only, and, and not only was it kind of, well, what it was, was it was actually providing me with inspiration for stuff. And, and I'm, I'm always trying to think of like how I can stop playing the same old shit every night. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>And this all of a sudden when you've got something that you didn't actually deliberately tell it to happen, and something comes out and you go, huh. And then musically you're like, oh, wow, that just kicked me off in a whole new direction. And I wouldn't have done that if that thing hadn't happened. And I'm like, oh, I love this. This is really awesome. And I own it because I invented the system, which does that. So it's sort of, it's in a way, it's like a real <span style="color:red" data-ts="1329.5" data-end_ts="1329.7" title="1329.5" id=c_"1329.5">__time__</span> version of the practice that I do in order to develop a ex, improvisation vocabulary. And, but it's, it <span style="color:red" data-ts="1336.74" data-end_ts="1336.78" title="1336.74" id=c_"1336.74">__was__</span> just happening right there. And so it just, and now now I feel like I want to go along to a gig and I wanna close the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1343.8" data-end_ts="1344.02" title="1343.8" id=c_"1343.8">__lid__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1344.02" data-end_ts="1344.14" title="1344.02" id=c_"1344.02">__of__</span> the laptop and I want to hit the go button. And that's it. That's just whatever happens, happens. And I have a chicken switch, basically. I have like, oh my God, it just blew up and everyone's face, so I need to turn it off. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, so what it sounds like then is that you actually developed systems that end up becoming your collaborators. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Yeah. Yeah. And, and this is, this is sort of, and I kind of, and I've gone in a few different directions with it. And because once I had that going in terms of digital processing, I started to think, well, that's one way of interacting in a procedural way with what's going on musically. But another way is to, is to, is to use other ways of communicating with a musician. So then I started thinking, well, if I can, if I can use an effect to change the way that a line is going, why don't I generate, score and then sight read stuff? And what about if that's, that's those, the musical notation. And that's actually ended up being part of the gig with, with Lyle was stuff that was being played was being transmitted around to other people in the band. So we had, like, Lyle would just go, he'd play, he'd play whatever, like, just go off on some chord thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>And we had a way of being able to kind of transcribe that in real time, and the rest of the bank could kind of follow him along. And so <span style="color:red" data-ts="1436.63" data-end_ts="1436.92" title="1436.63" id=c_"1436.63">__that__</span> there was this kind of, so, and I feel like it's this massive field that I really want to get into. And, and there's the huge amount of work that could be done, and I call it serial conduction. And it's about, it's about handing over decisions at like various sort of meta levels to a process. Like say you're a band, and like the simple, like a really simple way would be like randomizing the songs in a set list or, but then you can kind of like go in a little bit deeper. Like you could say, okay, so I'm gonna build, I'm gonna rehearse these different structures. I'm gonna rehearse these different <span style="color:red" data-ts="1476.3" data-end_ts="1476.52" title="1476.3" id=c_"1476.3">__set__</span> sets or parts of a musical piece, but I'm gonna have the computer tell us when they should be played. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, that makes a lot of sense. Or like having alternative bridges or whatever. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Yeah. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And have things just sort of decide for you which way you're gonna go. And then there's, there's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1494.52" data-end_ts="1494.64" title="1494.52" id=c_"1494.52">__the__</span> thing that happens that I, that I think is interesting, and it seems like you're, you kinda live in this area, which is, sort of the, I hate how often I use the phrase sort of, but it's because none of this is particularly precise, right. We're working out so many angles on this kind of stuff. Right. But, it seems to me that one of the really interesting places of kind of modern and experimental music is having a system generate some sort of material, but have it filtered by the experience of a musician or an artist having to interpret that in real time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And it seems like that's kind of exactly what you're talking about. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>I think in other, in other ways, like another, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Another kind of way of expressing the idea, so is I kind of program on a large, I instead of like programming little bits. So when I do video programming, I like, I don't like to, I don't feel attracted to the idea of, of manipulating pixels, but I absolutely love the idea of building a model of an editor so that you could have a whole bunch of clips and find like a new, a new sequence through it. I see. And so that's the, so I guess I feel that's the same way that I feel about music as well, that I don't, I don't feel hugely attracted to. I'm not, I mean, mean it goes on all the time in my rigs of like, I'm not sitting there all day trying to come up with 72 different snare drum sounds. I want to, I want play sections of stuff and I wanna play them musically, and I want that, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1617" data-end_ts="1617.2" title="1617" id=c_"1617">__wanna__</span> feel like that stuff is, is kind of being manipulated in some strange way that the Yeah. That makes any 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sense at all. Well, that's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1627.12" data-end_ts="1627.28" title="1627.12" id=c_"1627.12">__kind__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1627.28" data-end_ts="1627.32" title="1627.28" id=c_"1627.28">__of__</span>, yeah, it does. Well, and it also points to a different kind of style behind using particularly computer-based systems. Because if you think about the history of that, and you said that you sort of started working with these systems in the late, late nineties mm-hmm. <affirmative>, but I think even if you go before that, but especially with the advent of computers and computer <span style="color:red" data-ts="1650.84" data-end_ts="1651.16" title="1650.84" id=c_"1650.84">__based__</span> samplers, like giga sampler and some stuff like that mm-hmm. <affirmative>, it seemed like a lot of people took the opportunity to become, electronic, like baseball card collectors. Right? Yep. At which point it was like, you know, you might have 72 snare drum samples, but I have 72 samples of, Dr. Dre's 8 0 8. Right. You know, and that puts me, that makes me somehow culturally more advanced because I have this piece of obscurity that makes me cool. And I think some of that comes from sort of like the brag culture of the internet, but some of it also comes from the fact that things like computers tend to preference organization and collection over sort of like process and release, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Yeah. Honestly, I never felt like that. I never felt like I needed to collect baseball cards because I just spent the last 30 years playing a horn, and I know that nobody's got that <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Good point. Now, when you, let me ask you a question, because you talk about kind of the, like this long run that it, that you took in order to get where you're at today. I mean, first of all, what were some of the sort of like interim rigs? What did some of those things look like? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Well, at the very, at the beginning, at the beginning it was like a Lombard and I didn't, I was really super concerned with latency and, I didn't feel like I was able to get as much going as I wanted to. This is like late nineties. So I saved up my money for ages and ages and ages, and then still went on the even <span style="color:red" data-ts="1768.47" data-end_ts="1768.76" title="1768.47" id=c_"1768.47">__tied__</span> trip, and just got into the reverbs and the reverse delays and all of that kind of stuff. And MIDI controlled it. And so that would've been, that was kind of, that was the kind of just describe the Max Midi controlling a, an external D s P thing that would kind of like, that's the first rig. And then I think probably I was using, most of the time it's always been pretty much foot pedals because I just, I tried the buttons thing out and I, I had a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1801.54" data-end_ts="1801.76" title="1801.54" id=c_"1801.54">__tee__</span> box and I had that little button thing that you can like add into the tee box. But then I just found myself, you know, on stage with all these wires hanging off everything. And you know, it's that classic thing of, you know, you step like six inches too far to the left and the whole thing comes off the table and ends up on the floor <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>And it, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1821.1" data-end_ts="1821.32" title="1821.1" id=c_"1821.1">__oh__</span>, it's just sad. And, and, that kind of, I mean, I like to, I have to be free, you know, I have to be able to move when I'm playing. I don't know why. I just, I can't, if I'm locked still, it just, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1834.6" data-end_ts="1834.72" title="1834.6" id=c_"1834.6">__I__</span> don't know something's wrong. And, so really foot pedals is the only, I've tried all sorts of stuff. I tried sticking colored dots on the end of my horn and, and using cameras to detect, you know, position and try to do that. But it doesn't work because you stop thinking about it. Well, I mean it Okay. In terms of a noise source and stuff, I guess. But you can't actually control anything like that. I've learned that my, my ankle's not a particularly well tuned controller of any <laugh>. Maybe I could practice it like crazy to get my ankle to be better, but you have to be in exactly the same spot. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>You can't just sort of like be lurching all around the stage. So I, it's foot pedals and I use the little Roland ev, whatever they are ev pedals. Right? Yeah. And they, and they're great. And, I've had, there's been various ways that I've just plugged them in. Then after a while I started, I mean, think, then computers got like stronger and bigger and better and faster. And I started to freak out that I'd be like throwing the, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1898.4" data-end_ts="1898.84" title="1898.4" id=c_"1898.4">__Orville__</span> into a plane. And I'd think that I was gonna get off the plane and give it a shake, and I'd hear all the bits rattling around inside it, and it just worried me. So, and then I realized, you know, now laptops are kind of good. So it's just a sound card and Max, and I'm still using foot pedals, but I'm down to about one foot pedal now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Okay. And for me, and, and the other thing is I've spent ages on UIs and, you know, looking at sound metering and running, 'cause you have to run gates. 'cause they're basically, the bane, the biggest enemy of, playing a horn and manipulating it on stage in a band is, is that you have a live microphone. And in the case of a bass clarinet, you have two live microphones. And it's a complete nightmare. And it means that if you're trying to do pitch tracking, if you're trying to be able to like just cop melody <span style="color:red" data-ts="1954.49" data-end_ts="1954.84" title="1954.49" id=c_"1954.49">__lines__</span> so that you can, you are at the mercy of whatever's going on, on stage. And, I'd be in these like, really loud DJ gigs or I'd be in like a big band and like, there'd be a, you know, a Leslie sitting next to me or something, something crazy like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Oh, sure. And, and it's just, it was, it's completely hopeless. But I tried it all and, and the end for me, but just about for nobody else that I know, for me, the right thing to do is just give up and not worry about it. And if the sound of the band comes through the rig, then the sound of the band comes through the rig and it's actually kind of cool. And find ways of being able to, to deal with that. Don't be, and, and don't go out there with like a really, with a gate, with a threshold all the way up to the roof. Because that means you can only play with one dynamic, which is Right. Full on super loud. Right. Yeah. And that's just no fun at all. And so I, I kind of embrace the chaos a little bit. I, you, I find Youi really, really annoying and distracting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>So in fact, Tom Hall is a friend of ours, and he is a great evangelist on closing the lid of the laptop. And I'm, and I'm there and I don't wanna see it. I want to interact acoustically in, in like, terms of what I'm hearing with what's going on. And I find that I'm actually kind of alone. I don't find, I don't, I mean, most other people that I help with their rigs with all this sort of stuff <span style="color:red" data-ts="2041.47" data-end_ts="2041.69" title="2041.47" id=c_"2041.47">__are__</span> completely unwilling to give up control in this way. They're like, I've gotta, I've <span style="color:red" data-ts="2046.61" data-end_ts="2046.73" title="2046.61" id=c_"2046.61">__got__</span>, I've <span style="color:red" data-ts="2047.13" data-end_ts="2047.21" title="2047.13" id=c_"2047.13">__got__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2047.25" data-end_ts="2047.37" title="2047.25" id=c_"2047.25">__a__</span> place, I've gotta place what I want in exactly the spot that I wanna put on. I can't give that away because what if it's wrong? And that's just a kind of a difference in, in the way that my brain works from just about everybody else, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I think. Yeah. Well, it's, it's really interesting because I think a lot of times, particularly people who start off with acoustic instruments and then move into electronics, you know, generally it's through the, gateway drug of guitar pedals mm-hmm. <affirmative> and then move into, you know, using a computer as part of their stage rig. I always see it as people who increasingly want more and more control. Right. To the point where you end up with performers who have these big looping systems and all this kinda stuff so that they don't even have to have another person on the damn stage. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Oh, yeah. You 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Know, did you ever, did you ever mess around with loopers much? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Not so much hardware loopers. I mean, there was a few kind of looping presets in on, in the even <span style="color:red" data-ts="2112.85" data-end_ts="2113.13" title="2112.85" id=c_"2112.85">__Tide__</span> boxes, which is basically just like glorified delays. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2115.76" data-end_ts="2116.05" title="2115.76" id=c_"2115.76">__Sure__</span>. But I pretty much have always written my own loopers. I consider, I guess I would, I say I consider a looper to be equivalent to a song that, in the sense that if certain kind of functionality of a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2133.69" data-end_ts="2134.09" title="2133.69" id=c_"2133.69">__looper__</span> kind of requires you to play it sort of the same way every time in order to get it to work. So, you know, I mean, and the cliche is, is, you know, okay, now I'm gonna, I'm gonna put down a baseline. Now I'm gonna put some like hand clap back beats, and now I'm gonna put in a little comi thing, and now I'm gonna put something else on top of it. Now I'm gonna play over the top of it. Yeah. And so that <span style="color:red" data-ts="2156.71" data-end_ts="2157" title="2156.71" id=c_"2156.71">__loop__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And, and I have to tell you, man, that you just walked through that verbally, and in my head I'm hearing like this sad, funky baseline, and then the sad Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Dope. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Funky drummy <laugh>. Oh man. That's just like, you just put a sad face on the whole looping thing there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>I don't mean I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2175.4" data-end_ts="2175.56" title="2175.4" id=c_"2175.4">__know__</span> <laugh> well, it's that I, yeah. Well, maybe that's a bit unkind of me, but, I don't, that to me means that that Looper is one song. And I've always felt like loopers are songs or sections of songs, but all of my <span style="color:red" data-ts="2193.44" data-end_ts="2193.88" title="2193.44" id=c_"2193.44">__loopers__</span> that I make are all, they'll take stuff and stash it away and they'll come back and play it later. Like, I'll try and cop <span style="color:red" data-ts="2205.63" data-end_ts="2205.92" title="2205.63" id=c_"2205.63">__like__</span>, I'll try. And, I spent ages trying to recreate this, the idea of not knowing which side, like left or right, which one was the actual acoustic me, like trying to build a looper that, that delayed my playback and re-pitched it slightly so that then, but did kind of like cross fades so that I wouldn't know. So I would try and create this kind of sense of ambiguity about, which was the actual voice of mine and lupus, which would take things and then like all of a sudden, like later on in the gig, like spit them out and, and lupus, that'll just would take phrases. So I'd like do gate operated, gate operated loops and all sorts of just weird stuff. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's interesting that you say it because, I would say that, you know, again, having played with you and, and seen you use these things, when, when you talk about how how loopers are typically used, it's really sort of like an extension of a D A W where you have tracks and you just start building up tracks, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Yep. Yep. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The way that you use 'em and the way that you kind of just explained it to it reminds me of in the, the Hunger Games movies, and they have this thing called the mocking J right. Where they're running around and sonic <span style="color:red" data-ts="2289.04" data-end_ts="2289.4" title="2289.04" id=c_"2289.04">__events__</span>, these birds sort of like capture 'em all of a sudden over space or over time, you'll just hear it, hear that sound come back, and people would end up communicating with each other by making little whistle, and then the birds would eventually carry it all over the woods and people would hear it eventually, right? Mm-hmm. <affirmative> it, that seems like what you do is, is it's almost like you use looping in a very generative sense, rather than in like a constructive sense. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Yeah. I, I, I think there's a kind of, I think maybe there's even a sort of a, a kind of a classical thing there in terms of being able to create a sense of unity in a piece of music by reusing elements of it. I'm not really that interested in writing out melodies so much. I'm just more interested in creating everything on the fly. It's like, okay, so we're building a kind of a, a, a construction kit for the fact that we, we are playing on, we are playing, but we, here we can make <span style="color:red" data-ts="2355.08" data-end_ts="2355.2" title="2355.08" id=c_"2355.08">__c__</span> sections of the sound kind of have this kind of homogenous kind of thing because the things will come back and you'll hear them again. So, wow. They must have meant it. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It must have been important in some way, right? <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2368.9" data-end_ts="2369.12" title="2368.9" id=c_"2368.9">__See__</span>, they were right. <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I realize when you're talking about that, that's a lot of what you do is you kind of allow you, you set up this environment basically. Do you choose what it captures or do you let it choose for itself? Both. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Both, just, yeah, absolutely. I guess what I, I guess I've, I'm a little bit adverse to the, to the idea of, of playing something and then hearing it repeated over and over and over and over again. I, i, I don't mind playing in bands where people do that long as they don't do it for half an hour. But I just kind of, I don't, I don't do that for myself. And that apply, that's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2417.12" data-end_ts="2417.24" title="2417.12" id=c_"2417.12">__a__</span>, that's that kind of voice in my head telling me what I should sound like thing. And that applies to the way that I use effects as well. I don't want to turn on a delay and play a section with that delay just sitting there for, for a minute or even 30 seconds because, or maybe 30 seconds if it's depending on the kind of delay. But, but I feel like things just have to be constantly moving. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>They have to be changing and moving and, and, and shifting to, in order for me for it to sound right in my head, there needs to be this kind of constant sense of like organic, kind of like movement inside the thing. And so when, so I'm not sort of much attracted to kind of like, okay, now we're gonna have, you know, a couple of choruses with the big long reverb, and then I'm gonna go over and go clunk on the button and I'm gonna have something else. Now we're gonna do some distortion and all that sort of stuff. I find ways to mix them all up the whole time. So I guess that's the looping thing as well. It's like, okay, I do wanna record this. Oh wow, that thing was good that I just did quick grab it out of sample memory and then we'll use it later on. Or, okay. Just randomly, randomly kind of grab phrases and, and chop them up and re-pitch them and see what happens, happens, stuff like that. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So how can you stand playing with me since I tend to do that all the time? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Yeah, but you do it, you do <span style="color:red" data-ts="2501.48" data-end_ts="2501.6" title="2501.48" id=c_"2501.48">__it__</span>, you do it nicely. <laugh> <laugh>. No, I, I'm, I'm into it. It has to happen, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2507.18" data-end_ts="2507.4" title="2507.18" id=c_"2507.18">__and__</span> people have style. It's not about, it's not about what it is, it's about the way, it's about the way that you do it. And I, I don't have a problem with <span style="color:red" data-ts="2515.68" data-end_ts="2515.8" title="2515.68" id=c_"2515.68">__that__</span>, with people doing it all and, and, and loops and, and grooves and, and stuff that goes around and round and around is a really important part of, but I just, it's not, it's not something you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Don't want it coming outta 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>You. It's not something that I, that I want to do. I'm a, I guess I have a, I guess part of the, the sound that I have in my head for the way that I sound is a lead instrument sound. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And I don't think lead instruments are supposed to play same thing <span style="color:red" data-ts="2542.16" data-end_ts="2542.4" title="2542.16" id=c_"2542.16">__around__</span> and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2542.72" data-end_ts="2542.84" title="2542.72" id=c_"2542.72">__around__</span> and 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Repeating around and around rage it, that kind of shortcuts the question I was just going to ask, which is that people who tend to get into effects and processing and stuff like that, a lot of times are trying to get around limitations of their instrument and make their instrument be more like a different instrument. So the, the classic thing, and I think, everyone, everyone can buy into this is you had like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2571.02" data-end_ts="2571.24" title="2571.02" id=c_"2571.02">__Jan__</span> Hamer, do <span style="color:red" data-ts="2573.08" data-end_ts="2573.24" title="2573.08" id=c_"2573.08">__it__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2573.24" data-end_ts="2573.48" title="2573.24" id=c_"2573.24">__make__</span> trying his best to make his keyboard playing sound like a sloppy guitarist. Right. While simultaneously you have Robert Fripp trying his best to make the sloppy guitarist sound as precise as a keyboard. Right. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Yep. Yep. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And, you know, they both use whatever technologies and techniques they can to make their thing sound like a thing. It's not mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And did you ever feel like that was part of the quest, or, I mean, especially as a horn player, you never had polyphony on your side? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>No. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Was effects and delay systems and stuff like that, a way to get some of that? Or did you just, or did you never think of it that way? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Pretty much, I think I, I've never just had an effect like, okay, I'm gonna layer an effect or a sound with the horn to make a bigger sounding horn, I think. And there was one, no, I've never done it. Well sort of, kind of done it maybe a couple of times, but then I'll make the sound, I'll modulate the sound while it's going along. But I've al I just always think about sounds as counterpoint to what I'm, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2647.5" data-end_ts="2647.72" title="2647.5" id=c_"2647.5">__for__</span> the sound of what I'm doing. Oh, sure. Okay. It's just, it's always, it's always something. Maybe it, maybe it makes it sound different because of the way that it's in, you know, opposition or, I, but yeah, I, yeah, I don't think about, okay, I'm just gonna play some fuzz clarinet here, although that could be kind of cool, but <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now that you see it <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Yeah. You can be fuzzy on the clarinet without needing a distortion pedal. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Something. Yeah. But I'll, and I do love using distortion, but every now, well, you know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, but you, I mean, the thing that I would say about you and using the way that you use electronics is I never feel like I'm listening to the sound of the electronics. I feel like I'm listening to you, and there just happens to be some electronics flopped on it, which I guess is saying an awful lot because there's an awful lot of people that I don't feel that way about, you know, I feel like when I hear them, I'm hearing electronics and Oh, they happen to be controlling it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2710.79" data-end_ts="2711.08" title="2710.79" id=c_"2710.79">__Well__</span>, thank you. That's a, that is a, that's a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2713.4" data-end_ts="2713.52" title="2713.4" id=c_"2713.4">__cool__</span>, I mean, one of the things that I, I always wanted to try and do is in fact create a sense of, of ambiguity. Like where does the acoustic horn stop and the electronics start? And when <span style="color:red" data-ts="2726.14" data-end_ts="2726.36" title="2726.14" id=c_"2726.14">__it__</span>, and I feel like when I'm not doing a good job of it, there's this difference. There's clarinet or the saxophone or whatever, and then there's some squeaky sounds. Right. Right. And that's, that's on a bad day. And on a good day is when like, I don't even, I don't even realize what's going on. Don't even, don't even have any idea that there's a difference and it just flows. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So one of the things you and I have talked about in the past that I would like to talk about a little now in front of people is the idea of practice in this kind of context. Oh 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>'cause it's not like practice is getting to be incredibly fast at playing, dorian's dorian mode scale. Right, right. Practice ends up being a different thing, which is kind of learning to be fast on your feet in the privacy of your own home, maybe. I mean, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2779.86" data-end_ts="2780.08" title="2779.86" id=c_"2779.86">__at__</span>, that's one of the ways I think of it. You practice doing things that could happen in performance so that whatever happens, performance you can sort of deal. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Right? Yeah. It's, yeah, you practice at home and you try and give yourself stuff that you can do, and you hope that you can remember how to do some of it when you're on stage or you hope it works out or you hope you can get close to it, or you hope that you've practiced it enough at home so that you've internalized it a little bit so that you don't suck. You know, like you don't, you, you have something that 'cause your brain just goes blank and you, you're just playing something and you hope that your practice is kind of concreted in enough so that that thing that you just fall back on is actually cool. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>How would you say that your practice translates into gigs? I mean, do you find that, that when you actually play <span style="color:red" data-ts="2837.04" data-end_ts="2837.16" title="2837.04" id=c_"2837.04">__a__</span> gig that you're doing half as much stuff as you do in practice? Or is there not that kind of a contextual match? You know, I would say that for myself, you know, I do a lot of practice and particularly like with the modular system now, you know, doing a lot of practice where I just sort of like randomly patch together a thing. It's like, okay, how do I make this sound cool? Because oftentimes in performance I'll be patching something and shit, maybe I patched it wrong or something, or maybe I got a wild hair up my nose and I patch up a thing that I think is gonna be cool and it really sounds like, you know, a sick horse. Right. And now I have to find, I wanna find a way to make that still work. Right. Since I went through all the process of patching it. Right. I mean that's, but I, I find that when I go to play gig, I tend to roll back the amount of adventurousness just because it doesn't seem, I mean, it seems like I, if I don't do that, I'm kind of not honoring the audience a little bit. But maybe that's strong-headed. I don't know. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>I don't know. Well, I think that you've got pretty massive modular synth chops. You're just kind of in a bit of a different place because you, I mean, the other thing is you start out with no patch cables and you, you're actually capable of, you have enough fluency on the thing where whereby you can go to something pretty quickly like that. And I feel like for me, the two instruments that I play, well, if I'm taking a synth out or something, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2928.06" data-end_ts="2928.28" title="2928.06" id=c_"2928.06">__and__</span> then I have a horn, I practice them in completely different ways. I practice the horn in a kind of an almost by the numbers kind of a way. I practice patterns and, you know, slim lipski and all that kind of stuff. And I'm just like trying to work my fingers out and just trying to get my head into like a kind of a neutral space and trying to practice as much generalized things as possible, because I know I'm just gonna play the horn at the gig and whatever seems appropriate at the time is gonna be the thing that I'm gonna play. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>So I sort of, I'm just trying to clean the blackboard sort of thing and make my fingers work. That's the horn. But for the synth, I'm prac, I feel like I'm just sort of groping around in the dark a little bit with it. And I'm practicing <span style="color:red" data-ts="2970.46" data-end_ts="2970.68" title="2970.46" id=c_"2970.46">__as__</span> sort of halfway between, you know, remembering which hole to plug the thing into <laugh> and finding which sound actually might work for this for a situation that's coming up. So, it's a, it's kind of fun having a, it <span style="color:red" data-ts="2985.08" data-end_ts="2985.12" title="2985.08" id=c_"2985.08">__is__</span> kind of fun having a new instrument. It's kind of fun having a new instrument that you can explore and kind of go back to being kind of useless on again. Well, it's not that fun at all actually, but, <laugh> <laugh>. But I definitely don't feel like I need to practice the, the, the, the D s P side of things because of it. Because its nature is generative. It just, it just sort of comes out what it is. So that's just sitting down with the max patch and the headphones on singing into the laptop, and like coming up with new little ideas for this, new little ideas for that. And maybe they'll turn up on, on the bandstand or not. Do you feel 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Like with the D S P systems though, that you still need to practice it just so that if you do put it, bring it up on the bandstand and it starts squirting out stuff that you know how to deal with it? Yeah. Or do you feel like you're adept enough at the instruments so that <span style="color:red" data-ts="3037.04" data-end_ts="3037.24" title="3037.04" id=c_"3037.04">__ju__</span> that just comes along with it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>There've definitely been gigs where I will just go, oh, wow, this is not working. Okay. Just close the lid, turn it off and play acoustic. Mm-hmm. And I'm so grateful that I can, well, you know, it's just, it's the go-to. I I can do that. I can, I don't worry about that sort of situation happening. There's, that's absolutely happened. And, and yeah. And a lot of, a lot of practice is, is like you say, fluency in mechanically being able to get things going. Right. And, you know, does, if <span style="color:red" data-ts="3067.52" data-end_ts="3067.64" title="3067.52" id=c_"3067.52">__I__</span>, if I string this up this way, you know, you see it, a lot of, you see a lot of the time when, especially people like you say, with with, you know, 10, 10, 15, 20 guitar pedals and they all like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3078.84" data-end_ts="3079" title="3078.84" id=c_"3078.84">__they__</span> need to explicitly con control it and stuff like that. And you can see people on stage struggling to go, struggling to go from one state and their rig to the next. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>They've got, you can see they've got an idea in their head and they, but they lack the interface to be able to make the jump. And that's quick enough. Right. And I think that this, I think this is the sort of the challenge when it comes to developing onstage systems. I, and I actually, and I think about it with the people that I work with. I mean, I think, I think about, okay, how can we, how can we try and optimize by making the shortest distance possible between every known state of this rig? How can we get from one place to any other place in this rig with two mouse clicks or mm-hmm. <affirmative> or, you know, two gestures over here. Because that, and that sort of plays into <span style="color:red" data-ts="3137" data-end_ts="3137.12" title="3137" id=c_"3137">__a__</span> sense of creative freedom, you know, especially for people in a slightly improvised context. They, they get a wild idea in the head. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>And it's, and it's like, it's the same thing as facility on an instrument. You get an idea and you head, you hear a melody <span style="color:red" data-ts="3150.84" data-end_ts="3151.04" title="3150.84" id=c_"3150.84">__in__</span> your head, and it's like, practices, what makes that practices, what makes that idea into a reality. The more you practice, the more likely it is, you're actually gonna be able to make that thing happen. And so I think this applies in the same way to the way that you set out a D S P system on stage. You want to be able to, you think about it and the practices practice is almost like the way that you design it so that you can realize the ideas on it instantly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Wow. That's, that's a cool perspective because, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>I never thought of that before <laugh>. No, I didn't. Me either. I guess I, I guess I, I think that all the time, but I never sort of put it in those words. But yeah, that is actually what 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I <span style="color:red" data-ts="3196.56" data-end_ts="3196.64" title="3196.56" id=c_"3196.56">__think__</span> well <span style="color:red" data-ts="3196.68" data-end_ts="3196.84" title="3196.68" id=c_"3196.68">__think__</span>. Well, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3196.88" data-end_ts="3196.96" title="3196.88" id=c_"3196.88">__because__</span> we're talking about a lot of stuff that nobody ever really wants to verbalize. Because there's something about saying, you know, first of all, if you are practicing a lot of times unlike, you know, running your scales or whatever, you have no idea if the practice that you're doing has any relationship to what you're actually gonna do in a gig. You know, it's, it's hard to know. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Yeah, yeah, yeah. It is. It is. But <span style="color:red" data-ts="3221.2" data-end_ts="3221.32" title="3221.2" id=c_"3221.2">__the__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The other thing is, I think there's an awful lot of people that just don't talk about this because they never practice it. And some of the struggle you're talking about seeing on the stage is the fact that, you know, hey, every time I play at home, I'm doing it for fun. So I turn on this distortion, followed by this reverb, followed by this delay. Right. And that's how I play at home because it's fun. And now I'm at a gig and oh crap. You know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And I think nobody wants to actually admit that that's a part of their playing that they never practice 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>And you see, and, and on a gig and also, you know, with somebody else Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>If you play with someone that's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="3262.28" data-end_ts="3262.64" title="3262.28" id=c_"3262.28">__Struggling__</span> and that's, yeah. And that's another, that's another thing I think is something that you kind of can't practice at home by yourself. And that is understanding about the density of what it is that you're doing when placed in the context of, you know, one or more other people who are also maybe doing that kind of thing. And, and I think, and to be able to, 'cause I think a lot of the time, the criticism that I would have of stage, regs where there's a whole lot going on is that you get guys who've got their shit all worked out and they've got these sounds that they want to do, and then everybody in the band is doing that and it goes to mud in like about one second. And so the, i that, that the idea of being able to sort of lighten it up and, and play in band settings, I guess it's just like, like a usual musical thing that people, people would do. But, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But it's a little different because back in the day when everyone had a modest, you know, could only make a modest amount of sound or only eat up a modest amount of the frequency range. Right. There was by definition room for the bass player to play while the guitar player was playing. Right. Right. Now we each have the ability to fully max out the entire frequency space. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And it seems like people are all in a rush to do exactly that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>And it's, yeah. And if you go <span style="color:red" data-ts="3349.08" data-end_ts="3349.24" title="3349.08" id=c_"3349.08">__in__</span> and, that happened to be, I remember being in bands with older, with older gentlemen, <laugh> when I first started bringing the rig along and the bass player would be like, dude, get out of my space. <laugh>. Like, go away. Right, right. Like, you're not, and I don't want you down here. It's Yeah. Like, go away. You don't exist here. You are wrecking my shit. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Yeah. Really interesting. Alright, well one of the things that you just talked about there was this idea of setting up other people's rigs to kind of work, in real time. And I know that that's something you do. You've, you've worked on putting together touring rigs for people other than the ability to like really switch in and out of functions really quickly. What are the things that you find that are the most significant, the, the significant, most significant things to consider when you're doing like large scale, stage rigs 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>In, in my experience of working on stuff that's commercially up and running and touring and all of that kind of thing. The one thing that was the biggest shock to me, you know, coming from like, you know, puddling around doing jazz gigs and stuff like that is the rate of attrition of gear. And it's absolutely amazing how stuff breaks down. And so, in fact <span style="color:red" data-ts="3445.67" data-end_ts="3445.79" title="3445.67" id=c_"3445.67">__I__</span> kind of, I probably, when I'm writing, rigs for people who are, you know, touring for months on end and stuff like that, I probably would say that just about half of the effort that I'm putting in is putting in bumper bars and what happens if <span style="color:red" data-ts="3462.99" data-end_ts="3463.19" title="3462.99" id=c_"3462.99">__it__</span> this goes down and what happens if that goes down and how do we, how do we have a scalable rig so that if all of these other parts fall off it, we still have a corner of it that is completely bombproof that will do something 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>And the, that there's definitely a, a huge chasm between being able to get something to work in somebody's studio and for them to be able to pull it out of the truck at some gig and be able to throw it up in 45 minutes of soundcheck and be be banging it that night. It's, it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="3501.9" data-end_ts="3502.19" title="3501.9" id=c_"3501.9">__just__</span> the most challenging part of it. It's really, it's really interesting. You can have all of these kind of ideas about, about what amazing things that you're gonna be able to do. But if it involves, I've learned to, to completely get rid of fragility as much as possible. Just try and, and stuff has gotta be really tight in order to be able to build these things for, you know, commercial, commercial situations. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well I was wondering, to what extent does that also include simplifying it so that it's easy to work with when you're on stage? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>When I'm working for, when I'm working for somebody else, people have kind of different relationships with their rigs. <laugh> <laugh> they do. And some people, some people are all over it and know it all back backwards and everything like that. And some other people, other people are kind of like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3554.01" data-end_ts="3554.23" title="3554.01" id=c_"3554.01">__oh__</span>, how does this work again? And simplification, simplification I think in all situations is, is something that should be kept in mind. 'cause you, you just give yourself, I mean simplification, but flexibility, you just, it just means that, you know, there's less to forget. And a lot of the, a lot of the time I think, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3576.2" data-end_ts="3576.4" title="3576.2" id=c_"3576.2">__and__</span> just about everybody I know who has built a customized, D S P on stage rig, if you ask them to use the one they made last week, they'd forget how it worked. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, right. Yeah. Well, but this also, this also seems though to kind of align with your personal philosophies of the rigs that you use, which is this idea that you have, you know, you've simplified it to the point that a foot pedal to heel side means sparse and the Yeah, yeah, yeah. Toe side means dent and that's something that's easy to remember from gig to gig. And it's easy to remember even if you're sweating bullets at a gig. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Right. I I would say that simplicity is sort of, is the, yeah, it's like the number one virtue of a, of A D S P rig. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So do you see there any new technology coming along that's going to sort of help with the whole live performance interface? You know, I'm just thinking, I mean, there's been some things that, that were tantalizing that to me haven't worked out yet. So for example, like the leap motion Oh my gosh. Which it, it's so tantalizing except when you actually try and music use it for musical significance, it's sort of like, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Or when you try and hold your arm up in the middle mid <span style="color:red" data-ts="3655.18" data-end_ts="3655.4" title="3655.18" id=c_"3655.18">__for__</span> longer than about two minutes. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>It's Yeah, everybody, everybody wants the minority report, user interface. But if you actually try it, it sucks. Yeah. Because your arms just start hurting straight away. I, for me, for me, the, the thing that I want to, the thing I think is gonna be really cool is when we can build a, like a single system on a single computer that can run D S P <span style="color:red" data-ts="3689.56" data-end_ts="3689.72" title="3689.56" id=c_"3689.56">__and__</span> looping and everything for every member of the band that's gonna be, and then everybody has their own interface to it. And I think that way we're gonna be able to, really, unlock a potential for, for, for synchronicity. And 'cause I find that this, I find that this stuff works best when there's a sense of when things happen at the same time, you know, different events occur and they might, might not be the same sound or whatever, but when there's this sort of like people doing things at the same time and they have, that's when, that's how you can get meaning. That's how you can make like chaotic d s p stuff sound like it has a purpose within the music that you're playing. And I think that now that we've got these much more sort of full on computers and everything like that, the idea that we could make songs that are kind of like a central brain of, of a band, that's, that's gonna be really cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That's pretty interesting because right now all of these kind of systems really are individual. There's nothing ensemble oriented about any of 'em. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Right. And you've just got this massive clocking problem's like, how do we get everybody on the same beat? And it's, it's just like nobody seems to have got even close to being able to sort that one out. And maybe people don't <span style="color:red" data-ts="3772" data-end_ts="3772.2" title="3772" id=c_"3772">__wanna__</span> play to click the whole time, but sometimes they might. And if you have a machine in the middle of it all, then you can, you can do all that and you can have people just with their own little section of it. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Really interesting. Well, Andrew, boy we burned through that hour in a hurry, <laugh>, that was, that's something, really interesting stuff and I appreciate you kinda like diving into, like, trying to verbalize some of the things that, that are sort of like rattling around in your head. That's really cool. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Yeah, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thank you. Thank you so much for your time and have a great week. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Cheers mate. Go back, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Go back and another podcast in the bank. Number 55. Thanks to Andrew for spending the time talking to us, especially <span style="color:red" data-ts="3823.52" data-end_ts="3823.72" title="3823.52" id=c_"3823.52">__that__</span> thing about practice is pretty awesome. So, hope that you found it as interesting as I did. Thanks. Go out again to everybody that, helps out with podcasts as well as everyone that listens. And also I just wanna say if you haven't, taken a look at Max seven yet, we just got that pushed out and it's pretty awesome. So, take a look if you have a chance. Finally, take, also take a look at the podcast website, which is art, music tech, all one word. Dot libsyn, L I B S Y n.com. Andrew provided us a link so that you can listen to some of his squiggly music. Hopefully you'll find something inspiring that as well. Otherwise, thanks a lot for listening and we <span style="color:red" data-ts="3872.16" data-end_ts="3872.24" title="3872.16" id=c_"3872.16">__will__</span> catch you next time around. Bye.
