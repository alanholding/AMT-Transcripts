<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, this week I have the pleasure of introducing you to somebody that I've gotten to know over the last couple of months. He's been working with, Andrew Paska, myself, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_%2774">Cycling '74</a> team dealing with the code base of Max. He's been a fantastic guy to work with, but he also does a lot of incredible work in the real world, and I really wanted to get a chance to talk to him about his stuff. His name is David Butler He has one of the coolest website names ever, which is the impersonal stereo.com. That's where you can find out more information about him, but we're going to learn a little bit about him today and talk to him about his work. So with that, I'm gonna say hi to David. Hi, David. How's it going? 
</p>

<p>
<b>David Butler: </b>Hello. Good to be here. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thank you so much for taking time outta your schedule. I know you're really hella busy right now. You're, you're in London at the moment, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Well, in London right now. I live in London, most of the time, but, spend a, a good proportion of, of its, in various places working on projects. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So you're you're <span style="color:red" data-ts="74.445" data-end_ts="74.525" title="74.445" id=c_"74.445">__a__</span> hotel guy. Some, huh? 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Yeah, a <span style="color:red" data-ts="76.485" data-end_ts="76.565" title="76.485" id=c_"76.485">__lot__</span>. A lot of hotels, a lot of, trying to find a, you know, decent restaurant and <span style="color:red" data-ts="80.245" data-end_ts="80.405" title="80.245" id=c_"80.245">__then__</span> <laugh> <span style="color:red" data-ts="81.065" data-end_ts="81.285" title="81.065" id=c_"81.065">__in__</span> the vicinity. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. So why don't you, why don't we kick this off by having you tell us a little bit about the work that you're doing? 'cause I find it pretty fascinating. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Yeah. So I'm like, I would say I like a video guy primarily, and that's, and that's my kind of professional side and also partly my academic background, but that's always a little bit more <span style="color:red" data-ts="105.205" data-end_ts="105.405" title="105.205" id=c_"105.205">__wide__</span> ranging. But my, in my day job, I work for a company called, green Hippo. We make what, we call, media servers. That's tends to be like a word that's kind of a little confusing to, unless you're directly in the entertainment industry, but in the entertainment industry, what we, call a media server is essentially just a specialized computer for doing live video playback and processing, usually controlled, kind of like, it was a, a complicated kind of light. It's all about like, kind of live video playback processing, <span style="color:red" data-ts="136.505" data-end_ts="136.725" title="136.505" id=c_"136.505">__and__</span>, you know, kind of, so that's used on like, like live, live gigs. And actually I do a lot of integration work in kind of installations in theme parks and things like that, theater. So it's, it's all about like, about processing video live, playing back, sometimes taking kind of live inputs or doing generative stuff. I work for them doing projects, installations, and working a bit on the software side as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. This is kind of interesting because to me, you hit on something that for a long time I've, I've wondered if it was going to be a thing, which is the use of live video as sort of an alternative or maybe an adjunct to lighting, to lighting systems, <span style="color:red" data-ts="178.315" data-end_ts="178.805" title="178.315" id=c_"178.315">__because__</span> it seems almost natural, but for a long time I think projectors just weren't up to the job, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Yeah, it's, it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="186.085" data-end_ts="186.205" title="186.085" id=c_"186.085">__the__</span> interesting kind of collision was where from, again, it's, I, I mean a <span style="color:red" data-ts="189.925" data-end_ts="190.125" title="189.925" id=c_"189.925">__lot__</span>, my background is a lot in, in theater, and that's kind of where I came into, came into this industry. And it was interesting to see how specifically in theater video and the idea of the video department evolved, and it, it happened differently in different institutions depending on the kind of work they were doing, but in, in some places it kind of came out of lighting, and it's like video and video's treated like it's a complicated, it's a complicated kind of light <laugh> and in, and in some places, which tend to be the places that were doing more, more that were doing some video work initially with kind of where it was just about like, you know, connecting up DVD players or, you know, no computer stuff at all. And it's just like literally routing signals around that. They treated it much more as something that was part of the sound departments, because in terms of the actual work that was being done, it was most similar to that. And that was, it's, you know, so it's more like the AV side or like the, the lighting video side. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That's interesting. So which side did you feel more com do you feel more comfortable with? 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>I, I definitely come from the, the, from the lighting side, because that was how I, that <span style="color:red" data-ts="254.605" data-end_ts="254.685" title="254.605" id=c_"254.605">__was__</span>, that was my initial kind of stuff I did from a third perspective, I, I prefer that approach because it's, it's much more concerned <span style="color:red" data-ts="262.645" data-end_ts="262.725" title="262.645" id=c_"262.645">__of__</span>, if you think about the difference between what you're <span style="color:red" data-ts="265.845" data-end_ts="265.925" title="265.845" id=c_"265.845">__just__</span> doing when you're doing like sound design or lighting design with sound design, most of the time you're creating a, a wave file, you're creating a waveform, you're gonna, you're gonna finish that, get it how you want, and then you're gonna save it to disc. And then during the show it's just gonna be played back. So you're doing your sound design kind of offline in a lot of <span style="color:red" data-ts="283.485" data-end_ts="283.605" title="283.485" id=c_"283.485">__cases__</span>. I mean, sometimes you might be, if you're getting more complicated, you might be mixing things together, like live and, you know, balancing stuff. But mostly it's about like, you know, taking, making pre-rendered stuff Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>And, and, and playing it back. Whereas lighting is entirely, I mean, you've got fixed lighting fixtures. You're gonna put them in a position, in a venue, and then you're gonna try to build the show from that position. So you can't come with anything besides maybe some, some idea of what the programming is like, but it's gonna have to vary. So lighting in a sense is that's, it's doing it live. You are, you <span style="color:red" data-ts="317.325" data-end_ts="317.365" title="317.325" id=c_"317.325">__are__</span>, when you go into the, into a venue and you program the light show, you are creating everything there. It's, it's specific for that thing. And there's a concept of a pre-rendered lighting show. It's all or every instruction's being executed in real time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>That, that second way is, is one of the things I feel strongly about is the way to, is the way to do flexible shows and the way to be, to be more creative in a sense. And I've been, a lot of my work is about taking that approach and trying to apply and trying to see how we can apply it to, to video design, to, and to, and to sound design as well in the same sense of saying, well, we don't have to have everything rendered and, and ready and just, just, you don't have to just have a show that's based around playback. You <span style="color:red" data-ts="359.565" data-end_ts="359.605" title="359.565" id=c_"359.565">__can__</span> have a show that's based around manipulating things live and, you know, and if you know, you, you do a show and you go, you know, I want, I wanna move that, I want to change the level of that sound, I wanna change the quality of that sound. You can go in, tweak some parameters and do that without having to like, create a whole new static kind of monolithic file you've got. It's, it's something that's flexible. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, what it also seems like too is then you end up kind of a modern version of the conductor and the pit orchestra all at one, all as one, except you're dealing with media content instead of a bunch of musicians, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Yeah, exactly. Yeah. It's, it's like, yeah, that's a good analogy. In fact, the, yeah, the, you are the, you are the conductor, you know, for any, for any media for not just for sound, but for the conductor, for the video, the light show, the, the audio. Yeah. And like, you know, in traditional, traditional pit orchestras Yeah. You'd never, we started recording sound because it meant, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="417.105" data-end_ts="417.325" title="417.105" id=c_"417.105">__in__</span> for limitations where we couldn't or couldn't afford to employ an orchestra. Right. It was a way to do the same thing, but Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, if you could instead have, have virtual musicians, in fact, that would be, give you more flexibility in that sense. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That would be ideal right now 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>To apply that, the, the kind of concept of okay, for stuff that it wouldn't possible to be performed with a musician. <span style="color:red" data-ts="437.905" data-end_ts="438.125" title="437.905" id=c_"437.905">__All__</span> right. More modern kind of electronics sound design concepts where, you know, it's not just, you couldn't equate it to a person playing an instrument. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So for people that aren't used to these show control environments, what does the tooling look like? I mean, when you sit down, you know, up in the booth getting ready for a show, what's sitting in front of you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>So say that from, from a, from a lighting console <span style="color:red" data-ts="461.415" data-end_ts="461.765" title="461.415" id=c_"461.415">__point__</span> perspective, how that would work. You. So you, you start off, the first thing you do is you say, okay, well I've got all my, these various lighting fixtures you put in addressing information <span style="color:red" data-ts="471.605" data-end_ts="471.765" title="471.605" id=c_"471.605">__over__</span> them, and you set up the basic communication, and then it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="475.275" data-end_ts="475.565" title="475.275" id=c_"475.275">__that__</span> you'll usually kind of then plot, you start off by plotting in various kind of base looks or whatever you would go, you would go from and that. And at that point, then you're probably getting into the show, and then you'll, you know, you, you, you go through the show gradually <span style="color:red" data-ts="488.605" data-end_ts="489.005" title="488.605" id=c_"488.605">__change__</span>, make changes, see how things actually look. It's very kind of responsive environment because it's entirely based on you being actually in the place, looking at the result and going through it with, in context of the rest of the show. And now is true as much for, for video as well. On most shows, video is also programmed using a lighting console. And again, you're treating the, the video system. Like it's a, like, it's a very complicated light in a sense. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, that's interesting. I didn't realize that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Yeah, and it's, and that's really because the lighting consoles, yeah. It's like in a sense, you know, they're designed for controlling lighting instruments. But really, and this is something that I did a lot of research on partly when I was doing my masters, is this idea of just a thing for, for doing show control, a a a show control programmer that was more generalized in a sense. You're just taking, you're taking parameters and you're applying a, a sort of sequencing to them. And in, in the <span style="color:red" data-ts="542.285" data-end_ts="542.525" title="542.285" id=c_"542.285">__consult__</span> in <span style="color:red" data-ts="542.805" data-end_ts="543.045" title="542.805" id=c_"542.805">__life__</span> consult terms, that's more normally a <span style="color:red" data-ts="544.805" data-end_ts="545.045" title="544.805" id=c_"544.805">__queue__</span> based sequencing parameter <span style="color:red" data-ts="546.405" data-end_ts="546.605" title="546.405" id=c_"546.405">__of__</span> saying, this happens, <span style="color:red" data-ts="547.225" data-end_ts="547.445" title="547.225" id=c_"547.225">__or__</span> this queue, and in this queue this parameter fades up and fades down and does does this and other stuff. But I've been actually looking at the kind of that idea of how can you take that concept and just say, well, what I'm controlling isn't a light, maybe it's audio, maybe it's, maybe it's video, maybe it's like something physical. And because they're all, you know, ultimately may be dealing with, you know, different, different actual, things in different areas. But really the control is all, you're doing the same thing. It's all just numbers. You're equating everything to numbers changing over time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. So then these media servers that you create, these are just like computing or playback devices that somehow can respond to, what the lighting console is able to put out. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Yeah. So, I mean, lighting consoles traditionally use, DMX based protocols. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> right now it's more normally DMX over, DMX protocols that are IP based. So things like <span style="color:red" data-ts="602.225" data-end_ts="602.445" title="602.225" id=c_"602.225">__Art__</span> Met and, SACM, but it's the same information and it's a really simple protocol, which is just like 512 abit numbers. So there's actually a lot more primitive than even stuff in the, like, you more maybe used <span style="color:red" data-ts="614.085" data-end_ts="614.245" title="614.085" id=c_"614.085">__to__</span> in the audio world, like OSC or Right. Midi <span style="color:red" data-ts="617.505" data-end_ts="617.725" title="617.505" id=c_"617.505">__in__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="617.725" data-end_ts="617.845" title="617.725" id=c_"617.725">__that__</span> there's no kind of different, <span style="color:red" data-ts="619.305" data-end_ts="619.525" title="619.305" id=c_"619.305">__in__</span> different kinds of messages. You literally just send numbers at a frame rate. It's very primitive. It's one of my, in fact, one of my biggest bug bears is that in, in, you know, this protocol was invented in like the mid eighties. Right. And in all the, all the time we have not managed to create anything better, which is universally supported, but, . Unreal <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So you also mentioned that you get involved in some of the coding and some of the programming aspects of this. What kind of coding work is involved in, in bringing this stuff together? 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>I do a lot of coding obviously at, at work and as kind of my own personal projects. I'm, I'm interested in making stuff for the, the kind of things I'm interested in. Like, which the purposes of, of show control and for creating like, interfaces for, to enable kind of creativity in those aims at work. It's a lot of kind of stuff that's more, you know, utility based. Like we need the, we need the, for this, for an upcoming project, we might need to speak to a particular piece of equipment. So I'll write something to enable that. Right, right. I don't really get so much into the kind of heavy graphics part because that's <span style="color:red" data-ts="685.995" data-end_ts="686.285" title="685.995" id=c_"685.995">__like__</span>, like that's where it starts to go a little over my head. The, the interface and the kind of communication side of it is where I'm, <span style="color:red" data-ts="692.935" data-end_ts="693.285" title="692.935" id=c_"692.935">__where__</span> what I'm interested in. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I think the first time that you and I ran across each other was when I was doing some work on the, JITT cell block object in Max, and you were kind of using that as a tool for doing like, some pretty massive switching or something. As I recall. It seemed like, one of the things I noticed was the way that you were talking about it was that you were talking in terms of relatively massive scope in comparison to most people I talked to. When you're, when you're putting together a show of some significant size, how many devices are you actually working with 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>It? It depends very much on the project video in terms of, compared to like more traditional lighting stuff, video tends to start eating up the channels in a DMX term. So like in, you know, 512 universes, sorry, five 12 channels on a, on, on DMX is one universe, and like a mid, you know, a midsize show might use, you know, just with, with just lights, maybe kind of three, four universes. It depends on if they're using kind of moving lights. If they, if they're using just normal like dimmers, just single channel stuff, then only, probably only one. Okay. But moving lights tend to eat up more than that. Like, you know, kind of 30, 40 even more and, and more if, depending on their complexity per 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Light. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Yeah. Video video servers, tend to go way above that because then we, I mean, for a start, because we do everything, all our control is, is ethernet based as opposed to like serial cables, we're not restricted on the amount of data that can be sent to us. Right. It's more just a kind of licensing restriction on for the, because the, the, the cheaper consoles can only send so much data at once. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> as that kind of software licensing. So then <span style="color:red" data-ts="794.805" data-end_ts="795.085" title="794.805" id=c_"794.805">__well__</span>, we'll go into, like, if you've got, like, you're trying to do a video server with, 16 layers, then each, each layer might be 90 channels. So then it gets, it adds up pretty quickly if you start to then do pixel mapping based stuff where you are using a video signal to drive the colors of lights in a kind of <span style="color:red" data-ts="814.105" data-end_ts="814.325" title="814.105" id=c_"814.105">__via__</span>, via DMX. So you're not outputting a video signal, you're outputting a DMX signal, then that gets, can, gets really crazy because essentially you've then got like three, four channels for every light. And you might have, I think the biggest project I've done so far was about 800 universes. Oh 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>My God. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Yeah. And they actually cabled every single one of those individually. That was quite funny. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Man, 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That's, that's one of those where you probably just end up imagining, you know, like you're dreaming of cables all night every night. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Yeah. I wasn't, I wasn't on site for that one. I was good for you. But I saw the racks that they built that was just doing this conversion from ethernet to serial DMX. It was, yeah. It was insane. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's wild. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Troubleshooting the cables for that one. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Unreal. So I'm curious now, because you, you've kind of opened a little bit of an insight into the kind of broad range of interests and kinda capabilities that you have, but I'm really curious, one of the things I like doing <span style="color:red" data-ts="872.845" data-end_ts="873.045" title="872.845" id=c_"872.845">__in__</span> my podcast is kind of exploring how people came to become the artists that they are. Right? How they got involved in the technology, how they got involved, involved in the art side, where their passions lie. I'm, I'm always really curious about that. And you're doing a really big variety of stuff and also kind of in the neck of the woods that I don't normally, I don't normally talk to people from, from there. So I'm curious for you, what is your background and how did you get to the point where you felt like this was your passion, this was your place? 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>I was originally, when I was probably about 16, I was kind of got interested in sound and audio recording. I always had like, you know, kind of computing based interests and I was a musician, so that kind of seemed like a natural combination of the two, those two areas. So I did, did a lot of sound recording, did a lot of engineering, and I was going to, to university to, to study that. And I then in between, I did a summer job at the, Edinburgh Fringe Festival, you know, thinking it's, you know, I can, they, they, there's a lot of live sound mixing, et cetera. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> I'm involved with that. I thought, oh, this <span style="color:red" data-ts="943.005" data-end_ts="943.085" title="943.005" id=c_"943.005">__would__</span> be, you know, something, something to do over the summer and could be <span style="color:red" data-ts="946.285" data-end_ts="946.445" title="946.285" id=c_"946.285">__inter__</span> interesting in terms of getting some experience. What I discovered there at that, that summer was that sound for theater in particular is really, really dull <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>So I've, I've always been interested in, in like the live side of the live side of things as opposed to the, the recording side of things more. And so, you know, but for a lot of theater shows, you literally, you know, like you see, <span style="color:red" data-ts="970.785" data-end_ts="971.005" title="970.785" id=c_"970.785">__the__</span>, you, it was like the lighting guy sitting next to me and they'll, they, you know, the, the shows come in and they say, they roll up to him with a <span style="color:red" data-ts="976.645" data-end_ts="976.765" title="976.645" id=c_"976.645">__Q__</span> list and say, all right, we need you to program this, this, and this. And he's like, we've got this, have this massive long conversation about it. And I'm sat next to him and the audio guy comes up to me and hands me a CD and says, right tracks one to 10, <laugh>, you play them at these times in the show <laugh>. And so, as a result of that, I started to get more and more into the lighting side of things and was like, and by the end of that kind of month and a half was really like, it got fairly up to speed on that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>And then I carried on with that. Once I got to university, the, the, I went to, I went to, Lancaster University by the way. And it, the course there was, it was a music technology, but it was very, very composition focused. So we were using, we were using Max primarily. I'd already, I already knew Max from bits and pieces that I'd done. It was very open and, you know, you could, all the coursework was based around kind of, you know, making some sort of kind of interactive pieces. It was generally a vague theme, but you really could choose kinda whatever you wanted to do. And I started to do stuff involving, involving lighting and involving video and very kind of multidisciplinary work. I was <span style="color:red" data-ts="1035.605" data-end_ts="1035.765" title="1035.605" id=c_"1035.605">__kept__</span>, kept up, carry on, you know, with, my interest in theater and working in theater doing, at that point I was doing kind of lighting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>I was doing sound, I was doing video then. And through Max I started to do a lot of kind of custom customizations and writing little applications and utilities for people. And I started to investigate some of the DMX stuff stuff for Max, started to build some of my own ex Max externals for, for <span style="color:red" data-ts="1060.325" data-end_ts="1060.525" title="1060.325" id=c_"1060.325">__do__</span>, for trying to achieve the things I was trying to achieve. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1062.245" data-end_ts="1062.485" title="1062.245" id=c_"1062.245">__Because__</span> at, at that point, there was a few objects for doing DMX. There was just, it was just limited to kind of the input output side. There was no, no really kind of things to actually deal with it once you've got into the application. Right. I also, around that time wrote my, DMA system, which is a, that was about the time Maxwell Ive come out. I thought, well, you know, this is like, this is a really great way for me to be able to do, to actually program lighting alongside Ableton sets. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>So I've just, you know, made some really simple devices to be able to, take prep Ableton parameters and put <span style="color:red" data-ts="1094.245" data-end_ts="1094.325" title="1094.245" id=c_"1094.245">__and__</span> map them to <span style="color:red" data-ts="1094.805" data-end_ts="1094.925" title="1094.805" id=c_"1094.805">__the__</span> max channels. And, did that used out a few shows. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="1098.245" data-end_ts="1098.405" title="1098.245" id=c_"1098.245">__then__</span> yeah, just kind of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1099.005" data-end_ts="1099.245" title="1099.005" id=c_"1099.005">__evolved__</span>, evolved from that point of like me, like trying to, to find ways to do things, to do things that I was presented with and working on my own kind of personal coursework, which in the end, kind of my last piece was very, very video focused. It was kind of like a, actually I've, you can watch the video on my website, but it was a, a dance piece we did using 3D visuals in the kind of, to do a kind of holographic effect. And that was like, as much as an exercise kind of show control as it was if a video or audio, because it was like the or about, had about three machines all linked together <span style="color:red" data-ts="1133.065" data-end_ts="1133.485" title="1133.065" id=c_"1133.065">__though__</span>, and all kind of with the, you know, the lighting, the, video components, the audio components, all kind of running, on connected systems. I put in the control <span style="color:red" data-ts="1143.005" data-end_ts="1143.165" title="1143.005" id=c_"1143.005">__light__</span> for everything kind of simultaneously, so I could kind of consider the effect of everything at once, which was an interesting way to work compared to kind of these sort of more focused disciplinary methods. You usually, isn't 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It? Right, right. Of all the things that you've worked on, what is the thing that that is most exciting to you? What, I mean, do you, it, it seems like you, you really, you were kind of drawn in by lighting and stuff like this, but you're getting a chance to work with video, but you also have this background in sound and even music. What's the thing that still gets, gets you revved up every time you get a chance to work on it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>So yeah. Anything with, interesting kind of control, problems often that comes from kind of interactive things where you're trying to, you're trying to do a show that takes, kind of more input than just this, you know, you press a button to advance to the next part of the show is <span style="color:red" data-ts="1193.405" data-end_ts="1193.485" title="1193.405" id=c_"1193.405">__a__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1193.485" data-end_ts="1193.605" title="1193.485" id=c_"1193.485">__fire__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1193.605" data-end_ts="1193.845" title="1193.605" id=c_"1193.605">__queue__</span> at this point where you're trying to make things more dynamic. One thing that I've developed, as, and there's another kind of Ableton module is a thing called MSC for live, which is a way to do Q <span style="color:red" data-ts="1207.805" data-end_ts="1208.045" title="1207.805" id=c_"1207.805">__based__</span> control of Ableton live sets. And this MSC is a protocol for like <span style="color:red" data-ts="1212.525" data-end_ts="1212.645" title="1212.525" id=c_"1212.525">__q__</span> commanding <span style="color:red" data-ts="1213.195" data-end_ts="1213.685" title="1213.195" id=c_"1213.195">__meeting__</span> show control. And so that way you can kind of link in to either to, to a lighting desk or to any other system that can communicate those QQ commands. Link that into, the wider show control system to command <span style="color:red" data-ts="1227.645" data-end_ts="1227.805" title="1227.645" id=c_"1227.645">__your__</span> Ableton set, which means that then you can start to kind of think of the Ableton session as like a server for providing sound and for keeping. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>And also then obviously the quantization comes into the point so you can say, I wanna command this, that we need to, it's like ramping this down now and it will happen when it's kind of musically appropriate. So that's kind of, that's sort of semi, it is kind of interactivity, maybe not in a way that a lot of people would define interactivity, but I think it's interactive because it's about responding to being, being able to take what, like something that's pre-programmed and respond to what's actually happening in a real environment. So those kind of things interest me a lot. Yeah. Anything that's slightly on our view out, out of ordinary in that sense. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You brought up interactivity and so right away I started thinking, I, I've worked with dancers a bunch in the past, and dancers are like fascinated with this idea of having like interactivity being like bend controllers on their elbows and stuff like that, which I always was able to, you know, I I think mostly by making really sad crying sounds <laugh>, I was able to get them to not consider it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Yeah, I, I know exactly what you mean. <laugh>. It's, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1299.645" data-end_ts="1299.765" title="1299.645" id=c_"1299.645">__I__</span>, I find with, so <span style="color:red" data-ts="1300.925" data-end_ts="1301.045" title="1300.925" id=c_"1300.925">__I__</span>, this happens a lot, with much less interesting projects, in my kind of professional life. When people, we have people come to us and say, right, we wanna do this, we wanna do a show, we wanna do this, this, and this, and we want it to be, and all they just say at the end, and we want it to be interactive. Right? And I say like, what, what do you mean by that? What, what do you want? <span style="color:red" data-ts="1319.225" data-end_ts="1319.445" title="1319.225" id=c_"1319.225">__And__</span> it's like, oh, I dunno. Just we want <laugh>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1321.945" data-end_ts="1322.165" title="1321.945" id=c_"1321.945">__it__</span> won't happen. And usually what they mean is they want like people to be able to kind of wave their hands and have stuff happen. Right. But I find that that often is, it, it's if, if you think about like what you're trying to set up when you, when you're, you're creating the control system for control data for a show, when you're kind of programming it, you're trying to do that with some kind of, kind of an, an artistic bent, like a vision of what should happen when you're trying to make something that's, that you know, is, is the best way it could be, present it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>And then to kind of throw in this idea of interactivity in for fixed shows into, into the mix, then I find often just ends up, you, you just, you, you know what you want and you know, and generally it's gonna be the same mo or nearly the same every single night, but you've then got this kind of uncertainty in it. I've seen things where so many cases where interactivity could be <span style="color:red" data-ts="1369.845" data-end_ts="1370.165" title="1369.845" id=c_"1369.845">__rehears__</span> could be replaced by just more rehearsal, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Where 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1373.565" data-end_ts="1373.725" title="1373.565" id=c_"1373.565">__People__</span>, where you've got a show where someone's standing in the same spot on stage every night, <laugh>, right? And, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1379.545" data-end_ts="1379.765" title="1379.545" id=c_"1379.545">__but__</span>, but at some point someone's decided, right, we want this to be interactive. So you've got all sorts of stuff with cameras and you're tracking this person, you're trying to make stuff follow 'em and happen. But ultimately it's the same show every night <span style="color:red" data-ts="1388.925" data-end_ts="1389.045" title="1388.925" id=c_"1388.925">__because__</span> it's a fixed show. Yeah. So it's like you could save a lot of bother if you just replaced that with, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>With, with rehearsing, with the video, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1396.325" data-end_ts="1396.525" title="1396.325" id=c_"1396.325">__few__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Rehearsal to make sure that he was absolutely standing in the same spot every night, <laugh>. And then you're absolutely gonna get what you've, what you've programmed as opposed to maybe what you've programmed as long as everything goes okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, the other one that I always get a kick out of is when people want like, interaction from the audience. And I'm just like, you know, the most popular emoticon now is that smiling turd <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>And so, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So unless something about your show really wants to embrace the equivalent of the smiling turd, I'm not actually sure that you want the voice of the people, you know, being highlighted in your show. But that seems to be a thing. And I think it's, I think it's sort of like shallow thinking, which is like, people are like, I want <span style="color:red" data-ts="1441.205" data-end_ts="1441.285" title="1441.205" id=c_"1441.205">__to__</span> involve the audience. Let's let them tweet in. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Yeah. It's, it's, yeah. It's like, I think it misunderstands kind of the point of you, you, you are presenting something and not to, you know, not <span style="color:red" data-ts="1452.245" data-end_ts="1452.365" title="1452.245" id=c_"1452.245">__to__</span>, that's kind of like dic dictator about it, but like the audience have come to watch the show that I'm presenting. Right. So the only, the only interactive thing which I've was really, really inspired by and actually <span style="color:red" data-ts="1463.325" data-end_ts="1463.525" title="1463.325" id=c_"1463.325">__did__</span> have done some kind of work using similar ideas was a theater piece, which was presented <span style="color:red" data-ts="1468.365" data-end_ts="1468.525" title="1468.365" id=c_"1468.365">__while__</span>, while I was in university. I, it was in, in the theater on campus by a group called Gob Squad, gob Squad's Kitchen, where they essentially, it was a very kind of improvised on their part a theater piece where Adver, there were four performers and at points throughout the show, they gradually replaced themselves with members of the audience, but they gave the members of the audience a headset, and then the performers sat in the audience and just told them what to say, <laugh> via a microphone. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>And I love that concept because it was, it was interactive. You were involved in the audience, however, you still maintained absolute control over what was actually happening. It was still the show you intended to present the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1506.525" data-end_ts="1506.645" title="1506.525" id=c_"1506.525">__attempt__</span>. That's great. I tried to do some, some, some works kind of exploring the idea. This is the, it is perhaps the only solely audio works that I've done, because I see it as an extension of a kind of the ideas of show control. Sure. So I've, I've done, pieces whereby, which I, I like to characterize as electronic music with no electronic output components. There's no actual speakers or, or, or electronic system amplification systems involved, but it's basically people all wearing headphones being, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1536.865" data-end_ts="1537.085" title="1536.865" id=c_"1536.865">__and__</span> we, I play tones in their ears and they have to reproduce the tone vocally. Oh, interesting. But the entire, the entire system is like a max, max based, system, which is giving them instructions from a set score. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's actually really fascinating. That's a cool idea. Because that's like using, I dunno, I'm always fascinated by things that, that use kind of peculiar conduits, especially if the conduit ends up being a person, a person having to interpret something, you know, whether it's an instruction on one of these creative cards or it, it's, you know, it's a graphic score or in this case, you know, you feeding stuff literally into <span style="color:red" data-ts="1579.965" data-end_ts="1580.205" title="1579.965" id=c_"1579.965">__some__</span>, into a headset or something. It seems like there's a lot of interesting stuff where a person ends up being the instrument that, that, produces, produces the sound and there's that interpretation that's required by that person. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Yeah. I liked, I, I liked also the idea that, you could have, if you were, were gonna present this in in a formal context, you, you could just have, you could just pick people out of the audience to do it. Right. And in a sense, you've got a person who is, while they are a performer, they're also a member of the audience. 'cause they're getting a different experience right there from the rest of the audience. But they are still, even though they're, they're performing it, they're still an audience member and they're still listen, they're still, hearing the work in <span style="color:red" data-ts="1624.805" data-end_ts="1624.885" title="1624.805" id=c_"1624.805">__a__</span>, just doing a different way. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Out, out of that is, I kind of struggle a lot with sometimes the barrier between like being, being an artist and being like a technologist <laugh>. Right. And I invariably, because of my professional work, I spend far much more time being a technologist and like kind of designing performance systems rather than actually designing, you know, artistic work. That piece is something which I feel, although I, I really, really love the idea behind it. I don't feel I've ever actually got it to work properly. And I think it's probably because I'm in love with the idea of it as a performance system as opposed to something that I can, I personally can actually use to create music. Right. So I'm interested <span style="color:red" data-ts="1664.355" data-end_ts="1664.645" title="1664.355" id=c_"1664.355">__that__</span> to to, to maybe potentially release that system and that patch just out further to, to see if like, if anyone other than me could make something that was more effective using it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it actually seems like one of those, you know, there's these little micro festivals or whatever where it's a festival that ha is built around a specific content or a context. Right. Like, you know, we're only gonna do pieces that are, you know, four, four hours longer, longer. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b><laugh>, that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1694.965" data-end_ts="1695.125" title="1694.965" id=c_"1694.965">__would__</span> be a, that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1695.605" data-end_ts="1695.645" title="1695.605" id=c_"1695.605">__would__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1695.645" data-end_ts="1695.725" title="1695.645" id=c_"1695.645">__be__</span> interesting festival 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Right. Or we're only gonna be, you know, all the performers have to be in their socks or something. Yeah, no. You know, but there are all these things that have like, these little tweaks in them and it seems like doing something where it's like, here's a tool and we're gonna try and, you know, get like four different composers and see what they are able to produce. It seems like that kind of thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. But I am always curious about people who, who work on systems like this. And again, I've worked with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1725.965" data-end_ts="1726.125" title="1725.965" id=c_"1725.965">__Dan__</span>, I've had some experience, but the, the primary, angle of your career and of your work is working on these shows and, but most of the people that listen to my podcasts are musicians and musicians have a luxury, the luxury of a musician is that you can sit in your mom's basement and hone your craft and get to be a better musician, better on your instrument or better <span style="color:red" data-ts="1755.075" data-end_ts="1755.365" title="1755.075" id=c_"1755.075">__site__</span> reader or whatever, so that when you get into a performance situation, you've got your chops together. Right. Yeah. How do you do that when what you're actually doing, the actual performance or the, the, even the practicing is with a whole theater crew tapping their toes, waiting for you to get your shit together. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b><laugh> it's, it, it's difficult. Yeah. It's, I mean, 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>I guess the, the, the, you know, you can start kind of start small and I can feel a lot of the things that I did in the early stages of my career before I was, before I had like access to, you know, before I was working <span style="color:red" data-ts="1800.005" data-end_ts="1800.165" title="1800.005" id=c_"1800.005">__at__</span> large shows and I've had access to actually kind of, you know, high level equipment was make stuff <span style="color:red" data-ts="1806.795" data-end_ts="1807.085" title="1806.795" id=c_"1806.795">__that__</span>, to get around limitations were imposed on me. But <span style="color:red" data-ts="1810.445" data-end_ts="1810.525" title="1810.445" id=c_"1810.445">__in__</span> fact, I didn't have that stuff Uhhuh. So like for example, the DMAC system, which I mentioned earlier for doing lighting in Ableton, I wrote that because I didn't, the only lighting desk we had in our theater was one that just did dimmers and wasn't very good at like doing moving light control or stuff for music. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So I, my my thought was, well I got a, you know, I've, I've been asked to do a, this huge, kind of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1832.885" data-end_ts="1833.165" title="1832.885" id=c_"1832.885">__dance__</span> university dance show that was like, you know, about 20 different acts. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>And I thought, well, like if I'd sit here and program this on, on this manual console, it's gonna take me months. I don't have that long. So therefore it was, I, I wrote that system to get around the fact that I couldn't do it on, you know, I didn't have the gear to do it, properly in a sense. So yeah, I, I guess there's kind of that and if you like, and that's, that's where like knowing stuff like Max and and various other software tools is a big help in that regard because you can kind of, you can fake your way around a lot of stuff. Well, I mean, let's say fake, it's still, it's still a valid <span style="color:red" data-ts="1869.685" data-end_ts="1869.885" title="1869.685" id=c_"1869.685">__way__</span> to do things, perhaps just not the way you would do if you had access to more money. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Right. Yeah. So what is, what is the equivalent then of practicing though, I mean, is is there such a thing, can you sort of like simulate stuff or if you're, if you're designing things, do you have ways of simulating what your design is gonna do so that you at least are fairly comfortable with it before you show up at the venue? 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Yeah. I mean, if you're doing straight video design, there's kind of ways of doing that. There's like, you know, kind of three specialist programs for doing, 3D simulation of like a stage set. And then you can look at video coming out of, a, a system on represented on the set. So if you're a video designer, there's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1912.685" data-end_ts="1912.765" title="1912.685" id=c_"1912.685">__with__</span> Yeah. There's tools available for that kind of thing. Now, if you're doing something kind of more specialist, which is usually what I'm doing, right, like for example, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1919.705" data-end_ts="1919.925" title="1919.705" id=c_"1919.705">__you__</span>, you're trying to interact with a particular piece of equipment that hasn't been built yet or something <laugh> or, or, or a system that doesn't yet exist. Right. Then the first thing I do when working on any of that project is to build a simulator, because without that you can't, you can't test <span style="color:red" data-ts="1936.565" data-end_ts="1936.685" title="1936.565" id=c_"1936.565">__anything__</span>. Right. And the answer more <span style="color:red" data-ts="1939.085" data-end_ts="1939.325" title="1939.085" id=c_"1939.085">__early__</span> to your question is that often there isn't a way. There <span style="color:red" data-ts="1941.745" data-end_ts="1941.965" title="1941.745" id=c_"1941.745">__is__</span>, and that's why unfortunately like the hours are so long tends to be when you actually get onto site in a project and you actually start working on something and you realize that everything you've tried before is, is not gonna work 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Yeah. So like one of my questions would want to be, what was the scenario where you like got to a show and you were just scared shitless? But I have a feeling that in a way the answer is, well, the last show that I did <laugh>, 'cause it kind of sounds like that's a big part of what you do, is you just sort of dump yourself into these unknown and maybe unknowable situations and are just like, well, I gotta figure it out now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Yeah. And, and it's, it's often that way. I, I've, it's, it's the ever the, the constant battle between the fact that when you're doing live work, it's, so much of it is based on a particular space and yet access to that space is the thing that is most limited because it's expensive and the, you know, you only, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1997.475" data-end_ts="1997.765" title="1997.475" id=c_"1997.475">__they__</span> only ever pay for the minimum amount of time it is to do something <laugh>. So yeah, it's often like you, you spend so much time on stuff when you get there and or, or you spend the time just sitting around doing nothing because everything, occasionally everything works, but it's, it's impossible to kind of know beforehand often. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That's, that's unreal. I, that's a bit of a highwire act and that's, that's gotta be, that's gotta be a little nerve wracking. So maybe it doesn't sound like something I would be super <laugh> comfortable with <laugh>, but, I suspect that there are other people that <span style="color:red" data-ts="2031.245" data-end_ts="2031.325" title="2031.245" id=c_"2031.245">__are__</span> be like, that sounds exciting. So if somebody wanted to get into this, what is, what is the path that they would take to get into this kind of work? 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Yeah, that's a difficult one for me because I came in at such a weird angle compared to most of my, my colleagues who work kind of more directly in show production. I kind of bridge this strange gap between quite, academic audio and, and multimedia audio visual work and ended <span style="color:red" data-ts="2059.065" data-end_ts="2059.285" title="2059.065" id=c_"2059.065">__and__</span> kind of because of the skills I acquired whilst I was studying that ended up doing, working in, in a show production environment. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, most of the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2067.045" data-end_ts="2067.165" title="2067.045" id=c_"2067.045">__other__</span>, my kind of colleagues in the show, show production world come from kind of like either from, you know, they've been doing it since they were 16 and they've just gradually worked their way up to, you know, larger shows. Right. Or they've gone to like a specialist college or, training to, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2082.365" data-end_ts="2082.685" title="2082.365" id=c_"2082.365">__studied__</span> that specific thing and now that's what they do. So yeah, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2085.765" data-end_ts="2085.885" title="2085.765" id=c_"2085.765">__mean__</span>, like unfortunately, I don't really know, I just kind of ended up doing this kind of thing because I was good at it and it was kind of a niche and like a world where I could come in with my kind of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2096.525" data-end_ts="2096.725" title="2096.525" id=c_"2096.525">__max__</span> skills and make stuff for people that like, they didn't, you know, that, that they couldn't see another way of doing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Or maybe unexpected. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>I would be struggle to explain how I ended up quite in my current position, but yeah, it's, it's kind of absolutely what I, what I want to be doing. <laugh>, just not quite sure how I got here 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Right. Well that's, that's pretty great. Yeah. This sort of like the funny path to current career seems to be in a way maybe a, a common thread for a lot of people because I think our whole, the whole media art and technology area is one of those things. It's literally that kind of career path that didn't exist 10 years ago and now there's like a level of excitement and a level of desire behind it that didn't exist. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Yeah. AB absolutely. Yeah. It's also a lot of it is, is knowing about it as well and knowing that these kind of things exist. Because I definitely didn't know when I was 16 that the job I'm doing now or what, what is sort of a job. It's kind of like a position of, the area of in which I work now really existed as a thing. Right? Like you could, there was something <span style="color:red" data-ts="2162.765" data-end_ts="2163.005" title="2162.765" id=c_"2162.765">__that__</span> you could do and survive <laugh> in <span style="color:red" data-ts="2165.405" data-end_ts="2165.525" title="2165.405" id=c_"2165.405">__a__</span> sense. I used to build crazy systems when, when I was younger for like school productions and stuff that is in a way weirdly similar to what I'm doing now, but I just didn't know that it was, I didn't know about the area. I didn't really know what I was doing. I kinda look back on it now and think, well that's, you know, I kind of threw it together with the, the knowledge and skills and kind of context that I had at the time, but now it's, you know, it would be, it would be really very, not just 'cause of the experience I have, but it's like, just by knowing that this was a thing 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Would find far easier now. So I, I think it's, it is partly that as well. It is, you know, as much as, as much as I think people desire to go down this route, the, especially the live elements of this and people who do content design for live productions as opposed to like, just for kind of TV and video, there are a few people who actually realize that this is an area, right. And that there's quite a lot of demand for it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So finally, not in terms of what you do for work, but in terms of what you do for your personal, your personal art, you mentioned the thing with the, the directed sound thing. What other kind of work do you have, personally that you think is kind of coming down the, coming down the path? What, what are you into in sort of like your personal work? 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>The <span style="color:red" data-ts="2243.245" data-end_ts="2243.405" title="2243.245" id=c_"2243.245">__at__</span>, at the moment I'm looking at the, for the, the directed performance thing I mentioned, I'm looking at trying to create that in the form of an app basically. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, the way I used to do it was essentially by getting large multi-channel audio interfaces and with some homemade adapters that letting plug headphones into the outputs. So like I could get enough in discrete outputs <span style="color:red" data-ts="2266.485" data-end_ts="2266.605" title="2266.485" id=c_"2266.485">__from__</span> my headphones since then. And now that basically everyone has a, like a smartphone <span style="color:red" data-ts="2271.475" data-end_ts="2271.765" title="2271.475" id=c_"2271.475">__like__</span> iOS or Android, what I'm trying to do is turn it into something that can be used as a proper distribute distributed performance system. So like within a local network. So I'm trying to make an app that you can kind of connect to like a server and then will actually distribute the commands and kind of take control of the performance with the hope that a, it can be, that system could be used with a, like a larger group of people, you know, and it presents some interesting kind of possibilities then for like, just, you know, a whole bunch of people showing up in a public place just all and plug their headphones into the system and produce some kind of, some kind of performance. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2305.055" data-end_ts="2305.405" title="2305.055" id=c_"2305.055">__Quite__</span> like the idea of it's, I mean <span style="color:red" data-ts="2306.915" data-end_ts="2307.205" title="2306.915" id=c_"2306.915">__it's__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2307.205" data-end_ts="2307.325" title="2307.205" id=c_"2307.205">__much__</span>, say <span style="color:red" data-ts="2307.525" data-end_ts="2307.685" title="2307.525" id=c_"2307.525">__it's__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2307.685" data-end_ts="2307.725" title="2307.685" id=c_"2307.685">__a__</span> kind of piece of artwork. Again, it's more about I'm designing a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2310.485" data-end_ts="2310.685" title="2310.485" id=c_"2310.485">__perform__</span>, I I'm seeing this in the moment as I'm designing a performance system. I dunno what I'm gonna do if I'm gonna, if I'm gonna make something with it after that or if I'm just <span style="color:red" data-ts="2317.525" data-end_ts="2317.725" title="2317.525" id=c_"2317.525">__gonna__</span> like talk to some other people and see are you interested in like, working with this? Right. In a way, maybe the second, second part of that I think would be more interesting to see what other people do with it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well it's always, it's always amazing because you put something like that together and you put it, you put it in the hands of somebody and you're like, well I wonder if they're gonna do this thing I imagined in an interesting way. And what instead they'll do is something you never imagined at all because they just, they didn't come into it with the perception of performing it your way. So they found their own and a lot of times real surprises can come out of that 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2350.735" data-end_ts="2351.085" title="2350.735" id=c_"2350.735">__Other__</span>. In terms of other things though, it's, the difficulty I have is for as much as I have access to a lot more kind of equipment and stuff than I used to, it's not in the sense of like, in the context of university, I could just like stroll into venues and say, I wanna book this, I wanna do this here. I don't really have that kind of capability. So it's difficult for the kind of work, the works that I was really interested in doing, which is generally stuff that is pretty large scale involving a lot of technology. It's actually a lot more difficult to kind of put that stuff on and put it together anymore, especially when working as an individual. So I'm still kind <span style="color:red" data-ts="2380.925" data-end_ts="2380.965" title="2380.925" id=c_"2380.925">__of__</span> looking for ways to, on how like in the future, how I can actually do that kind of thing. Right. Which it's difficult. So, but in the meantime I'm kind of looking at these more kind of, there still may be as technologically complex, but not so many specific demands on pe on other people's time or equipment 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Or place. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Or place. Yes as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. Well, David, I want to thank you so much for your time. This is really interesting and really, really eye-opening in terms of, not only what you do and and how you got there, but also what that whole terrain looks like and the, and the real changes that that show control's going through. So thanks for your time and for opening those doors for us. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Thanks Owen. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright. And with that, I'll, I'll let you have your day. Thanks. Thank you so much. I'll talk to you soon. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Thanks <span style="color:red" data-ts="2427.955" data-end_ts="2428.245" title="2427.955" id=c_"2427.955">__Paul__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Many thanks to David for talking with us today. It was really interesting to hear more about the world of show control and lighting and all the good stuff in between there. Sounds like a real fascinating line of work. Also sounds completely unnerving. So, it's really interesting to get a view on that from David. Thank you so much for you as the listeners for tuning in and for sharing this and for keeping, keeping on, keeping on. I really appreciate it and I'll be talking to you next week. Bye.
