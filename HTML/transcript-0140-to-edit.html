<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today I have a great opportunity to talk to somebody that, I was introduced to by, Julian Bale, who has been interviewed, before for the podcast. He mentioned this woman, <span style="color:red" data-ts="30.985" data-end_ts="31.405" title="30.985" id=c_"30.985">__Corley__</span> Kin, and said that she was pretty interesting in the work she did. So he gave me, her contact information and her website, and I went to the website and I just had a lot of fun. I always know that something's gonna work when I go to somebody's website, and it just comes up several times through the course of a couple of days. There was a lot of interesting stuff. There's a story apparently that needs to be told, I think. And so we're gonna dive into that a little bit. But with that, we're going to say hi to Corley. Hi, how are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Coralie Diatkine: </b>Hi. Hi, Darwin I'm fine, thank you. And you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm great. Thank you so much for doing this. It's, it's fantastic to have you on the, on the podcast and have you be a part of this discussion. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Coralie: </b>Yeah. Well, thanks for giving me the opportunity to talk about my work. I really appreciate that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure, sure. So let's start off by having you, talk a little bit about, about your work. Why don't you describe your, your work to people first. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Coralie: </b>Okay. So I should probably start by just, describing myself a little bit. I think everybody has their own prospect and their own history, but, so I'm from a, a very academic and classical musical background initially, and I think that probably has a huge influence over, my, my goals, and my, my prospects, the way I approach the work in a positive and maybe, sometimes a little, maybe negative way in the sense that it, it, it can be, very structuring, but maybe sometimes too much. So I try, I try to forget about it a little. So I was, I was trained in a conservatory. I studied violin and piano from the age of five, music theory in France, in a very French way, <laugh> at some point. I, I, when I grew up, I, I had this kind of rejection of this background, which was not very, you know, in, in, in phase with, with my own background. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Coralie: </b>So I started, you know, playing rock and, and noisy things, noisy pop and, and things in my, in my garage with my friends. I played guitar and drums, and then I got to, to touch to, analog <span style="color:red" data-ts="164.645" data-end_ts="164.885" title="164.645" id=c_"164.645">__since__</span> like, Moogs and that kind of, that kind of tool. And I think that's the first step, that, that led me to be interested in sound textures and approaching synthesis in a, in a very naive way. Because at the time, I was like 14 or something. Right. So I, I, I try to understand, and I think I was a little frustrated because most of our, my friends <span style="color:red" data-ts="189.545" data-end_ts="189.765" title="189.545" id=c_"189.545">__and__</span>, and, and also myself, were a little, we were not trying to be systematic, and we were not scientific you our approach of things. It was just fun, you know? Right, right. But I, I really enjoyed so much analog sound. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Coralie: </b>I really loved it because we would plug the scenes on, you know, tube amps and, and we would also play on like, you know, instruments and guitar. So it would have this, this very warm sound, very organic. And, and I think that's something that made me enjoy electronic music, probably. So to get back to, to the path I followed then, I was not really encouraged into music. So at some point, I, you know, I, I kept on, doing, studies in humanity, humanity field, but I was not very happy with that. So I went back to the conservatory after I got my A level, and then I kept on, you know, following that academic path in the sense that I, I loved singing. I really loved that. So I studied lyrics, singing, and, but I, on the other hand, it was not enough for me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Coralie: </b>So I did electroacoustic, and, and a bit of, of, computer assisted music too, in the conservatory. So I, in France, you know, France is a country where in most places, access is not really given to programming, be it through code or through graphic interfaces. I had the, the, the, I was lucky enough to be in Paris at the time. And, one of my teachers was, was a member of <span style="color:red" data-ts="284.125" data-end_ts="284.405" title="284.125" id=c_"284.125">__<inaudible>__</span>. And he, he was a composer, and he was a lot into, music speculation, but applied to code. So he would, he would <span style="color:red" data-ts="294.325" data-end_ts="294.765" title="294.325" id=c_"294.325">__introduce__</span>, introduce us to C Sound, that kind of stuff, which was very seldom at the time. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So I don't think I was ready to understand that I was, I was still very young. <span style="color:red" data-ts="305.165" data-end_ts="305.365" title="305.165" id=c_"305.165">__And__</span>, but it was still connected to the traditional approach of composition, really. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Coralie: </b>And then I got into lyric singing. I, I, I started following that, that path. I did musicology studies and all, and at some point when I was, still a singer, I had to stop singing for reasons that are not very interesting. But, and I had to think of, okay, what do I wanna do? And I thought with that, the background I had, that was that implied, you know, musicology, composition, orchestration, psychoacoustics, I thought, okay, I, why wouldn't I try to be a sound designer? And at the time, I didn't see me as an, as an artist, as, as strange as it might be. I, I, so I thought, okay, I have to do something that is, that involves my knowledge of sound, right? That, that allows me to be creative, that allows me to think about what I'm doing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Coralie: </b>But on the other hand, to be very, like an architect, you know, like, structured. Yeah, yeah. Like an engineer structured, because I was kind of scared of the craziness that <span style="color:red" data-ts="372.675" data-end_ts="372.965" title="372.675" id=c_"372.675">__lies__</span> behind the artistic work, <laugh>, which I had the, the opportunity to experiment myself, you know, when I wrote music, I could become very, very disorganized and messy and, and have these ideas that would invade my, my mind, and I would have issues to catalyze that stuff. And, and also, once I would've written a piece, would it be electroacoustic or in instrumental, I would feel really, surprised and, and a bit confused about the fact that, you know, the, the, the object you produce doesn't really belong to you anymore. Right? Right. You don't expect, you know, you, you hear what you've been doing, and you think, okay, should I be happy or not? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Coralie: </b>And it's not a <span style="color:red" data-ts="414.365" data-end_ts="414.525" title="414.365" id=c_"414.365">__bit__</span> a matter of having an audience that is, you know, satisfied or, or thrilled or whatever. It's really something personal. Sure. I went to, I went back to studies like only five years ago. What I'm telling you about happened, a few years ago, only, I had no idea about MaxMSP. I only knew that, some people that in my, in my conservatory when I did electro studies, would use that stuff. But then it was like, probably <span style="color:red" data-ts="446.905" data-end_ts="447.125" title="446.905" id=c_"446.905">__in__</span> 2000 and 2000, 2005. Okay. Alright. So I, I did one year of, sound design studies in Paris, well, near Paris. And I started, using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data">PD</a> a little bit, but it was not very structured. And it was, yeah. The teaching was not very systematic. So it was interesting, interesting. But I felt I wouldn't have a clear understanding of the, the subject. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Coralie: </b>So I, I, that was my first step. And then, I finished my ma in, in Belfast at <span style="color:red" data-ts="482.235" data-end_ts="482.525" title="482.235" id=c_"482.235">__sarc__</span>, Sonic Art Research Center, which is part of Queens University, Belfast. And then I had this very intense teaching about MaxMSP, and that's how I got to use MaxMSP. That's how I got actually to go back to Sonic Arts. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and, and to produce works that were not, some design, works. They were real, even though they were, you know, academic things that were short, et cetera. They were strictly, yeah. Musical pieces, I would say right in, in between. I did, I did work as a sound designer in the industry, in France before I, I went to Belfast. And, and I would also, I have, to use max MSP for my sound design at a very basic level, I would say. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Coralie: </b>And it was fun, but I would still, yeah, I, I, I was very methodic, very organized, very structured. But I had this, very personal approach of, of sound. I, I think not having, having an academic background, I've been a lyric singer. You know, I, I sang early music. I, I to, I listen to pieces that could be, you know, middle ages from middle ages to, to, I don't know, Radiohead, <laugh>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="562.935" data-end_ts="563.605" title="562.935" id=c_"562.935">__electronic__</span> music like, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="565.495" data-end_ts="565.845" title="565.495" id=c_"565.495">__craft__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="565.875" data-end_ts="566.165" title="565.875" id=c_"565.875">__work__</span> or Japanese noise, and, and Right. Japanese, Japanese traditional music, you know. So my background is a bit weird, so I don't come from the mainstream. And I think it, it, you can hear it in, in the things I do. I, I try to experiment. I, I'm interested in micro intervals, psychoacoustics. So I try things that might not sound really appealing at first. And then I try to use my, my own taste, taste to, to go to something that is, to reach something that is more musical. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That makes, first of all, that really rings true when you listen to your work. I mean, your work is, has got, a, a very interesting sound to it. And also, one of the things that I liked from looking at your website is that you sorta are not scared to show your experiments, right? Yeah. You're, you're willing to say, here's something I'm trying out. Have a listen. You know, I think that that's actually really important. And it's a thing, artists oftentimes want to hide things until, their ideas maybe, you know, they think they've completely finished or they've completely blossomed. And I think it's really cool that you've kind of offered us a glimpse into some of the things that you're trying out. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Coralie: </b>Yeah. Maybe it's because I, I don't see myself as a completely, as an artist, but also as a, as a designer, I wouldn't even say, you know, sound designer, I would say as a designer. Right. I, I'm, I'm someone who, who has questions. You probably think of the, the stuff I, I posted about 3D audio and Yes. Yeah, it was part of my, my ma project. So <span style="color:red" data-ts="667.245" data-end_ts="667.365" title="667.245" id=c_"667.245">__I__</span>, there was a lot of thinking, a lot of research involved behind. And so maybe it's also because I was asked Yeah. To clarify things, to explain my approach, and to show that I had, that I have this regard, this, you know, this seriousness about what I do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Coralie: </b>So, yeah, I'm more on that side of things. I would say, like, maybe I always feel I have something to prove <laugh>, in terms of, professionalism, I would say. Right. And I think it's, it's just me. Maybe if I, you know, if I keep on, keep on evolving, maybe in five years I would be, you know, hiding things too. Maybe I, I won't, I won't talk about my work anymore, <laugh>. But yeah, that's, something I like doing because I think it's interesting and well, you know, there is this saying it's very, very <span style="color:red" data-ts="713.685" data-end_ts="714.005" title="713.685" id=c_"713.685">__banner__</span>, but, it's not the result that matters. It's the path <laugh>. Right. I think it's, yeah. I mean, I think it's true. And there is a painter maybe that you might know who's called Richter. He's very, I mean, the, the, the things he does are close to photography. It's kind of realistic, but it's very beautiful. And he talks a lot about the, the way he works and his failures, and also, I think, yeah. And I think that's interesting too. I mean, it depends on the people. I don't 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Know. Yeah. I, well, I think for, for people outside of the practice, what it does is it kind of humanizes that connection. It makes you feel like, you almost have a personal investment in seeing them succeed, which is maybe why I found, your descriptions of what you do so compelling. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Coralie: </b>Mm-Hmm. <span style="color:red" data-ts="764.185" data-end_ts="764.605" title="764.185" id=c_"764.185">__Thanks__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Now I have some questions though, based on what you mainly, and what, what you kind of just, just told me about, because some of the things that you talk about, actually, first of all, they ring really, really true to me and really close to the way I feel. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And one of one of those things is you, when you had, when you talked about stuff, you talked about, first of all, art seeming to be a messy thing, but that you have a desire to be a, a more structured person or a person who takes on things more systematically. Do you think that, that there's any kind of conflict between trying to be systematic when you're also trying to work in an experimental field? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Coralie: </b>No, I don't. I think it's, there is some kind of dialectic, it could be a conflict if you approach it in a way that is not, I think it takes time in life to, to reach the stage where it's not con, it doesn't create anymore any conflict anymore. I think <span style="color:red" data-ts="832.565" data-end_ts="832.685" title="832.565" id=c_"832.565">__a__</span> structure is something that, that we all need at some, at various levels, right? When it takes too much space, it's a problem. But I think that, that when structure is, it's like the roots, you know, there is, it's strong. It's there. And some people have been lucky enough, you know, to get these structures when they were kids, you know, it's like kids who study code, you know? And now they, they, they do it very young, which, which was not my case. And I'm not from a scientific background. I mean, I'm, I'm a pure, you know, I'm a poor product of, of humanities. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Coralie: </b>So <laugh>, I studied acoustics and stuff, but much later, I mean, I, I did a lot of maths, but only a few years ago. So, and composition, for instance, I mean, I got very strong structures because I went to conservatory as a kid, right? So music, I mean, the, the, the tradition of, of Occidental music is there. And it also gives me tools to understand music that are, that are not accidental, but that, that have <span style="color:red" data-ts="891.495" data-end_ts="891.845" title="891.495" id=c_"891.495">__these__</span>, these structures such as Japanese music or Lan music or these things. I, I completely agree that there are different approaches. I mean, if you think of Cage, if you think of, of these people, but still, I mean, if even though these people have invented their own language, you know, I, I mostly refer to people that are dead now because, you know, they have this, they have built this, this huge work. So it's easier to, to think about it. But, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, the, these people set the framework that we're able to use, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Coralie: </b>Yeah. So, so <span style="color:red" data-ts="928.725" data-end_ts="928.925" title="928.725" id=c_"928.725">__they__</span>, they are very free, like, you know. Yes. He, he was, he went to study with Mession, and Messian told him, I can't teach you anything like, you, you don't need me. You know? And, and like, he worked on, on Serialism in a very, very systematic way. And on the other hand, like, he had these ideas that were <span style="color:red" data-ts="947.185" data-end_ts="947.405" title="947.185" id=c_"947.185">__com__</span> that were so beautiful and original and mystic. So I think if you are, it's, it's a bit like, I think it's a bit like, like zen art. It's, it's about doing a lot of work, preparatory work, and repeating things a lot of times, you know? And once it's there, it's in you, you produce the work and you stop thinking. And that's, I think that's when, when imagination, you know, takes power and, it doesn't have to be something chronological, you know, it can be two processes that are, that can be either like, one follows the other, or they, they can be parallel, you know? But I think the brain needs these two things. Like, you build something that is very structured that, and it can be almost like unconscious, you know? And then you produce your work, and when you produce, you, you stop thinking about these things. So everybody has a way to, to get this structure can be, you know, when you're young, or it can be all your life, I don't know. But it, it shouldn't be a conflict, I think. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's interesting you say it that way, because one of the things that I've noticed is that, is that people who've grown up and studied in France, when, when they talk about their background, it's, it's a very, and especially in your case, you went down this very academic and very conservatory based, system. And, and France is pretty well known for having a pretty serious and very formal bureaucracy behind going through those kind of studies, right? Yes, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Coralie: </b>Yes. Very, very. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But I also find that some of the people who are willing to take interesting and thoughtful approaches to how they, how they approach art and specifically music, it seems to really be focused on music and sound. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1056.745" data-end_ts="1056.965" title="1056.745" id=c_"1056.745">__Mm__</span>. That there are some of the most adventurous people I know are the product of that very formal system, even though at some point you have to sort of like escape the formalism to, create the completely new work. And, and I think what you just told me kind of helps explain that a little bit. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Coralie: </b>Yeah. Well, you know, in France, the thing is that we attract a lot of foreigners. I I know many people who went to the conservatory, you know, and who did, composition studies and who are now famous composers, you know? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, most of them are Italians. Some of them that I know are Chinese, Japanese, I don't know any German, because I think the German are very, very good at, you know, teaching music. Same for the English, but what I mean is that, France is good at <span style="color:red" data-ts="1108.755" data-end_ts="1109.045" title="1108.755" id=c_"1108.755">__that__</span>. It has still very strong institutions that have a very, very strong reputation. So we draw a lot of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1115.245" data-end_ts="1115.405" title="1115.245" id=c_"1115.245">__France__</span>. But so what I know from Italian composers, for instance, is <span style="color:red" data-ts="1119.125" data-end_ts="1119.245" title="1119.125" id=c_"1119.125">__a__</span> decade, a very, very strong academic training in, in counterpoint harmony. And, and it gives them that, that kind of stability, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Coralie: </b>And then these guys are, they have a, and, and it's not just men, it's also women. They have <span style="color:red" data-ts="1136.045" data-end_ts="1136.325" title="1136.045" id=c_"1136.045">__these__</span>, these very, very strong culture, traditional culture. They know a lot about fine arts. They know a lot about myths. They have this very strong relating culture for most of them, but it doesn't prevent them then from Yeah. From imagining things and, and, and extrapolating things out of a very, yeah. Organized languages, right? It's, it's the same about code. You know, it's the same about, be it code being, be it written or not. It has a very strong logic. It's a language, you know? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But it, it is, it is well <span style="color:red" data-ts="1173.525" data-end_ts="1173.805" title="1173.525" id=c_"1173.525">__built__</span>. And the, the fact that it is a language that is very well <span style="color:red" data-ts="1176.525" data-end_ts="1176.805" title="1176.525" id=c_"1176.525">__built__</span> and that is versatile and metaphorical, that the metaphor, the idea of the metaphor is very strong. It, it allows you to build things out of just, data, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Coralie: </b>If your, if your mind is structured enough to use that, the, the power of language at any level, and the fact that data is just data, then if you have enough imagination, it allows you to really, develop things that are, that no one would've thought of before. I think it makes it really, really, that's what makes it so thrilling and so, so enthusiastic <span style="color:red" data-ts="1213.045" data-end_ts="1213.245" title="1213.045" id=c_"1213.045">__and__</span> so, so, yeah. So, so stimulating. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's interesting that you use, that, you talk about the metaphor, because that was, that was the next place I was gonna go, but the concept of the metaphor actually really explains it. My question was going to be, you know, you describe sort of the French formalism as being tied to a language, it's like the language of counterpoint or the language of harmony. Yes. Or whatever. And so often when we, whenever we learn any language, we tend to think within the framework of that language. Right. And that language kind of describes how we're going to think. Hmm. But what you just stated, which is this concept of the metaphor Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> is actually one of the ways that we're able to break free of the limits of a language, right? Hmm. And so where I was going to ask, you know, how do you get away from the, the language that that formalism provides? You actually gave me the answer already, which is this concept that the metaphor allows you to sort of like, shoot beyond what the basic language might tell you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Coralie: </b>Yes. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1282.485" data-end_ts="1282.685" title="1282.485" id=c_"1282.485">__And__</span> I think it's, well, I, I think it's the fact that when you think of what data is, is that data is just numbers, it's just figures. And it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1291.885" data-end_ts="1292.005" title="1291.885" id=c_"1291.885">__a__</span>, a relationship between the figures and the numbers, and so that you can interpret it the way you want. You know, then it, it comes to, to choices that you make and things you want to talk about, you know? And that is not related with language. It's, it's related with one's life. You know, what do I want to talk about? So of course, there are, there are recurrences and there are light motives in, in, you know, in, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1319.985" data-end_ts="1320.205" title="1319.985" id=c_"1319.985">__in__</span>, I I'm thinking mostly of art science projects, you know, it's about earthquakes and stars and, and biological phenomenas and stuff. And yeah, it's, it's very exciting. And I think it might be a trend, but I think if one takes a bit of time to, to really go and be introspective about what, what makes one vibrate, you can find other things to talk about. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Coralie: </b>But still, that's, that's apparent. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1347.885" data-end_ts="1348.125" title="1347.885" id=c_"1347.885">__This__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1348.125" data-end_ts="1348.285" title="1348.125" id=c_"1348.125">__is__</span>, the thing is, when you code, when you use an interface, whatever, you, you have this language, okay, you have to use a language, but the fact that it's processes and data and that you can apply these things to, any media such as sound or image, and that you can create relationship between the media, that you can create interactions, et cetera, it gives you so much, so much flexibility, that there is no excuse for being, for having no ideas, I would say, or, or being or sounding like, like anyone, you know, because you have so many options. You have to choose an option, but you have so many ones, so many options that, yeah, it's, it's a way to be free, but still, you have the language, you have the constraints, you have, you can give yourself constraints, you know, and that's what is nice about it, you know? Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>One of the things that when, when people are confronted with the opportunity to have so many options, sometimes people get frightened, sometimes they get worried that they've chosen the wrong option, or that they've, they're, they're running down the wrong path. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Coralie: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>How do you, how do you get beyond that? How do you, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Coralie: </b>I, I only started getting beyond it a few days ago, actually. <laugh>, and all the, I'm not even sure I have, but, it's a question that you might, you know, think about any event in, in life. Right. You know, and actually life is the answer. I mean, I tried, you know, to make the right choice all the time. And what I realized is that I just have to meet someone randomly have a discussion that was completely unexpected, and then it's gonna make me make a decision. Right. And, and that's, and there is nothing I can do about it. So that, that's me. But still, I mean, joke being a part, that, that joke apart, I think there is time for trying to assess and evaluate and, and make the choices, but at some point, you make the decision. And, and that is something that is related to things that are very hard to explain, and you have to accept it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Coralie: </b>There is no, it's easy to say, but there is no right choice. Well, I think that's true. There are necessities and there are things that are, that are there to guide you and that you can't really understand. But you can also try and take the time to really think, okay, what, what are the things I want to experiment about that I don't know. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, what are the things that I, i, I am comfortable with and that I really, want to develop because I know I'm good at those. And, and then it probably can help you make the choices we are talking about. For instance, the project I'm working on at the moment is a project that I have in mind. Like, it's built upon many, many different aspects of my life of, encounters I made of interests I have in music and science. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Coralie: </b>I managed somehow to give it some sort of coherence, but it's just because I'm good at, you know, trying to assemble these things together. Right. It could be completely a tar <span style="color:red" data-ts="1548.575" data-end_ts="1548.925" title="1548.575" id=c_"1548.575">__light__</span> and, and, and weird, but actually it's not. And that's because I've decided I, i, I wanted to give it that coherence. Right? So, yeah, your question was how do I get beyond, you know, not making the right choice? I, it's, it's just because my life has put me in, in a, into a position where I had to make choices in, in, in situations of emergency. Like, you know, when I lost my voice Yeah. What do I do? Okay. And I, I made <span style="color:red" data-ts="1577.405" data-end_ts="1577.605" title="1577.405" id=c_"1577.405">__the__</span> decision, like 10 minutes when I was in, in the uk, everybody was playing music, but me, I've been a musician since I was five. I was a singer. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Coralie: </b>I couldn't sing, and I would see people playing and playing, and I was miserable. And I remember I was, I was laying in bed waiting to fall asleep, and the sentence come into my mind, you take a saxophone, you know? And in the morning after I was taking a saxophone, and I was taking my next lesson the day after, and I haven't stopped playing since then, and I played two hours a day. And, and it's, I've never felt so happy about that. And I can't explain why the saxophone, yeah. It's something vocal, whatever. But like, it's an instrument I had never played. I love the sound. I know sax players, et cetera. I could have, you know, decided to keep on singing at some point, or, you know, start again, whatever. I said, no, I want to play the saxophone now. I'm improvising with a saxophone. I'm gonna, I'm working on a patch to like work on electronic and saxophone. Right. And, and I'm, yeah, I'm getting to play with people and I can't explain that. And, and that's perfectly okay, you know? Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Do you mind telling us why you stopped, I mean, after the way you talk about having, studied and performed with voice? <span style="color:red" data-ts="1650.945" data-end_ts="1651.165" title="1650.945" id=c_"1650.945">__Mm__</span>. It's clear that, that, that at one point that really represented your path to the future, and then you stopped. Mm. Do you mind telling us why you stopped? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Coralie: </b>I, well, it's, it's very, I don't mind talking about it. It's just that I don't, I don't know if people would be interested in knowing about, about that, but, I don't know if you've tried to sing, I mean, not like songs that you sing with your friends, but, like using a technique that is kind of lyric or whatever, but, Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, it involves a lot of physical strength. It implies being very, yeah, physically in shape and, confident and not, not overthinking things, not wondering too much about what you're doing. And, and when you are on a stage, no matter how, how much you've worked, when you get on the stage, you see those people looking at you and they look at you in a way that is not the same way as they would look at a player. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Coralie: </b>An instrumentalist. There is something about voice that gives you power. It's scary. It really is, especially when you're a solo singer. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1722.965" data-end_ts="1723.085" title="1722.965" id=c_"1722.965">__I__</span>, I, I've had the opportunity to do a few premieres and to sing as a solo singer. And even though I felt I was not ready for that, people would come talk to me after that and they would, you know, tell me things that I was completely unaware of. And they would pay attention to things that are related with what you are and not with what you do. And, and that's really weird. So, you know, you feel you have the power of other people, and that's something I really didn't like. Also, singers have an ego. They have to have an ego. They have to love themselves. And I think at the time, I was not <span style="color:red" data-ts="1755.725" data-end_ts="1756.005" title="1755.725" id=c_"1755.725">__reading__</span> to that. I was very self-critical. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Coralie: </b>I have a very good ear, you know, I have, I'm very focused on technique. So that was my concern, you know, like singing well and, and not be into acting or be into just displaying my skills and feeling so proud about what I was doing. It happened. I stopped singing when I had the perfect opportunity. I was about to go to Stuttgart Conservatory to finish my, my, my course of studies. I, I was about to meet excellent teachers, like people that were so good and so positive and so encouraging. And I just felt probably just too in confident, too critical. And, and there's something about this background of singing, like, especially in France, which is very conservative, full of people that are very full of themselves, <laugh>, which is probably not the case in Germany. Like, for instance, in Stuttgart, they, they, they told me, you like electronic music, but you know, we offer a class for singers who want to learn about that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Coralie: </b>And I was like, wow, okay. That's impossible in France, <laugh>, right? When you singer in France, like, you wear a silk dress <span style="color:red" data-ts="1829.545" data-end_ts="1829.965" title="1829.545" id=c_"1829.545">__hiding__</span> your shoes, and you have to look, completely, you know? Yeah. Things haven't changed since, since the end of the 19th century for singers. I mean, in a very stereotypical way. There are singers in France that are brilliant, who love contemporary music and stuff, but there are exceptions, right? So I had a inner conflict about the way I perceived the background of singing. I didn't feel I had a place there, and I, I was not expecting that people would give me the chance to, to do that, to do my, my own thing as a singer in Stut Garden. And, I felt I didn't deserve that, probably. And I just got scared. And then I, I didn't even, you know, lose my voice or whatever. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Coralie: </b>I just kept on getting sore throats couldn't stop, and I couldn't do the, the, the entrance competition. I was also a bit un uncertain about my chances to get there and to make it. But, the, the fact that I kept on being sick was, was the main problem. And I did, actually my best concert after being sick like that, I was, I was in pain. I did the best concert I ever did, and I never recovered <laugh> Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> like for three months I was not able to say a word. I went to see doctors. They would tell me, your voice is perfect. There is nothing wrong. And I think my body would just say, stop. My body didn't want it anymore. I was just miserable. And then it took me a while, I, I started taking lessons again. The pain would still be there, but people would tell me, yeah, your voice is so beautiful, you have to do it, et cetera. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Coralie: </b>And I was basically like, yeah, whatever, you know, <laugh>, it's useless and et cetera. And at some point I thought, okay, I'm not recovering, so I have to do something else. And then what's funny is that I noticed, I, you know, I was in my, in my shower the other day and I started singing because I felt happy, and I noticed my voice is, is is still there. It's even better than before because I play the saxophone, and I could, you know, think, yeah, I should take lessons again. But no, I mean, it's, it's, it's passed and, I know I can do it. I know it's, it's, it's there, but, it's not me anymore. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, it's, it's actually interesting because I went through a similar path with the guitar as my mean instrument, right? When I was, I studied guitar very seriously at, in, at a university. Again, what started happening, very similar to you, it's like my body tried to defeat my mind, right? It's like, because guitar is a very physical instrument, and it has some of the same issues that you talk about with, singing. I think any instrument <span style="color:red" data-ts="2002.505" data-end_ts="2002.725" title="2002.505" id=c_"2002.505">__ca__</span> has the potential for having people that are full of themselves, but guitar, especially with sort of like, you know, the standing on stage and grimacing and acting like the center of, of attention is sort of like the antithesis of what I'm comfortable with anyway. And, I ran into situations where my body seemed to want to defeat my ability to succeed on the instrument. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And at the time, I was really, I was almost unwilling to listen to what my body was saying, right? I was like, no, I have to get over this. I have to power through this. But, you know, subsequently, what, it's what led me to focus on, more electronic music, because since there wasn't this physical nature to it, it allowed me to be more intellectual and less physical about the work. And I think I appreciate that. Now, recently I've started working with the guitar again. But this is after many, many years, and I'm glad I'm able to do it again. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2067.145" data-end_ts="2067.365" title="2067.145" id=c_"2067.145">__it__</span> similarly, it's interesting that you have, you have approached the saxophone, which is a very vocal and kind of lyrical instrument. Mm-Hmm. So it seems like you'd be able to bring some of your, some of the sensibilities of being a vocalist into being a saxophonist. Does that feel like it's the case? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Coralie: </b>Prob probably the thing is, I think the fact I, I learned saxophone abroad. My first teacher, and I, I want to say his name because I think, you might know him. And, and he's not just a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2103.925" data-end_ts="2104.085" title="2103.925" id=c_"2103.925">__sex__</span> player. He's called Nan Markets. Oh, he's, from me, Mexico. But he, when he speaks, he's got this, accent from, you know, the, the states, because he, he spent a lot of his time in the States. He's an improviser, and he does a lot of electronic music too. And he gave me like two, three lessons. And the thing is, he's the kind of person, you know, who is not, who has the good approach that that is, that was nothing. But okay, I'm gonna show you how to do. There is no, it's hard, it's easy, whatever, you know, it's just facts. Here is how you do it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Coralie: </b>He was not overdoing it. He was not like congratulating me every five minutes. He was not trying to be a bit sadistic, you know, like some teachers can be, right? And, and I think if I had had teachers like this, since I learned music as a child, I, I would have a, had accomplished different prospect on music. So the thing about being lyrical, I think is something I, I can do. I, I think I would do it in a way that doesn't involve, involve my ego. I think I, I can do it in a way that I'm just a medium, right? Right. I'm expressing personal things, but there is no pride about it. I'm just standing there. And I guess now, if I had to sing, I would, I would do the same thing. But at the time when I was a singer, I wouldn't have done it that way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Coralie: </b>I would've been, you know, judging myself and wondering, oh, I'm <span style="color:red" data-ts="2200.805" data-end_ts="2201.085" title="2200.805" id=c_"2200.805">__seeing__</span>, you know, I am singing a love, a love song. And so it's about love and what is love? No, I think now I, I would do it completely differently. Like, for instance, there is one of the first piece I I learned as a s sex <span style="color:red" data-ts="2213.845" data-end_ts="2214.085" title="2213.845" id=c_"2213.845">__player__</span> is, and I chose it myself. My one and Only Love. It's a song that Coltrane did with a, with a singer. And I don't really like vocal jazz, actually. Yeah. But this song is, is <span style="color:red" data-ts="2226.565" data-end_ts="2226.885" title="2226.565" id=c_"2226.565">__obvious__</span>. It's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2227.125" data-end_ts="2227.205" title="2227.125" id=c_"2227.125">__a__</span> ballad, and it's very beautiful. I remember I was so surprised because, you know, I'm, I'm a young player, I'm not able to play anything, but I was able to play it with all my hearts, but without shame and with, great simplicity, you know? And, and that's, that's what I learned with saxophone and, and with, with the guys I had the opportunity to meet. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Coralie: </b>And probably it's because also they are just players, you know? It's a different approach to music when you're a just player, because you learn music in a very, you know, it's very structured. But you, you learn how to improvise. You learn the language, you learn how to be responsible for what you do. It's not like in the conservatory when you, you, when you learn an instrument. And, and I, I also teach music. So, you know, I, I see kids who have lessons in the conservatory, and I, and I know how music is taught in conservatories. It's, it's not the right approach at all. So they don't learn how to be responsible for what they do. They don't learn how to be sincere and true. And yet, having the comments in the end, you know, they, they are just people who try to apply a technique and perform a piece the best way they can, but they don't understand what they do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Coralie: </b>They don't understand the structure of the piece. They don't understand the intentions, they don't understand the aesthetics, whatever. And when you learn jazz, when you learn how to play jazz, that's the opposite, right? Like, you have to understand the aesthetics. You, you, most, most of the time, like, you know, who was called <span style="color:red" data-ts="2314.805" data-end_ts="2315.045" title="2314.805" id=c_"2314.805">__trained__</span>, you know, who was <span style="color:red" data-ts="2316.135" data-end_ts="2316.485" title="2316.135" id=c_"2316.135">__Miles__</span> Davis, you know, who are these people you know about Lester Young and why he, he evolved the way he did, you know? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So you know about the players, the musicians, you, you know about the language, and you are, you are asked to improvise very early with all that. I don't think ego has a lot of space. I, I don't think. Right. You know, that's my assumption. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's very, very interesting. That's, that's an interesting view on it. I, I hadn't thought of it quite in that way, but that's, that's an important view of it. Now, I'm curious, you have a number of sort of like parallel lines that you're pursuing and or exploring or, or learning more about. How are you planning, what is your imagination for how you're going to combine your electronic music studies, your work with the saxophone, your history with, with very conservative and classical musics, but also your, your interest in experimentalism? How do you combine all these into the work of the future? What's the thing that you're looking at now as being kind of the thing that brings these things together? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Coralie: </b>I think it's not very complicated. And I mean, I never really had to formalize it. But as now as you ask me, I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now you have to, right 
</p>

<p>
<b>Coralie: </b><laugh>. Yeah. But it's not so complicated. Actually. I could probably say, well, I'm going to forget about composition because I don't have the time and I don't have the time, but I'm, I'm not able to, I'm going to forget about this for a while and focus on, you know, just electronic music, whatever. But there are things I see on the long term, and there are things I see on the short term. Right now I'm, I'm working on an installation and it kinds of, maybe it's a bit naive or maybe it's not the right way to see it, but I, I tend to try and gather most of the things I know and implement them in a work. But it's also because to me, it's all one coherent project. So I'm working on an installation that involves a lot of things I'm interested in about micro intervals, perception and, and composition, but also physical modeling. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Coralie: </b>And, and it has a lot of, yeah, it's mostly based on, on, on MaxMSP, also libraries that, that, well, tools that are used for physical modeling and that have been integrated under, under the form of libraries for <span style="color:red" data-ts="2469.445" data-end_ts="2469.645" title="2469.445" id=c_"2469.445">__mac__</span>. So it's very convenient. There is interaction involved, with boats. And it's a project that I've <span style="color:red" data-ts="2476.245" data-end_ts="2476.365" title="2476.245" id=c_"2476.245">__be__</span>, I've had in mind since a few years now. And, and that now I'm, I have to now put my, my hands in the dirt and, and, you know, really produce sounds and, and, and implement it. So, installation I think is a very interesting media because it allows me to think in terms of composition and also <span style="color:red" data-ts="2496.185" data-end_ts="2496.405" title="2496.185" id=c_"2496.185">__el__</span> Yeah. But at the level of electronic music perception, I think is a, a very strong thing. It's something I studied in the conservatory when I, when I was, doing, studying, singing at the same time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Coralie: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So I work on a, on a solo, on a saxophone solo project. On one hand, I am still, I, I put a great deal of great care in, in, in being able to improvise without anything else but my saxophone. So I still have this approach of, questioning the language itself, but also I'm, I'm thinking of electronics and, but in a way that makes sense for a saxophone. Like I base myself on tools that allow to analyze the sound of the saxophone in terms of perception. Again, I am still focused on the same things in the saxophone as a tool for Saxon Electronics as the things you would find in my installation. So I, I would work on, on very limited areas of, of sounds such as micro intervals, you know, textures that like roughness. There is a difference between sacs and, and installations, of course, but the teams I tackle are quite similar. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Coralie: </b>I have started again, taking composition classes, so it's strange, but, so I take a pen and a paper, and really I do, I started back to where I was when I was a teenager, basically. And I have the aim, but, and I know that will take time. So I'm thinking <span style="color:red" data-ts="2595.005" data-end_ts="2595.205" title="2595.005" id=c_"2595.005">__on__</span>, on the long term, my aim is to be able to, master again the techniques of counterpoint. And I'm really thinking of like Middle Ages and, and Renaissance and because they, they would do things that were incredible at the time, right? So when I have time, I still know read the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2612.755" data-end_ts="2613.045" title="2612.755" id=c_"2612.755">__Bach__</span> choral music, and I really hope that I am strong enough in a few years to be able to write contemporary music that is just based on, you know, the pen and the paper, but also apply the language to processes that that could, be and that that need electronic to be, to be implemented. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Coralie: </b>And that's more a long-term project that I have. So that's it. And, and teaching is, is probably the perfect way for me to, to think of all these projects together. Because I, when I teach music, I have <span style="color:red" data-ts="2651.725" data-end_ts="2651.845" title="2651.725" id=c_"2651.725">__a__</span> wonderful young or adult students that really tell me a lot about myself and that they really make me feel like teaching new things. So I think I could, you know, teach, counterpoint and harmony to kids and, and, and that would probably, you know, make me feel more confident about writing music. So, yeah. And I, I intend also to learn to teach, electronic music to children who are like piano players or, you know, but because in France, it's very seldom that that children are given the opportunity to code. And especially if they are not in a scientific background. Like when you're a musician in France, you are just a musician, you Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>No creative coding, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Coralie: </b>Yeah, yeah, yeah. And, and it's like only been a few, like 2, 3, 5, yeah. Five years maybe that, musicians in the conservatory have the possibility to do a PhD. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. You can't do a PhD otherwise. Interesting. I mean, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2714.125" data-end_ts="2714.325" title="2714.125" id=c_"2714.125">__if__</span> you're a musician, it doesn't exist. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, well this sounds, sounds amazing. It sounds like you're putting together a remarkable future. And man, there's like four other things I was hoping to talk to you about. We'll have to save it for another time though, because our time is up. Okay. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2730.225" data-end_ts="2730.645" title="2730.225" id=c_"2730.225">__Corley__</span>, I want to thank you so much for your time. It was a pleasure talking to you and getting to know not only more about you, but more about your thought processes and how you think your way through some of these, some of these issues is really quite fascinating. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Coralie: </b><laugh>, thanks. I, I didn't expect that. And, it's, it was very interesting. Yeah, it's, it's nice you gave me the opportunity to think about what I do. It's, it's really nice. Well, 
</p>

<p>

<b>Darwin: </b>Many thanks to Coral <span style="color:red" data-ts="2778.185" data-end_ts="2778.405" title="2778.185" id=c_"2778.185">__Lee__</span> for spending the time talking with us. Really interesting to hear how her brain works and how she thinks about organization and language and, how she likes combining things together to make great holes. Very interesting stuff. I wanna thank you the listener, for continuing to tune in, and keeping her to ground. Pretty soon I'm gonna be providing you with some information on some releases, that I might be doing. So hopefully that comes together. If it does, you'll be the first to hear about it. Thanks a lot, and we'll catch you next week. Bye.
