<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. This week I'm very happy to introduce you to someone that, was introduced to me by my friend Matthew Davidson. His name is John <span style="color:red" data-ts="16.72" data-end_ts="16.96" title="16.72" id=c_"16.72">__Luke__</span> Cohen Sinclair, who <span style="color:red" data-ts="19.38" data-end_ts="19.6" title="19.38" id=c_"19.38">__is__</span>, who works, as an instructor at Berkeley with Matthew, but also has a fantastic and very interesting kind of area of interest. And so, I'm anxious to share that with you. And, let's say hi to Jean-Luc. Jean-Luc. <span style="color:red" data-ts="36.08" data-end_ts="36.24" title="36.08" id=c_"36.08">__Hi__</span>, how are you this morning? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Luc Cohen-Sinclair: </b>I'm great. Great, thank you. Darwin 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thank you very much for taking the time to, talk with us. Why don't we kick it off by having you, tell people a little bit about the work that you do? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Luc: </b>Sure. I'd be happy to. Well, currently I've, I'm focusing on an area which, relates to gaming, but also goes beyond audio for games, which is procedural, audio procedural sound design, which is still somewhat nacent, I think in, as an art form. And that, as <span style="color:red" data-ts="73.27" data-end_ts="73.43" title="73.27" id=c_"73.27">__an__</span> name implies, it's really the, the art of creating sounds, by, through the use of mathematical models, and, and creating sound objects, which can actually be used in many ways to create hopefully, realistic sounds, sound effects, but also <span style="color:red" data-ts="95.87" data-end_ts="96.07" title="95.87" id=c_"95.87">__entirely__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="96.13" data-end_ts="96.35" title="96.13" id=c_"96.13">__new__</span> sounds, with applications for music and composition too. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You have got a pretty interesting, you have a pretty interesting history with, with sound design. You've actually done some work in the video game world to this point, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Luc: </b>Yes. <span style="color:red" data-ts="115.02" data-end_ts="115.31" title="115.02" id=c_"115.02">__Past__</span> few years I've started to, to do more, work more as a consultant. I was working with, with video games, <span style="color:red" data-ts="122.93" data-end_ts="123.15" title="122.93" id=c_"122.93">__but__</span> I was still in undergrad, at Berkeley. And, initially I was doing a lot of, <span style="color:red" data-ts="131.05" data-end_ts="131.47" title="131.05" id=c_"131.05">__search__</span> translations, or localization from, English to French. And that sort of led me into an area that was really fascinating to me because I, I, I grew up with video games, you know, I, I had <span style="color:red" data-ts="143.71" data-end_ts="143.79" title="143.71" id=c_"143.71">__an__</span> entire 2,600 console as a kid that I probably spent more time <span style="color:red" data-ts="147.89" data-end_ts="148.11" title="147.89" id=c_"147.89">__and__</span> with any of my friends <laugh>. So, so I was, I was very early on like, into games. So when I was able to realize that, well, there's something that can be done using both of these passions of mine, that was pretty exciting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, no doubt. Well, why don't, why don't we do, generally in my podcast, one of the things I like to do is to talk to people and have them give us a little, hint of their background and how they became the artists that they are. I'm curious about how you, how you kind of pull these things together. So why don't, why don't, why don't you do that? Why don't you tell us how, what's your background and how did you get to be the guy you are today? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Luc: </b>Sure. Well, so I, I think that, it really, it really goes way back to, to my, my first video game console, which I must have gotten when I was maybe six years old. I was pretty early on in the, in the gaming world, and, and, and that that was, you know, the moment I got, <span style="color:red" data-ts="215.9" data-end_ts="216.02" title="215.9" id=c_"215.9">__I__</span> got that my, my life sort of changed forever. And I spent many, many hours, in, in front of it, going to, to arcades as well. And, as soon as I grew a little bit older, like <span style="color:red" data-ts="233" data-end_ts="233.22" title="233" id=c_"233">__to__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="233.22" data-end_ts="233.38" title="233.22" id=c_"233.22">__be__</span> like around 10 or 11, when I started to, to be a bit more curious, I, I got into computer programming. And, and that was really, really fascinating to me. I, I started to, to learn, like teaching myself some basic and some other, like pascal and these old languages. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Luc: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="252.81" data-end_ts="253.1" title="252.81" id=c_"252.81">__Well__</span>, at the same time, my mother was insistent that I would, learn music and I had no interest whatsoever in, becoming a musician. But eventually I, I relented and, gave in. I came in under pressure and, it turns out that I really loved it. She wanted me to play the piano, and actually, I, I wanted to play the organ because, early I really liked the music of, of, of Bach. And, and I felt like, you know, I, I could, I could do that. I could learn to play that and, and be pretty happy. And, and so after about maybe a year or two, I, I started to tinker more with sound and, and computers very, very simply at first, you know, just kind of making little melodies or modifying little melodies on, on, on what was my arms <span style="color:red" data-ts="310.87" data-end_ts="311.19" title="310.87" id=c_"310.87">__strike__</span> computer, which was a British maid computer, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Luc: </b>Which was <span style="color:red" data-ts="315.3" data-end_ts="315.91" title="315.3" id=c_"315.3">__somewhere__</span> popular in Europe. And, and I really can't afford a while moved away from computer programming as a whole because I also realized that, I could use computers to actually record music. 'cause I started to get more and more into, into not just learning <span style="color:red" data-ts="340.73" data-end_ts="340.95" title="340.73" id=c_"340.73">__not__</span> to play the organ, but, the idea of, you know, working with sequencers and midi. So I, I eventually traded my old computer for an Atari, a 10 40, <span style="color:red" data-ts="351.81" data-end_ts="352.03" title="351.81" id=c_"351.81">__but__</span> Cubase 1.0 and an keyboard. And, and then I, I probably just, you know, didn't leave my bedroom, unless it was, you know, to go to class for the next three years, just <laugh> sequencing music as much as I could. So that, that was one of the ways that these world came together for me. And I even kinda gave up gaming at that point, because there was only so many hours in the day, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Luc: </b>But, deciding that I <span style="color:red" data-ts="384.86" data-end_ts="385.02" title="384.86" id=c_"384.86">__then__</span> made the decision that I wanted to study music, beyond, what I was doing, at the conservatory in my hometown, which is right outside of Paris. I, I applied to Berkeley and I think I enrolled there in 1993. Spent the first two years just going through the same program pretty much as everybody does. And, you know, until I, I took the CSUN class with, Dr. <span style="color:red" data-ts="407.77" data-end_ts="408.06" title="407.77" id=c_"407.77">__Boer__</span>, who remains one of my mentors to this day. And that sort of brought me right back to this idea of computer programming, which I really, really enjoyed and, brought in the synthesis dimension. And being able to generate sounds purely from synthesis was really exciting to me. <span style="color:red" data-ts="428.84" data-end_ts="429.06" title="428.84" id=c_"428.84">__But__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="429.06" data-end_ts="429.1" title="429.06" id=c_"429.06">__at__</span> the same time, I started to get freelance work for a company that was in Boston called Looking Less Technologies, which is no longer around to do some work on, on games. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Luc: </b>And, and at that point, <span style="color:red" data-ts="443.92" data-end_ts="444.14" title="443.92" id=c_"443.92">__so__</span> like the pieces of the puzzle were falling into place, that sort of gave me a good sense of the direction I wanted to take. From that point on, after that, I got a master's at <span style="color:red" data-ts="457.32" data-end_ts="457.54" title="457.32" id=c_"457.32">__Cat__</span> Arts in Composition, and I really spent a lot of time, way more time at that point focusing on, on programming, and synthesis. And I was really lucky because at the time I was able to study with Nik with <span style="color:red" data-ts="471.42" data-end_ts="471.7" title="471.42" id=c_"471.42">__some__</span> Herb, some really fantastic people, right. And, and so that was a really sort <span style="color:red" data-ts="479.02" data-end_ts="479.14" title="479.02" id=c_"479.02">__of__</span> golden opportunity. And while I was doing that, I was doing a lot of, work for, <span style="color:red" data-ts="485.53" data-end_ts="485.82" title="485.53" id=c_"485.53">__some__</span> multimedia, anywhere from, you know, doing programming for online games to, authoring d <span style="color:red" data-ts="493.46" data-end_ts="493.62" title="493.46" id=c_"493.46">__video__</span> D audios, and video disks. So, that was sort of what I was doing until the point I graduated when I started to do more sound design, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="502.02" data-end_ts="502.18" title="502.02" id=c_"502.02">__so__</span> post-production work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Luc: </b>And one day I actually got a call, from a friend of mine asking me if I wouldn't mind sending him a CD for this job that, this gig really, that he, had heard of, but he couldn't tell me what it was for. And <laugh> long story longer, hopefully not. <span style="color:red" data-ts="520.32" data-end_ts="520.54" title="520.32" id=c_"520.32">__We__</span>, long story <span style="color:red" data-ts="520.9" data-end_ts="521.14" title="520.9" id=c_"520.9">__short__</span>, it was, it, it, it was, for, for <span style="color:red" data-ts="524.38" data-end_ts="524.58" title="524.38" id=c_"524.38">__tr__</span> Resner who was looking for help doing Doom three, we were <span style="color:red" data-ts="528.3" data-end_ts="528.5" title="528.3" id=c_"528.3">__pro__</span>, he was prototyping the <span style="color:red" data-ts="529.62" data-end_ts="529.78" title="529.62" id=c_"529.62">__sounds__</span> for Doom three at the time. I see. And, and because I had a background <span style="color:red" data-ts="535.2" data-end_ts="535.48" title="535.2" id=c_"535.2">__boost__</span> in sound design and sort of, computer science and video games, you know, that, that sort of worked out pretty well. <span style="color:red" data-ts="543.02" data-end_ts="543.24" title="543.02" id=c_"543.02">__It__</span> very naturally fell into place, and that was obviously very exciting. And I, I loved the <span style="color:red" data-ts="548" data-end_ts="548.16" title="548" id=c_"548">__Tune__</span> franchise. I was a big fan of his work of <span style="color:red" data-ts="550.34" data-end_ts="550.56" title="550.34" id=c_"550.34">__re__</span> Ners work. Right. And I remember very vividly, well doing the, the sound design for the first level of the game that one of the rooms in which you walked in had this, this barrel, because all video games must have barrels and them. But, <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Luc: </b>I think it's, I think it's an unwritten law <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Luc: </b>But <span style="color:red" data-ts="576.63" data-end_ts="576.92" title="576.63" id=c_"576.63">__what__</span>, but this one was special, and it was special because it actually had physics properties built into it, meaning that, you know, you could push it down a flight of stairs and it would fall down differently every time. Okay. And that made me stop for a minute, because up until that point, you know, the, the work that you would do, traditionally for sound design, in games was fairly predictable. I'm sure there was an interactive element there, but, but while you could never quite predict how and when the sounds would be triggered, they would usually sound the same way every time, or with, you know, slight variation <span style="color:red" data-ts="612" data-end_ts="612.2" title="612" id=c_"612">__that__</span> the future <span style="color:red" data-ts="612.59" data-end_ts="612.88" title="612.59" id=c_"612.59">__that__</span> we would use to make them less repetitive. Right. This was the first time that I sort of became aware of the fact that there was a major disconnect between the way where, <span style="color:red" data-ts="623.1" data-end_ts="623.32" title="623.1" id=c_"623.1">__or__</span> I should say the place the technology was, when it came to visuals and when it came to audio and gaming and beyond. Meaning that we could now create virtual environments that behave fairly realistically that we're starting to, but we were still playing back samples, essentially just static photographs of sound that we were layering underneath. And while we did find a way to make it, make it work, it was a workaround that was very obvious to me. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Luc: </b>You know, having a background in, in, in Sea Sound and in, in programming, I guess the seed was planted there, then that, there was an area of, of research there that had been large, largely left untouched until that point. And so that's one of, you could say, I guess the, the experience that really triggered this, this interest or spark <span style="color:red" data-ts="680.52" data-end_ts="680.72" title="680.52" id=c_"680.52">__that__</span> interest in me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Well, that's, yeah, that's really an interesting trail, but it's also, it also leaves me with about 10,000 questions here, so I'm gonna kind of launch into a few of them. Let's, let's reel all the way back. First of all, to you getting started with, you said it was an amt computer first. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Luc: </b>Correct. Actually, my very, very first was, technically a St. CLA ZX 81. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, yeah. Which is my first one as well, actually. Yep. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Luc: </b>You know exactly what I'm talking about then. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, I do. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="717.66" data-end_ts="717.88" title="717.66" id=c_"717.66">__was__</span> it the, wasn't the Amstrad kind of like, the super version of the Sinclair, or was it somehow I have those two, like linked in my head in some way? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Luc: </b>I, I, I think a lot of these computer companies actually went back and forth, and the designs were fairly similar, but yes, the Ons stat was the, sort of gaming version of it Right. A few years later. And I was really geared more toward gaming. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, okay. So, alright, from there you went to the Atari 10 40 and, you know, I have to say that I'm, I'm pretty fascinated. I, I did not have an Atari. I, that was at a time when I, my vision was focused in a different direction, but I'm amazed at the number of people, both, the number of people in the music community who got their start with the 10 40, and particularly with the 10 40 and Cubase one, much the way that you stated. Now, my question is, given that you were coming from a background where computers were mostly gaming devices, to what extent was the fact that Cubase kind of felt like a game version of making music that had something to do with your, you developing a fascination with it? Because I felt like those early sequencers, I, when I first interacted with the computer sequencer, I was fascinated because it did sort of feel like a game and sort of felt like you were trying to solve puzzles, how to get from this key change to that key change mm-hmm. <affirmative> and stuff like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Luc: </b>Oh, absolutely. I think you're, you're spot in there. It, it very much felt like a game. <span style="color:red" data-ts="818.7" data-end_ts="818.92" title="818.7" id=c_"818.7">__So__</span> it was, to me it was a gaming environment. It was a, that's pretty much what I had done with computers for the most part. Even, you know, to some extent, when I was programming, it was still for, for fun. Sure. And it, it felt, you know, it was very interactive, obviously. There was a lot of features which were, again, as you pointed out, almost like solving a puzzle. There was an element of it, which had to do with <span style="color:red" data-ts="843.78" data-end_ts="844" title="843.78" id=c_"843.78">__me__</span>, which was new and exciting as well. And there was a element <span style="color:red" data-ts="847.06" data-end_ts="847.28" title="847.06" id=c_"847.06">__of__</span> it, which had to do with troubleshooting and learning these new technologies. So it, it was a very playful way to, to get into <span style="color:red" data-ts="854.8" data-end_ts="854.96" title="854.8" id=c_"854.8">__media__</span> technology. And, and it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="857.33" data-end_ts="857.68" title="857.33" id=c_"857.33">__kinda__</span> remained that way to a large extent for me, which is probably why I'm still doing it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, you're right. It's, it's a playful way of doing, of almost sneaking into the process of composition and also one of, of helping people engage in music in a, in a way other than their mom yelling at 'em to go practice piano after <span style="color:red" data-ts="879.06" data-end_ts="879.48" title="879.06" id=c_"879.06">__dinner__</span> right after. Now I find it. Yeah. I find it interesting that your gaze moved to the organ, and what kind of organ was it that you were using? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Luc: </b>Well, I, at home I had had, one of these, early Yamaha electrons. Okay. Organ. So it was a, it was an electronic organ to, to practice on. There was a small, type organ that <span style="color:red" data-ts="902.48" data-end_ts="902.64" title="902.48" id=c_"902.48">__we__</span> had access to once in a while at the conservatory. And, <span style="color:red" data-ts="905.82" data-end_ts="906.04" title="905.82" id=c_"905.82">__it__</span>, it was actually more of a elaborate harmonium, like, you know, one of right. These like, but but I think that the reason that that was important to me, was a, because of the music <span style="color:red" data-ts="916.6" data-end_ts="916.88" title="916.6" id=c_"916.6">__that__</span> I was attracted to, which was black, I also enjoyed the sound of it very much. And, and that was to me more interesting than the pianos for some 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Reason. Right. That's, that's what I wanted to ask about in the Organ, to me, was one of the first instruments that you could actually do sort of elementary sound design on. Right. So I, my start was with a church organ, but a draw bar, Hammond organ, right, mm-hmm. <affirmative>. But later on we got, you know, at the church they also got, you know, a typical Lowry organ with all the different flutes and clarinets and stuff like that. But even in that case, you had the ability, first of all to play around with the contours of the sound using the volume pedals mm-hmm. <span style="color:red" data-ts="966.04" data-end_ts="966.08" title="966.04" id=c_"966.04">__<affirmative>__</span>. And you can also mix the sounds in sort of unique ways. And, and I found it a really, it was one of those things that really caught my ear as an interesting way to approach sound. To what extent did the organ do that for you? Or, or how did, how did that end up being sort of an introduction into synthesis for you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Luc: </b>It, it, it was, it absolutely was, <span style="color:red" data-ts="992.38" data-end_ts="992.6" title="992.38" id=c_"992.38">__in__</span>, in a way I, you could say that I sort of learned music and synthesis at the same time in parallel. Mm. Because the experience of learning music was very early on associated with, some element of sound design, some way of manipulating the sound of mixing different sounds together. So that was, in retrospect, of course, it's, it's something that seems <span style="color:red" data-ts="1018.29" data-end_ts="1018.64" title="1018.29" id=c_"1018.29">__quite__</span> a little obvious now, but at the time, I had no idea that there was other ways to learn about music, but it seemed like there was yet another level of interest to me. I liked making these different sounds, and I also liked having another level of, you know, creative freedom, sure. In deciding what, what the song would be like for that particular piece, for this particular piece. So it was very much, an element, that led me into sound design early on. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And so then your, your travels take you to Berkeley, and the person who another one of these, like central characters in so many of the people I talk to is the amazing Dr. B. I badly want to get an interview with him because I, I would say fully half of the people that I've interviewed mm-hmm. <affirmative> to this point, have in one way or another, say, well, Dr. B did this for me, <laugh>, you know, <laugh>, he's an amazingly influential person. And his introduction of C sound to you sounds like it was, it was sort of the, the place where programming and music really coalesced for you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Luc: </b>Yes, absolutely. And, yes, Dr B is definitely an amazing and sens character to, to our community. And, and I'm not surprised that so many people mention him in your interviews having been introduced to C Sound. I, again, was, was really the time where I, let me just back up a little bit. I, I always felt somewhat frustrated, when I was at the organ that, I could never play something between <span style="color:red" data-ts="1119.44" data-end_ts="1119.72" title="1119.44" id=c_"1119.44">__Sarah__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1119.88" data-end_ts="1120" title="1119.88" id=c_"1119.88">__C__</span> and the T <span style="color:red" data-ts="1120.36" data-end_ts="1120.56" title="1120.36" id=c_"1120.36">__shot__</span>. Oh, yes. That, that was one of my frustrations. I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1125.56" data-end_ts="1125.8" title="1125.56" id=c_"1125.56">__loved__</span> that I could change the sound, but I felt that there was something there which I knew I wanted to access and I didn't have access to. So, when I took <span style="color:red" data-ts="1137.64" data-end_ts="1138.06" title="1137.64" id=c_"1137.64">__Doctor__</span> B csun class, a, it was a way for me to sort of reconcile my love of programming and, and music and synthesis, but <span style="color:red" data-ts="1148.27" data-end_ts="1148.47" title="1148.27" id=c_"1148.27">__did__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1148.47" data-end_ts="1148.67" title="1148.47" id=c_"1148.47">__it__</span> also gave me complete freedom over what was gonna be played when, of course, it required, required quite a bit of work initially, you know, and we're still talking about a time which did require some, some rendering time for some basic stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Luc: </b>In fact, I got, I remember getting basic cable by place because it would take seven hours to render <laugh> a piece <span style="color:red" data-ts="1174.57" data-end_ts="1174.79" title="1174.57" id=c_"1174.57">__on__</span>, you know, and, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So you had to have something to do <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Luc: </b>Yeah, exactly. Because I, I, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Luc: </b>I had nothing else to, well, I'm sure I had other things to do, but, but, as far as forms of entertainment, things were severely limited because some of the pieces would take seven hours to render. And, so, so that was, that was the impetus leader of, be getting basic cable. But, but that, that really was pretty, pretty well in terms of all the possibilities that it opened up all of a sudden. And for a while, the only way that I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1211.5" data-end_ts="1211.82" title="1211.5" id=c_"1211.5">__relate__</span> to music was, through, through code, for at least a couple of years. And that, that was something that I, an experience that I, I could not, I, I can't emphasize enough how, crucial that was to, to making me want to, to pursue that field. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, how did that, how did that, or what other classes maybe that you took, how did those things set you up for the sound design work that you ended up doing, with your consulting work and eventually with, on the Doom three, project? What, what were the things that were sort of like essential tools to get you there? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Luc: </b>There was, there was <span style="color:red" data-ts="1263.48" data-end_ts="1263.6" title="1263.48" id=c_"1263.48">__a__</span>, a Class by Neil Leonard, which was, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1266.02" data-end_ts="1266.24" title="1266.02" id=c_"1266.02">__is__</span> multimedia class, which was also pretty central in terms of giving me tools that I could use, to, to bring in different mediums together. And, and at the time we would learn, director and, and Premier, to, to do interactive, basic, interactive programming, and, and video manipulation. So, so those two classes gave me a lot of tools in terms of being able to pursue, what with turned out to be <span style="color:red" data-ts="1301.8" data-end_ts="1301.92" title="1301.8" id=c_"1301.8">__a__</span>, a career after, after Berkeley. And certainly gave me a direction also for, for, for graduate work, that I wanted to pursue. I, I sort of felt like I left Berkeley, and maybe most people feel that way in terms of, you know, getting your undergrad. I sort of felt like I, I was done with my undergrad, but I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1319.68" data-end_ts="1319.84" title="1319.68" id=c_"1319.68">__had__</span> more questions. Right. That answers. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That actually does seem like a, like a common thing, especially for people coming outta Berkeley. And, and I've had the, I've had the, the pleasure of speaking to a number of people who got their undergrad education at Berkeley, you know, certainly Matthew, but also like Keith Fuller <span style="color:red" data-ts="1341.2" data-end_ts="1341.32" title="1341.2" id=c_"1341.2">__and__</span> Whitman mm-hmm. <affirmative> and some other folks. And, unlike a lot of schools, there seems to be something about Berkeley, first of all, that helps people find work <laugh>, which is a pretty, a pretty significant deal, right. But, but also there's something about it that, where everybody says, it was hard, it was incredibly hard, but I came out of there hungrier than when I went in, which is actually kind of an interesting twist because so often people come out of their undergrad never wanting to think about that area of study again. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Luc: </b>That's, that's a very good point. I, I, in fact, I would say both these points to me have been very true. I think Berkeley does do a very good job actually of, of, setting people up for, for, for a career. Much more students than the other schools I've, I've either taught at or, or, or <span style="color:red" data-ts="1395.95" data-end_ts="1396.15" title="1395.95" id=c_"1395.95">__deals__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1396.23" data-end_ts="1396.43" title="1396.23" id=c_"1396.23">__with__</span>. But, but I think that, it also, it also creates, yes, more questions than answers, not because the education there is not, is not fantastic just because it is, I think, in a way, so great that you just don't want the experience to stop. And, and you, you often, and I certain felt that way, obviously you, you leave, that there's far more to this particular topic, whatever your field of interest is than you even suspected initially. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. It, it's, it's interesting because I think that music and particularly music technology is one of those things that from the outside looks like a rather small area of interest, but it's one of those, it's one of those areas where the deeper you get in the more details you see, . <affirmative> recently, I, for a class that I was teaching, I introduced them to the little documentary about, you, you could find it online. It's about Curtis Rhodes and his, kind of perspective on, his own personal journey into granular synthesis. And, you know, I talked to the class afterwards and they were like amazed that, you know, here was a little sub-genre of a sub-genre of a subset of music technology. And here was this guy who was able to dedicate his life to it, and it really opened up their eyes to how deep you could get into this stuff. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Luc: </b>Absolutely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It, it seems like that's one of the things that Berkeley does is it opens the door for people to start considering that the fact that there's a lot more depth that's available. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Luc: </b>Absolutely. And especially in, in, in, you know, I think you're right, specifically in music technology. There are so many potential areas of studies, that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1522.2" data-end_ts="1522.36" title="1522.2" id=c_"1522.2">__have__</span> still been for some of them, not quite fully explored to <span style="color:red" data-ts="1526.82" data-end_ts="1527.04" title="1526.82" id=c_"1526.82">__say__</span> the least. That, it is I think, a great way for somebody, who actually has an interest in, in subject in the first place to realize the full potential, that there is to dedicating one's life journey, to one particular area, or at least to dedicate <span style="color:red" data-ts="1548.04" data-end_ts="1548.16" title="1548.04" id=c_"1548.04">__a__</span> very large portion of time to an area which they may not have even been aware of before, entering the program. Curtis is obviously a fantastic example of that, and, and, you know, so, so pivotal in the work that he's been able to do. But in a way that's, you know, as you know, that's one of the many examples. And that's something that I'm, I'm very grateful for. I would also think that, you know, it is still an area which lends itself to research, as you know, and, and that in itself sometimes is exciting. The fact that it is in fact still a research heavy area, which has very practical applications, but it's constantly evolving, I think, as an holds appeal in itself. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So you talked about the idea of procedural sound design, and particularly the way that this barrel in doom sort of like opened your head to a new way of thinking about sound design, which I, I think is actually an apt <span style="color:red" data-ts="1610.96" data-end_ts="1611.08" title="1610.96" id=c_"1610.96">__to__</span> description because first of all, all, all of us can visualize exactly what you're talking about, even if we haven't worked on Doom three, and I'm afraid I probably spent too much of my life on that thing 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Luc: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But, you know, even, even without that, everybody's kind of seen that kind of activity and the fact that now these physics engines are making it so that the visual aspects of, video gaming and, and visual display, make things non, non-direct or indirect. You know, we don't control every bounce and every movement of the barrel as it goes down the stairs. And so that does bring us to talking about the idea of procedural sound design. Where are people even talking about this stuff? I think the only, the only thing that I've actually run across that is like a book about the subject, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1667.54" data-end_ts="1667.76" title="1667.54" id=c_"1667.54">__and__</span> I'm trying to remember the name of it. I think it's called The Nature of Code, or something like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Luc: </b>Yes, that's believe so actually, because there actually are some resources available now. Not very many, honestly. Still, I mean, we're in 2015, and you would think I, I would've thought anyway that it would be a lot more by now. There is a fantastic book called Designing Sound by Andy Farnel. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. By Farne. That's right. I forgot about that book. Yes. I actually even have that on my shelf. I can't believe I didn't think of that right away too. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Luc: </b>That is a fantastic book. And that's still, it still is, I think the only, systematic study of sound design, and procedural audio, that I've found out there that is so comprehensive and from such a practical standpoint as well. And there's definitely some other research that's been going on in the field. Director indirectly, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1727.41" data-end_ts="1727.76" title="1727.41" id=c_"1727.41">__Perry__</span> Cook did quite a bit of work in that area to, I think in the nineties was already talking about possibility of generating sound, like footsteps using ular synthesis. Right. There's, Nicola <span style="color:red" data-ts="1740.6" data-end_ts="1740.8" title="1740.6" id=c_"1740.6">__Ell__</span>, who, works for, Sony Europe for many years in trying to preach the idea and doing some research <span style="color:red" data-ts="1751.18" data-end_ts="1751.4" title="1751.18" id=c_"1751.18">__on__</span> the topic of procedural audio. However you are correct, there aren't very many resources, available on, on the subject. And most of the interest that I've seen, and the research definitely has come from academia. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Luc: </b>And I think there's a number of reasons besides the inherent nature of, you know, academia being a place that will concentrate research. Part of it is that there is a resistance for a better word, coming from the gaming community, but not only to this, this concept of procedural audio. And I think that has to do with a bit of a catch 22, which is, well, there <span style="color:red" data-ts="1790.54" data-end_ts="1790.76" title="1790.54" id=c_"1790.54">__is__</span>, first of all, the fact that it's a new way of leading to sound design. Right. One which in serving traditional post-production environment is completely foreign, which is not to say that there is not an art form, of course, to doing sound design, in this way. I mean, we all know that doing some film can, it is an art form that can take a lifetime to, to master. Right. But we are talking still about layering samples together in, in a way I relate to it more as a music concrete approach, which is <span style="color:red" data-ts="1827.65" data-end_ts="1828" title="1827.65" id=c_"1827.65">__sound__</span> collage and mixing sounds together. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Luc: </b>And if you really think about it, the techniques that were outlined by the pioneers of music concrete are still more or less the techniques that we use, albeit a lot more developed with obviously much, much better tools. But these are still some techniques, essentially, that we use to create sound for, for film, for TV and so forth in gaming, which you would think would be a much more say, open world to changes in technology and technological advancement that actually has, a very, very difficult time making its way into the workflow. A because, well, a lot of the people that came into gaming initially come from traditional post-production <span style="color:red" data-ts="1875.53" data-end_ts="1875.88" title="1875.53" id=c_"1875.53">__vanet__</span>. So, so there wasn't necessarily like this way of thinking that was part of their training also, because there is a bit of a misconception, or this sort of catch 22, which is, well, you know, the problem with procedural audio is that it's very promising, but it doesn't sound that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1895.04" data-end_ts="1895.24" title="1895.04" id=c_"1895.04">__great__</span>, which is not actually necessarily true. We have now some very convincing models of, of sounds which are extremely helpful. I teach a class on procedural audio <span style="color:red" data-ts="1905.5" data-end_ts="1905.72" title="1905.5" id=c_"1905.5">__at__</span>, at Berkeley. I taught the, the first prototype of it last year, and I had students make all the sounds, two or three, two <span style="color:red" data-ts="1913.92" data-end_ts="1914.16" title="1913.92" id=c_"1913.92">__second__</span>, two minute long video using procedural <span style="color:red" data-ts="1915.8" data-end_ts="1916" title="1915.8" id=c_"1915.8">__sun__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1916" data-end_ts="1916.36" title="1916" id=c_"1916">__design__</span>. And, and we've, I, I was surprised at how well some of work came out 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Luc: </b>You know, I I, they, they kind of blew my mind for some of them, but you know, this idea that, well, you know, procedural sunshine doesn't sound that great. So, you know, maybe it's not worth spending our time. To me, it's a little bit like saying in 1906, cars are great, but horses are so much faster and so much more reliable. Like, what's the point in developing cars? <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. That's a great way to twist that. I love it. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Luc: </b>So, you know, I, I, I, I definitely see or understand why there, there has been this reluctance, right, for a greater push toward procedural audio mm-hmm. <affirmative>, but by, at the same time, I think we're, we're doing ourselves a disservice. And, you know, when you compare how far we've gone on the visual and physics side of things and how many of these advances that happened in the past 20 years exponentially, for that matter, and audio hasn't quite kept up. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now to, to what extent do you think, though, that some of that has to do with the game, the game community and particularly the business of gaming? So, I've had some experience in working with gaming companies, and there have been a couple of things that actually sort of hampered interacting or <span style="color:red" data-ts="2000.34" data-end_ts="2000.56" title="2000.34" id=c_"2000.34">__in__</span> engaging the sound design like I wanted to do with what they were doing. And it was particularly related to a few things. First of all, a lot of times with procedural sound work, it's very difficult to say, here's the exact amount of C P U I'm going to use when generating this sound. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, that's something that the game people can't handle because they need, they have sort of like this, this way they think of, of game performance as being a budget. You know, they budget a certain amount of C P U or G P U access for, the visuals and another certain percent for the ai. And, another percent, and then, you know, a very tiny, tiny percent for, the sound, which is kind of funny because to me, and, and maybe it's because I'm focused on the sound side of things, to me, sound is a critical, critical part of making an environment seem real. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Luc: </b>Absolutely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But it seems like they don't budget very much time or money for that part of reality. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Luc: </b>Absolutely. You're, you're 100% correct. So I, I, I also teach at N Y U where I, I do some of the, the gaming courses there and the music tech department. And one of the things that we've been doing is, you know, grab a, a game, which is, you know, small to medium size, game, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2092.47" data-end_ts="2092.69" title="2092.47" id=c_"2092.47">__so__</span> like casual gaming type and replacing all the sound, but also increasing or improving, I should say, the implementation, how the sounds are triggered, when they're triggered and so forth. Okay. And the difference in how engaging the gameplay is, is night and day Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Luc: </b>To us, sound people. I think it's, it's, it's an obvious, it's a given that, you know, sound will make your environment believable, and more engaging. But you are, you <span style="color:red" data-ts="2123.41" data-end_ts="2123.49" title="2123.41" id=c_"2123.41">__are__</span> absolutely correct. I, I find that to this day, there are companies that don't really see the point in investing a lot in, in, in audio. And that has been an issue when you're mentioning the topic of C P U Power and this, budgeting idea, which is very much how the gaming community relates to C <span style="color:red" data-ts="2145.24" data-end_ts="2145.36" title="2145.24" id=c_"2145.24">__P__</span> U power. That's another issue, which I would argue is becoming less so of initiative <span style="color:red" data-ts="2150.6" data-end_ts="2150.84" title="2150.6" id=c_"2150.6">__space__</span>, depending on what you're trying to do. And by that, I mean, some models can be very, very taxing on A C <span style="color:red" data-ts="2157.72" data-end_ts="2157.84" title="2157.72" id=c_"2157.72">__P__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2157.84" data-end_ts="2157.92" title="2157.84" id=c_"2157.84">__U__</span>, that's, that's obvious. However, there are instances where we can severely alleviate the amount of RAM that is being used, for certain types of sound. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Luc: </b>And the most obvious is natural, such weather sounds, wind, rain. Those can actually take quite a bit of, of ram, to create a decent sounding environment that's not gonna be completely repetitive. But these are also very easy to do now with very good models, that require very, very little C P U power. And we have <span style="color:red" data-ts="2191.73" data-end_ts="2192.08" title="2191.73" id=c_"2191.73">__tried__</span> to see these as plugins into some of the software used for, for, some for games. But I think that's just the tip of, of the iceberg. And I think even if, and we should be concerned with the issue of C P U usage, we can still, we could still create far more models for convincing sounds than we have if only a little bit more research or efforts was put into it. Right. And of course, we need to keep improving the existing ones, both in terms of performance and, and realism. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Luc: </b>That's another given. There's one more issue that I think it's worth mentioning, which is that there are a lot of programmers who are excellent programmers. There are a lot of excellent audio designers, sound designers, audio engineers. There are few who are able to bridge these two worlds, in my experience. And I think that's, that's also been part of the issue that is, I think that we have a shortage of programmers that have a good understanding and grasp on, on audio right now. And that skillset I think is increasingly valuable in terms of, something that, a student undergrad or grad student can, can actually focus in. Sure. And I very often, even more so now that I, I tend to do a little bit more consulting, I find myself bridging the gap between the audio department and, and the team of programmers that's working on a project in a way, it's almost like somebody has to translate between the two Yeah. And then things can really move forward. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. I think it's interesting because, from one perspective, it seems like that shouldn't be happening anymore. The whole creative coding movement has sort of put a lot of coding resources in the hands of artists and, and sound designers and musicians. And so there's this sense of, hey, we're all coders except the kind of coding that a person who's doing, you know, open frameworks versus the person who's doing, AI development versus the person who's trying to wrap it all together in a big executable, it's a very different kind of programming than somebody who's using processing or C sound or Max to make a little bit of sound producing code. So I think that there's still, there still is kind of a disconnect and, and certainly is a position for someone who can kind of be a translator between those sets of people. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Luc: </b>Absolutely. And and you, you're right in pointing out that there is still more and more people as artists are, are coders, which I think is wonderful, but as we both know, to be a great programmer is a, is a lifelong pursuit in itself. Right. And, and so I think that that's always gonna be the case, however, by being able to, educate both the programmers and the artists a little bit more in each other's work, and by being able to interest programmers more in creative applications and likewise, artists and understanding more some of the technical aspects of their work, I think things become a lot more interesting because in your own work, you've pointed out that at times you felt limited as a sound designer, but by what was available Right. In terms of the technologies that you were working with. Right. And I think that we've all experienced that. And so it sounds to me, based on my experience, that a sound designer who's starting his or her career today will be expected to, to bridge that gap that would be part of becoming a successful sound designer. I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2412.04" data-end_ts="2412.2" title="2412.04" id=c_"2412.04">__said__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, I completely agree. I, I'm curious about how things are gonna diverge, you know, because we certainly see that within the programming communities that, there are massive changes to sort of like the specialization that people get into, where it seems like in a lot of the art stuff, there's getting to be more of a generalization, which is that, you're kind of expected to know a lot about a lot of areas of art. It used to be that, you know, if you were a painter, you'd never picked up a pencil. If you were a sculptor, you would never look at photography. Right. That was the way that art was treated. And and similarly with, with music, if you were a classical musician, you would never look at jazz if you were a jazz player, you would never consider doing anything in electronic music or whatever. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>There were, you know, very much these silos of activity. And it seems like that's being forced to break down. And some of it is because of the desire to have, you know, for artists to develop their own audience and to do so in a way that's kind of populist, but also because the way that artists make, make a living is very different from the way it used to be. It used to be that, you know, you would be an artist and you would either be blessed by an academic institution to become an instructor, or you would be blessed by a patron to be, to be an artist that was subsidized. Right. Absolutely. Now it's like art is a part of art seems to be much more a part of generalized society. We play a game and a game. Gaming is especially an area with massive amounts of art media artwork embedded into it. There's this sense that this is a new area of artwork that represents, you know, I hate to say a career because it's always weird to en mesh the idea of being an artist with the idea of having a career <laugh>. There's something about that that seems like a mismatch, but it does seems to be starting to be the case, which you can imagine there being careers that are artistic at its very nature. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Luc: </b>Yes, absolutely.

<b>Darwin: </b>How do you see that expanding in the future? How is that going to blossom? Or maybe is that gonna, do you think it might contract? Do you think it's it's a real future for arts and particularly students studying art? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Luc: </b>I, I, I do think it's going to continue to, to blossom. I, I, I don't see the trend reverting or even slowing down. Although you're, you're right, it is a novel concept <span style="color:red" data-ts="2587.78" data-end_ts="2588" title="2587.78" id=c_"2587.78">__in__</span> many, in many ways. But because of the applications of the applications for the arts have become so much wider. And I think you're right that gaming is in it itself, responsible for a large portion of that. And because <span style="color:red" data-ts="2601.32" data-end_ts="2601.56" title="2601.32" id=c_"2601.32">__those__</span> technologies are used increasingly, not just for gaming for that matter, but for anything from education to training. And, I, I don't think that we're going to see less of that happening in the future, which is very exciting. It's a great time to be an artist as far as, you know, whether or not this is gonna mean that, you know, we are gonna be turning out hundreds of thousands of artists are gonna easily find employment every year. I, I don't necessarily know that that will be the fact. There will always be composition, there will always be <span style="color:red" data-ts="2635.22" data-end_ts="2635.44" title="2635.22" id=c_"2635.22">__the__</span> inherent challenge of being an artist, which is, you know, finding one's voice. And however, I think it's, it's true, that this has become a new, this is a new trend, which I think is exciting and definitely one that I foresee anyway from, from where I'm, from the places I teach and, and, and the students and clients I work with. I don't see that slowing down right now.

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, right. There you go. So, it's time for us to wrap up. I really appreciate you, spending the time. This has been a really fascinating dive into your world. One question though that I, I would like to have, and I I would, I'm going to start asking this more of people because I think it's a pretty fascinating question. I was asked this in a recent interview and it really, introduced an interesting discussion, which is, if you were to meet an 18 year old version of yourself, what is the advice you would give to that person to help them or have an easier or better path? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Luc: </b>That is a great question. I would probably tell that person or me, as an 18 year old to make sure that the way that you present yourself as an artist is the way that you want to be seen as an artist. I think that there is, a lot of time artists make compromises because we all have to pay <span style="color:red" data-ts="2722.6" data-end_ts="2722.76" title="2722.6" id=c_"2722.6">__their__</span> bills, and that means that it's very easy to get <span style="color:red" data-ts="2726.68" data-end_ts="2726.8" title="2726.68" id=c_"2726.68">__a__</span> diverted in an area which is not one main area of interest and to sort of get pigeonholed. So I think that presenting yourself as the artist that you <span style="color:red" data-ts="2736.52" data-end_ts="2736.76" title="2736.52" id=c_"2736.52">__want__</span> to become and be is maybe the most, or one of the most important things that you can do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Wow. That's, that's an awesome, awesome statement. Thank you for that. And thank you very much for the time. This is really wonderful. And hopefully people can interact with your, some of your work online. But also to know that you are teaching both at Berkeley and N Y U, hopefully students out there looking for a way to, get an interesting twist on their education will be able to look up some of your classes as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Luc: </b>Absolutely. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2773.88" data-end_ts="2774.08" title="2773.88" id=c_"2773.88">__<inaudible>__</span>. And thank you for giving me the, opportunity to talk about ology. 'cause as you can tell, it's an area I feel quite strongly about. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Absolutely. Well, and what I, what I'm hoping is that at some point in the near future, we might be able to talk again and kind of dive even further into it because it is, not only is it an area of, of your interest <span style="color:red" data-ts="2794.74" data-end_ts="2794.96" title="2794.74" id=c_"2794.74">__and__</span> an area for potential growth, but it also really does seem to be, it's gonna just get to be really important. So, but yeah, so thanks a lot for that and we'll talk to you soon. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jean-Luc: </b>Bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Last, the cold still continues. Nevertheless, a fascinating talk with Sean. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2819.76" data-end_ts="2820.04" title="2819.76" id=c_"2819.76">__Luke__</span>, I really appreciate the time that he was willing to take to talk with us. And the whole idea of procedural, sound development is actually pretty exciting. A couple of details. First of all, thanks again for listening and for introducing other people. We got a really nice spike in numbers recently, so I appreciate that. I appreciate all the new listeners. It seems like we've got a bunch of new people that have come online recently, really appreciate that. But mostly I want to ask you to continue to tell friends, family, enemies, everybody that, this exists. Help 'em find it. 'cause the name I kinda goofed up and so it's a little hard to find, but help 'em find the podcast and get a listen to it, get a listen to some of the back episodes. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2864.92" data-end_ts="2865.04" title="2864.92" id=c_"2864.92">__A__</span> lot of fascinating stuff out there. One other detail is next week is my annual, week off for family vacation. And so I will not be doing anything on, June the 21st. We will resume on June the 28th, and I'll see you then. Thanks a.
