<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, today I have the pleasure of introducing you and getting an extended conversation for myself with Victoria Lundy Victoria's a really interesting person. She is the person that I know who is the most accomplished theist, which is, that's an accomplishment of itself because seems like a really hard instrument to play. She's also a performing musician with a group called the In, and she's a solo artist doing like solo ambient work using the thein as primary in instrument. So with that, I, let's say hi to Victoria. Hi, Victoria. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria Lundy: </b>I'm good. How are you? Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thanks a lot for, chatting with me today. It's really appreciated. Let's start off, I just threw out a couple of things that you do, but why don't I have, why don't we start off by having you express how you think of yourself? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>Well, I kind of tumbled into playing the Thein, and I can get into that later, but, I really only started to explore the Thein as a solo instrument a few, couple years ago, really. I'd been playing in some kind of ensemble or or other pretty much since, since I started playing in the nineties. Either a band or some kind of experimental group or something like that. And I, I kind of partially because of, of just, of just, it was sort of time. And because I got involved with, strangely enough the, Rocky Mountain Synth Group, I started realizing I could, you know, that, that I was actually in a position where I could start doing some of my own compositions and working on stuff on my own. So that's kind of where I am right now. And I, what my goal is, I guess, is to try to explore the whole idea of the Thein as an expressive electronic instrument, in a way that maybe other instrument, other electronic instruments haven't traditionally been expressive because of, its just because of the interface, because the way you play it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="139.625" data-end_ts="139.845" title="139.625" id=c_"139.625">__Do__</span> what, what model Thein do you use? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>I have the great luck to have purchased an either way Pro when they started making them. Pretty much right after, actually I bought it <span style="color:red" data-ts="152.665" data-end_ts="152.885" title="152.665" id=c_"152.665">__at__</span>, I purchased it at the factory, because I was at a Thein, a <span style="color:red" data-ts="157.685" data-end_ts="158.085" title="157.685" id=c_"157.685">__Thorman__</span> event in Asheville at Mogue. And, they were kind of the head of, they, they, they gave us a deal, <laugh>, and, yeah, it was really a, I don't think I, I don't know that I would've, I probably would've tried to buy one, but that was really amazing. It was an amazing coincidence that I, that, and then they didn't, they only made, I don't know how many they made, but they didn't, they didn't, they weren't in production for very long. Right. And then they, they stopped making them. I think I have number 300. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, that's amazing. That's astounding. Yeah. What a great opportunity. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>Yeah. So, that was my, that was my great luck. I, and that is my <span style="color:red" data-ts="191.245" data-end_ts="191.445" title="191.245" id=c_"191.245">__gig__</span> instrument. I, I still have my original black big Briar Thein that I bought in the nineties from, the Bob Mo, Bob Moog's company then, which was Big Breyer. Right. Which is a lovely instrument. It actually is quite good. And I also have a Wavefront Classic Thein, which is in a, in a, a cabinet. It's a really beautiful instrument. But it's not very practical or taking Yeah, it's taking 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Anywhere. It's, that's one of those that like, it's, it's the really fancy wood cabinets. Right. You 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>Got the legs and, yeah. I mean, right. And it's just like, yeah, I've taken it a couple of, a couple of situations, but it's not, it's not very good for that. And it's a little bit, it's a little, it's a little spooky, but this one just pops apart and goes in a bag. It's, it's really absolutely designed for, for traveling and, and taking somewhere. And it has beautiful linearity and a great tone. It's a fantastic instrument. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. So, what instrument were you, what instrument did you play prior to the Thermin? Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>You know, I'm not a, I am not a, a huge musician before the Theorem, <span style="color:red" data-ts="254.965" data-end_ts="255.085" title="254.965" id=c_"254.965">__and__</span> I played some guitar. I did like what a lot of people did. I played some guitar. I played a little bit of piano. I was not a really seriously trained musician. And I just sort of fell into the thein. I had a lot of, I have a very musical background when it comes to my family. My mother was a singer, and she was a classical, a classical, you know, opera trained singer. So I was around a lot of music from the beginning, and I <span style="color:red" data-ts="281.685" data-end_ts="281.725" title="281.685" id=c_"281.685">__have__</span> a lot of familiarity with it. And I, you know, I took piano lessons when I was a kid and et cetera, but I'd never really found anything or fell into the performance aspect in my life until I found the Thein. I really, I'm trained as a visual artist. I mean, that's kind of where I came from. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>And the reason that I, even really found out about the Thein as an instrument other than this, just this peculiar thing I'd heard, which I, I really fond of, but didn't know how it was played, was because I was working as a volunteer at the Bug Theater back in the nineties. And, Jeff Cleveland, who's a tremendous jazz musician in town, came through with the emergency broadcast players, and he had a thein, and he played that in the emergency broadcast players. I'd never seen one, I had no idea what the interface was. I'd always kind of imagined it with some kind of keyboard, and I was hooked. I just had to have one <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's interesting. That's, that's cool. Now, I'm curious, you say that you had a, a very musical family, a lot of musical influence when you grew up. Now, one of the things I would say is in talking with people, people who have parents who were musicians, who were serious musicians, either are sort of like pushed into becoming musicians themselves or are like actively dissuaded from being musicians, because it's kind of a hard way to do your thing. You know, I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>Was probably, I was probably in the second category a little bit. I mean, it was sort of like, it wasn't exactly, I wasn't exactly dissuaded, but I was like, it was pretty intimidated, maybe, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>Yeah. Yeah. I think, I think we all were a bit, I mean, all of, a lot of us are dabbler. I don't think any of us are, were were real. You know, my brother played a band, Uhhuh <affirmative> brother played occasionally and got into music, and he was actually DJ for a while. And, but, you know, I wasn't really performing. I never really performed except for like once when I was in my twenties until like the nineties. Interesting. And that was with the Thein, and that was just in a really, you know, strange forgiving situation. I ended up playing with <span style="color:red" data-ts="408.085" data-end_ts="408.205" title="408.085" id=c_"408.085">__a__</span>, an experimental group and, you know, I was the kid with the bat. I had a Thein <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>I mean, that was really what it was. I mean, that's how I got started. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You saw Jeff Cleveland, playing, playing the Thein, and you were like that. Did you say that looks like a fun instrument to play it? Or did you say that sounds like an instrument I would like to play it, or? Well, it, it was 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>Kind of a <span style="color:red" data-ts="432.845" data-end_ts="432.885" title="432.845" id=c_"432.845">__little__</span> both. It was, it was partially what it was was that I had, I was a fan of the Thein uhhuh before I ever saw one. Okay. And from just, from just the, the point of view of like somebody who was really into like b movies for the fifties. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Okay. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>Alright. Completely. So I knew what it was, I knew what it sounded like, but I had no idea how it was played. Ah, so it was a whole, like, it opened a complete, I had no idea that's how you played a thein. I had never actually seen somebody play one Right. Anywhere. I don't know how I managed not to do that, but I, I had never actually seen one played until then. And it was a real revelation that there, there was this really freaky interface to make these sounds. I'd always kind of, I think I kind of in my head pictured something like a own <span style="color:red" data-ts="477.565" data-end_ts="477.845" title="477.565" id=c_"477.565">__Martin__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="477.965" data-end_ts="478.085" title="477.965" id=c_"477.965">__o__</span> or a, a Nova chord or something. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Something that would have some, that would be like a regular instrument, but with some Right, right. Some tool to facilitate the slid <span style="color:red" data-ts="487.485" data-end_ts="487.725" title="487.485" id=c_"487.485">__this__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>Right. Right. Right. Exactly. So, so that was just fascinating. I thought, well, I've gotta, I've gotta try this. This seems like something that I could do because I've, I always, I always had pretty good pitch Uhhuh 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>So I felt like that was maybe something that would help. And, and like a lot of instruments, and I, I have, I happen <span style="color:red" data-ts="505.845" data-end_ts="505.965" title="505.845" id=c_"505.845">__to__</span> think I'm kind of a slow learner, but you <span style="color:red" data-ts="508.605" data-end_ts="508.885" title="508.605" id=c_"508.605">__spend__</span> a lot of time really being really bad on the thein before you can really get a grip on it, sort of like playing the violin or something. Right. It's just 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Really, that's, yeah. That's when you said that it was the immediate thing that came to mind. Violin sounds horrible right up until the moment it starts sounding good. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>Exactly. Yeah. It's a lot like that. I mean, you can kind of, there's, there's a lot of thes on eBay Yeah. <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Because 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>It just, you know, you know, eventually people just get, get tired of trying, I think. Right. And before they make that breakthrough, and Sure. Some people make it faster. I mean, there, you know, that being said, that I'm not, like, I don't have a huge musical background. There are people now who are playing, who are spectacular musicians. I mean, there always have been a few, but it, it kind of exploded in the last 10 or so years. I think a lot more classically trained musicians, people who were playing, you know, instruments in <span style="color:red" data-ts="561.645" data-end_ts="561.725" title="561.645" id=c_"561.645">__our__</span> orchestra who decided to take up the Thein. Right. And their, you know, their learning curve is much faster. Of course. And they're, you know, they're touring and doing, you know, formal setting, classical and other types of concerts that I, you know, that were really up, you know, something you almost never saw before. Right. Except with a few people like Lydia Kavanaugh, Uhhuh <affirmative>, who was like, you know, but, but yeah, they're, they're out there and they're, they're doing, I mean, they're just everywhere now. I mean, to me, I'm sure it's a pretty small group of people, but it's, it's amazing who's out there playing, playing the theorem <span style="color:red" data-ts="596.285" data-end_ts="596.405" title="596.285" id=c_"596.285">__and__</span> as a legitimate instrument, not as a novelty. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. Not as, you know, not as a version of the musical saw. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>And, you know, putting out new music, putting out recordings of, of compositions from the first wave of the Thein, you know, during the thirties and forties that people, you know, there were some people who were composing for the Thein at that time and those things, you know, they were played by Clara Rockmore and then you never heard them again, and now people were resurrecting them. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>There were people that became entranced by her and her particular style, and I think we're writing specifically for that. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>Right. I think so. Yeah. And, you know, some of them were just writing for this, you know, oh, this weird electronic instrument, I think 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>But you know, that, oh, here's this new thing we can, you know, but I think a lot of it was, it was kind of, it was kind of bracketed by what they heard her abilities and her sound. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>I think that might've influenced them. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So when you decided to, or when you started doing this, you, how did you get from a person who bought a <span style="color:red" data-ts="663.765" data-end_ts="664.055" title="663.765" id=c_"663.765">__fair__</span>, because it was, because you saw one played and you loved the sound from b movies into being part of an experiment, being the theist for an experimental band that seems like showed pretty big leap showed <laugh>. Yeah. It's like, well, I mean, it wasn't like friends and they were like, oh, you play something weird, come <span style="color:red" data-ts="683.455" data-end_ts="683.615" title="683.455" id=c_"683.455">__on__</span> and play. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>I, you know, it, you know, it showing up is 90% of everything. I think that, <span style="color:red" data-ts="689.175" data-end_ts="689.295" title="689.175" id=c_"689.175">__I__</span> guess, I, I, I really was kinda like that. I was, at the time, I was, like I said, a pretty involved volunteer at the Bug Theater. And it was just completely, I mean, it was a much more out there experimental place than it it's now. It was, we were, it was really, you know, performance art really out there. And there was a group that had formed, that was kind of a loose association called the Carbon Dioxide Orchestra that always featured somebody playing a big piece of metal with a big piece of dry ice. Right. And, you know, putting it through effects. And it was just really whack. And it was, it was actually almost a tradition <laugh> at that point. But, I was just kind of getting slightly comfortable in the instrument and was like, oh, you should, you should play a session with us. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>I mean, <laugh>, that was, yeah, that was kind of how that happened. It, it really was sort of the kid with the bat thing, you know? Wow. There just wasn't a lot out there. And I was really determined to, to, to try really hard and, and play it. And it was a very, it was sort of a, almost like a conduction group where Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> where there was very little, it's mostly express, you know, listening and, and in the moment type composition. Right. Based on whatever was happening. So it was great ear training. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. No training. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>And challenging, but not, not scary <laugh> in a way, because, you know, it was just so freeform that I could just kinda get comfortable. And I <span style="color:red" data-ts="776.805" data-end_ts="776.885" title="776.805" id=c_"776.805">__got__</span>, I got got comfortable pretty fast. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. It was kind of wide open. So that gave you a lot of space, huh? Right. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>Yeah. Exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That makes a lot of sense. So now, when you started doing it again, especially, so, so when was it that you started being kind of serious about playing? What, what kind of timeframe? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>Yeah, I fooled around a little bit. I was, while I was doing that, I was trying to get control of the instrument Mm-Hmm. As an instrument. And so I just started, you know, I, I went through the, there is a, there was at the time a very small book on how to play. It was written, I think by, I think it might <span style="color:red" data-ts="815.045" data-end_ts="815.165" title="815.045" id=c_"815.045">__have__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="815.165" data-end_ts="815.205" title="815.165" id=c_"815.165">__been__</span> written by Clat Rockmore. There were a couple of videos on how to play that. I think Lydia <span style="color:red" data-ts="819.455" data-end_ts="819.805" title="819.455" id=c_"819.455">__Caugh__</span> had made for, for <span style="color:red" data-ts="820.885" data-end_ts="821.085" title="820.885" id=c_"820.885">__Oak__</span>. So I went about just training myself. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, and started getting some control over it and playing, trying to play linearly. Right. And, you know, mostly there wasn't really the internet, thank God. I mean, <span style="color:red" data-ts="838.365" data-end_ts="838.565" title="838.365" id=c_"838.365">__the__</span> internet has made it so much easier. There was nobody teaching, there was nobody showing you how to do this, so you had to kind of work it out on your own. And, I started to get a grip on how to control it. It took me a while because I, I was kind of a slow learner. But within, you know, I, I think I started playing like 96. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>And within a couple of years, I'd gotten so I could at least, I could at least sketch a tune, you know? I wasn't as, you know, I wasn't great, but I could do it. So, and I got, I got, you know, I just kept working on it. I mean, I don't really have a, a solution for how I did it. I just sort of worked at it. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So like, who, who would've been influences? Because at that time there wouldn't, other than like these <span style="color:red" data-ts="883.725" data-end_ts="884.285" title="883.725" id=c_"883.725">__classist__</span> classicists Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>There didn't seem to be a lot of people using it as a, as an adventurous instrument. Right, <span style="color:red" data-ts="897.055" data-end_ts="897.405" title="897.055" id=c_"897.055">__right__</span>. And so did you, did you find yourself taking influences from other musicians? Or was it taking influences from the people you played with and just finding a way to fit in? How did you, how did you like, mold your, your sound or your voice on the instrument? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>Well, there's a couple of things. One of it was somebody who was pretty influential early on. 'cause she was, you know, besides Lydia <span style="color:red" data-ts="920.645" data-end_ts="920.845" title="920.645" id=c_"920.645">__Cabinet__</span>, who was sort of the classical theorist at the time, you know, and she still is. She's the, I think grand niece of Thein. He taught her how to play. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, she's kind of right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>She's kind of, there was Pamela Kirsten, who I know she's been remarried and I know she has a new surname, but I can't remember what it is right now, who was also a, who is and was, a, a theist from that period who was extraordinary and had a completely different sound than I could ever have. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> it. She just, her, her at everybody's approach is so transparent. You can, you can hear them like in a couple of notes. You can almost tell who's playing. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. I <span style="color:red" data-ts="963.645" data-end_ts="963.725" title="963.645" id=c_"963.645">__can__</span> almost 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>Like a guitarist or something, because it's just such a transparent interface. So she has this delicate touch. I've never had Uhhuh. And, you know, Pam, and, and so there were a couple of people who were actual theists at the time, who I was trying to emulate, but I really took my cue from vocal music. Oh, sure. Classical vocal music. And there's <span style="color:red" data-ts="987.645" data-end_ts="987.725" title="987.645" id=c_"987.645">__a__</span>, you know, my mother was a singer. Right. I had heard, a spinto soprano who sang a lot of Puccini for most of my life. And I had learned, learned those scores. And that was where I went. I went to that. Interesting. And that's what I tried to learn. That's where I, you know, those were the things that I used as my benchmarks. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Wow. Well that's, that's pretty, that's pretty serious. That's, that's, that's jumping into the deep water a little bit. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>It really was. But I, I kind of felt I understood that music in this kind of visceral way that I think that I, that that you, you know, that you do when you're exposed to it all the time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, that makes sense. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>And I knew it 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. So what are, what are the things that you hear then that you hear yourself doing that you don't hear other theorists doing in their work? You know, 'cause I would say it's, it's interesting you said that because, I got a chance to see you when you performed at the older Dairy Center for the Arts. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And it was extraordinary, first of all, but also the, the tone. And, you know, I had for some reason when I, when I went back to school, I kind of found myself getting a little bit pummeled with Clara Rockmore stuff. Right. Uhhuh <affirmative>. It was <span style="color:red" data-ts="1068.685" data-end_ts="1068.845" title="1068.685" id=c_"1068.685">__kinda__</span> interesting. There was like this guy who was teaching, who was really into it, into Thein and particularly into her, work on the Thein. And so I got a lot of it, got to hear a lot of it, and I always found it to be like very, like hyper romantic and very violy. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And in your 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>Case, which makes some sense, because that was her instrument. Oh, she was a violinist before 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>She, I didn't theist. Okay. Yeah. Well, that would make sense. But when you said that you got your influence from vocal music that immediately clipped because you stuff your playing doesn't remind me of a violin. It reminds me of a singer. Oh, okay. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1111.295" data-end_ts="1111.415" title="1111.295" id=c_"1111.295">__And__</span> so it's very interesting that that was your influence. Now, what, what do you think are the details that make that come out? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>I think the thing is that, see the Thein is this interesting thing in that it doesn't, well, you know, it has a lot of things that are like, well, that are like vocal music and are not like vocal music. But part of it is, I think that the thing that is, is unique about the thein, or at least kind of like, makes it more of an electronic instrument, is that you could play a note for 30 minutes without taking a breath if you wanted to. Right, right. And just holding your hands in position and just standing there. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> you groan for the rest of your life. But I, I've always thought of the phrasing of, of music, especially if, if for instance, I am trying to play an aria, which I do a lot, on my own, especially, it's all about breath. Right. I, I think <span style="color:red" data-ts="1165.895" data-end_ts="1166.015" title="1165.895" id=c_"1165.895">__a__</span> phrasing is breath. And I think the one thing that I, I do, if I bring anything unique to it, is that I tend to phrase like a singer. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>And I tend to use the idea of 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>In my phrasing, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1182.415" data-end_ts="1182.535" title="1182.415" id=c_"1182.415">__I__</span> not always, I sometimes I consciously don't do that when I'm doing certain things. But I, I think I think about it that way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Do you find yourself like singing along with yourself as you play or you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>Have to <span style="color:red" data-ts="1196.315" data-end_ts="1196.535" title="1196.315" id=c_"1196.315">__sub__</span> vocalize the play <laugh>. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>You kind of do. Yeah. I mean, I, I hear people who can actually do this. And I think Peter Pringle's, one of 'em, or a couple people I've heard do this, who can actually sing and play with her at the same time. I do not know how they do that. Oh, that seems <span style="color:red" data-ts="1210.735" data-end_ts="1211.055" title="1210.735" id=c_"1210.735">__right__</span>. Yeah. I have never really been able to do that. I can do a little bit, like I can hold a note and I can sing a phrase over it, but I can't do what I've heard people because I am sub vocalizing those damn notes Right. To myself all the time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Interesting. Yeah. So, the, let's talk a little bit about the instrument itself, because you <span style="color:red" data-ts="1231.335" data-end_ts="1231.535" title="1231.335" id=c_"1231.335">__meant__</span>, you mentioned something before about, one of the instruments that you have having like a peculiarly good linearity and stuff like that. For people who aren't familiar with the thein, there's like an antenna to one side in a fertile antenna. And I mean, this is gonna sound ridiculous because I'm, I'm gonna <laugh>, it's gonna sound like I'm making a joke, but you play it by waving your arms around, which is sort of a 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>Yeah, that's right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But it's, I think it's at the heart of why it ends up really quickly either be being like disappointing or incredibly personal because the way that you move is gonna have a direct correlation with the instrument now. Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1276.415" data-end_ts="1276.635" title="1276.415" id=c_"1276.415">__Or__</span> with the sound that you make. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Now my question is, what are some of the differences between instruments and what would make an instrument preferable, one instrument preferable over another to you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>Well, the most, there are a couple of things that are just paramount. And one of 'em is just kind of, its inherent tone, which I know you can manipulate with effects and, you know, things you put in this, in the chain after the tone that comes outta the actual instrument. Right. But, I say my gating thurman's my favorite Thurman for a couple reasons. There's, it's got a beautiful kind of basic tone. And you can manipulate that by adding more of a saw wave or less of one or more of a just a sign wave style. You know, it has a couple of presets Okay. To give it a more rough or a less, you know, a smoother kind of sound or more of a flute sound. More of a, a rougher or a rougher sound. Sure. So I think the inherent tone is <span style="color:red" data-ts="1332.285" data-end_ts="1332.445" title="1332.285" id=c_"1332.285">__in__</span>, is important. The cabinet there I have, has a beautiful inherent tone that's very much like a cello. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>It's really, you know, it kind of, it's sort of funny that it looks like a, it looks like a grand piano <laugh> in terms of a theorem sounds. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1350.245" data-end_ts="1350.405" title="1350.245" id=c_"1350.245">__And__</span> it sort of sounds like one, you know, it sounds like this, right. It has a beautiful, beautiful inherent tone. But the thing that is, to me, the most important thing, 'cause you can kind of manipulate that with, post effects, right. Is linearity. And that is the scale between the lowest node and the highest node on the, on the thein, which is going to be controlled by your right hand antenna, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1373.285" data-end_ts="1373.565" title="1373.285" id=c_"1373.285">__that__</span> the upright antenna Okay. Is sort of a logarithmic relationship. As you get closer to that antenna, the, the notes are gonna get closer together as they get higher, they're gonna get closer together. As they're lower, they're going to get a little farther apart. So it's almost a logarithmic kind of thing. And the best <span style="color:red" data-ts="1391.645" data-end_ts="1392.125" title="1391.645" id=c_"1391.645">__therein__</span> smooth that out and make the, the linearity is better. It's more of a, you know, like just a straight scale. It is never an exactly straight scale. It's always gonna be smaller. The higher notes are gonna be a little smaller Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1407.305" data-end_ts="1407.525" title="1407.305" id=c_"1407.305">__Or__</span> closer together. And the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1408.565" data-end_ts="1408.725" title="1408.565" id=c_"1408.565">__lower__</span>, but the better the linearity, the more playable the instrument's going to be. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1412.795" data-end_ts="1413.085" title="1412.795" id=c_"1412.795">__Well__</span>, that would make sense, because you just get used to jumps in distance representing notes. And if that's constantly changing, that has to be a little disconcerting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>Right. And even if, you know, and there's gonna also be a limit <span style="color:red" data-ts="1426.185" data-end_ts="1426.405" title="1426.185" id=c_"1426.185">__to__</span> your high notes if they're too close together. Right, right. Too far apart. You're gonna have harder times doing, I mean, there's gonna be some physical, physical limitations Right. At some point with, so I find that the linearity is, is something to, and it takes a little while to kind of get, get a feel for that linearity when <span style="color:red" data-ts="1442.845" data-end_ts="1442.965" title="1442.845" id=c_"1442.845">__you__</span>, but I've gotten, so I can like walk up to an instrument and kind of tune it up and kind of get a feel for where those octaves are. Right. Very quickly. And kind of see if it's gonna be <span style="color:red" data-ts="1453.085" data-end_ts="1453.205" title="1453.085" id=c_"1453.085">__a__</span>, how playable it is. But that's, that's, I think that's the most important thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. Now, does, does, your environment have much to do with how the instrument responds? I, and I ask this because, hey, first of all, we are up in the Rockies, and so we have this really dry, arid, but constantly changing, weather, weather environment. Right. And I know for, like in synth world, the playability of certain kinds of touch based, instrument interfaces become really difficult <span style="color:red" data-ts="1490.745" data-end_ts="1490.965" title="1490.745" id=c_"1490.745">__in__</span> really dry weather. And as, and also as guitarists, I know guitars respond really differently and really weirdly to some of the weather that we have here. What do you ever see that, I mean, because it's a no touch device, but also because it's really weird electronics Mm-Hmm. I'm wondering if it has, if there's any, if <span style="color:red" data-ts="1512.325" data-end_ts="1512.525" title="1512.325" id=c_"1512.325">__the__</span> this kind of environment has any effect on it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>Part of it, I have to say, there are so many other things that are affecting you before you even get to that point, <laugh>. Okay. That you kind of, I don't even, that's almost becomes negligible. I see. It's sort of Okay. You have to realize a lot of the, I have played the thein and crowded bars full of drunk people. Right. Okay. So, what you're 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>A <span style="color:red" data-ts="1538.205" data-end_ts="1538.485" title="1538.205" id=c_"1538.205">__possibly__</span> doing <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>Oh, it's, that's huge. You're constantly trying to figure out how you can isolate yourself physically Right. From the rest of the room and from anything that's moving, first of all, I mean, it's kind of the lowest level defense is trying to keep, especially your pitch antenna, because the pitch antenna is affected by not just you, it just, it's affected by whatever's closest to the pitch antenna. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And how far, how far does that, how far does that reach out? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>It can reach out depending on how you have it tuned. It can reach out for like six feet. Oh my goodness. It, yeah. It could be really, really devastating. And, I tune them pretty tightly, you know, and there's a limit to how, how much you can do. And I've been on a tiny stage and tuned my theorem very tightly and been, it is been a little, little dicey. But, you know, the, the, the real you're, you're getting affected by that. You're getting affected by stationary objects too, because you have to kind of like, you know, you have a big amp to your left or to your right. You're going to have to tune to that. Right. And it's not gonna move. So once you've got that set up, you're okay. And then, you know, you don't, you wanna be to the, for me, I wanna be to the right of everybody on the stage because I want my pitching antenna as far away from swinging head stocks and drummers and stuff. Drummers as 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Possible. Drummers, yeah. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>Yeah. So, you know, because that all having a guy back into you is gonna just totally destroy what you're playing 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. So I, I hadn't even really thought about that, but Yeah. Yeah. All of a sudden, the 300 pound drunken <span style="color:red" data-ts="1635.045" data-end_ts="1635.285" title="1635.045" id=c_"1635.045">__loud__</span> representing the, most musical thing near the stage is a little scary. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>Yeah. Bit, <laugh>. So, so, so yeah. It's sort of like, how do you, how so, it, it sort of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1646.925" data-end_ts="1647.045" title="1646.925" id=c_"1646.925">__is__</span> kind of a damage control thing and Right. And when you're really lucky and you're on a big enough stage, you're way over away from everybody and everything is lovely. And, that that's great. But yeah, it's sort of like the other, the other aspects of how does the, the weather or the, you know, ambient humidity, <laugh>, it's like voice. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1664.125" data-end_ts="1664.245" title="1664.125" id=c_"1664.125">__Yeah__</span>. It becomes, it becomes, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That was all you had to worry about. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>Exactly. I, I have had a problem where I played outside and it got hot and I, my pitch kept, I had to keep adjusting my pitch between songs. Oh, interesting. Sure. 'cause I think the electronics were getting really warm <laugh>. Right. Say, okay, I'm at the edge. I gotta stop. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1682.105" data-end_ts="1682.325" title="1682.105" id=c_"1682.105">__You__</span> gotta stop. Cool off. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. So, let's, let's talk then a little bit about playing in a band. 'cause that's, that actually sounds, I, I hadn't even really thought about how difficult that must be. But also, where do you find the thein slotting into kind of a band environment? Is it like, I mean, what would be an analog instrument wise? I mean, is it like being the saxophonist or the harmonica player where, you know, everyone plays <span style="color:red" data-ts="1712.065" data-end_ts="1712.285" title="1712.065" id=c_"1712.065">__and__</span> they look at you and it's like solo time? Or is there a way for you to play like backing, you know, useful? I don't, I don't understand how it would fit in a band, because I think that it primarily is a soloing instrument. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>Right. And one of the things that I've been doing since the beginning, and I've actually made a point of, is I really want to play as an ensemble instrument. I've tried to back, I mean, I've done solo work recently, but I've spent most of my time playing in ensembles, Uhhuh, <affirmative>, because I think that the bin's a really cool instrument to have an ensemble. And, it fills a lot of the sonic space of a synthesizer, which you could imagine, right. Of a keyboard. But, you know, it's a monophonic instrument essentially. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, it's one node, so it doesn't have the attack of a horn. So, it doesn't really, it's, it's kind of its own thing, but I feel like it's sort of, I feel like it fills the space of a string instrument, like a cello. Oh, sure. Right. Or a violin, or a vocalist, or as I said, it's kind of a synthesizer, but sort of of like a monophonic synth. Right. That doesn't have any real attack, you know? Yeah. Yeah. So, that's kind of what I've always done, and I've always just found a spot. Well, I was lucky enough to hook up with a bunch of guys who, you know, heard the thein, heard that I played the Thein and said, yes, we must have this on every song, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>Cool. And I'm not gonna vouch for whether that was a good decision or not. But there it's, and you know, that was the in activist, and I've been playing with them. You know, we've made six or seven CDs and it just never ends. Right, right. <laugh> we've been playing together since like late 2003, so Yeah. But yeah, I mean, there are solo moments, but a lot of it is just sort of these sweeps and whooshes that you would hear, or these melody lines that you would hear a synth play. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Okay. That makes sense. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>And I've always liked the idea of it as an ensemble instrument, because I think <span style="color:red" data-ts="1839.285" data-end_ts="1839.445" title="1839.285" id=c_"1839.285">__it__</span> does, it does kind of like, oh, look, we're gonna <span style="color:red" data-ts="1841.165" data-end_ts="1841.365" title="1841.165" id=c_"1841.165">__try__</span> out the thein. Wasn't that interesting? Okay, now we're done. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, it's, you know, I, I was hoping that you were, you know, we could talk about it that way because, you know, I always think of like, harmonica players, very few harmonica players know how to vamp or know how to sit in an ensemble setting. Most times they're, yeah. They're soloing a hundred percent of the time, which is kind of a tough sled. And I was wondering if that was sort of the expectation of what a theorist would bring to <span style="color:red" data-ts="1868.885" data-end_ts="1869.005" title="1868.885" id=c_"1868.885">__the__</span> theorist would bring to the table. And it's good to hear that you're finding a different place for it. That's neat. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>I, I've always done that. I've always, and you know, every time I, I always try to, I love to play <span style="color:red" data-ts="1879.205" data-end_ts="1879.325" title="1879.205" id=c_"1879.205">__an__</span> ensemble. I like to play as a, I sometimes I play as a drone instrument. Sometimes I play as a, you know, I play a melodic line, but I kind of think of it as the spot that maybe a background singer with a, a backup backups there would have. Or maybe <span style="color:red" data-ts="1895.325" data-end_ts="1895.445" title="1895.325" id=c_"1895.325">__a__</span>, a keyboard player or maybe a, a violinist or a a a cellist or something. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Yeah. That's cool. Now, speaking of ensembles, one of the things you've been doing recently is working with one of these conduction ensembles, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>Yep. Yeah. The, Fluxx Conduction fluxx crew con, conduction ensemble. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>How, how is that, that's, that seems like hard work to me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>It is hard work. There are some electronic, like guitar, electronic electric guitars, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1930.125" data-end_ts="1930.245" title="1930.125" id=c_"1930.125">__a__</span> keyboard and me, I think that's all the electronic instruments. And then the rest of it is, the rest of ensemble is classical or acoustic instruments. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>Double bass, cello, stringed instrument from Vietnam, which I can't remember the name of right now. And, some, some woodwind, lots of woodwinds, some different, different, some different, you know, some horns. So, so it's, and a drummer. So it's a, it's a pretty eclectic group. And I've worked really hard to find different sounds to kind of get past the limitations of the thermin. Right. And come up with different kinds of, of sounds I can do on command based on the conductor. That will, where I can come up with a percussive tone, I can come up with some harmonics and I have to be able to do this pretty quickly. So I've had to come up with different little, you know, pedal effects or whatever, and things that I could do on the spur of a moment Sure. And be able to, to, to, to deliver immediately. Right. And that's been a real challenge. It's been hard work, but I think we are gonna finally play in, in public. So <laugh>. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>It's gonna be interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Who's, who's leading this group? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>Oh yeah. Dean Odean, oh, he's, he, he's leading the group and he's using Butch Morris's method of conduction. Right. He worked with Butch for years. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, he's actually teaching a workshop, on, on sound conduction at, the King Center, at the Media Music Festival during the day, of the, it's the 29th of April during the day. And then at night we're going to have a concert Interesting. Using Conduction, the Conduction group. So it's our, it's our, it's not quite our public debut. We've had a few people listen in, but we haven't actually played in this setting before. So. Nice. It's gonna be interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Well, good luck. That sounds, that sounds like an incredible, it 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>Is challenging. It is. Like, by, by the time you leave a a session, you're just wiped out. Oh yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2064.485" data-end_ts="2064.525" title="2064.485" id=c_"2064.485">__very__</span>, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2064.725" data-end_ts="2064.845" title="2064.725" id=c_"2064.725">__gotcha__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>You concentrate so hard for so long. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, everyone I've talked to that's been involved in conduction, groups talks about like the level of commitment it takes to really, to really succeed because you end up having to spend a lot of time developing techniques that you can pull up at the drop of a hat. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>Exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And so as a result, you really need to be on top of your game. And the, the level of concentration is extraordinary, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>I think. Yeah, that's exactly right. It took me a few tries to get a, a suite of, of, of effects and et cetera that would work in this setting. Right. And it's sort of funny 'cause I went back to my most basic analog stuff. Instead of doing anything, it's very, you know, I'm using, an old digital effects processor and some moger foggers 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>For my post effects. I mean, you know, so it's like really not doing anything with anything, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2127.545" data-end_ts="2127.745" title="2127.545" id=c_"2127.545">__and__</span> it just, it's all just, you know, kick it on. You're there, you're, you know, got your effect. And it's really straightforward. So now 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Have, have you ever experimented with, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2138.685" data-end_ts="2139.165" title="2138.685" id=c_"2138.685">__Thurman__</span> driving MIDI devices at all? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>Yeah, I have. I've actually used it to drive, some, midi effects on Ableton. And I've also used it to, strangely enough to drive, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2157.845" data-end_ts="2158.045" title="2157.845" id=c_"2157.845">__use__</span> control voltage 'cause I have control voltage out in, pitch and volume Okay.

A really nice, I mean, you can get some fantastic sounds out of that, and it really opens up the palette. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, I was gonna say, that's a very, that's a much broader range of tools than you're gonna have as the direct output of the thein. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>Yeah. It's, you know, again, with the vocal music, it's a, it's one note, it's a monophonic instrument in its heart. Right. And I've also done some things with digital effects where I've used it to drive, native instruments, reactor uhhuh, which has been a really, a really cool, opening up of, of things for doing sort of a, a solo set or something where I'm doing sort of an ambient set Sure. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2215.485" data-end_ts="2215.605" title="2215.485" id=c_"2215.485">__And__</span> kind of adding all these colors that are happening kind of spontaneously being driven by the sound of the thein 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Now, recently, recently, you put out a solo album, it's called Miss America Vampire, I think, right? Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>This American Vampire. Yes. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Why don't, what was that like, how did you, how did you build a solo album? Did you use a lot of other instrumentation or was it just using the, the thein, or was it, or did you have other artists working with you? What, what was the process of making that 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>It was difficult. I, I haven't really done that before, so I think I made a lot of elementary mistakes. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2256.035" data-end_ts="2256.325" title="2256.035" id=c_"2256.035">__Okay__</span>. But, what I, what I think I did well, I guess what I would say is I, I went ahead and kind of stuck to the whole digital realm and did things using, I said I mostly used Ableton to build stuff using MIDI devices, for as sort of, you know, for, for the things that I didn't think the Thein would do. Right. Like, you know, percussive things. And, but then I got a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2282.965" data-end_ts="2283.045" title="2282.965" id=c_"2282.965">__little__</span> deeper <span style="color:red" data-ts="2283.265" data-end_ts="2283.485" title="2283.265" id=c_"2283.265">__to__</span> that and started sampling thein Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and made instruments out of them. Right. So I kind of, I kind of cheated in terms of the thein. I tried to bring the thein in to do things that it didn't typically do, and then used it as its lead instrument essentially. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That explains it though, because when I listened to it, when I listened to some of the tracks <span style="color:red" data-ts="2300.925" data-end_ts="2301.005" title="2300.925" id=c_"2300.925">__of__</span> it, there were clearly things that tonally sounded like a thein, but didn't play like a thein. Right. And so that's why I was like, I was a little bit confused about what, you know, what was going on there. And now that makes sense. Mm-Hmm. If you use Thermin as a source for a sampling instrument that would give you that essence of thein while still allowing you some different playing functions. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>Exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>And I wanna go back and do more of that, because I thought it was, that was the most successful thing I felt. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Well, it was a, I thought it was a really successful, piece of work. I really enjoyed the sound of it. And again, it was, it, to me, it very much had a unique voice, which I think is cool because I think that the Thurman is an instrument because of how you play it, it sort of forces you to develop your own voice anyway, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>I think. Absolutely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. But somehow in that thing you encapsulated, you encapsulated your voice in the release, and I thought it was really successful. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>Thank you. I appreciate that. Sure. I wanna do more. I, I, I have to decide, I have to decide which way to go. I'm, I've been thinking about that really hard for a couple of months, <laugh> about what, what to do next. And I did. I think that was one of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2378.995" data-end_ts="2379.195" title="2378.995" id=c_"2378.995">__my__</span>, I think just finding the idea of, of taking the thein and making it into other things was pretty successful, but I always liked the, the, the pure voice of it right. In, in the mix. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Certainly. So before we go, one of the things I want to do is, is maybe help those people that, bio a thein and are already thinking about putting it on eBay, <laugh> <laugh> in, in that I would, I'm wondering how, what you think would be ways that people could, kind of rapidly approach the instrument that has a high level likelihood of success. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>I think, well, and this was my approach that's, I'm very biased. I thought thinking of it as a vocal instrument we're really well and trying to learn it. And that's just because it's, the way you play it is kind of inherently like singing in that you don't have it, it's monophonic and you're doing it by just moving. But it's not, it, it doesn't have any kind of fretboard or anything. There's no, there's no, point of reference for you. So I think the first thing I would do if I was going to start from scratch was I would first learn as carefully as I could, given the documentation you <span style="color:red" data-ts="2459.955" data-end_ts="2460.075" title="2459.955" id=c_"2459.955">__give__</span> the thing, how to tune it and where to sit, and I would sit down. That's the first thing I would do, <laugh>, because that helps you. It really helps. It's ridiculous how much it helps. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>And I would concentrate it, it's a very zen experience I would concentrate on, on being still and learning how to go from stillness to movement with the thermin in terms of thinking about that, that antenna as your, the, the, the distance between your shoulder and that, that, that antenna as your pitch. That's extremely important. But the thing that I think that people neglect when they're playing the thermin and when they're learning is the left hand, which is your volume, right. That the, that's your articulation. And it's the most, it's very important. It's so important. And you don't start realizing how important it is until later. But if you kind of come in with that idea that, you know, you're making notes with your right hand, but you're, I mean, you're making tones of your right hand, but you're making notes with your left hand, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>And that's how you articulate those notes. And that's, that's as important and maybe almost more important than the other hand. And I think that it's neglected when people are trying to learn, but I think it's, it, I think you have to kind of come at it from a very zen point of view, really, very, it's a, it's not a, it's not a instrument where you, it, you know, you're not playing the guitar and jumping in the air <laugh>. You're being really, really still. And, and that that's kind of this, it's sort of a, it's almost sort of like a yoga exercise, right. So I think, I think if I'd known that I would've, I would've had a, a better, I would've been better at the beginning. I would've had <span style="color:red" data-ts="2557.725" data-end_ts="2557.845" title="2557.725" id=c_"2557.725">__a__</span> better grasp of what, how to do this. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So is there like a certain level of stamina that you have to develop just to hold your hands in place in space properly? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>My biggest thing is just standing that still that long. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2571.865" data-end_ts="2572.085" title="2571.865" id=c_"2571.865">__Oh__</span>, oh, sure. Literally, I mean, I, you know, I, I kind of, you know, especially if I'm playing with a band and I'm standing up, which I almost always do. I mean, sometimes after a set, I just, my knees are locked. I <laugh>. Right. It's just how Right. Can't walk. So, so it's, it is more just concentration. It's that concentration. It's sort of funny. People theramos talk to each other about the thein trance. Right. Which is just this sort of like, look like you're some kind of a fugue or something <laugh> while you're playing. And it is just that sort of depth of you're listening really, really hard and you're concentrating really hard. Oh, the other tip I would say, and this is something I do, which most people not, comment on, and that is keep your amp right in your face if you possibly can. Keep it as close to your ears as you can with comfort or, you know, put it behind you. If you're playing a rock band, make it so it's the distance between the sound coming out of that amp and your ears <span style="color:red" data-ts="2627.185" data-end_ts="2627.405" title="2627.185" id=c_"2627.185">__is__</span> as close as it can be practically, because that is what you got to work with. You have to be able 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>To, your feedback circuit. Right. That 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>Is your feedback circuit. And you've gotta be able to correct that very quickly. And a lot of the correction you do is these little microtonal corrections as the notes coming up, Uhhuh, <affirmative>, and, yeah. You can't play with your amp back lined somewhere. Right. It's gonna be really hard. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That's, that's great advice. So before we go, let's, first of all, who are some, thermi theists besides yourself that you would recommend people listen to if they want to hear more? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>Oh boy. There's, there's actually one of my, my favorites right now who is a classical theist who's kind of taking the world by storm and just, he's just released a, an album with a harp player is named <span style="color:red" data-ts="2678.715" data-end_ts="2679.205" title="2678.715" id=c_"2678.715">__Theoral__</span> Jorgensen. He's from the Netherlands. He was a classical musician, and he is extraordinary, classical Therman player. Just amazing. He's got a website, he's, like I say, he is releasing a, a new CD for Harp Harp and, I think it's called Duos Harp and Thein. Okay. He is amazing. There's a, for some reason the Netherlands seems to be <span style="color:red" data-ts="2708.525" data-end_ts="2708.685" title="2708.525" id=c_"2708.525">__full__</span>. There's another, fellow who does really interesting experimental work called, Wilco <span style="color:red" data-ts="2713.655" data-end_ts="2714.005" title="2713.655" id=c_"2713.655">__Boman__</span>, who's a, an experimental theist. If you wanna hear another really tremendously good theist. There's, Armand Raw is a theist and performance artist who's Extraordinary has done, there's, there was a, a documentary released, I think last year about Armand Raw, about the kind of journey with the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2739.435" data-end_ts="2739.675" title="2739.435" id=c_"2739.435">__Emman__</span>. And it's, it's really cool. Boy, they're just, they're, they're kind of everywhere right now. Mm-Hmm. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2747.315" data-end_ts="2747.355" title="2747.315" id=c_"2747.315">__<affirmative>__</span>. I mean, you can, you can look around, but those are the, those are the ones that come to mind right away. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. And for people who want to hear more of your work, and want to experience it, where would you have them go? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>They, I have a website. It's, Victoria Lundy music.com. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>And, that's pretty much where everything I'm doing is posted at some point or another, you know, shows my links to my music. You know, if you wanna hear my goofy, angry nerd rock music with the in activists, you can go to inactivate plural.com. And, you know, we have tons of, of obnoxious, hilarious, irreverent 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Fun. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>Fun. I guess <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Fun for me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>I thought of it. Yeah. I, I have a good time. I always have a good time. They're, they're, they're just totally whacked out. Right. Our, our lead, our lead singer and primary composer is, a crazy genius. And, you know, they all are, they're tremendous musicians, so I, I really enjoy playing with them. So, yeah, that's, that's pretty much it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright. Well, Victoria, thank you again for your time and, and for, chatting with us and kind of filling us in on, on some of the details about Therman. I think it was really informative and, interesting for me since I, I mean, my one, every time I step in front of one, I just embarrassed myself. So <laugh>, it's really, first of all, good to talk to somebody who's really skilled with it. And secondly, to hear that, you know, to hear about some of the details that would've passed me by. So thank you so much for that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victoria: </b>You're welcome. Thank you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright, well, and with that, I'll <span style="color:red" data-ts="2854.145" data-end_ts="2854.365" title="2854.145" id=c_"2854.145">__bid__</span> you a good day. Bye. Now, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2861.185" data-end_ts="2861.405" title="2861.185" id=c_"2861.185">__Our__</span> problems with microphone again, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2863.625" data-end_ts="2863.845" title="2863.625" id=c_"2863.625">__and__</span> this thing has gotta go in any case, I want to thank Victoria for another great interview. It was really great to learn a lot of things about Thurman, things I hadn't even really considered about using it as a, as an interface and as an instrument. I wanted to also thank you for tuning in again, listening for sharing this with your friends. It's been a fantastic, ride for me so far, and I expect to take it a long ways into the future. So with that, I'll leave you alone for the rest of the week. I'll catch <span style="color:red" data-ts="2895.445" data-end_ts="2895.565" title="2895.445" id=c_"2895.445">__you__</span> next weekend.
