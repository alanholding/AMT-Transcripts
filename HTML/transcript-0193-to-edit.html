<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today I have the great opportunity to talk to somebody whose work I followed for a while. And also I'd say that I, I see him often, and the reason I see him often is because if your Facebook feed looks anything like mine, you see him often too. His name is Mike <span style="color:red" data-ts="27.485" data-end_ts="27.805" title="27.485" id=c_"27.485">__Monday__</span> and he is, I've seen him, spoken of as being like the, the Tony Robbins of Music Productions <laugh>. He is, he's a person that is sort of a life coach for people who are obsessed with electronic music. And so I hope that that's a fair statement. Would you say that's <span style="color:red" data-ts="48.285" data-end_ts="48.445" title="48.285" id=c_"48.285">__true__</span>? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike Monday: </b>It, it has been said <laugh>. And, I mean, <laugh>, you know, I, I have a kind of <span style="color:red" data-ts="54.325" data-end_ts="54.445" title="54.325" id=c_"54.325">__a__</span> love, hate relationship with the life, coaching world, right? And tend to think that the best kind of growth comes in the actual doing of a specific thing, unless you have an underlying, you know, mental health issue or something like that, which is something completely different. But, but, you know, self-help for <span style="color:red" data-ts="75.205" data-end_ts="75.325" title="75.205" id=c_"75.205">__help__</span>, self-help sake doesn't really, appeal to me. One of the things that I, in, in the studio realized was that actually I was using what I was doing in the studio as a tool to grow in many different ways. And, so that's where what I do now came from. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Very interesting. So, for people who aren't familiar, as familiar with you as I am, why don't I have you just explain really quickly what it is that you do as sort of like, I'll, I'll call it your gig, because it's kind of like a combination of a, a service job and a gig and, and an artistic pursuit. So why don't I have you explain it a little bit? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>Yes. So essentially, you're quite lucky actually, 'cause I just did, some thinking <span style="color:red" data-ts="118.125" data-end_ts="118.245" title="118.125" id=c_"118.125">__a__</span>, around this. And essentially I realized that what I do is I help music makers, music producers, composers, particularly in the, electronic space, expand their freedom to be more creative. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="131.885" data-end_ts="132.125" title="131.885" id=c_"131.885">__that__</span>, that sounds like one of those little taglines, doesn't it? Underneath <laugh>. It does, yes. But, but, but essentially that, that is in a nutshell, that's the kind of lift pitch. And I do that in, various different ways. The, the most obvious and the most visible way, at the moment is in helping people use their minds more effectively and their time more effectively, and their equipment more effectively, essentially. In order to make much more music, be much more creative and be innovative. No. And then, you know, there are other ways, of doing it as well by, you know, developing, other streams of income through, you know, from their music, the kind of stuff that springs from their music as well. 'cause obviously that can free up, time as well. 'cause a lot of people are stuck in that situation where they're touring all the time, right. Which, is created by the music that they make <laugh>. But when they're touring all the time, they can't make the music because it's such a punishing, schedule. Right. So I'm actually helping, you know, quite a few people who are touring all the time to make music while touring. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's fantastic. Yeah. I will say right up front that I have done some of your, your courses, particularly the one that really helped me out a lot was one called Idea Explosion, which was sort of like a way to re-approach, developing your, your music with some, some very specific exercises and spec specific strategies that kind of helped me re rethink about how I was making music and what it is that I wanted to produce. I, I found it really helpful. Great. I've also gone through your YouTube videos and, I got, you had a free download at one point called the re Magic Track re animator, which was like a great way to see if a track was worth trying to, you know, recover out of the dust bin or whatever. <span style="color:red" data-ts="241.425" data-end_ts="241.645" title="241.425" id=c_"241.425">__Yep__</span>. But I, I found your work really exciting because, you know, and I almost feel bad already about having, like, gone down the road of, of the life coach thing, because so often that is like general discussions about stuff that could fit anybody. And I would say that in your case, you have like, put together, roadmaps for how to get from point A to point B, assuming that point A and point B are, are paths on the road that music producers will run into? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>Yes, that's exactly it. I think what I, decided to do was first, approach the areas that I had the most difficulty with <laugh> in, my creative process. Because what, what, what ended up happening towards the end of my career that it was almost like the music that I was making was simply the results of my creative experiments, <laugh>. It was like, it didn't really matter what was coming out to me anyway. As much as it was almost like a kind of la a laboratory for investigating my creative process and, myself, you know, in my conversations with other people, I was meeting, I could see that I was doing things slightly differently and, and looking at it in a different way, which would really help them. That got me extremely energized and, excited as I started to do that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So now you open a door there and I'd like to go through it. And that is, the career you had, prior to taking, taking on this role of helping people, become better and more productive producers. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you were a music music producer yourself, and a fairly accomplished one. Why don't you tell me a little bit about what, what it is that you were doing and what ended up kind of being the end of that? Because what I notice is when I look at your discography, there's sort of like an end point to it, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>Yes. <laugh>, yes. There definitely was <span style="color:red" data-ts="362.885" data-end_ts="363.005" title="362.885" id=c_"362.885">__a__</span>, definitely has been an end point to it, but, you know, never say never. Yeah. So <laugh>, so, yeah, what <span style="color:red" data-ts="369.005" data-end_ts="369.165" title="369.005" id=c_"369.005">__hap__</span> what happened was I did music at Oxford University, music degree at Oxford University, and, joined, well, I didn't join, I created a funk band with a <span style="color:red" data-ts="381.725" data-end_ts="381.845" title="381.725" id=c_"381.725">__couple__</span>, a few guys, one of whom ended up being one of the members of Groove Ma, I dunno if you're familiar with them. But anyway, we came out of university and lived in a flat in South London, and he bought a e, I can't remember what it was, an <span style="color:red" data-ts="397.765" data-end_ts="398.965" title="397.765" id=c_"397.765">__E-X-E-X-S__</span> 24, I think. So he got a bank loan out, got an <span style="color:red" data-ts="401.205" data-end_ts="401.325" title="401.205" id=c_"401.205">__E__</span> Xs 24, and he did, and this massive old mixing desk, I can't remember what it was called, and some speakers and a DA recorder, and started making music pretty much with, that, and because I was there and, I, I started making music with him as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>And anyway, so we started making music as, a band called Beat Foundation that got some early success. We were one of the four tracks, I think, on the first ever Sasha Essential selection compilation. And, and so we got kind of some success in, in that sort of area. Anyway, to cut a long story short, he went on to do Groove <span style="color:red" data-ts="433.625" data-end_ts="433.845" title="433.625" id=c_"433.625">__Ma__</span> and I <span style="color:red" data-ts="435.835" data-end_ts="436.125" title="435.835" id=c_"435.835">__went__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="436.245" data-end_ts="436.365" title="436.245" id=c_"436.245">__I__</span> kind of went on eventually after a massive period of, creative block, went on to sort of become Mike Monday My, my real name is, <span style="color:red" data-ts="444.365" data-end_ts="444.725" title="444.365" id=c_"444.365">__Booker__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="444.725" data-end_ts="444.885" title="444.725" id=c_"444.725">__Path__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="444.955" data-end_ts="445.245" title="444.955" id=c_"444.955">__Half__</span> Half Indian. And anyway, so I, and, as Mike Monday I kind of got some, degree of success and yeah, that, that was it. I mean, I, I spent the latter part of my career just producing, music both for the dance floor and kind of in album form. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>And what happened towards the end was I saw the writing, you know, as, DWS started, happening. <span style="color:red" data-ts="469.405" data-end_ts="469.525" title="469.405" id=c_"469.405">__I__</span>, and I saw that the, you know, like in, in every, industry, the, commoditization of the thing, so the dis you know, the distribution and the, the, the creation of music, and, and, you know, in, in every industry it's happened where the price has gone down. So therefore, lot, lots more people are able to do it. I saw that <span style="color:red" data-ts="487.205" data-end_ts="487.325" title="487.205" id=c_"487.205">__the__</span>, the writing was on the wall for very many parts of the industry. So I started to <span style="color:red" data-ts="492.865" data-end_ts="493.085" title="492.865" id=c_"492.865">__dis__</span> well, I actually made a decision to interact with my fans more closely, and decided to start blogging about my creative process as that's one of the things I was most interested in. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And the long, and the short of it is that in doing that, I found something that really inspired me and, kind of energized me and motivated me in kind of ever deeper and, more exciting ways. So what started out as being almost like a, a way <span style="color:red" data-ts="520.125" data-end_ts="520.285" title="520.125" id=c_"520.125">__to__</span> engage with my fans for my music and promote my music, became actually the single thing that I decided to, focus on at the moment anyway. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. When you made that transition, did you, and you started blogging about your creative process, did you find that like a lot of your fans also happened to want to produce music? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>Yes. And, I mean, a lot of them were producing music. I mean, I, I would suggest that for a, certainly in the electronic space anyway, a lot of the, your, your most, the, the most Raed fans, the ones that are kind of the core fans, are also going to be either wanting to or are producing music. So, so that, that, you know, that was something I identified. And, and I mean, in order to sort of, I read the, I dunno whether, you know, the Kevin Kelly article, the, the Thousand True Fans Yes. Concept. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So I read that, at the time it came out. And, he, he put it up on his, blog. And, so I set about identifying who <laugh> were likely to be my most core fan base, and I realized <span style="color:red" data-ts="587.605" data-end_ts="587.825" title="587.605" id=c_"587.605">__it__</span> would be people who were making music, right. <laugh>. So that, that was where that kind of idea came from. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, but it's also, it was also a timely time to, to do something like that because sort of the democratization of music making really came, became pervasive in that mid two thousands timeframe. And so all of a sudden it was more likely even people that just wanted to make music, if you could help propel them into starting, they'd have access to the tools to do it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>Exactly. So there are benefits and, you know, downsides to, to everything. Right. And I think it was a, it was like, well, I could either kind of shake my fist at, at the world and what was going on, or I could, make, lemonade from lemons, and I, I, I chose the las, and, and that's kind of how I've ended up in this. I mean, if you'd have told me that was what was gonna happen, I would've, said you were crazy, but <laugh>. Right, <span style="color:red" data-ts="641.985" data-end_ts="642.185" title="641.985" id=c_"641.985">__right__</span>. You know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Going to music school at Oxford and getting chops enough to, to be doing the kind of production work that you were doing kind of implies, some musical background before then. What was your youth like? What kind of, what kind of background came from that that helped you become sort of the, both the musician, but also the, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="664.415" data-end_ts="664.905" title="664.415" id=c_"664.415">__inspire__</span> that you are, what, what's your background that puts you in a position to do that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>I think, the, the kind of overarching thing is that because I'm half, Indian and half English. Okay. I was, I was born in Calcutta and, moved to, the UK when I was like a little baby, like about two years old or something. But my first breaths and my first sounds and everything that I heard, and it was very, very alien. I mean, it was Calcutta in the seventies. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So that was, well, I mean, still is an intense place, but it was even more of an in intense place. And we moved to the center of England, the black country, which, at that time was a very working class area. So, had certain, you know, views on race, <laugh>, a lot of people did. And I, and so it was kind of like, I, I've always been an alien, you know, where wherever I've gone and, I'm white, but I have Indian blood. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And so I was very often in a situation where I was in the uncomfortable situation to be exposed to things not directed at me, but which impacted me <laugh>. Right, right. You know, into, and so this gave me a kind of, objective view of, people and, humanity. Right. Which I think has allowed me to kind of draw parallels between various, different things. So that's the kind of overarching thing is, is that I generally see things, from a kind of outside perspective. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I, I think that that's actually, I wouldn't say that that's common, but I think that, that some people have been able to do that. This sense of alienation from normal life kind of puts you in a position to be introspective at an early age. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>Yes. And I was an only, I was an only child as well. So I think that probably comes into it, as well. So I think, yeah. But then in terms of the music, side of it, I mean, I wasn't from a family, of, musicians at all, but, my mum used to play a lot of music, around the house, mainly classical. And I started the piano when I was seven, and then went on to do the bassoon saxophone. And I was a choral scholar at Oxford University. I was in the National Youth Orchestra playing the, the, the double bassoon. I see. So kind of classically trained. And I just <span style="color:red" data-ts="792.845" data-end_ts="793.045" title="792.845" id=c_"792.845">__did__</span>, did, lots of things, but I was always surrounded by people. I was never the best musician in the room. Never. I was always the one of the worst. You know, and I think that, that, that has gone on throughout, my career, even though I, I did a music degree and everything, I was always surrounded by these kind of what I sort of saw as, geniuses. And I always struggled, with the creative process. And I think that's also, and just with music, it never came easy to me. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>And in fact, I don't think it comes easy to, to anyone to be honest. But I, the perception, my perception was that there were people who kind of, they just kind of had to sit down and this amazing stuff came out on their fingers, <laugh>. Right, right. And for, for me, it was always a, struggle. And I actually started to appreciate that, that struggle towards the end of, my career. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's really interesting. Now, I'm kind <span style="color:red" data-ts="841.525" data-end_ts="841.605" title="841.525" id=c_"841.525">__of__</span> curious, do, do you feel like this like roommate, thing that you did, did that somehow activate you into doing music just because all of a sudden there was some gear available and you had the opportunity to try it? Or was that something that you had kind of secretly hosted in your brain up prior to that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>Oh, okay. Yeah. So I'm definitely much more of an opportunist. So yes, it wasn't a, a, predetermined, plan. So it was, it was just kind of what I fell into. So I actually wanted to be a saxophonist. Ah, originally that was my, that was the plan. It's, it's funny, I'm on this podcast because I've listened to some of your, other episodes with, you know, people who were fully immersed in the, the world of, you know, that kind of intersection between, music and tech. And I always counted myself as a technophobe <laugh>. Ah, right. You know, and so the figuring out of how to make music with midi at the time was, you know, one of the biggest mountains I've ever had to climb, you know, without YouTube <span style="color:red" data-ts="903.985" data-end_ts="904.205" title="903.985" id=c_"903.985">__cho__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="904.225" data-end_ts="904.445" title="904.225" id=c_"904.225">__two__</span> tours and all that kind of stuff at the time. 'cause it was <span style="color:red" data-ts="905.965" data-end_ts="906.125" title="905.965" id=c_"905.965">__in__</span>, it was 94 when, when I started, it actually showed me that I wasn't a, I wasn't a complete technical no hope. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>It was just a case of, learning something and, and figuring it out. But it was never really, I was never interested in the machines for the machine's sake. It was always, for me, it was always what the machines can do. So it was always getting to an end result, which was a piece of music. That was the, the reason I was doing absolutely everything. And at the point at which it worked, that was it. There wasn't any, with me anyway, figuring out how this synth works Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> or all the things this synth can do. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> it was figuring out how I make a piece of music with this synth Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>Which is a kind of, I think it's a fundamentally different, energy to it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It is. But I think that what you kind of talk about, right, there is a trap that a lot of people get into. They get so interested in what a machine can do that they forget that the primary purpose of it was to make music. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>Having said that, though, if you are naturally interested in that, then that can be a wonderful thing to, to do. Well, unless of course you just want to become a kind of an expert on sound design, you know, unless you want to actually become a sound designer Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, that's something different. But if you want to produce music, then that thing can be something that, that will really inform and enrich your music. But it has to be in the context of finishing stuff. And I think people do mistake the interest in that with the purpose of it. Exactly. As, as you said, and it's, you know, I, I was like, you can make a great piece of music with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1001.765" data-end_ts="1001.885" title="1001.765" id=c_"1001.765">__the__</span> dust <span style="color:red" data-ts="1002.205" data-end_ts="1002.285" title="1002.205" id=c_"1002.205">__bin__</span> lid <laugh>. Right. You know, if you take, the right approach and you, you practice enough <laugh> Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> essentially. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>So I, I think that's the, you know, I, I kind of view these <span style="color:red" data-ts="1013.105" data-end_ts="1013.325" title="1013.105" id=c_"1013.105">__all__</span>, all of these things as tools, but I think it's, I it's being able to identify what it is that excites, motivates and energizes you and doubling down on that thing, and almost like ignoring everything else. You know? That's what I encourage a lot of my, clients to do, is like, what is the thing that you love more than anything else? And if that is designing sounds on a synth, then how can you <span style="color:red" data-ts="1039.075" data-end_ts="1039.235" title="1039.075" id=c_"1039.075">__all__</span>, you know, how would you make a piece of music where you only ha where you could only do that? Right. You know, or at least you, you minimize everything else, and that is your thing. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's actually, that's actually interesting to consider because, and I have to say for myself, I tend to think of there being almost a dichotomy of there's sound design or there's music making, and the two are like fundamentally different things to do. But that what you're saying is really, is really important, which is that one of 'em isn't necessarily preferable to the other. It's just you have to have a goal of what you wanna do and pursue that goal instead of pursuing all possible goals. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>But that's exactly it. And I think the, the problem that a lot of people who are starting out, mu music producers is <span style="color:red" data-ts="1089.005" data-end_ts="1089.125" title="1089.005" id=c_"1089.005">__that__</span> because all information to do absolutely everything is available immediately for free. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> that brings along with it the assumption that you need to know everything in order to do anything. The trouble is if you know everything, I mean, you know, I was, talking to, one of my mastermind members the other day and I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1106.005" data-end_ts="1106.205" title="1106.005" id=c_"1106.005">__said__</span>, and I think if you did know everything about all of the possible things that you could do, you would probably end up writing lift music, <laugh>. You know what I mean? If you attempted to u to use all of the techniques available and all of the equipment, then it would just be nothing. Right. And it's like this not being able to do certain things, then we'll inform your music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>Like, it can be certain things and it cannot be other things. And that's great. That's exactly what you want. You know? So I do encourage, the people. I, I help to figure out what, what it is they can do now with what they have now, rather than always waiting. 'cause there are so many different things that, are waiting to make great music. And I, I see people doing it all, all the time. Oh, I'll, I'll finish, you know, I'll finish this album when I've learned this, or when I've bought that bit of gear, or when I've, and it's like, well, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1155.125" data-end_ts="1155.405" title="1155.125" id=c_"1155.125">__what__</span>, what can you do now? Because those limitations, those things that you don't have are as important to the end result as, as what you do have. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I've seen some like tragic, cases of that too. There was, there was somebody I knew was a phenomenally talented kid. He was sure that as soon as he gets that next piece of gear, then he's finally gonna be set and he could start working. And it made me sad because every time he would get on any piece of gear, it just, music flowed out of him in a wonderful way. Yeah. But he couldn't mentally allow himself to make music until he had reached some kind of gear purchasing goal. And that was, that was a little unfortunate. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>Yes. It does happen. And a lot of people who, who come to me are in that situation, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, I, I was gonna ask you, have you ever had a situation where, after talking to somebody, you said, you know, it sounds like your real goal is to be a gear collector. And so focus on that <laugh>, or have you, have you always found a way to help them make at least some music? I, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>I think if they were, they got to the point at which they were actually, speaking to me, I think they will <span style="color:red" data-ts="1220.765" data-end_ts="1220.925" title="1220.765" id=c_"1220.765">__have__</span> already made the decision that they don't want to be a gear collector, just a gear collector. Maybe the ge Yeah. So maybe the gear collection is a, is a, an advanced form of procrastination. Right. So, so what they're actually doing is using the purchasing of a a, a piece of gear as a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1238.465" data-end_ts="1238.685" title="1238.465" id=c_"1238.465">__fee__</span>. They get that feeling that they're doing something useful. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, which is kind of avoiding the, the actual thing. 'cause I think, you know, I, I, I'm going <span style="color:red" data-ts="1246.725" data-end_ts="1246.805" title="1246.725" id=c_"1246.725">__to__</span> contradict myself now, but I said, you know, so I was never one of those people for which music comes easy. Well, I think that is probably just a, a function of <laugh> kind of my past and my beliefs about myself. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>'cause I don't actually think that music comes easy to, to anyone all the time. And at some point you are going to face that barrier of finishing something. Right. You know, that inevitable. And it's just a function of the social fear that we have of, of judgment, you know, which, which basically is processed in the same part of our brain in the same way as <span style="color:red" data-ts="1279.145" data-end_ts="1279.365" title="1279.145" id=c_"1279.145">__the__</span>, the fear of death. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Because I think, scientists thought that, think that because our brains are essentially the same, same as when we were, you know, hunter-gatherers to be ostracized from the tribe was to die. Right. So therefore, it's processed in the same way. So whenever you finish a piece of music, you are facing that which to your, to your mind is the fear of death. And I think people thi hope or want that piece of gear to kind of be the solution to not feeling that fear of judgment. 'cause they mistake the doubt that comes at the end of the process. You know, that. So you've loved it. You've been <span style="color:red" data-ts="1314.365" data-end_ts="1314.525" title="1314.365" id=c_"1314.365">__got__</span> you, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1314.705" data-end_ts="1314.925" title="1314.705" id=c_"1314.705">__we__</span> really go for it. You're like, oh, this is amazing. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1316.385" data-end_ts="1316.605" title="1316.385" id=c_"1316.385">__And__</span>, and then at the end of the process, there comes this doubt. And they mistake that for reality when <span style="color:red" data-ts="1320.845" data-end_ts="1320.965" title="1320.845" id=c_"1320.845">__a__</span>, when actually what all it is, is a signpost that you're about to finish. It's like, oh, I'm about to finish. Oh, there's gonna be judgment <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>And that's it. And so they go and buy a piece of gear just to, to kind of put it off. Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1333.405" data-end_ts="1333.565" title="1333.405" id=c_"1333.405">__Put__</span>, put off the inevitable. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's an interesting perspective, because one of the things I know I, and a lot of people have trouble doing is, is finishing pieces. But it oftentimes, it, it does seem to be, sometimes starting a piece can be hard because you might not feel inspired. Or sometimes continuing to work on a piece might feel, might, might be hard because you're not sure that it's going in a useful direction. But there's something about coming to the end of a piece. It's, it's like your mind works over time to just find problems. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1369.825" data-end_ts="1370.045" title="1369.825" id=c_"1369.825">__Oh__</span>, this sounds like mud. Oh, this doesn't sound complex enough. Oh, people are gonna think that you're, you didn't use enough chords. Or people are gonna think you're trying to use too many chords, <laugh>, or whatever, you know? Yeah. And it's amazing the kind of things you'll conjure up in your head in order to try and give yourself the, an excuse to not <span style="color:red" data-ts="1389.045" data-end_ts="1389.165" title="1389.045" id=c_"1389.045">__continue__</span>, not finish. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>Absolutely. It's, it, it's one of the things that I get people to focus on is all of those thoughts and feelings that come up in the creative process is, is detaching from them and understanding that they're not real. They're just things that come up. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And how can it be that at, at one point in the process, you are absolutely overjoyed with excitement, and then with essentially what is the same piece of music later on in the process, that you are absolutely terrified. Has the music changed enough for, for <span style="color:red" data-ts="1423.015" data-end_ts="1423.215" title="1423.015" id=c_"1423.015">__there__</span>, for there to be those two different states of being about the music? No, all that's happened is that you're at a different stage in the process. So kind of attaching, like believing all of those sorts and feelings in the moment about the music is actually not a particularly good way of moving forward. What you have to do is almost keep moving forward no matter what, say that you finished, and then almost curate all of the moments, all of your feelings about that piece of music over time. And then come to a decision 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>As to whether you are going to release it onto the, onto an unsuspecting public or not, <laugh> and <laugh>. And it's like, I, I think that the mistake is tr like, I call it actually the tyranny of like, Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So the one thing that we all naturally use to either move forward or not move forward is, do I like this? The trouble is that our odometer is extremely unreliable and, based upon all kinds of inputs, which aren't to do with the music. So it's kind of like detaching from that and allowing yourself not to believe all of those, feelings about the music in the moment. You're not always right. I mean, how many times have you loved something one minute, and then on a totally different day, you're like, what, what on earth was I thinking? Right? And the other way around, I mean, you know, but yet we still use this. I like it now. So therefore it's true <laugh> Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know? Right. And I, I think it's just about kind of, detaching from it, making progress no matter what, and then deciding what you're gonna take forward and what you're not gonna take forward. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, one of the things that you do, a lot in your work, both in the, I noticed this was the case in the videos that are freely available on YouTube, it was in the course that I took, and it seems to be sort of like a bedrock in your method. And in fact, it's even sort of in built into some of your taglines, you have this one tagline that's like, start now, finish fast. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> what you're, what you seem to really be focused on is almost saying Get off your butt is more important than extending your talent or worrying about your ability or anything else. That, that doing stuff is the key. I mean, to the point where you get involved in discussions about distractions and how distracting the computer can be. I'm sure my podcast has distracted plenty of people from getting good work done. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>I'm sure my, my, anti distraction videos <span style="color:red" data-ts="1573.765" data-end_ts="1574.045" title="1573.765" id=c_"1573.765">__have__</span> distracted <span style="color:red" data-ts="1574.485" data-end_ts="1574.605" title="1574.485" id=c_"1574.485">__me__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> <laugh>. Right. Good point. Good point. But, given that, or where in that fits in the role of being good at your instrument or getting better at your instrument, or learning more about production, how do you balance those things? When do you say, okay, you've done some work, now it's time to hone your skills in how to use a compressor. Or it's time for you to learn a new set of chords on that guitar or something like that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>So I'm, I'm gonna question the question. Okay. You are creating a false dichotomy. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1609.125" data-end_ts="1609.245" title="1609.125" id=c_"1609.125">__Okay__</span>. What I would suggest anyway. Good. It could be a false dichotomy there. So you're saying either you do stuff or you get better at your craft. Ah, how do you, how do you get better at your craft by doing stuff? Right. Right. That's the simple answer to all of it. Learning, learn. The, the, the all the learning that you do, whatever method you use to learn always, always has to end if it's going to be learning that is practical and not just, learning that ends in you becoming a music production shooter. There's nothing wrong with a music production shooter, by the way. But, but I'm just saying, you know, just the actual, in terms of being a music producer, all of that learning at some point needs to be applied to produce a piece of music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I, I get sort of fairly militant about it, is that if you have limited time and energy to hone your craft, then why not do the only learning that is 100% necessary? The only learning that is necessary is the learning that you do in applying your craft. Everything else, everything else is optional. That doesn't mean I'm not devaluing it, I'm not saying that it's that it's not something you might want to do. I'm not saying any of that. But all I'm saying is all of it is optional. Apart from the learning, and this is where I actually believe the real learning happens, is in the doing, doing the thing. So instead of learning about the thing, let's start doing the thing first and do that at the start. This is what I suggest. It depends on your kind of, body clock and stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>But what I suggest is doing that first, and if you have time, do the learning that supplements it, but make sure you get that done first. The, the doing of the thing, because the doing of the thing actually allows, it, it suggests things for you to learn. Right? So out of the, out of the, the process of actually finishing a piece of music, you'll go, well, I wanna learn about that, but I'm not gonna do it now. I'm gonna write it down on a piece of pa in, in my journal, and I'm going to keep on finishing what I'm finishing, and then I will have a list of things that I might want to learn instead of watching Netflix this evening. And then I'm going to, I'm gonna do that. Now, for me, I went to Oxford University and did a very academic degree in music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>I did all my music theory and everything, and as a composer of music as a result of all of the, I mean, it probably, I mean, it's arguable, well, in some senses, academically, speaking, it could be, could be argued that I had a, an enviable music musical education. Right. So as a result of all that, I felt, very, I wasn't very confident as a composer of music as a musician now in the learning of the production of music. So the knobs <laugh>, essentially twiddling the knobs and, doing the faders. I did none of that. Not a single thing. I figured it out myself. I did it in, in the process of doing it. And I felt very confident as a music producer now that I might be completely deluded about that may, maybe I was no good at anything. I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1803.885" data-end_ts="1804.165" title="1803.885" id=c_"1803.885">__dunno__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>But just in the result of the two different ways I learned those two different kind of things, I came out of my career being, I dunno, it just like when I was mixing things, when I was, kind of doing the, the production side of it, I was just very confident I could just do it. Whereas in the composition, it was like this, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1824.065" data-end_ts="1824.285" title="1824.065" id=c_"1824.065">__oh__</span>, <laugh>. And, and, and bear in mind this isn't because I was naturally gifted at the technical side of, of stuff. As I've already said, I came into this as a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1833.605" data-end_ts="1834.165" title="1833.605" id=c_"1833.605">__technico__</span>. So I, I'm, I'm suggesting that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1837.265" data-end_ts="1837.485" title="1837.265" id=c_"1837.265">__my__</span>, this approach of the doing of the thing is where you learn and all of the rest of it is optional, was the result of, you know, that came about as a result of the way that I learned. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's very interesting and it, and it kind of parallels an experience I had. I went to school, actually, I went to a jazz school, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1854.845" data-end_ts="1854.965" title="1854.845" id=c_"1854.845">__a__</span> jazz performance school. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, I, and this class of many jazz guitarists worked really hard on scales and form chord forms and all this kind of stuff. And I noticed that at the end of my studies with them, none of them ever did anything as jazz guitarists. They were very technically capable of doing jazz guitar, but none of 'em were jazz guitarists. But if I would watch them on weekends, they would go out and play in rock bands where they had just kinda learned it by doing it. And they were phenomenal players and they, they had a lot of joy in it. There's, there's something too about when you learn that way, there's joy in it for you. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>Yeah. Ab absolutely. I think this is all pointing to a question that is kind of constantly in my mind <span style="color:red" data-ts="1900.205" data-end_ts="1900.365" title="1900.205" id=c_"1900.205">__and__</span> haven't kind of figured it out yet. And that's the difference between art and craft. Yeah. So there is a difference. Yeah. So for instance, you can have an absolutely amazing piece of music that is technically not very good. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And you can have an absolutely terrible piece of music <laugh> that is technically perfect. Right. And I think that is, that is the kind of, discussion. Have you, have you read a book by Victor Wooten called The Music Lesson? Yes, I have. Yes. So, that, that kind of also kind of touches on that area It does about, you know, what practices and what music is. And I mean, I think I, I try to 'cause with all of the wonderful people out there providing all of this information for free about vsts and synthesizers and, you know, all of that kind of thing, it's absolutely fantastic. But it does lead us sometimes I think, to forget about the art involved. I think, because, you know, it's kind of teaching all of the, the people how, how this thing works and how to make this kind of sound and <laugh> all of that kind of thing. And I, I've noticed certainly with the kind of a lot of the younger generation as I see it anyway, which is my, my my perspective, that it's almost like they're focusing on the wrong things first. You know, it's the notes Mozart <laugh>. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>That's kind of what that, I mean, you know, I'm, I'm being slightly facetious, but you know, I, I I feel that, let's think about the art first and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1979.905" data-end_ts="1980.125" title="1979.905" id=c_"1979.905">__no__</span>, the craft couldn't be sorted <laugh>. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, one of the things I would say is, recently, because it's kind of been more available, I've kind of gotten entranced by some of the writings of like the modern stoics, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, it seems like a lot of what you talk about kind of touches on a similar vein to what they talk about, you know, this, this idea of stay focused on doing, don't let your brain tear down your, your ability to get the job done. That sometimes grit is of great value. How much of the concepts that you've developed have come from those kind of philosophies and how much have come from just talking to people and find out what they're successful with? I'm curious where, where your well comes from. Where is your Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>I think it's mainly, it mainly springs from talking to people initially, it came from my own creative process Okay. And my own experiences essentially, like figuring out what it was that I found the most difficult and what my solutions were to, to those, difficulties I read as widely as I possibly can. All kinds of stuff. And I kind of go through phases. So recently I've been in the science fiction phase and I haven't read fiction for years. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, all kinds of areas. I don't specifically go to one area. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2064.325" data-end_ts="2064.445" title="2064.325" id=c_"2064.325">__And__</span> it's, funnily enough, I haven't read too much of, the stoics, but although what I, what I have read, I I'm definitely nodding my head, through it, <laugh>. Okay. Something else that I've been told a lot is that a, a lot of the way, the ways that I describe things, people assume that I'm a Buddhist uhhuh <affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>And <span style="color:red" data-ts="2082.365" data-end_ts="2082.485" title="2082.365" id=c_"2082.365">__I__</span>, I mean, I had no idea what that meant. I mean, I, I've been meditating for years, but not as a Buddhist, just as a, as a, a kind of, almost like an effectiveness tool. I've been, meditating for years, but I, I then investigated Buddhism and I, and like what the <laugh>, it's funny so much of what the Buddha talks about, I'm like, I mean, not that I'm saying I'm anything like the Buddha, goodness me. No, but I'm, I'm just saying, I, I, I'm nodding in agreement to that as well. So I think when you actually look at your experience in an objective way, as is possible, <laugh> and, and part of being objective is known that you can never really be objective, you will notice that a lot of this ancient wisdom, if you wanna put it all under that <span style="color:red" data-ts="2120.085" data-end_ts="2120.285" title="2120.085" id=c_"2120.085">__un__</span> umbrella, is actually pointing to something that is very true, you know, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>Right. So, I don't, I don't necessarily think, I mean, it's kind of, it's the same, thing as the, the previous discussion we just had, which is that the best teacher, the best mentor, the best coach that you can ever hope for is in your experience of doing something. And it's like the, the constant observation of you doing things is all you really need. I, I would suggest that's where all these, philosophies spring from. So I think there, there isn't really one particular area I, I take it from, it's in the actual doing of the thing that everything becomes, clear. So, yeah. Once again, I'm coming back to the doing <laugh>. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Do you do much music anymore, or, or, is that something that you kind of watch from a far now? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>Yeah. I decided not to do any music for a while. When I first sold something to do with this, it was partly just because I needed a break, I feel. Right, right. But also because, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2188.845" data-end_ts="2189.125" title="2188.845" id=c_"2188.845">__dunno__</span>, there was something about feeling like there was some kind of conflict of interest going on there. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> where, whereas, you know, I started doing this as a way of promoting my music, you know, as a kind of a way of talking about my music. But then when I started to sell the thing, then it felt like that wasn't right somehow right at that moment anyway. And, and I just wanted to focus on the people I was helping and their music rather than always thinking about, oh, you know, how can this help my music? And Sure. That kind of thing. And I just decided to sell all my equipment, but I burnt my bridges and <laugh> because I kept on getting asked to do this, that and the other. And I felt like one of those aging bank robbers from, from the movies, just one more job <laugh>. I was like, right, I need to sell all this stuff. So I, I sold my speakers, sold out absolutely everything, and here I am. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Wow. In a way that makes sense, because I would imagine given what you do and talking to people that you do, you know, they're going to want to say, oh, if I could only get him to work on my track, but in doing so, that, that, that would feel like a conflict as well. Yes. There would be this constant difficulty in, in figuring out how to manage that kind of stuff. So saying, I'm just not doing it probably is the most sensible way to approach it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>It is. And it was, it was very strange actually. I had a kind of grieving process for that. The music producer in me, Uhhuh <affirmative>, I couldn't, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2269.125" data-end_ts="2269.285" title="2269.125" id=c_"2269.125">__this__</span>, I couldn't actually listen to music for about six months. Oh wow. I found it really, really painful. And, now I happily listen to music and I don't, and what wonderful. This is something that I wasn't, didn't expect would happen. I can now listen to music without analyzing it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>It's such a, such a relief <laugh>. Oh 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Geez. I wish I could do that. Because I'll tell you, I can't listen to music when I drive or when I'm trying to accomplish anything because my ma brain immediately starts breaking down the production of the track, breaking down the background singers, you know? Ooh, that was a cool little twist of harmony, you know? And the next thing I know, I'm plowing into a bridge. Right. <laugh>. Yeah. Can't be doing that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>Yeah. I, I don't, I don't do that anymore. I can, I can listen to it and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2312.665" data-end_ts="2312.885" title="2312.665" id=c_"2312.665">__it__</span> simply enjoy <span style="color:red" data-ts="2314.785" data-end_ts="2315.005" title="2314.785" id=c_"2314.785">__ah__</span>,

<p>

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, unfortunately our time is pretty much evaporated. It's been really interesting to talk to you and, and kind of explore different, you know, different ways that you think about, about the landscape for people who have found this interesting and want to know more. Why don't you tell us where to find out more about, about the services that you provide and, give us kind of a quick overview of what those services kind of look like. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>Well, my website is Mike Monday dot com, and that's where most things are. I do one-to-one coaching. I also run, some group what I call Mastermind. So that's like groups of, music producers. And we meet online every two weeks. And then I have all kinds of, online courses. I have, a kind of membership continuity program where I'm setting people specific goals to do every week, half of which are in the studio. So I kind of set people these creative games to play with themselves, which result in a piece of music, at the end of it. And also things to do outside of the studio, some of which are kind of, sort of your ideal future or thinking about, you know, developing different income streams. So I do that as well. And that's called Mission, make Music Your Life. And then I have kind of the standalone courses, one of which you've done, you know, idea explosion <span style="color:red" data-ts="2399.045" data-end_ts="2399.245" title="2399.045" id=c_"2399.045">__start__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2399.245" data-end_ts="2399.325" title="2399.245" id=c_"2399.245">__to__</span> happen fast. But yeah, I, the moment I'm really enjoying and really fo focused on, interacting directly with music producers. So the, the, the one-to-one coaching that I do tends to be with the, the kind of successful music producers and DJs, successful in financial terms. I don't that that word successful is, is

<b>Darwin: </b>Success comes in many different forms. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. And the Masterminds are kind of with highly motivated, music producers of all different, kinds from people who are kind of just starting out to people who've been doing it for a, a very, long time. So yeah, there's, there's all kinds of things going on. I I'm really getting a lot of energy, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2439.365" data-end_ts="2439.525" title="2439.365" id=c_"2439.365">__in__</span>, in terms of that unique ability and being fascinated and motivated. What I love doing more than anything else is actually helping people directly by speaking to them.

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's been great speaking to you. This was, this was a fantastic chat. Thank you so much for your time. I really appreciate it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>Thank you Darwin. Much appreciate it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And there you have it. My discussion with Mike <span style="color:red" data-ts="2474.765" data-end_ts="2475.045" title="2474.765" id=c_"2474.765">__Monday__</span> about the work that he's doing and how he got there. I find his stuff incredible. I'm a real believer in both what he says and how he says it. If you haven't run into his work before, you probably wanna start off by checking out either Mike Mondaycom or checking out the free videos on YouTube. But from there, I strongly suggest you get on his mailing list at least every once in a while he puts out freebies that, are really some helpful stuff. So thanks again for listening. Keep on hanging on. We're, getting really close to good old number 200. So I'm excited to get there and beyond. And if you have any questions, comments or whatever, drop me a line ddg@cyclingseventyfour.com and we'll get it rolling from there.
