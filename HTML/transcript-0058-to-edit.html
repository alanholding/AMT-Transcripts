<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today I have a really special guest. I'm really excited about this. I'm speaking to Andrew Kilpatrick from Kilpatrick Audio. This is a phenomenally, talented guy and, someone who's doing work in, modular synthesis and, and just synthesizer development that I find really, really exciting. Hi Andrew. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew Kilpatrick: </b>I'm okay. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm great. Awesome. Thanks, for taking the time out to do this. No problem. It's, kind of late on a, on a mon Tuesday evening. So, just my listeners get a chance to understand, when we're doing this exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I have got about a million questions already, but, I try and honor a tradition here <span style="color:red" data-ts="63.32" data-end_ts="63.48" title="63.32" id=c_"63.32">__in__</span> the podcast, which is to say, that my first question is to ask you to give me some information about your background and, how you've come to do the things you do. So what, I should introduce you a little more clearly. What you do is you create synthesizer modules. You started off in the Euro world. Yep. Then you developed your own format. That's right. And now you're actually looking at building a standalone device of some sort too. Right. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>That's really, really new. It just was announced this past week. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, with that, what is your background and how did you get to the point of being a synth modular synth designer? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>The story's a little bit roundabout. I mean, I've been doing music since I was really, really young. I studied violin, since I was three, like Suzuki violin and stuff like that. Okay. And, went to an art school in, in my public school from grade six to eight, and got involved in, you know, every aspect of performing arts basically. But I was always doing technology as well, computer programming and playing with electronics and things like that. And, I was lucky enough to go to a high school that had an electronics department, so I kind of soaked in as much knowledge as I could from the, the teachers that were there. And there was this one teacher who was really amazing and sort of gave me special things to work on. 'cause I was sort of like, I would just stay after school and keep doing more projects and things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>And sort of, my academic career wasn't as maybe, good <laugh> as, as I would've hoped in terms of like pure science and math. So, I had been studying voice for a while, like operatic singing. And so when it came time to go to university, my parents said, you gotta go to university. So I, couldn't do engineering or computer science because I didn't really have the, the grades for that. So I went into music instead in voice performance, in London, Ontario, in Canada, the University of Western Ontario. And, did, I did three years there. I didn't really finish my degree. I kind of got what I wanted out of it, <laugh> Right. And, realized that a paper wasn't gonna do anything for me in terms of what I wanted to do next. And so I was always doing music and audio and technology and electronics stuff all the time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>I did a lot of sound for live performances. I did shows and festivals and things, running a soundboard operator and, doing that kind of stuff. And so I kind of got into technology in the early two thousands, because it seemed like the thing to do. And a lot of my friends were getting into that. And so I, I just sort of worked on all kinds of different projects, mostly hardware and embedded projects. Doing digital advertising, like digital signage. I, I had a company for a while doing stuff in the lighting control area and kind of, I always wanted to combine music and audio and electronics together in my own products. But it just, at that time, everyone was really getting into like, software synthesizers. And I'm not really a math guy, so that didn't seem my, like, my thing. And, it sort of took until the hardware thing started to become popular again for me to <span style="color:red" data-ts="278.36" data-end_ts="278.56" title="278.36" id=c_"278.36">__say__</span>, see that there was like a place for me to do my thing, with all the sort of background and interests that I had. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>So, you know, fast forward a few jobs and a few different types of, projects later, <laugh>. And I found myself kind of doing the, stuff in the evenings. I had a little studio in like a rock and roll building, which was awful. And I just would go there and I had my lab set up and I would work on guitar effect pedals and amps and things. And, and, realized I needed to sort of focus on music electronics as a full-time job. So I, I, quit my job and I sold my, apartment. And, that let me live for a, a year and a half or so to figure out exactly what I was doing. And the rest is history, as they say. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. So, if, when I go to your website, I notice in sort of the list of discontinued products, a whole series of guitar pedals mm-hmm. <affirmative>, those, were those the first things that you created? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Yeah. I sort of, the, the first thing I worked on when I decided I wanted to, you know, seriously pursue doing like an actual, like formal business, the only reason I, honestly, I did a business. I'm not, I'm not much of a business person, you know, in terms of being good at that. But I just wanted to sort of have a formal outlet for the work I was doing. Mm-hmm. And at that time, I was playing a lot of guitar, and I kind of, what really, you know, started everything, which is kind of a bit, funny actually, is I had a fender hot rod, deluxe amp, and I took it to the cottage and the reverb tank broke. It must've just like fell fallen apart in the car, some <laugh>. And I, and I was like, oh, darn, my reverb's broken. And then I started looking around for what I could replace it with, like a pedal or something. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>'cause I didn't really ever like the spring sound too much. Right. And, and I, I saw, okay, you know what, there's reverb pedals, but I thought it would be neat to have a delay pedal too. And there was nothing on the market at the time that kind of did what I wanted. And so I'd sort of been toying with the idea of working on some audio circuits, and I kind of just decided I would just make my own. And that's kind of, then I realized, oh, wait, maybe I could like do these as a, like a product. 'cause I, I built other, like, manufactured electronics before, not for, for myself. Right. I did a product, you know, I did a whole bunch of, like in-house projects and things for a company that I'd been working for before. So it seemed sort of natural that I would, you know, call up my metal guy, call up, you know, the P c b assemblers and figure out how I could put something together. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>And then I started making the kind of guitar effects that I wanted in my own setup. And, you know, they didn't sell very well at first. It's hard to figure out how to get those out. I did end up getting most of my sales, through a, a store in Toronto that, that was really good and they ordered a lot of them. But, but yeah, that's kind of, that kind of got me going and made, it made me realize that this was like something really, you know, that was, was perfectly suited to my personality or whatever. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's, that's really interesting. Now I have to say, I, I have, gone through the process of manufacturing exactly one item, which was, based on my master's thesis. I did a little module that, called the Hardcore that embeds an Arduino in a module. Okay. Right. And, when you say something like, well, I'll just, I just called my metal guy and I called my PC fab guy. You have to understand <laugh> that for me. I'm just overwhelmed by what you just said there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Well, it <span style="color:red" data-ts="512.84" data-end_ts="513.04" title="512.84" id=c_"512.84">__did__</span>, it, it doesn't come easy, let me tell you. Okay. <laugh>, it's like, you know, this isn't, it's, yeah. I'd been working in the, in the industry for a long time doing basically electronics engineering and mm-hmm. <affirmative> and, and metal enclosures and various things, you know, packaging for electronics. I was doing things like, you know, like mall displays, like for, right. For L <span style="color:red" data-ts="534.8" data-end_ts="534.92" title="534.8" id=c_"534.8">__c__</span> d screens and things. So I had sort of had a sense of, you know, I'm not a, an artist per se in terms of like industrial design, but I kind of sort of, I kind of just did it <span style="color:red" data-ts="545.76" data-end_ts="546" title="545.76" id=c_"545.76">__till__</span> I got good at it, <laugh> Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You knew how to, you knew how to pull the pieces together. And I knew, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>You know, I knew how to see if something looked good and I knew how to sort of, and, and after a while, I think doing that you started figure out what the materials can do for you in terms of sheet metal, for instance. You know, you start to get a sense of what stuff's expensive, what kind of things people kind of gripe about when you send them your drawings. And I started, I started going through that process and trying to figure out, you know, how can I use this, for my, for my own, you know, ideas instead of just doing things for other people. And I think that that's, it's a, you know, I think it's having a, having had a lot of different experiences working for different kinds of organizations and doing different types of work, I think, you know, you end up with a, a series of skills. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Like, I know a lot of people who, you know, they don't think of it about it like that probably because they're right in the heat of the moment. But later on, you know, I, whenever a young person asks me like, well, what should I do? I, I tell them like, do lots of things <laugh>. Right. 'cause, you know, because it's, you always draw on those experiences later and you, you think, oh, well, I need to make an enclosure. Well, okay, I already know how to do that. I can use three D cad, and I, I know this guy, west of the city and you know, this company that makes stuff at a good price. And the quality's really good. So, you know, and those are the kinds of, you know, those are industry contacts and kind of knowing like how it goes and how much it will cost, and sort of be able to estimate things like that, that stuff is really valuable. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>And you can, like, the best way to do that is to do it for other people first, obviously. Right. Where you're spending your own money. So I kind of, you know, I kind of just drew together all the things that I'd been working on. And I, and I felt like it was kind of like time in history in terms of everyone was starting to get into this. You know, I'm not the only one. Of course. And it was also, you know, for me it was the right time where I was kind of doing what I was doing and not that excited about it anymore, and sort of wanted something different. So I, you know, does that sort of paint a good picture as <span style="color:red" data-ts="670.84" data-end_ts="670.96" title="670.84" id=c_"670.84">__the__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It it does, but it's also, it also paints a really good inspirational picture. I like this concept of telling people to do lots of things because it's, it's the, through those breadths of ex of experience that you actually are able to kind of pivot into whatever your, your calling ends up being. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>I think. So I think, you know, like I've, I've had, you know, interns before doing engineering stuff, and I've met a lot of students. I'm part of a hacker space community in, in Toronto. Okay. And so we got a lot of young people coming in saying, you know, Hey, you know, this is really cool what you're doing. How do I do this? And, you know, the biggest mistake I think people make, and it's not usually their fault, like, you know, is young people are influenced often by their parents. Right. Parents see it as, you know, you get your grades, you go to school, you get a degree, and that's, then you're all set to go. But I think that that's probably only part of it, really, you know, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="726.92" data-end_ts="727.08" title="726.92" id=c_"726.92">__in__</span>, for some people, obviously that's zero part of it. Right, right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="730.88" data-end_ts="731.08" title="730.88" id=c_"730.88">__And__</span> some people just, just do stuff and learn how to make it happen. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>So for me, you know, obviously I, I see there's value in, in education and there's value in practical experience. But I think if you just focus only in one direction, you're not gonna, you're not gonna get all the skills that you need to, to, to really do it and, and to work for other people. You can really learn a lot by, you know, what people tell you when you're working on projects. And you can also learn a lot by what you, you know, you work for a company, maybe they don't do something the way you think it should be done. You know, that's a, that's as good a learning experience as 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Anything. That's right. Right. That's, that's something we 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="769.12" data-end_ts="769.2" title="769.12" id=c_"769.12">__Need__</span> to, this is ridiculous the way this is going. You know, like, I could have done this better if I had these tools or if I, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="775.83" data-end_ts="776.12" title="775.83" id=c_"775.83">__were__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="776.15" data-end_ts="776.44" title="776.15" id=c_"776.15">__were__</span> if I had been allowed to use this technology or whatever. And then, so, you know, you can sort of keep all those in the back of your mind. And then when it comes to doing your own project, you know, there's no one telling you how to do it. You can, you know, you can make all your own mistakes if you want, but <laugh>, you can hopefully learn from things that you've done for, for other things in the past. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So you mentioned having a, having gone to a high school where there was, an electronics lab or electronics classes mm-hmm. <affirmative> and teachers that were into it. To what extent is that the framework that you kind of built all your later work on? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Hmm. Interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>'cause, because it seems like, I mean, you didn't do the university track into getting into electronics work, so was it really that, that kind of like, set the base for you to be able to work, work from? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Hmm. Interesting. Well, I went there specifically because I, I kind of, I'd always been doing hobby projects. You, I'm sure you're familiar with the, these old books that they used to sell at Radio Shack, <laugh>, the Sam's <span style="color:red" data-ts="840.87" data-end_ts="841.16" title="840.87" id=c_"840.87">__book__</span>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="841.16" data-end_ts="841.24" title="841.16" id=c_"841.16">__Yeah__</span>. Forest m Mims, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="842.36" data-end_ts="842.56" title="842.36" id=c_"842.36">__ii__</span>. Oh yes, absolutely. I don't know anything about him actually, but his books were sort of, you know, really influential for me when I was a kid. Sure. I had ones that were even out of, out of print that someone gave me, you know, that that had amazing, you know, introductory circuits and things like that. And sort of, I, I sort of exceeded the capabilities of what like my teachers at school could, could teach me. So actually I, when I was, when I was about 13, I, I decided to get a ham radio license. 'cause I figured, that I, maybe I would learn about electronics from doing that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>So I actually did like a night school course at the local college. And I think I was like the, one of the youngest people in there, <laugh>, there was another, there was another kid whose, whose uncle did it or something, and he came as well. So there, there was only two of us, and there was all, all these older, older folks. So my mom would drop me off and, and I would go in there and then, and I took a trip to the big ham fest in Dayton and kind of had my mind blown and then realized that technology was, you know, and radio stuff and, and electronics was like, so, so amazing. And then the next year I was, I was headed to high school. And, and so I chose a school that was basically like a, like a technical school specifically, because they had this electronics program. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>And it was, it was, it was just amazing to be able to be around people like that. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="925.84" data-end_ts="926" title="925.84" id=c_"925.84">__the__</span>, the main teacher who was actually like in charge of the department, he, he had worked in, in industry for big, I don't know all the companies, I can't remember now. But he had worked in all kinds of things and he did military stuff. He had been in the army and was doing electronics there. And so he had all these crazy stories and, and you know, he, if you just said, Hey, I want to learn about this, you know, he would know about, about it or at least know enough to, to point you in the right direction. And I found that really inspiring. And so I think I, yeah, I think in terms of getting the, the groundwork in terms of, you know, all the basic theory and that kind of thing, that was really, that was really, you know, sort of solidified it for me and made me have the confidence to do, you know, more large scale projects later on. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>I mean, that was a bit too early in terms of learning all about embedded microcontrollers and things. 'cause that, that stuff was, you know, kind of came about a little later. And I taught myself, you know, pick microcontrollers and things, in university and, and then after that. But that was really, you know, it sort of set the groundwork where I, I knew what everything was called. I knew how to do all the calculations and, you know, I knew where to look for information. And in those days, it was just before the internet was really sort of taking off. And so, you know, I had a lot of magazines of different electronics things and books and stuff. I would photocopy from the library and, and stuff like that. And sort of after, you know, tons and tons of binders full of paper, like <laugh>, you know, and little jot notes and things sort of, you sort of get the, you learn the vocabulary, let's say. Right. Of how to sort of navigate that world. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well that's, that is fascinating. And, what a cool way to approach stuff, because you know, a lot of times with electronics, you find people who, are just hungry to do it. So they'll sort of slap together just enough knowledge to be able to pull off the thing that they wanted to do. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> or some, or in other cases, you'll get people who sort of had the, the 30 year grinder version of learning electronics. Sure, sure. And, and eventually kind of throw up their hands and do the thing you want. I, I think it's interesting how you kind of like made your own path through the learning process to get kind of exactly what you wanted to do. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>That's neat. You know, my biggest regret is not discovering analog synthesizers back in those days, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, right. I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Would've gotten a, I would've had, you know, been a lot, a lot further ahead, but, you know, well, maybe, or maybe things were different now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Maybe it would've gone broke, just like all 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Of it. <laugh> may, maybe, probably. But yeah, I mean, I was really interested in computer. I would do a lot of things with, like, building things that connected to the, to PCs and stuff like that. Right. And in those days, that was like, that just seemed like sort of like science fiction. Yeah. That 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Was magic. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Turning on and off lights and motors and reading sensors and, you know, before we had like flash microcontrollers easily available, it was like, you know, dedicate a PC to doing a, a stupid task just for fun. Right, right, right. And, and, you know, later on when I found microcontrollers that really kind of like, I, I realized, okay, this is really, this is the cool thing, and this is, there's so much potential there. But it, you know, it was, it was built obviously on the foundations that I got, you know, in a, in a proper, a proper, program learning about that in school. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, let's talk about your move into, into the analog synthesis world, because, I've had an opportunity to, to use several of your modules, particularly the, is it the 48 15 pattern generator mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Yep. And then the K 16 mid converter, both of which were just like, first of all, fantastic build quality and stuff. They just felt so solid, you know, thank you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b><laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And, the kind of, the kind of modules that make you feel good about, you know, just having 'em under your fingers. Cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1171.42" data-end_ts="1171.64" title="1171.42" id=c_"1171.42">__But__</span> particularly the pattern generator was one that really kind of blew my mind, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1176.66" data-end_ts="1176.88" title="1176.66" id=c_"1176.66">__huh__</span>. Because first of all, it has a very unique, sort of like, visible, almost like sculpture to it, you know, Uhhuh uhhuh with the dotted, user interface and the, I don't know, it's just, I, I just found it very intriguing and very engaging mm-hmm. <affirmative>, but also unlike anything that was around at the time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>How did you decide that the, the pattern generated, that was kind of one of your first 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Modules, right? I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1209.08" data-end_ts="1209.12" title="1209.08" id=c_"1209.08">__think__</span> was <span style="color:red" data-ts="1209.16" data-end_ts="1209.28" title="1209.16" id=c_"1209.16">__the__</span> first, yeah. Yeah. I'd done a d i y synth and which, which sort of got me thinking about all this stuff. Okay. And it just happened that, you know, at a specific point I was like, I need to do some new products. What am I gonna do? The whole guitar pedal thing wasn't really going the way I wanted. And I had actually built this thing months before I, I was, my workshop used to be literally right next door to an store, which is, which is fairly rare in my town anyway. There's only a couple shops that sell parts and things. Sure. And on the weekend, I decided that I would do, you know, formal kind of business work stuff, you know, working on my pedals and various other newer designs. I would do those in the, in the weekdays and after hours. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>And on the weekends I would just do whatever I wanted. Okay. So I was actually in this store and they had this eight by eight L e d matrix, much bigger than the one that's actually on the module. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. But I just thought, Hmm, that's interesting. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="1266.72" data-end_ts="1266.84" title="1266.72" id=c_"1266.72">__I__</span>, I bought it and within one weekend I had built this little thing in like a project box with this display, and it just <span style="color:red" data-ts="1276" data-end_ts="1276.16" title="1276" id=c_"1276">__did__</span> midi, it wasn't CV or anything. And I, I just thought, what can I do with this? And I was like, my mind was in music stuff already anyway, so I thought, what if I did something with MIDI and maybe this could do some sort of patterns or something like that. So I kind of, I kind of just got something going really quickly. I had it scanning the display and I did some, put some MIDI ports on the back, and I had a few knobs and I wasn't really even sure what they would do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>And it's, it's not the same, but it's like, you know, the same concept of how the pattern generator actually turned out was this little box. And I played with it and my friends played with it, and everyone thought it was kind of neat. And then I forgot about it for a while, <laugh>. And then when it came time to do some synth modules, I, I kind of kept wanting something that would just make notes, like, or some sort of different, you know, changing voltages while I was tweaking my synths or while I was working on some other projects. Like I was, I wanted to build another oscillator and I was doing some other things. I thought maybe I should just make that somehow into a module. And I went through a whole bunch of different ideas and kind of came up with this concept of these layers of different elements that you would, or ingredients I like to call them. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Right. That you would mix together, like, you know, a visual pattern. There's a motion, be below the whole thing is a scale. Like there's some, obviously some notes that are assigned to the various steps mm-hmm. <affirmative> and I kind of figured that would make a really interesting user interface because most of the modules that I'd seen, like I realized I couldn't start off by just making another oscillator or something. 'cause there were a lot of people doing them better than I was doing them. And I was like, Hmm, I need to do something that's kind of a good entry into this market so people will sort of be excited about something. And, and I was really interested in the control side of things. And that kind of, it kind of grew out of there. I thought, I thought maybe I can do something with this that sort of inspires people and makes unusual, you know, maybe accidents that turn out to be interesting. Like, and, and as I'm, as I was testing it, I was coming across all these riffs and things that were like, oh, I've heard that in the song before <laugh>. Or, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1412.82" data-end_ts="1413.04" title="1412.82" id=c_"1412.82">__oh__</span>, that's interesting. You know, and, and it was just like, I would just turn it on. It's, it's interesting to look at and, I, I really liked the connection between the visuals and the, and the sound, which I think, I think is part of the appeal. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I, I think you're right. Well, I think also that the pattern generated was the first, was the first device that I got a chance to use that that was generative in nature, but it did not, it wasn't random Uhhuh, <affirmative>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Uhhuh, <affirmative>. You 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Really had the sense that you were controlling the results, that you were Right. You were developing. You may, it may have been kind of a shaky connection of that control, but you just felt like, you know, like you were, you were driving the process mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And, and I thought that that was fascinating. And again, like I say, that's the first thing that I, that I had run that had that sense. And I was really curious about your development process on that because, it, it had the feel of something that was a happy mistake. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>It, it, and, and I, you know, this, this little box, this weekend project that I did sort of like, you know, its second, incarnation was, was the pattern generator. And it sort of seemed like a good place to start doing something, you know, when, when everyone's going one way. Right. I like to go the other way. Sure. Just because it's like, it's more interesting to sort of try to break new ground and, and, and to sort of not just jump on the bandwagon. You know, if I did that, I wouldn't probably be doing the kind of things that I'm doing. I'd still be in my job that I, I eventually left <laugh>. Right. You know. But, you know, it was interesting to, to sort of just take a different approach to the control side of things, because I saw there was a real disconnect there where people were making a lot of interesting music with modulars, but it was always keyboard driven. Right. In many ways. And I thought that seemed like a bit of a hindrance because there was so much more, like, there's so many more dimensions that you could control things with than just pressing and releasing keys. And especially if you want to have both your hands free to twiddle knobs. Right. It seemed like something you just, you know, turn it on and then it does something interesting. And if you get tired of it, you just, all you have to do is touch one of the controls and it can do something completely different. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's interesting that you talk about kind of going your own way, because that's a great segue into the next thing to talk about, which is the design of your own modular format. Now, while I really enjoyed working, with your URE stuff, that, that kind of floored me. I was like, you know, my first reaction was like, well, that's a ballsy move <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Right. Well, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1584.85" data-end_ts="1585.2" title="1584.85" id=c_"1584.85">__maybe__</span> a bit crazy. I don't know. It's, it's certainly, it's not this, I don't know. I'd done, I, I'd done a bunch of, well, not a bunch, a few. I, I did the pattern generator. I did the, MIDI converter. I did, dual V C O mm-hmm. <affirmative>, which was probably the most ambitious design, that I had done thus far. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's an amazing looking thing. I never got a chance to touch one because I never found one in stock. Ah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Ah, there's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1612.48" data-end_ts="1612.6" title="1612.48" id=c_"1612.48">__a__</span>, there's one more batch possible to build. It uses several chips that have recently become obsolete, unfortunately. But anyway, there's, yeah, there will be some more sometime soon. But, and then I did a sequencer because, you know, it's funny, it's like people ask for things but don't really want them sometimes. I don't know if you've ever noticed this, is that everyone thinks that something should have a certain feature. But s and this is what happened with my, the, the mo the last sort of full URAC module that I did was the, the step sequencer, which is a little sequencer with a, an amber display. And it has all these different modes. And it's, it's, I thought I was giving people exactly what they wanted in terms of people were asking with the pattern generated, well, could it record? Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>You know, could it do these things? You know, like, could it, could I program the steps and, and can I do all these various things? And, and so I tried to, I tried to offer a lot more detailed, sort of granular editing possibilities by doing this two, two track sequencer. And although, you know, the people who got it really seemed to like it, it didn't really sell in the numbers that, that the pattern generator did. And I kind of think, I know why now in hindsight, but at the time I kind of was a bit disappointed because it was a very ambitious firmware project to do all these features. Sure. And so, you know, I I, I was thinking of des New Designs for uac, and I had a whole bunch of things that I'd sort of drawn up and I kept running into this problem where everything was a bit too cramped mm-hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b><affirmative>. And one comment I got from the, about the dual oscillator, from some people was they thought it was too big. Now, I can tell you for after cranking out a lot of different revisions, it's very hard to make something good. Especially in your Iraq that, you know, and you don't want <span style="color:red" data-ts="1730.56" data-end_ts="1730.68" title="1730.56" id=c_"1730.56">__to__</span> cramp the, the front panel. It's really difficult to give the right spacing sort of human sized and have it not take up a lot of space because you only have, like, the P C B vertical width can only be like four and a quarter inches total. And that includes, you know, the borders and mounting screws and all that stuff. So, you know, I kind of got frustrated and I'd been thinking for a while, Hmm, maybe I wanna do something totally different, so that I can really feel, engaged when I'm doing a design. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>And I don't feel like I'm trying to design it to fit this tiny format with small connectors. And I personally, I don't really like mini jacks. I think <span style="color:red" data-ts="1770.1" data-end_ts="1770.32" title="1770.1" id=c_"1770.1">__the__</span> bad. Right. Yeah. So, so I sort of spent a long time probably at, you know, the detriment to my, to my finances and so on. <laugh> is <span style="color:red" data-ts="1780.64" data-end_ts="1780.84" title="1780.64" id=c_"1780.64">__that__</span>, is that I, I thought, okay, you know what, I'm just gonna stop right now and I'm gonna think about this and work on this until I have something new. And I had been thinking about all sorts of different designs and trying to, I made a list of all the things I wanted to solve with a, with a new format. And I know, you know, it's, it seems silly to like just make yet another format, but I'd done a, I'd done a version of the pattern generator for ula mm-hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b><affirmative>. So I got, I got some time to play with a ULA <span style="color:red" data-ts="1808.88" data-end_ts="1808.96" title="1808.88" id=c_"1808.88">__of__</span> 200 E system. And for you, I really liked the size of it. I liked banana jacks. There were things about it. I didn't like the way the power <span style="color:red" data-ts="1817.54" data-end_ts="1817.76" title="1817.54" id=c_"1817.54">__can__</span> connectors worked and everything. So I kind of, from an electrical and a mechanical standpoint, I was like, I had all these ideas. And I finally, I sort of figured it all out, to do this plugin format. I don't know if you've seen how the modules work. I've not in my format, but they basically just plug in with banana plugs on the bottom of the module. Oh. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1838.36" data-end_ts="1838.64" title="1838.36" id=c_"1838.36">__They__</span> plug into a chassis. There's no cables, there's no panel screws. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Interesting. It's literally a plug and play kind of system. And, it solves some electrical problems. There's a bit more standardization on the voltages. It's bigger and easier <span style="color:red" data-ts="1854.82" data-end_ts="1855.04" title="1854.82" id=c_"1854.82">__to__</span> design what I think easier to design good, good panel layouts. Right. And so I sort of just put everything into that and said, I'm not coming out of this until I have something. And realized that obviously doing something new, I had to come out with at least enough modules to make a full system. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>So I worked on five designs at the same time. Which I would not recommend anyone ever do <laugh> because I was also developing the format at the same time. So when I would come up with a design change, like of something minor, like an electrical thing, or a little mechanical thing, then I would have to go through all my designs and update everything. Right. 'cause I was working on them all in parallel. I literally ordered all the circuit boards at the same time, and it took months and months and months. I had a few false starts. Some stuff came back, didn't look the way I wanted. I changed things. I wasted a lot of time and money. And anyway, I finally, in 2012, in June, I released this new format. And although it hasn't sold very large numbers yet, the people who I've heard from, really think it's, it does a lot of things really well. And for me, it's kind of like, if I'm gonna design modules from now until eternity, right. I wanna be really happy with what I'm making. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I think, and I think that's really important because, I mean, first of all, unlike some of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1942.68" data-end_ts="1942.76" title="1942.68" id=c_"1942.68">__the__</span> other systems, you know, there, there are a lot of people who have not had the opportunity to work with banana jack systems. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, I used to have a big surge system. Okay. And I loved working with, you know, a, a system that was all Banana. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. But <span style="color:red" data-ts="1956.2" data-end_ts="1956.28" title="1956.2" id=c_"1956.2">__it__</span> was just something, first of all that everything about it seemed kind of right sized, but also like the search, that Four <span style="color:red" data-ts="1963.24" data-end_ts="1963.36" title="1963.24" id=c_"1963.24">__U__</span> Height also somehow has a right field. So you can do configurations that are like, the, the Old Mills College kind of curved systems and stuff like that. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And the width of them isn't so great that you're like having to extend your arms to work on it. It's just Exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's a very convenient height to work with, but <span style="color:red" data-ts="1988.31" data-end_ts="1988.6" title="1988.31" id=c_"1988.31">__Anex__</span> are fabulous. And I can see where it gives you more room to work. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Now my question is, well, you know, and, and you sort of, you sort of basically said you wanted it to be something that you would feel good about doing for the rest of forever. Did it, does it not? Do you get a lot of negative feedback because it's not, it doesn't easily fit into other systems? You know, I think of either a surge or a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2022.34" data-end_ts="2022.76" title="2022.34" id=c_"2022.34">__Buchla__</span> type system. Hmm. I would think that these people would, would kind of wave their arms around a lot. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>It's funny, you know, it's, it's been the, the people who seem to not, to not get it as much are the people who are sort of fully entrenched in the sort of the whole Eurorack thing. Because there's so many manufacturers, so much choice. And obviously as a consumer that that's a huge advantage. The people that like bananas seem to just like anything that's bananas, <laugh>, they're bananas for bananas. Like, I, I don't, you probably read the Muff Wiggler Forum, and yes, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2056.36" data-end_ts="2056.48" title="2056.36" id=c_"2056.36">__I__</span> do. They have these dancing banana icons. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2058.39" data-end_ts="2058.88" title="2058.39" id=c_"2058.39">__Anytime__</span> someone mentions bananas. But it's, you know, it really add anything adding to that sort of landscape, I think people are supportive of because, you know, they see maybe it's not a hundred percent compatible with their system. I think it would be pretty much compatible with Surge, although I haven't tried it. ULA has a lot of differences. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Brooklyn's got issues there, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b><laugh>. But, but yeah, I think generally people are supportive of something, that's breaking new ground and trying to do, you know, trying to just make a better user experience. My my biggest thing is I hope that more people will get on, on the bandwagon. I've released the specs for the system, so hopefully, and that was just this year because it took a long time to sort of compile all the information together and, and, you know, put all the drawings together and I, I gave away free designs for the enclosure, panel artwork, or sorry, panel, layouts and things like that. So to hope, hopefully encourage people to just jump on it and try to make some stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>So, you know, that sort of thing takes time. Obviously the people who are maybe more a bit more business savvy than me are, are, are not gonna just jump in there and just do it, because the user base is pretty small at the moment. But, I, I'm hoping in time people will, you know, once, once the hype of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2145.92" data-end_ts="2146.2" title="2145.92" id=c_"2145.92">__rack__</span> sort of settles down a little bit, I, I hope that people will maybe just think about giving it a try, as designers or, or as modular enthusiasts too, right 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now. I mean, one of the things that kind of prevents that from happening easily is, is sort of this whole first user issue. So a lot of people, you know, I'll, I'll tell you my track into the new, new version of Analog. 'cause back in the day, I had a modular system and I had an Aries system mm-hmm. <affirmative>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2182.36" data-end_ts="2182.48" title="2182.36" id=c_"2182.36">__I__</span>, I had a surge system and an Aries system. And s yeah. I, I love those, those systems, but also they were a nightmare to keep running. Right. Uhhuh, Uhhuh, <laugh>. Yeah. Falling apart constantly. With the new stuff, I kind of came at it like, well, five <span style="color:red" data-ts="2201.36" data-end_ts="2201.48" title="2201.36" id=c_"2201.36">__U__</span> stuff looks familiar, looks moish, I'm gonna give that a try. And by the way, a neighbor of mine's got one, so I could kind of take it for a test drive first, right? Sure, sure. And then, another friend introduced me to the Eurorack stuff, which at first I was like, Ooh, that seems so teensy weeny. But, you know, some of the, the, the many options that were available, kind of drew me into that. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, I have not had a chance to lay my hands on a Kilpatrick format system. And so from that standpoint, it's kind of hard for me to generate sort of the internal excitement that it would take for me to get into the format. Right. How do you, how Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>I, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>How can you break through that when you come up with something this radically new? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Hmm. It's interesting. And I've actually thought about that a lot. I'm a little bit sort of maybe not, not a hermit in the true sense of the word, but, you know, I kind of do my thing and I don't really care, you know, what's going on in the other areas so much. Not like, obviously I follow what, you know, what things are happening, but I kind of just do my own thing. And for me, you know, whether people buy it or not is kind of like, obviously I'd like to sell more because it helps to support what I'm doing. Right. But at the end of the day, honestly, I, I was more interested in just doing something that I felt really strongly about, more of a long-term project of this sort of endless series of modules that I have in my, in my, on my to-do list. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>But recently actually, I've started thinking more about, you know, oh, maybe I should go to these <span style="color:red" data-ts="2301.33" data-end_ts="2301.68" title="2301.33" id=c_"2301.33">__synth__</span> shows and do events and let people actually try stuff out because, you know, that would be great to do. It's, I think, I think there's a level of confidence that comes after having done stuff and having things out, out in the wild for a little while. Sure. That, you know, at first I was really sort of nervous about, well, you know, are people gonna like this or are they gonna have problems with stuff? And it's, you know, you can never anticipate every situation. And I think I've sort of been doing it for long enough now that I, I think I, you know, I would feel good going and showing it, you know, at some fairs and things like that. So that's, being in Canada, it's a little harder because we don't have a lot of that kind of stuff here. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>And, traveling with a big synthesizer, you know, on an airplane or something, it's maybe not my first choice of a fun thing to do. Right. But, you know, that's something I am considering, especially with this new product that I've been working on, is it's so portable that, you know, it's, it's a natural that you would just take it somewhere and show people. So, so yeah. I am trying to get it out there more so people can, can get their hands on it. One thing I've held off on, which, which, I'm considering changing in the future is, is dealers have asked about stocking it, and my biggest concern was, you know, you really need to have all the modules available so people can like, get a system right away and stuff like that mm-hmm. <affirmative> mm-hmm. <affirmative>, to sort of justify the dealer margin and stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Like there needs to be a, a real value that obviously the hands-on experience is. Yeah. But I was, I just wanted to be able to offer, all of the products all the time. That's another reason why <span style="color:red" data-ts="2402.66" data-end_ts="2402.88" title="2402.66" id=c_"2402.66">__the__</span>, the modules that are designed the way they are, and a big PO point that I forgot to mention before actually, is that they're designed so I can build them one at a time. Unlike interesting, unlike Eurorack, which I do surface mount parts, I send them away, maybe do 50 at a time or something like that. Right, right. And I started running <span style="color:red" data-ts="2420.12" data-end_ts="2420.24" title="2420.12" id=c_"2420.12">__a__</span>, running into issues when I was doing Eurorack is that new dealers would come on board and they would want to reor or like order a bunch of different things, or an existing dealer would want to reorder a whole bunch of things. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But <span style="color:red" data-ts="2432.04" data-end_ts="2432.12" title="2432.04" id=c_"2432.04">__I__</span> could never offer 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Everything. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. You almost couldn't afford to, to make the items that you needed to sell. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Exactly. So, and, and, you know, doing a production run's pretty expensive and it takes, let's say, a few months before you have stuff ready for sale. Right. So, you know, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2446.44" data-end_ts="2446.64" title="2446.44" id=c_"2446.44">__kept__</span>, kept getting frustrated and, you know, obviously building modules, I, I'm, maybe I'm speaking probably <span style="color:red" data-ts="2453.27" data-end_ts="2453.76" title="2453.27" id=c_"2453.27">__general__</span> in general terms, but I would say most people that make modules want to eventually offer a complete system. Right. Because, you know, you can have a, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2462.28" data-end_ts="2462.4" title="2462.28" id=c_"2462.28">__a__</span>, you know, you have a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2463.43" data-end_ts="2463.72" title="2463.43" id=c_"2463.43">__Bula__</span> or you have a surge. Like, I wanted people to have a Kilpatrick, why not? Right. Right. It's like putting everything I, that I know and can afford into doing this, why shouldn't they <span style="color:red" data-ts="2472.48" data-end_ts="2472.6" title="2472.48" id=c_"2472.48">__have__</span> be able to have, like a, a newer name in the, in the biz? Right. So for me, that kind of, you know, it was a, it was a stumbling block to try to figure, figure out how can I offer all these products at the same time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>So the format kind of lent itself to that. And I do the designs in such a way that, that I have a guy who helps me and I, you know, we build, let's say four at a time mm-hmm. <affirmative> because it's easier that way. Right. And I stock all the components that I need to do to do pretty much all the models, any at any time. That's really, so that was a big deal for, for being able to offer something over a long term. Yeah. Like to say, oh, I want one of these, two of these and three of these, or whatever. And to be able to actually say, yes, I can do that. So I've sort of held off on the sort of dealer sales of the system, but I'm, I'm getting to the point now, once I have I think maybe two or three more modules, I think it'll be well-rounded enough that I'll, I'll actually say, you know, go to some of the resellers in the stores and say, Hey, you know, are you guys interested in, in taking this on? I mean, I know that some of them have already asked, but I, you know, I just wanted it to be to the level where someone would come in there and try it and just be completely wowed with the amount of selection, especially if there were other manufacturers on board doing, compatible things. Right. I think it would be really, you know, then there becomes a whole infrastructure of, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2553.08" data-end_ts="2553.2" title="2553.08" id=c_"2553.08">__a__</span>, you know, a whole collection of products that you can choose from and not just what I'm able to come out with. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Right. That makes a lot of sense. And, but also it's kind of interesting to hear that that part of your thinking and how you would build these was actually to create a, a system that wasn't immediately in danger of going away. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>That's the biggest concern for me when I do any design, is how long are these chips are gonna be, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2581.92" data-end_ts="2582.12" title="2581.92" id=c_"2581.92">__or__</span> how long are these chips going to be available, or whatever it is. Usually it's chips because they have the fastest obsolescence rate of any part. Right, right, right. So, you know, that's, it's, it's a huge concern because especially with synthesizers, because there's nothing wrong with a design from like 10 or 20 years ago, but good luck building it. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Yeah. I made the mistake of, not mistake, I can't say it that way, but I made, I made the mental error of getting a whole bunch of electro notes stuff and saying, oh, I'm gonna dive in and just kind of d i y some stuff mm-hmm. <affirmative> based off of that. And an enormous number of those circuits are unbuildable because you just simply can't find the chips. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Yep. It's true. And, and, you know, I kind of got stuck. I've had this happen before where I got stuck with a part that just went obsolete after having been in production, like since the 1970s, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2637.24" data-end_ts="2637.36" title="2637.24" id=c_"2637.24">__since__</span> the 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Dawn of time. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Yeah. And, and all of a sudden just, you know, just the way the industry goes and so on, it just, now I just can't get it anymore. And so, you know, I've actually, I have some stocked up parts for, for certain modules and things that hopefully will last me for a while. But, you know, that, that's definitely something to, to, to try to, to minimize is that, you know, when you put a lot of time and money into doing a prototype and doing a really, you know, time consuming design, you wanna be able to offer it for a while. So, you know, that was part of it as well, is to not sort of get a bunch of orders and go to do a run. And then like inevitably every time you build something, there's something you have to substitute just because it's not even, it's gone. It's just maybe not in stock for 12 weeks or something. Yeah. <laugh>. Right. So, you know, it's, this is, it's, it's part of the unfortunate business of electronics is, is the industry moves really fast. And unfortunately, the music side of things, there's a lot of advantages we can draw <span style="color:red" data-ts="2697.26" data-end_ts="2697.48" title="2697.26" id=c_"2697.26">__on__</span> cool parts and technologies from other areas, but special purpose things made for music are few and far between these days. I'm, I'm sorry to say. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>There's that. And also, way back when he got started, grant Richter in developing his wired system mm-hmm. <affirmative>, kept on running into one problem, which was so much of the electronics industry is oriented towards massive quantities. It's almost like the concept of building cell phones Yep. Just flipped the electronics industry on its head and said, well now unless you're talking about quantity a hundred thousand, I don't even know how we can help you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Exactly. It's a, it's, it's a challenge. You know, that's, that's part of the challenge. I think that any, anyone in any electronics related field, is, is facing as a newcomer into the business. It's like, especially in synthesizers where you want to use a, there's usually a lot of different types of components on the same circuit board mm-hmm. <affirmative>, because it's not just a purely, you know, digital design. There's a lot of, there's amps and voltage regulators and, you know, specific control panel parts that you want them to feel a certain way and stuff like that. It's quantity. Yeah. That's a, it's a big deal. That's, that's another reason why I decided to build stuff as I go is because I share a lot of the components between different designs. Sure. So when I buy banana jacks, let's say, I don't just buy enough for whatever people order, I buy, you know, a hundred at a time or 200 at a time. Right. So to try to get those, those price breaks, but unfortunately it means that I have to keep them in, in my own inventory, which costs money. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>So, you know, there's, there's no real easy way about it. It's, it's, you know, if you're doing larger quantities and you can do them in big batches and you can afford to do that, well then that's great. But, you know, not, not everyone has the, the means or the, or the, you know, the risks, that wants to take those kind of risks to do that. Right. <laugh>, it's not even about affording it. It's like, okay, go <span style="color:red" data-ts="2822.92" data-end_ts="2823.24" title="2822.92" id=c_"2822.92">__borrow__</span>, borrow a bunch of money, and now you've got boxes full of boards that are tying up your credit line and stuff like that. So having been there, I feel much more at ease when I'm not working on in that, in that way, which is sort of where why I ended up doing it the way I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2838" data-end_ts="2838.12" title="2838" id=c_"2838">__am__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That makes a lot of sense. Now let's talk about this newest device that was just announced. It's funny because I reached out to you about doing an interview and then mm-hmm. <affirmative> like a couple days later. I see the, announcement of the soon to be <span style="color:red" data-ts="2855.2" data-end_ts="2855.52" title="2855.2" id=c_"2855.2">__coming__</span> phenol. Is that Uhhuh 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b><affirmative>. Phenol, yep. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, phenol. Which first of all looks beautiful. Oh, thank you. And second of all, actually kind of in some interesting way, looks like almost the next generation of your Kilpatrick format stuff just mm-hmm. <affirmative> put behind a set panel. Exactly. Tell us a little bit about what this is, first of all, and and then secondly what the design, goal is with this versus the modules. Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Well, I think that the biggest question that I, I get from people is how much does it cost? Especially for people who aren't really people who are into modular synths. I think that they, you know, I think that takes a certain amount of, you know, deep pockets to, to want to and be able to afford to do that. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, and I think people start to expect things to cost a certain amount and so on. But, you know, I talk to a lot of people who really love synths and really love, analog, you know, patchable synths and so on, but they're not in the position for whatever reason to, you know, shell out thousands and thousands of dollars. Right. I kind of felt badly about that. I kind of felt like I was, you know, as much as I want to offer high quality modules, you know, built, you know, to high specs and so on, I kind of felt a little bit guilty as well that, you know, am I making things that are like not accessible? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>So I started thinking about what could I do that would bring this sort of modular concept to as many people as possible? And I kind of, by a strange turn of events, I ended up working on this design kind of by accident. It was one of these things, it's like what we talked about before about the pattern generator. I, I had an accident, in the summer and I had a broken wrist. And, I was trying to do some projects just to keep myself occupied. You know, in the, in the spare time I wasn't soldering 'cause I only had one hand available mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And, and I started doing things like trying to figure out what can I do that's not gonna drive me crazy with this, you know, short-term disability, I guess. Right. I, I was still working coding all day at, at in the daytime. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>And I, I was, I don't work there anymore by the way. I was doing, I was working for a Kai and audio for a while doing like firmware basically. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3001.32" data-end_ts="3001.52" title="3001.32" id=c_"3001.32">__Oh__</span>. It got very, it got very monotonous. So I don't do that anymore. But, I was trying to do something that would, you know, free up my, my bad hand to just relax. So the natural thing is using cad, because you can do most of it with the mouse. Right, right. So I started just drawing up some ideas and I kind of thought, you know, I wanted a big enough project that would keep me busy for a little while, <laugh>. So I started just putting down some ideas and I, I have this system of designing where I design everything in my electronics, software. Okay. Which is Eagle, by the way. Right. And I actually have special components that I made so that I can actually lay out the panel at the same time as the board. So I don't actually design products in a different program anymore. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Interesting. So I can actually see how the whole panel's gonna look. And also when I'm done it, all the control panel parts are actually on the board where they need to go. Right. So I can actually, it's really easy to move things around and, and I use a special layer that doesn't get sent to the circuit board making Right people. So I actually just started messing around and trying to figure out what could I, you know, could I fit something? I was thinking about a sequencer for a while, and then I thought, no, you know what, it would be interesting to see how, how much could I bring the price point down of all these individual circuits in one box? That was the real thought behind it because, I don't know, you've built electronics, you probably know that the actual circuit components are not really the expensive part, <laugh>. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. It's the sheet metal and 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>It's all Yeah, it's all <span style="color:red" data-ts="3100.76" data-end_ts="3100.84" title="3100.76" id=c_"3100.76">__the__</span> stuff 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Surrounding <span style="color:red" data-ts="3101.44" data-end_ts="3101.48" title="3101.44" id=c_"3101.44">__it__</span>. Connectors, knobs and that stuff. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Yeah. Power supplies. Yeah. You know, all the, the, you know, enclosure, bits, all that stuff. So I thought, you know what, I think I could probably, it's like a little bit more bang for, for the buck to basically try to put a lot of these things into a single unit, but still make it really patchable as a regular modular synth. So I started working on a sort of stripped down designs. They're not designed to be like worse necessarily <laugh>, but you know, they're designed to obviously be more efficient in terms of panel space. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> parts count. I don't use any weird chips. Right. So, you know, it's a little bit more commodity components and, and try to see could I do a viable synth patchable synth using the same connectors and voltages and everything that, that I use on my, my, Kirkpatrick format modular. Could I put it in one box and sell it at a price that, you know, if someone were wanting to get into synthesis that they could hopefully afford. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. So you're teasing us right there. When you're, when you say that, what is the dollar figure you're thinking of in your head? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Less than a thousand dollars for sure. Okay. The retail price I just announced the other day, for now I'm hoping to get it even lower. But someday <laugh> for now, 8 49. Wow. Is the number. Okay. Now, so I'm looking at starter systems because a lot of people are like, oh, I want to get started. I think I'll just buy like one of these small starter systems, eurorack systems. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, you know, usually they come with a little mini synth voice module or something like that. Maybe a few of the utility modules and a little power supply and things like that. There's a few different offerings at the moment. None of them really were, were something that I would feel like I would wanna recommend to a friend because I know that they would outgrow it really fast. Right. And as soon as they wanted to, to do anything more, they wouldn't want those anymore. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So it ends up being they end up replacing their entire first system. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Exactly. And so it seems like sort of throwaway kind of money. Right. And there's not a lot of resale value <span style="color:red" data-ts="3231.82" data-end_ts="3232.04" title="3231.82" id=c_"3231.82">__and__</span> think for something that's like super entry level either. So, you know, I, it doesn't seem like a good investment. So what I thought of is I thought, well, you know, it has to be good enough. Maybe getting rid of the modular concept helps to save some costs because I know that enclosures and power supplies and rails and all that stuff are really expensive. No matter which way I've, I've sliced it several times trying to make lower and lower cost euro rack stuff. And I've, I've, I've done a project with a friend recently in that area to try to make an even lower cost way to get into your rack. Right. No matter which way you do it, it's still expensive. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>So I thought maybe I need, just need to not do any of that and just make a standard desktop, you know, two sheet metal parts. There's only like a small number of fasteners that hold the thing together. It feels solid, but it's not, you know, it's not, doesn't have a ton of hardware. It's not all sorts of different parts fitting together and chassis and things. Separate pieces inside. There's one circuit board and the circuitry on the bottom and the control stuff is on the top and, you know, it's a little bit more integrated. So you can actually design stuff like that because you can fit things in between sections and stuff like that. It's a bit more of a challenging layout, but what you end up with is you end up with the bare minimum necessary to make something that's decent and it's gonna work really well. Right. So that's, that's sort of, that was sort of a, it was more of like an like, just an exercise to see could I pull it off? Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So you need to, you need to put out some more, images of it so we can start drooling over the front panel mm-hmm. <affirmative> because the one that's out there is kind of at an angle in awe <span style="color:red" data-ts="3337.12" data-end_ts="3337.24" title="3337.12" id=c_"3337.12">__I__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3337.24" data-end_ts="3337.28" title="3337.24" id=c_"3337.24">__can__</span> do is guess. Right. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b><laugh>, I did do, I did publish an actual like, like a two D drawing of like a panel layout. 'cause a lot of people were asking me, what are all the trolls and everything. Sure. It's not a hundred percent the same as like this is still a prototype. Right. But it's like, let's say it's like 98% as as, as it will be. Yeah. But yeah, I'll take some more photographs of it. Cool. I think, I think the response has been absolutely insane. I've never in, you know, in the four years or so that I've been doing synthesizer stuff, I've never had so much interest in anything. It's like all the other things combined. I would say <laugh>, it's, it's, it seems to speak to people in a way that like, maybe it's just, it's, I don't know. It's the price plus it. I think it's, people told me that they don't feel intimidated by it as they would with a big modular system. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and if you think about it, there's, there's actually a fairly long history of what we would call semi modular systems mm-hmm. <affirmative> or Patchable systems going all the way back to everybody's heart throb, the 2,600. Sure. Of course. Or 2,600. Yep. But, you know, the, the Phoenix systems Yep. The MS systems mm-hmm. <affirmative>, all those things, were, were like beloved by the, the people that had them mm-hmm. <affirmative> because it seemed to tread between, the complexity of a modular system, but sort of the, the friendliness of an all <span style="color:red" data-ts="3427.28" data-end_ts="3427.44" title="3427.28" id=c_"3427.28">__in__</span> one piece thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>I think so. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>There's another thing though that's really interesting about this and interesting about the concept of a semi modular or a patchable system, which is because it's a set set of features mm-hmm. <affirmative>, it means that people that use them have a shared, a shared vocabulary. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Yes. That's a big 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Deal. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3450.08" data-end_ts="3450.2" title="3450.08" id=c_"3450.08">__Yeah__</span>. Shared way to talk about their patch creation and, the development of, of things. And, and that strikes me as really important. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Well, something I've been thinking of doing, and I haven't really figured out the best way of implementing it yet, is I wanna start a section of my site where people can submit their patch ideas mm-hmm. <affirmative> some sort of, I don't know whether it's like these like sort of scribble sheets where people can write down things or they can take a photo of their, of their setup with their patch and then upload it or something and describe it a little bit, or show different tips and, and tricks. I mean, maybe forums can sort of handle that, but I'd like sort of a more publicly facing way of sort of like, you know, sort of a, a dictionary, I guess. Oh, yeah. For ideas. Because I think the, I think the shared experience is something, I didn't think of it like that, the, the way you described it, but I, I like the way you, you described that because, you know, I've often thought of that in terms of, you know, if you wanna have your own unique experience in modular, well all you have to do is go out and buy all sorts of different eurorack stuff, <laugh>, and you're probably not gonna have the same system that somebody else has 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Or anyone else for that 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Or anyone else has, which is, I think that's kind of cool, but it's also not cool if you want to sort of like trade ideas with your friend because maybe they don't have the same modules that you have and so on. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Right. Well, I think it's, I think it's a brilliant idea and I wasn't sure <span style="color:red" data-ts="3541.08" data-end_ts="3541.32" title="3541.08" id=c_"3541.08">__what__</span> your price point is, but at what you're talking about that's really, really stunning. Now this is gonna all be compatible then with the Kilpatrick format mm-hmm. <affirmative>. So people who wanted to expand could then expand from this into that. Right? Mm-hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b><affirmative>, I almost see it like, like a dockable laptop or something. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>It's like if you wanna take the essence of a patchable syn synth and take it to a gig, put it alongside maybe some sort of, you know, more pre-programmed type of synth Right. Then this is cool, but if you want to use it in your studio, it adds more functionality to maybe a larger system. Right. I've had a lot of people ask about compatibility with other systems, Uhhuh <affirmative>. I haven't really decided what I, if I can offer something else, to make that easier. But, you know, the voltages are similar enough that, you know, you can probably make or get some eurorack, or sorry, mini jack two banana kind of cables. Right. And go between different things as well. And, and one good thing that, you probably know this, but a lot of people won't know this about bananas, is that it's probably the, the simplest way to do your own projects if people <span style="color:red" data-ts="3613.73" data-end_ts="3614.08" title="3613.73" id=c_"3613.73">__wanna__</span> get into D I Y because you can put a little project box together with a funny circuit or something that you came up with on a, you know, in an evening probably, and it will look really good and you can just patch it right in. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>You know, it's <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well it's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Sort of lab lab centric, you know. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It is. Well, the other thing I always liked about banana jacks is that they sort of could always double as a probe, right. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Exactly. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So you could just like start sticking it in random circuits and uhhuh or whatever. And as long as you know, you're not going to over <span style="color:red" data-ts="3649.16" data-end_ts="3649.48" title="3649.16" id=c_"3649.16">__voltage__</span> anything Sure. You can all of a sudden sort of, it, it's sort of like automagically doing circuit bending as part of your modular system. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Yeah. I have a, I I went to my friend's studio the other day so he could try it out. And we did some, we shot some video of, for some demos and stuff, and he had this whole, like, he was using the clock divider and he was holding the three plugs in his hand and he was alternating touching them to to, to another one, Uhhuh <laugh>, to get different polyrhythms going. Right. And I was like, oh, neat. Okay. He made his own switchbox, which, you know, why not Right. <laugh>. Right, exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="3686.06" data-end_ts="3686.28" title="3686.06" id=c_"3686.06">__And__</span>, and you know, when I designed circuits now, I mean, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="3688.72" data-end_ts="3689" title="3688.72" id=c_"3688.72">__used__</span> the things that I've built before as sort of like part of my test bench really.

Right. And, you know, clip alligator clips onto things and whatever. And you know, that's a really great way to just try out ideas without having to have a full circuit finished. Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3712.08" data-end_ts="3712.2" title="3712.08" id=c_"3712.08">__'cause__</span> you know, if you <span style="color:red" data-ts="3712.72" data-end_ts="3712.92" title="3712.72" id=c_"3712.72">__wanna__</span> make a cool filter, well you need a sound source. Or if you wanna make some sequencer, maybe you need a clock or something like that. So I, I really, I really hope that people that maybe this will open more people up into the sort of like hacker maker thing to start thinking about, you know, not <span style="color:red" data-ts="3729.58" data-end_ts="3729.8" title="3729.58" id=c_"3729.58">__ma__</span> maybe making full huge synths from scratch. 'cause I can tell you it takes a while and <laugh>, but, you know, to start, start learning about how some of the stuff works and build their own <span style="color:red" data-ts="3740.33" data-end_ts="3740.68" title="3740.33" id=c_"3740.33">__front__</span> plans or just come up with ideas, I, I really think that's a, you know, that's an untapped thing that, that, you know, a small community of people are doing. Right. But I think there's a lot more potential for people to really get into it <span style="color:red" data-ts="3753.22" data-end_ts="3753.44" title="3753.22" id=c_"3753.22">__in__</span>, in that level. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and I think it's kind of interesting, this is gonna be the first really like financially approachable banana system. Mm. And I think that people when they, when they get the opportunity to work with banana jacks and sort of like the built-in multiplying system, multi system that comes with it, but also the simplicity of connection and, connection to the outside world mm-hmm. <affirmative>, I think it's gonna really open some people's eyes and maybe kind of, create a little more desire in the entire, banana based system as well. I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Really hope so. Yeah. Because I mean, I have a lot of respect for the surge designs, but like the cost and Yeah. You know, I've just, I've, I've never had the opportunity to use a system, but I, I really think that those designs are, are great and, you know, they kind of look like d i y a little bit <laugh> and that, you know, they're all sort of little mental ideas that, that have been put all together in, into a system, which is, you know, I I, I must say that it, you know, that is partly an inspiration <span style="color:red" data-ts="3825.08" data-end_ts="3825.24" title="3825.08" id=c_"3825.08">__for__</span> what I'm trying to do as well. But I really like the idea that you could come up with a lot of different parts and then put them into something that you call an instrument. Right. Because I think that there's more to it than just choosing the correct modules. Especially if you're new, you might not know what to choose and you feel like maybe you've always made the wrong choice because you can't make your system do what you think you could make it do or whatever. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and there's, I mean, this concept of an instrument is actually a really powerful thing. And it's one of the places where sometimes muff wiggler can kind of distract you or point you in the wrong direction because you jump into the eurorack module section, let's say, and you'll be like, oh, everyone talks about the make noise, math, maths. And a whole bunch of people were talking about the Borg filter and a bunch of people were talking about, this other oscillator. And those are obviously the best things. And when you pull 'em all together, they maybe don't sound sound so hot because they, you know, the, the kind of range of activity on a knob on this device, Uhhuh <affirmative> doesn't really match the range of activity of a mo knob on another module. And all of a sudden it doesn't have the sense, the, the sense of cohesive design mm-hmm. <affirmative> that makes you feel like you're playing an instrument. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3906.24" data-end_ts="3906.44" title="3906.24" id=c_"3906.24">__you__</span> know what, that's, that reminded me of something, which is probably why I ended up in the whole modular thing. Instead of doing things like controllers for computer and stuff like that. And I bought some of these sort of generic U s B controllers and I thought, wow, this is great. This is like so flexible. But as I started trying to pair them with like software on the computer, I realized that like I <span style="color:red" data-ts="3929.12" data-end_ts="3929.28" title="3929.12" id=c_"3929.12">__would__</span>, I'm gonna have to take a step back and really like figure out how I wanted to design this interface. And if I don't already know all the functionality or, or how to use it, I'm totally unqualified to do that <laugh>. Right. You know what I mean? Right. So, so like, I need someone else to show me, which is why I think certain products, like the push and things like that are successful is because they've sort of said, you know, we understand the software 'cause we made it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>We, we think these are the kind of functions that would be really useful to have. And that's kind of, I think <span style="color:red" data-ts="3962.28" data-end_ts="3962.48" title="3962.28" id=c_"3962.28">__that__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3962.48" data-end_ts="3962.68" title="3962.48" id=c_"3962.48">__and__</span> Machine is a good example. Well, right. Where they really, there's a marriage between the software and the hardware in a way that the, the, the designers who really know that intricate details are the ones putting it together. And I, I sort of see that, you know, obviously the modular thing is super flexible. Obviously it works on a per module basis, but I think there's something to be said for doing it on a, on on an entire system basis as well, which is why I think the surge is really interesting. Right. And, and a lot of the other semi modulars where, you know, the designer gives you all the parts that he or she thinks you'll need to get something really interesting happening and hopefully, you know, it speaks your language, let's say, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Yeah. And I think, I think much like, you know, in the guitar world, some people are really drawn to a Les Paul and other people are really drawn to Stratocaster. Sure. Some people are gonna be drawn to the decisions that, that Rex is making on a search system, while other people are really drawn to ULAs design methodologies. Right. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>There's no one right answer, you know, it's, it's different strokes for different folks. Right, right. But, but I really think it's, I think a designer can give and it makes me feel like I can give a lot more sort of spending a lot of time figuring out what are all the parts, how could they go together, what's an interesting layout that sort of encourages people to explore things in a specific way, you know? And those are all those, you know, I'm not saying that I'm the world's expert on, on user interface design, but you know, you start, you, you, you find things out as you're trying to put the pieces together and you start to learn from using other things to how you, how you're gonna assemble all these parts and, and what features even to offer, which is interesting. That was a real big, big deal for me doing phenol, was while I have this much space, I sort of chose the size based on like, what's the size of like a larger laptop. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Right. That was my sort of goal. I wanted to fit in a backpack, which means not rag mountable because that's too wide and you can't get the zippers done up at the top. I've tried that. <span style="color:red" data-ts="4089.36" data-end_ts="4089.56" title="4089.36" id=c_"4089.36">__Right__</span>, right. Taking effects processors to gigs and stuff. So it's like, you know, it has to be that size. Okay. It's gonna be about for you. 'cause that's kinda like the size I like to work in vertically. What can I, what can I give people and how do I divide it up so that it's clean and so that people can find their way around, you know? And, and that's, it's, there's a lot of decisions that go into there and, you know, some people come along and say, well, I would move this here and I wanna do this this way. <laugh>. It's honestly, it's, you know, there a lot of people, people say this, I don't know if it's a meme or something. It's like, it's because of reasons. This is the <span style="color:red" data-ts="4125.64" data-end_ts="4125.76" title="4125.64" id=c_"4125.64">__way__</span> it's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b><laugh>, it's like, I don't, I don't have the time to explain them all to you. And I probably forgotten some of them, but there were reasons at the time that I did it. That is the reason why it's the way it is. So, you know, so I hope that you like it <laugh>, you know, I take all comments into consideration, but, you know, sometimes, you know, there, it turns out the way it is, it's, it's, you know, it's a, it's it's art as much as design in some ways. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Absolutely. Well boy, burned through that time in a hurry. <laugh>, it's fa fascinating discussion. One last question. Sure. When, when are we likely to see the phenol, available to the public? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Okay. So this is a little different than what I've done before in that it's a bit more ambitious in terms of a prototype and build. So I have to do it in quantity, which means I have to sort of sell some, I'm gonna work on a Kickstarter campaign Okay. Which should be active hopefully soon. I'm just trying to finish all the, like, the video and all the stuff that you have to prepare for that. Sure. So I'm gonna take orders probably starting, well, let's say early to mid-December. Okay. At the very latest. And I think I'm going to sort of promise by June of 2015 that it'll be like in people's hands kind of a thing. If I can get it sooner than that, that would be awesome. Right. But you know, there's, there is still more work to do and, it's a larger, undertaking than, than than a module. So I don't wanna let every let anyone be disappointed. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that sounds really interesting. And I, I actually really appreciate sort of like the honesty of saying, you know, this, this takes time and this is going to, you know, this, this needs to be done. Right. I mean, one, one of the things I think people look at if they, they look at the history of the work that you've done is you're pretty dedicated to doing things right. So I, I can appreciate that perspective and, dang, this looks like a really exciting system. So I'm anxious to get my little fingers on <laugh> <span style="color:red" data-ts="4250.08" data-end_ts="4250.24" title="4250.08" id=c_"4250.08">__on__</span> this thing as well. <laugh>, I might have to come up to your neck of the woods and, take your, take your, your, prototype for, test drive 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>For sure. Anytime. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I want to thank you very much for your time again. Man, it was fascinating, hearing, hearing you discuss so openly how you go through the design process, because I think that that ends up being a thing, thing that so often looks like either, I mean, frankly, it either looks like, it either looks like black magic or it looks like bullshit and you can't ever know for sure which of the two it is. It's, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>It's hard to, it's hard to know. I mean, you know, I, I treat everything as a serious project regardless of whether it's, you know, my full-time job or it's something I'm doing for fun. You know, I can't do like weekend projects very easily anymore because I always wanna do the full design path. Right, right. Through everything. But yeah, no, it's, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="4306.88" data-end_ts="4307" title="4306.88" id=c_"4306.88">__I__</span>, I wanna make sure that I, I, I make, I make it as good as I can because, you know, people are spending money on it and I want them to enjoy it. That's really what it comes down to. I want people to enjoy the work that I do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I really appreciate the, the efforts that you're putting into it and, I hope that everyone gets a chance to, to lay their hands on some of your work because I think it's fantastic. So with that, I want to say thank you again and, have a great evening. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Great. Thank you very much. Alright, bye bye now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thanks a lot to Andrew for joining us for the podcast. It was an awesome interview. Very friendly guy for being a self-described hermit. Seemed like he was totally comfortable talking to people. Thank you so much for listening again this week. Get a chance to check out what Andrew's doing with his Kickstarter program, and check out some of the modules that he's put together as well. Other than that, I want to thank you for listening and, hope that you'll catch us next week. Bye.
