<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, today I am going to have the pleasure of getting to know somebody right in front of you. It's someone I've actually met quite some time ago at a, at a max workshop. Her name is Anna Wisely, and she has got, I think, an interesting story to tell. And she certainly has done some really interesting work. Anna, was kind of reintroduced to me by Gregory Taylor who, said you really ought to talk to her. And so I'm taking the opportunity to do that. Exactly that. Hi Anna, how are you today? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anna Weisling: </b>I'm doing well. Thanks so much for having me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. And thanks a lot for, being part of the podcast. It's really, great to have you. So why don't we start off by having you explain a little bit about what it is that you're, your current work looks like. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anna: </b>Sure. Well, I'm currently a newly a PhD candidate at, Georgia Tech, just in my second semester now. And I'm in their, digital media department. But I have to say that my own work kind of spans a couple different areas, really between audio and visual work, both in, performative and engineering context, which, you know, a little bit about my past and my path here. So it's kind of taken some interesting turns, between those two worlds, I think. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Let's talk a little bit, right to start off with, because it's an area I'm curious about. And, and when I kind of looked into your work and your background, I got, I got kind of excited 'cause I love talking to people about the journey that they take in order to kind of find where they land. And in your case, I see an awful lot of work in, in a lot of study in the area of sonic recording technology, sonic arts, that kind of thing. But you're now currently doing a lot of visual work, it looks like. Is that true? Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anna: </b>Absolutely. I, I think that there's, there's been some interesting very distinct trajectories that are either very audio focused. I, I worked at a recording studio for a number of years, for example, but my personal practice has been mostly visual, video work. So my research has, has gone in a lot of, of different ways, but I'm currently kind of, I'm interested in, in this audio visual contract, this, this relationship between audio and, and visuals that seems to kinda become popular in these phases. And I think now that computing has kind of caught up to where, where more experimental computer music was like 50 years ago, in terms of processing power, people are really, kind of getting back into this idea of what can we do with visuals, live and what might visual music look like and, and what might that relationship be? So I'm very interested in my own practice in, in looking at visuals as a performance tool in the same way that you might look at a musical instrument and kind of navigating, you know, what that that looks like in terms of expression and collaborative engagements. And, and I've been really lucky to work with some great people that, I think you and I both both know pretty well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Before we get too much further, what I would like, one of the things I like doing in my podcast is talking to people about their background and how they got to be the artists that they are. Now, in your case, we're probably gonna dive into it a little bit deeper because I am curious about the track that you've taken to get where you are. But I'm, I'm kind of curious, how did you first get started in audio? How did you, expand into video? Or maybe it went the opposite way, but how did you get to be the artist that you did? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anna: </b>Yeah. Well, I'm, I'm from a little town in Wisconsin called New <span style="color:red" data-ts="254.585" data-end_ts="255.005" title="254.585" id=c_"254.585">__GLADiS__</span>, which, no one would have any cause to know of unless you are really into beer, which I am. Right. <laugh> or you're super Swiss, which I'm not <laugh>. And thank God for that brewery because really there's, not much else to do there. So I, I grew up in a place that wasn't really at the forefront of, anything including theater and sound and video and technology. And, so I didn't have a whole lot to do. So it's kind of as much a surprise to me as anyone that, that I ended up where I am now. But I think it can all really be traced back to that very, universal, it seems idea of being in a band. And man, I just wanted to be in a band who doesn't wanna be in a band, unfortunately, I can't sing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anna: </b>And I wasn't very good at playing instruments. I tended to learn just enough to be passable and then jump to another instrument more than any band teacher should have. Let me, it was pretty ridiculous. It was like clarinet to oboe to French horn <span style="color:red" data-ts="327.245" data-end_ts="327.445" title="327.245" id=c_"327.245">__to__</span> trumpet, you know, totally nonsensical. I think I was just more interested in the experience of engaging with an instrument rather than mastering one. And honestly, I, I don't, I think I was pretty honest with myself. I wasn't ever gonna develop the chops to, you know, go pro. So I hopped around with, instruments a lot and, and never really stuck with it. But by the time I got to college at UW Whitewater, I was lucky enough to study with, Jeff Harriet, who's the composer. I'm <span style="color:red" data-ts="362.085" data-end_ts="362.125" title="362.085" id=c_"362.085">__not__</span>, I don't know if you know him. Yeah, I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Do actually. Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anna: </b>Yeah. And, and for some reason he, he just one day walked in, I was, I was an audio tech at the time, and he said, Hey, I'm doing this show and you should look into this thing called Jitter. 'cause we could use some like, visuals for it. And I said, you know, bring up Google, look at Jitter. Yeah. All right. It's got a free demo, so <laugh>, I'll give it a shot. And, you know, 10 years later, I'm still working with the guy <span style="color:red" data-ts="393.905" data-end_ts="394.125" title="393.905" id=c_"393.905">__and__</span> guy. He's still letting me ride his coattails. So, yeah, it's, it's been kind of a, a weird wild ride. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, I'll tell you, I, it sounded to me like there was a lot of glossing over in that bio. So <laugh>, somehow you went from a person that jumped from oboe to trumpet to being an audio tech in Whitewater. And then beyond how did you get into audio technology? What was it about wanting to be in a band and playing a bunch of instruments that led you into audio tech? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anna: </b>Right. That's, yeah, I guess I did jump over a few details there. I think that the way I found myself engaging with the process and with the sound and the experience, rather than, honing my skills in on one particular instrument, really reflected something about me in that I have an ear, and I love the idea of music, and I love the idea of being a musician, but that just, you know, didn't end up being my path. That wasn't my strong suit. Right. Being a, a proper musician, but what it did lead me to was using the studio as my instrument. So, you know, it's, it was a way to have my hand in that musical experience that I yearned for without having to be good at an instrument. It's a different skillset. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It is. But I, i, it really resonates with me and, from a number of different standpoints. I know for myself, I, I sort of did the hop around of instrument thing a little bit, and a lot of times it was because I just really loved experiencing the, the timur changes of different things. But I, I too, I had a kind of peculiar ear as a kid. I grew up also in a small town of, in Wisconsin. How did you run across your first recording gear? How is it that you just, I mean, again, not something that you're gonna find on the street corner, so you had to stumble on it somehow. What was your stumbling process? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anna: </b>Yeah. Well, UW Whitewater for all, its kind of small town issues, actually has a pretty terrific, I don't know if it's a recording program per se, but they have a great, radio station and they have a little, kind of studio set up with, with the soundboard. I don't know what they have in there now, but one of my other professors, Brian Lucas, he would open the opportunity to any of his students to join him on recording sessions that he did, because he's, a great musician. He, he plays harmonica and a lot of blues bands, and it's just wildly talented and a great person overall. And, you know, I took my first recording class with him, and when he put out that offer, I was, I was there, you know, that was like right chance to go record a band with my teacher, seemed how, why would you not do that? So I, I recorded with him, a fight fake Irish band. The, and I mean that in, in just the most, endearing way possible. But yeah, it was, it was tons of fun. And you can imagine what a fake Irish band recording studio session might look like. Right. It was exactly that. So I've kind of fell in love with it from there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's, that's phenomenal. That's, that's a great story. From seeing this and interacting this, did you end up then sort of taking an academic approach at the recording studio? Or was it more like it was there and you started working in it and, and you kind of bootstrapped yourself? Which, which approach did you take? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anna: </b>It was definitely, just more kind of boots on the ground, getting to learn the lay of the land, the terminology, just, you know, the whole technique and, and just the culture. And by the time I'd applied for a few internships, when I was getting ready to graduate, and actually I, I went to Smart Studio, which is unfortunately now closed. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But, I interviewed with Mike Z at the time, and he, he was so, so great. I don't think they had an opening, but he agreed to meet with me anyway. And one of my questions for him was something along the lines of, if you could give one piece of advice to a student about to graduate, who wants to go into recording, what would that be? And he thought really deeply about it, and you could tell that he, this was coming from his heart when he said, change majors <laugh>. And I said, oh, well, thanks. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Not what I was shooting for, but 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anna: </b>Might be a little late for that, but thank you for your time. As luck would have it, I actually got an internship at Audio for the Arts, which was just right up the street, and he now works there, so. Oh, interesting. <span style="color:red" data-ts="711.965" data-end_ts="712.165" title="711.965" id=c_"711.965">__When__</span> it comes full circle in some ways. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Indeed. Well, that's, that's cool. In that, in that process, I think that there are a lot of people, their first taste, you know, especially if they go to school for some form of recording arts or, music technology kind of stuff, they end up in that first internship. And it seems like people tend to come out of that internship with one of two things. Either an abiding love for it, or this foreboding sense that, oh my God, this is not for me. <laugh>. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> my assumption is you came out of it feeling pretty good. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anna: </b>Yeah, it was, oh, it was heartbreaking to leave the, the guys that run the place, Steve Cher and, and and Buzz Kemper are just amazing people, amazing engineers, and it, it became like family for me. So it was really difficult for me to make the decision to leave. But, you know, on that same token, I, I knew that, Mike <span style="color:red" data-ts="773.285" data-end_ts="773.525" title="773.285" id=c_"773.285">__Circle__</span> had really hit on something when he said change majors, because it is increasingly difficult, as I'm sure you know, to make a career out of something like audio engineering, especially if you want, you know, healthcare or vacation 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Days or an income at all. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anna: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. After having grown up kind of in this rural southern Wisconsin and going to school, you ended up taking on a master's program in Belfast, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anna: </b>I did, yeah. Master of Sonic Arts. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That seems like a crazy leap other than your connection with fake Irish bands. <laugh>, I'm having a trouble imagining that, you know, the idea that's like, yeah. You know, I feel Belfast coming on. What was, what was the transition that led to that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anna: </b>Yeah, that's funny. 'cause Oh, boy, you couldn't pay me to go back to Belfast now, <laugh>, it's, it was a rough year. You're right, it was a, it was a leap. But truth is, I loved academia for one, partially because I was so fortunate to be surrounded by people like Jeff Harriet and Brian Lucas, who, you know, as my mentors and teachers, really just embraced me and gave me every opportunity they saw that could possibly benefit me. So I had this fabulous relationship with academia at the time, which would soon dissolve into just a rainy, cold year in Ireland <laugh>. But, and the second thing was that, you know, it was, it was a sonic arts program. I'm not a musician, I'm not a composer, a visualist who happened to work at a recording studio, and they seemed totally okay with that. And I thought, why not? You know, if they think I might have a place here, it's a year. And I, I think it could be good for me. I might might totally fail, but I might really learn something. And I think the truth was somewhere in between. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, sure. As maybe often happens now, by this time, had you already started making waves, with your visuals? Or were you still kind of just dipping a toe in 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anna: </b>Making waves? Wow. Have I, have I done that? That, I don't know. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It would be great to me. I, I would say that you have, but maybe that's just because, you know, I, I look at your work and, and to me there's, there's maturity to it, which a lot of times maturity and visual work comes from doing it over a long period of time. Right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And so maybe making waves wasn't a great phrase. Maybe just, I don't know, what do you call it when you put your attention on an, on a method of art making, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> whatever, whatever that word is. Do you feel like you were well on your way into that by the time you went to Belfast? Or were you still kind of trying to decide audio visual? Which way do I go? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anna: </b>Yeah. I wish, I wish actually that I had been thinking more in terms of, of, you know, which one, when I made that decision to go, because it was a strange navigation when I got there, between, you know, do I take, composition with Eric Lyon or do I take, you know, but to, to get to your real question, I think by the time I was getting ready to go to Belfast, I had had a, a good few years working with Bell Monks, which was Jeff Harriet's Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, sleepy, sleepy Rock band, and the Weather Duo, which was this, kind of experimental duo, cellist and bassist. And I think I had worked with him for maybe three or four years by then, as their, you know, honorary fifth or third member doing live visuals. So, I don't know that my work had necessarily matured, but I had certainly found a foothold in that world. And, you know, kind of started forming my own idea of what I wanted to do as a personal practice. So, so I had some comfort in the idea of being a live visualist by the time I was heading to Belfast. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The Belmont's work is really interesting because the music itself is pretty haunting, and then your visuals seem to like really echo that sense in a, in a kind of a very peculiar way. And, it's hard for me to actually put my finger on it because it's not kind of typically what you think of as visuals for songs, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So that was stuff that you'd been doing prior to even going to Belfast, is that what you're telling me? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anna: </b>Yeah. So, so yeah, the Belmonts is an interesting project that, that's ongoing actually. Though I'm not really a part of it anymore. I think what happened with that was, was that as, as you know, they've got this really kinda dense, heavy, thoughtful, sleepy sound. Right. That I think lent itself a little bit, I guess to, cinematics isn't the right term, but there's this kinda cinematic feel to it at times. And it's also though kind of heady. Like my mom doesn't go to Belmont's shows. She's just, it's not her jam, but it's kind of, it's not the easiest thing to sit through because you have to really embrace the space that they create. And so the video for them really reflected, I think that the textures they were developing and reinforced their form and movement that they were developing. But, you know, there was never a narrative, which if you've listened to the lyrics, would've been pretty impossible. I don't know how I could do wingspans and constellations <span style="color:red" data-ts="1128.745" data-end_ts="1128.965" title="1128.745" id=c_"1128.745">__of__</span> drifting among the stars. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, I hear you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anna: </b>So it's, so, it's not a music that's easy to experience, and I think that layering some of that light, like visual light on top of it made, made it a little more accessible maybe. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, one of the things that, that to me too, I, I thought was interesting is, and, and maybe this is why it spoke to me after watching the video on with the music, it was hard for me to imagine hearing the audio without that visual. Oh, interesting. You know, it was, it was like they were melded in a really important way. And I think that that's hard, but that's also really that there is one of these kind of things to talk about as being like a maturity of work that I just really appreciated. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anna: </b>Well, that's quite <span style="color:red" data-ts="1176.265" data-end_ts="1176.485" title="1176.265" id=c_"1176.265">__the__</span> compliment. I appreciate that it's, you know, there's this balance that I think is hard to strike between, you know, are you making a music video or are you doing sound a soundtrack to image or is it something else? Right. And I think we did try to make it something else at varying levels of success, but it was, you know, we were trying to embrace that live kind of back and forth dynamic where we were really contributing to each other. Although I think, you know, I was accompanying them a little more than they were me, but I Yeah, I'm glad to hear that, that it was, a successful kind of melding of two media. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I, I thought it was fantastic. And so, now that leads us then, so you, leave the rainy and cold world of Belfast. When did you, when did you finish up there? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anna: </b>So I started in 2011, finished in 2012. And actually, that same year, bell Monks released, a track a month for a year for which I was responsible for, creating a video. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So I was, I was spending a lot of that year on the, you know, 15th, 25th of each month, <laugh> getting a rough track and, you know, frantically going to archive.org and just trying to scrape something together and put out a, a video for them. So that was an interesting element of that whole experience 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Sure. So, then in between, you did some, you worked for a variety of places and now you have taken on a PhD track at Georgia Tech, right? Is that correct? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anna: </b>Yeah, yeah. I did some teaching in between and kind of, amazingly ended up at Julliard for a year right. Before, just as their music technology specialist glorified it help desk person, Uhhuh 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative>. How did that feel? What was it like to be at Julliard 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anna: </b>Bizarre? Yeah, I was, I was actually interviewing for that position over Skype. 'cause I was still in London at the time, and I don't know, I'd kind of bounced around a bit and when I got that call I was like, wait, Julliard, Julliard, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, is there another one like in Kansas somewhere? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anna: </b>Hey, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1323.885" data-end_ts="1324.045" title="1323.885" id=c_"1323.885">__it__</span> has two eyes. I don't think the real one has two eyes, but it does. In fact, I have two eyes. So it was bizarre. It, the whole thing was bizarre. It's still bizarre to me. But, yeah, that's where I ended up for a year. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's crazy. So what did you, what did you actually do there? You call yourself glorified it, but 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anna: </b>Yeah, I, well, it, it honestly was a lot of it, help desk issues, particularly with, classroom technology and just, you know, there's, there's an interesting dynamic, that you probably would find at any conservatory that, you know, what, what is the purpose of a conservatory? It's to put out, the most talented musicians in the world. And that is sometimes at odds with the idea of experimentation and technology and, you know, whether or not you're, you're gonna prepare students for the real world or the idealized world. And so there was a lot of, you know, my VHS player in my classroom is not working, my turntable is not hooked up. Right. My cassette player is being janky. It, it was a lot of just kind of outdated media issues, because, you know, they teachers there are the best in the world and they have their collection of LPs and that's what they're gonna keep using until Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anna: </b>Until someone replaces 'em. So that, that was the reality of it. They did have a lab and, they have some music technology courses, but it's a very small part of what they do, I think, unfortunately. So, you know, I, if, if the role had been then to support the more, experimental practices that they pursue at times, I think I, I might still be there, but unfortunately for me at least, it was, it really was more just a maintenance role and, you know, how do we support what is currently being used rather than how do we best support, a new music practice. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That's actually interesting though, because I never really, maybe it's, it's because I've never really given a lot of thought to what a school like Julliard must actually be, but I've never really thought about this idea of making virtuosos to play in a concert hall is sort of at odds with the, naval gazing world of experimentalists. But it totally is. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anna: </b>Yeah, absolutely. And I mean, even one of my coworkers had, had been a student there 30 years ago, and he would tell me about their, you weren't allowed to practice jazz in their practice rooms. Like it was forbidden. And, you know, that's at the same time that we're now supporting their jazz department. So it just moves at a different pace and in a different kind of parallel universe, I think, to a lot of what I was familiar with. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So it'll be really interesting in 2060 when they open up their DJ lab. Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anna: </b>Oh yeah. That'd be great. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So now you're at, at Georgia Tech, and, again, when I kind of look at your list of work and stuff, one of the see things that seems like you've always kind of vectored in on is things that involve, like tangible interaction with the, with media. You did, some kind of a table top tangible interfaces. I think you did a paper on interacting with, I, I can't remember the name of it and I'm not looking at it right now, but, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anna: </b>Yeah, yeah. I, I know what you're referring to. Yeah, you're, you're exactly right. I, I've definitely been focusing in the last maybe five or so years on, tangibles for the, the sheer fact that I guess my practice with live visuals is developed to a point where what I'm interested in is, performing musically and expressively. And as I'm sure you know, the laptop, although it facilitates all these wonderful new ways of engaging with media, it's a screen that you look at, and very often that you, you know, click number boxes to manipulate, particularly within jitter, which is my main, tool. And, you know, you can hook up a, a MIDI box to that, but for visuals, then you're working in this like, incredibly musical paradigm that just doesn't quite gel. So, so that's all really to say that I wanna make stuff that can take me away from my computer and allow me to look into the faces of the people I'm working with on a stage, rather than diverting my attention from number box to screen to cellist to dancer, or to screen to number box. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's actually really kind of interesting point because I don't feel like anybody has done a great job of developing a user interface that really is focused or makes sense for Visualists because there's nothing else. There's always the disconnect between where your hands are and where your eyes have to be. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anna: </b>Yeah. And I mean, it's reasonable enough. I, there are so many parallels you can make between the visuals and sound, and certainly people over the years have, you can map pitch to color and amplitude to brightness and all of these things. But, you know, if you wanna take visuals as, as a tool and really be expressive with them, then you need to decide what are the parameters that I need to express what I wanna express? Are they universal parameters? Are these notable parameters? If I build an instrument, you know, what do I need to control, and, and how do I communicate with the other people on stage? It's not quite as easy as, oh, all these people are, you know, making guitar, hybrid thein, whatever we controllers for sound. I'll just take one of those and use it with video. 'cause there are mappings, but that they don't necessarily come out on equal footing, if that makes sense. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, it sure does. Now, my, my question then, what I want to jump right to is this idea of mappings, because I'm always fascinated by how people approach the concept of mapping. If you're gonna be connecting with the work that you're providing visuals for, and now we've jumped from your background directly into your performance p practice. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But if, when you talk about doing, interacting with people who, you know, your visuals are gonna be working with other people doing their artwork, there has to be some kind of connection. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And sometimes it can be sensed connection, like you say, like amplitude becomes brightness or, you know, the more high frequencies I get, the more red the color gets or whatever. Right. And those are sort of like first, first generation connections. Right. Or you might even choose to say, well, I'm going to listen and when I hear it bright, I'm gonna turn up the reds because, you know, then it's sensed by me. And, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1809.665" data-end_ts="1809.885" title="1809.665" id=c_"1809.665">__and__</span> that actually is a nice indirection. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But your work looks to me like it, it is a much, there are many more indirect mappings or maybe you just have a lot of mappings and that, and that ramps up the complexity. Right. What are the things that you look for as really sort of rich mappings, rich mappings that work for you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anna: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah. I mean, you can certainly, if I go back to my patches from early bell monks, it's, you know, it's like cable salad that you put into presentation mode to like hide your shame and stuff it down the memory hole and just pretend that you were much better and don't look at the mess. It's, it's a, it's just a lot of mappings and objects connected to gates, connected to switches, and there's nothing wrong with that of course. But, you know, there are arguments for connections down to, like we were saying, frequency and hue and pixel and sine wave. Or you can kind of zoom out and go really broad like, narrative or movement or sentiment. There's no real shortage of ways to map things, but, you know, that runs the gamut of kind of so connected that no one has any autonomy and you're just this iTunes visualizer or, you know, you're so disconnected that it becomes kind of meaningless. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Or it's, or it's just robotic. It, it's just you set up a bunch of sensors and now, the robots have taken, taken on the task. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anna: </b>Yeah, absolutely. So, so I think I'm, I'm just more interested in, really these kind of shared performative capabilities and, and how, how to facilitate an expressive collaboration and kind of co-construct moment by moment the trajectory of a piece. And this is all obviously really dependent on the person I'm working with. And I think it's almost as much about who my collaborators are, as much as it is what content I'm working with or what mappings I'm doing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. One of the things that I find one of the most enjoyable artistic practices of mine is working with a dance company. And, and one of the reasons that it's so, it's so enjoyable is, or it's, it's so fulfilling, is that I work with them as a collaborator rather than as a visual artist. So what happens is they bring me in during early rehearsals and we look at stuff and I'll do something, you know, I'll, I'll quickly patch up some, some ideas and that'll like light up some ideas for them and they start doing movements based on this concept. And it's this sort of like, you know, dogs chasing each other tails thing that ends up sort of producing for me very satisfying result. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Do you do that kind of thing where you're working really at the working as a collaborator in that way? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anna: </b>Well, not with dancers 'cause they be crazy <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, there is that 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anna: </b>I, I've worked with some dancers and it's been, great. It is a, you know, you, you wanna feel like you have some shared vocabulary and unfortunately that comes a lot easier to me with musicians than dancers. But I have had some great experiences with, with dancers. Yeah, the collaborative process is definitely a huge factor. And I mean, I can look at the piece that I made for Premier Me <span style="color:red" data-ts="2040.725" data-end_ts="2040.845" title="2040.725" id=c_"2040.725">__at__</span> a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2040.965" data-end_ts="2041.125" title="2040.965" id=c_"2040.965">__nine__</span> a couple years ago that was by far the most kind of emotional, intimate, personal piece I'd ever worked on and spent, you know, like two years developing. And it was coming out of just a very, very, difficult time. And <laugh> it was this like, massive failure. It just did not work at all, for multitude of reasons. And, and then I look at, you know, another piece I did recently with like a, it's a flashlight and a webcam, and I sit down and I play with a flashlight and a webcam, and it's incredibly successful. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anna: </b>It's incredibly satisfying. And the only thing I can really identify that are different about those things is that one is, very kind of rigid and structured and overwrought, and one is very open and dependent on the context of the performance and who I'm performing with. And it depends on this ability to kind of be in the moment. And, you know, there's no, there's no measuring that kind of, magic that can happen when two people get on a stage and you really can't, you can't write that into a piece, you know, just has to be there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, I'll tell you, you just broke my heart with that story because I thought it was gonna go a different way. I thought you were gonna say that you worked for two years on this intimate and, you know, focused piece and that it was such a cathartic moment and you were so glad you put the effort into that. And I was gonna say, you're making me wanna do that too. And now you said it was a colossal failure and I'm like, well, I'm never gonna do that. Ever 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anna: </b><laugh> it, it was, well, you know, I don't know. I've, it was a failure for me. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2156.625" data-end_ts="2156.845" title="2156.625" id=c_"2156.625">__Oh__</span>, wow. And, you know, luckily it <span style="color:red" data-ts="2158.605" data-end_ts="2158.805" title="2158.605" id=c_"2158.605">__was__</span>, it involved this like really lovely little glass box full of sand and stones and I have that glass box in a Gator case and I shoved it under my desk and I haven't opened it since <laugh>. So it has been cathartic. I got to like, close the box, put it away, and be done with it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's one of the real upsides of making tangible interfaces is that you have something to throw in a dumpster when you're done. Right. Hey, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anna: </b>They're, they're flammable 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. That's awesome. Oh, man. Well, we're sort of getting to the end of, of our time. I really appreciate you taking time outta your schedule to, to talk with me. A couple of final questions. First of all, of all the work that you've done to this point, what do you think is the, the best work that you've done? So that's different than saying what's the most successful or Yeah. What got the most rise out of people, but I would say <span style="color:red" data-ts="2215.505" data-end_ts="2215.725" title="2215.505" id=c_"2215.505">__for__</span> of your work, 'cause it's, I I'm always interested in hearing how people think of their own work, so I'm curious about that for you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anna: </b>Well, so to completely backtrack and completely contradict myself, that piece, that was a total failure. It's always gonna have this kind of place for me that, you know, I, I worked on it in complete isolation and really put myself into it. So even if it was a failure, it really is, representative of who I was at the time and, and a whole lot of other, you know, emotional baggage stuff. But it was also the first time that I had created a physical, interface that was built to do specific things. But by navigating it and using it and playing with it, it would produce these unexpected kind of glitches, these outcomes that I hadn't, programmed into it or expected from it. And I feel like that was this kind of, turning point for me where I wasn't just making a, a MIDI controller Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anna: </b><affirmative>, I was making an instrument that behaves, in its own way and, and sometimes in would fight back or, you know, it was, it was just kind of this more robust, it had this depth that I felt really like I was playing an instrument of my own creation and that was wildly different from any anything else I'd built before. So I certainly considered, that part of it a great success and I'm very pleased to have had that kind of breakthrough in my, personal work and it makes me wanna do more things that are more successful. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure, sure. What was the name of that work? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anna: </b>That piece was called I'll Beyond the Water, and I actually played it with Luke Debois in New York once. Oh, okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Is is that, do you have like a, a video of that on your site? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anna: </b>Yeah, on my site or on, I think it's on my YouTube page too. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, cool. So I'll put links for that up on the, on the page for the, for the podcast. But, because I want people to experience some of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2353.525" data-end_ts="2353.605" title="2353.525" id=c_"2353.525">__your__</span> work, I find it really pretty compelling. It's really nice, nice stuff. So, secondly, my second question is, given all the stuff that you've done, why do you feel the need to, to, attack a PhD? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anna: </b>Well, that, that is, I should put you in touch with my mom. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm not trying to be your mom, <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anna: </b><laugh> just saying No, she's, she's incredibly supportive. You know, I think that really goes back to the people in my life that I've, you know, resonated the most with. They've always kind of found me exactly when I needed them. And they've always been, academics, really. I mean, even Greg Taylor, who I consider a dear friend, although he was never a teacher of mine, you cannot have an an academic conversation with him. Right. Just try. Right. And so, so I think that academia with, for all of its flaws has really provides a, a unique experience that allows you to, not only pursue what you wanna do, but be involved with other people and, and kind of jump into their world and be involved in what they wanna do. And that can be incredibly powerful and influential. And, and as I've, you know, gone on and on about, I've worked on some projects that I just, you know, never dreamed I would have the opportunity to work on because I was simply running in those circles. So, you know, I I, I'm gonna ride this train until they kick me off, I guess. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Okay. Well that's fair enough. And now for kind of my final shot, I'm gonna go back to something that, that you asked someone during your internship, which was <laugh>. What is, what is your advice or what is your suggestion for someone who wants to, wants to emulate, emulate some of your life, they want to explore sound, explore visuals, and explore that interaction and, and be a media, media art explorer. How, what advice would you give them? And hopefully it's something maybe a little deeper than change majors, but maybe not <laugh>. But I'm curious to hear how you would respond to that now that you've gone a lot farther down the road since those days. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anna: </b>Yeah, I don't even have to think very hard on that one. It's the exact advice that, Jeff Harriet gave me when, when I was starting kind of down my road and asked him for advice and he just said, keep making stuff, just keep making stuff. And, you know, it was this kind of non-judgmental, I, I'm not invested in this. You could be any person. You just gotta keep making stuff. And I've continued to kind of remind myself of that when I hit roadblocks. And it's absolutely true. You know, as, as long as you're, you're making stuff that you believe in or care about, you can't fail. I mean, you can have failures, but ultimately you're not gonna fail. 'cause you know, you just keep making stuff. And that's a success in and of itself, I think. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that is fantastic advice and, something that I have to continuously remind myself of. And now today's talk is another good reminder. Thank you so much for your time <span style="color:red" data-ts="2573.585" data-end_ts="2573.805" title="2573.585" id=c_"2573.585">__and__</span> I really appreciate it. Couple of quick notes. Where would you like people to go to see your work? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anna: </b>Yeah, my website is a ling, that's my last name, dot com. And I, I just wanna thank you as well. It's an incredible honor to, to speak with you. And I, I find your work very inspirational and I'm not just saying that. So, it's been a great joy to talk to you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Great. And so then with that, we will say, say goodbyes and hope to get a chance to talk to you again soon. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anna: </b>Yeah, absolutely. Thanks. Alright. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thank you. Bye 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anna: </b>Bye.
</p>
