<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today I have the great pleasure of getting a chance to talk to Todd Barton Todd and I have kind of like circled the same sons for, quite some time. And in fact, we, continue to share a lot of interests. But, Todd is also really in, into some, kind of deep work, particularly with where I know him mostly from is his work with some of the, more adventurous synth systems like the <span style="color:red" data-ts="40.025" data-end_ts="40.445" title="40.025" id=c_"40.025">__Bookla__</span> and the Zike systems. He is a teacher, he's a performer. He does a lot of different things. Rather than me talk about it, we'll talk to Todd himself. Hey Todd, how are you doing this morning? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd Barton: </b>Great. Darwin, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thank you so much for taking the, time outta your schedule to have a chat. I really appreciate it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Well, it's my pleasure and honor. Yeah. So thank you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, let's start off by having you kind of talk about what your work is. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Yeah. I mostly, these days I'm doing Skype tutorials to help people understand the mindset of buchla synthesis, dyke synthesis and surge synthesis. My background is, is deeply rooted in both buchla and <span style="color:red" data-ts="84.005" data-end_ts="84.355" title="84.005" id=c_"84.005">__surge__</span> and, I'm just endlessly curious about sound have been since a little <span style="color:red" data-ts="90.915" data-end_ts="91.115" title="90.915" id=c_"90.915">__whip__</span> whipper <span style="color:red" data-ts="91.595" data-end_ts="92.035" title="91.595" id=c_"91.595">__snapper__</span>. And so as I daily spend time exploring sound, I'd like to share that via YouTube or Instagram or, as I say, some Skype lessons with, various people around the world. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. How does, how does it work to do <span style="color:red" data-ts="108.195" data-end_ts="108.475" title="108.195" id=c_"108.195">__Skype__</span>, Skype lessons? I've heard other people talk about it, but it seems like it would be kind of difficult, especially when you're working with a device that kind of exudes physicality as much as a <inaudible> system. Right. How does, how do you actually accomplish that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>We both use the cameras on Skype, and so often, we will just explore one module and the client will have their camera trained on their module, and I'll have my camera trained on my module, and we'll actually patch in real time. That's one way of doing it. Another way is, is to send them, a patch ahead of time and have them explore it and basically, you know, show me their homework. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Right, right. It seems really intriguing and it's, it's yet another one of those, scenarios where I think the internet opens up so many things that, you know, when, when I was growing up, it's like if you didn't have someone that was into synthesizers that lived in your town Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> you might go a long time before you really understood anything about 'em at all. Now the ability to take, to have access to someone like yourself to, you know, throw ideas against and to get inspired by, it's pretty, that's pretty amazing. Now, you've done, you've been doing some performances lately too, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Yes. I was in Europe in, October, the end of September and most of October, doing workshops in Rome. I did a two day workshop on, <span style="color:red" data-ts="195.205" data-end_ts="195.765" title="195.205" id=c_"195.205">__bookless__</span> synthesizers and, gave a concert there and then also in Vienna and Berlin, but that was on surge, random source surge systems Mm. And brief little talks. And then on the West coast, Portland, Stockton, and Seattle was, actually Portland, Seattle was my easel, sort of my go-to, live performance. And then my very first hordy performance was at the University of Pacific Conservatory in Stockton, California, where a friend of mine and, I co-teach with him via Skype, an electronic music course, and he has a hordy system, and I had brought mine. And so that was a fun maiden voyage for live performance on the dyke. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Boy, that seems like an adventurous, run <laugh> <laugh> because, you know, every in interaction I've had, think frankly, everybody else that that uses 'em too. You tend to be drawn into the, like, chaotic behavior of, hordy system. But that also seems like that might be a bit of a high wire act in a live performance setting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b><laugh>. Absolutely. I mean, it's, you, walk on stage and, the train's already moving and you just grab on and hold <laugh> <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Try drive it where it's gonna take you. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b><laugh>. Yeah. So what I, my motto for all my live improvisation is follow the sound. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, that's good. Now, I'm curious because, because of the kind of systems you focus on, again, they they tend to be, very classically oriented, but also very, very experimental. Right. And your sound, while experimental is also also kind of embraces beauty in a, in a kind of interesting and wonderful way. I'm wondering, what is your background and, and what is your, both your musical background and your interaction with these systems that puts you in the place that you're at right now? What, what got you to be the artist that you are 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b><laugh>? That's a great question. And, I mean, okay, we could spend hours, but the, the short story is I had a teacher in third grade, so when I was eight years old, that, a music teacher and he took a bunch of us into a little room and said, how, you know, I'm gonna teach you composition the age of eight. And, first thing we had to do was go to see a movie and remember the theme, and then write it down. <laugh> Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And he, we said, Mr. Pendleton, we, we can't write music. And he said, just, just draw it. So we came with these little graphic scores in the fifties, and he put, I remember he put my graphic score on the chalkboard, and then he said, yeah, this is a short note. This is long note. This has a tail. This note's stronger, and this one's weaker. So we put a bar line there, and before I knew it, he put five stave lines on there and turned my little artwork into music. And so I've been visually and viscerally connected to music ever since. And, thank him Daily <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Wow. That's an incredible story. What a, what an inspirational thing to do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Yeah. He, he, he was amazing, especially for, you know, third grade and, and a little suburb of, the Bay Area. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So when did you first come in contact with electronic music instruments? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>The middle of the 1970s up in Portland. I was by that point, had been working at the Shakespeare Festival for about five years. My other life is that of a, early musician. I played baroque trumpet, recorder, sham, lots of renaissance and baroque in wind instruments. And I was performing in Portland. And I met this fellow who, turns out he was an electronic musician and was starting to get into tunings and temperaments, and was gravitating towards, Renaissance and medieval music. And his name was Doug <span style="color:red" data-ts="448.725" data-end_ts="449.075" title="448.725" id=c_"448.725">__Leady__</span>. And <laugh>, it turns out, you know, he had already put in electronic music studios in, Venezuela and uc, <span style="color:red" data-ts="457.875" data-end_ts="458.155" title="457.875" id=c_"457.875">__LA__</span> and, was a good friend of Donald's <span style="color:red" data-ts="461.575" data-end_ts="461.995" title="461.575" id=c_"461.575">__hoopla__</span>. And, I remember I was staying with him for a long weekend, and on a Friday, he said he had a bunch of stuff to do, but he handed me, an easel that, a <span style="color:red" data-ts="472.635" data-end_ts="472.995" title="472.635" id=c_"472.635">__bookla__</span> easel that Don had given him Uhhuh <affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>So this <span style="color:red" data-ts="474.835" data-end_ts="474.915" title="474.835" id=c_"474.835">__is__</span> like 1975. Okay. And, I went upstairs into the little apartment and didn't come out for three days <laugh>, and there was no manual and there was headphones and, a lot of sliders. And I just, was fascinated. It was like, what fascinated me just backing up a bit with early music were all the different tams, from pure to really harsh tams, like a crumb horn or something like that. And, also just the Tamil shifts you can get with, instruments like oboes and, and string instruments, because in, in those, early music performance, they weren't using a lot of vibrato. So the thing of most interest was how to subtly change the tams. So what I found with easel is, oh, man, I can either subtly or dramatic change the tams with these sliders. So, that hooked me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>And of course, I couldn't afford <laugh> music easel in 1975. I don't think very many people could. And there weren't that many around. But then, when I came back to Ashland, I started hearing about the surge system and that it was the people's synth, and it, it didn't cost an arm and leg. So I saved up, by my day job was composing music for the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, which I did for 40 years. But at this point, you know, I'd been doing it for five, six years, and I saved up money and, contacted Serge, and he was in the Haight Ashbury at the time. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, and ordered a synthesizer, took out a little loan on my house, and, had this beautiful three <span style="color:red" data-ts="588.055" data-end_ts="588.405" title="588.055" id=c_"588.055">__panel__</span>, system that I got in 1979. And, once again, there was no manual <laugh>. I did grab, Alan Strange's book, but you know, in retrospect I realized he was talking about <inaudible> and he 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Was, was Rich, was Rich Gold's book not out yet. Then 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>It, it came out just after I got it. Ah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>But it's, yeah, it's, it's basically that, it's that system, that three <span style="color:red" data-ts="615.885" data-end_ts="616.165" title="615.885" id=c_"615.885">__panel__</span> system, right? Yeah. So, that, that was a godsend, but like for the first, I dunno, few months, it was just like plugging and hope <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>For hours on end. Right. And so I used that quite a bit, both, in some of the scores I did at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, but, radio dramas were really big. And I, I did some work with David Osman of Fire Sign Theater. He created a science fiction series for NPR called The Curve of Wonder. Okay. And so I produced a lot of music using that surge. And also out of LA there was a thing called National Science Fiction Radio Theater, which was <span style="color:red" data-ts="660.525" data-end_ts="660.645" title="660.525" id=c_"660.525">__a__</span>, a fun little, group. And I would send music down music and sound effects for, for them. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So that seems like actually kind of a big leap going from creating sort of like, early music for a Shakespearean festival to doing science fiction tunes <laugh> for an la for an LA group. How did you, how did you make that leap? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Well, I had a friend, from college who was working with the, the group in la and he, and they were looking for somebody, and he knew I was deep into synthesizers there. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> even in the, like late seventies, early eighties. And then also for science fiction, the local radio station here in Ashland, Oregon brought, a science fiction writer down for like a symposium, Ursula <span style="color:red" data-ts="716.075" data-end_ts="716.365" title="716.075" id=c_"716.075">__Lagu__</span>. And, I, I read all her books by the time, you know, I got to meet her in person at this symposium. And it turns out while we were talking, the head of the radio station said, well, can we option your one radio drama that I know is hiding somewhere? And Ursula said, sure. And, I immediately said, can I do the music uhhuh? And, she said, well, you know, do put, put something together. And so I put something together and drove up to Portland and got out my little cassette and played my demo reel, and she loved it. And, we've been working together ever since 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, so That's, that's fantastic. What a, what a great story. Well, and the other thing is, I would say that most people that are electronic music would consider such a thing to be like the ultimate possible working experience. Right. <laugh>, what could be better than making up sounds. Now, to what extent did you feel like you had to sort of follow the sonic footprint of classical science fiction, you know, the sounds and stuff like that? And to what extent did you feel free to explore the edges? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>I felt completely free to explore the edges and, you know, in national science fiction theater, it <span style="color:red" data-ts="801.075" data-end_ts="801.235" title="801.075" id=c_"801.075">__wa__</span> it was sort of a send up. So sometimes I would definitely use that for exactly the parody <laugh>. Right. But, otherwise, I was free to, you know, create what I was learning about the sounds as I was, you know, learning the synthesizer. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Boy, I've got like a million questions already, but I'm gonna just, I'm gonna kind of take 'em in order. I scratched them down here. You, you mentioned a little bit about the, the changing <span style="color:red" data-ts="828.895" data-end_ts="829.315" title="828.895" id=c_"828.895">__tamras__</span> being an important, you know, something that the transition from doing early music type work to synthesis kind of like was a, was a entree for you. Right. What other influences, or what other ideas were you able to take from both composing and playing early music that were, were still viable and useful when you were working with, early electronic music? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Aha. That's a good question. As John Cage said, I, such a good question. I'd hate to ruin it with an answer. <laugh>. Once again, the subtleties, <span style="color:red" data-ts="868.455" data-end_ts="868.675" title="868.455" id=c_"868.455">__it__</span>, for instance, in early music, often, you know, with a violin or even a wind instrument, early music performance practice that I, I grew up with, vibrato was a ornament. It wasn't used continuously as in opera or, or many forms of, of more modern music. So, using vibrato, to slowly change the timur or the impulse of a sound, in early music, of course translated perfectly over into using LFOs and, and changing, you know, sending LFOs to <span style="color:red" data-ts="911.955" data-end_ts="912.245" title="911.955" id=c_"911.955">__Timr__</span> or to Amplitude, <span style="color:red" data-ts="915.025" data-end_ts="915.245" title="915.025" id=c_"915.025">__in__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="915.345" data-end_ts="915.565" title="915.345" id=c_"915.345">__our__</span> subtle pitch. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So there were things like that, that, that were definitely useful or, <span style="color:red" data-ts="923.025" data-end_ts="923.245" title="923.025" id=c_"923.025">__or__</span> translated without even thinking about <laugh>. Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative>. Now one thing I I don't know that much about early music. To what extent was the nature of the instrument station itself changing at that time? I mean, such that there's kind of a correlation with the ever new orientation of electronic music. Was, was the instrument station really set, or was the music sort of set up to be playable by what whoever or whatever showed up? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Yes, absolutely. Baroque printed music would say, you know, here's a trio sonata, and it can be played by either a violin or a oboe or recorder or flute on top. And, you can use a small organ or a harpsichord or, for the continual part. And you can either have a bassoon or a cello or viola gamba playing the bass part. So the timur, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="981.105" data-end_ts="981.325" title="981.105" id=c_"981.105">__by__</span> who bought the music and what instruments they had would be different than somebody 50 miles away that had a different set of instruments, but could play the same music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Interesting. Well, now, as a composer, then, what do you do with composition that kind of gives it that <span style="color:red" data-ts="998.805" data-end_ts="999.005" title="998.805" id=c_"998.805">__life__</span>? Because I mean, as you're explaining it, I'm visualizing what this would look like, and then realizing that right now I would have trouble transferring my composition to someone 50 miles away because there's not really any adequate way of representing it on paper or so it seems Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b><affirmative>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Do you have a, do you do anything yourself in your practice? Or have you seen things that tend to work for that kind of documentation? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Well, no, <laugh>. Okay. I mean, I'm used to reading graphic scores, but of course those are so totally open and, I ha and frankly, I've not been interested in creating a score that then somebody else could play, and it would have the same energy, but different tams or the same sculpture, but different tams. Right. I think that's what you're getting at. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, it is, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>You know, it's like with the inception of electronic music and, you know, tape recording in the fifties, the, our medium became tape <laugh>. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. It's like, if, if I want it repeated the same way, then I would've committed to tape or today, of course, you know, to digital. Digital. Right. Recording. And then the sort of fun part, however, you know, this reminds me a lot of what like Curtis Rhodes is doing, which is he will have a piece, one of his most recent's called then, but he will remix it for cassette. In fact, he and I, I'm on a cassette with him. One side is him <laugh> doing, using analog sources, but digitally taking it all over the place with then, and my side is the improvisation on easel. But with, but he performed then with 48 speakers in Berlin, you know, by just live diffusion. So it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1118.325" data-end_ts="1118.445" title="1118.325" id=c_"1118.325">__a__</span>, it's a set tape, it's the same tape, but he can make it sound so completely different by bouncing it in so many different directions and at different speeds. I mean, you can spin the sound through speakers to the point of amplitude modulation, which Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, which adds a whole new dimension to the experience. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>So that's the closest thing I know of, of, you know, take a, a set tape and then diffuse it 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Interesting. Very interesting. So, you know, then talking about like, the graphic score, I mean, it's interesting that you, you suggest that, because my first reaction is like, oh, well, it's too bad that we're going to be missing out on a lot of music in the future because it doesn't have any way of scoring. And then I stop and I think about something like, Pauline Oliver's, almost like poetic scores, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And then it's like, well, how, how did we lose anything by moving in that direction? I mean, that stuff is beautiful. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And so maybe I need to just like, let go of the, kind of the tyranny of the written note or something. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b><laugh>, yeah, I'd recommend that <laugh>. Okay. <laugh>, it took me, it took me a long time to give it up because of course, I taught in, in universities and, and I was deep into having my students read scores and learn learn scores, which I still think is a great idea and which I love doing. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But, with the 21st century. And, it's, it's a whole nother ball game. I mean, there's so much music being produced by, and great music by people that don't quote read scores. Right. You know, and, you know, my kids are, my grandkids are, you know, playing with, these snap circuits and building strange little electric sound machines, <laugh> Yeah. And exploring those. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, I hear you. I mean, the, the future of what music making devices even look like is, is kind of, kind of interesting to imagine. So now you, you mentioned a couple of different systems that you work with. You, you know, you've, you've got this background with both <span style="color:red" data-ts="1258.285" data-end_ts="1258.525" title="1258.285" id=c_"1258.285">__Brooklyn__</span> Surge, you mentioned the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1260.285" data-end_ts="1260.485" title="1260.285" id=c_"1260.285">__<inaudible>__</span> being kind of a go-to performance synth, but that you also did some stuff using the random source version of the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1268.175" data-end_ts="1268.525" title="1268.175" id=c_"1268.175">__surge__</span>, devices. I know, you know, the, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1272.575" data-end_ts="1272.925" title="1272.575" id=c_"1272.575">__Hoick__</span> thing, Hordy thing, you've been, you know, he even points to your work as being kind of like a, an inspiration both to him and hopefully to his customers. And also you have kind of some background with that, hacking continuum, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Oh, yes. Yeah, I do 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. So you have, you have kind of like gotten all the way around the block with all of this stuff of, of it all. If you had to, if you were like, put in the corner and not let out until you revealed, what would you say is your favorite thing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Oh, man, that's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1309.385" data-end_ts="1309.545" title="1309.385" id=c_"1309.385">__probably__</span> a hard one. Sorry. Well, it, it changes of course, this week, <laugh>, right? If I was on a desert island, and just got one, it would probably be the Hordy Uhhuh. But that's, you know, I hear myself saying that and go, yeah, but, but, but, but wait, no. I want my <span style="color:red" data-ts="1327.615" data-end_ts="1327.905" title="1327.615" id=c_"1327.615">__Bula__</span> and I want my surge, <laugh>. So. Sure. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So in addition to these, in, in addition to all these instruments though, I mean, the one thing that that is a, a truism about electronic music studios is that there's no such thing as a, as a one box wonder, unless you're working out of, you know, in the box in a computer. But there's a lot of peripheral stuff that needs to be part of an electronic music studio. So, for example, in your case, what do you use to record your work? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Oh, I just go straight into my computer, usually through Ableton or Logic. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Do you use a lot of outboard gear, or, is it mostly in the box for, for studio work? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>It's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1379.565" data-end_ts="1379.985" title="1379.565" id=c_"1379.565">__mainly__</span>, it's in the box, as in, in the computer in the software 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right now. Is it different when you, when you, do performances? Like you say you go and you do performances on the easel. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, it's a beautiful box, but it's also sort of, it needs some peripheral items, <laugh>, you know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And, what do you, what do you use in a performance situation 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>For the most recent performances? And they sort of change up by, you know, what I'm working on and exploring, but, most recently I used the I program card, Uhhuh <affirmative>, so on the easel. So I had like 30 different presets or what, Alan Strange and Don <span style="color:red" data-ts="1420.315" data-end_ts="1420.735" title="1420.315" id=c_"1420.315">__Buchla__</span> called them as, performance definitions or instruments. Okay. So that it's more than just a preset, it's something that then you then work and sculpt in real time. But that gave me a, a huge variety. And then the only other two outboard, pieces of gear I ever use, is a looper. And it's like the RC three or something. It's, you know, only does one loop. It's a boss. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Real simple, really simple. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Yeah. And then, the ide, H nine, and I use that sparingly uhhuh, you know, compositionally. It's something that sort of fun to bring in near the end <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Well, because it sonically it can kind of take over the landscape if you let it, but, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Right. Yeah. So, I use the looper so that I can, you know, I have to think ahead. I, I always like, sparse gestures that have silence and breath between them. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I think that's probably because I come from a wind instrument background, <laugh>, I, I try to find a way my electronics can breathe. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>And, so it's very, you know, one technique is to start off with just a sound that then has a lot of ma or space around it, and then another one. And, so I might do, sounds like that for two minutes or something, and then find out that that was looped. And so I have all this space now that I can then fill in on successive loops and build that way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So what do you do to sort of like, avoid the, you know, a lot of times when you see looped performances, what, what you end up seeing is sort of this, this concept where it's like, oh, I'm gonna build up a loop now I'm gonna shut it down. I'm gonna start up and build up a loop again. And it ends up being kind of a OneNote performance arc. You know, what, what do you do to kind of avoid that problem? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>No rhythm <laugh> for starters. Oh 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Good point. I mean, and like I, what I was just describing is, you know, if I whoa, space, space, space, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>More space, then I can come back and, you know, two minutes of that. And when I hit loop, you might not even recognize it as a loop because you might not remember that first gesture. 'cause we've been through some, and then I can respond to that first gesture. And so it becomes a, a call <span style="color:red" data-ts="1579.905" data-end_ts="1580.065" title="1579.905" id=c_"1579.905">__and__</span> response, if you will. Or it can be, you know, that's one, one technique. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Another is to then just start layering maybe, a, a constant, some sort of interesting verbally bandwidth that then these play against. So, yeah. I, and then, you know, the transitions of course are the big, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1605.305" data-end_ts="1605.525" title="1605.305" id=c_"1605.305">__are__</span> are the big issue. I think that's true for all composers, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, how do you make the transition and make it make sense? You can do a jump shift. Sometimes that'll work, or you can do a cross fade, or you can fade out, fade in, yada, yada. There's not too many choices. And so often what I will do is, actually, you know, build up and build up and build up and then also add some serious reverb. And the pedal is bizarre because unless I bend down and turn the volume out, I can't cross fade. I have to do a jump <span style="color:red" data-ts="1641.725" data-end_ts="1641.845" title="1641.725" id=c_"1641.725">__ship__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>I have to cut it out. So I usually, you know, in some cases I'll create such a huge, massive sound, that's in now looping and then going out through the H nine. So then when it cuts out, I know I have like a three to seven second tail Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, but before doing that, I will have created a completely new texture on the easel that then will be revealed when that tail disappears. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. So you actually work with the pedals on the floor? Yeah. Oh. 'cause so many people I see, they, you know, they keep 'em on the tabletop with them so that they can access those controls in real time. That's, that's interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Yeah. I, I'm too busy accessing all the sliders on <laugh> easel <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>I don't wanna give up my fingers. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure, I can hear that. And so you don't, you don't use an external mixer or anything then? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>No. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's pretty fascinating. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Yeah. I did use an external mixer on the dyke because I had at least three or four different sound trains going <span style="color:red" data-ts="1708.875" data-end_ts="1709.095" title="1708.875" id=c_"1708.875">__Mm__</span>. That I then could pull in and out and mix and match. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That's, that was the next thing I was gonna ask. The <span style="color:red" data-ts="1716.275" data-end_ts="1716.695" title="1716.275" id=c_"1716.275">__bookla__</span> really isn't super capable of multiple sound paths, right? Mm-Hmm. But some of the other systems are, is that something that you, you don't focus on? Because I see, and it's just a thing for me, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But a lot of times when I go and see performers that are using a modular live, they have this pre-packed system that looks like, kind of an ostrich nest, right. <laugh>. And, and it has a whole bunch of pre-packed things that they're able to kind of switch back and forth from. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And while I am, happy for them that they did that, it also is it, it seems odd to me. I, I would have trouble, first of all, I would have trouble sort of like managing a, a multi <span style="color:red" data-ts="1768.505" data-end_ts="1768.855" title="1768.505" id=c_"1768.505">__voice__</span> thing that's kind of mixed up together in that way. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But also because it seems like one of the points of immediacy is being able to do oddball patching on the fly. You know, all of a sudden I have this desire to hear, you know, a an extra envelope mod, you know, changing the modulation level of this thing. I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1790.805" data-end_ts="1790.925" title="1790.805" id=c_"1790.805">__wanna__</span> patch it. Now, I don't want to think about, oh, did I ever patch that at some point in the past, and is it maybe already in there and I have to find it? Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Yep. Yep. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Do you, do you ever, do, do you ever do stuff where you have these multiple paths and do you ever, do you ever do like heavily pre patched stuff? Or are you more of an on <span style="color:red" data-ts="1811.525" data-end_ts="1811.685" title="1811.525" id=c_"1811.525">__the__</span> fly guy? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>I'm totally on the fly. In fact, it's true. I follow the sound. Whatever sound comes up first, that's, begins the process. I mean, this comes from a few free improv groups. I used to work with Trapezium. And, you know, we tried to do, you know, okay, who's gonna start? You're gonna start, okay. And you're gonna do something like this, that, that lasted one performance. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Then we <laugh> eventually just said, okay, we're on stage. Whoever starts, then we follow that Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And we don't know. Didn't know. And, and sometimes at my performances I've, I've gone, I've had, children come up and move all the sliders on my easel, <laugh> without sound Nice. And then they go back and then I turn the volume up and that becomes the first sound. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1867.065" data-end_ts="1867.285" title="1867.065" id=c_"1867.065">__Oh__</span>, interesting. That's really, that's really cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Yeah. And, it's living on the edge for sure. I mean, this could all fall apart anytime actually with my last, you know, my performances in Europe and here on the West Coast, I even upped the ante more by my last patch was always a feedback patch. Hmm. Which you never know, I mean. Right. You know, they, they watch me turning this knob and nothing's happening until <laugh> <laugh>. And then it's like, okay, we'll get the surfboard and ride this, ride this sound, you know? Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Very interesting. So now having had this experience working with sort of like free improv ensemble, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1918.755" data-end_ts="1918.975" title="1918.755" id=c_"1918.755">__you__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1918.975" data-end_ts="1919.095" title="1918.975" id=c_"1918.975">__know__</span>, I've done that in the past, and one of the things that I learned, my friend Andrew, likes to talk about how the best in, in an improv ensemble kind of environment, the best players are the ones that listen five times as much as they play. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Yes, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Absolutely. And, you learn a lot about it, but it seems like that in combination with your, you know, what you described as your nature as a win player of wanting to hear a place for breaths, it seems like one of your kind of like points of mindfulness is the space and not the notes, or not even the sound. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Absolutely. Absolutely. And that, that comes, not only from being a wind player, but for the last 30 years I've played, the Japanese bamboo flute, the Shaku <span style="color:red" data-ts="1973.695" data-end_ts="1974.015" title="1973.695" id=c_"1973.695">__Hachi__</span>. Mm. Which is devoted to silence <laugh>. Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1979.515" data-end_ts="1979.735" title="1979.515" id=c_"1979.515">__The__</span>, I mean, when you study Kochi, you study the, the space between, you know, you could play, I could go in and play for the master, and, he would say, yeah, you got all the notes. Right. But the, the ma was totally wrong <laugh> space. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Very interesting. So now one of the other things that space though provides is the opportunity for, for rhythm. Right. And, because rhythm is just sort of like a kind of uniform use of space in between the notes, I guess. I guess that's a way to think of it. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. What, how do you approach rhythm? Because when, when I listen to some of your music, your website actually has a really nice collection of things to listen to that, that I really enjoyed. It's interesting because what I don't hear is something where the rhythm is developed by spaces and events, but it tends to be more of phrases and almost like a wave, you know, or like a title action. I'm just wondering what it is that, you know, when you're developing these, when you're, when you're developing a composition, what is it that for you generates this rhythmic movement? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Wow. That's a good question. I don't know that I've ever even thought about that. You know, I mean, of course if it's in, in, let's take a <inaudible>. The, the rhythm's going to come from a 2 81, know function generator. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, that's cycling. I don't like to hear the same thing over and over and over for very long. So that's maybe why you hear these ebbs and flows. So I see I'm finding subtle ways to change the articulation, the attack decay on something that's already cycling so that it has more of a organic feel to it. Right. I mean, this comes back to, you know, baroque music. You never play eighth <span style="color:red" data-ts="2110.365" data-end_ts="2110.645" title="2110.365" id=c_"2110.365">__note__</span> straight, just like in jazz. You never play <span style="color:red" data-ts="2113.185" data-end_ts="2113.405" title="2113.185" id=c_"2113.185">__da__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2113.425" data-end_ts="2113.645" title="2113.425" id=c_"2113.425">__da__</span>. It's, true, in baroque music as well as jazz. So I guess I'm always, hadn't thought about it, but I'm un unconsciously, influenced by both those streams of my past <span style="color:red" data-ts="2128.685" data-end_ts="2129.005" title="2128.685" id=c_"2128.685">__lives__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Well, speaking of like the organic nature stuff too, the other thing I would say is that, you know, with the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2136.285" data-end_ts="2136.685" title="2136.285" id=c_"2136.285">__booklet__</span> systems, you always had this, you know, there's touch plates or whatever. There was a kind of the alternate controller mentality. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And certainly your work with the, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2148.285" data-end_ts="2148.485" title="2148.285" id=c_"2148.285">__Hawkin__</span> continuum points that as well. What, what is your preference for the way that you control the sound? And, what is, I mean, are any of these things sort of like your preference? Or is your preference something else that you have? Or is it something that has yet to be invented? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b><laugh>? My preference is sliders and knobs. That's totally where I'm at. I love the easel and I love the pressure. And I use the pressure to go, you know, send that to every parameter you, I can possibly think of. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, the hawken of course is, is wonderful because you have X, Y, and Z and can program those to anything you want. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2197.475" data-end_ts="2197.695" title="2197.475" id=c_"2197.475">__But__</span> like with the hordy performance <span style="color:red" data-ts="2199.215" data-end_ts="2199.495" title="2199.215" id=c_"2199.215">__there__</span>, there was no keyboard, there was no sequencer. It was all just knobs. Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2204.505" data-end_ts="2204.855" title="2204.505" id=c_"2204.505">__Which__</span>, so, yeah. I, my endless daily exploration of sound is, spent turning knobs, flipping switches, <laugh>, and writing sliders. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And it's always the knobs and sliders that are on the instrument itself. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Yes. Absolutely. I really <span style="color:red" data-ts="2227.555" data-end_ts="2227.715" title="2227.555" id=c_"2227.555">__want__</span>, I need to feel in touch, you know, like, you know, with the sliders on the easel, I mean, I, I feel like I'm pretty darn close to the electrons. Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2240.235" data-end_ts="2240.455" title="2240.235" id=c_"2240.235">__As__</span> opposed to a mapped slider or a mapped, a midi mapped, a fader <laugh>, which is like so far removed from what's happening that, I don't feel connection. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, it's funny because after the la after I did a interview with, Rob Hordy, I actually had a chance then to play with one of the blue boxes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Oh yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And that's what I felt like, I felt like I had my hand on the electrons and I was kind of like swinging them around. <laugh> <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, my definition of music is it's sculpting energy. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright, so, boy, our time is already just about up, but before we go, I wanna talk a little bit more about the kinds of things you do as an educator. 'cause you, you currently are doing, you do some training for Mac Pro video. You do these Skype things. You do, you have a number of different tutorial things online. And you know, I, I spend my time trying to teach people how to do electronic music stuff too, through my interaction with Max. But I am curious what in your mind is, is the, is the difficulty and maybe also, or potentially in addition to being the, kind of affordances of electronic music as a teaching tool for musical expression. I mean, what is it, what do you, why is it that you stayed in that and what is it about teaching that, that you enjoy? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>I love watching light bulbs go off <laugh>. I love, watching students, or clients go Aha. And, and then start running with it. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So, you know, hopefully what I provide is a, a springboard, or a catalyst, to their curiosity and imagination. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, that's really interesting. Well, Todd, I want to thank you for your, again, for your time. It was fantastic. If I'm going <span style="color:red" data-ts="2374.585" data-end_ts="2374.665" title="2374.585" id=c_"2374.585">__to__</span> send people off to, look up your stuff, where's the best place for them to get sort of a, a good taste of your work? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>Todd Bartoncom and then sort of like, click around there. I think there's some links right there on that first page. Otherwise my YouTube channel or my Instagram, and I'm synth Todd, S-Y-N-T-A Todd on Instagram. And that's where I'm posting a lot of stuff, every, everything from educational to just what's, what my explorations are. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that's fantastic. I hope everyone takes a chance to take a good look. So with that, I am going to let you have the rest of your day. Thank you so much, Todd, for your time. I really appreciate it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Todd: </b>My pleasure. It was great meeting you Darwin, and you have a great day. Alright, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, many thanks to Todd for that great chat. Guy's, amazing. What a background from early music to Extreme Modernists. Pretty fun ride. I want to thank you all for listening again this week and continuing to listen. It's just really great to have a nice audience that is enjoying the work that I'm doing. It was really great, great to meet a bunch of you at the NAMM Show. That was really awesome. I also want to especially thank, all the people that have recently picked up my new releases. It's darwin gross.bandcamp.com. I've got a couple of, historical releases, archival releases of mine. I'm working on actually a brand new set of compositions that hopefully be out, early spring. Thank you so much for listening, and I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2485.785" data-end_ts="2485.945" title="2485.785" id=c_"2485.785">__will__</span> catch you again next week.
