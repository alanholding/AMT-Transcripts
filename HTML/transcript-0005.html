    <h2>Transcription: Barry Moon</h2>
    <h3>Released: November 10, 2013</h3>
<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Shortly introduction this week. This week's interview is with Barry moon. I first ran into, well I won't say I first ran into him, I actually ran into him recently when I was out on YouTube looking for Maximus P tutorials. And I found this huge collection by someone named BAS, BAS Z BAS tutorials. They were really interesting and I decided digging a little further and also notice that he was on the, on the forum an awful lot. So I put together a little email message, asked him if he wanted to have an interview. He said, sure. Uh, well I find out that it's Barry moon, someone who I remember interacting with a little bit on the old __Macs__ mailing lists back in the day. It turns out that he is a really rich history with electro acoustic music of all sorts and uh, turned out to be a fascinating article not only talking about teaching but about learning and keeping your practice up and uh, working in performance. So I hope you enjoy this. I thought it was a fascinating interview. Thanks. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>All right. Today we are going to be talking to burying moon, who is a person who I first ran across, uh, in his YouTube videos. He did a series of videos called the Baz tutorials, which were both phenomenally successful in terms of YouTube views, but also were really successful in the way that they presented the material. Um, Highbury hi, how's it going? It's going great. Um, Barry is also an active member of the urn, uh, speaker on the forums and cycling 74, which is another place where I see him fairly often. Um, Barry, why don't you tell us a little bit about yourself, uh, what you're, what you're doing and kind of your background. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Barry Moon: </b>Okay. Uh, yeah, what I sort of started off with was a succession of sort of failed attempts to be grown up, which I think is probably everybody's story, but, you know, wanting to be a, uh, a, a classical guitarist and then wanting to be an audio engineer and wanting to be all of these things that pretty much no one could get a real job in and just stayed in school long enough to get a, get a PhD and sort of fall into as a, Oh, well, I guess I kind of realized that academia was where I wanted to be just because I saw the professors that went when I was in an undergraduate in Australia. Just how great their life seemed that they get to do their own thing and, um, get paid to do it pretty much. And then, so, yeah, I mean, did, uh, got a PhD in composition at SUNY Buffalo, which was, which I got that about 99, uh, worked at Brown for awhile. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Barry: </b>Brown university with Todd Winkler there. Um, then went over and worked in bath baths by university and then, uh, it's, you know, England and then, uh, yeah, came back to to the States because the States is so much easier to deal with on some levels for me. But you know, what I do is primarily, um, I mean it's coming from a musical background. I'd say I still compose and do a lot of that stuff that I've been doing, sort of instrumental processing stuff that I started as a, as a grad student in Buffalo, working with court Libby there. Um, so yeah, live, you know, live performance with electronics composing works for that. I have a piece I just finished for two clarinets and pick Kushan, um, that was premiered at a, um, clarinet festival in the CZ. Um, but yeah, so doing the, of doing that side of things, the music side of things, I'm doing __a__ quite an amount of installation work. I work with, uh, at the moment working mostly with an artist named Hillary harp where we're doing, uh, public art installations, um, and various things that __their__ __death__ theme for the moment that we've got. Some grant funding to explore his happiness. So we're exploring the whole, um, how, along with along with some social science people figuring out how to, uh, use happiness as a, as a motivating force for our public art installations. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well that seems a little crazy because every artist I know dresses in black and wears kind of a dour,  most of the time. So, uh, that's, that's really interesting. Um, so you say that you just kind of stuck around until you got your PhD. Uh, but it also sounds like you've kind of had an opportunity to work with some of the stars of, uh, certainly the, uh, computation plus music world. If you got a chance to study on a court lippy and working with Todd Winkler that, that must've been pretty amazing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Barry: </b>Yeah, I mean, court was definitely, you know, at that time really the largest influence on the greatest influence on what I was doing. Um, you know, I left Peter auto left a year after I started the program there and somehow managed to conscript court to come over and from, from your comp. Um, and so of course was introduced well before __court__ even came there, be introduced to max FTS and started with that whole scene really pretty early on. You know what I mean? 92 or 93 or so. __It__ was when I started with that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Did you ever work on any of the, uh, the real old hardware? I guess if you are working with FTS, you had a chance to yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Barry: </b>Yeah. So I was, I was working with the ice PW and the econ signal processing workstation for those of you have just about everybody __who__ was too old to know for __a__ bird. Yeah. So working with that stuff, uh, you know, and I, I was supposedly the system as part of my TA work. I was supposedly the systems administration person for the next, there'll be, we're running and I swear I couldn't ever figure out the next operating system. So that was a miserable failure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That seems to be a common story for people that interact with __that__. That's funny. So let's talk about, uh, some of, some of your work. First of all, I'd like to kind of talk a little bit about, uh, these __BAS__ tutorials. It's a pretty phenomenal collection of tutorials, video tutorials that you created and posted on YouTube. Um, how did you decide to take that on? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Barry: </b>Uh, it was primarily because I was working. Um, I, you know, as, as a matter of sort of everything that I do, I tend to work with software that I don't understand very well, a lot. And so I was working with blender at that time. Um, so yeah, I just didn't, my various pieces of software that I've learned, which are just, you know, there's just too many of them. Um, I found that the video tutorials for blender that I was finding, uh, were really helping me a lot and helping me understand how to work with the software in ways that I couldn't figure out by just looking at manuals and stuff. Um, and you know, and some of these tutorials are given by like 12 year olds and stuff. And it's, it's amazing to me the amount of useful information and how helpful they can be when they're not even, you know, in any way, you know, teaching and through __their__, they have no experience teaching as far as I know. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Barry: </b>And, and so I just figured that, you know, with the amount of knowledge, you know, some of it's probably completely useless knowledge, but all of the, the amount of knowledge that I have in Maximus P that I could give people, you know, I could give some of that to the community and, and people might like it. And I was kind of surprised, I suppose that the popularity mostly because coming from a background from teaching when I was teaching at bath spa, primarily teaching Maximus P, uh, the students really don't like it. And I, and I S and I S I suppose they don't like it in just about all the programs, for instance. And somehow, I don't know, there's something about, I suppose the video tutorial, maybe it's just impersonal enough and that, you know, I'm not dictating to anybody. Uh, that is just, it's, it's kind of makes it more relaxed and makes it easier for people to deal with and having meet my actual presence there. And, you know, having, having some kind of physical presence where people feel intimidated or you know, or just pissed off or whatever. I don't know what people feel when they, when they sit in my class. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I know it's, that's impossible to know. The other thing I'm always curious about, and I have to admit, I don't really have a, I don't have much of a clue about this, but I wonder how often video tutorials are treated sort of as passive viewing, almost like you're watching max max, max MSP T V or something versus actually as an active teaching environment. Yeah. I don't, I don't know how that works out. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Barry: </b>Yeah. I mean this, I mean, when I was doing my undergrad studies, when teacher in, uh, in Melbourne at Latrobe university, David Hurst was, uh, I was trying, I was doing a what's called an __honors__ here, which they don't do in the States. And I think, um, but it was, yeah, I was trying to read the, I think the, the uh, what is that the more, um, the sort of that basic DSP tutorial thing, um, you know, the Andy Maura thing, uh, and just the math was not, __yeah__, I wasn't getting it at all and he just suggested, well, if you just keep reading it over and over and over again and, and just don't even try it to understand, but just let it sort of dwell, you know, I mean, and I think maybe that's the way some people have used those video tutorials is just to hear someone saying these things and somehow this knowledge does initially just sinking. Sure. That makes sense. Right. I guess, I mean I have, I mean, again, it's really the weird thing is that it's hard to gauge when you're making this stuff or teaching in general is hard to gauge how much people understand or how, how well it's working. When you obviously have nothing __they__ gauge with, you know what I mean? You can gauge with their feedback, but in the video or tutorial you don't even get that. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>right. That's, if anything, that's one of the real downsides is there's no feedback to play off of when you're trying to improve your work. So you did, uh, in all, I think 20 of the tutorials, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Barry: </b>Uh, I don't know how many there is. Yeah. But there's, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>yeah. And then you switched over to like a patch a day format where you kind of, uh, took on little projects and sort of did them in front of the camera and it looks like you did like over 40 of those, quite a body of work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Barry: </b>Yeah. My, I mean, my initial, I don't know who it was, who's who, it was, I think maybe, uh, maybe it was Luke Dubois or someone was, was talking about doing a song a day that year that I started dying at. And, um, yeah, I just sort of through Christmas and new year's idea, that's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna do her a patch today for the whole entire year. And of course you can't have a little brutal. That was never, that was never really __cute__. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So in the end, how exhausting was it? I mean, did you, did you come up with kind of a rhythm in how you would make it or was it sort of like a hand ringing job to do each one? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Barry: </b>Uh, I mean, doing the tutorials and the, and the Pacha day, it was kind of the same process where I would make a patch and then, uh, and then, you know, we'll just have it there made while I'm making the video so that I would remember what I'm doing. Um, and sometimes the only, you know, the only things that got kind of painful was when I would make mistakes and have to go back and some in, you know, the way it's just the same as playing music is that it tends to be that if you make a mistake that you're going to keep making the same mistake over and over 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>to just do it in rhythms so that it sounds like it was on purpose. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Barry: </b>And there's of course there's mistakes in the videos as well, and people, you know, sometimes, you know, sometimes the viewers catch them and sometimes I could call it them or whatever, but yeah, you're bound to make mistakes for sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So you've been a little bit quiet on that front for awhile. Have you just, uh, did you kind of exhaust that, uh, that passion a little bit? Or was it, uh, or did something else take over for you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Barry: </b>Uh, I guess, uh, I was going through a bit of a, I guess, you know, when I started the whole thing, I was going through something, I guess a swamp in my creative output. Then once that recovered, you know, I have just so much,  work to do in, in making stuff that I don't really have time to make those. But,  I mean I have still thought to go back to them. I have a, mostly as a way of getting back to doing some workshops that I'm thinking about for next, uh, for the spring, spring 2014 doing a series of workshops. Uh, so yeah, as a way of getting back into that and also as a way of advertising those workshops I guess is to get back into it. But, uh, I've, I've, I've been on sabbatical for this semester so far and just enjoying or just really remembering what it's like to not have to think about, you know, teaching and all that stuff is, it's a bit too much of a temptation for, has been too much of a temptation to actually get any serious work done. But, uh, I'll go, you know, eventually I'll get to work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, I hear that. Um, so you S uh, talking about your teaching, you teach at Arizona state university, right? Yeah. Um, you're associate professor there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Barry: </b>Yeah, I'm a, I'm an associate professor in a, in a program called interdisciplinary arts and performance, uh, which is, you know, you know, a larger, well, it's sort of nested within humanities, arts and cultural studies, which is nested inside a new college of interdisciplinary arts and sciences. And it's, I mean, the thing that was really attractive and I, and I still like, I mean when I came from the UK, I was teaching it, uh, in a, in a spiders, in a CMT, uh, uh, creative music technology, which there, which exist all over the place in the, in the UK. Um, and um, as much as I liked that it was, the students came from a fairly narrow demographic, you know, most of them were all wanting to be producers or DJs and people that they wanted to be kind of, they had this kind of fame thing that I couldn't really, uh, abide by. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Barry: </b>They were all attaining to become famous. Um, you know, just like, you know, they wanted to be massive attack or POTUS head, you know, any, one of the number of famous groups from around Bristol and birth. Um, but __she__,  the sorts of thing, the Minnesota thing that really attracted me to, for the, uh, Arizona state thing was that they, it's pretty rare to find a place that will have someone like me that's not a music department or you know, a specific department, which I'm not, you know, sort of not really cut out for, I mean, it's not that there'll be an issue, but if I was in music, I might have to teach music theory and things that I really don't care to talk to people about. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, I understand. And I'm kinda in the same place I teach here in Denver at the university of Denver. And uh, luckily the interdisciplinary part of it is kind of stuck into the art and humanities area as well, which is kind of a comfortable place to work actually. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Barry: </b>Yeah. No, I mean I really just for the variety of teaching as well, uh, even though sometimes I end up teaching things that I just, because I feel the students need it, I ended up teaching things that I'm not entirely as comfortable with as I would like to be when teaching them. But in some ways I haven't noticed that that's a particularly bad thing to be not comfortable with what you're doing when you're teaching the students at least feel, I think it makes them comfortable to realize that it's not easy and you know, even for someone like me or whatever, that it's not easy to do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Well, I'm a question for you is, uh, as having a pH D in music, do you find that that's helpful or in some ways harmful when you're trying to work with people whose primary discipline is something else? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Barry: </b>Uh, I think it really, it's hard to say whether it's helpful or, or, or unhelpful. I would say probably given, you know, uh, my teaching recently, I would say that I'd probably be better off with an MFA in some ways. Um, just from, you know, the sorts of things that I would have picked up in an MFA that I don't have that I should have, I think is, you know, things like, uh, a much better understanding of history and of the visual arts in general. Um, where, you know, all my knowledge and everything that they drummed into me through the PhD was all music of course. So yeah, I mean definitely some broad in our broader areas to understand __it__ was understanding would be good, would have been good, but mean I can't see that. You know, my, my mom's always likes to talk about what my mom says cause she's weighed more, she's way smarter than I am. But yeah, she, she, she likes to say that, you know, there's no wasted education. I think that's true. And I think you can learn anything that's going to be a complete waste, still find some use for it somewhere along the way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Of course. Um, so in your, uh, in your program, how does interdisciplinary work, is it, um, like more performance work? Is it more of interactive and installation work? What kind of stuff do you tend to focus on? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Barry: </b>Uh, well the, the costs, the program itself has, the students are kind of forced to take part in performance-based stuff, movement, performance-based work. They have to do a certain amount of visual __art__ work, whether that's that's digital, __***<inaudible>***__, digital end, undigital, whatever that might mean. Um, and they also have to do a certain amount of sound work, which is for the area that I'm primarily involved in is sound. But of course I do do some work in interactive, uh, sort of design with interaction design with a visual end sound because we, I mean have half of the programs. I mean __we'll__, part of the other program that we provide to is, uh, is an applied computing program. Um, so I, you know, I teach Maximus P as a way or in that kind of interaction design as a way into it. Um, I have used processing to do the same kind of thing as well. __Um__, mostly cause the, that, that text, um, the processing book that the guy who wrote it, now I'm just like blanking out on all the names and everything, but, um, yeah, the, the documentation for processing is in some ways a lot more, he's a lot better. And also many of the students in any applied computing come from a Java background or they at least proport to come from a Java background. They don't seem to do very well with it for, well, I shouldn't say anything. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I hear what you're saying. But I agree. It's funny because sometimes, uh, in classes I've seen where people come in with a pretty significant computing background, but that doesn't necessarily translate into quality programming. It's kind of, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Barry: </b>yeah. Um, and, and, and for me, I think the Maximus P paradigm is useful for, for programmers of any software, you know, because I think that it gives them a new way of looking at what they do. I mean a new way of thinking about what writing __corrode__ is, you know, um, and of course it makes them realize that how easy it is they're using four loops and all that is so much. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Right. There are certain things that max __will__ make you run back to a text editor for what are there, what are the kinds of software that you use in, uh, in your teaching practice? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Barry: </b>Uh, I've used, I mean, I teach a blender a fair bit, um, in both, you know, using it with, in conjunction with some of the interaction stuff and as a sort of, as a means of producing animation and modeling just as a, as a way of producing art that way. Um, processing, like I said, unity three D is something that I've been playing with a lot in the last couple of years. Uh, maximize P,  I would like to get in more PD and evolve pure data, but, um, it's still, I don't know, it's, people still have a fair, fairly large problem with the interface on __pure__ data, um, students. That is, they don't like the way it looks. So 1980s, but, um, yeah, that's pretty much it. I mean, I'm not, I mean, I, I use Ableton live and sort of teach it in my summer, my introduction sound design class and of course I use and teach, um, pro tools, which is just, you know, like I think that everybody uses and uses pro tools and doesn't like it, but that's just the nature of the beast. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I always felt like with pro tools there was a, there was a reason why we all hated tape recorders and we just picked up that hatred and brought it right over to pro tools when that came on. So it's just as a, it's just as hard to use for sure. True enough. So let's, uh, talk a little bit about, uh, your own personal performance and installation work. So, uh, you mentioned a few things that you were into. What, what are the most active things that you're doing right now? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Barry: </b>Uh, in addition to the happy, the happy place project, which is the one I'm involved with, Hillary harp, uh, that's probably the most, and along with that is the pin cushion is a duo that I have with Doug Nottingham. Uh, Doug is a professor in a school really close by to me in, in, uh, at Glendale community college and he's a phenomenal percussionist and, and, and, and pretty good with electronics himself. So yeah, we, we do a live performance thing, uh, which is I do, I suppose I'm primarily focused on the video, but I __don't__ like to, I like the challenge of having to try and play music and to feel the same. It's just that, you know, it's like repairing your head and rubbing your stomach. They said maybe 10 times. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, I have to admit that that's an impossibility. Me. Every time I've tried, I either end up like focusing on their video and just realized I presented a 20 minute drone. Or conversely, I focus on the sound and music and I just realized the same image had been hovering over me for the last 20 minutes. So that's just the tough one. Um, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Barry: </b>and I __mean__, I still do have some, you know, I have some, I used to do a lot more solo stuff and I would kinda like to get back to that, but there's something about, you know, working in collaboration that, that I really would like to just keep working with other people, you know. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I agree. Now you say that you primarily in, in pin cushion, do you primarily, uh, focus on, on visuals? Is that sort of a conscious choice? Are you trying to push yourself in that area particularly, or is that just how it naturally fell into place? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Barry: </b>Uh, I guess it's __mostly__ because Doug doesn't do that. And we started __when__ we started the duo, uh, I think it was, I don't know, I can't remember what year, 2008 or so, 2009 maybe. But do you know, when we started out, I mean that was kind of the whole thing as a BA, you're going to do the visuals and, and we're going to do the music together. So we sort of made that. Yeah, we made that decision. Um, and I, for me the visual, you know, working with visuals is, is sort of largely a learning process. Um, you know, I use, uh, or the most of the earliest works that we have a I used touch designer, which is, uh, which is a windows XP, well windows, windows based thing. Um, and touch designer. When I first started using it, I thought, I thought it was magic cause it was, it was just like Maximus P was, you know, an object __and__ __I__ connect the connect the outlets, I mean lets and stuff. So it was pretty similar and I could figure how, how to use it fairly quickly. Um, and it produced really amazing results without even thinking too. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Barry: </b>So I like, yeah. So I liked working with touch and then, you know, uh, that kind of, I suppose looking for alternatives to that kinda got me started with unity three D. um, admittedly, you know, some of the work that we do is in, uh, __Maximus PGA__ there, but I, I sorta haven't, __while__ I, maybe I shouldn't be probably talking to the wrong guys __just__ __that__ complaining about __Jeter__, but 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>that's, uh, this is, this is a great platform part. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Barry: </b>I'm just not real happy with the way gender looks. Um, and especially you get anything even remotely complex going on in your frame rate is going down as 15 and yeah, I, you know, some of those, uh, programs that are running much more efficiently on the GPU, uh, including __***<inaudible>***__, which includes touch designer and unity 3d. Um, I just, you, I just loved the performance, uh, the frame rate, you know, pushing 60, even when things get really tough in unity is awesome. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. There's something about a high frame rate that makes even simple things look better. There's, there's something that really happens there. So with unity three D that, that uses a Java script, like scripting language, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Barry: </b>Uh, yeah. I mean, you get to choose. It's yes. JavaScript, like most people in the, in the biz call it unity script. Um, and it uses a, either that or C sharp, which is the more, probably more popular interface. And you can also work in BU, which is something I know absolutely nothing about. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Um, so in sort of the position you're in, working at a university and, and having interacted with a lot of people, you probably get a fair number of, uh, opportunities or, or offers to perform. What do you personally, how, how do you choose what you're going to do performance wise or installation wise? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Barry: </b>Um, I guess so, you know, probably, you know, if I had to, if this was a job interview, I'd say that's probably my, my, my biggest fault is that I don't choose very carefully so that I will, um, tend to, uh, take projects when I've got too many projects already on. So yeah. I don't tie time choose well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I hear that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Barry: </b>Yeah. So I, I, yeah, at some point learning how to say no is probably going to be the lifesaver. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure, sure. I, I can hear that. So as, as sort of an extension on that discussion, um, I'd like to talk a little bit about the interaction between, uh, work and creativity. So you're in a position where you do a lot, you work in the creative environment and you use creative tools as part of your work, uh, the, the job that you do. Um, but you also have a performance and, and, um, production kind of projects going on all the time. How do you maintain, um, how do you stay creative when art and technology is part of your everyday job? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Barry: </b>Uh, yeah, it's, I mean, it was harder when I was teaching, uh, you know, more focused in, in enter in the creative music technology program. It's since I teach such a wide variety of things and, um, I don't really cover anything in depth and sort of higher level in the software that I do enjoy. So, you know, if I, if I had to teach, uh, you know, graduate students in Maximus P programming and some of the other, I'd probably wouldn't have as much energy for it. I mean, I definitely noticed that when I taught guitar, I just, when I way back when and this is going back to the eighties and nineties. I mean I just, I couldn't play guitar anymore. It was just totally sucking the joy. 
</p>

<b>Barry: </b>But teaching, teaching the software thing and teaching people how to here, which I think is primarily what I like to do anyway. I mean when are we teaching classes related to software? It's sort of easy enough to, with the number of resources out there now, it's also easy enough to send them somewhat on their Merry way to learn the software and focus in class on things that that would actually be, you know, that I am kind of expert in that they might not find easily somewhere else, which you know, is basically critiquing and, and being able and learning to hear what they're doing, learning to see what they're doing. Um, so yeah, it's  I mean the definitely the sort of art side to it is, is a huge draw. I think that's why there is that tradition in teaching art that's not so quite so strong and teaching of music is that you have that sort of learning to see or learn, you know, learning to critique and learning to talk about what you're doing as opposed to learning the, the, the tools which we sort of have to do by ourselves outside of class time I suppose would be the approach I like to take anyway. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Um, that makes me that, that actually makes me curious about something. Um, in the, in teaching music, one of the things that you spend a lot of time working with students on is dis is helping them learn how to practice and pushing them to practice a fish effectively and efficiently and enough. Do you find that there's any kind of practice regimen that works for your students or even works for you? Do you have a practice regimen that you have for yourself? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Barry: </b>Uh, I mean for myself, I definitely do the best in the morning. So I mean that's, that's just a personality thing. A lot. Everybody has a different time and a bit different way that they work. That's good. And yeah, I mean if I'm working, I like to just shut myself away, which has become easier or harder based on what's going on around me. But, uh, students, some of them are good too. I mean some of them get to know what that is, but I find that, uh, I find that unless they're in a sort of, in the, uh, they kind of in the habit of doing, create a lot of creative work that they do find it difficult to complete work. Um, you know, getting to F just getting to find out what their personal regimen should be I think is probably the greatest, one of the greatest challenges they face. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Barry: </b>And again, we can't teach it to them. We can only let them find out through throwing a lot of work at them. What that is. Um, which is one thing that I do like to do for that is to give students a lot of small projects and so that they don't have the comfort of waiting __till__ the week before that final is due to actually do something that they actually have to be working all semester long so that they actually, you know, have to be completing little things along the way so that there's no sort of let up on the, on the, on the, on the attention for what they're doing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I found that really effective too. If for no other reason, then it prevented getting a lot of phone calls on the Sunday night before. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Barry: </b>That's pretty, that's true. Yeah. Yeah. And I, and I don't answer those phone calls. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, good for you. That's discipline. All right. Um, so part of sort of maintaining creativity for oneself, uh, kind of goes back to something that also happened at the very beginning when we got into things. People who influence you, uh, people who stimulate you into either trying something new or getting back into the groove, who are, who are some of the people or what are some of the projects that you've seen that have either, either were influential to early, are influential to now or just generally stimulate you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Barry: </b>Uh, I have to admit that I don't really look at all, listen to a lot of what other people do now. I mean, there's been periods when I've listened to a, looked at a lot more. I think, you know, initially I was very much influenced and I think that influence still runs through what I do by, um, the kind of what I suppose most people would call modernists. You know, people, um, including Boulez and going back to all of the, uh, __***<inaudible>***__ beg and all these people. __We're__ finding new ways to create systems or new new systems based on nothing but thin air. Um, and so, and, and the kind of ideal I think of, you know, stock housing is another, but people, people who weren't concerned so much with the product that they were producing as much as they were worried about the kind of, the ramifications of it and what it meant, I guess, you know what it means to be doing what you're doing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Barry: </b>Um, because it's, I mean it's hard to admit that you don't listen to or look at a lot of new stuff is kind of, um, kind of probably not the sort of thing that most people who go to university want to hear. But I think that, uh, we kind of, there's a, there's a period that we're in now where, you know, having gone sort of post postmodern, I feel like it, I feel like we sorta still in icon of, you know, are in that same kind of quandary as we were with, with the kind of postmodernism is that we're in this, um, sort of, you know, if you like it, do it sort of thing in a fur feels good, do it kind of thing without thinking too much about what it really means to be doing what you're doing. Um, so yeah, I mean, of course I listened to a lot of music and look at a lot of stuff that I, __why__ come in and go through periods I liked, you know, um, I like Radiohead and, and I like, uh, uh, you know what, I don't listen to, you know, I guess that's something that students always want to ask you is like what sort of music you listen to. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Barry: </b>And I swear I don't listen to anything. Um, that's considered classical anymore. I mean, so I listened to all taker a lot. And, uh, you know, all of the sort of walk prey codes scene. Um, so yeah, I mean the, the sorts of things that I look at and listen to tend to be kind of verging on that, um, sort of post modern sort of happy go lucky stuff, but there's something a little bit deeper I think in a lot of that work. Um, you're talking about __or__ we'll take her, there's something there that isn't just merely a kind of, you know, this makes me feel good kind of thing. It's got a, it's got some meat to it. It's got something that's actually really deep. It's constantly deeper going on it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I totally agree with that. Um, one question about something you just said, talking about some of the people whose work represented system creation, like, like Stockhausen or I thinking of the many different approaches cage took. Yeah. Do you feel like that, like there's still an opportunity for the development of these kinds of systems or do you think that too much stuff has been invented and we're just chasing shiny objects at this point? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Barry: </b>Uh, no, I think that the, I mean, the, the interesting thing is that the systems that we can keep inventing and creating produce output and produce, uh, artifacts that are most people can't accept as being good or worthwhile. So, I mean, I'm, I'm happier for to create something that's not worthwhile and not, um, not, not necessarily aesthetically pleasing if it feels like it comes from genuine place, if it feels like it, um, you know, if it feels like it has that sort of substance to it and it's not just, it's not just flipping, like pushing the, you know, pushing a button. I mean, that's kind of the thing that I suppose I was into for a long time. And one of the reasons I liked maximum is P __furs__ so long is that it was so easy to come up with something completely new without trying. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Barry: </b>I mean, you just, you just play around connecting objects together and you'll end up with something new. Um, and again, sort of not necessarily aesthetically pleasing. Um, but yeah, once you take that approach one step further and actually start thinking about what it is that you want to make, that might not exist, then I think that, you know, those sorts of programs or those approaches of, of inventing by inventing, by just, uh, you know, like the, like just making __go__ __man__, always he's cooking analogies but you can't learn __to__, you can't really learn to make, um, some of the greatest recipes you need to just play around with ingredients and until you just happen upon this wonderful taste that you've never tasted before. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I, I get that there's almost, uh, it does seem right now, like things are more interesting if you feel like the represented development rather than if they just represented execution in some way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Barry: </b>Yeah, I mean I think there's room for both. I mean, you know, again, playing in a, um, you know, you know, playing in, in pin cushion, I think that, um, that live performance thing always involves the execution of things, um, on a level where, you know, you can't necessarily create anything, um, that well-developed and people have always, you know, taken me to issue and I'm taken everybody who does anything interactive to issue on, well, you guys aren't making anything that's polished. You know, what's wrong with you? You know, why can't you make something like that Dennis smally guy? You know, it's like, that's the best music ever, but Hey man, for how, because not all of us can be bothered sitting down with our pro tools rigs for the next three months, making one piece of 10 minute piece of music. You know, that's just don't feel they have many of us operate the way our brains operate. Right. Pretty much. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, Barry, thank you very much for, uh, your time. It was really great to talk to you and really great to kind of dive into some of these ideas and, and concepts. Um, I always give people a chance to, uh, first of all, tell me if there's anything exciting out there that we should pay attention to. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Barry: </b>Uh, yeah, you should pay attention to whatever it is that you're not paying attention to. That's great advice. That's excellent. __Yeah__. Finally, if there's any last words you want to say to what few listeners there are liable to be, uh, if, if it, if, if this makes it on air before the, before they, uh, fall of 2014 and get in touch and we'll, and we'll count and pin cushion and the whole, the whole, uh, Bez workshops will come to a town near you. Oh, that sounds, that sounds like a really great offer. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it and have a great day. Hey, pleasure. She is.
