<b>Darwin: </b>This episode of Art, music and Technology is brought to you by Recording Magazine based outta Boulder, Colorado. Recording Magazine provides information for recording artists, <span style="color:red" data-ts="17.045" data-end_ts="17.525" title="17.045" id=c_"17.045">__wedding__</span> engineers, and longtime professionals as well. You can check out their work@recordingmeg.com. Now, enjoy our podcast. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Thank you so much for tuning in again this week. This week I have the great, pleasure of getting <span style="color:red" data-ts="37.125" data-end_ts="37.245" title="37.125" id=c_"37.125">__a__</span> chance to meet, Anthony <span style="color:red" data-ts="38.945" data-end_ts="39.365" title="38.945" id=c_"38.945">__Matana__</span>. He is the founder and CEO of Hook Audio, which, kind of caught my attention at the recent NAMM show. It caught my attention for a couple reasons. First of all, they had an outdoor booth, which, since I'm from the Minneapolis area, the idea of being outdoors in January's kind of funny, but, in LA it <span style="color:red" data-ts="59.045" data-end_ts="59.205" title="59.045" id=c_"59.045">__make__</span> la it makes a lot more sense. They had a, they had a booth and they were, they were like plugging people into their system to check it out. And their system's pretty unique. It's a, it's a, ear mounted binaural system, but it works wirelessly with your phone. It has all kinds of other stuff. We'll, we'll have Anthony talk about it. So with that, I'm going to say hello to Anthony. Hey, Anthony. How's it going? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony Mattana - Hooke Audio: </b>Hey, Darwin, how's it going? Thanks so much for having me on your show. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, thanks a lot for, for being here. I really appreciate it. So, let's start off by having you explain, a little bit about Hook audio and, and particularly about, the product that you're selling. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>Totally. So, at Hook Audio, our big mission is changing the way people record the world personally. My more personal mission is killing mono audio on our phones, <laugh>. So what we have done is invented the world's first Bluetooth headphones that are capable of capturing wireless binaural audio over Bluetooth to Android and iOS devices. We've also invented a cable that one plugged into our hook <span style="color:red" data-ts="125.045" data-end_ts="125.325" title="125.045" id=c_"125.045">__verse__</span> binaural recording headphones can turn the verse into a wired microphone that will allow you to capture wired 16 bit 48 K wave files, to field recorders, DSLR GoPros, anything that doesn't have Bluetooth. Now we record wirelessly over Bluetooth using a proprietary codec that we've built from the ground up. That also allows us to stream dual channel 16 bit 48 K <span style="color:red" data-ts="151.165" data-end_ts="151.405" title="151.165" id=c_"151.165">__wave__</span> files over Bluetooth to iOS and Android devices. There's a reason you've never seen any Bluetooth microphones on the market before because there isn't a good Bluetooth recording codec. So, in addition to our headphones that are able to capture this audio, we have this codec that allows us to stream. We also have the world's first 3D audio recording mobile apps for Android and iOS that allow you to record straight to your phone, edit the content, apply filters, even share it within a public feed in the app. So a full mobile binaural 3D audio platform for, again, changing the way people record on their phones. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. And what does, what kind of price point does this thing come in at 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>The hook <span style="color:red" data-ts="189.885" data-end_ts="190.125" title="189.885" id=c_"189.885">__versus__</span> retail <span style="color:red" data-ts="190.525" data-end_ts="190.645" title="190.525" id=c_"190.525">__is__</span> for 2 39, we sell it on our site and through Amazon. And when you purchase it, it comes basically with everything your recording cable, six different size eart tips in silicone and memory foam, a pair of windscreens to go over the mics, which is super important for anyone outdoors. Recording action enthusiasts, charging cable carrying case. Even our shipping box converts into a little cardboard dummy head that you can put the verse on if you don't wanna wear them during the recording <laugh>. So it's a full sort of setup. <span style="color:red" data-ts="219.645" data-end_ts="220.045" title="219.645" id=c_"219.645">__Fucking__</span>, yeah. It's just sort of a fun thing. My, my good friend Jim designed it and we call it the gym head. Nice. People really love that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's pretty cool. Yeah. The idea of it being a wireless mic microphone and particularly one that can, that can handle, two channel and, and has any kind of fidelity at all is actually kinda surprising. And you say that you developed your, proprietary codec. What exactly is the trick necessary to make that happen? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>Yeah, definitely. So when you work in the world of Bluetooth, you know, there's a lot of off the shelf Bluetooth codex that allow for these devices to work. A very, very common Bluetooth codec that most, almost all headphones and speakers use on the market is called a two dp. And if they don't use a two dp, they use a PTX, which is a higher, you know, sampling rate codec. Okay. Now these off the shelf Bluetooth codex, what they do is they allow that phone to stream multiple channels of audio from the phone to a device, which is why we have Bluetooth headphones and speakers and all these things. And they're also set up to receive a single channel of audio mono audio, but it's optimized for the human voice. It's around three to five, you know, three kilohertz to five kilohertz. Right? Right. So that's why you have the headphones with the microphone. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>So there's never been a device that said, Hey, we've got two channels of really high quality audio and we want to push it to that phone. The phone doesn't know how to work with that. They've never been set up that way. It's not set up in the os. So we've built this codec that allows us to do it and right. And on the phone side, all it would need is like a simple line of code to integrate into its o operating system to use the native camera app, but instead it doesn't have it. So we use these mobile apps that make the handshake with our codec when it comes in. Does that 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Make sense? Very interesting. Yeah, it sure does. Yeah. Now, now let's <span style="color:red" data-ts="331.205" data-end_ts="331.365" title="331.205" id=c_"331.205">__talk__</span> for people. I mean, people can go to your website, which is hook audio, H-O-O-K-E audio. People can go there and take a, take a look at it. But, can you just like really quickly describe what, what these headphones and microphones, how they, how they fit on your head? And, 'cause I actually tried them at the, at the show and it was, it was actually pretty interesting because they weren't that invasive at all. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>You know, they're designed to really function like a sport headphone. Right. The mics in your ears are incredibly sensitive. So you can't have any kind of cable noise. You can't have any sort of interference from any of the apparatus during recording 'cause you're gonna hear it. Right. So they look like a standard sort of pair of sport headphones. You've got an earbud that goes in the ear, and then you have a memory wire that wraps around the back of the ear that goes to a module. And there's a module that sits behind both the left and right ear. On the left side, it's the biggest battery we can literally put on a human head without the FDA thinking. We built a bomb. 'cause it's super important, but it's a huge battery. 'cause you're getting like 10 to 11 hours of continuous record. And the right side is electronics. Then there's a cable that connects the modules from behind the head. So you can pop 'em off, put 'em around your neck, or you put 'em right in there and you're good to go. But they have to be, you know, accessible. They have to be portable, they have to be durable, and they have to be, you know, secure to the head 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right now. Did I hear you say that it was like 10 to 11 hours of, of recording time? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>Yeah. So we get about 11 to 12 hours of playback and about 10 to 11 hours of continuous binaural streaming, you know, as, as, as far as I see when I develop this. And I said, look, if someone's gonna buy this and take it to Coachella or Lalapalooza, and the, the verse dies before the headliner goes on <laugh>, I don't have a business. Right. Like, I straight up do not have a business. Right. So what I tell people is that your phone's battery will die three times before the verse does. <span style="color:red" data-ts="444.355" data-end_ts="444.645" title="444.355" id=c_"444.355">__Okay__</span>. The units that we were using at <span style="color:red" data-ts="446.275" data-end_ts="446.565" title="446.275" id=c_"446.275">__NAMM__</span> and we were demoing for 12 hours a day for four days straight, we charged each of those once during the show. Very, it was a big, a big important factor when I developed this. I, I come from a sound design and recording background and I know what battery is like. So I factored that in. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Let's, let's talk about that background a little bit because, I know when we had a brief discussion at the show, you you'd kind of described yourself as coming from a kind of unique, background and how that informed how you make hardware. I'd like to hear a little bit more about that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>Most of my training in audio is, coming from being a theatrical sound designer. I've been in New York for the last six or seven years before I started Hook audio working as a sound designer and composer, for theater. So I used to make the sound effects for the Broadway musicals. And when I wasn't working on the musicals, I was touring around the country writing original music and sound for plays and writing music and writing audio for theaters, whether they're 200 seat and then they move to 800 or they're 20 seat is a very unique type of creating sound. Right. You're very, very in tune and sort of attentive to how sound interacts in live spaces. So immersive audio <span style="color:red" data-ts="521.105" data-end_ts="521.325" title="521.105" id=c_"521.105">__has__</span> always sort of been at the forefront of how I've made and how I, I really think about sound. And when I was working in theater, you know, I I was very frustrated. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>It's probably not that surprising that, you know, I was coming up this against this wall where both my audiences and my collaborators, the people responsible for the art had very limited knowledge about the power that like really good sound story, sound can bring. And storytelling just, they didn't really understand it. They didn't really see how they could use it. You know, the director would go to the costume designer and the lighting designer and they would say, <span style="color:red" data-ts="555.985" data-end_ts="556.205" title="555.985" id=c_"555.985">__and__</span> they'd talk about color, temperature and saturation and brightness and contrast and all these things. And then they'd come over to the sound table and they'd speak to me and they'd say, you know, can we just put like a whoosh in there? Like, let's just, let's just end the act with a big old whoosh. We'll do a wind blow, we'll be good to go. And it's like, I felt like I was a wind blow man living in a, you know, a flat sound world. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>And I'm thinking here and it's like, I can't even get my audiences <span style="color:red" data-ts="579.445" data-end_ts="579.645" title="579.445" id=c_"579.445">__to__</span> care about sound. The problem is the directors and the producers who are cutting my sound cues don't either. Right. So it dawned on me it's like, why are they, why are they so focused visually? And I think, you know, like anyone, these directors, these producers that go home at night, they got a dimmer on the chandelier above their dining room tables. They've got that little green box on their phone that allows them to focus in on a specific element when they take a photo. They have these really well designed consumer visual tools in their consumer products. Right. But when it comes to recording sound, you just like throw a Hail Mary, you just like open the mic. It's like, oh, okay, I'm gonna capture this video of this Rolling Stones concert <span style="color:red" data-ts="617.905" data-end_ts="618.125" title="617.905" id=c_"617.905">__and__</span> it's gonna sound like a dump truck driving through a nitroglycerin implant. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>Because I couldn't even adjust the mic gain during the recording yet. I could focus, I could adjust the brightness, I could adjust the temperature, I could do all these things. And it's like, if we don't give consumers the ability to just change a little bit about how they record, I'm gonna keep making wind blows in theater <span style="color:red" data-ts="636.955" data-end_ts="637.245" title="636.955" id=c_"636.955">__till__</span> the day I dock. So it's like I have to make a consumer friendly device that gets people to be creative with this so I can stop making wind blows. And I was so frustrated by it coming from a theater background that I decided to launch a consumer electronics company. And that's where it came from, a pure desire for people to care about sound. And it has to start with them being creative. We have all these amazing solutions that let us consume great audio, got really nice headphones, got really nice Sonos speakers of the new Apple Home pod. But you know, sound has to go through a microphone before it goes through a speaker. And that's what we have to tackle first before we hit all any of these speakers systems. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure, sure. That makes a lot of sense. Now. Yeah. Before we, before we actually talk more about the mic, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="681.125" data-end_ts="681.285" title="681.125" id=c_"681.125">__wanna__</span> talk a little bit about the theatrical sound because, I'm, I'm a little curious, I've never really done any theatrical stuff before, but I, I wonder if one of the problems is that most people, when they think about like, sound that goes along with a play, all they can think of is sort of like radio plays. You know, where a guy Mm-Hmm. Honks a horn or does something like that, you know, and it doesn't, and it's not really conducive to sort of like the subtle use of, of audio. Like say we would hear in a, in a <span style="color:red" data-ts="717.285" data-end_ts="717.485" title="717.285" id=c_"717.285">__movies__</span>, in a movie soundtrack. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>Totally. And when it comes to musicals, you know, and why I don't normally work on musicals or when I was in theater is because it's a lot of technical reinforcement. It's about making things sound good. There's not a lot of art that comes from it. You know, when I was making sound effects from musicals, like on the Motown musical, I was, you know, putting in the sound cue that was like the record drop, you know, the needle on the record <span style="color:red" data-ts="739.915" data-end_ts="740.205" title="739.915" id=c_"739.915">__that__</span> was like the fuzz that came from it. It's like, you know, very utilitarian effects. But, you know, I've done shows like on the mountaintop at Arena Stage in DC that had this entire sort of 10 minute ending montage at the end, if anyone's ever seen that play. There's this big collage of things that happens <span style="color:red" data-ts="756.605" data-end_ts="756.885" title="756.605" id=c_"756.605">__where__</span> we can get shot into the future and sees the future. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>And we did this massive sound <span style="color:red" data-ts="761.525" data-end_ts="761.765" title="761.525" id=c_"761.525">__core__</span> with all these, or soundscape with all these samples and these cues that happen and they trigger and they fire and he talks over them and he talks under them. And it's this massive moment of light and sound that the actors sort of, you know, interact with on stage in this moment. That's where a lot of my passion lied with that. And, you know, sound design for theater has only sort of picked up and it's sort of, you know, formed this way in the last say, 10 to 15 years. They had a Tony Award for sound design. They actually got rid of it because the Tony Committee couldn't judge the awards. There was a huge, you know, criticism from that and a bunch of people rose up to fight that and they actually brought it back. But, you know, plays are where sound can get really creative and, you know, most of the, <span style="color:red" data-ts="803.825" data-end_ts="804.045" title="803.825" id=c_"803.825">__the__</span> music that you hear in, in plays is written by the sound designer. So it's all, you know, it's all created from the computer. It's all set up on a computer where a soundboard operator is up in a booth, is ready to cue it, and then they cue those sound cues from a computer, just like you would a lighting designer. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Interesting. So now getting into the idea of, of Binaural <span style="color:red" data-ts="828.165" data-end_ts="828.325" title="828.165" id=c_"828.165">__song__</span>, first of all, what is it about that work with theater that made you move towards playing with creating a mic? I mean, that seems still like a bit of a, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>'cause we used binaural microphones constantly. Oh, really? So my job a lot with the Broadway musicals was setting up the $9,000 Neuman head, you know, in row EC 17. Oh, of course. To record the show Sure. For archival purposes. Right. And that's all they were using it for. <laugh> was archival, basically to record the show. 'cause it's, you know, it's struck after, you know, two months of running. Right. So, you know, they used these big dummy heads and there was one moment where I was sitting on a Broadway house sitting right next to a dummy head in the seat next to me, completely alone in a Broadway theater. And I'm like, it's me in a dummy head right now. And I'm looking at this dummy head and I'm thinking, use your head, you fricking dummy <laugh>. Like, what are we doing here? Like, I'm literally at the same head spot as this dummy head and I'm sitting here doing this thing, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>It cost me $9,000. I've got all these cables going into these connectors. It's absurd. Right. So we used to use these constantly and you'd see how amazing it was was, and everyone would listen back and they'd be like, wow, this is incredible. And I'm, you know, I'm thinking how this one last step is missing to say, you can do it too. You can totally do it too. But you can't, with the current hardware out there, the binaural audio microphone companies, the bigger ones that are these expensive, <span style="color:red" data-ts="907.885" data-end_ts="908.085" title="907.885" id=c_"907.885">__that__</span> made dummies out of all of us. It's a mannequin head with microphones in it. Right. It can't be $8,000, but the only customer that's buying it are Broadway houses with sound budgets of half a million. So it's like, there's your market, there's your business, but the reality is, is our years do all the work. It's just placing the microphone in the right spot. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>So I, you know, I had firsthand experience with these mics. I used all of 'em. I watched single-handedly the reaction that people had hearing this and thought, this is absurd. It's such an amazing consumer experience. It's so fricking easy. Right. All you gotta do is put on a pair of headphones. You could open a YouTube link, you could open a SoundCloud link. Any headphones or speakers will allow you to hear binaural audio. Don't you think it should be just as easy to make the binaural audio? It has to any major format shift had devices that allow us to consume as easily as create. And so that's where the verse kind of comes in. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Right. Interesting. For our listeners are are largely gonna be artists and musicians and people who are creatives by nature anyway. Sure. What, first of all, so $239, how good of a microphones are these gonna actually be? And I mean, are they going to be able to be something that people can bank on from a creative standpoint? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>You know, I'm gonna be biased 'cause I invented this and I'm gonna say they sound incredible for the price. Right. But there are hundreds and hundreds of videos on YouTube posted by our customers, people that I have not paid in any way, who are simply customers who have reviewed the product, who have made their own content. I always tell people to let that be the judge. YouTube is very important for us, right. Because hearing is believing and you gotta hear the content. Sure. So we on our own YouTube channel have thousands of videos and playlists that we've either collected from our customers who have made content to stuff that we've made on our own to comparison videos to the other bin microphones out there on the market to really, you know, give people an understanding of what this really sounds like. You know, honestly, I would also have a lot of people review our press. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>You know, we've had some, some big press from some very sort of more sound music niche orientated articles, you know, who are all about the recording quality and, you know, judge their reaction, see what they say about it, and they say, for the price, this is incredible. This is what we need. So the factor is, is that most musicians still today are journalists are still using the built-in mic on their phone. Right. So it's like, if you're gonna buy a new pair of headphones, use these as headphones, but please stop recording at Mono Audio <laugh>. Do it some way better that allows your listeners to be there, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. From your perspective, one of the things that I'm interested in right now, now is, is there that there is actually kind of a lot of discussion about 3D audio, but it, it, a lot of it tends to be focused around how you're going to experience audio inside of like an Oculus riff, head headset or something like that. Yeah. Which is, which is kind of a different thing. But it also, it has this, it has this real kind of problem, which is that you have to be outfitted with $800 worth of stuff in order to experience the thing. Right. You're by, by focusing on binaurals, you are really, you are doing something with a standard set headphones really gives you pretty much the full experience. Not even, pretty much it just does. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>The, the same. I think problem facing VR video is the same thing that's facing VR audio, right? Yeah. The apparatus in which allows you to consume that content is a big leap for most consumers. It's a big sacrifice and commitment that people need to do. And just like any technology, it will go down and it will become more accessible and affordable over time. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Right. But right now it is still this sort of reserved sort of onboarding experience. Here's how I see mineral audio to fit into this. Right? So a lot of people will use a microphone called an ambisonics microphone that allows for head tracking audio upon playback and a sort of VR experience. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So if you've made, you know, AM's audio and you put on the headset and you turned your head, you'd have that audio move with you, great amazing experience gonna cost you $5,000 to watch like Donkey Kong and do that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>Who cares. <laugh> GoPro did something really interesting with the first camera that they had because I heard a lot of people talk about VR video when they first started watching it on headsets and saying this, oh, it's like GoPro video that you can move your head in. They're like, it's like GoPro video that I can move around in. And GoPro was a very important first step for a lot of VR video. 'cause it was this sort of immersive POV type of format storytelling that allowed you to really see the picture, but you couldn't move. It was like a passive vr Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> audio needs that first step. Audio needs the same sort of thing that go did for video. And that's binaural because binaural is a passive VR experience that doesn't require any onboarding on the consumption side to experience it. Just like a GoPro video can be put into YouTube and span your field of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1209.805" data-end_ts="1210.005" title="1209.805" id=c_"1209.805">__vision__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>So can a binaural audio file. But if I can't get people to care about binaural and buy a binaural microphone and start making <span style="color:red" data-ts="1217.345" data-end_ts="1217.565" title="1217.345" id=c_"1217.345">__in__</span> binaural and see why binaural matters, why the heck would they ever care about a $900 ambusonics microphone? Right. You know what I mean? Sure. So it's gotta have the same <span style="color:red" data-ts="1227.075" data-end_ts="1227.365" title="1227.075" id=c_"1227.075">__step__</span>, step of sort of education and knowledge that the the video do as well. And our biggest obstacle is, is getting people and makers and creators to understand why binaural matters. Why, why, why record this way? Why, why do it this way? And it's to say, well look, your listeners are already listening to your work on headphones. Most of the content you're making is from POB perspective. All you're trying to do is put your listeners in the room with you to, to have them be transported in your head so you can share them your story. It's a no-brainer. If you're gonna do immersive video, do the audio with it. And again, it doesn't have to have a VR headset <span style="color:red" data-ts="1263.145" data-end_ts="1263.365" title="1263.145" id=c_"1263.145">__to__</span> listen back. I don't care if you listen to binaural audio on your mono soundbar of your speaker, you know? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> it's still better than the built <span style="color:red" data-ts="1269.565" data-end_ts="1269.765" title="1269.565" id=c_"1269.565">__in__</span> mic. Right. It's just insane. We're walking around the world with like a handover one ear. It doesn't make any sense. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That's, that's actually a really interesting perspective. And, lately I like so many people I know have been doing more, location recording work. Yeah. And, that's one of those things where you, you very quickly, you, you get out in nature and you have microphone and you have, you put your headset on and it's always good. I think, I think for people who are getting started in location recording, they should plan on having abject failure for the first dozen times they go out. Right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> because Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you learn all of these things that don't matter in the studio, that become a big deal when you get out in the, in the field. Like, hey, if you have a microphone that's mounted in your recorder, the recorder body is gonna have a resonance and now you're gonna have this ring, you know, every time anything touches the body, that mic. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So you know, one, right. One whole recording session's gonna go in a tank because it's got this broadband tinging sound in it. Right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And then the next time you go out, you have your headphones in, you're enjoying it, but you're like, it's, it's funny because it seems like, boy, it's kinda loud. And then you'll bring it home and you realize, oh, well the cable kept on banging into the, you know, just scraping lightly against the microphone, which ended up, you know, in the studio now sounds like you're hitting your face with a shovel. Right. <laugh>. Totally. Yep. There's all that, there's all this kind of like, detailing that goes in. One of the things I think that you had to do with the design of this is you probably had to try and make it so that it took less than a dozen experiences to get a good recording. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>Totally. It takes one because they're headphones. You hear exactly what you're recording and not only are you able to adjust the level of what you're hearing, but you can adjust the gain of your recording. It's all within one device. You know, every microphone should have the ability to hear what it's recording immediately. And that's the beauty of putting mics <span style="color:red" data-ts="1396.485" data-end_ts="1396.605" title="1396.485" id=c_"1396.485">__on__</span> headphones. They just do that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So do you have a direct feedback from the mic and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1400.645" data-end_ts="1400.765" title="1400.645" id=c_"1400.645">__a__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1400.765" data-end_ts="1400.965" title="1400.765" id=c_"1400.765">__phone__</span> or does it have to go into the app and back out? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>No, if it went into the app and back out, we've latency, severe latency, right? No, it's all, it's all amplified right from onboard <span style="color:red" data-ts="1409.445" data-end_ts="1409.605" title="1409.445" id=c_"1409.445">__in__</span> the mics. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1410.305" data-end_ts="1410.525" title="1410.305" id=c_"1410.305">__And__</span> it's a, it's a transparent hearing function that allows you to basically have earplugs in and not get hit by a bus. 'cause you can't hear anything <laugh> if you're walking, which is super important. You know, our apps are also fully accessible to the blind. Blind people have been using Binal microphones for decades, but they've never had an ability to do it on their phone. So we partnered with the National Federation for the Blind and Perkins School for the Blind to make the app fully accessible to people, you know, visually impaired to use it. I've had blind people tell me, I can finally capture my home videos on my smartphones now with diverse, because it is, it's a camcorder for them. And so things like that, being able to hear what you're recording and to be able to adjust what you're hearing is a matter of life or death for these people. And it's what everyone should have. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I hadn't really thought about about the accessibility opportunity here, but that's pretty huge because like 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>A recording that lacks specialization that lacks, you know, directionality is completely useless to them. Right. And it was interesting, it was a huge challenge for us. Like how do you design <span style="color:red" data-ts="1469.935" data-end_ts="1470.285" title="1469.935" id=c_"1469.935">__might__</span> gain adjustment on a flat touchscreen app device. I encourage everyone to check out our blog, it's hook audio.com/blog. I have a bunch of articles about how we designed for the Blind. A lot of stories, a lot of stories from Blind Record us who are using it. But it sort of dives into how we made this completely accessible for the blind because it's essentially four products, right? It's one product when it's on iOS, one product when it's on Android than one product. When it's for blind people on iOS and one, it's Android iOS. I mean, it works completely differently when the microphone's clip the phone vibrates so that they know they have the abil ability to begin and end <span style="color:red" data-ts="1506.125" data-end_ts="1506.245" title="1506.125" id=c_"1506.125">__a__</span> recording by pressing the tactile power button on the verse instead of through the app if they can't find it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>Which cited people can do with the verse as well. But yeah, there's a lot of factors in there. Also, when I was designing this and I was seeking the guidance of like golden <span style="color:red" data-ts="1519.035" data-end_ts="1519.325" title="1519.035" id=c_"1519.035">__year__</span> producers to hear the clarity and the microphones the best feedback and the best years I've ever experienced, and I've worked in professional audio with film and theater for years, are blind people <laugh>. They have the most incredible years, literally like instinctually, right? That's what happens when you lose one of your <span style="color:red" data-ts="1536.245" data-end_ts="1536.445" title="1536.245" id=c_"1536.245">__sense__</span>. Another is heightened, right? They have incredible ears. I will never send a mix to a Golden Ears producer again. I will send it to one of the blind people that I've met through this journey, <laugh>, because they have the ability to hear anything. They found things that no one else I know with Eyes has. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's interesting. That's, that's amazing. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>Really quick, if you don't mind if I comment <span style="color:red" data-ts="1552.205" data-end_ts="1552.445" title="1552.205" id=c_"1552.205">__where__</span> you're saying, going out and recording what I think is interesting about this product and what it's causing people to do. We've had really amazing visual camera tools on our phones, and because of that, we pay a lot of attention to what we're seeing in the world. I think it's caused us to take note and, and look for more of those things. I've had a, I gave these 10 units to really big photographers who haven't done any sound recording to get their feedback on what they sort of experience going out when they go to shoot wearing 'em. And they said what the camera did for me to make me kind of open up my eyes and pay attention to what I was seeing your microphones are doing. Because before we weren't paying attention to what we hear because we know, even if we tried to record it, it wouldn't sound like we just heard it. But because now we have the ability in our pocket to actually capture what we hear. We're trying to pay more attention to what we hear to like capture that. You know what I mean? It works the same way. Sure. So I thought that was really interesting that I just <span style="color:red" data-ts="1607.885" data-end_ts="1608.045" title="1607.885" id=c_"1607.885">__share__</span>. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That's cool. Now you've gone from being a, a guy working in the theater to founding a hardware company. I mean, that is kind of a mind boggling jump, right? Because there's nothing else, the sort of like financial stake it takes to become a designer and producer of hardware. That's gotta be a pretty big hit. How, how big, how painful of a trek was that? How long did it take for you to get from like, okay, I'm gonna try this to, I've got a product. How long did that take you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>The beginning of 2014, I had a prototype relatively working that worked kind of wirelessly and kind of wired to be able to sort of transmit this to phones and wired devices. In the fall of 2014, I launched a Kickstarter for it to even gauge to see if enough people would be interested in, you know, something like this. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. The other thing, the other reason why I did the Kickstarter is because I knew early on in 2014 that immersive audio and 3D audio, it doesn't really factor out into ones and zeros for a VC on a spreadsheet. <laugh>, right? The guys that have the money that want to fund something like this, they're not gonna see any money in 3D audio because there isn't a guaranteed market. There isn't a prospering market. A lot of things hadn't been de-risked. So I said, maybe if I can de-risk the customer a bit and see what the demand is for something like this, it's a free, totally painless way to see if I'm about to, you know, the next four years of my life are about to be a waste <laugh> or something worth it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>And the Kickstarter did fantastic. You know, the Kickstarter, you know, tailored into a lot of, you know, audio professionals and makers for <span style="color:red" data-ts="1711.125" data-end_ts="1711.205" title="1711.125" id=c_"1711.125">__a__</span> long time, who knew what <span style="color:red" data-ts="1712.105" data-end_ts="1712.325" title="1712.105" id=c_"1712.105">__by__</span> audio was and hated that it cost $7,000. So the Kickstarter did well and it did well enough for me to sort of get the log rolling. Not enough to get big funding from VCs, but enough to sort of get individualized funding from friends and family Right. To basically get us to finish the product, to launch it and go from there. So that was, it's a thing in and of itself. I raised a good amount of money through friends and family to sort of push it this way. I mean, the big thing, I don't have any sort of engineering background. I don't have any coding experience. When I started this, I thought PCB was like a cleaning product. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>I didn't know it was a PCB board <laugh> a lot of things that I wasn't, you know, sort of attuned to. But what came back to it and the, the, you know, at the end of it about all of this is I knew what this needed to be. I knew exactly what this needed to be. I knew exactly what this could be, and I knew that if I could make it and I could make it this way and show it and put it on someone's head, they could see it too. And that's what drove me to, you know, enter so many black dark quarters that I have absolutely no experience in whatsoever, from managing people to managing assembly. I've done it pretty much all on my own. I flew to China two years ago and met with 10 factories completely on my own, trying to figure out how this works. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>And then I flew back to China at the beginning of 2017, lived there for two and a half months and oversaw mass production of our first run completely on my own. Not even with a translator because I couldn't fricking afford it. That's where I am in on this. And this is how I know I can make this. And because I've known how this can work, that's why it's here today. You know, we launched the Kickstarter, we do very well with it. In 2016 or 2015, mid 2015, we've got everything pretty good and ready. Like the product's working, it's all there. The mobile apps we go to submit them to the app stores, Google Play Store that submits the app, takes it back in like seven days and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1823.605" data-end_ts="1823.765" title="1823.605" id=c_"1823.605">__was__</span> like, great. This is good. Have fun, do whatever. Apple comes back and says, oh, this is a mobile app that requires a hardware. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>This hardware needs to be made for iPhone certified. This has to be an MFI certified product. Oh. And then for the next year and a half, two years of my life, I think just about two years from mid 2015 to the end of 2016, I went through Apple Made for iPhone certification journey. One of our biggest and most populated and and commented on blog posts is a full complete guide on how to get your Bluetooth product. MFI certified on my blog because I went through every step of it. And it is just as difficult and just as arbitrary and frustrating as everyone says it is. Everyone has gone through, like war with these guys. It takes forever. So when you get out, no one shares any other secrets. They don't want anyone to have an edge <laugh>. I said, screw that. This is not the kind of community I wanna be around. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>And I wrote a huge big, it was like no one would help me, so I'm gonna help someone here. But yeah, that process is totally insane. They, they, they provide no resources, no support. There's no direct contact to call. It's a single email bot. That's the only way you can communicate. You do a little bit of work, they take two to three months to respond. When they do, it's a simple note that you have to adjust a line of code. You send <span style="color:red" data-ts="1906.445" data-end_ts="1906.525" title="1906.445" id=c_"1906.445">__them__</span> back and you wait another two months. Oh man. And it almost feels like it's a way of bleeding startups to not be able to get it because they just can't withstand. So I had to move out <span style="color:red" data-ts="1914.965" data-end_ts="1915.085" title="1914.965" id=c_"1914.965">__of__</span> New York. I moved back in with my parents. I lived in their basement. I constantly worked on MFI for a year and a half, and it was finally able to get it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>Now the craziest part about it, at the end of it all, they were like, fine, we'll release the app into the app store, but we don't really consider this a headset because it doesn't have a three button array. Good to be the king, tons of moats to fight through. You gotta find a way to swim through each of the moats. I got through it. But that was the biggest arduous process of this. All you think making the products, difficult? No, that's the easiest thing. It's getting through the bureaucratic, you know, business, everything to get it through certifications. You know, you learn that certifications and all these things. They're just, there's like roadblocks put up by another company to try to keep their competitive edge over the market. Right. But I got through, I got through because I went all in and I've sacrificed pretty much my whole life for the last three and a half years to get where we are today. Wow. You know, and then we launched the product in the summer of last year and we saw four direct competitors come out right after us. Oh, Jesus. So, yeah. You know, yeah. It's been totally crazy. You know, you, you think if you went into this knowing what would happen, you wouldn't, but sometimes you just get too far into it and you're in it and you're like, well, not getting out. So. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Right. Well, it just seems like this, this really is, is a passion for you. But I gotta tell you, I, one of the things I was gonna ask was like how you assembled the team that did all this stuff. <laugh> it sounds like assembling the team was pretty much like, patting yourself on the back and saying, let's go. I mean, it sounds like, it sounds like you had a 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>It's bit there. There's definitely, yeah, there were definitely people that helped. There were definitely me and a handful of engineers who did all this. And it was just me being on the internet. Everyone has been hired through the internet. I've used, freelance hiring sites that have been my godsend. Upwork.com is this amazing site to hire freelancers. And I had a very good advisor early on that told me there's no reason to hire anyone on as a full-time employee from the beginning. Everyone is an independent contractor <span style="color:red" data-ts="2032.955" data-end_ts="2033.445" title="2032.955" id=c_"2032.955">__because__</span> no one will stay, no one will care about this as much as you do. Find a ragtag team, scrap it together. The internet is your friend. I mean, yeah. I launched a hardware and software business in the year 2018 and have raised all the money to do it, essentially straight through my cell phone in my parents' basement. Like, it's totally run that way. That's so that's like the tool you have to use. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well that's unbelievable. But also that's kind of hopeful for people that want to take something on. I mean, 'cause let's face it, a lot of times working on audio stuff is it has to start off as a passion project. Otherwise they're just, there are not the indicators. There's not the roadmap that tells you, you know, it's <laugh>. It's not like you're making military tooling here. Right. Where it's like clear that, oh, if you get something that a general likes, you're gonna sell 10 bazillion of 'em. Right? Right. Rather it's like, well, if you, if you are successful enough to capture the attention of the marketplace, you're gonna be selling this to people who are scraping money already. You know, so on, on the surface, it, it seems like kind of a tough sled to, to get into play on it, but it just definitely seems like you've got the passion necessary to pull that off. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>A lot of people will say nothing great comes in under three years. Right. And if it does, it means the market is already validated and there's already products out there. If you really want to do something, if you really want to make it new, it's gonna take three to five years. And depending on the industry, the three years might be building the product. The other three might be just getting the customer. The reality here though, and I am like a perfect walking example of it, and I try to express it to as many entrepreneurs as I can, you just have to keep doing it. Like I was the kid waving this 3D audio flag, you know, know in the corner since the early 2014 when, you know, the Google ad spend on that word was like a penny <laugh>. Now it's at like $3 <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>You have to keep saying it. You have to just keep saying it. And if you keep saying it, eventually people are like, well, he keeps saying it, so he must be doing something. All right, I'll click the blog post. Right. You know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2155.785" data-end_ts="2156.005" title="2155.785" id=c_"2155.785">__you__</span>, we have this tendency to just like fizzle out to, like, especially when you're on the internet, it's all this content being pushed. I mean, I gotta post, I gotta post blog posts seven times in a day before I know someone reads it. You have to be persistent. And you know, look, if you talk to me during this Apple MFI certification process, it was morbid because it was like, I made the product. I know this works. The product is beautiful, the app works. I'm going to die because a big business doesn't want me to succeed. That's when I felt this feeling of like, even as hard as you work, even if you put everything into it, there's still gonna be someone that doesn't care or doesn't allow it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>But the reality is, is if you keep pushing it and you find a way they can't not not allow it. Right. And so it did that and I kept at it and I kept doing it, and it shows it, it really, really does. Now granted, I'm still trying to educate the market on binaural. I'm still trying to see why <span style="color:red" data-ts="2207.645" data-end_ts="2207.805" title="2207.645" id=c_"2207.645">__people__</span>, why it matters. I've now got a direct competitor in So Heiser, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2212.045" data-end_ts="2212.245" title="2212.045" id=c_"2212.045">__so__</span> Heiser ambi headset, which is a wired <span style="color:red" data-ts="2215.115" data-end_ts="2215.405" title="2215.115" id=c_"2215.115">__mine__</span> roll mic with headphones. It only works on iPhone. It's completely less versatile than ours. It also costs a fortune. But they got a million dollars to spend a month on marketing. Right. So, you know, you feel like, oh my God, so Heiser just rented a double Decker bus in London and they're showing their product. How can I compete with that? I can, there's ways that there's places that Sennheiser isn't, there's all these things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>So every time when you feel like there's something bigger on it, you just have to say that you, you can and there's gonna be people that you're <span style="color:red" data-ts="2242.925" data-end_ts="2243.005" title="2242.925" id=c_"2242.925">__it__</span>. And if you keep doing it, it does every time. I've had so many, you know, moments where <span style="color:red" data-ts="2247.765" data-end_ts="2247.845" title="2247.765" id=c_"2247.765">__I__</span> like, I've done everything. And it's not a, it's like I wish I did something wrong. It's actually that I did everything right. And there's these bigger powers you push through the powers you really can, it might take you a little longer, but you can, and I'm, I'm proof of it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So when someone like Sennheiser comes along though with a competing product, I mean other than just saying, well I already got my frigging money poured in it, so I have to stick it out. How do you basically mean get or maintain an, an advantage over them when you are up against bucket loads of money? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>So, I mean, first of all, our product has a serious advantage over it. Like I said, it's wired. It only works on iOS, doesn't come with a carrying case, doesn't have windscreen, doesn't have anything. We're compatible on every device. We're wireless. We do everything. We're much more versatile. So there's a confidence that I can instill to know it's like their product isn't better. They're just, they're just known more. I mean, it's, it's crazy. It's been a long, it's been a multi <span style="color:red" data-ts="2298.765" data-end_ts="2299.085" title="2298.765" id=c_"2298.765">__chapter__</span> journey with them. Right? So when they first announced they first launched, they acted like I didn't exist <laugh>, they acted like they knew nothing about me. And they did all these paid sponsorships and these paid posts and these, these paid ads and paid reviews claiming Sennheiser to be the world's first 3D audio product, the the world's first 3D audio recording headphones, which of course they weren't. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>So I bought a ticket to every conference that Sennheiser was demoing at like a ES and CES went into the booth and recorded it with my headphones with Hook first and was like, Hey guys, I'm wearing it. This is doing it. You guys haven't been <span style="color:red" data-ts="2331.645" data-end_ts="2331.765" title="2331.645" id=c_"2331.645">__having__</span> it out here. 'cause I know you haven't shipped yet. <laugh>. Then I wrote a blog post about it and I showed the videos of what I was doing there, and I showed receipts of shipping. Then I started, you know, commenting and reaching out to every single journalist that was making these claims, collecting the data on it, getting them to openly admit in text format that they were being paid to write these reviews and make these claims even though they didn't do any research. And I wrote a blog post about that. I then sent three units to the CEOs and founders of, you know, Daniel and Andrea son Heiser, and you reming the head of their <span style="color:red" data-ts="2361.395" data-end_ts="2361.685" title="2361.395" id=c_"2361.395">__ambi__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2361.685" data-end_ts="2361.765" title="2361.685" id=c_"2361.685">__O__</span> 3D audio line. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>I physically sent them units of tracking and I have a shipping confirmation that says they received it. So it's like, I know you got the unit, let's talk. What's the feedback? I've spoken on the phone with you Reming a couple times. We've talked about them making the claim to first you'll notice they don't really make that claim anymore. That's mainly because I've trolled the heck out of journalists and doing all this <laugh>. There was a post that recently came up this week. I had to reach out to them. They took it down. So yeah, it's a lot of that. It's a lot of like, they're just acting like we don't exist, even though I've spoken with them directly, but, you know, they know that they have a lot more money than me. They can push it. But the reality here, what's happening is the biggest obstacle all of us companies are facing is, again, what you're saying in the beginning, why does RAL audio matter? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>Why should people use it? Because if we can tackle that objective and people do care about making binaural audio and they Google what is binaural audio, and they see the Sennheiser and they go, Jesus, I wanna use this on my Android phone, they buy my product. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2419.615" data-end_ts="2419.965" title="2419.615" id=c_"2419.615">__Right__</span>? So what's that phrase? All, all boats rise with the tides sort of thing. I need more of that. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2426.685" data-end_ts="2426.845" title="2426.685" id=c_"2426.685">__Right__</span>? I need more people creating and, and capturing and binaural because I've got the product that will work for all of it. And you know, and I can be places where Sennheiser isn't, they can't be everywhere. There's, and there's gonna need to be competitors in the space. And that's good and that's fine. And I have no issue with what they're doing and I'm thankful for what they're doing when they make claims about being the first and all that stuff. It's kind of weird, but it's part of the process. That's a great thing. If no one, I want Sony to be putting <span style="color:red" data-ts="2452.045" data-end_ts="2452.245" title="2452.045" id=c_"2452.045">__ral__</span> mics in their headphones. You know, I want every company to have bin mics in there 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Because Yeah. It makes it so that, that people start expecting that. Right. I could see that. Yeah. Well <span style="color:red" data-ts="2462.265" data-end_ts="2462.485" title="2462.265" id=c_"2462.265">__now__</span> it's, it's interesting though because what it seems like too is you are kind of embracing, something that we're seeing again, for a long time, this was gone in, in the music gear world or the sound gear world, which is sort of like the punk, the punk businesses, right? There was a while where everything kind of just got super corporatized and, and then all of a sudden whether it's, you know, if you're into synthesizers, it's all the, all these nuts doing modular synths. Right? If you're into guitars, it's people that are doing hand-painted pedals or whatever. And you know, in the case of of audio gear, it's things like peculiar microphones, right? And it's sort of like, basically, not only is it the microphone, but it's people saying, getting in front of you and saying, I dare you to tell me why this isn't great. And I have to say, I really respect that about what you're doing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>Well, thank you. I I very much appreciate it. And it comes from a place of, of just knowing that if people put this on, I can get it on a person's head. No one hears this and goes, nah, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2527.905" data-end_ts="2528.125" title="2527.905" id=c_"2527.905">__nah__</span>, it's okay. Like, whatever. Like, no one's like, nah. Everyone's like, holy crap, I didn't know this existed. And then I have to be like, yeah, binaural audio's been around since the late 18 hundreds. So, you know, I know that if I can get it on people's heads, I can do it, but no one else does. Which is why I can't get any sort of big support or major funded right now. But if I can do it long enough and I can get it to enough people, you know, our big thing is trying to figure out how can we scale that demo that you experienced <span style="color:red" data-ts="2552.605" data-end_ts="2552.805" title="2552.605" id=c_"2552.605">__at__</span> namm Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>On the internet, right? How do we get that to blow up from the internet so people can see it? So my main objective right now is getting people to talk about binaural, to get people to share their content. I mean, we're, we have a, we have hundreds and hundreds of hundreds of, of customers using the product every single day, and how do we get them to share that so people understand that and it can scale. I mean, that's, that's what we're really trying, but I appreciate it. Thank you. Yeah. I would love some funding, but yes, I get it. <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You, you, you're, you're happy to be a punk, but you wouldn't mind having, being a punk with a wallet full of cash, right? <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>Yeah, I'm happy to be, I'm happy to be not dead yet. <laugh>, that's all. I feel like this is, you know, you end it today and I've, I've gone through a ride that I, that most people dream of and would, would, would try to work towards. I'm thankful for every moment of it, because there's no better feeling than making something great for the world. It's just really, it's what I've always wanted to do. So, yeah. That, that and alone is its payment, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, I know this is gonna seem like a poking the eye, given that you just have this product out for a short period of time. But I have to ask what's next? You know, obviously you, you are passionate about a binaural audio. What do you do in terms of, whether it's hardware or software or, or product of whatever sort? What's, what's next for hook audio? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>Yeah. You remember I was saying before the verse kind of captures what I say is like a passive VR experience. It's this immersive audio, but you're <span style="color:red" data-ts="2640.645" data-end_ts="2640.845" title="2640.645" id=c_"2640.645">__fixed__</span> to the head of the record when listening. Right? Right. So just imagine the experience where you, you're not fixed. Ah, using the same hardware in the mobile app that you have. Be able to listen back to something and, freely move and interact with it just from your phone. That's where we're going because no one wants to put on a fricking VR headset. Right. I'm so tired of VR headset. There's so many other ways to be immersive without Yeah. Looking like a terminator. Yeah. Well this is, so that's where we're gonna push, but it's always gonna be through creation. There's gonna be some new hardware, but it's, it's, it's gonna be even, you know, like I said, binaural <span style="color:red" data-ts="2673.365" data-end_ts="2673.525" title="2673.365" id=c_"2673.365">__is__</span> the first step. The other steps are what we're gonna tackle as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2677.945" data-end_ts="2678.165" title="2677.945" id=c_"2677.945">__All__</span> right. Very cool. So for people that want to, that want to check out both, your products as well as, some of the examples, where's the best place for them to look? 
</p>

<p>

Our YouTube is very important from demos to reviews, to comparisons, all those things. And then our blog is very informative too. I read, you know, two posts a week on our blog. All things spatial audio, 3D audio, all of those things. I encourage to purchase it straight through the site. And I would also like to offer, a special discount to anyone listening on this. They can purchase it to get 10% off. The verse online. Can we do 10 off Darwin? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>10 off Darwin? It is, yep. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>One zero O-F-F-D-A-R-W-I-N. If anyone has gotten this long through my, my rambling <span style="color:red" data-ts="2737.085" data-end_ts="2737.285" title="2737.085" id=c_"2737.085">__and__</span> recording <laugh>, you deserve a, a, a tree. So that's what you can get forgiveness. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>All right, great. Well, Anthony, I want to thank you so much for taking time outta your schedule and talking us through <span style="color:red" data-ts="2747.585" data-end_ts="2747.805" title="2747.585" id=c_"2747.585">__by__</span> audio a little bit, but also about your, path. It was really interesting to catch, catch a glimpse. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Anthony: </b>Awesome. Thank you so much for having me, Darwin. I appreciate it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2756.245" data-end_ts="2756.605" title="2756.245" id=c_"2756.245">__Alright__</span>, we'll talk soon. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Many thanks to Anthony for having the chat and we're filling us in not only about his passion <span style="color:red" data-ts="2773.825" data-end_ts="2774.045" title="2773.825" id=c_"2773.825">__and__</span>, in creating binaural microphones, but also his passion about building a company and all the difficult negotiations he had along the way in order to get it going. It's really interesting stuff. I hope that you take the opportunity to go over to hook audio.com, check out the work that he's been doing, check out some of their examples, and, learn a little bit more about what they're doing. Thanks again for listening, for tuning in this week. Thanks for, sharing Our numbers are a really good place. Let's continue to get people involved. Also if you could jump over to Facebook and just give the page alike. We have an art music technology page. It always is looking for a thumbs up now and again. So thanks, again for all your help. We'll be catching you again next week.
