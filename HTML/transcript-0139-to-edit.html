<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, today we are going to spend a little time, with an old friend. We first interviewed him and on podcast number 23. So we, you'd have to go back in the way back machine a little bit to catch that interview. But his name's Mark Mosser. He's, in addition to being a friend of mine and also being a collaborator on the, the No Poem musical Adventures, he is a very active synth guy. He does a lot of tutorials. He does a really popular blog. He does a pretty popular podcast where he does soundscapes and compositions. But what we're gonna talk to him about today is something very specific, and that is his role as the creator and maintainer of the Rocky Mountain Synthesizer Meetup. So that's the, that's the map of today. Let's start off by saying hi to Mark. Hey, mark. How's it going? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark Mosher: </b>Hey, Darwin How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm doing great. Thanks a lot for being willing to spend a little time today. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Yeah, yeah. Happy to talk. And also talk about the meetup, 'cause it's been, quite a ride. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, it has been. One of the things that's interesting is that practically, anytime I speak to somebody in the Denver area, they talk about how they've been influenced by your meetup. You know, they've either met people or they've used it as a launch <span style="color:red" data-ts="106.985" data-end_ts="107.205" title="106.985" id=c_"106.985">__pad__</span> to start to start doing more performance or to get involved in a group. You know, it came up when we talked to <span style="color:red" data-ts="115.765" data-end_ts="115.885" title="115.765" id=c_"115.765">__D__</span> Ode, you know, that's how he got to know a bunch of people that ended up being part of his fluxx Mob Fluxx crew. Fluxx crew. That's it. <laugh> Fluxx Mob actually would be a great name for it maybe. But anyway, I know. So, you know, it, it keeps on coming up with people in that area. And I wanted to talk to you about it because, you know, with my recent move to Minnesota, I've gotten a chance to drop in on a number of different meetups. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And quite frankly, I got used to the, your Rocky Mountain Synth Meetup and how well it was coordinated and how it was organized. And it seemed like I wasn't getting that from some of the meetups that I attended here. And so, I want to talk to you a little bit about what the history was for the, for your synth meetup, but also, you know, get some tips and techniques and ideas for how you make a successful meetup. So Sure. That's sort of the plan. Why don't we start off by having you tell us, give us the history of the, of the Meetup. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Okay. Well, it was, founded in, June of 2012, if you can believe it. And, I, I had, before the meetup, I had been involved with other, with other user groups in meetups. So I had been in the, Ableton user group, which was started in 2009 and went to maybe about 2011. I had been in some other massive meetups in Boulder. Boulder's a real startup town, so there's a meetup called Boulder, Denver New Tech. And, you know, very, so, so I had some to meetups and maybe how to organize things. And, but sort of the genesis of it really was, I'd moved to Boulder in 2004 and had been here a number of years, and I was having, I was just shocked. I'd bump into someone, just somewhere and they would tell me, do you know, so-and-So they live 10 minutes from your house, and they, they're into synthesizers. And I'm like, no, I don't know them. How, how did I, how do I not know these people? And, and I was kind of trying to like network through coffee meetings, and it was really difficult to find people. And, funny story, I was out playing at the, Asheville Electro Music, and, that's where I met Mike <span style="color:red" data-ts="247.775" data-end_ts="248.125" title="247.775" id=c_"247.775">__Meley__</span> for the first time, face <span style="color:red" data-ts="248.925" data-end_ts="249.045" title="248.925" id=c_"248.925">__to__</span> face. Oh my goodness. Yeah. He <span style="color:red" data-ts="250.925" data-end_ts="251.045" title="250.925" id=c_"250.925">__lose__</span> like 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>10 minutes from you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Yeah, he is like 15 minutes from my house. And, here I am at this <span style="color:red" data-ts="255.685" data-end_ts="255.845" title="255.685" id=c_"255.685">__Meet__</span> <laugh> at this event that he's like, oh, yeah, I live, I live just down the road from you. And I'm like, all right. I've gotta do something about this <laugh>. So anyway, I started thinking about trying to do, you know, one of the things I liked about the Ableton user group was the, just the people and sort of, but, but one of the downsides of doing a meetup that's focused on one technology set is, it is just <span style="color:red" data-ts="276.305" data-end_ts="276.525" title="276.305" id=c_"276.305">__to__</span>, that's a good thing, if you're just in that group. So I felt I wanted to create a more of a community that was about connection, in general about synthesizers and music, and music art, and, using computers and hardware. And I, I felt like being, just tunneled into one product was just too tight. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>I thought I, it, it would be, because mainly what I wanted to do is find, find people, connect people, have people inspire each other. So it would sort of lift up the community in a way. And I just felt I wanted to do, more broader ideas. So, so that was like the first step. And, as I was thinking about that, I actually saw since Toia, I think, posted a video of <span style="color:red" data-ts="314.475" data-end_ts="315.285" title="314.475" id=c_"314.475">__Lori Anderson__</span> doing a commencement speech at the, New York Soul of Visual Arts in 2012. So in this video, she mentions Tom Hodgkinson, the guy who wrote the book, being Idol. And, yeah, I thought her speech was quite inspiring. And part of that book was like, what's work? What's play? So I went out and I bought his book called The Freedom Manifesto. And this book had a chapter in it called Stop Competing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>And at the end of every chapter of this book, there's a called action. And at the end of this chapter, stop competing, there was a call to action that was Start a guild Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And it was this whole idea of starting something where at the point of it wasn't competition, but cooperation and how could you lift yourself up? And so then I started thinking about, well, it probably better be better to start something where we talked over a beer or food or something. So that book really kind of informed the decision to make it a really, like more of a drinking club with a synthesizer problem or an eating club with a synthesizer problem, <laugh>. 'cause I felt that would be social, right? That if you're breaking, having a drink or, or isn't about the alcohol, but just being together and consuming food and sharing that experience is a real icebreaker. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>And it'd be really different from all the other meetups I'd been to. That was sort of the genesis of that, that book, seeing Lori Anderson's, commencement speech tied in with this sort of need to maybe create a networking community that was a little different. So that was the, the genesis of it. So I thought, okay, this is great. I live in Lewisville, Colorado, just outside of Boulder. I'm gonna call this thing 'cause I want it to be broad. The Boulder Synthesizer meetup at the time. And I said, I need a place that has beer and food and that would allow people to come in and make noise with synthesizers. In my town. There was this, little restaurant called The Old Lewisville, and they had a room in the back, and this is gonna be one of those key features of what makes a meetup successful. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Synthesizer meetup is having an isolated room from the rest of the venue, and they basically said, bring some people down, thirsty and hungry, and you can use the room for free. And I thought, okay, I'm gonna start this meetup. I'm gonna give it a broad name, the Boulder Synthesizer meetup. And I kind of expected maybe six people to show up, right. Just because of my connections with other meetups and just being in the community. Some, I think we probably had 14, 15 people there that night. You were there that night. Is that what you remember? About 14 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Or 15? Yeah, something like that. Right, exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>It was really great. And I think people all sort of got the idea of this more general meetup where we rotate themes. So that night we had these 14, 15 people show up and, we had set up some synths, and I think I did something. So then that was the first meetup. And, that was in, I think June 11th, 2012. So started with 14 people, and then I put the meetup, on meetup that the meetup was on meetup.com. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And that's how, that was. The, that's another crucial point in the success of this was using meetup.com and not just Facebook for this or something. So from there, it started, you know, people thought that was pretty great, and they started connecting and talking, and we said, let's do another one. So I think the other thing that made this successful was we decided to do it consistently same day of the second Tuesday of every month. Same place <span style="color:red" data-ts="509.245" data-end_ts="509.365" title="509.245" id=c_"509.245">__o__</span> Louisville <span style="color:red" data-ts="509.925" data-end_ts="510.125" title="509.925" id=c_"509.925">__in__</span>, and we put up the meetup.com page and, people started finding us and word of mouth, just from those 14, 15 people started going out, and then we continued on from there. So that was the very first meetup and sort of the genesis of the meetup and, you know, sort of having, having it be very social. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So, a couple of questions about that. First of all, well, one of the things that I remember, first of all is an incredible, an incredible widespread of people. Now, you said that you kind of got it kicked off by, you know, people you knew, but as I recall, it was either the first or the second meeting was people like, Chris Larky showed up, right? <span style="color:red" data-ts="554.465" data-end_ts="554.685" title="554.465" id=c_"554.465">__Yep__</span>. Who, and in fact, I like infected him with the modular thing because I think this was it, the second one where you had me bring my modular in and make a bunch of squeaky noises. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Yes, I think so. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And, you know, it, it like totally infected him. But then shortly thereafter, you did one where Victoria Lundy brought <span style="color:red" data-ts="574.725" data-end_ts="574.845" title="574.725" id=c_"574.725">__a__</span> thein in, and all of a sudden people were hyped on Thein. I mean, it really opened up some doors for people. But I, it's hard for me to imagine that you like knew all these people because there were like, from crazy edges of the world. I mean, Chris Larky had started off really just doing like Nintendo based music stuff, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Right? So I didn't know Chris at that. It's a really good point. You mentioned it because there were people at that very first meetup who I didn't know and who saw it, the meetup page. And, but <span style="color:red" data-ts="605.405" data-end_ts="605.525" title="605.405" id=c_"605.405">__I__</span>, I think another catalyst for this was the fact that I had been blogging for, at that time, six or seven years on Modulate This. I had <span style="color:red" data-ts="613.565" data-end_ts="613.685" title="613.565" id=c_"613.565">__a__</span>, a companion Facebook page for that. <span style="color:red" data-ts="616.505" data-end_ts="616.725" title="616.505" id=c_"616.505">__So__</span> I had some <laugh> friends of friends and people I had never met who maybe I were acquaintances <span style="color:red" data-ts="620.845" data-end_ts="620.965" title="620.845" id=c_"620.845">__of__</span> on Facebook. So I started using social media, Twitter and Facebook, as well to, as well to sort of say, Hey, we have a meetup going. And then that sort of cast a bit of a net and people who I didn't, so it was kind of a mixture of people who I knew on social media, but maybe barely had never met Face-to-face, or people maybe like Chris Bulaki, who you knew or, and, and some others who I didn't know at all who happened to see the announcement on Twitter. So, then it started, you know, building out from there. And I, I, like Victoria's a great example. I had known her on Facebook for a few months and never met her. And then we did a theorem <span style="color:red" data-ts="654.645" data-end_ts="654.765" title="654.645" id=c_"654.645">__and__</span> themed October event for Halloween, and she came out and I met her, and then they've been to every meetup since, right? She <span style="color:red" data-ts="662.445" data-end_ts="662.565" title="662.445" id=c_"662.445">__and__</span> her husband Tom. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, they've become a real, kinda real staples of the whole electronic and experimental scene in the Denver area. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Yeah, yeah, that's right. So, I think that's one of the huge benefits of the meetup is even early on people started meeting, they said, Hey, maybe we should join forces and try to pull a show together. Did you know about this show next week in Denver? So this sort of networking started happening. And for example, with Victoria, I think I met her in October. And, we started collaborating on things within a month or two. And so, so it's sort of a combination of all these events. Without the internet and social media, it wouldn't have, we wouldn't have been able to sort of cast that wider net 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right now, one of the things that happened is after a little while the old Louisville Inn actually, closed down in order to be remodeled, or it was bought by somebody and you end up having to change venues. And, and this is kind of important because one things I've noticed is in general, meetups don't actually survive a change in venue. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Yeah. I've seen that as well. If the venue changes, then the meetups gone on. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. The meetup falls apart, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Yeah. So, I think that what happened for us is that was a bit devastating 'cause we really liked it, <span style="color:red" data-ts="738.765" data-end_ts="738.925" title="738.765" id=c_"738.765">__the__</span>, that that backroom was sort of like being in your some 1950s basement or something, right? <laugh>. Right. So, so, so there was, except it had the old tin tile ceilings from the 18 hundreds. 'cause it's a coal mining town. And, when that, when they, when they remodeled, they shut down very quickly, like the day before our meetup and people still showed up and stood outside the doors and met <laugh>. They were so, they were so into the meetup, they're like, we're gonna do something right. And, you know, I just sort of showed up at the door <span style="color:red" data-ts="768.595" data-end_ts="768.885" title="768.595" id=c_"768.595">__soon__</span>. Somebody didn't get the email that we canceled, but, you know, a whole bunch of people came. So we said, well, let's all go out to dinner. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>So <laugh>, we had this sort of meetup anyway, where we all just popped to a local restaurant and, and had dinner. So I kind of knew at that point, you know, I better keep going with this. People are anticipating it, they're looking forward to it. They, it's becoming part, they're into it. Yeah. They're into it. It's becoming part of their, their social lives and as well as also maybe an inspiration for, and also a way to connect and, and to talk about work. So I thought, well, I better get in another venue. So, there was another member, Greg Kennedy, who is a teacher, speaking of like a wide variety of people. We can maybe get into that in a minute. But he was a teacher who was using Ableton and STEM schools, and he knew of a venue in the next little town over. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>So for those who aren't familiar with this area, you have Boulder. And then, little towns that were coal mine towns surrounded by open space. So we have Boulder, Lewisville Lafayette is the next town over. We found another venue and they were kind of in the same boat. They had three meeting rooms and they said, Hey, bring people thirsty and hungry and we'll let you use the room for free. So we moved to this place called 95 a bistro, and we were there for almost a year. And the meetup continued to grow. Having that <span style="color:red" data-ts="843.485" data-end_ts="843.605" title="843.485" id=c_"843.485">__I__</span>, again, the, again, the formula was isolated space, consistent, second Tuesday, same time, and using social media and then having people network and word of mouth. So, you know, it just continued to grow month after month after month. And so yeah, we survived the venue change. We've survived the venue change, I think four times now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? Well, but each time it's kind of come at almost an opportune time because the move to 95 A was at a point in time when you had pretty much outgrown that basement room at the old Lafayette Inn. I mean, it was fun to be there. Yeah. But it was also starting to get a little like sweaty smelling <laugh>, you know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>It was a little gamey down there. Yeah. A 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Little gamey. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And so this place was bigger. It had a place where you could, you could sort of do a projection system and it allowed for maybe a little bit bigger format of a discussion or of a, of a demonstration. I mean, in a way it was almost like moved from being a discretion group to being like a demonstration thing. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Right. So, you know, we did have demos in the first one, but it was pretty tight and cramped. Right. But when we went to 95 <span style="color:red" data-ts="917.605" data-end_ts="917.725" title="917.605" id=c_"917.605">__a__</span> bistro, we could actually set it up. They actually had a screen we could use. We started doing, I think, emphasizing a little bit more the presentation side of it, in that room. And people could all hear and be very comfortable sitting around these tables and, be in this space. And I should mention that one of the other reasons to, if you're gonna do a, a synth meetup, you have to be self-contained. 'cause you can't count on the venue. But the 95 Bier, bier had a screen and we showed up once in the screen was broken. So, 'cause I do interactive visuals in my show. I have a projector, I have a screen, I have a, a little Bose L one compact in case, of emergencies. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>I <span style="color:red" data-ts="953.765" data-end_ts="953.885" title="953.765" id=c_"953.765">__have__</span> a little mixer, a little Mackey. I have, you know, cables I bring. So when I load in, it's like the Sherpa load in. I bring a bunch of stuff, I end up using three quarters of it. If the venues system fails, I end up using all of it. Right. So we're completely self-contained. It's like pop-up meetup at this point. And it was very early on. I can actually kinda remember I tried to make a <span style="color:red" data-ts="973.045" data-end_ts="973.165" title="973.045" id=c_"973.045">__re__</span> a series of screens to work in the, old Louisville <span style="color:red" data-ts="976.765" data-end_ts="976.925" title="976.765" id=c_"976.765">__in__</span>, I was hanging, you know, sheets and trying to do all this stuff about, cut my finger off, trying to make a frame for that. So, I switched to the, screen, the venue. It was kind of organic, right? It all sort of was working together. We outgrew the <span style="color:red" data-ts="991.135" data-end_ts="991.485" title="991.135" id=c_"991.135">__other__</span> room, we lost the room, we went to the bigger room, had the bigger screen, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. And then from there, the next step was to move to the Walnut Room, which is kind of a historically important venue in the Denver area for performance. They've been around for a long time doing hosting performances for a lot of people. But what was unique about that was it actually had a performing stage. It had a sound man and all that kind of stuff. And again, it seemed like, well, first of all, why did you get booted from the 95 A? Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>In that particular case. And, and this is my advice to other people doing meetups, I think I, they had renovated that restaurant and they were trying to grow the business and the bus. And, and I don't begrudge people for what I'm about to tell you. I'm just telling you, this is the reality. So when you have a venue that's kind of friendly and they say to you something like, if you come down, you can use the room for free in exchange for bringing people thirsty and hungry in <span style="color:red" data-ts="1044.405" data-end_ts="1044.525" title="1044.405" id=c_"1044.405">__other__</span> hungry, in other words, for exposure, I'm bringing people into their restaurant. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="1049.085" data-end_ts="1049.245" title="1049.085" id=c_"1049.085">__then__</span>, and then people come back and buy meals later. And by the way, we would always say that, you know, if you were in the meetup, we thank the sponsor of the room and say, make sure you come back and support these folks. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>'cause they're giving this room for free. But in <span style="color:red" data-ts="1060.165" data-end_ts="1060.285" title="1060.165" id=c_"1060.165">__the__</span>, in this particular case, they had gotten busier and there was more competition for the rooms. The, the Optimist Society, for example, was opposite us many nights, <laugh>. Oh, right. And, then they started getting near the holidays. So the room, the room is a, is a revenue generator at some point. And when the room becomes a revenue generator for a venue, you're probably not gonna last long unless you're gonna pay. Right. So we sort of got, we got into that position where it is getting a little awkward, and I don't begrudge them for it, I'm just, it's just a fact they could generate revenue from the room and they couldn't continue to have us use the room. So we moved on and, and survived that one as well. But as you said, it was an opportune move because we ended up moving to a bigger venue. Yet by then, now the meetup had grown to maybe 110, 120 people in the meetup with meetup sizes ranging from 15 people in the summer when it's kind of hot up to 30, 35 people Right. Jamming into this room. And so the move to the Walnut Room was significant because it can hold 120 people. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. And one of the things I remember about relatively soon after the move to the Walnut Room is when you really had a big event, which was, the Ableton live launch for, I think it was the Push two launch, correct? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Yes. Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative>. Yeah. That was, a stunning number of 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>People. <laugh>. Yeah. So let <span style="color:red" data-ts="1140.645" data-end_ts="1140.765" title="1140.645" id=c_"1140.645">__me__</span> just back up a little bit on the Walnut Room. So I have to mention somebody along the way, as you're building a meetup and the meetup's growing, you're building connections with people who then become supporters of the group. They, they actually want you to succeed. So I, I have to give a shout out to Randall Frazier, who was booking the Walnut Room. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And he also was the one who got the original Ableton user group into that room way back in 2010. I can't say enough about Randall, he firmly firm believer in the notion of a community like this. If you can imagine, they traded that room for us, bringing people thirsty and hungry, and gave us a sound man every night. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="1178.705" data-end_ts="1178.925" title="1178.705" id=c_"1178.705">__the__</span> those guys got into it and, and, you know, super professional, you know, nobody was phoning it in. They're up there, where do you want the mic? What's gonna happen? Do you wanna use the projector? I mean, it was unbelievable. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And, it was <span style="color:red" data-ts="1190.845" data-end_ts="1191.045" title="1190.845" id=c_"1190.845">__this__</span> pro of a performance environment as I'd ever worked, and they were just handing it over. It was amazing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Yeah. So, anyway, that I, I, I have to give a shout out to, Randall Frazier for that, for sure. And he's been a friend of the meetup and as was the Walnut Room. I just wanna, maybe we should talk a bit about the, I think one of the things that made the meetup grow that changed a little when we went into the Walnut Room was the format of the meetup before we went to the Walnut Room. And originally the format was, I had a schedule, so everybody knew what was gonna happen. I'd put it up on meetup.com, and in the beginning it was 30 minutes, show up, get some, get some food and drink, sit down, everybody has name tags. And I thought, is this gonna work? It might seem, a dorky right to have name tags <laugh>, a musicians meetup. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>But the, remember the goal and the objective, rather with the meetup, was for people to connect. So, so we had name tags. One of the ways I, kind of promoted the use of the name tags. Initially I was doing giveaways, so I would number all the name tags. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1251.725" data-end_ts="1251.885" title="1251.725" id=c_"1251.725">__would__</span>, and, and if you wanted to be in a chance for the running, for the giveaway, you had to have a number, which meant you had to have a name tag. So early on that was sort of the motivated people to put the name tag on. And then after a while, it just became how we do it, right? So we had na we have name tags. So that's the first 30 minutes you sort of get in, orient yourself. Next we have a lightweight presentation, with a rotating theme every month. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>And that would go for 45 minutes to an hour. So I think you once told me this, that, you know, people, Dr you know, we were doing these things seven o'clock at night on a Tuesday when we were in Boulder. People were driving from as far away as Colorado Springs, Fort Collins. Some people were coming in from Canyon City driving two hours to come up to the meetup. And so, you're kind of toasted after that, or even if you commuted across Denver before they finished the US 36 expansion. So people, it was really great to come in, kind of get a glass of beer or a drink, and then have this presentation <span style="color:red" data-ts="1307.085" data-end_ts="1307.245" title="1307.085" id=c_"1307.085">__and__</span> with a rotating theme. And, another commonality of this format was these presentations were from within. As the group grew, we had this amazing demographic of software engineers, professional musicians, hobbyists, teachers, writers, you know, amazing demo, you know, mixture of people. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>And, we would come up and rotate these presentations so that, you know, part two would be the presentation. And then after that, we, everybody introduced the, every single one of them, if you could imagine. So we're <laugh>, we go through this, get do the, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1336.765" data-end_ts="1336.925" title="1336.765" id=c_"1336.765">__get__</span>, get your beers, sit down, have a light presentation that's hopefully somewhat inspiring. Not necessarily completely educational, but maybe it's somebody's work. And then we go around the room and you say, what's your name? Where are you from? What's your rig? What do you wanna learn? Or what's your next project? Something that simple. And you go for maybe one minute. So we go around the room and everybody introduces themselves and you can see their name tags, right. And we get to the end of that, and then we kind of do this like, you know, 1, 2, 3 break, and then everybody mingles and the whole room lights up in the original format. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>You'd close out the night with everybody just talking and mingling. And the din went way up and people were connecting, and it was incredible. Right? So that was the original format that we used for almost two years. When we went to the Walnut Room, as you mentioned, that had <span style="color:red" data-ts="1381.885" data-end_ts="1382.085" title="1381.885" id=c_"1381.885">__an__</span> amazing stage. So I thought, man, we, we'd really be foolish not to add performance to this. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1387.975" data-end_ts="1388.325" title="1387.975" id=c_"1387.975">__Right__</span>? So we had a meetup that went from seven to nine, and then we started doing what we call the after meetup. And that was from, nine to 10 30. And we had a performer on the big stage with the full PA going from nine 30 to 10, just one of those 30 minutes <span style="color:red" data-ts="1404.155" data-end_ts="1404.445" title="1404.155" id=c_"1404.155">__dead__</span> sleep, people wanting more. Again, we were able, bring people in from, you know, within the meetup and let them perform. Some people had never been on stage. Some people were seasoned and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1413.045" data-end_ts="1413.245" title="1413.045" id=c_"1413.045">__were__</span> just trying out a new way to do something. Some people started in the meetup like two years before, had never performed live, had gone from knowing nothing about synthesizers to buying interesting rigs to perform live in front of their friends. So it was an amazing way to close the circle. Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>One, one of the things that I was always curious about is if you ever felt like having that performance time actually hamstrung people making the connections, it's sort of like the bustle to get, to get a performer up, got in the way of people interacting? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>I don't think so. I think that if you, you know, if you, if you run the clock on this second format, you know, you show up at seven, you get a something to eat, something to drink, it's now it's seven 30. We do a little bit of an intro, you know, we do our light presentation, then we do our group intros. And then it was, I don't think the performance was ever a barrier. And if anything, it was more of a, again, a conversation starter or an inspiration. Some people would say, oh, wow, I didn't know you could use this that way. And then Right. We'd start a whole nother conversation. What was the barrier though, to the social networking aspect was just simply growth? Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That was the other thing I was gonna say, because at some point I think you stopped being able to do the everyone talks thing because there were just simply too many people 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>We're, we're, so we're at the walnut room and we have capacity for 120 people uncomfortably, but you know, you could do it. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And the meetup starts to really grow, right? We start, we break 200 people to 20. We're just adding people all the time. And the meetup size was going from averaging 15 to 30, like 35 like we were doing at the 95 A to 15 to 55. Right? Right. So the, the events were getting bigger and bigger. So what we started doing is for those events, we would do, have the new people introduce themselves and have people stand up and do announcements who had gigs coming up. Or if you heard a new person introduce them, introduce themselves, and you thought you had something you could help them with, you might stand up and introduce yourself. So we kind of did a, an abbreviated introduction. I think that the maximum, you can really do this, everybody introduces everybody else. And this format is about 35 people. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1561.115" data-end_ts="1561.405" title="1561.115" id=c_"1561.115">__Then__</span> it starts falling apart, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Huh? So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Mm-Hmm, <affirmative>. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So that, that on the nights when that happened, and it wasn't every single meetup, we would do an abbreviated introduction. Okay. It didn't really change though. What happened after the introduction people would, 'cause at that point, now we're two years in, right? People, it's on their calendar. They're looking forward to it. They're coming down to talk to people. And, and, and the, it's such a, again, the goal was no competition, but to sort of have a, it's not a zero sum game. We wanted to have a way for people to connect. So people who had been, who were seasoned will, would go out and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1594.985" data-end_ts="1595.205" title="1594.985" id=c_"1594.985">__if__</span> they saw somebody new, they would go talk to them. It's incredibly friendly and powerful Right. To have a a, a base of 120 people with maybe there's a core of 30 people or 10, 20 people that come every time. And when they see a new person, they go talk to them and bring them in and introduce 'em to somebody of a similar interest. So I still felt like a, after the, in abbreviated introductions, boom, the whole room would light up and the din would go up. And that never changed, even though we had abbreviated introductions. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So in your experience, what were the things that got the most activity at the, at the meetup? I mean, certainly something like this, push <span style="color:red" data-ts="1633.265" data-end_ts="1633.485" title="1633.265" id=c_"1633.265">__one__</span>, push two release, which was sort of a organized event, brought in a lot of people. But in general, what were the things that drew people in? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Yeah, so I had, so how, how this planning goes is that we rotate <span style="color:red" data-ts="1647.725" data-end_ts="1647.845" title="1647.725" id=c_"1647.725">__a__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1648.005" data-end_ts="1648.125" title="1648.005" id=c_"1648.005">__a__</span>, a new theme every month. And I would sort of read what happened over time and historically and try to also correlate that with time of year, like if it, was <span style="color:red" data-ts="1655.965" data-end_ts="1656.085" title="1655.965" id=c_"1655.965">__it__</span> hot out, that sort of thing. Was it nice and sunny in Colorado when people were out biking? Right. So the meetups that were bigger tended to be bigger, were more general, more less educational, less prescriptive, less, esoteric. That would be one type. And the other was, anything related to, Ableton or anything related to modular <laugh>. So if I had a few, yeah. If I had a few, slow months, and, and by the way, I don't mind having a slow month. As I say, even at this point, if, if one or two people show up and wanna sit down and have a beer with me and talk about the synthesizer, I'll still go down. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Right. Right. So, I will take risks <span style="color:red" data-ts="1692.665" data-end_ts="1692.885" title="1692.665" id=c_"1692.665">__to__</span> put <span style="color:red" data-ts="1693.445" data-end_ts="1693.565" title="1693.445" id=c_"1693.445">__in__</span> something I think might be interesting people have never heard of. And I'll sandwich it between something that is gonna be maybe, more general or more popular, because I, you know, part of this is to be exposed to new ideas. So, for example, Tim Thompson, who invented the space palette and who's worked with, you know, on Roger with Roger Lynn on, on Coating some things, flew all the way out here to show us the space palette. Nobody knew what that was and never heard of it. And he flew all the way out just to come to our meetup. And I was able to host him. And, you know, for those meetups, you may not think you might wanna come to that, but people come and they see it. I had, a Langdon Crawford who teaches at NYU and lives halftime in Colorado, do a, a talk on his, work on gestural hand controllers, which he'd been working on for quite some time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>I actually first met Langdon at the, Margaret Guthman instrument competition in Georgia Tech. And I saw, like, his first controllers were wood blocks with like rubber bands, <laugh> <laugh> with, I don't know what controller was in it, but, you know, I thought, okay, this is a little esoteric. I know it's not gonna be as big as maybe a modular meetup, but people came and they really enjoyed it. So I'll take some risks to promote people within the community who have, ver very respected work and interesting ideas. Right, right. So, so on the, on the more of the vendor side of things, you mentioned Ableton. So in, last November, I guess it was, Ableton was about to launch Live nine, five and push two. And I had gotten to know them through just my work on my blog. And, and through the meetup some of the members, you know, had been in contact with them. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>And so I, I had, also done some of the university tours for Ableton. So I had a relationship with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1799.525" data-end_ts="1799.685" title="1799.525" id=c_"1799.525">__them__</span>, and they reached out to me and said, you know, by then we had, I think, 320 members, last fall. And they were like, Hey, we, we'd love to host your meetup. We're gonna buy everybody pizza, and we're gonna come out and we're gonna launch push two in Colorado at your meetup. Would you, would that be okay with you? And I'm like, that's fantastic. You know, why not? So, we blew the <laugh>, we blew the room out though. Everybody was so excited about Push two, and they able to themselves promoted it. And we had our largest meetup ever at, I think we were at a hundred and ten, a hundred and fifteen, a hundred and twenty people. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That was pretty much capacity for that room, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Yes, it was. Yeah. That's crazy. So, so yeah, I mean, quite a, quite a journey, right? To go from the old Louisville where you have, you know, 10 of us, 12 of us sitting around drinking a beer in the sweaty basement to the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1854.145" data-end_ts="1854.365" title="1854.145" id=c_"1854.145">__old__</span> Walnut Room with a full PA with 120 people in it who wanna see Ableton's latest release. Right. So I always kind of, I joke that it's like the little meetup that could, we <span style="color:red" data-ts="1863.605" data-end_ts="1863.765" title="1863.605" id=c_"1863.605">__sort__</span> started getting a reputation, right? Right. People would, like, Arturia came in, they happened to be in town at Guitar Center doing some training, and they had the prototype for their first mini <span style="color:red" data-ts="1875.275" data-end_ts="1875.565" title="1875.275" id=c_"1875.275">__brew__</span>, which hadn't been released yet. And they heard we had a beer and a meetup. So they came out and brought the prototype over. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm trying to think, you had, Bert from Audio Cubes out once, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Correct. So, Bert from Percuss, who makes, the Percuss <span style="color:red" data-ts="1890.375" data-end_ts="1890.495" title="1890.375" id=c_"1890.375">__a__</span> audio cube, came out to, recently he was in, doing a little tour of, of the prototype for his next modular synth, which is based on the audio cubes. And he, he flew in and, part of that tour and picked our meetup as one of the stops where we got to see it. So, Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know, so we, we've had guests like that. We've had Tim Thompson, we had Bert, we had, Steve Turnage from Seattle who wrote the book Desktop Mastering Skyped into the group. And I, I was <span style="color:red" data-ts="1922.495" data-end_ts="1922.655" title="1922.495" id=c_"1922.495">__at__</span> a, that was actually at the old Louisville, and they had a great internet connection, and I set up a high deaf camera and a mic, and Steve did basically walked us through, mastering a track, and people got to walk up to the mic and he could see them. It was like he was right there and ask him questions about mastering. So, yeah, we've sometimes had special guests like that. Uhhuh <affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Did you ever worry about, about looking like you were too closely tied to any one company or any one technology? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Not really, because we would rotate. Like we'd have big Ableton meetup, and then the next meetup would be like a drum machine shootout. Right. So. Right. We didn't really, it wasn't, it wasn't a focus. We're always clear about that Ableton's gonna be in the house, they're sponsoring this meetup. Isn't that awesome? Right. So, and then most meetups are just not like that. Totally. So I think it's a, it's a matter of not doing it too much. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, of the things, I mean, we've talked a lot, a lot about the things that were successful. I'm curious about what were things that were not successful, what, what are sort of like anti-patterns that you'd want to pass along to anyone else trying to do a meetup? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>One would be, as you say, would be to maybe to get too close to a particular vendor or sponsor. I think one of the reasons our meetup is successful is that it's, it's user, it's community funded. It's free, it's always been free. I pay the meetup fees, I ask for a dollar donation, and it's optional. So if you're a little, if you don't have a dollar, that's fine, come to the meetup anyway. And so because it's community sponsored, and I don't take money from general other than maybe giveaways or something, we're not beholden to anybody for picking topics. So I don't feel like I have to pick a particular topic 'cause of a connection from, a donation or from a vendor. And, and I'm very clear about that with vendors if they want to come to the meetup that, you know, that just doesn't work that way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>The other thing is, I'll just mention Ableton, is favored in some ways. It's just 'cause of the demo. I started running demographics. I, I, I can export where, you know, basically, your zip code and what your interests are, you can sign up and tell, say what your interests are. And probably 60% of the meetup is maybe a little more Does Ableton. So if we do an Ableton or does modular, what else doesn't work? I would say, live, trying to demo hardware with live cameras is difficult. You have to really practice. You have to practice a practice it a lot. So if somebody comes in and they haven't practiced with a live camera, how they're gonna do their presentation, that might not go down so well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Have you ever done like, recordings of the meetups for sharing? Or is that something, or are you trying to force people to show up at the venue? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Yeah, we, I discourage recording or any sort of live, broadcast of it other than if someone's performing and they, they'll, it's, it's their discretion for the after meetup. Someone, you know, sometimes people love people to shoot videos so they can have a copy for their archives and help them with social media. But, it recording the, the meetup would sort of like being, going to a party at somebody's house and then using Periscope. Right. It would just be rude <laugh>. So. Right. You know <span style="color:red" data-ts="2106.475" data-end_ts="2106.765" title="2106.475" id=c_"2106.475">__what__</span>, what's great about the meetup is you can have really direct conversations. It's, it's a social hangout, and so there's nothing really to broadcast. Even if somebody does a presentation, it's a little loose and they feel comfortable. So even when people have visited, it's just not like you're an academic setting where it's really dry or they're presenting it in such a way that it would be compelling after the fact. So one of the other reasons I started the meetup is, we are all connected, most of us on Facebook and Twitter, but there's just not as much bandwidth to that. Right. So I, I wanna make it worth your while to come down. I want, I want the venue to be nice. I want, you know, there to be other people there. So if you don't come down and you miss it, you miss it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Are, are you still doing them at the, at the Walnut Room, or has it moved again since then? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Yes, we, we've moved again and, that was we, Randall Frazier, who had been fantastic with the meetup was kind of building a new scene in Denver at a place called the Globe Hall, and it's on the outside of town. So again, this is how it goes, right. These venues start to Denver's being gentrified a little bit, and the dynamics are changing while the room's still great, still has a great pa. But one of the things we started realizing is that now we're up to 480 plus people, right? The meetup's big. So we can maybe help build, scenes and help build awareness around scenes that would help people have places to perform. Right? Right. So it's kind of, getting to the point now where Randall was like, Hey, I've got this new venue. It's a little bigger <laugh>, it has a great pa, it's got a separate room. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>They'll, you can have it, you know, for free as long as you bring people hungry and thirsty, and would you like to give it a shot? Right. So now he's asking us, would we take a risk on him? He took a risk on us, right? So, I said, yes, let's move it. So, we moved it and now we're at this new venue we're meeting coming up <span style="color:red" data-ts="2213.585" data-end_ts="2213.805" title="2213.585" id=c_"2213.585">__on__</span> in August. We're, we're gonna do like an Ableton Link jam there. And, you know, I'm, I'm going for the record, I don't know what the record is, but we're gonna try and get 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> Oh, the, the record for people on an on a Link session, you mean? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Yes. Yeah. That's what we're gonna go for. So, so anyway, yeah, we moved again and, but the formula's the same. Right? Nice room. They have food and drink, they have a isolated room. They have a pa they have a, and they, in this case, they have a sound guy again. So we're, we're, we're sticking, we've been there three months now with <span style="color:red" data-ts="2242.325" data-end_ts="2242.485" title="2242.325" id=c_"2242.325">__this__</span>, the same format, meetup and after Meetup. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, our, our time is <span style="color:red" data-ts="2247.645" data-end_ts="2247.845" title="2247.645" id=c_"2247.645">__out__</span>. We're burning through the time quickly here, but there's one thing that I think anybody who's considering doing a meetup has got a wonder, which is that you've been doing it for a while now. How do you prevent from getting burned out? How do you make it so that you don't get sick of it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Yeah. Well, I would say, there's a couple things about it. One is, it's, it does become difficult at some point to come up with the new themes all the time and to keep the group going. And especially now that we're four years old. So one of the things I'm doing now is skipping some months so that people still anticipate it. And also it helps me concentrate the group a little more. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2286.465" data-end_ts="2286.885" title="2286.465" id=c_"2286.465">__Denver__</span>, you know, by the way, we changed the name when we moved to Denver to the Rocky. It used to be the Boulder Synthesizer Meetup, and now it's the Rocky Mountain Synthesizer Meetup. And we <span style="color:red" data-ts="2296.285" data-end_ts="2296.485" title="2296.285" id=c_"2296.285">__change__</span> by changing the name, we change, you know, we're up and down the front range. If you look at our demographics, we have people again up in Fort Collins, Boulder, Denver, Colorado Springs. So, I think that, I, I would say leaning even more towards keeping the presentations general. We did a, we did a, really great, I called it sort of a lightning round modular shootout. So we're kind of experimenting with the format, so it's a little less lecture and a little more, more people participating. So in that particular scenario, people would come up, they would take a picture of their modular projected on the screen, go through their patch, and I had a clock running. They got, five minutes, I think it was to get to the past. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I was, I was a participant in that. It was unnerving a little bit, but it was cool. Yeah.

<b>Mark: </b>So then it becomes a little more like a game show. It's a little more snappy. Right. It's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2342.725" data-end_ts="2342.805" title="2342.725" id=c_"2342.725">__a__</span>, the other part of it is now it's not all me, right? It's not me deciding <span style="color:red" data-ts="2346.345" data-end_ts="2346.565" title="2346.345" id=c_"2346.345">__all__</span>, all I have to do is kind of come up with the idea and engage the community. And for me, how I'm keeping it fresher is I'm doing more events where I'm counting more on the people in the meetup to, to, be a part of it. For example, this Link Jam, we're, we're gonna do a little bit of an intro on what, what able <span style="color:red" data-ts="2362.525" data-end_ts="2362.685" title="2362.525" id=c_"2362.525">__to__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2362.685" data-end_ts="2362.805" title="2362.685" id=c_"2362.685">__Link__</span> is all about. And then it's all, it's gonna be as many people as possible in that room participating. So I guess what one way to prevent from Burning out is to mix it up with events where somebody isn't even presenting, but it's a, it's a full on community event. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Right, right. I, I know we're, we're kind of, been going a while here, but I, I do want to give a shout out to Victoria and Tom Lundy who've helped a lot with the meetup. They, they're with Cuddle <span style="color:red" data-ts="2387.645" data-end_ts="2387.765" title="2387.645" id=c_"2387.645">__Fish__</span> Arts. They, when we were growing to a certain point, we decided to make a logo. So they've made logos for the Meetup and that have been fantastic. People like Mike <span style="color:red" data-ts="2395.915" data-end_ts="2396.205" title="2395.915" id=c_"2395.915">__Mele__</span> and and and yourself have helped me come up with themes. Mike actually hosted a meetup 'cause I couldn't last year. So, you know, the community, I just, you know, my biggest thanks is to the community because, it, it's just an amazing community. And anytime I think about like, well, maybe we should, you know, we've been doing this a while, what's the value? We'll be at a meetup and someone new will introduce themselves and they'll say, they'll be, they'll sit through the introductions, they've never been there before. And they'll stand up and say, I've been looking for a group like this my entire life. Like, no kidding, right? I've been in my basement with a synthesizer and, I'm home. Right. That's an amazing thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, I'll tell you, one of the things that, you know, I, I actually hold really dear is someone like, like Chris Sessions. So Chris Sessions I met in some of the earliest meetups he had bought, an Access virus. He was learning how to use it. He was doing some basic stuff. I hung out with him a little bit, showed him a couple of things, but he just came and absorbed things constantly. Right. And you could see him sort of like growing over time, to the point where just before I left Denver, he actually, he actually did the thing where he performed, at one of the meetups. And it was Right. It was an amazing thing because you saw the growth that, that he went through, obviously, you know, with a lot of his own effort, but also was sort of like the interaction with the whole community. It was pretty amazing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Yeah. And I think that, you know, myself, I, I think it's more the norm now that people end up as a result of the, the Meetup performing more or collaborating more or getting involved with collaborations. And Chris is just a great example of someone who started out and kind of, he was already an artist in his own right. With photography and, you know, amazing 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Photographer. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And then he sort of came into his own, through the connections in the meetup and his own work and got to perform. So he's an example of someone who came full circle. And, you know, that's a pretty amazing thing to be able to provide. Right. To have a meetup, to have a place where you can do it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>To sort of bring things around to our own full circle. If you were going to, you know, let's say you're like me and you moved, or, or something happened and you found yourself in a different situation, and, you were either going to start a new meetup or you were gonna help someone else start one mm-Hmm. <affirmative> what, what sort of represents the starters kit of stuff to do stuff to read people to follow? How, how would you do it? What, you mentioned this book by, Hodgkiss that the Freedom Manifesto, which was kind of influential. Is there, is there other things that people can read for inspiration? Is there other hints about, you know, like, have these kind, these bits of gear before you even get started to, to really help people have a chance to succeed? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Yeah. So if I were just to summarize it, it would be, be general, have a name that's general. The names are really important. Use meetup.com. 'cause meetup.com will allow people to find you. Facebook is, is you just need to have a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2594.525" data-end_ts="2594.725" title="2594.525" id=c_"2594.525">__pr__</span> sort of a presence on Facebook that matches the name for some people that use Facebook. But I can't, I, I can't tell you how when people rsvp on meetup.com and managing those meetups and managing name tags and RSVPs, it's just made to do that. And when you use meetup.com, the, the, the, the, the, the number of people that actually show who RSVP that the ratio is very high. You know, if you, you only lose maybe 10, 15%, whereas on a Facebook invite, you're lucky to get 10 <span style="color:red" data-ts="2625.105" data-end_ts="2625.325" title="2625.105" id=c_"2625.105">__or__</span> 15% depending on the event, right? So meetup's crucial and it helps people find you in the area. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>And, then I would say for a synth meetup, 'cause you don't know what's gonna happen with the room, you have to have, some kind of a way to amplify sound. I use the Bose Compact, L one compact. You could use just some monitors, something. So if the room is dead, you can do your thing, right? You need to have a projector in a screen and a webcam that could be used for presentations like a Logitech C nine 20. And I can give you show notes on this stuff too as well. But, you know, you need a webcam, you need, maybe a couple of extra cables in case someone forgot one. And, those are, those are like the basics. And you need to, I think, start with a format maybe that's similar to ours, and then work it depending on the vibe of your group. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>And, and I'll give you an example. I've shared this information with some others like Jeremy de Prisco who's out in Pennsylvania and he has this Susquehanna Experimental Music and Sound meetup. So they're going, I shared this last year with Jacob Waters, who now works for Roland, and he started the Toronto Synth Meetup and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2694.435" data-end_ts="2694.725" title="2694.435" id=c_"2694.435">__fall__</span>, you know, sort of taking our format as a template, right? And they started their meetup in May, 2015, and they have 231 members. Wow. So what I would say is start the meetup <laugh>, there's a paradox of what can I, what should I do? And the answer is start it, name it, get the Get Your Land grab on meetup.com and maybe a Facebook page. Right. And start having events in rooms that will, that will work for free. And, make it a free event. And don't, don't try to mingle in paying for a fee-based event with a free event. Just keep it free. 'cause it'll just confuse people. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Very good. Well, thank you so much for taking the time and, and talking about this. I think, I hope it inspires people because I, I just know that the Boulder and then Rocky Mountain Synth Meetup was super influential to me. It was a great, I met so many amazing people there, and I'm hoping that people use this as maybe a stimulant or, or an opportunity to think about doing meetups for in their own community. Because if nothing else, the opportunity to meet new people, to perform with new people is amazing. And it's something that's not to be missed. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Yeah. And I guess I would close with thinking about this. This is not a zero sum game. And if there are, even if there are other meetups in your area and you think you can add, create a community that might get a few people to come out, do so, but, you know, cooperate with the other communities, as you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2786.025" data-end_ts="2786.245" title="2786.025" id=c_"2786.025">__or__</span> people may not know, but in Boulder's very vibrant as far as meetups and such. And there are similar meetups that might be specific, like Ableton user group in Boulder. We're extremely friendly amongst each other. We invite each other to our groups. We'll, we'll let people stand up and announce their meetup with an our meetup and vice versa. So I think that it's about sort of raising the water level in your community, so all the boats rise higher and you don't get competitive about it. And you, you cooperate and don't think of it as a zero sum game, then the whole community wins and it becomes more vibrant. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Indeed. All right. Well thanks a lot man, and we will talk again soon. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mark: </b>Okay, thanks Dar. Alright, bye bye-Bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Many thanks to Mark for getting together and talking about the meetup. My experience with the Rocky Mountain Synth Meetup is that it was one of the strongest and most interesting meetups I'd ever been around. So I want to thank you for that. And I wanna thank you for listening and for hanging out with me another week. We'll see you next week. Bye.
