<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. This week I have the pleasure to introduce you. Hopefully, hopefully not for the first time to an artist I really admire. His name is Tony Gerber He is, he just makes wonderful music. It's, it's a very soulful kind of space, ambient music. I just find it wonderful. And, he is, he's been doing this kinda stuff for a long time, and rather than kind of <span style="color:red" data-ts="41.785" data-end_ts="41.985" title="41.785" id=c_"41.785">__filling__</span> all the blanks, I'll let him do it. So, with that, I say welcome to Tony Gerber Hi Tony. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony Gerber: </b>Hey, Darwin I'm doing great, and thanks for asking me, asking me to do this. This is <span style="color:red" data-ts="52.705" data-end_ts="52.905" title="52.705" id=c_"52.705">__what__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="52.905" data-end_ts="52.985" title="52.905" id=c_"52.905">__was__</span>, it's kind of a fun thing. I was, <span style="color:red" data-ts="55.265" data-end_ts="55.385" title="55.265" id=c_"55.265">__I__</span>, I don't think I'd mentioned this, but I grew up with a Darwin Gross, so it's funny 'cause it's, I kind of got it mixed up. <laugh>. I kind of got you mixed up for a little bit, because I was thinking it was that person, but really, yeah, yeah. Actually in northern Indiana, but, the gross family Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's crazy. Because, I mean, the only other one that I knew of was the head of the <span style="color:red" data-ts="77.055" data-end_ts="77.345" title="77.055" id=c_"77.055">__Akin__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="77.405" data-end_ts="77.625" title="77.405" id=c_"77.405">__Car__</span> religion. They're like a soul travel joint. And the leader for a while was named Darwin Gross. And they even contacted me because at some point he had a vision about, Darwin another person coming in and working with him. But then all of a sudden he kind of got caught with his fingers in the till or something, and he was out and there went my chance for great religious glory. Right. <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Sorry, I sidetracked this there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>No, that's pretty interesting. I, I, I have to look this up because I've never heard of another one other than this one guy. So, anyway, thanks a lot for being on the, on the podcast. I am, I personally am really excited about this because I've, I've long really enjoyed your music. For those listeners who aren't familiar with you, why don't you give us a kind of a quick overview and talk a little bit about what you're, the kind of stuff you're doing now? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Okay. Well, I mean, you know, I'm in my, I'm in my fifties and I, I mean, I started doing, actually doing music in the late sixties and got into electronic music very early at about 10 years old. And, you know, played in the bands and did different things and, but I was, I was always interested in electronic music and, and sounds, so, so <span style="color:red" data-ts="155.785" data-end_ts="155.905" title="155.785" id=c_"155.785">__I__</span>, you know, I've kind of created, created my own niche of, of, space music, ambient mixing with some acoustic kind of electroacoustic ambient space. I guess. It's hard, you know, the terms are terms are squirrely. I mean 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, they're pretty strangled. You're right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>I mean, I, you know, I was influenced a lot by the Kraut Rock and, you know, the early electronic stuff, even the academic stuff. So I'm kind of coming from that. So when, when the new age terms and all that came around, of course, you know, that was a category, but that's not really where my inspirations lies. So, but anyway, I, you know, pretty early moved to Nashville, Tennessee, and I've actually been here about 35 years. And of course, skirting around the outside of, of, all of, you know, what people think of as Nashville. But actually, you know, there's every style of music here that you can imagine. So it's been a good place to, to, to base myself out of. And I explore some, I, I explore a couple other styles of music. I have a couple guitar albums out. I have a blues band called, cotton Blossom Band, fairly recently. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Actually my album last year, soul Shining With That Band was a top, 10 album for Nashville and the surrounding state area from one of the publications here. So, you know, I've explored different stuff, but definitely my heart lies with space music, and, you know, you would hear my stuff on Hearts of Space or Echoes. I mean, I've played up there for John Deo and his living room concert. Right. You know, done the Gathering series a couple times. And, but, I really like to do this stuff live. So that's, that's part, that's part of, you know, part of my niche, I guess, is a lot of people don't do this kind of music live. And then more recently, like in the last 10 years, I've gotten into the virtual world, which I'm sure we'll talk about. And I have a whole persona in there and kind of a whole career virtually in there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>But, I, you know, I've done it, I've been doing music since I was seven years old, and it's, and it's part of, it's just part of who I am, part of my wellbeing. And, but then it's great that other people can get benefits from it as well. But I, I have kind of a holistic look at it, I guess, you know, I mean, it's, there's something very, very relaxing about my music, even <span style="color:red" data-ts="307.405" data-end_ts="307.645" title="307.405" id=c_"307.405">__when__</span>, even when I'm trying to do something a little more edgy, it's still, there's still some kinda liquid type of quality that's even on rock kind of stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Yeah. Well, it's, it's funny because it seems like, some of the people that I've talked to about you speak of you in almost shamanistic terms. And it's funny that you brought up the New Age thing because while, while that relaxing quotient is there, and while you use some of the instrumentation that's typical for new age stuff, I tend to think of your music as being more dark and maybe broody. And maybe it's just because that's, that helps you get it outta your system. I don't <span style="color:red" data-ts="351.005" data-end_ts="351.125" title="351.005" id=c_"351.005">__know__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Well, I mean, I definitely do. <span style="color:red" data-ts="354.925" data-end_ts="355.045" title="354.925" id=c_"354.925">__I__</span>, I mean, there's definitely times that start kind of pushing the envelope of some of the sonic sounds and even in a live approach, if you're feeding off of somebody else, depending on who <span style="color:red" data-ts="366.085" data-end_ts="366.205" title="366.085" id=c_"366.085">__that__</span> other person is, you know, we could get into some fairly dark areas for sure. I mean, just, I mean, dark and just that it's edgy sounds and some discordant stuff and Right. You know, all that type of thing. But, when I, when I, when I started using the Native American flute, which, I guess that might've been about 13 years ago. So it's actually fairly recent in my palette of instruments. Although I played woodwinds early in my early in my life, but, and I'm part Native American, so that also <laugh> that also made the Native American flute a natural. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>But when I added that, that that added another quality that's, that's actually not quite so dark, it might make something that's a little, little darker in the padding lifted up a little bit. Right. Just in, in the, in the fact that it's a flute. And it, it also made my music a lot more accessible, to people around the globe. And I kind of found that out because most of that time was spent in the virtual world, launching all that stuff, broadcasting all this music out as far as when I started adding the Native American flute. So I got, I've gotten a lot of feedback from different people around the world. And, you know, I mean, the flute, the flute is, there's just something special about the sound of a flute and everybody's culture. It's such an old instrument. I mean, you know, we know of a 35,000 year old, Griffin Bone flute, that Neanderthal man used. So I mean, it's, you know, it's ingrained, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? There's like a, there's like a cellular resonance with that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>It, yeah, I really think there is. So, so that's, that's attractive to people everywhere. And, and when I travel around and play, you know, it's just, people really respond. They really respond to the flute, and they also respond to the iwi, which is an electronic wind instrument. And basically it's kind of like a, a synthesizer saxophone, clarinet, flute type of a device. But again, it's a woodwind. And, and, you know, I mean, that's, that's part, that's part of it. The, the intensity of, you know, playing a woodwind instrument over electronics is that you get this very expressive, very from the heart. I mean, you're, you know, you're blowing your breath of life through this thing, and it lets you express, it's kind of like the lead singer of my, you know, of my music now. Right. Is the flute or the iwi. I mean, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm a melody guy. I like, you know, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="534.645" data-end_ts="534.845" title="534.645" id=c_"534.645">__like__</span> melodies, and that's lots of times, you know, that's my part. Drones and melodies with, when I, when I play with other people. You know, you were talking about just the, the soul, the soulfulness of it, the, the flute definitely is an extension of your breath and, and very much like singing, I guess, if you know, as far as a, a kind of a lead instrument. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, it's, it's interesting. I <laugh>, for Father's Day, my family bought me a very nice, native American flute, and I have been having a wonderful time with it. But I would say that the two people that have that I look to as inspiration on that, are you, you and Robert Rich now? Robert Rich Plays, P Vvc <span style="color:red" data-ts="582.165" data-end_ts="582.365" title="582.165" id=c_"582.165">__Ice__</span> Trans 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b><laugh>. Yeah. Transverse Flute, but, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. But, but, one of the things that that really excited me was, just before I got the flute, but I knew I was getting it, I got an opportunity to see you do a concert. Now I want to talk more about your history with virtualized concerts, because Uhhuh <affirmative>, you were, you've been a very, very much a groundbreaker in that world, but I saw you do a concert, on a site called, I think Concert Window. Is that correct? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Yeah. Concert Window. Yeah. And, and just real quick, what makes that so attractive is that you, there's a, there's an app for, iPhone called Bus, and you can actually just with one button open up the app and push one button and you can be broadcasting to your page. So it'd be concert window.com/Tony Gerber Right, right. Any, anytime I open up that phone and broadcast, it's pushing to that page. So it, it's the quickest, easiest way to do a video broadcast stream for somebody that I've ever encountered. Now, the, the disadvantage is it's, I have to have my speakers on. I, I can't do it direct line in, I have to have my speakers on in my studio for the microphone to pick it up. Right. But that works okay. But it's just, I don't, I don't necessarily usually play that way in my studio. Sure. Usually under headphones. But I'm glad to know that you, you saw that and that, you know, that it, it was turned out good. 'cause I've only done maybe four or five like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, it was really interesting, first of all, because, I got to see some of the gear that you use, someday you and I are gonna have a long discussion about the Sledge, because that looks interesting to me, but I'm not sure <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Yeah. Well, I mean, you know, I mean, it, it's, it's a Waldorf based instrument. So if you're familiar with Waldorf or Felds or any of that kind of stuff, basically it's that type of an engine just with all the knobs, more like a mini <span style="color:red" data-ts="703.525" data-end_ts="703.805" title="703.525" id=c_"703.525">__mode__</span> to control. Gotcha. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I like all the knobs, but, but the other thing is I got to see you play some of the woodwind based stuff, and, far more than when I, far more than when I, listened to your recorded work, seeing you perform somehow, seeing you play the Melody, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Uhhuh <affirmative> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Kind of, for me, brought it forward. So when you talk about being a Melody guy, I would, I would say when I, when I saw that performance that really, that really struck me as you, you being out front and again, this idea of the flute and the iwi being, being the lead singers, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="748.065" data-end_ts="748.285" title="748.065" id=c_"748.065">__Rob__</span>, the Robert plants of your, of your Led Zeppelin <laugh>, is, is, is very, was very, was very visceral in that, in that moment. So, in addition though, the, the performance thing, the virtual performance thing that you are, I would dare say famous for, is the work that you've done in Second Life. Now, you are probably one of the first people I even heard of attempting this, but you built up up a pretty significant following. And you, you have been doing a long form or a, you have been doing a, a performance practice there for a very long time, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Since, yeah, 2006, actually, February of 2000. February of 2006 is when I went in there. And then in May of 2006, I did my first, concert. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. So it's been like right on nine years already. Yeah. How many, how many performances have you done in that time? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Right at about 1600 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. That's outrageous. So, but when you started it, had you heard of other people trying to do this at the time? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Actually, no. I went in, <span style="color:red" data-ts="830.565" data-end_ts="830.685" title="830.565" id=c_"830.565">__I__</span>, I mean, what, what was interesting about the virtual world was I, I had just had a, my first and only child, I got married late in life. And, you know, you kind of detach yourself a little bit from, well, not a little bit. I mean, I, you know, I mean, I've moved, moved out from in downtown of Nashville, you know, outta a suburb and, you know, got a house and, and set my studio up and, and, you know, just, you're just not as, in the loop on stuff when you've got a family and starting a family. So anyway, as soon as a ALA was born, I discovered the virtual world. I mean, like, it, it was maybe a couple months after she was born, and I, I was big into three dimensional, rendering, worked on a VAX seven 80 back in the mid eighties, and, doing <span style="color:red" data-ts="880.785" data-end_ts="881.005" title="880.785" id=c_"880.785">__an__</span>, even doing animation and stuff pretty early in, <span style="color:red" data-ts="883.985" data-end_ts="884.205" title="883.985" id=c_"883.985">__in__</span> everything. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>And so I imagined all kinds of three D type of worlds. But then, then I was off into other stuff and kind of had forgotten about that. So when I actually went into Second Life for the first time, it just blew me away. I had no idea that, that there was something that organized in that far advanced for, you know, and it really hasn't changed much since then, to be honest with you, Uhhuh <affirmative>, you know? But anyway, it's still, you know, it's still going. I <span style="color:red" data-ts="912.425" data-end_ts="912.585" title="912.425" id=c_"912.425">__still__</span>, I'm still doing shows in there, but not near as much. But anyway, when I went in there, you know, I realized that this would be a platform to do some live music. And one of the reasons is because I was, I'd gotten into internet broadcast pretty early here in Nashville, like in, in 1995, right at the beginning of the internet, kind of, thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>I set up, an internet radio station on Music Row. But it was, you know, it was so far ahead of anything. None of the labels were interested. No. I mean, I had people come and they didn't know, you know, they didn't know what to think. Right. I was, I was broadcast, but I mean, it was more country related, but the technology and the concept was there early. And, and somebody came to me like 14 years after that and said, music row, the record labels are finally, you know, they're all excited about having their own internet radio station, <laugh>. You know what I mean? It was just, so anyway, I had an interest in <span style="color:red" data-ts="976.985" data-end_ts="977.105" title="976.985" id=c_"976.985">__the__</span> internet radio and realized that connection kind of with the virtual world. 'cause that's basically what you're doing. You're doing a, a live radio broadcast. And in the virtual world, the, the venues or the land that the people come to, you plug the broadcast link into the land, so their computer then picks up whatever I'm talking about or whatever I'm playing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Okay. So, so it's just a, you know, it's, it's another, it's another place to have your broadcast. People can tune in and just listen to the audio, or they can go in to, to the virtual world. And one of the things that I did early, very well, I mean, right at the beginning was I associated myself with a group, a large group that was already established in Second Life. And when I was younger, I mean, I was into reading, reading High Fantasy and science fiction and, you know, dragons and, and Hobbit and all that kind of stuff. So I, I, I, I, I discovered that there was a lot of elfs and fairies and dragons and, and gnomes and all the, you know, the high fantasy group. And I went in there and it was actually the largest, most organized group in there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>So I, I basically went in as an elf then, and I started hanging out with that community. Okay. Which a lot of, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1056.225" data-end_ts="1056.345" title="1056.225" id=c_"1056.225">__a__</span> lot of 'em were my age and actually older, even 10 and 15 years older, you know, older hippies and just, I mean, it was just a group of people that were really into live music, and they were just good people. So anyway, I got real involved there. But what it, what it meant was the first time I decided to do a concert, I pretty much, you know, filled up the thing because All <span style="color:red" data-ts="1076.885" data-end_ts="1077.045" title="1076.885" id=c_"1076.885">__right__</span>. You had a built-in audience. Right. All my people there came, you know, so, so anyway, I started out that way. And, and, I think there was less than 10 of us when we, you know, when I started performing. 'cause I mean, I wasn't the first, but I discovered the other guys that had come in and, well, and not, I mean, there was a couple women too, so, but I was, you know, in the first 10 to, to perform in Second Life. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Wow. And I went in really in a professional way. I mean, I, you know, I mean, I went in with all seriousness, you know? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and, and created posters for every show. And, you know, I set up stores all over the virtual world in different places. I sold my, and still do, I mean, there's vending machines that have my flutes that I modeled and three d and then they have my sample loops of my flute playing. So people that don't play music, they can buy one of my flutes and they can pull it out and, you know, it plays the sample and everybody else in the room can hear it in the virtual world. And, you know, I sell those for 1500 Lindens, which is like $6 and US dollars. Right. Whenever, when they buy that, it goes into my PayPal account. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>So, you know, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1147.085" data-end_ts="1147.365" title="1147.085" id=c_"1147.085">__kind__</span>, kind of discovered a, a different way of making some money since really in 2006, the CD sales, pretty much. Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1155.315" data-end_ts="1155.605" title="1155.315" id=c_"1155.315">__It's__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1155.605" data-end_ts="1155.645" title="1155.605" id=c_"1155.605">__much__</span>. Yeah. So, you know, this was a, this was a, a different way of, of making some, making some money. I mean, to basically pay for my time and my effort into it because, you know, having a family and trying to do all that, I mean, it wasn't like I could just be in there and, you know, just tooling around and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1176.045" data-end_ts="1176.285" title="1176.045" id=c_"1176.045">__spend__</span> it. 'cause early on, I spent a lot of time to set up basically the kind of music empire that I set up in there, and start collaborating with other artists and doing some, you know, really, there's a, there's some YouTube stuff up there. Like if Cypress Rosewood is what my name is in, they're like two trees, C-Y-P-R-E-S-S rosewood. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>And if you type that in YouTube, it'll bring up a bunch of different stuff. But, there's, there's some of the things that we did, it's, it's kind of like a type of performance art that really could not take place any other place. And, it was very, very exciting and working with programmers and artists and, you know, animators. And, so it was really, you know, I had a really, really great time with all that. And, and it kind of changed for me in 2010, because we had a major flood here, and Right. We had about five foot of water <span style="color:red" data-ts="1235.325" data-end_ts="1235.525" title="1235.325" id=c_"1235.325">__at__</span> our house. So that kind of dera that derailed the, because I was at a fervor right before that of doing stuff in there. And, and, you know, it kind of, it changed a little bit. And I actually started doing a lot more real life concerts again. So, so it, it, it started edging off. But I mean, I still do, you know, one or two concerts a week and have kept up one Sunday night show since 2008. So for seven years I've been doing every Sunday night, unless I'm out of town or doing another live show. You, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Actually, the, the one time that I, that I saw one of your, I, I was never a second Life person, uhhuh, but at one point I was, visiting my friend Mike Matley, and he was like, he was like, oh, Tony's doing a show. Have you ever seen one of these? I'm like, no. And so he tuned in and kinda like, stood in the background and watched it, and it was, it was wild. But it was also, you know, if, if you're not into it, it's, it's almost a little disturbing because you see these things and, and they look like I iconography of different types. And some people put an amazing amount of effort into it. Right. But, when, but all of a sudden you realize these are, each one of those things represents an actual person. It's really pretty amazing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Well, it is. And, and I just remember how I was for the first two or three months in there, and I mean, it blew my mind. I mean, it still kind of blows my mind some, but I mean it, boy, for the first few months, you know, it was, it was very intense. And, you had to <span style="color:red" data-ts="1330.885" data-end_ts="1331.085" title="1330.885" id=c_"1330.885">__act__</span>, you kind of had to acclimate to it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, sure. And, especially I think, you talked about sort of like taking <span style="color:red" data-ts="1337.665" data-end_ts="1337.885" title="1337.665" id=c_"1337.665">__out__</span> a persona of an elf. I mean, there's a lot of us that grew up in sort of the scientific science fiction fantasy world. Right? Right. But the only, the only opportunity to really sort of like, live that life was, you know, occasionally when, you know, some hotel would get taken over by, you know, by a group or something for a weekend. But it was never, this, this was the first time you could actually sort of like, live an entire life and not ever have to break out of character within that world. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>And, and it's kind of like a book I, I've equated it to people. Like, when you read a really good book, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1375.865" data-end_ts="1376.085" title="1375.865" id=c_"1375.865">__the__</span> place that your mind goes, I mean, it's not exactly the same, but <span style="color:red" data-ts="1381.325" data-end_ts="1381.485" title="1381.325" id=c_"1381.325">__there__</span>, there's a similarity there. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>But, but the thing about the virtual world that's really interesting is it forces you to be in the moment. And you can't really, I mean, it really does force you to be in the moment. And, and it tears down any stereotypes of anything because you don't really know, you know, you don't know that the person you're talking to might be in a wheelchair. You know, you don't know what their skin color is, what their religion is. And, and it doesn't really matter. Right. You know, and, and it's, and that's kind of enlightening in some ways. You know, I don't, it's, it's that, that's really interesting. But being, doing these shows in Second Life, kind of, especially the Sunday night show, one thing it's kind of worked into, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1423.165" data-end_ts="1423.285" title="1423.165" id=c_"1423.165">__'cause__</span> you, I know you're wanting to talk about the live aspect and 'cause that is what I really thrive on, is playing this stuff live. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>And, the Sunday Night Show I've started doing, well, I mean, I started doing it years ago, but these duo concerts. And so I invite friends of mine to come over to my studio to do the Sunday Night show live. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> lot, lots of times. In fact, the one this past Sunday, two nights ago was, Steven <span style="color:red" data-ts="1452.115" data-end_ts="1452.605" title="1452.115" id=c_"1452.115">__Seaford__</span>, and he's a dulcimer player. He's a mountain dulcimer player. And, I mean, he also dabbles in some other stuff. Now he is got a keyboard and some other stuff, but he is very well known as, as a mountain dulcimer player. Okay. So, and we've done some stuff before. We actually did a three-way triple, trio daisy chain type of concert, very early on, like eight years ago, probably in 2007, with, my friend Jan Pulsford, who was with, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1483.525" data-end_ts="1483.805" title="1483.525" id=c_"1483.525">__Cindy__</span> Lauper and, for a few years, co-produced and wrote a bunch of stuff with her. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>And she was with, the Thompson twins back in the eighties. Yeah, right. She's from England. So, anyway, I've dragged her into the virtual world, and we ended up doing a, a triple thing, which was really interesting. But my whole point was I'm bringing people that I, you know, that, that don't necessarily play this kind of music. And because it's, because most of it's in the moment. You know, it's, it's, I, we, we don't discuss a whole lot of stuff before the shows. I mean, we might, you know, we might trade a couple sounds and, you know, I've got some favorite keys I like to play in and, and my favorite flutes are in, and I'll throw those ideas out. But generally, you know, it's this kind of a blend where the, the visiting artist is, you know, I'm dragging, I'm pulling them over to the space side, you know, and, and trying to, trying to have 'em slow down, you know, listen twice, play once <laugh> kind of, you know, just, it, it's a different experience for them. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>So they always leave here, you know, and, you know, they're like, man, you really took me on a, an adventure, you know, a musical adventure. So I love it because if, you know, whenever I play with somebody else, it just makes, you know, you've got a formula there, you got an A plus AB, and it's gonna equal something else, then just self. Or, you know, if the B is a different, you know, a different person, every different person mixes to have a different, formula or, you know, a different outcome. And, I really, really enjoy that a lot. So there's been all kinds of different people. I mean, you know, people here in Nashville, people that are into doing the space music or people that are not, you know. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's funny because, it seems like Nashville's the perfect spot for it, because you do have, and and I've heard this before from other people, that Nashville people think of it as solely a country mecca. But that actually, it is sort of for the center part of the US it's like the center of all kinds of music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Yeah, it's music city, right. It's not, it's not country music city. It's music city. And, and I mean, you, there are the, I mean, I've heard the best people from India, Africa, south America, I mean, you know, jazz. I mean, we got craft work coming in September to the Ryman Auditorium. <laugh>. Now, I, I would've never, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1637.665" data-end_ts="1637.885" title="1637.665" id=c_"1637.665">__got__</span> million 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Years, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Those two things ever would go together, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>But, you know, it's a lot more, I think people realize a lot more that it's all styles of music. And, and I'm actually working on a, a, like a TV show. It'll be like a YouTube show or, or, you know, that'll be the delivery system through the internet, but it'll be a regular, you know, kind of, in a venue production. But, its main purpose is to show all different styles. So one, one week we might have bluegrass. One week we might have electronic, one week we might have, you know, two <span style="color:red" data-ts="1672.665" data-end_ts="1672.885" title="1672.665" id=c_"1672.665">__and__</span> throat singers. And next week it might be some drummers from Burundi. I mean, you know, I just, I wanna have something coming outta Nashville that the world can tune into. And they can see all this amazing music from around the world of all the people that come to Nashville and play. 'cause it seems like everybody ends up through here at one time or another. So Right. If I'm able to tap into some of that and get, get some of 'em to play live and, and, you know, so that, that's one thing I'm working on. I'm <span style="color:red" data-ts="1700.485" data-end_ts="1700.645" title="1700.485" id=c_"1700.485">__ho__</span> I thought it was gonna get launched earlier than it is, but, but we're still moving forward on it, but Okay. It's actually called the Music Tellers, so I'll be able to check that out. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>One question I have, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1713.035" data-end_ts="1713.325" title="1713.035" id=c_"1713.035">__when__</span> this, this is kind of particular to when you're in a music center. So I, I do a bunch of work out of la but Nashville and New York, and sometimes Chicago will all have <span style="color:red" data-ts="1726.445" data-end_ts="1726.645" title="1726.445" id=c_"1726.445">__this__</span> same kind of thing. Sometimes when you <span style="color:red" data-ts="1729.325" data-end_ts="1729.485" title="1729.325" id=c_"1729.325">__are__</span> in a place with the best possible musicians, what you get is a very, very high level of musicianship. But it's, it's almost too showy. Now, you talk about when you do these duets that you kind of are trying to drag people maybe kicking and screaming, into a more slowed down mode. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>How, how difficult do you find that, and, and are there kind of things that you do in your playing that kind of draws them in that direction? Because you talk about not really talking over a lot of stuff. So how is it that you draw people into slowing down <span style="color:red" data-ts="1769.915" data-end_ts="1770.075" title="1769.915" id=c_"1769.915">__to__</span> being more in contemplative? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Well, I would <span style="color:red" data-ts="1773.915" data-end_ts="1774.115" title="1773.915" id=c_"1773.915">__like__</span>, I, I mean, my perception when you say, or showing us, or, or, or, you know, my perception on that is that generally the musicians in Nashville, they are some of the best in the world for sure. And, but the showy part is not so much there in the musicians that are here lots of times. 'cause they're more studio musicians are more behind the scenes, in LA and New York. I mean, I can see how some of the, there's a lot more flash and a lot more stuff that might go with it. The flash here is just purely in the raw talent of the playing usually. You know, it's like they don't have to try to be flashy <laugh>. Right. What they're playing is, you know, so, you know, that's been a real, definitely a real pleasure to be able to be around that stuff. 'cause it uplifts, you know, your own stuff. Sure. I mean, I mean, it uplifts it by them playing with it, but it also uplifts you to play better than you might before when you're in the context of some of these, you know, different, different people. So I think the tones of sounds that I have and, and the drones a lot. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I mean, you know, it, it doesn't take but, 60 seconds probably to put a calm on this situation, <laugh> <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>You know, I mean, it's, yeah. I don't, I don't know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Lay, lay a nice drone blanket down and everyone understands it, huh. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Right. And I'm usually start, I'm usually, you know, I'm usually starting out. Right. You know, so they're kind of, you know, kind of do, like I do sometimes when I go play with somebody else, I'm kinda like playing off of what they're, they're, they're kind <span style="color:red" data-ts="1871.365" data-end_ts="1871.485" title="1871.365" id=c_"1871.365">__of__</span> leading the way and I'm, you know, doing my melodies and stuff to weave in and out, but they're kind of the timeline. So that's kinda the way it is. When I come over here. I'm kind of the timeline and they're, you know, adding embellishments and weaving in and out with, with their, their deal. So. Sure. Got 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It. There's two things about these live performances that I really want to dive into. One of 'em we started talking about, so I'll kind of continue in that vein. If you've done six, 1600 performances, where do you get the motivation for the next one? Now I can see where the doing the duets is gonna open a door to something new and, you know, exciting. But you still do a lot of this stuff solo, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Yeah. But, you know, don't forget, it's, it's of the moment music. So, so the reason, the reason that I can keep doing it is because it's not the ever the same. I mean, I, you know, I have my stylistic things and little motifs here and there and certain sounds and, you know, but it, but it morphs. Like if I, if I go back and listen to, to my, the music that I was doing nine years ago, right. If, if I would follow through, and I really haven't even done this. I mean, I have a little bit, but not, not like purposely gone and done it, but if I would take some samplings from each year and, and there would be a definite, definite morphing of where the musics went. Sure. And it, and it's not me sitting and writing specific songs and then playing 'em, you know, it's, it's me in the moment creating whatever mood I'm in context, you know, whatever. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>I mean, it's just so, it, it's, it's always different. I mean, there are similarities. I mean, there's gonna be similarities doing that, you know, that much stuff. But I'm trying to think of what it's more like, it's more, it's, it's almost like for me, it's almost like a meditation for an hour. Right. I'm almost tunnel vision or really almost unaware of my surroundings. I'm so hyper-focused into to what I'm playing. And, it's, it's, like I said, it's not there. There'll be some similarities, but I don't get tired of it because it's not the same thing. Right. If I, if I was doing a rock, you know, rock or folk or something like that where I was singing the same songs over and over, you know, that, that would get pretty laborious to me. And that's why I'm really into in the moment music and doing it live that way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. It's interesting you say that. I mean, I have, actually, for my playing, I have a problem because I have real issues with memorization. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Well, yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2028.915" data-end_ts="2029.405" title="2028.915" id=c_"2028.915">__Anymore__</span>. So this solves that. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2031.165" data-end_ts="2031.365" title="2031.165" id=c_"2031.165">__It__</span> sure, sure does. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2032.395" data-end_ts="2032.685" title="2032.395" id=c_"2032.395">__Even__</span> make it an issue. And I mean, and all that is all that is part of it. You know, it's like I don't have time to rehearse lots of times with different, even my band spacecraft, which, you know, that, probably that's probably the most well-known project I've done. You know, we could, we could never rehearse. Half the band was in Lexington and half the band was in Nashville. Right. And basically, the longer we were apart, when we would come together and do a show, the more interesting it would be. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Well, and it's something, because you talk about your solo things being kind of a meditation, but working with the band can be kind of a meditation too. But one of the things taking that approach is gonna do is it's going to mean not only is it of the moment in terms of what notes you're playing and instrumentation you're using, but it's also gonna be in the moment in terms of where you are currently, emotionally, physically, you know, psychically, all that stuff is gonna have its impact. So when you talk about kind of like following the train of time, you would pro, what you would probably be seeing is actually the change in your sort of like, emotional stability. The change physically as you, as you age or whatever, all these things are gonna be heard in music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Yeah, yeah. You're right. I mean, it, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2105.665" data-end_ts="2105.885" title="2105.665" id=c_"2105.665">__and__</span>, and the thing is, you know, I've recorded the first couple years of plan, I didn't record much. But I recorded some. But ever since then, you know, I've recorded almost every show. I mean, I've got hundreds of hours of recordings of all this stuff. And the last two years it's all multitrack. So I've got all these hours and hours of concerts that are all multitrack. So, and I've never even went, you know, I think I've released, maybe, well, I've released, I mean, since I started doing the Second Life thing, I've probably released maybe five albums, four or five albums that stem from that music. Right. You know, that was created in there. But I've got, so that's part of what I'm trying to do is figure out, you know, how can I, you know, how can I use all this stuff working? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>And, I do have a, a Sony PlayStation four game with some guys in Europe and Tokyo that I'm working on that, were were very big fans of my music, and they used my music as they did programming and as they did graphic arts for this game. Okay. And then they couldn't think of anything else but my music for the game. Of course. So they, so they contacted me and under that premise, and that was really, I loved the way that happened. Sure. So, I, I mean, I was able to just send them maybe, you know, 10, 12 hours worth of music. And, and they were able to find stuff that, that worked. So, you know, that's, you know, that's, I would like to find more stuff like that, obviously. 'cause the stuff's already been done. Right. And, even, even the, even the soundtrack that I did at, for, vanilla Sky, the Tom Cruise movie, the Paramount Pictures that was, that was also, you know, from an album that we had already recorded. Right. So, you know, I, I am really, really into recording that moment of creation. So that's why, you know, like I, I look at music, the art of music and the craft of music, and the art of music is more what I do. The craft of music is more when you, you know, you, you practice the songs over and over and over again, and basically you're crafting a song. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>What I'm doing is I'm creating in the moment. So that's more like, you know, when you're doing a painting or Right. You know, or something like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That's, that's an interesting view of it because Right. It seems, it seems like songwriting is like being a sculptor, but, but what you're doing is more like being a graffiti artist. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b><laugh> Yeah. Po yeah. Possibly. For sure. There is the sculptor kind of thing with the layering of the sounds. Right. And, you know, some of the sonic kind of, I mean, you know, we're doing stuff with surround sound and seven one, there's definitely a lot more, it is a really good, analogy for that. But what you just said for what I would've described in the, in the moment is a lot like, <laugh> graffiti, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Like speed painting of some sort, you know? So the other thing that I wanted to talk about, and, and you, you've opened a door a little bit just in these last statements, a second. Life used to be on everyone's mind. Now it's not so much, I mean, there are still active communities there. Oh yeah. But things have things, you know, the, in terms of being like the center of people's vision of the internet, it's, it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2325.885" data-end_ts="2326.045" title="2325.885" id=c_"2325.885">__<crosstalk>__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Yeah. Here's what's kind of happened there. I mean, there's still, like, when I go and log in, there's usually, there's almost always over 50,000 people that are logged in. Okay. <laugh>. So, I mean, you know, that's a, that's a, that's a pretty good, you know, that's a pretty good chunk. I mean, it's not like Facebook or something like that. Right. But if Facebook or something like that does bring this platform and this concept in with the goggles and stuff, you know, I'm just, wait, I'm waiting for that next level of this to happen. 'cause you know, the, the track record that I have, I mean, I should be able to go in and go gangbusters on whatever the next thing is. You know, basically building on kind of what I've already done. I mean, I'd probably be starting from scratch again, but, the, the experience and the concept of everything's there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>So, but, but what's happened is it's the, the media's quit talking about it. And there's some things that changed, but the people that are in there are spending longer time in there, Uhhuh <affirmative>. So it's, it's kind of sh it's kind of shifted because there's, you know, the pla it's, it's really a plat. It's, it's not a game, it's a platform. So you got people in there doing education, you got people in there doing, you know, all, all kinds of stuff that are, that's not like World of Warcraft type type of stuff. Right, right. A lot of that stuff's still going on. Now, some of the businesses pulled out, you know, there were some businesses and they just couldn't, they couldn't make it work, or they weren't willing. What happened is, is the 2008 crash, a lot of the corporations pulled out and saw it as an extra expense instead of hanging in there and, and riding with it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Because I actually put Gibson guitar in there back in 2008, before, you know, like a year before the, the, the economy tanked. We built this incredible island for Gibson. It was a one year project. And I was in the virtual world every day doing that and had a blast. And we had all, we had celebrities coming in and all kinds of stuff lined up. And then the economy tanked. And Henry, the guy, the president, CEO of, of Gibson just, you know, freaked out and pulled the plug. Right. That was after he sunk a lot of money and a lot of time, you know, I mean, we had gotten a lot of stuff going. So that was really for like $295 a month or whatever his net was to keep the thing going. I thought that was pretty shortsighted. Right. 'cause he put, he put a lot of money into it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>But, you know, it, some of that stuff changed the media when the big business, you know, didn't have as much involved. And some of the stuff, it, it, it changed the attention some, but Got it. But it's still, you know, it's, it's, it's still pretty cool. And, and there's also open sim and some others, you know, open architecture kind of stuff that a lot of people are, are migrating to. And so, but the next big thing, it really hasn't changed much though in nine years. So the next level of something is gonna have to probably be the goggles and, you know, a a a different, a different platform, but, but similar. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So how do you imagine swiveling to something like that? Because, you know, you admitted that when you got started in Second Life, you put a lot of effort into building the persona and the environment and sort of your, your place in that space. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>How do you, when you put that much effort into a platform, how harsh is it to think about the next platform? I mean, is it something you don't want to think about until it's obvious? Or is it something that you're kind of actively looking forward to and looking for? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>I'm, I'm <span style="color:red" data-ts="2547.005" data-end_ts="2547.125" title="2547.005" id=c_"2547.005">__Act__</span> Yeah. I'm actively looking. I mean, you know, 'cause I'm usually have been kind of on the front edge of the wave type of stuff. Right. My old career. So, you know, I'm, I'm, when when I, when I came across Second Life, my skin was buzzing <laugh>. That's how, that's how excited I was. And I've had other things in my life that I, that I followed have that same response. So when that happens to me, I know that I'm definitely doing the right thing. Right. Right. So, you know, 'cause <span style="color:red" data-ts="2576.725" data-end_ts="2576.845" title="2576.725" id=c_"2576.725">__I__</span>, 'cause I'm an intuition kind of person, it's just, you know, I mean, the music's intuitive and I just try to, I try to as best as I can, stay in the moment and enjoy each day and follow my intuition. Sure. So the music's a lot that way. And hopefully something will present itself, you know, in the next level. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>And No, I mean, I'm not, like, I can totally imagine retooling up and doing whatever the next level thing is because I mean, you know, I, I got a lot outta second wife. I don't go in there at all anymore. I just bop in to do my show and I'm out. Right. I don't spend any time in there at all anymore. But I mean, I'm not making near as much money either. Right. You know, I mean, there was a time when, you know, it was a pretty good amount of, I mean, it was, you know, a sizable amount of money when I was doing the shows. You know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2626.635" data-end_ts="2626.855" title="2626.635" id=c_"2626.635">__it__</span> was, you know, sometimes two, three shows a day. Yeah. I mean, you know, that's, that's a lot of work and, and people appreciate it. Oh, sure. But, you know, 'cause radio's different people don't tip with radio. 
</p>

<b>Tony: </b>You can do a radio show on a major network, you know, and, and mention you got a website there with a tip jar and whatever, and, and nobody comes out. You might get one or two people, you know? Right. But in Second Life, it was set up as a precedent to tip the live music. And that was just from the very beginning. That was part of it. And people, you know, people just, they appreciate live music. I mean, they're hungry for live music. So, and my style of music is different than, you know, if you have a rock band or something, you try to go into Second <span style="color:red" data-ts="2670.415" data-end_ts="2670.695" title="2670.415" id=c_"2670.415">__Life__</span>, you know, it's just not, I mean, you hear one and that's about it. Yeah. But because mine's different every time and because it's, it's more contemplative and it's good music while you're working on the computer, it helps you focus. There's lots of things about the style of music that was perfect for the virtual world. So the model and the type of thing that I had just wouldn't fit everybody's music. 'cause it had a lot to do with what the music is and the, the style for that, for that type of environment. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Do you think that that, that there's any opportunity for music the way that you do it in the current kind of streaming world? 'cause right now it strikes me that a lot of what's being done in streaming is sort of the antithesis of what was happening with Second Life. It's sort of like, it's sort of like trying to emulate either the radio model or the endless record collection model. But there doesn't seem to be a lot of opportunity for live playing unless I've kind of missed something. And if I had, I'd love to know. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Well, I can say on the live thing, living, living in Nashville, you know, this, this is not a very good, this is not a very good time to do live music. I'm not, not saying that there's, I mean, live music is going on all the time in this town, but that's part of the problem. You know, the town's pretty jaded. Right. I don't even do all that. I mean, I do stuff here, but, you know, it's just, you never really make any money here. Nobody ever gets paid here. I mean, it's, you know, it's hard to believe. I mean, you can go 30 minutes away from Nashville and, and get paid at a venue, you know, and that's a lot more similar in the rest part of the country. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But what I've started doing recently, like last year, is I'm starting to go to the places in the world that I sold the most music and the people that I know are really into this kind of music and that, and that tends to be the north, the far north, like Quebec and Iceland and Finland and you know, Russia and, Malaysia actually. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>And I mean, there's all these places that I know, I have fans, I've talked to 'em, I know from the numbers when I was selling CDs with distributors that they, you know, they bought stuff over there and Right. Like in Russia, they bootleg all my stuff, you know, and I, I get all kinds of stuff and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2815.205" data-end_ts="2815.325" title="2815.205" id=c_"2815.205">__the__</span>, you know, there was no way for me to meet the economy. You know, there's no way for me to have anything to sell to them. You know, if you're only making 20 bucks a month, you know, how are you gonna play $10 for a CD or $15? You know? It was ridiculous to try to figure out how you even do it. So I, you know, I had some people ask me if they <span style="color:red" data-ts="2833.165" data-end_ts="2833.405" title="2833.165" id=c_"2833.165">__mine__</span> it, if they duplicated my music and sold it on the streets bootleg. And I said, I don't care if, you know, if if, if there's people that really want to hear it that bad, I just look at it as pr. Right. And I don't worry about the money aspect. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Just make sure your name's on it. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Yeah. Well, I mean, some people get bent outta shape and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2852.685" data-end_ts="2852.805" title="2852.685" id=c_"2852.685">__I__</span>, I mean, if, you know, there's blatant stuff that I would probably get bent outta shape over, but I, you know, that I just, you know, I don't see how you can, it'd be hard to work within their economy to figure out how to even get the music delivered to 'em. Sure. So, and I know it helps people. I get emails sometimes from people that they tell me how they use the music and, you know, those are the really, I mean, that's some of the best stuff, you know, when, when somebody, when it touches somebody's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2879.445" data-end_ts="2879.565" title="2879.445" id=c_"2879.445">__life__</span> in a positive way and they have some story about, you know, how the music works for them. Right. 'cause it's different for everybody. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's, that's a pretty amazing thing. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2889.165" data-end_ts="2889.285" title="2889.165" id=c_"2889.165">__I__</span>, and I think the opportunity to kind of travel based off of the people that you've met and the people that you've touched is pretty, is pretty amazing Now, given your history, in sort of developing your own performance practice and one that, you know, it's kind of peculiar, but it kind, but pretty interesting and amazing. What advice would you give to somebody who right now might be in their bedroom playing with their pile of gear to basically take the next step and to be a little more in the moment and be a little bit more present for the outside world? How, how do you get people, how can you, how do you think you could help people get out of the bedroom? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>I mean, you know, the internet broadcast is definitely, I mean, I, you know, that's, that would be the best way I could, that I could say. I mean, one of, one of my friends who lives in Denmark, I met in Second Life and, his name's Torbin Asp and he was a bedroom artist for years. He never, ever played a live concert out of the bedroom. Well then he, but, but he was broadcasting, you know, that was, that was his first blast out onto the global global stage was, broadcasting through Second Life. But, you know, it doesn't have to be second life. It can be all kinds of stuff. There's different radio stations that pick up live broadcasts. So, you know, you can, you can pick up a, a little mini Mac for a hundred dollars an old one. 'cause it doesn't have to be anything fancy to broadcast. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Like, I've, I've got one and it sits there 24 7 broadcasting my playlist <span style="color:red" data-ts="2988.625" data-end_ts="2988.845" title="2988.625" id=c_"2988.625">__and__</span> my music and stuff that was on my label I had a few years ago. And then when I play live, I just switch it over into live mode broadcast. I mean, that is definitely the best way to get outside of the bedroom. And, and Tobin, he, he met somebody in second wife in Ohio and became kind of romantically involved or whatever. And he ended up coming over to the United States and came to Ohio. And I talked to him in <span style="color:red" data-ts="3011.525" data-end_ts="3011.605" title="3011.525" id=c_"3011.525">__a__</span> driving down in Nashville, which it's probably, you know, six hours drive or something. And he played his first live concert with me in real life here in Nashville. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's an amazing story. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Yeah. And, and it was, you know, 'cause I, I mean, I just kept telling him his music was so awesome. And I was like, man, you just have to do this live. You just have to do this live. And after, you know, a few years he finally did. And it was with me over a year. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="3037.285" data-end_ts="3037.485" title="3037.285" id=c_"3037.285">__Aw__</span>, that's amazing. That's great. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>But yeah, I would definitely, you know, the internet <span style="color:red" data-ts="3041.975" data-end_ts="3042.325" title="3041.975" id=c_"3041.975">__would__</span>, is, is definitely the way to, you know, to where you can stay in your bedroom and you can still have an audience that's out there and you can feel the live energy. You know, I mean, as an artist, you can feel the live people out there on the stream listening. And if you're listening, you can tell that it's live. You know, there's some kind of energy that's, that's there just like a real concert. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's being transmitted somehow, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>But it is transmitted somehow. 'cause you can tell if somebody's spinning Right. You know, and not playing. Right. And I don't know how I, you know, but you can most of the time <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, Tony, I want to thank you for the fabulous and wide ranging discussion. It was great to hear, both about your background, but really about kind of your vision for your future as well. It's really exciting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Yeah, thanks for asking for sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. And, where is it that, people should go to most easily hear some of your, some of your work? 'cause I wanna make sure that I love it, I wanna make sure that I introduce other people to it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Yeah, probably the best portal is Tony Gerbercom and that's be the easiest one to remember. But if you just tack my name on the end of a lot of the sites, you'll find stuff too. Like reverb nation.com/Tony Gerber youtube.com/Tony Gerber soundcloud.com/Tony Gerber bandcamp dot Tony Gerbercom. All right. Between all of that, there's a ton of music out there. Alright, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Fantastic. Well Tony, thank you so much for your time. I appreciate it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Alright, Darwin thank 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You. Have, have a great one. Bye 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tony: </b>Too, buddy. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Many thanks to Tony Gerber for taking the time to talk with me for the podcast. It was really interesting to hear his perspectives, particularly on the different varieties of playing live. It's, he's an incredible performer. If you have a chance to check out any of his online performances, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3166.025" data-end_ts="3166.245" title="3166.025" id=c_"3166.025">__you__</span> deserve to, give that as a gift to yourself. I want to thank everybody again for listening. It's always great to have the fantastic numbers I've been having for the podcast, especially during the doldrums of summer. So I appreciate you continue to listen. Those of you who live in the Midwest, just a quick note. It looks like I, I don't have a particular place yet to announce for Lincoln, but it looks like Lincoln's coming together. Des Moines is for sure coming together. We're trying to get something to happen at Lawrence Kansas. Drop me a line DD <span style="color:red" data-ts="3201.245" data-end_ts="3202.925" title="3201.245" id=c_"3201.245">__g@cyclingseventyfour.com__</span> if you want to keep in touch on whenever we're gonna perform wherever it's gonna be. And also if you just have any questions, comments, ideas for people in podcasts, whatever, I always love hearing from you. So thanks a lot for listening and I will catch you next time around. Bye.
