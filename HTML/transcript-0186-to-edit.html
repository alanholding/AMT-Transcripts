<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today I have a chance to talk to somebody. I've bumped into 'em at trade shows a couple of times. But he's somebody that most everyone in the modular world's going to going to know his name's Scott Yeager. He is, the big brain behind, industrial musical electronics. For those of us who've been around the modular world a while, we would probably recognize it more as the Harvest <span style="color:red" data-ts="40.665" data-end_ts="40.885" title="40.665" id=c_"40.665">__men__</span>, but he does very unique modules, ones that kind of have a very unique visual space too. And so you can kind of, the kind of modules you can identify from across the room. <span style="color:red" data-ts="50.365" data-end_ts="50.645" title="50.365" id=c_"50.365">__Were__</span> very sharp looking and kind of has this iconic knobs and stuff that make it really, really stand out. But, a really interesting set of modules. And I was really excited to have him join us for the podcast. So with that, I'm gonna say hello to Scott. Hey, Scott. How's it going? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott Jaeger: </b>Hello. It's going good today. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thank you so much for taking the time to, to have a chat. I really appreciate it. My understanding is you just got back from a, from a trip to Portland looking after some manufacturing, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>Yes. My modules are manufactured in Portland exclusively by Dark Place Manufacturing. So the nice thing about that arrangement is I am just north of Seattle, so if I'm taking a lot of expensive or heavy parts, it's usually a lot cheaper for me to just take a drive down there and see my friends and drop the <span style="color:red" data-ts="103.165" data-end_ts="103.365" title="103.165" id=c_"103.165">__PO__</span> parts off rather than send a UPS shipment down there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, sure. That makes a lot of sense. Right. Well, and, and you also get a chance to hang out in Portland, which is such a beautiful place. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>Oh, yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What is it that you've got going to manufacturing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>Well, it's a new module that should be out probably second week of August. Realistically, it's called the Argos Bleak, and it is a, control voltage processor that <span style="color:red" data-ts="129.755" data-end_ts="130.045" title="129.755" id=c_"129.755">__cont__</span> simultaneously controls for oscillators. I like to call it the world's most expensive Octo switch. But it's, if you can imagine two calibrated control voltage inputs taking a zero to eight volts, such of what comes from a keyboard or a sequencer. And you have four rows of knobs where you may quickly assign the octave shift with a twist of a knob, as well as fine tune vibrato amount and slew amount. There's onboard vibrato and slew generators, and really it's meant to tie together the behaviors for oscillators that may or may not be from the same manufacturer to quickly behave in a very controlled way in response to a set of input control voltages. Now, to make that a bit more interesting, I've set it up so that you can program semitone offsets for each of the four output channels that happen pre quantizer, and then those and other channel settings may be stored as presets and CVD through. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>So effectively it becomes a core generator if set up correctly. And there's also a series of gait and trigger inputs at the bottom, such as the quantizer trigger in and out for behavior like the, well-respected do <span style="color:red" data-ts="217.585" data-end_ts="217.805" title="217.585" id=c_"217.585">__for__</span> a 1 56 quantizer Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> a gate for <span style="color:red" data-ts="221.685" data-end_ts="221.805" title="221.685" id=c_"221.685">__SLU__</span> turning the slew signals on and off. And the thing I think that really ties the module together is the input swap gate input, which will change up the assignment of what input gets routed to which output channel. You, for example, you can't input A or BA plus B, and the gate will change that in a predictable way. So it's a means of, you know, temporarily overriding your sequence with manual keyboard play or simply really screwing up your control voltages experimentally with a single gate signal. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that sounds really interesting because it's sort of to, to do that kind of functionality now with your typical module set is actually kind of a pretty big chunk. You know, I'm just trying to, <span style="color:red" data-ts="270.525" data-end_ts="270.725" title="270.525" id=c_"270.525">__in__</span>, in my head, I'm kind of like thinking if I were to patch that up with my existing system, the number of different modules that would have to get involved just to pull off even part of it. So that's kind of cool that you're bringing that all together in one sort of front end processor. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>It's just makes it very quick to set up and repeatable for those who like to perform tuned musical activities using their oscillators. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Now, it's interesting you say it that way too, that it's, it's like around performance. Because one of the things I notice is a lot of people that perform live with their modules, modular systems tend to have a lot of your modules in their system. And I'm not, I mean, when I look at the modules, I find I find them compelling, but I'm not sure why it is that they've become such a staple for performance. Right? I mean, are you a performer yourself? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>I've really not had the time to do so since the, company has grown a little bit. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But I would love to perform more. Actually, the, the greatest motivator of any of my modular designs is live performance more so than circuitry or the algorithm. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's, that's interesting. 'cause it clearly, it that's clearly somehow like subliminally communicated because, well, and I think too, some of the issue is like the way that you do the controls, especially with those big bright orange knobs, it really does make it so that you can quickly identify where you're at. And also because each module has a very unique layout, you can even kind of like, again, almost subliminally you know, which module you're going after because they, each one has a clearly delineated, layout. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>Right. That's absolutely correct. What I try to do with each module is make it so that the, the knob layouts are, quite different from module to module, and there're different sizes <span style="color:red" data-ts="389.915" data-end_ts="390.205" title="389.915" id=c_"389.915">__with__</span> and heights of the knobs. I believe I'm working six different knob sizes now with the idea being to, you know, your hand can feel which module 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>Is underneath it without needing to read it. And the controls, I, I almost never put things in a grid arrangement or repeat more than five elements in a row so that if you've, practiced with the module for a couple days, then you will most likely understand the natural locations of each of the controls and the io. So you don't have to read the legend on the face plate once you've practiced with it for a little bit 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Now, the other thing I I remember from sort of like when you first started working with stuff is you were one of the first people to be willing to use sliders on modules, <laugh> Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, which, you know, when it made sense. And I, I thought that that too gave a really, you know, there's some real clarity in, in having certain parameters be slider based rather than knobs. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>I agree. I was kind of limited <span style="color:red" data-ts="460.805" data-end_ts="461.025" title="460.805" id=c_"460.805">__in__</span> my use of sliders in the very earliest days of the company when I was still hand building things and using a manual hole punch to prepare the face plates. But some companies that deal with metal photo process have since offered affordable machining services as well. So, and immediately as I got access to that, I started redesigning certain modules and replacing knob controls with sliders because, you know, I am a big fan of whatever designer at Roland decided that, you know, A DSR envelope controls should be sliders instead. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>And of course, for sequencers, the Times Safari <span style="color:red" data-ts="504.205" data-end_ts="504.425" title="504.205" id=c_"504.205">__Bar__</span> two was redesigned as a result of my ability to use sliders as well as the piston Honda Mark two, you can move as many sliders as you want with one hand motion where you can only really turn two knobs at once that way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>So there are certain parameters that are very appropriate for slider control, and I've thought quite a bit on that topic 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, when you first started the company, it was called, it was called The Harvest Man. Yes. Why did you change it? I had a number of people asking me to get you on the podcast, and as part of that, they all were like, find out why he's not called the Harvest Man anymore. <laugh>. So if you could explain <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>The company itself was started in 2007 as result of some projects I did as a graduate student at Northwestern University. Those were some very early versions of my first modular design, such as the algorithm Bit Crusher and the Zoro <span style="color:red" data-ts="570.885" data-end_ts="571.045" title="570.885" id=c_"570.885">__on__</span> Cannon Gate generator. And, you know, that project came about because we were, my friend <span style="color:red" data-ts="578.365" data-end_ts="578.525" title="578.365" id=c_"578.365">__Rin__</span> and I were playing in a large improv jazz group, and we got some access to some modular equipment there both through the school and, you know, increasing affordability of the dope <span style="color:red" data-ts="591.045" data-end_ts="591.245" title="591.045" id=c_"591.045">__for__</span> a 100 system. You know, our tastes really turned towards sounds and processes that weren't really represented in the modular space. So the Harvestman was more of a personal project that came out of my own academic work there. And then as well as, you know, sound material that were, was generated that way. But it kind of carried over as soon as I got out of the school and was immediately met with requests from a certain retailer to produce a number of these devices. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>So the name for the personal projects stuck with company for some time. The change to industrial music electronics started about two, two and a half years ago. And that's when I felt that the maturity of my Mark <span style="color:red" data-ts="639.665" data-end_ts="639.885" title="639.665" id=c_"639.665">__two__</span> line had, and I was more confident in my abilities as the designer and engineer. And that's when we made the decision to start the design of some guitar pedal designs, other ancillary devices. And our manufacturing setup had solidified with our cooperation with Dark Place. And also my aesthetic tastes have changed a bit towards, shall we say, industrial, both in reference to a ages old musical movement and that of industrial processes themselves. So I thought it was a good time for a change to represent our greater abilities and product design and, you know, the addition of the pedals. It's not just a modular company anymore. I thought it was a nice time to shake up the entire identity of things. And two years later, I think that's finally settled in. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. What's interesting is you kind of talked there a little bit about the getting started process for the, for the company. One of the things that's come up in a number of my prior interviews is people talking about your entry into the, into the module making thing is the thing that spurred them into believing that they could do it. Right. Because when you were, when you first started producing modules, you were kind of, other than, I mean, defer was doing his systems, but you know, at least to me, it seemed like at that, at that time, in that 2007 timeframe, nobody had really identified Euro as the thing. And there wasn't this, there wasn't really any other third party, manufacturers much to speak of at all 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>At the time when I started designing things, you know, modular, URAC Modular was obviously the most convenient platform to develop instrumental ideas because the mechanical and electrical specifications were very well-documented. And of course, the modular nature of the devices themselves just invites that kind of experimentation and design. But yeah, at the time, I think there was doper, they're the two British, systems and solutions manufacturers. Mike Brown and Peter Grenada had their companies then operating together as the ear group, whereas as Vox Glitch. And other than that, I'm not sure of a whole lot of people operating as organizations, a couple DIY things here and there. Of course, frack Rack was more of a concern at that point. At the time I started designing in 2006, it was, yeah, there wasn't a whole lot of a scene and most of that was driven by, you know, live Wire Plan B Ear group. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. And, and other than Live Wire, most of that stuff was pretty plain vanilla stuff. I mean, the, the things that Plan B was doing and, and the things that in defer offerings at the time were sort of like different versions of what, you know, earlier Roland Modular systems had kind of been Right. And so then I imagine you coming out with something like the algorithm just sort of, everyone was like, what the hell? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>Well, it was nice to, exist in the same design space as those guys as I was learning how to do things. You know, as soon as Mike Brown of Lifewire caught wind of some of the things I was working on, he, treated me to a very long phone call where he gave me a great, you know, set of advice about, you know, how to manufacture these things. Some tips for doing business with certain people, things like that. You know, his own designs are greatly influential on me. For example, the different knob sizes, the relation of location of a control voltage input Jack to its attenuator, which is a huge thing that I still hasn't, I don't think it's fully sunken in among the greater sphere. <span style="color:red" data-ts="887.405" data-end_ts="887.625" title="887.405" id=c_"887.405">__Now__</span>, the, the Livewire designs for, there are certain things that are nice, like the, you know, the Chaos computer, which finally saw released some years later. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>Yeah. The Plan B stuff was pretty nice because it was, we were still, you know, in the mid two thousands, there's still a point where, you know, the works of Don Ula West Coast synthesis designs or like that were really not all that documented, much less available for a lot of musicians to use. So a lot of Peter's work I think was really important in making, you know, things like the low <span style="color:red" data-ts="925.845" data-end_ts="926.135" title="925.845" id=c_"925.845">__pass__</span> gait or an oscillator with a nice sounding linear FM process. Right. That was really important to make that accessible in musicians. And that very quickly became part of my vocabularies. I was designing instruments for myself. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, and it's interesting you mentioned, oscillators though, because that, to me, when you started doing sound generators is when, at least in my recollection, you, you really came onto everybody's radar with the Hertz donut and the piston Honda. Those two seemed to be, that seemed like when, when those things came out, that seemed to like be in everybody's rack then. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah. The, very, very early on, as soon as I realized that I had the ability to develop ideas that could become modules, obviously the killer app would be a wave table oscillator with the same sort of aggressiveness as, for example, the Waldorf Microwave one or the Profit vs. Where the transitions between wave tables just has that bite to it. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I think in 2009 or that's when I was able to actually realize my first stable digital oscillator designs and offer them to others. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You ended up developing sort of a full range of modules so that you could basically have an entire system based off of your modules. Was that, did that at the time seem like an important goal or was it just something you wanted to do for you? Or did you really feel like there were holes in the market at the time that, that you needed to fill? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>Well, for the Mark one series that was, that one was a bit different because those, some of those were my very first designs. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> as a engineer, synthesis designer, and a lot of that I was learning as I was going along. And when I would need a new project to do, I would look at a different synthesis function that I haven't really thought of. And I would pursue a project if I could find a sort of character interface or other way of operating that wasn't adequately represented by things that were actually available. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Now, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1064.445" data-end_ts="1064.605" title="1064.445" id=c_"1064.445">__there__</span> wasn't a lot of modular out there in those days. It was my reaction to the avail availability. Other things is primarily against, you know, things with keyboards that only generate musical events in response to key presses or mid signals, and don't actually directly respond to physical displacement, like control voltages. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>So my own path of learning there was dictated by what I haven't done before and what really hasn't been explored in a certain way so that I may fill a hole for my own personal use. Now, as skills solidified, and I redesigned many things for the Mark two series, there was a much greater thought given the system level design, now that my modules were able to behave more consistently from one to the next, the graphic identity, the new graphic identity was chosen at that time to neatly separate the, various controls <span style="color:red" data-ts="1130.465" data-end_ts="1130.665" title="1130.465" id=c_"1130.465">__in__</span> the functional blocks and have their associated analog inputs and outputs relative to those controls. And at that point, I had also achieved full fluency and what control sizes I should use and what controls should have sliders. And we found some nice illuminated push buttons, which unfortunately only available in red and green color. But yeah, with the Mark two series, that's when things became thought of a lot more intensely as a system. And my own collaboration with Vladimir Uzman on the, poly <span style="color:red" data-ts="1166.725" data-end_ts="1166.945" title="1166.725" id=c_"1166.725">__Box__</span> series known as the Iron Curtain electronics, we had since redeveloped the schematics of the entire Polyx instrument at that time as a modular system. So we were able to get the full series out then. And of course, the graphic identity locations of certain controls were all consistent from mod module to module at that point. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So I'm gonna want to talk about the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1192.985" data-end_ts="1193.145" title="1192.985" id=c_"1192.985">__Paul__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1193.345" data-end_ts="1193.465" title="1193.345" id=c_"1193.345">__V__</span> experience in a little bit, but before we do that, one of the things that actually surprised me when I was, doing a little prep research is that you were a music major in college, and so this, all of this development and, and now you've kind of talked about it too. This development came, from a desire for a musical result, and then you learned the electronics necessary to do that. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>This is a fascinating area of discussion for me because, I certainly, you know, I was a musician long before I played with electronics. I found electronics very intimidating and it didn't sort, sort of follow the same logical function functions that I was used to in the rest of the world. Right. And so I, I really struggled in trying to learn electronics Now, you know, certainly when I tried there was a lot fewer resources than available now. But I'm curious what your path looked like in moving from being a musician with some interest in gear to being what you would, I mean, it sounds like you would now legitimately consider yourself an analog engineer. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>I have some analog skills and <laugh>, and in the background I'm working on legitimizing that engineer part of things. There 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You go. What's the path that you went through to get to this, to the point you are at now to, to sort of like the, the level of maker that you are now? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>Well, as a kid, I was never really all that successful in building radios or anything like that. I didn't have the best tools available to me. But I think the, the biggest first step was when my older brother received a Casio SK one and a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1300.345" data-end_ts="1300.565" title="1300.345" id=c_"1300.345">__and__</span> sos drum for Christmas in 1986. And as he reached adulthood, he moved out, left those things behind, and they became mine right around the time that I've discovered, Reed Zale's wonderfully written article about circuit bending <span style="color:red" data-ts="1316.825" data-end_ts="1317.045" title="1316.825" id=c_"1316.825">__the__</span> SK one, that single document is probably the biggest influence on me and really digging beneath the face plate to manipulate the stuff beneath it. So of course I circuit Ben that SK one and others that I collected. And that's when I really got the confidence of really just attacking a circuit in a really crude way and enjoying the results came from that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>Of course, I had a taste for the types of sounds that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1349.405" data-end_ts="1349.605" title="1349.405" id=c_"1349.405">__would__</span> result from that. Now, in 2005, I'd, I'd started experimenting with microcontrollers, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1358.955" data-end_ts="1359.245" title="1358.955" id=c_"1358.955">__Pick__</span> 18 series. And, you know, I thought about things like controlling old video game sound chips. My skills weren't up to that at that point, but I, you know, for the first time I discovered that, you know, my projects were powered up correctly and, and working just, you know, some trial and error experimentation. So I started writing very simple things in assembly on those <span style="color:red" data-ts="1384.925" data-end_ts="1385.205" title="1384.925" id=c_"1384.925">__pick__</span> chips. And after the summer, I was able to get back to Northwestern and make a large project <span style="color:red" data-ts="1392.925" data-end_ts="1393.245" title="1392.925" id=c_"1392.925">__outta__</span> that, which resulted in the world's first voltage controlled bit crusher, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1398.005" data-end_ts="1398.245" title="1398.005" id=c_"1398.005">__<inaudible>__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Awesome. How did your, like university advisors feel about you taking that on? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>Well, the, the large project was in the second year, my master's program. My advisor was Gary Kendall, who, in the past, he, took a leave of absence from his post at Northwestern to form a corporation that produced a 3D sound device using <span style="color:red" data-ts="1432.995" data-end_ts="1433.215" title="1432.995" id=c_"1432.995">__the__</span> Motorola 56 K series. And sometimes in our talks he, he talked about that whole experience, but surprisingly he was really excited to sign off on that project and just turn me loose, fleshing out anywhere from one to four designs and as a means of really pushing the idea of voltage controlled digital signal processing, as well as, you know, the interface concerns of a, a modular instrument that exists in hardware instead of, for example, super Collider program. I think that was interesting and different enough from the business as usual at that point that, you know, the, the department seemed to be happy to see me exploring that way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's interesting to me that you actually had advisors that, that were interested in it. Because in a lot of cases, music, music departments, especially big ones like Northwesterns can be, so I'll use the word Catholic, right. They could be so Catholic that, anything outside the norm is just un you know, it's not viable for them to even know how to talk about it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>Yeah. Northwestern, there was, there was at the time <span style="color:red" data-ts="1514.535" data-end_ts="1514.655" title="1514.535" id=c_"1514.535">__a__</span> quite a conflict between the orthodoxy of the administration and other departments and the real weirdos that we had in music technology and composition. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I suppose I should mention, Chris Mercer as well who came on as a lecturer right around the time that I joined as a graduate student. And he was very interested in the performance of, feedback processes. And my time with him was also very influential in developing my own feedback console arrangement <span style="color:red" data-ts="1548.095" data-end_ts="1548.255" title="1548.095" id=c_"1548.095">__of__</span> modules such as, you know, quad pedal amplifier that's normal to a matrix <span style="color:red" data-ts="1552.235" data-end_ts="1552.455" title="1552.235" id=c_"1552.235">__mix__</span> mixer, which feeds its signal back into the high game guitar pedals. We had a really good time doing a experimental music course where undergraduates were encouraged to play with contact mics and other transducers to generate very organic performance processes. That was probably a high point of my time there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I can see though too, how that would sort of have influenced your thinking and eventually getting you to make the, you know, put together the kind of processors that you had. 'cause you actually got to see some of that functionality in action through a lot of different people. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That it's, it sounds interesting and it sounds, but it also sounds like you're a really self-driven person, so you never really got any electronics education in any kind of traditional route at all then. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>I took an electronics course in high school, but that was at a time of extreme misbehavior. So myself and my classmates didn't really pick up anything beyond what we already knew from our own activities at home. But yeah, the electronic side of things is mostly self-educated, and I've, been fortunate to have certain crucial projects work correctly early on so that I was motivated to continue with more complicated things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I, I, I'm writing down the, the, phrase a time of extreme misbehavior because that <laugh> that is a, that's like a magical phrase because I think it's something that everyone can, can remember the point in their life where that would've been a great identifying sentence. That's awesome. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>There are these large wooden desks, right. And with large drawers <span style="color:red" data-ts="1670.555" data-end_ts="1670.795" title="1670.555" id=c_"1670.555">__that__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1670.815" data-end_ts="1671.035" title="1670.815" id=c_"1670.815">__may__</span> be, 10 inches tall, 18 inches deep. And, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1675.115" data-end_ts="1675.275" title="1675.115" id=c_"1675.115">__these__</span> DC power supplies went up to 40 volts. So, for example, daily ritual where we'd take some long leads from power supply and put 'em into the drawer and find the largest electrolytic cap that we could find, reverse the polarity and enjoy the popcorn smell that would happen after you could hear the pop down <span style="color:red" data-ts="1694.955" data-end_ts="1695.115" title="1694.955" id=c_"1694.955">__the__</span> hallway. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You know, it's, yeah. It's funny you say that. I think that in fact, anybody who wants, who thinks that they want to get into electronics, one of the first things they should do is just reverse polarity on a capacitor and just see what happens when, first of all, it blows up and a piece of metal goes flying across the room and you get that smell and there's some, you're either gonna be like, oh my God, I never want that to happen again. Or you're gonna say, Hmm, that's interesting, <laugh>, I get to get into this a little more <laugh>. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>Yep. And then there's of course the rite of passage where you get zapped and with the assistance and the voltage, you toss your tool farther than you would be able to normally <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, exactly. <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>Musculature is apparently capable of some wonderful feats of force, but sometimes I guess the brain is really up to that peak performance. Right. <laugh>, the direct current, I guess <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's great. That's when, that's one I haven't had the chance to do yet, but I'm, I'm also not looking forward to it either, so <span style="color:red" data-ts="1766.095" data-end_ts="1766.445" title="1766.095" id=c_"1766.095">__maybe__</span>, maybe that, maybe that's where I hit my limit with electronics. Now, one of the things I wanted to ask you about, well, there's a couple of things I wanted to ask you about. First of all, this idea of, of doing voltage control, digital processing, I mean the, the piston Honda and the Hertz donut kind of were like the sound generating parts of that, but you also did like the time, time safari, which was sort of like, you know, kind of a crazy Looper Me system. Obviously the algorithm doing its digital craziness. What was it that drew you to the digital side of it specifically? Again, was it just something that was different from what everyone else was doing, or did you find your voice in that digital <span style="color:red" data-ts="1811.675" data-end_ts="1811.965" title="1811.675" id=c_"1811.675">__anal__</span> analog combo? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>Really, I prefer the sounds of a lot of digital processes. You know, you can't really touch the aggressiveness of a roughly shifting wave table <span style="color:red" data-ts="1823.405" data-end_ts="1823.755" title="1823.405" id=c_"1823.405">__morph__</span> or, you know, certain bitwise operations on audio streams. Stuff like that really can't exist with the analog circuitry, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1834.535" data-end_ts="1834.755" title="1834.535" id=c_"1834.535">__not__</span> without extreme measures taken. And yeah, the lack of availability of musical instruments that allow you to quickly reach that point, like I, I like a lot of sounds of the digital keyboards, the late eighties and nineties, but once again, they have organ keyboards attached and they're really only responding slowly, responding to digital commands. And the idea of real <span style="color:red" data-ts="1858.835" data-end_ts="1859.035" title="1858.835" id=c_"1858.835">__time__</span> control is, afterthought. I, I came up during the, the era of the $150 wave station, which I thought was a great learning experience, and you know, I've had cheap profit vs as well collection of microwaves that no one wanted. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>But, you know, I think I also became more familiar with guitar technique starting around 2005. And the number of dimensions that you can affect the sound with just two hands is really, why can't you do the same with an, an electronic device? You can, you can program a patch with your envelopes, your modulators and everything. But as far as the real time control and everything, I don't think that's yet reached its maximum. We're still thinking in things of, you know, how many knobs or sliders can affect this thing instead of how can the system inside this device or this module, how can it be more readily opened up to respond environmental phenomena, most of that being through your chosen controller generating control voltage. But I see these modules, even if they're digital, they're physical systems that must be made to properly respond to their environment, much like a vibrating guitar string. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Most people that have that feel the call of that end up focusing on trying to build new control surfaces. So I just <span style="color:red" data-ts="1950.665" data-end_ts="1950.865" title="1950.665" id=c_"1950.665">__had__</span> I, while you were talking about that, I kinda looked over to the one wall of my studio where I have a push and a innovation circuit and a rolly squishy keyboard and regular keyboard and a mono button box and stuff like this. And I, and I realized that a lot of people who kind of hear the call of expressivity try and make a control surface. Is that something that you ever played around with? Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>I've played around with a lot of concepts off and on, a lot of things kind of dead <span style="color:red" data-ts="1981.745" data-end_ts="1981.965" title="1981.745" id=c_"1981.745">__end__</span> themselves that the whole, you know, imagine a very wide panel that may or may not sit inside a modular rack, you know, nicely <span style="color:red" data-ts="1990.915" data-end_ts="1991.405" title="1990.915" id=c_"1990.915">__champed__</span> cutouts that fit the shape of the human hand, things like that. I've had better ideas since then, which will happen at some point. But I really like, and other manufacturers have represented this quite well. I like to feel the forced sensing resistor, if you take the old quarter inch thick mouse pad material on attached to that, that's, that's my favorite touch technology right there. I think along those lines, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Because I was, I was wondering if, you know, you were ever drawn to anything like ULAs, you know, the, the thunder that was, I dunno that that didn't have the kind of response, you're right <span style="color:red" data-ts="2030.305" data-end_ts="2030.525" title="2030.305" id=c_"2030.305">__in__</span>, in a way, the amount of effort that has been put into like touchpad technology, <laugh>, you know, because they sell zillions of 'em. Right. So the amount of effort that they're putting into that is, clearly pays off in <span style="color:red" data-ts="2044.605" data-end_ts="2044.725" title="2044.605" id=c_"2044.605">__a__</span> extraordinarily responsive device. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>Yeah. I've drawn my share of Thunderbird sheep finger cutouts, and I'm sure a couple of us have, but I have a better idea now that hopefully I'll be able to realize next year. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that's great. I'm looking forward to seeing, to seeing what you come up with on that. Another area that you're well known for is this work on the OX series, which, and you do it under the, under the moniker of Iron Curtain Electronics, right? Yes. Could you explain more fully, first of all where that comes from in, the person that you work with on these designs? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>All right. Well, Vladimir Uzman is, a Russian electronics engineer who worked for the, it was a state radio factory in what is now a berg in, way out in the Euros in Russia. I'm not sure what his initial tasks in that factory were, but it came upon him to lead the teams that would design the musical instruments. So they did things like organs and amplifiers and string machines. But in 1982, they completed the poly vx, which was the first fully voltage controlled instrument in the Soviet economy. Those were available to cultural organizations through the shop system. There, there are other designers that made some vultures controlled synthesizers, which was in Russia. But I think think the poly vox was the first and the most complete as far as resembling what we know as a, a voltage controlled synthesizer. Now, due to the system there, these were military factories, primarily building radios and other electronic equipment. The finest electronic parts were reserved for the strictly military applications, of course. So, mm-Hmm, <affirmative>, the way I understand it, they kind of had the leftovers to work with, which explains, first of all, the really interesting nature of some of the electrical mechanical components like the rotary switches and the way that the knobs are fixed to the pot shafts. That's really interesting. If you ever have the opportunity to do a tear down of a poly <span style="color:red" data-ts="2185.065" data-end_ts="2185.285" title="2185.065" id=c_"2185.065">__box__</span>, I highly recommend it's, other worldly experience. It's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2189.955" data-end_ts="2190.565" title="2189.955" id=c_"2189.955">__Education__</span>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2190.625" data-end_ts="2190.845" title="2190.625" id=c_"2190.625">__Now__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>The, the design of the electronics themselves, I believe, was influenced by the, limited selection of parts. The vulture controlled filter works in a very unique way in that they're using the, some programmable operation, well amplifiers, they're using the, the programming pin to change the bandwidth of the amplifier itself. So there are no external capacitors in the filter core, and that's what leads to the really unstable feedback characteristic of that filter design. And they thought on the design for quite some time to arrive at the character that <span style="color:red" data-ts="2227.765" data-end_ts="2227.885" title="2227.765" id=c_"2227.765">__I__</span> want. But in the end, it was very simple, you know, two op operational amplifiers, six resistors, and then all the stuff around it to realize the voltage controllability. But the, the core itself is the two op amps and six resistors. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. It explains the very, I mean, it sounds different than anything else. It sounds a lot different than anything else, and that explains it a lot. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>Yeah. The, they did have access to whatever foreign patents they wanted, and like other instruments like the MS 20 that visiting musicians would bring in, like they'd borrow the MS 20 for a night and see how it worked. So Uzman and his team are very well aware of how synthesizers work and some of the things that they can do. But in their own designs, they were forced to come up with some very clever solutions to common problems. Like the oscillator is, there are no tempos in there, so they use negative temperature <span style="color:red" data-ts="2286.345" data-end_ts="2286.565" title="2286.345" id=c_"2286.345">__con__</span> compensation using a heated transistor array and pretty gnarly looking stack of resistors and tremors. But that oscillator design is as stable as any other well designed VCO. And there are other such clever things all throughout all the circuits that I've looked at. I mean, in some cases they could be inspired by Western designs, but there is a distinct quality and character throughout most electronic instruments I've inspected that have come from <span style="color:red" data-ts="2318.145" data-end_ts="2318.365" title="2318.145" id=c_"2318.145">__the__</span> Soviet <span style="color:red" data-ts="2318.855" data-end_ts="2319.205" title="2318.855" id=c_"2318.855">__block__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Now, I'm, it's, it's mind boggling to me that they, you know, there was a Soviet synth at all because we now have got this mythology of what the Soviet Union was like, and all we can imagine is, you know, people standing in front of gray buildings hoping to get a loaf of bread and Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So it doesn't seem to align with the idea of getting senses made, but of course, you know, society was society and so they had to do things. These, these things that they were making, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2348.605" data-end_ts="2348.885" title="2348.605" id=c_"2348.605">__were__</span> they generally like given to other, you know, like radio stations or universities, or is was it kind of like, an official government issued kind of a device? I, I assumed it wasn't like, Hey, musicians, come on by and get a synth. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>The, the way I understand it, first of all, the Poly <span style="color:red" data-ts="2369.325" data-end_ts="2369.445" title="2369.325" id=c_"2369.325">__V__</span> is priced so that it was a month or two salary for the average Russians. So, it was explained to me that, you know, the average Russian probably wouldn't be able to go and buy it in a store. I'm also not familiar with how these things were distributed into their shop system once they left the factory, but I know that the greatest customers of the Poly <span style="color:red" data-ts="2390.185" data-end_ts="2390.405" title="2390.185" id=c_"2390.185">__Box__</span> were cultural organizations and bands with state backing. Right. Things <span style="color:red" data-ts="2396.285" data-end_ts="2396.485" title="2396.285" id=c_"2396.285">__like__</span> that. Sure. I know that there are a whole bunch of really weird Russian stomp boxes that kind of look like, look like DOD pedals, for example, but different, there are other less expensive instruments. There seemed to be a full selection of electronic or guitar instruments of any type, but I suspect that the availability in the economy of them was quite different from what we're used to. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, how, when did you first run across Apollo <span style="color:red" data-ts="2423.645" data-end_ts="2423.765" title="2423.645" id=c_"2423.645">__V__</span> and you're kind of well known for like, enjoying an aggressive sound and you, you said as much during this chat and you know, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2432.125" data-end_ts="2432.445" title="2432.125" id=c_"2432.125">__Paolo__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2432.525" data-end_ts="2432.645" title="2432.525" id=c_"2432.525">__V__</span> would certainly, you know, then speak to that kind of internal voicing. But how did you run across one in the first place? How do you trip trip across an old Soviet <span style="color:red" data-ts="2444.585" data-end_ts="2444.805" title="2444.585" id=c_"2444.585">__sin__</span>? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>I'd actually not encountered one in real life until several years into my operation as a company. What happened was, Sean Cleary of Analog Haven wanted a, he really wanted a poly <span style="color:red" data-ts="2457.985" data-end_ts="2458.205" title="2457.985" id=c_"2457.985">__box__</span> module to exist. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2460.195" data-end_ts="2460.485" title="2460.195" id=c_"2460.195">__Yeah__</span>. I was familiar with the poly <span style="color:red" data-ts="2462.305" data-end_ts="2462.525" title="2462.305" id=c_"2462.305">__box__</span> circuit itself, just through my enthusiasm for synthesizers in general, as I learned about them, how to play them, how to design them. And eventually through his efforts to have someone or anyone make a poly <span style="color:red" data-ts="2477.425" data-end_ts="2477.645" title="2477.425" id=c_"2477.425">__box__</span> filter module, I was just coming with my bit crusher at that time, which he also wanted to buy. So he suggested that I begin a collaboration with Vladimir Uzman, who is a friend of his, Sean lived in Russia for a time, and he very generously set up that arrangement and it's turned into a very fruitful collaboration. Now Uzman and I work on adapting some of his circuits to guitar pedals, where appropriate 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sean Cleary, he's like the Pied Piper of the whole modular thing. Again, the number of people that point to his influence on helping them get started has been pretty amazing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>Yeah. He tries to have his irons and the fires <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2518.465" data-end_ts="2518.685" title="2518.465" id=c_"2518.465">__And__</span> he does. So now you're working with, with Vladimir, what is that collaboration like? Does he work on the circuitry or do you collaborate on the circuitry, or does he just have, have his designs that he wants to run with and you just help realize them as a product? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>Well, sometimes we talk about ideas. You know, he has a whole library of ideas that, you know, he's either personally designed himself or stuff that's fallen <span style="color:red" data-ts="2545.025" data-end_ts="2545.245" title="2545.025" id=c_"2545.025">__to__</span> into his hands after the collapse of the factory system. At the end of the USSR, he comes up with ideas of things that could sound interesting or things that he's designed that he's never actually listened to before, such as the sub octave circuit that we produce. That sounds amazing. And usually it happens, like if we can agree on something that might work as a modular pedal, he'll drop a modernized schematic that uses the old Russian parts where appropriate and substitute substitutes modern components to make the thing manufacturable otherwise. And then what I do is I draw upon my own experience as a modular player and designer, and I modify the interface. I do the front panel design, I arrange the controls in a meaningful way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>Sometimes I change the law of the controls so that they're greater sweet spots in the big knob travels. I add attenuators and range switches so that it makes more sense as a module rather than something that was once part of the keyboard. So our collaboration kind of happens that way. We do certain things and then we pass the work back to one another for further revision. Usually his schematics are great, you know, it's his idea as far as what the circuit does. So I don't often suggest changes to that. What I do is mostly interface related, which I think is the most pressing thing that must be addressed in any modular design, regardless of what the circuit does. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that makes a lot of sense though to me, because what I was gonna suggest was that despite the fact that two designers are responsible for the circuitry, other than <laugh> the different language used on the front panels, there's a sense of these all being of a thing. Right. And so that speaks to the fact that you've got your hand in that interface design, and again, a very performative interface. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>I've tried to arrange the controls such that, it doesn't matter what language the panel is in, if you've practiced with it to get your preferred range of sounds out of it, you shouldn't have to read the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2679.125" data-end_ts="2679.285" title="2679.125" id=c_"2679.125">__thing__</span> that was inspired. You know, as we've discussed before, I, I like things that aren't in a grid. I like knob layouts. So you can feel like certain synthesizers I've enjoyed in the past, my favorite ones have had different constellations of controls. Like, for example, the Axel Harts <span style="color:red" data-ts="2699.805" data-end_ts="2699.925" title="2699.805" id=c_"2699.805">__and__</span> Andromeda Constellation, I think was brilliant and a welcome departure from a lot of the stuff that he is done in grids. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, that's, that's a fact. And, and it's a great point. Now, you, you talk about venturing into the world of guitar pedals. What are you finding different in that world than you've experienced in the modular world? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>I see that most guitarists play the pedals <span style="color:red" data-ts="2726.245" data-end_ts="2726.465" title="2726.245" id=c_"2726.245">__as__</span> sort of a set and forget thing. A lot of my early experience playing guitar pedals without a guitar and self feeding feedback operations, you know, made use of the, the front panel controls as a, as a performance element. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I've since becoming more aware of how the thing is played, I've, I see, I dunno, it's hard to quantify the differences in how the controls must behave between a module and a pedal that do certain things, but I feel that the applications are entirely different and they must not behave the same. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, and also in a guitar pedal, you're, you're generally not going to get away with something like, oh, I don't know, you know, the layout <span style="color:red" data-ts="2782.185" data-end_ts="2782.405" title="2782.185" id=c_"2782.185">__of__</span> a hertz donut, which has like 2, 4, 6, 8, 9 knobs on it and switches and a whole bunch of jacks. You know, that that doesn't really work in a pedal format just from a layout standpoint or an accessibility standpoint even. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>Yeah, I see that now these days, you know, expression pedals are still quite a popular thing and that's the preferred interface to real time control <span style="color:red" data-ts="2806.735" data-end_ts="2806.935" title="2806.735" id=c_"2806.735">__this__</span> stuff where the expression, you know, a lot of times in more interesting pedals now you see that that expression signal <span style="color:red" data-ts="2813.715" data-end_ts="2813.935" title="2813.715" id=c_"2813.715">__can__</span> be routed to one or many parameters. And that's how that's accomplished. The, you know, the main controls with the really pretty knobs on them are set up to provide a nice baseline, and then the expression pedal and the guitarist <span style="color:red" data-ts="2831.905" data-end_ts="2832.185" title="2831.905" id=c_"2831.905">__zone__</span> interaction with the vibrating strings determines how that circuit will affect the tone. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now you talk about how you kind of grew up around the, around the more standard synthesizer keyboard kind of thing. Have you ever been tempted to try and make a black and white keys orange nobbed polysynth or anything like that?

<b>Scott: </b>I've fleshed it, you know, at this point in my career I've fleshed out a couple full instrument configurations, if you can call it that. There's one collaboration where it was suggested that there be an organ keyboard attached to which I felt kind of allergic to that. Mm-Hmm, <affirmative>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2878.115" data-end_ts="2878.405" title="2878.115" id=c_"2878.115">__Yeah__</span>. But, you know, for a company as small as mine, we've only got, we have a staff of four people here, and it's a bit hard to organize larger projects that scale. So all of my more integrated designs have been collaborations with other people. For example, we're working on, and we call them the four voice synthesizer groove box that I'm doing with mco, things like that, where there's, you know, five times as much hardware on the panel and the, the circuitry and the power supply demands are much higher than a modular. So yeah, I've, I've had ideas. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>I've come very close to finishing a bunch of them, but no, especially with the health of the modular market as it is, I think it's, I think I'll be focusing on that for a little while. And really this state of the market, the minute is something that I've been dreaming would happen for a very long time now at last modular patching and all the nice experimental devices that come along with it seems to be fully legitimized as what electronic instruments are, what the building blocks of the things that actually make the sound are, they're finally abstracted as modular units. And no longer are we subject to a larger company's marketing department telling us what kind of circuitry is or isn't too expensive to put in an instrument. Now there's healthy community and it really is a community of, smaller companies trying all kinds of crazy ideas and digging up old or unfashionable technologies to make really interesting things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>And most importantly, the musicians that take the risk to learn how to use these expensive devices. And finally making the kinds of real <span style="color:red" data-ts="2993.905" data-end_ts="2994.145" title="2993.905" id=c_"2993.905">__time__</span> performances that previously, previously only available to in instrumentalists such as guitarists. You with modular instruments, you have immediate control over so many dimensions of the sound. And with an adequate control setup, you may perform it fluently as well as anyone else. Like the act of performing electronic music is, you know, it's not tied down to a sequencer or whatever your workstation of choice is now. It's like anything else. It's an object that makes sounds that may be influ directly influenced in any number of ways. And I'm really glad that there is now a market that actually supports this idea to exist and is healthily growing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's interesting you say it that way too, because I, I, I'd never really thought about it that way, but, 'cause I've always thought of the, the real value of, of the modular thing as giving you the ability to make your own idiosyncratic instrument. And I think that's important. But you point to another thing, which is if you compare what someone doing a modular synthesizer based performance, how they're performing, it's a lot more like a guitarist than say a Jean-Michel Jarre or a, a craft work kind of performance. Right. It's not that it's not that stayed, you know, kicking off a sequencer, playing, playing the organ style keyboard and stuff like that. It's much more hands-on, it's, it's almost, it's like sloppier and dirtier in a way that's very, it's very not much not tied to a keyboard and a discreet on and off switch kind of a thing, but it's a lot more loose and, greasy like playing guitar. I'd never really thought of it that way, but that's, that's so true. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>Right. The oscillators oscillating whether you want it to or not. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>I think this over the last decade, the development of small format modulars is something that's accessible <span style="color:red" data-ts="3122.445" data-end_ts="3122.605" title="3122.445" id=c_"3122.445">__to__</span> many musicians. I think we just may arrive at the point where the nor modular G two is no longer the high water mark of our musical civilization. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Yeah. Well, that's, it is, an interesting thought. And again, I, you've kind of opened my head to, to thinking about things in more performative terms. I really like that. Now I'm curious to ask you what, you're about to produce this, the Argos bleak. What is, what are some of the things that you imagine for the near term future? Maybe not exact products, but like categories of things that you think represent the near term future? 'cause it seems like you have a very clear vision of what you would like to see the musical world do. What, what do you think, how do you think that translates into product like ideas? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>Well, I'm with the Mark two series, those, you know, were written in c with a nice compiler, so they're actually maintainable. And I'm always learning new tricks about things as I design new modules and fix problems with old ones. Still <span style="color:red" data-ts="3193.095" data-end_ts="3193.295" title="3193.095" id=c_"3193.095">__some__</span> hammer is a good experience 'cause everyone uses it differently and my users provide the most useful bug reports and feature suggestions to me. So I'm constantly on my feet with that one. But, you know, some of these designs are five years old now, and what's a modular is to people has changed a bit in that time. And the expectations of modules in my price range has also changed. So certain ideas get refreshed, like <span style="color:red" data-ts="3224.565" data-end_ts="3224.685" title="3224.565" id=c_"3224.565">__a__</span>, but the nice thing is the hardware of the old modules is capable. And some of the things I've learned, a lot of old things are currently undergoing some pretty substantial improvements. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>Like I'm doing complete rewrite of the time safari so that, you know, it's pitch shifting behaviors, better loop resolution is finer. I hope to produce some more of those someday. Like the hardware on that one is great as is from <span style="color:red" data-ts="3251.955" data-end_ts="3252.195" title="3251.955" id=c_"3251.955">__where__</span> it could stand to be improved. Stuff like that, you know, more stability on the Kermit. I have, general ideas that I'm thinking of lately is, you know, for things that load audio files or other data, it's not such a bad idea to have very limited displays or being able to read files off of a SSD card, for example. So I think further ideas, you know, my modules are gonna cost what they do simply because of how they're manufactured, the amount of metal that's on them and the amount of controls there. The guts really don't add all that much to the cost in some cases. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>So I've been thinking of more elaborate designs like that. And most, most importantly, the, you know, the algorithms are what they are, they can be improved over time. If it's a digital device, the most important thing to me is that the interface makes sense, is unique. You can feel it with your hand. You can see it in the dark 'cause of all, all the LEDs. But most importantly, you know, one control per function, no menu diving, stacking the thing does what it says on the panel. And that's that we, we give the user an idea to work with and that's what that particular piece of hardware does. So with that, we, I've learned a lot in the last decade and I hope to issue a series of modules over the next year that represent that experience that's more closely tailored to what the users would like to see in its performance capability. And Stilson Hammer's been a great learning experience for that 'cause we're always adding new features or tightening up little bugs that we never would've discovered otherwise. Our dialogue with customers is really good these days and it looks very positive going forward, especially with the health market as it is. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that's fantastic. I am looking forward to seeing what the, what more you bring to the, to the marketplace. But just as you, continue to tweak these things, it's really exciting to watch. Scott, I want to thank you so much for, again, taking the time outta your schedule. I know that you've got a lot going on at all times, but taking this time to talk. I, I really appreciate it man. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>Well thank you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3406.065" data-end_ts="3406.485" title="3406.065" id=c_"3406.065">__Having__</span>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="3406.485" data-end_ts="3406.645" title="3406.485" id=c_"3406.485">__Me__</span> on your wonderful podcast and as I look through the archive, I'm gonna have to listen to a bunch of these things myself. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright, well I'm looking forward to hearing your feedback on that. So with that, I will let you go on with your day. Thank you. And have a good one. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Scott: </b>All right, thank you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I want to thank Scott for, the great chat. It's really interesting to hear where he is coming from, how he's gotten involved in the <span style="color:red" data-ts="3439.065" data-end_ts="3439.285" title="3439.065" id=c_"3439.065">__OX__</span> stuff and just in general how he views the world of creating a performance interface for modular users. I love it. Thanks so much for continuing to listen. Thanks for sharing this with your friends and hang on. We've got more great stuff coming. Talk to you soon. Bye.
