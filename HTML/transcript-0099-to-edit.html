<b>Darwin: </b>Well, every once in a while, it turns out we get a chance to talk to our heroes. This week's interview podcast number 99, is with one of mine, Ian <span style="color:red" data-ts="18.115" data-end_ts="18.405" title="18.115" id=c_"18.115">__Body__</span>, the head of the din label, but also an extraordinary musician. I was so happy that he was willing to talk, and I hope you enjoy this chat with 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today, I'd like to, introduce you to somebody for whom I'm a fan. It's really exciting to get to talk to Ian <span style="color:red" data-ts="39.885" data-end_ts="40.165" title="39.885" id=c_"39.885">__Body__</span>. Ian is, the head of DIN Records, which is a label that I love. He is <span style="color:red" data-ts="49.265" data-end_ts="49.485" title="49.265" id=c_"49.265">__on__</span>, he, he's put out a ton of releases. He, to me, kind of defines the modern version of, classic electronic music. He does sound design, he does all kinds of stuff, and, I am really excited to have him on the podcast. So, with that, I would like to say hi to Ian <span style="color:red" data-ts="69.525" data-end_ts="69.725" title="69.525" id=c_"69.525">__Body__</span>. Hi, how are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ian Boddy: </b>I'm fine, thank you. Yes. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Great. So I kind of started blurting out the stuff you do, but maybe what I'll do is I'll let you kind of talk about, the things that you do and the things that, kind of make up your career. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ian: </b>Yeah. I guess I've got three, three prongs to the attack, as it were, <span style="color:red" data-ts="93.265" data-end_ts="93.685" title="93.265" id=c_"93.265">__trying__</span> to make, a living full time. I've, being a musician's obviously quite hard. It's not getting any easier as well, so it's good to have more than one iron and fire, as it were. So you mentioned din. So yes, I run din and of course that means I <span style="color:red" data-ts="108.845" data-end_ts="109.085" title="108.845" id=c_"108.845">__used__</span> my own stuff in there, plus other musicians and also myself in collaboration with other musicians and playing concerts. That's, that, that's one thing. The second thing was the sound design you mentioned that involves, programming patches for mainly subs, synthesizers doing, contact, li libraries of sounds where I'm, I'm designing my own sounds a lot from the, analogs and I've got, and then the third, line of attack is I write, production, soundtracks for a company called ul, and that's music that may get used on TVs, films, documentaries, <span style="color:red" data-ts="146.845" data-end_ts="147.045" title="146.845" id=c_"146.845">__whatever__</span>. So <span style="color:red" data-ts="147.945" data-end_ts="148.165" title="147.945" id=c_"147.945">__pat__</span>, those three activities that keeps me pretty busy. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, indeed. Now you have, you have what could almost be labeled countless releases. How many different releases have you been involved in? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ian: </b><laugh> I can't remember. <laugh> you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Can't remember either. Okay. Yeah, it's a 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ian: </b>Lot. Well, I mean, d gosh, obviously Dins approaching 50 releases on physical format. Not all those are mine. Right. I would guess I've probably been involved either solo on collaboration with at least 35 to 40 air releases over the years, and that's not including obviously all the, <span style="color:red" data-ts="184.965" data-end_ts="185.205" title="184.965" id=c_"184.965">__live__</span> music work that I've done as well. So if you, if you count those, it's gonna be well over 50 air releases. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ian: </b>But I I, I, <span style="color:red" data-ts="192.825" data-end_ts="193.045" title="192.825" id=c_"192.825">__no__</span>, no, <span style="color:red" data-ts="193.425" data-end_ts="193.645" title="193.425" id=c_"193.425">__put__</span> intended. I I I lose track <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, I'll bet. I mean, it's, you have got an incredible body of work now. What I like doing in the podcast is I, I don't tend to focus on things like gear and stuff like that. I am, I tend to focus more on, yeah. I tend to focus more on how people got started and how they keep going. And in your case, you are constantly busy. I mean, it <span style="color:red" data-ts="222.285" data-end_ts="222.325" title="222.285" id=c_"222.285">__is__</span> been very difficult to, to kinda wedge a corner of your schedule because you are a busy, busy person. So what, what I'm curious about is what are your beginnings? What is your background? What got you to be the artist that you are? And, and especially like from your musical background, where, where did that come from? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ian: </b>Well, <span style="color:red" data-ts="246.125" data-end_ts="246.285" title="246.125" id=c_"246.125">__in__</span>, in fact, I didn't have any musical background when I was young. I, I wasn't, I, I dropped <span style="color:red" data-ts="250.205" data-end_ts="250.365" title="250.205" id=c_"250.205">__the__</span> IT school. I didn't learn an instrument. I'm completely self-taught, if anything I was better in, in, in art. I was actually quite good in art in, sciences as well. So obviously all the careers advice you get in those days was science <span style="color:red" data-ts="264.735" data-end_ts="265.085" title="264.735" id=c_"264.735">__think__</span> to <span style="color:red" data-ts="265.205" data-end_ts="265.325" title="265.205" id=c_"265.205">__do__</span>. That's where you're gonna get a job. There's no point in doing art. But if you, if you go to art, you <span style="color:red" data-ts="268.445" data-end_ts="268.605" title="268.445" id=c_"268.445">__go__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="268.605" data-end_ts="268.725" title="268.605" id=c_"268.605">__to__</span> art. So I kind of did art my spare time when I was at, sixth form. And also when I was at, university, studying of all things biochemistry, which obviously I don't use a lot now, but there you go. And, I was certainly in that, in, in that time, sort of mid to late night, seventies of <span style="color:red" data-ts="288.505" data-end_ts="288.725" title="288.505" id=c_"288.505">__iga__</span> Pardon? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ian: </b>Into the music of their Tangerine Dream and Klau Schultz and Asua and Van <span style="color:red" data-ts="295.085" data-end_ts="295.205" title="295.085" id=c_"295.085">__Les__</span> and all, all all these bands. I loved that kind of stuff. Right. And while I was at university doing screen printing in an art studio, EDMI spare Time, somebody told me that there was a sound studio upstairs, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="306.965" data-end_ts="307.165" title="306.965" id=c_"306.965">__that__</span> had some of the gear that bands like <span style="color:red" data-ts="309.105" data-end_ts="309.325" title="309.105" id=c_"309.105">__Tan__</span> Tangerine reused. This was the VVCS three synthesizer. Right. So if I walked one day, got <span style="color:red" data-ts="315.365" data-end_ts="315.445" title="315.365" id=c_"315.365">__the__</span> guy <span style="color:red" data-ts="315.565" data-end_ts="315.725" title="315.565" id=c_"315.565">__to__</span> show me these sounds <span style="color:red" data-ts="316.365" data-end_ts="316.565" title="316.365" id=c_"316.365">__that__</span> these machines could make, and this may sound like a cliche, I was just hooked. I thought this was fantastic, <laugh>. And within the space of about a month, I literally had packed all my screen printing stuff away and started to work in sound, just experimenting with tapes and tape loops, VCs, threes really <span style="color:red" data-ts="335.205" data-end_ts="335.405" title="335.205" id=c_"335.205">__old__</span> synthesizers. And that was probably in 1979. And I just haven't stopped since, I've had regular jobs until about, 30 or 14 years ago. I ran all this alongside a regular job to earn me an income. But about that time period ago, I made the plunge, and decided to go full-time and have a look back. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. What part of your, the many things that you do actually precipitated you being a full-time musician? Was it the library work or the sound design, or the actual music releases? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ian: </b>Yes. First time. The music for the commercial work I do for TV and documentary and film work that earns me the lion share of my income. Sure. Without that, I mean, there's no one can run a label such as d an independent small niche label and make enough to really live off. Sure. I don't get me wrong, or don't get me wrong. It's, there's, okay. I earn quite a bit of it, but not enough to earn a single income off that. Right. I do dinging more for the love of it, <laugh>. I do sound design 'cause I like messing around with cool sounds. And I do the commercial work for <span style="color:red" data-ts="406.245" data-end_ts="406.365" title="406.245" id=c_"406.245">__De__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="406.365" data-end_ts="406.525" title="406.365" id=c_"406.365">__Wolf__</span>. 'cause obviously that pays, a set that pays a decent amount as well. All three added together earns me <span style="color:red" data-ts="412.245" data-end_ts="412.365" title="412.245" id=c_"412.245">__an__</span> income. But certainly the production mu music earned me enough to enable me to go full time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That makes a lot of sense. Now, doing library music as well as all of the releases that you've done, that doesn't that have the potential of sort of like tapping out your creative juices? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ian: </b>It may have the potential, but the different kind of, disciplines, to be honest. The <span style="color:red" data-ts="438.845" data-end_ts="439.045" title="438.845" id=c_"438.845">__lab__</span>, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="439.485" data-end_ts="439.645" title="439.485" id=c_"439.485">__lab__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="439.675" data-end_ts="439.965" title="439.675" id=c_"439.675">__meat__</span> is quite good in a way. 'cause obviously a lot of electronic guys, they do long <span style="color:red" data-ts="444.965" data-end_ts="445.085" title="444.965" id=c_"444.965">__p__</span> pieces. You can go on for a long time and the piece <span style="color:red" data-ts="448.025" data-end_ts="448.245" title="448.025" id=c_"448.025">__can__</span> be 10 minutes, 20 minutes long. So when you have to work to a two and a half to three minute brief with a proper ending in that as well, it's a completely different discipline to the more self-indulgent stuff that you can get up to on, din and such, such, such things so <span style="color:red" data-ts="463.045" data-end_ts="463.205" title="463.045" id=c_"463.045">__that__</span> the two don't overlap that much. But if you're a creative person, you're just a creative person. Some days the ideas might not flow, the ideas they just do. So, you just, you just kind of do it. To be honest, <span style="color:red" data-ts="477.605" data-end_ts="477.725" title="477.605" id=c_"477.605">__I__</span> quite, you can't quite pin down how and why you just do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That's, that's great. So what do you do then to kind, what do you do away from music to kind of refresh yourself? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ian: </b>I like to walk a lot in the countryside. Bird, bird, bird watching. I like a lot. Just those kind <span style="color:red" data-ts="495.405" data-end_ts="495.485" title="495.405" id=c_"495.405">__of__</span> things. Chilling out, drinking nice wine in beer, cook cooking, nice, cooking, nice food, reading books that, that kind of thing. Just, just, just to chill. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's, that sounds very, very nice and live in a nice spot to be able to do it. Now, one of the things that I, I really wanted to talk to you about, because I find it fascinating. When you look at the din labels releases, an extraordinary number of them are collaborations and collaborations with some amazing people and collaborations. Some of the collaborative work is some of the, some of the most interesting music that I listen to. Some of the stuff that I most enjoy. So like, your collaboration with Robert Rich or with Marcus Yeah. Are just, are just some of my favorite things that have been released. Period. First of all, how do you put yourself in a position to get the opportunity to collaborate with these people? I mean, do they come to you? Do you search them out? Or how does that work? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ian: </b>A lot of it's word, word of mouth. Marcus, writer <span style="color:red" data-ts="562.545" data-end_ts="562.765" title="562.545" id=c_"562.545">__you__</span> mentioned Yeah. Was actually one of the first, I was the first musician that collaborated on with the Distant Rituals album D too, the second ever release. He was recommended by a mutual friend called Sid Smith, who was kind of helped me at the beginning to set up <span style="color:red" data-ts="577.125" data-end_ts="577.245" title="577.125" id=c_"577.125">__d__</span> in terms of how I was thinking. He was a good sounding board so I could talk to Sid about what I wanted to do. And he knew of Marcus, who was quite young at the time, and put me in touch <span style="color:red" data-ts="586.285" data-end_ts="586.485" title="586.285" id=c_"586.285">__with__</span> Marcus, who sent me over. I hadn't heard of Marcus. <span style="color:red" data-ts="588.345" data-end_ts="588.565" title="588.345" id=c_"588.345">__He__</span> sent me over some tracks using his sound, his loops on his guitar, his touch guitar. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And they were just so cool, <laugh>. They were just so cool. And we got in touch and we, we, we work extremely well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ian: </b>He's a completely different style of musician than me, but that's really good. I think we compliment each other very well. So <span style="color:red" data-ts="605.725" data-end_ts="605.845" title="605.725" id=c_"605.725">__we__</span> like Robert, I'd met Robert at various trade shows. The, NAMM trade show when I was working for <inaudible>, which was one of my full-time jobs going across to Los Angeles to go to the NAMM Show. I met Robert over there, and obviously we knew of each other's stuff. And again, we come from two different kind of styles of electronics. But again, we just got on really well. And for those three albums, and we did, it was really good. And, but the guys like Mark Shri, who <span style="color:red" data-ts="629.605" data-end_ts="629.725" title="629.605" id=c_"629.605">__I__</span>, I worked with with <span style="color:red" data-ts="630.925" data-end_ts="631.045" title="630.925" id=c_"630.925">__a__</span> mark for a long, long time, since the early 1980s when, coincidentally, we were both on a, a little cassette label in the uk. So a lot of it's word of mouth. I don't really seek people out as such. But you come across people in your, travels and some people you just gravitate towards. You just have a, a connection and it, it, it, it just works. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, it's interesting you mention, mention, your work with Mark Shrieve as well. I I, that also is among some of my favorite work, and I just tend to listen to a lot of your stuff. So there you go. Now, I'm curious, when you work with, when you work in these collaborations, do you ever work face-to-face? Or is it all exchanging files? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ian: </b>To be honest, most of it's face-to-face. Even with Robert Rich, really right across in San Francisco. Yeah. The first, first two albums, I flew over to his, his place in just south, south of San Francisco. And worked over there and I think on Outpost, actually, he was also in the UK doing, or close to the UK doing some concerts. So he came to my place. I see Mark's not so bad 'cause he's just down, he's in the uk. Right. Most of what I do with Marcus has been face to face. I'd much prefer, it's not always possible, but wherever possible, I would prefer to do face <span style="color:red" data-ts="708.965" data-end_ts="709.165" title="708.965" id=c_"708.965">__to__</span> face. Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="709.885" data-end_ts="710.165" title="709.885" id=c_"709.885">__Because__</span> when you're in the same, when you're in the same physical space, you kind of bounce ideas off each other and the, it just, things just happen, which wouldn't happen in a, a purely virtual way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I, I agree. And in fact, most of the instances where I've tried to do, remote work by exchanging files has been an abject failure because there's nobody's eyes to look into to know what's coming next, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ian: </b>Yeah, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Beyond, beyond Robert and Marcus, who are, are my two favorites of your collabs, what are some other collaborations that you've done that really, really jump out at you as having been very successful? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ian: </b>Eric Olo, I think The Frontiers album, I think that was a particularly good one. It's the only, direct collaboration we did. Although we actually did release, a download only album of our performance, which we played at the, electric Circus Festival. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So I think the one with Eric was very good. We, we both come from similar climbs in, in the North, so I think we had a kind of a similar vision to the kind of sound we wanted. And that, that, <span style="color:red" data-ts="779.645" data-end_ts="779.885" title="779.645" id=c_"779.645">__yeah__</span>, that one worked, very well. I think. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>When you're doing this stuff, do you tend to work in a studio or do you try and find, so it sounds like maybe like with some of these, you have, you either go to people's, to their home studio or their working studio, or they come to yours. Have you ever done any collaborations, like just in a hotel room or done live recordings or anything like that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ian: </b>Well, not, not <span style="color:red" data-ts="806.125" data-end_ts="806.245" title="806.125" id=c_"806.125">__on__</span> a hotel room live <span style="color:red" data-ts="807.005" data-end_ts="807.365" title="807.005" id=c_"807.005">__record__</span>. Certainly there, there's quite a few of the, the did albums, <span style="color:red" data-ts="810.965" data-end_ts="811.085" title="810.965" id=c_"810.965">__a__</span> Performances Live, there's several of the ARC concerts Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> have being released. Like, like, like the One Church, which was the concert we did across in Philadelphia for, <span style="color:red" data-ts="820.845" data-end_ts="821.045" title="820.845" id=c_"820.845">__Chuck__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="821.195" data-end_ts="821.485" title="821.195" id=c_"821.195">__Chuk__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="821.645" data-end_ts="821.925" title="821.645" id=c_"821.645">__<inaudible>__</span>. The one <span style="color:red" data-ts="823.205" data-end_ts="823.325" title="823.205" id=c_"823.205">__of__</span> 'em <span style="color:red" data-ts="823.485" data-end_ts="823.565" title="823.485" id=c_"823.485">__just__</span> mentioned with Eric, the AC 12 release, that was a live release. So <span style="color:red" data-ts="827.625" data-end_ts="827.845" title="827.625" id=c_"827.625">__as__</span> one of the releases with Robert Rich, react, the third one that was also a concert in Philadelphia. Interesting. So sometimes you meet it for a, sometimes you meet it for a concert, and the performance you do at the concert is unique. So that's often worth documenting and releasing as an album as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, one of the things that you said when you talk about some of these successful collaborations is that there's a significant difference between kind of how you approach music or the music that's in your head and the person that you're working with. What are the ways that, when you first sit down with a collaborator, with a new collaborator, how do you kind of map out those differences? Do you talk about it? Do you just play for each other? Do you try ideas and, and how do you, and especially I'm curious, how do you reject ideas that didn't seem to go the right way? Do you make the decision? Do you share the decision? How does that work? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ian: </b>No, no. We share the, decision. It's an interesting question. I'm trying to think of some examples here. Without post, here's an interesting one, and this is a good way when you are working with another musician who's really clued in how you can come up with something you wouldn't have thought of doing in the first place. 'cause in a way, the most interesting ideas are things you wouldn't have thought of if you <span style="color:red" data-ts="905.365" data-end_ts="905.445" title="905.365" id=c_"905.365">__were__</span> working part. And it's even things you didn't even talk about. So the first, album Outpost with Robert Rich, we, we'd kind of <span style="color:red" data-ts="914.285" data-end_ts="914.445" title="914.285" id=c_"914.285">__talked__</span> roughly what kind of sound the world we were <span style="color:red" data-ts="916.045" data-end_ts="916.165" title="916.045" id=c_"916.045">__going__</span> use. And yeah, I knew I, I wanted to use his <span style="color:red" data-ts="917.885" data-end_ts="918.125" title="917.885" id=c_"917.885">__blist__</span> guitar, 'cause his <span style="color:red" data-ts="918.805" data-end_ts="919.045" title="918.805" id=c_"918.805">__blist__</span> guitar sound, it's just a wonderful signature sound he used, but we didn't want on every track, but we wanted to use that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ian: </b>So we kind of talked about those kind of things. But I arrived at his studio and unbeknownst to me his acoustic, little baby grand, piano he had there, he prepared it <span style="color:red" data-ts="933.705" data-end_ts="933.925" title="933.705" id=c_"933.705">__all__</span> John Cage by putting rubbers between him, between the strings, <laugh>. Now I love the <span style="color:red" data-ts="938.205" data-end_ts="938.365" title="938.205" id=c_"938.205">__summer__</span> piano, and I think at some point in our conversation we'd talked about this, but I didn't know he did this. And I sat down at the piano and surprise, surprise, it was the prepared pianist and whether the strings, you mute the strings by putting the rubbers between the strings. Right. And that became, that became a little signature sound on that album, which, which I played at. It's, it's at the very beginning of the album. It's at the very end. It like, kind <span style="color:red" data-ts="960.965" data-end_ts="961.045" title="960.965" id=c_"960.965">__of__</span> bookend the album. And that was a nice little idea that you just would never get if you were working apart. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ian: </b>Right. And it wasn't discussed. It was almost like a surprise that he set for me. And then I reacted in a, I, I reacted to that in a very pos positive way. But a lot of these things you don't really need to discuss. You just kind of know between the two of you, you kind of look at each other and you go, yeah, that's cool. Or you go, nah, that isn't working. There's never, I don't think I've ever had an argument with any of the musician on din where one of us really wanted to do something and another one really didn't. It's usually kind of like a, almost an unspoken, unspoken bond. You just know when something is working. Sure. You can't, you can't really quantify it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well that's, that's really interesting. And that really, that really speaks a lot too to your choices of collaborators because that kind of, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1014.525" data-end_ts="1014.645" title="1014.525" id=c_"1014.525">__that__</span> quite value. Yeah. That kind of unspoken communication is hard to come by on just rank strangers. Now I am curious about another thing. So you have a lot of releases as we both now have mentioned almost countless <laugh>. I am curious, I'm curious about something because it's something I and a lot of other electronic musicians struggle with, and you don't seem to have a struggle with it. And that is deciding that something is done and deciding that something's is ready for release. What are the processes that you go through in your own head to basically say, I've worked on it, I've worked on it enough, it's ready to go out the door? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ian: </b>Well, the honest answer is it's difficult to quantify. Again, I just know after all these years, intuition is something that's quite important. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1070.545" data-end_ts="1070.765" title="1070.545" id=c_"1070.545">__You__</span>, I just know when something's finished <span style="color:red" data-ts="1072.665" data-end_ts="1072.885" title="1072.665" id=c_"1072.665">__off__</span>, often less is more. And sometimes you just don't need to keep putting things on a track often. You know, I, I don't necessarily finish a track on the day I'm working on it. It may rest around for a bit and I may go back to it, but I don't try to overwork something. Obviously there's technical things you have to do at the end. You have to <span style="color:red" data-ts="1089.965" data-end_ts="1090.165" title="1089.965" id=c_"1089.965">__ma__</span> and you have to eq and compress and ma and master the sound. But those are purely technical things. So it's very difficult to answer your question. Going back to when I worked with the various, collaborators, you just kind of know. I mean, I know that's no help to you in a way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ian: </b>But it, but it, but it, it's unquantifiable. You just know when something is finished. And indeed finishing a piece and actually getting it out is often the hardest thing. And I know of lots of friends who are electronic musicians or who, or, or even other styles who've got a stack of stuff on tape or, or da or or CDR <span style="color:red" data-ts="1123.985" data-end_ts="1124.205" title="1123.985" id=c_"1123.985">__or__</span> whatever. And they never put these things out 'cause they never seem to get around to finishing something <laugh>. Mm-Hmm. So it's probably quite a useful skill I've got, but how I would quantify it, I've really got no idea. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see. Well, it is, it is interesting though. I mean, I, you can add me to the list of people who have a ton of recorded material that's not released. It's maybe one of the reasons why I have steered more towards live performance. Because in live performance you do it and then you've pushed it out there and, whatever it was, it was. And, that's, that's the limit of what you can add to it. Right. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ian: </b>That, that, that's another approach <span style="color:red" data-ts="1159.285" data-end_ts="1159.485" title="1159.285" id=c_"1159.285">__of__</span>, of course, playing live. But it, it's, it's in some ways, not every track, but often I use this phrase, I paint pictures and sound right. So sometimes I'll literally, I literally have a picture in my head of the track. It's already composed, it's actually in my head. All I've gotta do is to get it out of my head through the keyboards and various synthesizers on the hard drive of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1179.845" data-end_ts="1180.005" title="1179.845" id=c_"1179.845">__it__</span>, the door. And to actually, get it down there. So often, I actually already know what a track's gonna be like before I even start. As I said, not every track, but quite often I do have a, an idea in my head. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Do you ever have tracks in your head that don't match your style? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ian: </b>Probably not. No. <laugh> It's difficult to say, well, it's typical <span style="color:red" data-ts="1199.305" data-end_ts="1199.525" title="1199.305" id=c_"1199.305">__the__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1199.565" data-end_ts="1199.685" title="1199.565" id=c_"1199.565">__c__</span> what matches my style. 'cause of course I've <span style="color:red" data-ts="1201.805" data-end_ts="1201.885" title="1201.805" id=c_"1201.805">__to__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1201.885" data-end_ts="1202.045" title="1201.885" id=c_"1201.885">__know__</span> quite a wide range that that's true. Not everything I do sounds the same. So, and in fact, I'm not gonna give anything away, but I do have <span style="color:red" data-ts="1210.645" data-end_ts="1211.005" title="1210.645" id=c_"1210.645">__something__</span> planned, which I think may take quite a lot of people by surprise. I'm not saying it's the completely new, but it's certainly a lot different to what I've been putting out over the last few years. That that'll be interesting to see how people react to that. But I'm not giving anything away just at the moment. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Okay. I would say that that of the, again, using sort of like the classic electronic music framework as as a style, I feel like you, you have bounced around many different boundaries of that style. Right. And I think some of it is because of the collaborations, but I think some of it is because you're not afraid to, to try something new or try something a little different. And so it's kind of good to hear that you're, you're still willing to push yourself. I mean, it would've been very easy for you at some point to just say, well, I'm just gonna start, kind of like shooting out, Berlin School things. And you know, the people that love them <span style="color:red" data-ts="1267.125" data-end_ts="1267.365" title="1267.125" id=c_"1267.125">__will__</span> love them, but you've always kind of pushed different boundaries. And I've always found that really interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ian: </b>Well, I think you have to, for my own, my own peace of mind and, solidity, I would just get bored to be honest. I mean, the Berlin School side of things is obviously the background where I grew up being, I mean, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1284.085" data-end_ts="1284.365" title="1284.085" id=c_"1284.085">__being__</span> across over here in the UK and stuff, that's the music that I heard. So obviously the stuff I do with Mark, mark Shreve is a, that's very much in that kind of style. Right. And that, that, that's, it's great fun to do. Mark's a great, great friend. Him, he isn't to work with, he's got this wonderful big old vintage <span style="color:red" data-ts="1303.675" data-end_ts="1303.965" title="1303.675" id=c_"1303.675">__Moog__</span>. So we, we can get that sound. None of the virtual things <span style="color:red" data-ts="1307.505" data-end_ts="1307.725" title="1307.505" id=c_"1307.505">__are__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1307.745" data-end_ts="1307.965" title="1307.745" id=c_"1307.745">__or__</span> you, we, we can get the exact sound those guys got. We've got the big Moog and it just sounds so cool. Right. But I wouldn't want to do that all the time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ian: </b>And obviously working with Marcus and, and, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1318.505" data-end_ts="1318.725" title="1318.505" id=c_"1318.505">__and__</span> Robert Rich musicians like that, you can go in a completely different world. But coincidentally, course both Marcus and Robert are more guitar based. They play keyboards as well, but often the guitar's more of a focus of what they have, but they don't play guitar in a straightforward guitar way. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1335.085" data-end_ts="1335.285" title="1335.085" id=c_"1335.085">__Obvious__</span>. Obviously, Robert, if he's Gli guitar, and Marcus, if he's, he's, he's loops. So that's very interesting. And in fact, one of the things I wanted to do with DIN was to encourage not only myself to work with other musicians, but other collaborations to form from other groups of people who have been on din. So Eric Olo and Bernard Rech, for example, Lee worked together a few times. So that's kind of cool, getting different musicians to work together and you just never know what's gonna come out. Often when I start an album with Robert or or Marcus or somebody like that, I've got, you don't really know how it's gonna end up. Right. I know, I know before I said I often have things in my head, but not so much when you work with somebody else. And in fact, it's much more fun not knowing how it's going <span style="color:red" data-ts="1378.765" data-end_ts="1378.885" title="1378.765" id=c_"1378.765">__to__</span> turn out than knowing how it's gonna turn out in those, examples. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Because then the music ends up becoming one of actions and reactions and Yeah. That's again, where you're gonna get something that you could have never planned. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ian: </b>That's correct. Yeah. I mean, there's a certain amount of planning, but a lot of it is, a lot of it happens on the hoof and, there's been some really wonderful musical surprises along the way, and that's one of the things that does keep me fresh. I just, I couldn't, I'm not a musician who could just put the same style out. I don't think it's physically possible <laugh>, because I've been <span style="color:red" data-ts="1413.685" data-end_ts="1413.845" title="1413.685" id=c_"1413.685">__really__</span>, I've been putting out, I've been putting out stuff for over 35 years now. So to do the same for that length of time would be, you know, not very interesting. Certainly not for me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Now you have, you are kind of one of the elder statesmen of electronic music, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1432.585" data-end_ts="1432.805" title="1432.585" id=c_"1432.585">__the__</span> fuck <laugh>. Yeah. Well, and, but in an environment that has become very much a mainstream environment, again, I mean with dubstep and, some of the techno styles as well as what people are doing with hip hop and stuff like that. In, in many cases, these things are really very much, informed by electronic music principles that you and your friends and your collaborators and stuff developed many, many <span style="color:red" data-ts="1462.765" data-end_ts="1462.885" title="1462.765" id=c_"1462.765">__years__</span> ago, many years <span style="color:red" data-ts="1463.565" data-end_ts="1463.605" title="1463.565" id=c_"1463.565">__ago__</span>. What, what of that kind of genre or, or of those genres, what is out there that you find really interesting? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ian: </b>There's a few things. I mean, I like, let think, let me think. I like Boards of Canada. I think they do some great stuff. Yeah. That, that's a very distinctive sound. It's been much, copied, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1486.075" data-end_ts="1486.365" title="1486.075" id=c_"1486.075">__load__</span>. It's not strictly electronic. A lot of the stuff that, Neils <span style="color:red" data-ts="1489.645" data-end_ts="1489.845" title="1489.645" id=c_"1489.645">__from__</span> does on the erase tape stuff. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, that's real. Some really cool stuff. He often uses PP <span style="color:red" data-ts="1495.745" data-end_ts="1495.965" title="1495.745" id=c_"1495.745">__but__</span> use synthesizers alongside that, that, that's, good. Those are, I mean, we've <span style="color:red" data-ts="1502.325" data-end_ts="1502.445" title="1502.325" id=c_"1502.325">__had__</span> sort of sitting down and really thinking about it, that that's two people who spring their mind. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That's, that's cool. That's an, especially the boards. I mean, you are right. They have been so influential that there's almost like entire genres of music that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1516.195" data-end_ts="1516.485" title="1516.195" id=c_"1516.195">__have__</span> showing up because of some of their, their influence. That's really, that's really poignant. Now, another thing that I want to ask you, and you kind of talked about it when you're talking about some of the ways that you met or interacted with people, is that you are part of, sort of like the group of electronic musicians that does performances all over the world. And particularly, I'm curious what you feel like is the difference between, the electronic music world in England or maybe in broader Europe and what you see when you come to America? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ian: </b>Well, there's a lot, there's a lot of, crossover <span style="color:red" data-ts="1558.495" data-end_ts="1558.845" title="1558.495" id=c_"1558.495">__costs__</span>. I, I find, I mean, let's take two musicians, obviously Robert Rich I've worked with, and Steve Roach. Let's stick with those two guys. Okay. I've, especially Steve Roche's, tracks and pieces that I've heard it, it has what I would call a wide screen kind of feel. The landscapes in the states are huge. You've got big landscapes, there's deserts, the, mountain ranges, it's all very big. I don't mean in terms of a bombastic sound, but you feel these big open spaces. And I think certainly Steve and Robert as well have captured that sound over here. The Berlin School doesn't really have that kind of feel. It's more of a spacey feel. So that, that's certainly one thing that I've, I've, I've noticed there's a much more of, of a, a cosmic, a cosmic spacey feel over here. Right. There's more of a landscape, kind of wide open space feel in the states. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1610.785" data-end_ts="1611.005" title="1610.785" id=c_"1610.785">__You__</span> know, whether that makes sense or not. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, I think it does. And actually <laugh>, I have, when you talk about it in cosmic terms, that actually reminds me of, one time when I was in Germany for the Frankfurt music mess <span style="color:red" data-ts="1626.085" data-end_ts="1626.285" title="1626.085" id=c_"1626.085">__up__</span>. I ended up in a hotel that had a TV and at late night I would turn on the TV because I, you know, jet lag would make it so I would be up all night. Yeah, I would, I would turn on the TV and there would be like a guy sitting in a chair expounding about something in German. So I didn't know what he was saying, but with like crazy, galaxies behind him. And then it would be a cricket, and then it would be, you know, electron microscope views. And it was like, I just thought, wow, whoever's doing this late <span style="color:red" data-ts="1662.165" data-end_ts="1662.365" title="1662.165" id=c_"1662.165">__light__</span> TV is tripping in some amazingly cosmic way. Right. <laugh>. And that's the kind, that's the kind of like visual and that's kind of a headspace that in fact doesn't seem to really exist here in the US as well. I mean, we have like screaming preachers for religious shows, but that's about the closest we have. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ian: </b>Yeah. Well, you know, the, the tv the state is, is a whole different, subject 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. It really is. So, if we talk about, some of your other work, and particularly your library work, I think library's work is something that a lot of people imagine. Well, first of all, I think a lot of people imagine they would be good at it, whether they would be or not. Right. Yeah. But I'm also, I'm also, wondering how, how do you frame your vision for music so that it works in library music? Because I think there are a lot of people that are, that think they'd be good, good at it. But I also think that there are probably some really difficult parts of doing it. And I'd <span style="color:red" data-ts="1729.205" data-end_ts="1729.285" title="1729.205" id=c_"1729.205">__kinda__</span> like to hear from you what you think are the difficult parts, but also how you make it so that you can take your musical voice and put it in a way that can be usable for, television show, television shows or commercials.

So a lot of the stuff I've done for <span style="color:red" data-ts="1798.205" data-end_ts="1798.365" title="1798.205" id=c_"1798.205">__the__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1798.365" data-end_ts="1798.565" title="1798.365" id=c_"1798.365">__Wolf__</span>, you know, some of the stuff could almost be on din. It's a little bit more tamed, it's a little bit more toned down. Not quite as scary or freaky, or not many, not so many sound effects. And it's mixed in a very kind of conservative way. But, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1813.425" data-end_ts="1813.645" title="1813.425" id=c_"1813.425">__and__</span> I don't think I'm your typical, live music composer. Right, right.

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That's interesting.

</p>

<p>
<b>Ian: </b>I kind of pitched them. It was a little, the little story was that I was working for <span style="color:red" data-ts="1870.045" data-end_ts="1870.245" title="1870.045" id=c_"1870.045">__aka__</span> this sampler company for a good few years. And I was doing, I think, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1874.845" data-end_ts="1875.045" title="1874.845" id=c_"1874.845">__what__</span>, 90, 0, 95 or so, I was doing a, a demonstration of the archive. And I was as, as I tended to do in those days, I just played my regular tracks, but on the archives. And then people kind of either liked it or didn't, it would bother the samplers. And was one guy in the audience who afterwards came up to me and said, I really liked what you heard, what, what you played there. Have you never considered your music being used on TV or film? And I'm like, yeah, of course I have. But you know, how do you get, how do you get started? He says, oh, I, I do a lot of work with the Wolf. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ian: </b>I mean, I've since found out this guy, Andy Quinn is their biggest <span style="color:red" data-ts="1907.705" data-end_ts="1907.925" title="1907.705" id=c_"1907.705">__air__</span> writer. He's written literally hundreds, if not thousands of tracks for them. And he literally put me in touch with the main guy <span style="color:red" data-ts="1913.525" data-end_ts="1913.725" title="1913.525" id=c_"1913.525">__De__</span> Wolf, and said, why don't you send off an, an album? So there was an album before <span style="color:red" data-ts="1918.325" data-end_ts="1918.445" title="1918.325" id=c_"1918.325">__d__</span> this was called, the Deep. And I sent off a copy of The Deep, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1922.245" data-end_ts="1922.405" title="1922.245" id=c_"1922.245">__because__</span> I thought it was quite a, a filmic kind of, a cd. Right. And I got a phone call back from this guy. And, initially it was like, the music very interesting, but we don't have any work for you at this point in time. And of course, when you hear that kind of thing, you kind of assume, well, that's it kind of 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1939.205" data-end_ts="1939.285" title="1939.205" id=c_"1939.205">__<crosstalk>__</span>. Right. Never gonna hear from him again. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ian: </b>Exactly. Except six months down the line, I got a phone call one night and, Warren <span style="color:red" data-ts="1946.065" data-end_ts="1946.485" title="1946.065" id=c_"1946.065">__Dowell__</span> said to me, yeah, we've got <span style="color:red" data-ts="1949.125" data-end_ts="1949.285" title="1949.125" id=c_"1949.125">__some__</span> a project coming up.

And then I've been doing work for them since 1996, so I, again, I'll lose track, but it's between 15 and 20 albums worth of stuff I've done for, for, for them now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Wow. Well, okay, now I can say that I've actually met somebody who got a callback <laugh>. I'm not sure I'd ever met anyone before. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ian: </b>No, it was amazing. And coincidentally, I'd send them an album called <span style="color:red" data-ts="1978.685" data-end_ts="1978.845" title="1978.685" id=c_"1978.685">__The__</span> Deep, which is all about the Sea, of course. Right. And the second album I did for them was all about the Sea. So that was quite a funny little coincidence as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's hilarious. It, it sounds to me also like your experience with doing library music is not typical. So it's not like you could say Here, kids go do like I do and you'll get, you'll be able to do library work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ian: </b>No, I, I've got this phrase. I think I'm the only professional <span style="color:red" data-ts="2002.545" data-end_ts="2002.765" title="2002.545" id=c_"2002.545">__in__</span> body in the world. <laugh>. I don't think there's anyone. Yeah. I don't think there's anyone who has followed my path. It's such a convoluted path. It's a path that I've got over the years by, you know, some of, some of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2017.205" data-end_ts="2017.285" title="2017.205" id=c_"2017.205">__it__</span> by design, some of it not by design, but it's a unique path that I've taken. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2021.385" data-end_ts="2021.605" title="2021.385" id=c_"2021.385">__And__</span> so it's difficult sometimes I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2022.765" data-end_ts="2022.925" title="2022.765" id=c_"2022.765">__can__</span> certainly give people advice, but it's doesn't mean they're gonna be able to follow the path that I took. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, but now I am gonna ask you to give advice because if you would run across a 20 year old version of yourself, what do you think you would tell that person? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ian: </b>Do something else? <laugh>? Well, no, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2043.145" data-end_ts="2043.365" title="2043.145" id=c_"2043.145">__no__</span>. Jo jogging apart to make an income from what I'm doing now is getting harder and harder and harder. We all know what's happening with CD sales, with the downloads, which is downloads are going up, but they're not really covering the drop in CD sales. It's becoming a lot harder to sell stuff. When I first started out, there was only a handful of people in the UK doing the kind of style <span style="color:red" data-ts="2065.145" data-end_ts="2065.365" title="2065.145" id=c_"2065.145">__of__</span> music that I do now. There's probably hundreds, if not thousands, thousands of people. And that's just in the uk. You go on iTunes, there's millions and millions and millions of tracks. How can <span style="color:red" data-ts="2075.765" data-end_ts="2075.885" title="2075.765" id=c_"2075.765">__a__</span> how can a new musician stand out from the crowd? It's very, very hard. So I would say if you want to do it, 'cause you're passionate about it, you're creative, do it for yourself primarily. Always do it an art form. Be it, music making or whatever. Do it for yourself. If along the line, opportunities come along where you can make an income, that's a bonus. But don't do it the other way around. Or you could be <span style="color:red" data-ts="2100.525" data-end_ts="2100.765" title="2100.525" id=c_"2100.525">__solely__</span> disappointed. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. That's really good, really good advice. Now, one more thing, I, you've talked about how the music industry is changing so radically and stuff. One of the big changes is now the new prevalence of online streaming services, like, like Spotify and now 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ian: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2124.005" data-end_ts="2124.565" title="2124.005" id=c_"2124.005">__<inaudible>__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Yep. All of these, all of these things now are kind of really replacing the, the cd, but they don't really replace the cd. And to me, the CD never even replaced the album very much because the lack of liner notes and stuff was pretty, was pretty rough. But it does seem like this streaming, like streaming music is the future. How do you see that affecting what you do and how do you see that affecting sort of the quality of, or the, the kind of people that get into doing music kind of professionally? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ian: </b>It's difficult to say it's a little early. The Apple, music could have a huge impact. 'cause obviously iTunes, if you can get all you want for $10 <span style="color:red" data-ts="2170.825" data-end_ts="2171.045" title="2170.825" id=c_"2170.825">__or__</span> 10 pound a month, why would you necessarily buy download? And I get sales reports through from the distributor who deals with iTunes. For me it's, I think I've only had one month's worth of the Apple music streaming. So I don't know whether it's gonna significantly reduce ordinary digital sales. Time will tell with that. But physical stuff's a bit more interesting. The vinyl album in some ways is coming back. I don't think it's ever gonna get back to being mainstream. But same with cd. A lot of people like to have a physical thing, a product that they can look at, they can touch, they can put on the shelves, they can collect. And I think <span style="color:red" data-ts="2207.925" data-end_ts="2208.245" title="2207.925" id=c_"2207.925">__they'll__</span> always be, those kind of people. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ian: </b>They <span style="color:red" data-ts="2211.005" data-end_ts="2211.165" title="2211.005" id=c_"2211.005">__low__</span> speed collectors there who want <span style="color:red" data-ts="2212.745" data-end_ts="2212.965" title="2212.745" id=c_"2212.745">__the__</span> physical object. But I think it's gonna become increasingly niche. So I think the CD will probably end up a little bit like the vinyl album is now, it'd be quite like a niche collector thing. It won't go away, but it'll become an increasingly smaller amount of the overall total sales. Whether streaming can overcome that or not, I don't know. It might just be another nail in the coffin of how easy it is or not, as the case may be to make a living from actually putting stuff out. What seems to be happening <span style="color:red" data-ts="2245.725" data-end_ts="2245.845" title="2245.725" id=c_"2245.725">__with__</span> a lot of musicians, not necessarily in the electronic vein or something in the mainstream, is to do concerts. What you can't do in the virtual world is to share an experience with other people in the same way you can actually share it in a concert hall or a festival or a, on a big stage. Those shared events <span style="color:red" data-ts="2266.145" data-end_ts="2266.365" title="2266.145" id=c_"2266.145">__or__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2267.005" data-end_ts="2267.125" title="2267.005" id=c_"2267.005">__a__</span> unique experiences. And I think a lot of people are putting the money into spending things like, which are unique experience. So I think it will encourage people to play live and I think that's a good thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, that's, that's a great point and a great thought. Okay. So before I let you go, I said I wasn't gonna talk about gear, but I have to throw a gear question at you. <laugh> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2291.045" data-end_ts="2291.085" title="2291.045" id=c_"2291.045">__of__</span> all the stuff that, of all the stuff that you use or you have used, what's your favorite instrument 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ian: </b>That's difficult? I'll give you two. Can I have two? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ian: </b>The first one I mentioned before is the V CS three. It was the thing that I learned to play on anybody who didn't know what AVCS three, it's that weird lha looking synthesizer with a little, little pinboard. And it was much used by the Air onic workshop in the uk. A lot of the early <span style="color:red" data-ts="2320.645" data-end_ts="2320.965" title="2320.645" id=c_"2320.645">__Doctor__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2321.135" data-end_ts="2321.485" title="2321.135" id=c_"2321.135">__Whoof__</span> had it on, and it's a UK British synthesizer. It's not well known. And nothing, nothing sounds like it. It's really not very well made, but it's got something unique about it. And it's what I learned to play on. And I, I, I own one now and it, it's gonna be the last thing out of the door because it's such a weird and wonderful, and in some ways it really is a synthesizer. You can't, a lawyer can, you can kind of play tunes on it. It's not really what it's designed for. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ian: </b>The majority <span style="color:red" data-ts="2349.905" data-end_ts="2350.125" title="2349.905" id=c_"2349.905">__of__</span> synthesizers are, are really an organ with lots of presets. Right. They have a keyboard and you play these, you play string sounds and piano sounds and all those sort of things. That's to me is not what a synthesizer <span style="color:red" data-ts="2360.085" data-end_ts="2360.245" title="2360.085" id=c_"2360.085">__is__</span> about. Synthesizers should produce sounds that you just never heard, heard before. My second choice is to do with expression. When you're playing a lot of synthesizers, a lot of people still don't think electronic music is particularly expressive. I have a keyboard made by a uk modular synthesizer company, which is based on the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2379.585" data-end_ts="2379.805" title="2379.585" id=c_"2379.585">__on__</span>, Martin, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2380.945" data-end_ts="2381.165" title="2380.945" id=c_"2380.945">__or__</span> which is a French keyboard, which was came out when the, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2386.225" data-end_ts="2386.445" title="2386.225" id=c_"2386.225">__air__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2386.805" data-end_ts="2387.045" title="2386.805" id=c_"2386.805">__emman__</span> came out. Unlike the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2388.445" data-end_ts="2388.565" title="2388.445" id=c_"2388.445">__film__</span>, which is <span style="color:red" data-ts="2389.365" data-end_ts="2389.485" title="2389.365" id=c_"2389.365">__an__</span> instrument you don't actually physically touch, it's a keyboard, but you've got a wire out with a ring running along the front of the keys. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ian: </b>And you, you slide that up and down and that plays the pitch. You've also got a rocker pedal on your left hand side, which controls how loud the sound is. It can also control the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2404.305" data-end_ts="2404.525" title="2404.305" id=c_"2404.305">__tom__</span> of the sound. If you don't press it down, there's no sound. What this means, you've got total articulation of the sound. It's not like pressing a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2411.885" data-end_ts="2412.045" title="2411.885" id=c_"2411.885">__key__</span> on <span style="color:red" data-ts="2412.205" data-end_ts="2412.325" title="2412.205" id=c_"2412.205">__a__</span>, on a regular synthesizer. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="2414.565" data-end_ts="2414.725" title="2414.565" id=c_"2414.565">__the__</span> the envelope kind of, it, it fires off and the the sound will trigger. You have to make the sound get louder and quieter. This modular synthesizer company <span style="color:red" data-ts="2422.985" data-end_ts="2423.205" title="2422.985" id=c_"2422.985">__has__</span> done a keyboard called the French Connection, which mimics the on <span style="color:red" data-ts="2426.985" data-end_ts="2427.405" title="2426.985" id=c_"2426.985">__mortal__</span> keyboard. Right. I've used it a lot. Most anybody who's got the album slide of mine, that's why it's called Slide, that's when I first got this, keyboard. Ah, okay. And I use it on some of my other collaboration. It's just, it's this keyboard sound <span style="color:red" data-ts="2439.285" data-end_ts="2439.565" title="2439.285" id=c_"2439.285">__kind__</span> of whales. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2440.045" data-end_ts="2440.325" title="2440.045" id=c_"2440.045">__It's__</span>, it's almost a little bit like Robert Richard's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2442.275" data-end_ts="2442.565" title="2442.275" id=c_"2442.275">__GLIs__</span> guitar sound, but it's from a synthesizer and it's simply the most expressive instrument I've ever played. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that's really interesting that you're, you're using these like, I mean it really ties you to the physical, your physical movement. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ian: </b>Yes. If I don't <span style="color:red" data-ts="2459.165" data-end_ts="2459.365" title="2459.165" id=c_"2459.165">__pro__</span>, if I don't press the rock switch, nothing happens. There's no sound. If you wanna do vibrato, you don't use an L four for vibrato. You physically waggle the ring slightly up and back and forwards. If you wanna slow vibrato, you'll regulate a bit slower <laugh> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2473.085" data-end_ts="2473.125" title="2473.085" id=c_"2473.085">__if__</span> you wanna fast vibrato a bit faster. So it's much more like playing a violin. You've got total control of the expression. I can change the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2480.805" data-end_ts="2480.965" title="2480.805" id=c_"2480.805">__tone__</span> of the sound, the volume of the sound, the pitch, the sound, the vibrato, all the things that regular acoustic instruments can do, you can do on this. And as far as I'm aware, it's pretty unique in terms of a controller for a synthesizer. I tend to use the modular synthesizer. And there's not that many people got this. I don't, but I don't know of another musician who's got this instrument, although there must be a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2504.485" data-end_ts="2504.605" title="2504.485" id=c_"2504.485">__few__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2504.605" data-end_ts="2504.805" title="2504.605" id=c_"2504.605">__out__</span> there. And it gives me a little bit of an edge. It gives me quite a unique sound and it's, I love it. So those are my two choices. That's fantastic. Very different, reasons.

<b>Darwin: </b>And there you have it. Wasn't that a great interview? You like how I snuck in a little gear talk at the end just to, just to do it. Can't help it. Anyway, I wanted to thank you very much for your continued listenership. Next week is episode number 100. Never thought I'd get there. This weekend is also when the funding of the Kickstarter campaign is complete. I want to thank first of all, in generic terms, everybody that was involved in spreading the word as well as, supporting the podcast through that Kickstarter. Next week, we're going to start announcing the contributors that were, so helpful in making that happen and will be so helpful in getting me set up with a great mobile recording system. So I wanna thank you all again very much with that, have a great week. Bye.
