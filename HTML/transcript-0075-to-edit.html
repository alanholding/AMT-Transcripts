<b>Darwin: </b>All right, and welcome to podcast number 75. Thanks for tuning in. This week I'm going to be talking to my friend Dave Fidel. Now, I wanted to provide an intro just to let you know why I picked Dave. First of all, it's because he's an amazing artist, and I'm really glad to give him a little bit of the spotlight and also to find out about what kind of background turns you into a guy like him. But, it's also time sensitive. He does the development of events and festivals and stuff, and he's been working with the University of Colorado in Denver, for this performing arts week. And on Thursday, April 16th, he has invited me to work with Janet Federer, an amazing guitarist, in a wonderful place called Emanuel Gallery, on the campus of U C D. So if you happen to be somewhere in the Denver area, I'll be playing from roughly 7 45 <span style="color:red" data-ts="62.76" data-end_ts="63.04" title="62.76" id=c_"62.76">__till__</span> 8 45. Although the fun commences at six o'clock. Other performers, there's interaction with students. We've got students that are doing visuals. So I hope that if you have an opportunity, you'll stop by and take a listen. Take a watch and touch base with me if you come in. Okay. Other than that, here's my chat with Dave. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright. This week we are meeting with a friend of mine. David Fidel is somebody that I actually first met, actually I first met him when I moved into town. I met him around, around the scene a little bit. But I mostly first met him when I started interacting with the University of Denver. He was, at the time, <span style="color:red" data-ts="106.26" data-end_ts="106.48" title="106.26" id=c_"106.26">__an__</span> a student, as we like to call him adult learner. And then as I moved into my adult learner phase, he and I were kind of going to school at the same time, got to do a couple of little projects together. Then he went off to his professional career and he's been doing some really cool stuff. We'll let him kind of talk about those things, but I hope he's gonna talk about his festivals. I think he will. But with that we'll say hello to Dave. Hi, Dave, how are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>David Fodel: </b>Hey, Darwin I'm doing great, man. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thanks so much for taking the time outta your schedule to being able to do this. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>It's, it's a pleasure, thrilled to be able to, be talking to you and to, be part of the podcast series. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I'm actually really thrilled to, to be talking to you. I mean, you are one of the most multi of multimedia artists that I know, and so I'm, I'm really anxious to get, to learn more about some of your background stuff. But let's kick this off by kind of introducing the things that you do to people. So what, what are sort of the projects that you identify yourself with? 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>You know, that has become an increasingly difficult question for me to answer. <laugh>. I, I, I guess primarily, you know, I, I say that I'm a electronic media artist, and, and that's sort of the big blanket thing, you know, depending on who I'm talking to, I'll say, you know, if, if they just sort of glaze over and don't know what that is, I will say, you know, I use, I use video and sound, and sometimes it's in a performative setting. Sometimes it's an installation, sometimes kind of a hybrid between the two, where I am installing a work in a particular location, with the intent of then performing a version of the same work so that it kind of has a performative, component to it. But yet it is also designed to be kind of an audio visual immersive experience to some degree or another. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>I like to characterize the work as kind of taking elements of the invisible world and making them visible or visible also to our ears, perhaps, but it's not always the same. So that's what I said. It's, it's difficult sometimes to, to really characterize the work. I, I like to work with electronics in the form of sound, in the form of visuals, physical computing in terms of like lately really been sort of spreading my sculpture wings, building components, doing much more kind of installation based work where there are real physical elements that are present in the space as opposed to just sort of screen or projection based stuff. So yeah, I'm kind of all over the map at this point. I'm really sort of searching for my middle aged, <laugh> identity here. <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. That's funny. Well, one of the things I'll say, so where, where we've been interacting with just recently is in preparation for this, gathering of some sort, I don't know, what do you call these things? It's, it's sort of like an event, right? I guess as we could call it an event. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But as part of that, I'm working with a group of your students, and I was, the more I found out about these students, and especially then when I met 'em, I was kind of blown away with what you're doing there. You're actually working with a group of sculpture students working with them to do media art, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Yeah. And what we've done, so this is at the University of Colorado, Denver, I have been working with, Ian <span style="color:red" data-ts="336.95" data-end_ts="337.24" title="336.95" id=c_"336.95">__Kare__</span> there, who is the, the department head in the sculpture department. And they've actually over the years, been trying to sort of build this thing that they, they're calling transmedia sculpture. I think it's their attempt to sort of bridge into the new, new media program kind of world. It's, it's a small program. So they, there are some of the schools that have been doing this kind of electronic media stuff for a long time, and they have like departments for film and departments for animation. Oh, sure. Right. You know, they got it's, but for, for this program, <span style="color:red" data-ts="366.39" data-end_ts="366.68" title="366.39" id=c_"366.39">__they__</span>, the, it, it has somehow kind of gotten attached to the sculpture department. It, it, it's a way of trying to, work with this media in a way that it really takes advantage of the spatial component of it. Sometimes it's site specific, sometimes it's working with objects that, incorporate electronics or sound or video, you know, so it's kind of is is building from that. And the, this particular class that <span style="color:red" data-ts="396.2" data-end_ts="396.32" title="396.2" id=c_"396.2">__the__</span>, that we're doing this, you know, this thing that you mentioned is, is called electronic performance. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Well, one of the things that I certainly immediately caught onto was that working with, when you're working with sculptors, there's, there's no sense that they wanna work inside the box, right? They're for them, they'll do stuff inside the box, but if it also means like hanging some stuff off the ceiling, that's their game for that too. Need to make a bracket. Well, we'll just go and make a bracket. And it's so much different from working with kind of the traditional media artists who sort of like, you know, work in some Adobe product and make things that live in a rectangular frame. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Yeah. And I think for me, that's what has been most exciting because, I mean, I don't have a traditional sculpture background, however, you know, as you mentioned, you know, I'm, I'm this, what did you call it? The, the late life learner or <span style="color:red" data-ts="456.88" data-end_ts="457" title="456.88" id=c_"456.88">__what__</span>? Oh yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The adult learner. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>The adult learner, yeah. Yeah, yeah. So I have, through my life, been a very diversely employed kind of guy. So <laugh>, you know, I've built a lot of things. And, so, you know, I'm fairly handy, but I don't have that kind of like real traditional sculpture background and being thrust into a very traditional sculpture program. This is a sculpture program. They got wood shop, metal shop, they do iron casting, welding, the whole thing. You know, it was a little bit intimidating to be walking into a classroom where it's kind of like some of the students know more about the lab we're working in than I do. But it has been super cool to be able to, as you said, to be able to think about things in ways that aren't locked into this, this sort of computer based framework. The <span style="color:red" data-ts="509.4" data-end_ts="509.56" title="509.4" id=c_"509.4">__comp__</span>, in fact, the computer for them is sort of, you know, just as I described how the sculpture lab is for me, for some of the students, they're just kind of like, oh, God, I hate the computer <laugh>. And, and, you know, so then, so then I feel like, oh, okay, cool. So now, now we have this little dialogue going where, you know, we're, we're actually sharing some things. They feel like they have a level of expertise that they're bringing to the table. And, and I have, you know, this other side of that. And so the dialogue becomes almost that of, you know, colleagues of, of equals of, you know, artists working to together collaboratively. And, I just, I just totally love that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, that's, yeah, you really must dig that. That's great. So one of the things I like to, ask people when I talk to them is to tell me about their background and how they got to be the artist that they are in. Over the years that I've known you, you've revealed very little about your past. It's, it's come out in very tiny little tidbits here and there. And so I'm actually really curious to hear how you got to be the Dave that I know. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Yeah. Well, I'm not really sure who the Dave is that, you know, <laugh>, but, but, yeah. Well, we could go way back. Okay. So I really have no, you know, before I went to DU to get my M F A I, I had absolutely no formal art training at all. Like, I didn't even take a high school art class. I thought, I thought people that took art classes in high school were, it was just because they were bad at math. Right. You know, so my, my background really is, kind of a college dropout, punk rock kid from southeast Baltimore who in the early eighties was into a lot of noise and really sort of underground electronics. You know, even the punk thing I thought was too, like, too pop or something. Right, right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="639.04" data-end_ts="639.36" title="639.04" id=c_"639.04">__Comes__</span> into like Throbbing Gristle and Monte Caza and survival research labs and, and that kind of whole scene, the industrial stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>You know, that, that was real interesting to me. And I, I was gravitating towards the, the sort of downtown Baltimore art music scene. You know, it just so happens there is a very good art school in Baltimore, the Maryland Institute of, college of Art. And I started hanging out with all those kinds of people and realizing that like, oh, like this is art. This is, this isn't just like weird stuff that only comes out of my head. There's like, this is like a whole world, you know? So, I got immersed in that scene. I was doing sound for a lot of bands. I was doing my own experimentation with, you know, tape looping and, sort of no input sound with old tape decks and plugging them into themselves and getting all sorts of horrific rich, amazing, wonderful noise out of it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>And, and doing a little bit of performance work there, kind of got my first exposure to being an organizer. I put together a lot of events, at a place called Our House in Baltimore, in, I don't know, I guess it was around 1985, and basically figured out how to, how to be that guy that could make something happen, pull together a lot of people, somehow avoid being arrested and <laugh> and make a little bit of rent money, you know? So, and from there, you know, I I, I met the woman who is now my wife Stacy b in that whole scene. And we started doing live audio visual stuff together right in that same timeframe as part of the sort of our house parties. We were doing, hand painted <span style="color:red" data-ts="756.59" data-end_ts="756.88" title="756.59" id=c_"756.59">__code__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="756.88" data-end_ts="757.16" title="756.88" id=c_"756.88">__lift__</span> slides with a couple of slide projectors, and we didn't have a dissolved unit, so we just took pieces of cardboard and would move them in front of the lenses to get the, the images to dissolve over one another. And, you know, it was kind of a, a ghetto version of like Joshua Light Show or whatever. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What, what time, what was the timeframe of this? What year years was this that you started doing this? Your, your ghetto tech av? 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>This was probably 85, 86. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Yeah. And then shortly thereafter, we, we moved out to, to Boulder. We, we got pregnant and, you know, I was living in a warehouse, and I'm not sure, you know, that that was really the best place to raise children, so, right. So we, we bought a Volkswagen bus and we headed out across the country and somehow landed in Boulder. And once we hit Boulder, we, you know, I, I kind of was just looking for like, what's going on here? How do, how do I, how do I keep being this guy? You know, I, I like to connect with people. I like sort of, making things happen. And, so I, I kind of fell in with a bunch of people here. And, we decided to start a newspaper. So we started this underground arts newspaper called Texture Magazine, and it served as a, a wonderful way to really connect with the community as well as sort of a, a locust for operations and a way to sort of, gel different projects around that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>So we started, a bunch of people that were involved with the newspaper we're also involved with K G N U Radio, which is, I'm sure you're familiar with, is, you know, incredible community resource. You know, one of the, one of the top sort of public radio community radio stations in the country, I would guess. And, so we were doing some little events with them, and, you know, there was music and kind of craziness and sort of, sort of like happenings in a way. And so that was sort of the early Boulder excursions into similar stuff. We, kind of got involved in the, the early rave scene in Boulder, and then we started an internet radio station. We were broadcasting all electronic music that was called Radio Valve. That was, <span style="color:red" data-ts="905.79" data-end_ts="906.08" title="905.79" id=c_"905.79">__that__</span>, that turned, that was 97 or 98 that we started that we were one of the early ra internet radio broadcasters. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>And, you know, again, that sort of connected me into a, an even broader network of people. We started throwing events associated with that, you know, and, and then we, we did not, we did not manage to become the, the billionaires <laugh> hoped from our, from our internet venture. Then I sort of dropped out for a little bit and kind of went into corporate reality and worked the corporate thing. As you know, I, I had gained a lot of skills in electronic media production, just self-taught a lot of electronic pre-press and video editing. And when the web thing hit, I, I started doing, you know, kind of translating people's brochures from print to the web and, doing <span style="color:red" data-ts="962.2" data-end_ts="962.48" title="962.2" id=c_"962.2">__that__</span>, all that kind of stuff. And ended up becoming a, a, a traveling consultant for a database publishing software company. And, did that for a number of years, flying all over the place. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>And so at that point, my, my kind of my artistic thing was, was sort of sitting dormant more or less, had done some things with, with Brian Kane, who you may know, he's, he's one of the founding members of Emergency Broadcast Network. Oh, yeah. And, he and I, and another guy, E 23, Brian Erford, who's a guy that was also part of the radio station, we did sort of a laptop touring thing in 99, 2003, laptops, two, two of us, we, we had like, I don't know, Ableton version one or something. Right. And we had that linked together. We were just doing crazy synchronized beats, and, and Brian Kane was doing jitter <span style="color:red" data-ts="1023.72" data-end_ts="1023.88" title="1023.72" id=c_"1023.72">__based__</span> video stuff, real time, crazy cutup stuff. We, we did that for a while. And, and then at a certain point, I just kinda, I, I, I couldn't deal with the corporate thing anymore. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>And so I told my wife, I think I wanna go back to school, and I think I want to teach, I wanna try and get like my M F A and get a teaching gig. And she's a high school art teacher, and she gets summers off. And so I thought, Hey, this, this, this is the thing. This is what we should do. We'll, you know, we'll both have teaching jobs. We'll, we'll both have summers off. It'll be awesome. And so that, that's, that's essentially where I met you is when I went back to right to du to, to get the M F A. And, since then, you know, that that tenure track job has not materialized <laugh> <laugh>, but, but things are good. Anyway, that's sort of the background. I think that's how I kind of ended up where I am right now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's kinda interesting because you're actually tracking a lot of the things that, as we look back, are the groundwork that led us to where we are, you know, kind of the, the punk scene as it's split into all these little, little cells of, you know, some of it being power pop, but the other half of it being, you know, drills on a guitar pickup. Right. That's, that's an a real influential thing for where we're at with a lot of our experimentalism now. Your involvement in the ra rave scene, kind of, I, I really remember that timeframe where just trying to find a way to put everything we could get our hands on, on the net and sharing it with all of these friends that we first met on the net and all that kind of stuff was such, was so vital and such, such an amazing thing. But I wanna focus <span style="color:red" data-ts="1137.18" data-end_ts="1137.4" title="1137.18" id=c_"1137.18">__on__</span>, on something specific, which is this, when you moved here and you started this magazine, this, this texture magazine. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I didn't know that you were involved in that. And, that was, that was one of those things that was like, you know, it, it was a ton of cred thing. And so you said that it was, it opened a lot of doors for you. What, in what way, in what way did you need to do that in order to get in, get involved in the scene? I mean, was how hard is it to just like, move into a city and just say, all right, I'm here, let's rock. You know, I, I guess, especially if you're gonna try and do events, I mean, for me, I show up in a place, but it's sort of like, I don't speak to humans very often. I mostly just, you know, type things via email or whatever. So I not, I tend to not, feel like I have to meet a bunch of people. But especially if you're planning on doing events or you're getting involved with collaborative performance and stuff, you need to find people, you need to find your people. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Right. Yeah. Well, I think, you know, in, in some ways, there, there was something of a void, and I, I don't know if it was just sort of timing or, or what, but, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1222.76" data-end_ts="1223" title="1222.76" id=c_"1222.76">__that__</span> that was also the time where like the whole self-publishing and the, the, the zine kind of phenomena was, was really gelling. And, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1232.52" data-end_ts="1232.72" title="1232.52" id=c_"1232.52">__this__</span>, this was when, when we started the magazine, this, it was probably, let's see, we moved to Boulder in 87, so that was, that was probably 88. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>You know, so self-publishing was pretty, pretty solid, solidly a, a thing at that point. And, you know, Boulder, there was a, a pretty cool scene, you know, like, penny Lane, coffee House, and a lot of, you know, like, people just constantly coming through, you know? Right. And Boulder was kind of a different place then. And so, you know, I, so the first thing I did was I went to the university to CU Boulder, and I went to their, they, they had a, a video art class, and I went to the instructor was, Janice Tanaka. I just said, I'm just gonna take your class. I'm not gonna pay for it. I just, I just wanna <laugh>, I just wanna sit in on the class and just see what's going on and see, you know, I, I've done a lot of gorilla video kind of stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>And, and, and I had, you know, like in Baltimore, that was like, I was doing video stuff. It was really difficult to get ahold of, like porta packs and stuff, but I somehow had managed to do that. Like, actually, it was the same sort of deal. I went to U N B C and I, I just took the class without paying for it <laugh>. And, I was just like, I'm gonna do this. And I, I don't know, people just <span style="color:red" data-ts="1312.6" data-end_ts="1312.8" title="1312.6" id=c_"1312.6">__didn't__</span>, they didn't turn me away. Maybe they just liked <laugh>, that, that I was ballsy enough to show up and just say, I'm gonna do this. But anyway, so when I got into that class and I started just kind of meeting some people in the class, you know, I, I just sort of followed the, followed the cool or whatever, you know, like that that person looks like they're connected to some scene, you know, they're like, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1336" data-end_ts="1336.24" title="1336" id=c_"1336">__they__</span>, he, he said something like, he's in a band, so I'm gonna say, well, you know, what band is that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>And where, you know, where do you guys play? Oh, okay. You play here. So you show up. Just kind of insinuate myself into the scene, and it became apparent that people, you know, if in a small town like Boulder, like you get these little factions, and like I said, the timing is such that like, you can have these very fertile periods where everyone is collaborating and talking to one another, and then it sort of deteriorates into Factionism, and everybody is like pissed off at each other. <laugh>. Right. And I think that I showed up at a time where it was kind of like everybody was sort of, they had already been pissed off at each other, and now it was sort of like, well, you know, now what's gonna happen? Like, we're all, now we're just bored because like, you know, we don't even have the energy to be pissed off at each other anymore, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>So I just kinda showed up and said, and people were just like, you know, yeah. There's nothing really going on in, in, in Boulder now, you know? And I was like, well, let's just make something happen then. And we just, we just did. I think that they were, excited about this new guy. You know, I, I'm very, I, I'll just do everything. So, so I did, I just said, we're gonna put on an event, and I just like did everything. I made the flyers, I talked to everybody, I booked people, we, you know, went and talked to the venues and just basically working constantly to make things happen. And then you just prove it, you know? Right. There it is. It happened. Like, you know, and then there's your cred kind of, you know, people were like, wow, you know, he's not just 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Bullshit, it's not just blowing smoke. Right. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's interesting though that you talk about, you know, first of all, the timing of it, and yeah, there's, there's this funny, you really actually identified something which is really critical for like local art scenes, which is the way that they come together and there's a burst of energy, and then all of a sudden one person made a little bit more money on something, or one person got mentioned in a, in a national magazine, but nobody else did, or something like that. Next thing, you know, everyone's like, ah, they're a sellout, or, or, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1469.58" data-end_ts="1469.8" title="1469.58" id=c_"1469.58">__ah__</span>, that guy's such an asshole. Right? And the the end result is, yeah, everybody, everybody splits and it's like groups of, you know, there's one scene for every two people at that point, <laugh>. And so if you can be the guy that kind of drops in and says, yeah, okay, y'all can have that thing, but let's also do this thing altogether, that's, that's a powerful time to drop into a scene. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Yeah. And it seemed like that was maybe what it was, you know? I don't, like I said, I, I did, you know, I put a lot of effort in, but it, but, but I, you know, I don't know that there was anything particularly special about what I was doing, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, one of the things I've seen in watching you pull things like this together is, first of all, you have a really good way of making things, kind of suggesting a direction or an idea without anyone feeling like that was your idea that they're going to develop. Right? Instead, it's like, yeah, I have this idea too, and it's just like, what you said, but now here's my idea. You know, somehow you, you like really have a, you set up an open path for people to sort of bring their thing, and even if you make suggestions, it still remains their thing somehow, which is cool. That's, a lot of people can't do that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Well, that, that feels really great to actually hear you say that because, it's not something I consciously do. I just, or, or, or maybe it's, maybe it's something that has sort of developed over the many years sort of subconsciously or something, because I, I genuinely want people to do what they're into, you know, like, and I want to genuinely help facilitate that because at the end of the day, it's like, we're all here at this event, and we've all worked towards this, and I don't wanna put a bunch of effort into something that feels 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Not excellent, 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Not excellent, and not genuine, and, you know what I mean? So, so it's kind of like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1593.82" data-end_ts="1594.04" title="1593.82" id=c_"1593.82">__you__</span>, you want to push it the way that you want it to go, but you also know that like, if you make it just about you, then nobody's gonna show up, you know, <laugh>. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, the other thing that I, I would say that you, you are really good at in, in the development of these things is you are a catalyst for, a catalyst against inertia, right? So I've seen a lot of situations where there have been people that are, you know, everyone will be sitting around in chairs going, yeah, I'd like to do something. And, you know, someone else <span style="color:red" data-ts="1627.28" data-end_ts="1627.48" title="1627.28" id=c_"1627.28">__will__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1627.48" data-end_ts="1627.56" title="1627.48" id=c_"1627.48">__be__</span> like, yeah, I'd like to do something too. You're the guy who stands up and says, okay, let's do it. What's the date? Where are we gonna do it? Right. Who else should we get involved? And then, you know, a lot of times I am with you, I'm also kind of involved in that second wave thing, so everyone's like, oh, well, should we get involved? And someone will throw, throw names out, and you're the guy who gets on the phone and says, Hey, we're gonna do this thing. You want to do this thing? And I'll be like, yeah, I'll do that thing. That sounds great. Yeah. <laugh>, you know, that seems to be something that really has to come from a lot of experience of doing this stuff. I mean, just to feel like, just to kind of know intrinsically there are gonna be enough people that are into this that if I just say, let's do it, a bunch of people want to do it. I guess 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>I, you know, I, I think so. I think, I think at this point, and, and I guess, I guess this would sort of be a nice way to, to sort of dovetail into like the, the media live Right Festival, there was always this for me <span style="color:red" data-ts="1698.23" data-end_ts="1698.52" title="1698.23" id=c_"1698.23">__that__</span> this confidence in what I was curating that I just knew like, this, this is the shit <laugh>, right? This, this is important work, and we, we have to, we have to show this. And I just never felt any sort of hesitation with, with essentially any, any of the people that I invited. And in talking with everybody that I invited, it just felt like I was almost just like talking to friends, you know, like, Hey, we're doing this thing. Love to have you, you know, what do you think? You know, like if you look back at my email, <laugh> chains, you know, I, I, I sometimes would look at how the museum would craft their introduction email, and it's very formal and lengthy, and I'm just like, Hey, love your stuff doing this festival in November. Are you in <laugh>? That kind of, and there's just like three lines. And people were like, oh, sounds really cool. You know, like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1763.03" data-end_ts="1763.32" title="1763.03" id=c_"1763.03">__what__</span>, you know, what are the details? Or, yeah, I'm free, or whatever it is. You know, and it's just very conversational and it just, maybe, maybe there's part of that that people respond positively to that's just like, oh, this is, like, this is a guy that kind of gets it. Like he's not, you know, he's not like some administrator. He's like, one of us sort of thing. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I think that that's actually a really big part of it. There's not a sense you're an administrator trying to fill a, a invitee card, right? Right. Because I feel like a lot of times shows are done that way. It's sort of like, all right, well if we have these three names on the invitation that we're going get, you know, the 15% response rate that's gonna translate into this much money. I, my sense when you're doing stuff is you're like, I'm really excited to get these people in. And it, and it really gets communicated even through these minimalist emails, this thing like, let's go love your work. I'm doing this thing, let's rock. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Yeah. I, I think that that has to be part of it. And, and, you know, and maybe, maybe there is some of that that comes from having done this for a long time. It's like, Hey, man, we don't, we don't have a lot of time to be messing around here, you know, like, <laugh>, you're in or you're not, you know, like let you know when we're moving forward and, and there's a sense of not necessarily like, we're rushing, but there's a, a sense of like, you know, confident, sort of positive urgency that like, doing this thing. And, I want you to be part of it. And, and I, I would, I would like to think that at this point people can trust that what I'm trying to do, like that I'm gonna take care of the artists. Right. And that has been a definite focus of mine. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>At least, you know, probably the past five years is like, and certainly through Media live, like we, we take care of the artists. We, we pay them, we, we put 'em up in a nice place. You know, we, we try to create an environment where the artists have some time to be together. They're not being rushed from one speaking engagement to a, you know, to their performance. And then, you know, now it's a workshop or, you know, there's, there's time for them to kind of engage with one another on a, on a more personal level. And, you know, I, you know, I I I, I would hope that that's, that's kind of the, the reputation or the, you know, the, the feeling that people are left with after being part of something I'm involved with. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So we've kind of talked a little bit here about, media Live. Let's talk about it more specifically. So for those people who don't know, there'll be a lot of 'em listening to this podcast. Media Live is a, it's more than an event, but, so what do you call, see, I don't even know what the names of these things are. So what is it? The Media Live? 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>It's, it's, it's a small festival, you know, like, okay, alright. Yeah, so, so it's a three day festival. It is produced by the Boulder Museum of Contemporary Art, and we, we do performances on, two evenings. On one day we will have a panel discussion and informal sort of artist interactions with whoever shows up. And then on the third day we have workshops. So it's a, it's a fairly common format really for, for small festivals that are sort of new media festivals that are, that have at least some performative component. And, you know, there are, there are tons of these things all over the world as you, I'm sure you well know. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I'm always, I'm always scared though, to call something a festival because that makes it sound like it's gonna be, you know, some equivalent of Bonnaroo or something and Yeah. You know, I don't wanna leave that impression some 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1992.12" data-end_ts="1992.28" title="1992.12" id=c_"1992.12">__Bar__</span> or something like that. Yeah, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But certainly like, the way you do it is, it is typical, but also it's a format that I really enjoy because you, you also kind of limit the number of artists so that if you're involved in the festival, you're going to end up having some personal interaction with these artists, which is really great. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Yeah. And I think, I think part of that is by necessity, and part of it is, is by design. You know, I, because of, well, certainly because of me and the way that I tend to get myself involved with all of the details of things, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2030.84" data-end_ts="2030.96" title="2030.84" id=c_"2030.84">__I__</span>, I'm not necessarily like a micromanager, but I, I also kind of know that like, stuff falls through the cracks unless somebody is paying attention. So I, I tend to be that person that's paying attention. So I I, I know that like anything longer than three days, and I, I'm gonna be like, I'm gonna be outta gas <laugh>. So, you know, so there's a certain amount of that that was geared towards like, well, you know, I, I think we really, and, and, and the involvement of the staff at <span style="color:red" data-ts="2058.87" data-end_ts="2059.16" title="2058.87" id=c_"2058.87">__bmca__</span>, which is has been fantastic over the years. You know, it's the same thing for them. They have a very small staff and limited resources. So, so the three <span style="color:red" data-ts="2066.26" data-end_ts="2066.48" title="2066.26" id=c_"2066.26">__day__</span> thing certainly is, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2068" data-end_ts="2068.12" title="2068" id=c_"2068">__I__</span>, I think designed with that in mind, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's kind of their limit as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Yeah, yeah, exactly. And, you know, the past two years we've, we've also, built this partnership with the Atlas Institute, which is part of, CU Boulder, and they have this huge immersive black box. The, well, it's not really huge, but it's bigger than BIM oca, and it certainly is outfitted for a different kind of performative environment, much more immersive. And, their involvement, you know, they, they have a great technical staff, so, you know, they, they tend to be the one evening's staffing for a set of performances. And what's cool about that is that we have typically on like opening night, we'll do it at BIM <span style="color:red" data-ts="2112.04" data-end_ts="2112.32" title="2112.04" id=c_"2112.04">__moca__</span>, it's a, it's an intimate environment. We can curate it such that the work that really works well in a small space that is, is all about being up close and, being sort of on a, a flat plane with, with the work, the audience and the work are on the same plane, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>That all happens that night. Then on the, the next night it'll be in that, that it's in that more sort of, immersive, theater environment where you, you are distanced from the work to some degree. Last year we had the, the light surgeons and, you know, I don't know if you've ever seen one of their performances, but it's just like, it's overwhelming. It's huge. It's Thea theatrical and, and pretty overwhelming and immersive, and it was fantastic. But, you know, you, you couldn't do that at <span style="color:red" data-ts="2159.88" data-end_ts="2160" title="2159.88" id=c_"2159.88">__be__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2160" data-end_ts="2160.28" title="2160" id=c_"2160">__moca__</span> space, right? Yeah. So, so I think having the contrast of those two things works really well for the festival because what we're trying to do is present work that is being done. You know, when you say it's about audio, visual performance, what, what does that even mean? You know, that's, that's like, it's, it's such a huge expanse that we try to kind of pick some things that can, that can showcase everything from sort of, you know, generative media to narrative kind of cinematic stuff, to theatrical performative stuff, to much more kind of screen-based, material to, things that are much more about like, you know, the interface and sort of the, device fetishism kind of thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Right. But we try to cover all of that in each festival and have like one or two artists that, that can plug into each of those kind of sub genres or whatever you call it. And so having those two venues is really helpful in being able to, to show the, the diversity in what's in, what's going on in that realm. Sure, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Media life has been going for how long now? 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>We are in our fourth year. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Looking at from the outside that it seems to be getting legs, you know, and certainly once, you know, when you were able to sort of like, get the attention of the Atlas people, that helped a lot. The Bmca the Bmca staff certainly knows how to engage their local community and the people that are, that are tuned <span style="color:red" data-ts="2255.44" data-end_ts="2255.68" title="2255.44" id=c_"2255.44">__into__</span> them. But, I noticed particularly last year hearing about it in different circles as if it was starting to get, it was starting to get legs and, you know, frankly, I saw that happen as communique also out of Boulder, started off very slow, and, you know, now they're, they're a force in that Yeah. Kind of art festival world. So, talking about media live and talking about the work that you've done and putting together events and festivals and stuff, what I see is you're a person that really activates, the artistic and musical people in your area. And so that almost by definition means it's something that, you know, I think we would all like more people to kind of get out of their chairs and do, my question for you is, what advice would you have for someone who <span style="color:red" data-ts="2315.19" data-end_ts="2315.48" title="2315.19" id=c_"2315.19">__said__</span>, who hears this and says, you know, maybe I could do a festival. What, what would you be your advice about getting started down that path 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>To go ahead and do it? You know, I <laugh> I mean, seriously, the, you know, the, the things that, that I think one needs to, to just make something happen. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2342.78" data-end_ts="2343" title="2342.78" id=c_"2342.78">__You__</span>, you have to, you know, you have to just connect with people. I think, I think the first thing is to sort of get out into the community and see what is going on, to get a feel for who, who is doing what, sort of, it's almost in a way kind of like market research. You know, you're, you're sort of getting a sense of what is happening so that you are not duplicating someone else's efforts. If there's already a certain kind of a, an event or a series or a venue that's already doing this kind of a stuff, well, you know, then by you doing it, you're, you're really just saying like, I'm not really paying all that much attention. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>I didn't, I didn't know that was happening. So, you know, so kind of doing your homework a little bit, but, but not letting that get in the way of what it is you really want to do. You know, if somebody's doing it and it's down the street, you can do it in your town. I mean, one example of that is I'm, you know, I started <span style="color:red" data-ts="2406.8" data-end_ts="2406.92" title="2406.8" id=c_"2406.8">__a__</span> little dork dorkbot, chapter here in Lafayette. You know, we're just outside of Boulder. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2412.66" data-end_ts="2412.88" title="2412.66" id=c_"2412.66">__We__</span>, we have this changing community, so I just decided, yeah, let's just do a dorkbot. That'll be cool. You know, it's like, it's easy to do. It's very informal. It's fun. And then people show up and then you start to see like who, you know, who, who lives here. Well, you know, what, you know, so that's kind of a thing, you know, the Dorkbot thing is a, a simple thing to, to do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>But you know, you go to your local cafe and you see what they have going on that's usually like, oh, you got open mic night. And then on Thursday, oh, well we don't really have anything happening on Thursday. Well, hey, you know, I know a couple of friends of mine and we have this, thing we like to do, you know, we, we, we do this art thing with weird electronic music and blinking lights or whatever it is, you know, and, we'll come in, we'll do it, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2459.72" data-end_ts="2459.88" title="2459.72" id=c_"2459.72">__it__</span> won't cost you anything. I notice you have a sound system here that you use on your open mic night. We can just plug into that. And, you know, so you kinda, I think the key thing is to make it as painless as possible for who whatever venue you're going to approach. And I, I would guess that, you know, people that are thinking that they want to do this sort of a thing, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2479.59" data-end_ts="2479.88" title="2479.59" id=c_"2479.59">__that__</span> they already have some technical skills, you know, they can just show up and plug in and do their thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>You clean up, you're nice, you're, you're courteous. You, you know, you say, please and thank you <laugh>, and, and you know, and then you're out <span style="color:red" data-ts="2494.32" data-end_ts="2494.4" title="2494.32" id=c_"2494.32">__of__</span> there and everyone's just like, oh, that was really simple. That was easy. You know, I would let those guys come back and do it again. And, you know, I think that that's been part of, you know, my whatever, if you want to call it success is just that, people trust, people gain a trust in that. Like, if you are going to be involved, it is going to be a quality event and it's not gonna be a nightmare. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. That's, that's incredible. Well, and certainly one thing you're never gonna learn in art school is to say, please, and thank you, or <span style="color:red" data-ts="2526.5" data-end_ts="2526.72" title="2526.5" id=c_"2526.5">__the__</span> arts, leave a clean campsite when you leave. That's something they never seem to talk about. They never get to that part of the gig. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Yeah. Yeah. That's, that's true. You know, there's a lot of things that I did not learn in art school, <laugh>, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Because of the work that you do with, with all these gatherings and events and festivals because of the work that you do in your teaching practice and just all of the, all of your personal artwork. And I, I certainly would suggest for people to just, do you, you have, dave fidel.com, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So if people can go and check out some of the work, you've, you've done stuff all over the map, but all of it seems to have a voice, which is interesting. That means that, you know, your soul is getting in there and that's cool. What do you see for the future? What do you see for your future and what do you think you see for kind of in general, the future of the art world? 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Oh, God, <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I always love that because people always just grimace when I ask that question. Yeah. It's like, oh, you're gonna hold me to this one, aren't you, <laugh>? 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Well, you know, okay. So I, I think the interesting thing about like, you know, when you say the art world, it's kind of like a meaningless term, because like, you know, the art, there, there are so many art worlds, I think, and that's one thing that I think that my experience in going back to school and getting the m f a and being sort of immersed in the sort of academic strain of, of the art world that showed me some things. And it showed me, an interesting strain of certainly I think American art. And, and maybe it's an, maybe it's, I mean, it's an international thing as well, obviously, but academia is, is this place that, I, I still don't know if I understand it, like it exists in its own little world, and it doesn't necessarily have to answer to anyone else. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>And I, I don't know if that's a good thing, or it sometimes <span style="color:red" data-ts="2654.02" data-end_ts="2654.24" title="2654.02" id=c_"2654.02">__is__</span> very frustrating because I'm sort a part of that and sort of not part of that. And I, I feel like that, you know, you, you look back at sort of like the, the trajectory of, avant-garde or kind of like the, the artists that thought they were doing something to change the world, you know, all of those people sort of ended up in academia like in the sixties and seventies and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2679.04" data-end_ts="2679.24" title="2679.04" id=c_"2679.04">__that__</span>, and, and now they're like the establishment, you know, it's like that revolutionary stance or that, you know, whatever you want to call that. Like, we're making a difference kind of a stance is like institutionalized. I don't, I don't know if that's, you know, I'm certainly not talking about the future. I don't know what I'm talking about really, you know, for my work, what I'm finding is that I'm, I'm retreating into the things that I really, that really just kind of feed me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>I'm building devices and I'm kind of rekindling my, my love of noise is kind of making a big comeback for me. There was a while there where I was trying to do what I thought was the right thing to do in order to kind of make a career for yourself as a, an academic artist or something. But, so I, I think I'm, I think I'm feeling positive about just doing this stuff that I'm doing and, meeting a lot of cool people through things like Media Live and, and the other festivals and shows that I'm involved with and, and just trying to keep it genuine and, and stay connected with something that, really feels like, like it has some, I don't know, cred to it, you know? Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, you know, again, I, I would say that while I talk about you as being one of the most multimedia of artists, it all, all the stuff you do seems to come from a place, and it's a place that's related to music and it's a relate, it's a place that's related to sort of like dystopian hacker, right? And, or at least that's the way I see it, and the fact that I've known your stuff enough that if I could see something and it was yours, I would probably have a sense that it was yours. You know? So there's that voice thing too. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>That's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2794.76" data-end_ts="2794.84" title="2794.76" id=c_"2794.76">__a__</span>, that's great to hear because you know, that's one of the things that you, that you hope 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>For Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>That you hope for as an artist. Yeah. That, you know, there's something that kind of comes through that people can recognize the work and say, yeah. You know, that's, I, I know that guy's stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I want to thank you for, your time. This has been a lot of fun. I've learned an awful lot about you and, well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>I'm glad I'm, I'm really thrilled that you, asked me to do it and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2820.16" data-end_ts="2820.32" title="2820.16" id=c_"2820.16">__hope__</span>, hopefully that is like entertaining and interesting to your audience. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It certainly was for me. So I think, I think everyone will appreciate it. And who knows, maybe you'll be the catalyst to getting other people to start doing festivals of their own. That would be pretty cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Yeah, that'd be awesome. Alright, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, thanks so much for your time and I will catch you again soon. 
</p>

<p>
<b>David: </b>Okay. Thanks man. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>All right. And there is the show. Thanks a lot for listening again. Thanks so much to Dave for taking the time. As you can tell from just hearing his story, really busy guy. He's got his fingers in a lot of pies and he's also constantly putting out new artwork. I happen to see something over at the Emanu Gallery when we were first scoping out the place. Again, if you're going to be in the Denver area on April 16th, 2015, please swing by the Emanuel Gallery on the Aurora Center, of U C D. Thank you for listening. And other than that, have a great week and I'll talk to you next time around.
