<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, today I have the pleasure of talking to Leaf Cutter. John, I have gotten a lot of requests for having John on the podcast. He is pretty well known anyway, but then, just recently he was a guest at Ableton's Loop event and I got like a half a dozen immediate requests saying, oh, you ought to talk to Leaflet John. So I reached out to him and he was nice enough to say yes. And so, with that we say hi to <span style="color:red" data-ts="43.045" data-end_ts="43.205" title="43.045" id=c_"43.045">__leave__</span> Kaja. Hi John. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leafcutter John: </b>I'm really good. How are you, <span style="color:red" data-ts="46.185" data-end_ts="46.405" title="46.185" id=c_"46.185">__Don__</span>? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm doing great. I was a little late to this because I've been doing some hellacious video editing, but now I get a chance to talk to a good guy, so I think that's gonna make my day a lot better. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leafcutter: </b>I hope so, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So why don't we start off by having you introduce yourself, talk a little bit about your work and some of the things you've been doing recently. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leafcutter: </b>Yeah. I'm a musician and producer. <span style="color:red" data-ts="71.585" data-end_ts="71.705" title="71.585" id=c_"71.585">__I__</span> started off as a visual artist. Graduated in 98 and moved to London in the uk. Tried to be a performance artist for about a year, and in fact, that was not really working out. I, I had this old computer, which I had bought to do my dissertation, and it made sort of rudimentary kind of bleeps and, and noises and I think you could sample as well. And I got really into that. And just as a hobby, I was really fascinated by the possibilities of it and sort of developed, body of Experiments, which I played to a friend of mine. And he, immediately showed me a load of records from Warp and Planet Mu that, that were in a similar kind of world and it's stuff I'd never heard before. So that, that's what got me going, really my friend introducing me to that, that world. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leafcutter: </b>And I was lucky enough to get signed, to Planet Mu, which got me going really. So that's, that was the start. That was like 99. And over the, the 15, 16 years, 17 years actually between, now and then I've been making albums and I've been playing with a jazz band called Polar Bear. And really my main interest is just exploring sound and trying to perform in a way which is not sort of stuck behind or tied to the laptop. So that's, a little bit about me and my latest project is a record called, it's called Resurrection. My girlfriend's telling me it's called Resurrection. And it came out on vinyl on Desire <span style="color:red" data-ts="180.765" data-end_ts="181.005" title="180.765" id=c_"180.765">__Path__</span> Records, which is, American Label a couple of months ago. And it's, and it's, yeah, it's on a nice <laugh>. It's on nice, clear, clear blue and green vinyl. So that's me. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's cool. That's a great introduction. So you, you started as a visual artist. You are now doing things that you say are, you're trying to transcend even the laptop, which sounds like a pretty aggressive path, even though it happened over a number of years. I'm first of all a little bit curious about when, when you talk about trying to go beyond the laptop, what, what exactly are you talking about there? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leafcutter: </b>What I mean by that is not to be tied to it in performance, really. I, I, I like what you can do with a laptop, and it's been very, it's been a good companion for me in both composition and performance. And of course when I started, it wasn't a laptop 'cause they didn't exist <laugh>. Right. So, or they were certainly beyond my means. So what I mean is more <span style="color:red" data-ts="241.115" data-end_ts="241.335" title="241.115" id=c_"241.115">__for__</span> performance is that I don't want to be stuck behind a laptop, basically <laugh>, that's basically 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So, so what do you use to mitigate that? What what tools do you use to get out away from the laptop? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leafcutter: </b>Well, I do a lot of sound recording, which is in the studio that, that gets me away and that gets me physically manipulating objects and, and other machines that are not the laptop. And then, <span style="color:red" data-ts="263.835" data-end_ts="264.055" title="263.835" id=c_"263.835">__and__</span> for performance, I developed this thing called the Light Interface, which is, 16 light sensors. The way that it works is that it can control, it basically controls different max patches and it might be, playing a track or it might be improvising with, with kind of different types of sounds. And it allows me to gesturally control, a performance. And it's really fun. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I am, I'm really curious because, you know, when, when I look at your work, it's, it's an amazing, there's an amazing breadth of work there, both musically, but then also sort of in kind of a DIY space. Right. And even here you talk about it, there's sort of like a, a builder maker kind of aspect to what you do. I'm curious about your background. I, I'm curious about how you grew up and, and the things you learned that help you became, become the artist that you are now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leafcutter: </b>My mom and dad were teachers. My dad was an art teacher. My mom was, she, she taught kids with special needs actually is what they might be called now. So very supportive parents. And, in terms of like emotional support, yeah, I, I, I thought I was gonna be an artist. I went to art school. I was always fairly relaxed about the kind of art that I wanted to make. So it might have been painting or it could have been performance or installation. I was, I didn't, I've always been really had that flexibility and I guess a kind of faith that I could do an idea using the right tools or using the right medium. So I've never really, I feel like I never really aimed for anything in particular, like, as a final goal. Like, I never wanted to make an album or I never wanted to have an exhibition or that stuff. But when it come, you know, I feel like by not grasping for it, I feel like those things have just come to me in a, in a slightly more organic way. So yeah. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, it's, it's interesting because, and maybe that's a, maybe that's a difference in, you know, almost a, a generational difference or something because it seems like I right now teach at <span style="color:red" data-ts="398.885" data-end_ts="399.005" title="398.885" id=c_"398.885">__a__</span> art school. But it wasn't that long ago that I was an art student. And, one of the things I know from that type, that time period is that the current group of people that is going through art school have a tendency to be really goal-focused. And really, you know, they try and identify how am I going to, you know, work? How am I going to get all these things happening? It's really interesting to hear that you kind of focused on allowing serendipity to kind of <laugh> kind of find a path for you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leafcutter: </b>That's, that's one of the elements of it. But I also work, I work really hard. There's no, I think there's no substitute for working hard. Right. And developing yourself. Yeah, I, I know what you mean. I've met some younger performers, maybe 10 years younger than me doing festivals and things. Their work's often really focused and they're really focused individuals. And that's a, it's a, it's a totally valid way of being. But yeah, it's not, it's not something that sort of, I feel a bit jealous of it sometimes. 'cause they seem to know where they're going. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Oh yeah, I, I hear that. That's true. You know, I am ancient by most artists, artists' rules, and I still feel like I'm grasping it, trying to find a direction. So there's that. Now I'm curious about the transition from you. You, you gave us just a little glimpse of the transition from doing visual art and attempting to be a performance artist to becoming a musician. You said you kind of did some, did some stuff, put it on tape, and, <span style="color:red" data-ts="502.105" data-end_ts="502.225" title="502.105" id=c_"502.105">__a__</span> friend of yours introduced you to similar things from some of these labels. What drew you in that direction and what was, I mean, give us, give us an idea how in 19 98, 19 99, what making music for an artist would've look like. Because I think some of the tools now are very relatable to artists of different ilks, but I think at the time, that wasn't really the case 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leafcutter: </b>For the artists that I, that, that my friend was listening to. And then later I was listening to it was, like there were Atari, sts <laugh> Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> doing, doing MIDI sequencing. There were, there was Luke vibe with his, three oh threes and that kind of, that kind of sound. Apex twin had like a <span style="color:red" data-ts="548.695" data-end_ts="549.045" title="548.695" id=c_"548.695">__right__</span>, well, quite a lot of equipment by that time. And what I was doing was, I had one, one program that could, convolve two sounds together, and I got really obsessed with that. It was called Hog and it ran on a pc. And it really, like, just, I used to would spend days just combining different field recordings together and maybe thinking, ah, if I could record this kitchen thing and combine it with this water sound, what would that sound like? Got really like, just totally fascinated, basically by the possibilities of that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leafcutter: </b>And then I was also making these long string instruments as well, which have a kind of tie into the fine art world. So I was just combining a load of stuff, basically whatever interested me. And then they were, the compositions themselves were fairly, fairly carefully edited together. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I think I was using, I bought the first sort of consumer version of Pro Tools, which was like a Digi Digi <span style="color:red" data-ts="610.985" data-end_ts="611.205" title="610.985" id=c_"610.985">__oh__</span> oh one. Yeah. Which, at some point I got rid of my PC and I got a, a Mac Tower and I don't really remember when that was. That's probably sometime around the first album, which was 2000. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. So, I mean, one of the things I think people would identify you with is sort of the sample manipulation. Did you ever use like sampling instruments or was it always sort of like recording and then editing 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leafcutter: </b>As in what? Sampling real instruments? Is that what you're 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="641.085" data-end_ts="641.245" title="641.085" id=c_"641.085">__Talking__</span> No, no. I'm talking about did you use a sampler device ever or were you always really just recording and then manipulating those recordings? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leafcutter: </b>I used to <span style="color:red" data-ts="649.245" data-end_ts="649.445" title="649.245" id=c_"649.245">__set__</span> like a hardware sampler. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Like an old <span style="color:red" data-ts="651.825" data-end_ts="652.045" title="651.825" id=c_"651.825">__Kai__</span> Sampler or something like that. Did you ever use any of those tools? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leafcutter: </b>Yeah, I, there was a time when EMU were discounting their sampler. So it was, it was either <span style="color:red" data-ts="661.485" data-end_ts="661.685" title="661.485" id=c_"661.485">__AKA__</span> or EMU, basically. Okay. And I got this one with a <span style="color:red" data-ts="665.965" data-end_ts="666.245" title="665.965" id=c_"665.965">__kind__</span>, a really nice filter board in it. So it had these, analog filters in it. I used, I used to use, you know, completely fill the memory up with tiny little sounds of, of of, of whatever. Right. And it wasn't a very big memory as well. It was really tiny. So I had a lot of very tiny sounds, very short little sounds. And then I'd do much longer recordings, manipulating objects basically, and combine those two things together. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. That makes, that makes sense. Then now what, for you, when you started all, when all of a sudden you kind of discovered, these labels that were sort of doing similar stuff for you, that timeframe, 19, the late nineties, the early two thousands, there was a lot of excitement about what was happening. I think a lot of, a lot of technology was changing and it really swung the door open to a lot of different kinds and new ways of doing sound processing. But also there were all these artists like you mentioned, like Luke and Ifex Twin and some of these other people coming on the scene. When you started listening to that stuff, how did it influence you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leafcutter: </b>Well, it's a bit intimidating when you start listening to the, the best electronic music, when they've had like maybe 10 years head start on you <laugh>. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leafcutter: </b>At that time, apex was doing really amazing stuff and, square Pusher two, and there was, there were a couple of ACA releases that were just incredible at that, around that period. It was definitely a thing that people were into at that time. There were lots of festivals and I never really quite fitted into that, but it definitely did influence me. I mean, I have my little theory on why each one of those people is good <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I mean, sure. I, I'm, I'm a big a <span style="color:red" data-ts="782.205" data-end_ts="782.525" title="782.205" id=c_"782.205">__Techer__</span> fan, especially from that time period as well. What do you think makes them, for example, special? I just kinda want to like pick your brain a little bit. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leafcutter: </b>What I, the only thing I listen to of theirs is, I think it's called EP 7.1 and EP 7.2 mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. I get a little bit obsessed with certain albums and they become, you know, I don't have a huge amount of stuff I listen to, but that's one of the couple of records that I listen to. And it, what I like about their stuff is it's kind of, it's really stubborn <laugh> and, and they're just doing their process. Right. And you get the feeling it's part of something that was hours and hours long and they've, and they've trimmed it down and, and made it succinct and they're really good at doing that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I would, I would agree that's, that's a great way to frame, frame them and frame their work. And it also, I mean, it's interesting to me to hear you talk about kind of becoming obsessed with albums. I think that one of the, I think that that's something that often happens with, musicians, is that you end up sort of like making these markers out of specific artists and specific work that they've done that sort of represent a place and a time and an influence that it may not be completely audible in what you do, but it becomes sort of like one of your almost emotional marker points in time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leafcutter: </b>For me, something like <span style="color:red" data-ts="873.715" data-end_ts="874.005" title="873.715" id=c_"873.715">__Auca__</span>, that that's a kind of avenue that I don't think there's any point in me going down that <laugh> that that road, 'cause they seem to, they've ticked that one off. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leafcutter: </b>But there's something really, I mean, on a, on a, you know, zooming out from specific tracks, there's something really great about the balance between mechanization and, and emotion, which is present in their music, which is pretty fascinating. Right. It's always something that I, I think is important to have in my music is this kind of sense of emotional play pushing and pulling them. And so I think I do it in a different way than, than <span style="color:red" data-ts="917.785" data-end_ts="918.005" title="917.785" id=c_"917.785">__or__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="918.075" data-end_ts="918.365" title="918.075" id=c_"918.075">__Teca__</span> at that period. But it's pretty, yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="921.945" data-end_ts="922.165" title="921.945" id=c_"921.945">__So__</span> I think it's beautiful music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well I, and I, you were just walking down a path I was gonna take too, which is it seems like that they take these processes and, and stuff like this and, but it ends up turning, you know, it ends up having a, having a voice and, and almost an organic nature. Even when some of these processes aren't very organic. I would say you do a di a different thing, but you have a similar result, which is that the end result seems really organic and it seems really personal and it seems to be a peculiar and individual voice. What would you attribute that to in your own work? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leafcutter: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="962.795" data-end_ts="963.085" title="962.795" id=c_"962.795">__Well__</span>, my voice? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I mean, do you think it's, it's because of some of your background, do you think it's more because of the things that you're drawn to as source material? Or do you think it's related to just your interest in obsessive editing 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leafcutter: </b><laugh>? Well, I, I'm not interested anymore in obsessive editing. It's something that I could do when I was in my twenties and early thirties, but it's not something that I can be bothered with anymore, to be honest. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and I'm pretty interested in a live gesture right now. But I think the biggest thing that influences what I sound like in any period is what I am fascinated by during that period. And the working process is always based around something that I'm fascinated it, with. 'cause then it feels like, it doesn't feel like work anymore if you're totally, you know, having a great time finding out about something new. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's a good point. That's, that's great. Now that also kind of points that discussion kind of talks more to the point of your performance type work or your actual performance work. So you just recently you apparently lit up the place at, the Ableton Loop thing. I wasn't able to go, but it sounded like that was like a lot of people were really inspired and pretty blown away by what you did there. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leafcutter: </b>It <span style="color:red" data-ts="1051.565" data-end_ts="1051.645" title="1051.565" id=c_"1051.565">__is__</span> nice to be invited to go. It's good to meet some of the, the, names and from my dealings with cycling over the last 10 or 15 years. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and and conversely a lot of them were very excited to meet you too. So it was a, it was a good opportunity there. Let's talk a little bit about performance and particularly something that I am obsessed with when I talk to people who are adept at both performance, but also have a body of recorded work. I get a little obsessed about one thing for me, I enjoy doing performance. I have a hell of a time putting a recording together, <laugh>. 'cause for some reason, a, a performance is I can, you know, I can set up what I'm gonna do. I get in front of people, I kind of blow it out against the back wall and then I shake everyone's hand and whatever it was it was, and whatever these people will take away from it, they take away from it. And that's great. When I try and do a recording, all I seem to be able to obsess about is, ah, Jesus, why did I do that one thing? Oh my goodness, this doesn't sound like anything like what I do now. You know, it's horrible. And I'm curious about how someone like you who really has a strong performative, angle, how you allow yourself to even do a recording. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leafcutter: </b>I struggle with some of those things as well though. And so it's not Yeah, you're not alone. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Well that's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1145.005" data-end_ts="1145.125" title="1145.005" id=c_"1145.005">__good__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leafcutter: </b>Well, I could talk a little bit about this band Polar Bear, which I've been part of for about well over 10 years now. And we've recorded I think five or six albums together. It usually works in the same way the albums written by the drummer and we rehearse a bit and we might play it live and then we just go in a studio and record it as a band U usually takes between two and five days and then, you know, someone edit edits it usually not me. So, I dunno, maybe I've been influenced a little bit by that. I dunno. It's, so, it is really difficult when you get overly precious about what you're putting down. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1185.015" data-end_ts="1185.365" title="1185.015" id=c_"1185.015">__Right__</span>. And because, because of the way that if you're recording on your own things build up layer by layer, it's really easy to be dis disheartened by the first few layers. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leafcutter: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And you, for me, I always try and remember that it's about one layer contextualizing another and that, and, and, and the possibility of one layer completely transforming what went before it, or putting it into the right context. So I try and just not to judge it before it's <laugh>, before it's, you know, before it's time. Sure. And also I find it's really helpful if I have a little story in my mind or a little, an idea of what this track, what the track is about or something that that means that I don't obsess about, you know, getting the perfect tin <span style="color:red" data-ts="1233.625" data-end_ts="1233.845" title="1233.625" id=c_"1233.625">__pan__</span> sound or something. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. That's actually a good point. If, one, one recording that I worked on where I was more of a producer than a than the artist, but yeah, I was just given a bunch of material and it was like, well, you know, try and develop something with this. And I was struggling to find an anchor and so I just decided, you know, for some reason I like tripped over something on the television or something. I was like, well, I'm gonna do something about the 12 Disciples of Christ out of this. Right. Well, there was nothing about this source material that represented that, but now all of a sudden I had a story and I could go and I could Google, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1271.855" data-end_ts="1272.075" title="1271.855" id=c_"1271.855">__oh__</span>, this one was like <span style="color:red" data-ts="1273.315" data-end_ts="1273.435" title="1273.315" id=c_"1273.315">__a__</span> weirdo tax guy or whatever, you know, and I could make up little stories out of each of their lives. And as ridiculous as that sound, it really allowed me to quickly put something together and not obsess about the tiny details. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leafcutter: </b>Yeah. That's, I think that's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1289.685" data-end_ts="1289.805" title="1289.685" id=c_"1289.685">__a__</span>, sounds like sometimes it's sort of thing you need to do. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="1293.925" data-end_ts="1294.085" title="1293.925" id=c_"1293.925">__is__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1294.085" data-end_ts="1294.245" title="1294.085" id=c_"1294.085">__it__</span>, you know, when when I work as a producer, then that's the kind of thing, I'm trying to do. I'm trying to make sense of what they're doing. Right. 'cause sometimes, you know, even an artist can be incredible, but they, sometimes it's hard for them to maybe communicate that with everyone else in the band or, it just needs something to, you know, so it means something to everybody basically. And, you know, if you're on your own, you've gotta, you're doing the producer role and you're doing the composer role sort of simultaneously. It's, it's, it's not an easy thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Yeah. I was just gonna ask about that. You know, since you, I mean, since you very formally in some cases perform the producer role, when it comes to your own music, do you, do you bring in other people to sort of like, fulfill some roles so that you don't have to obsess about 'em? Or do you kind of lock yourself in a room and go at it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leafcutter: </b>I try each approach until it stops working and then I change <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leafcutter: </b>It usually what I find is that, if someone is like, if someone at a label is kind of waiting for something, then I'm more inclined to make something. Right. And the last record only came about really because the, Michael, desire <span style="color:red" data-ts="1389.145" data-end_ts="1389.435" title="1389.145" id=c_"1389.145">__path__</span> expressed an interest really in releasing something. And then, just was very patient for two years while I, while I put something together basically. But that, I mean, that can go really wrong. Be <span style="color:red" data-ts="1406.525" data-end_ts="1406.745" title="1406.525" id=c_"1406.525">__the__</span>, that before that, there was an album that I was working on for another Michael, this was the, do you know Michael <span style="color:red" data-ts="1412.865" data-end_ts="1413.065" title="1412.865" id=c_"1412.865">__Ra__</span>? He's, he's in a band called The Swans. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh yeah, okay. Sure. I know of him. I don't know him personally. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leafcutter: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1422.725" data-end_ts="1422.945" title="1422.725" id=c_"1422.725">__Mm__</span>. He's a really interesting guy. And he, he wrote to me after hearing, an album called The Forest in the Sea, which was like a kind of combination of electroacoustic music and kind of a folkish thing. Right. And he really liked it and he sort of said, oh, I'd like to release something, whatever you do, you know, I'd be, I'd be into listening to and releasing maybe. And I got kind of, I started listening to some other people on his label and I got really overly influenced by the stuff I was listening to. And my music completely changed, and I made a load of music and sent it to him, and he was kind of, yeah. He was kind of into it. And then after about a year, I felt, God, this is not me at all. And I said, we can't do this <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, no. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leafcutter: </b>Yeah. So I've got like a couple of albums worth of songs, which I cringe every time I, every time they appear <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. It's, I, you know what though, I think that that happens more often than people even want, want to suggest and, and sometimes not, you know, again, I hate using my own self, but that's, I your, your stories are really ringing bells for me here. I recently did a festival and, they asked me to do a live performance, kind of a live performance in combination with doing some DJing. So I was doing some live work, and then I would switch over to another, you know, another artist's work. And in order to make it so that there was kind of a thread through it, I was using all these, artists that are on the Raster <span style="color:red" data-ts="1520.915" data-end_ts="1521.205" title="1520.915" id=c_"1520.915">__Noon__</span> label. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and, like Al de Novas I'm obsessed with and some of these other folks. But it was weird because as I was putting together those tracks that started influencing so much that everything I made sounded like it was coming right off of those records. And it was, I listened back to the recording I made of the performance and I was like, oh my God, I I maybe listened to that a little too much. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leafcutter: </b><laugh> <laugh>. Yeah. It's interesting. It's, when, when there's an aesthetic <span style="color:red" data-ts="1551.955" data-end_ts="1552.245" title="1551.955" id=c_"1551.955">__that__</span> she's so strong, like that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1553.765" data-end_ts="1554.125" title="1553.765" id=c_"1553.765">__raster__</span> stuff or maybe like <span style="color:red" data-ts="1556.635" data-end_ts="1556.925" title="1556.635" id=c_"1556.635">__Orca__</span> has a pretty strong aesthetic. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="1560.265" data-end_ts="1560.485" title="1560.265" id=c_"1560.265">__so__</span> some of the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1561.075" data-end_ts="1561.365" title="1561.075" id=c_"1561.075">__Apex__</span> stuff too, like he seems to have a couple of aesthetics that he operates within. It's can be daunting, I guess to if you, if you approach it like, how am I gonna, how am I gonna make this completely unique aesthetic, then that's probably the wrong way. It's the most intimidating way of, of, of going at it. I think. I think most stuff comes from somewhere and, if you're really good, then you just steal it. <laugh>. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. Yeah. We call that synthesizing in, in art, right? <laugh>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1594.045" data-end_ts="1594.165" title="1594.045" id=c_"1594.045">__Yeah__</span>. You synthesize it into your work. You mentioned there a little bit about some of the tie-ins that you have where you seem to be combining, electroacoustic, you know, almost like classical electroacoustic and computer music with sort of a real folk influences Mm-Hmm. What is it about the folk thing that resonates with you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leafcutter: </b>Well, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1616.545" data-end_ts="1616.765" title="1616.545" id=c_"1616.545">__may__</span>, maybe I can start that by talking about something electroacoustic music. Actually, when I was on Planet Mu I was, I met up with Mike who, this guy Mike <span style="color:red" data-ts="1625.815" data-end_ts="1626.165" title="1625.815" id=c_"1625.815">__Perus__</span>, who's the, the guy from Planet Mu Records. And he had this MiniDisc that he was listening to. We all had MiniDisc players in that, in that day, <laugh>. Right. And I loved him 'cause you could record onto them. And he had this mini <span style="color:red" data-ts="1640.345" data-end_ts="1640.565" title="1640.345" id=c_"1640.345">__dis__</span> that Apex twin had given him, and it was absolutely mind blowing. And I listened to it. We were, I remember we were on a tube and I listened to like one and a half tracks and I thought, this is amazing. I'm gonna keep this. And he wouldn't let me <laugh>, he wouldn't let keep it. So I wrote down what it was, and, and then I thought, right, I'm gonna buy this. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leafcutter: </b>And it was, it was out of print. And I had to go to this place in Elephant and Castle to try and buy it, and it wasn't there. And then I put a message on a, on I think some message board and some guy just sent me a copy of it in the mail. And it was, Bernard Palm's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1682.465" data-end_ts="1682.685" title="1682.465" id=c_"1682.465">__Rum__</span>, which is like kind of, I think it's from 76. And it's, it's, to me it's, it's like, it's telling me a story. It's very natural and it's very kind of, it's just in incredible piece of music. And to me it just makes me want to sing. So that's like where the, you know, the folky thing comes from just telling a story. I think that's what I, that's what interests me about folk music is the kind of narrative element of it. And it, and, and that, that album, the, the Par album sort of awoke something which made me feel like singing. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So I'm not familiar with this work. It's what, what is it? Is it, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leafcutter: </b>It's a, I think it's, it's a piece with limited source material. So it's got, it's basically made with tape, I think, as far as I can work out. And, it's got a sine wave generator and it's got a wine glass and it's got some kind of orchestral instrumentation as well, but they're all processed really heavily and it's just, yeah, I mean you need someone like Keith Fullerton Whitman to tell you how more about that <laugh>, how it's made. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1762.785" data-end_ts="1763.005" title="1762.785" id=c_"1762.785">__But__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1763.005" data-end_ts="1763.205" title="1763.005" id=c_"1763.005">__them__</span>, I'm sure he would know. I'm sure 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>He would. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leafcutter: </b>Yeah. But for me it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1766.485" data-end_ts="1766.645" title="1766.485" id=c_"1766.485">__the__</span> more the, I don't really want to know how it's made, but it's kind of, it sounds like it's a tape piece and it's, it's got that kind of overdriven kind of quality to it. You should check it out. It's a pretty remarkable record. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. It sounds, sounds amazing. I will have to track that down. So, so the sound of that and, and sort of like the desire to make you sing and, the, its ability to tell a story to you that speaks to folk music for you, how did you then extend it to start using like, folk instruments and doing, doing things that were more a direct tie to folk music? How did that come about? I mean, did you have, did you have some background that was like really full of folk music or was it something that you searched out? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leafcutter: </b>To be honest, I never, I never really directly investigated it, but things kept happening that were bringing me in contact with folk musicians. I see. Like, I made an electroacoustic piece out of a, my, a mandolin that I had in my studio, and I always, I always wanted to sing on the record. So like, on my first record, this singing at the end of it. But I don't think anyone ever made it to the end of the record. So no one ever <laugh> <laugh>, no one ever heard it <laugh>. So I think there's singing on all of them actually. But yeah, it's something that I like doing and, I I, yeah, I like it when electronic people sing <laugh>. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's interesting because, you know, for me the, some of the things that like Laurie Spiegel did and stuff like that sort of nodded together electroacoustic and computer music with folk stuff, but it was mostly doing folk <span style="color:red" data-ts="1876.005" data-end_ts="1876.295" title="1876.005" id=c_"1876.005">__like__</span> tunes or melodies or whatever, with those instruments. And, and it's kind of interesting to imagine a different take on that, which is to say, you know, let's use the instruments and let's use voice. I mean voice. I think one of the reasons people actually get into electronic music is because they hate the sound of their voice. Right. <laugh>. So, it's kind of interesting to think of drawing the voice into that kind of music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leafcutter: </b>Yeah. It's vocal course have a funny, I think it's, it's interesting to look at instrumental music and stuff where the voice features, but in a very minimal way. And what happens when the voice appears? Like where does that, where does that pull the ear? And it always, as soon as the voice comes, you are glued to it. Right. I don't remember much about my dad's Mike Oldfield album, but I do remember that a voice comes in, announces the instruments. So it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1937.995" data-end_ts="1938.075" title="1937.995" id=c_"1937.995">__a__</span>, you know, he comes, I think he, he, he appears and he says mandolin, and then the mandolin comes in and he says Tubular bells and it plays that <affirmative>, the, the theme. And, and Kraft work, you know, had had their own way of approaching the voice. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. And it's interesting because if you think about like the most memorable electronic music tunes, they all have like melodic bits or <span style="color:red" data-ts="1962.645" data-end_ts="1962.805" title="1962.645" id=c_"1962.645">__for__</span>, or for the most part, they have melodic bits that are almost vocal or you could almost sing them. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leafcutter: </b>Some of it. Yeah. What, just out of interest, what is the most memorable electronic tune? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, that's a good question. I, I guess I, I was thinking of something of like helson and on on or, you know, some of the old, orbital things to me are the ones that I always thought that their melodic things were almost vocal lines, that they just use a synthesizer instead. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leafcutter: </b>Yeah. Yeah. Wasn't the first piece of electronic music that Daisy song was it, was that the first thing played by an electronic in, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2005.605" data-end_ts="2006.005" title="2005.605" id=c_"2005.605">__Series__</span>? Oh yeah. The, the first thing, that they had a computer Yeah. Produce was, Daisy. Right. And, and they ended up kind of making a joke of that in, 2001 Space Odyssey. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leafcutter: </b>Yeah. When it all goes wrong. When 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It all goes wrong. Yeah, exactly. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leafcutter: </b>Yeah, it's, I mean there's, for me that's, I think part of it's a kind of, I like the idea of singing, but I quite like the idea of being up there singing. There's something, there's something that allows, that connects you with the audience that, in, that you can't do in any other way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I think, I think you're, you're, you're right about that. And I also think in terms of just, I think there's an emotional connection. There's, there's psychological and even physiological things that have us respond to human voice, you know, in a, in a very visceral and strong way. And that's gotta exist in music as well as in daily life. You know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leafcutter: </b>I totally agree with you. I think it's, and it makes me think about what I've been doing with my light interface, connecting the physical action with, with the reproduction of sound, which is basically what, you know, most acoustic instruments do. Right. But you do it in an electric context, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2090.175" data-end_ts="2090.395" title="2090.175" id=c_"2090.175">__in__</span> electronic music context. And it blows people's brains a bit. Like if, if I, if I play in a small place where the audience is close and they can see what's going on and I can hear them, I'll do my first few strokes with the lights and like nine times outta 10 someone says, whoa, that's magic 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Right. I haven't seen, seen this. Is there a video on you performing with this somewhere? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leafcutter: </b>Yeah, there is. There's on my YouTube <span style="color:red" data-ts="2118.065" data-end_ts="2118.355" title="2118.065" id=c_"2118.065">__that__</span> I think it's, if you search for light interface, then you'll see it's like a super responsive, instant electroacoustic machine. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. So do you have like light sensors where you break the light or are you like shining a light at the light sensors? How does, what physically how are you interacting with the sensors? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leafcutter: </b>Yeah. Shining my bike lights and various, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2140.425" data-end_ts="2140.645" title="2140.425" id=c_"2140.425">__so__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2140.645" data-end_ts="2140.805" title="2140.645" id=c_"2140.645">__the__</span> novelty lights at the sensors and I spent a week talking about different musical interfaces in various, workshops in Germany recently. In fact, leading up to the Ableton thing, Uhhuh, there's something about the fact you can't control where the light goes all the time. <laugh>, which is a bit like when you play a guitar, you know, you get these, you get resonances and you get sympathetic vibrations, which are really natural and, but you know, kind of hard to model. Right. The light, the light behaves in a similar way and it's also unpredictable. So if the light guy suddenly turns up the lights, then he's, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2178.405" data-end_ts="2178.695" title="2178.405" id=c_"2178.405">__into__</span>, he's playing then. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I was just gonna ask, how do you <span style="color:red" data-ts="2181.615" data-end_ts="2181.735" title="2181.615" id=c_"2181.615">__d__</span> deal with that when you're on a stage and not controlling the light environment you just live with whatever the result is? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leafcutter: </b>Yeah. You, you have to have a sense of humor. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Did you ever like, get upset and just like, throw your body over the top of the sensors just to make it all stop 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leafcutter: </b><laugh> <laugh>? I never, I don't, I never got upset. 'cause honestly, it's a lot of fun and if the lighting guy forgets, then it's kind of hilarious. 'cause you can say, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2207.915" data-end_ts="2208.135" title="2207.915" id=c_"2207.915">__oh__</span>, well you step away from it and, and then he or she will realize <laugh> what's going on. Right. Right. But there's a bit in the show where people can shine their torches on it and their iPhones or their, whatever they've got. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, I was gonna say it probably becomes iPhone central at that point. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leafcutter: </b>Yeah. And some people have got really kind of stroby ones and Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah. It's really fun. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2233.315" data-end_ts="2233.535" title="2233.315" id=c_"2233.315">__Oh__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That sounds like, that sounds like a blast. I, I just now looked and I realized that I've, I've used up my allocated time for you, but, or the time I asked to have from you, but I want to ask one more question because I think that this'll be helpful for people. You, when you talk about your background, you don't talk about it being a heavily technological one, but you certainly do use a lot of technology or at least hack together a lot of technology for the work that you do. What were, what was the method by which you sort of approached technology? I mean, did you, did you have, was there something in your art training that prepared you for it or did you just dive in and say, I'm gonna figure this stuff out? And I ask this because on one hand you do max MSP programming and so you seem comfortable with the computer programming world, but also you're, you're, you really kind of have a background doing DIY type stuff and you know, you're hacking together <span style="color:red" data-ts="2295.665" data-end_ts="2296.015" title="2295.665" id=c_"2295.665">__light__</span> sensors and stuff. So there's sort of a circuitry bent to what you're doing too. How did you get comfortable with all this stuff? How did you approach it in a way that that felt comfortable to you as an artist? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leafcutter: </b>Back in 95 when I went to art college, they, the, in the first couple of months, they taught you how to stretch a canvas, how to make the frame, how to grind your own pigment. And that simple knowledge that you can make your own materials had a pretty profound effect. 'cause up until that point, I thought you bought a canvas in the size that you wanted. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, and that you bought tubes of paint. But this idea that, well, looking at where that stuff comes from, like a lot of paint comes from different kinds of soil or different rocks, or, or underwater sea creatures or stuff like that. You know, it's, it's quite fascinating where pigment comes from. And I sort of carried that through really think that what made me comfortable with making things was right back to when I was a kid and I'd go to my grandparents' house and that wasn't a huge amount to do, but there was this shed which was full of wood and nails and screws, and we'd generally make something. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leafcutter: </b>And I think that the idea of like getting your hands dirty and just building what you want is, is something that comes right from that back from that period. And it's reinforced through art school and it just means you're not limited to what anyone else decides you should be working on or working with. And then the light interface uses an Arduino, which is brilliantly supported in the community and it's, it's like, a really great example of open source, an open source project that has got a brilliant community and a very giving community around it. And basically I just, you know, sat down as a novice and learned a little bit of code, adapted some example patches, and then sat down with the serial object and worked that out. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and just, you know, just accrued that knowledge on my own really. Like, it's not difficult to do, you just need to dedicate a little bit of time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's a really interesting story and, and an interesting way of, of viewing that. I think we don't, we have a tendency to sort of disconnect stuff that uses electronics from the rest of the world. But that's a beautiful way to frame it, that you're working with your own material and you're learning how to build things. You're learning how to build your own, create your own material instead of just buying solutions. That's awesome. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leafcutter: </b>Yeah. That's goes for the, the sort of sound world as well. So I think it's important that people continue to make instruments and experiment with different ways of using the sound that's already around us, you know, and, and try and push things. Don't be afraid of, I mean, I think the, the biggest freeing thing that has ever happened is to realize that I'm never gonna be any of the people that influenced me. And having the kind of confidence just to let go of that and explore my fascinations and then realize that that is what I am, the sounds that come out of that is my music. And that's the, I think that's the key thing. And it's just, you know, I think it's sometimes difficult. I find it difficult to fully believe that sometimes, but you know, when I'm in a good mood and things are working out, that's what it feels like. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. John, I want to thank you so much for taking the time, to sort of like wander around concepts of influence and, and technologies and how to get work done. That's, this is stuff that's always really fascinating to me anyway, and I appreciate you sort of like putting up with my, stumbling questions. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leafcutter: </b>No, they were good questions. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Cool. Well, so thank you so much and I hope we'll get a chance to, to talk again soon. Maybe meet up at a festival or something and, and hang out. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leafcutter: </b>That'd be great. I actually look forward to that.
