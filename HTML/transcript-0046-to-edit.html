<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, well, I'm getting ready to post this week's podcast. <span style="color:red" data-ts="11.88" data-end_ts="12.1" title="11.88" id=c_"11.88">__An__</span> Adobe audition just, helped me very efficiently, eliminate the audio bed I <span style="color:red" data-ts="19.5" data-end_ts="19.66" title="19.5" id=c_"19.5">__had__</span> recorded. So I've got a little work there to redo. Thanks a lot. Adobe audition. Anyway, this week's, interview is one that I've really been looking forward to because it's talking to someone who's an expert in <span style="color:red" data-ts="37.22" data-end_ts="37.34" title="37.22" id=c_"37.22">__the__</span> area that I don't really know very much about. This is a chat with Katie Wood. I first met Katie at a party. I was, visiting a friend's house <span style="color:red" data-ts="49.88" data-end_ts="50.1" title="49.88" id=c_"49.88">__in__</span> her <span style="color:red" data-ts="50.36" data-end_ts="50.58" title="50.36" id=c_"50.36">__PAs__</span>, and he invited Katie over to the party and she was incredibly engaging. I was a bit of an idiot, and she actually just glossed right over it. It was cool. And, the more I heard about her and the more I heard people talk about her, the more I wanted to find out more about what she did. So, luckily she was willing to take the time to give us a, an opportunity to chat. And this is it. I hope you <span style="color:red" data-ts="77.98" data-end_ts="78.34" title="77.98" id=c_"77.98">__enjoyed__</span> as much as I enjoyed doing it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>All right. This week we have a very special guest. Her name is Katie Wood, and she was introduced to me by my friend Andrew Pask. She's part of my, like, personal New Zealander posse, I guess. But she is the person that I, I would say that for this podcast. She's the person who has the longest Im DB listing. She's, a sound editor and dialogue editor, and now a supervising editor, for a lot of films. And I'll actually let her talk about what she does, but, the consummate professional. <span style="color:red" data-ts="126.64" data-end_ts="126.86" title="126.64" id=c_"126.64">__And__</span>, one of the things that really tweaks me about Katie is that, when I talked to Andrew and when I talked to other people that knew her or that know her, she's the person that they trust to do their most detailed work. That is always, to me, a sign of excellence, when people that I trust, point to another person as being the most trustworthy person ever. So, with that weird introduction, I give you Katie Wood. Hi, Katie. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy Wood: </b>Hi, Darwin Very good. Thank you for such a glowing, glowing introduction, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I didn't make it up. It, it just does seem like you, you really have people's attention as being, super detailed. You have and having great ears. And so when, you know, that kind of trust factor in the sound world is a little bit hard to run by now, before I run too far down the, the, I love you so much track. Why don't we have you explain a little bit about, your job and, and how you identify yourself. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>Sure. Do you want me to explain a little bit about the process as well? I mean, I, I'm not entirely sure how many people out there, you know, understand how the process works from filmmaking or not, but also I don't want to, you know, talk to people out there stupid, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? I think, I think it would be useful if for no other reason than, there is a lot of mystique around the whole Hollywood, art world. Anyway, so I think it might make sense to talk a little bit about the process and then how your work fits into that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>Okay, sure thing. Well, I'm a sound editor, first and foremost really. And basically what happens with the film is they shoot it, they, edit the picture and then this is in simplistic terms. Then I handed over to sound people to tidy up the existing sound, add new sounds and so forth. And then those elements come together in a mix. And so those elements are divided extensively when it comes to mixing into four basic food groups. You've got dialogue, which is obviously all the chatty stuff. You've got sound effects, which is, you know, cars, car starts, explosions, twitty, birds, cicadas, et cetera. Then you've got Foley, which is, basically anything an actor does with their hands or body. So it's footsteps and <span style="color:red" data-ts="288.7" data-end_ts="289.18" title="288.7" id=c_"288.7">__rustles__</span> and bag movement and all that sort of thing. And then you've got music. So those four elements are what come together. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>It is what comes together in the mix. So, oftentimes when I say that, we work on the sound as sound editors, after the picture cut that somewhat premature because most of the time these days, budget dependent, of course the picture is still being edited while we are working. So we, there's a certain point where we're concurrent and particularly any film that has heavy visual effects because, you know, they're scrambling as we are in the post-production process to do so at the end. Right. So, so I have worked in all those aspects for the most part, probably the least with music other than maybe sort of producing the odd thing and you know, maybe mixing it down and so forth. But I'm not, a musician and, and music editing for film is kind of a different, it requires a skill set that I don't have, nonetheless, of which is being able to read music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>So all those elements come together in the mix and then we sort of ship it out and everybody goes, yay and clinks their glasses. So that's the oversimplified sort of way of how that happens and how long that process is and how many people are involved and all that sort of thing. I depended on budget and schedule and sometimes those are intrinsically mixed and sometimes they're not, because you can work on a very low budget, project with very few people that just has an insanely long schedule because the nature of it, perhaps it's an ongoing documentary piece or it's just something that's a bit of a passion project. So you work in pieces. So in which case it's not so much dependent, it's entirely dependent on, on budget. It's entirely dependent on schedule. And then you can work on other things, which similarly go for an incredibly long time with a whole bunch of people because they just have way too much money and off it goes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>So, yeah, that's kind of it in a nutshell about the process then. So basically what happens is I'm brought onto a project, depending on whether I'm a sound supervisor or as a, sound editor, it depends on the timing, but a lot of the time these days we're really, we're not brought on terribly early in the project. You know, the, the picture cut's been done and will be brought on, you know, a few weeks before the end of the director's cut process. Okay. And a standard, a standard, American, you know, kind of Hollywood director's cut period is 10 weeks. So that's 10 weeks from the end of shoot where they get to make an assembly, cut a rough cut, put it together to show whoever financed it. That's sort of a standard thing. I think even in New Zealand, Australia and England where I worked, it was sort of similar-ish depending on the deal. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>So that gives the, the director an opportunity to put the cut together and then at that point they screen it and we may be brought on early in the process to, do what's known as a temp mix. And a temp mix is where we maybe have just a few weeks and we pretty much just grab all the elements, dust its bottom, mix it and ship it so that it makes it a little more palatable for a studio head or somebody to watch or something like that. So we may be brought on then, or we <span style="color:red" data-ts="501.1" data-end_ts="501.22" title="501.1" id=c_"501.1">__may__</span> be brought on after. And when I say brought on, what we do is we then look at the film and whatever state it's in and start making notes about what it needs, what issues it has, where it's at. So if I'm wearing a dialogue hat, I'll be looking at, okay, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>What do we got here? What's the state of the original tracks? How was it recorded on the day and on the day? I mean, obviously when it was, you know, shot the scene was shot, you know, what, what issues might be there. You might discover that there weren't really any usable radio mics. So you've gotta do everything off the boom, the boom being there. Mic dangling in the room is against the laval mark, attached to the person. Right, right. Or you might find that the whole thing is such a visual effects heavy thing. And it's, so it could have a big budget and a very good sound recorder and all those sorts of things, but the entire time the person's wearing a rubber suit prancing around a green screen with a fan on <laugh>. So, you know, and so that sort of renders that somewhat useless as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>So you can come up with all sorts of issues that can have absolutely nothing to do with budget or the scale of the project, you know, the issues are the issues. So then you start looking at, okay, well we're obviously going to have to adr, we're gonna have to loop a lot of these lines, and ADR stands for additional dialogue replacement. And that's <span style="color:red" data-ts="579.44" data-end_ts="579.66" title="579.44" id=c_"579.44">__our__</span> loop. And what it is, is we bring the actors in again to, you know, redo their lines or maybe we changing them and yeah, we get them to do that to picture or maybe not. And that's basically the ADR process and, and recognizing early how much of that you might have to do is important. So, then we look at all those sorts of things and, you know, start working with the director and all that sort of bits and pieces. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>Then if I'm wearing perhaps an effects hat or, you know, if anybody's doing effects, they're gonna be looking at what are the different environments, what are the different backgrounds, is there anything that's really specialized or specific? Is there a prop in the film that's used that is unusual or specific? Like it could be a film where, let's say it's, it's got a lottery scene in it, so it has this very specific little mechanism with a winding handle and a mesh net and all these little ping pong balls going around or something like that. Sure, sure. So you might need to go, okay, well that's kind of a specific thing, you know, we might need to go and record that. So you're looking for the things that are going to be time, you know, that are gonna take time and are special. And you're also watching the film, whether you're doing dialogue or effects, you're looking at it for what are the special moments. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>And you know, and this is also apart from the spotting session that you'll have with the director and the picture editor at some point. But, you know, you're just looking at it on its own merits and you're going, okay, well this is obviously a big moment, you know, and you can tell that cause either it's an emotional scene or perhaps it's, it's, and you can just tell on the arc of the story. It's a, it's a, it's a turning point or something. So you're looking at that and you're looking at it for, okay, how many sound design elements of it does it have a lot of creatures in it, you know, that aren't there yet? So basically the main character's standing there talking to a ping pong ball on a pole <laugh>, you know, that they're eventually is going to become a very large, scary monster. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>And, you know, but until then, that's what they're looking at. So you're like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="703.52" data-end_ts="703.74" title="703.52" id=c_"703.52">__ah__</span>, I wonder what they're talking at too. So I try to get the script before I start a job if I can, but a lot of the time you don't. But once I start the job, I get the script and start looking at what perhaps the intention was of the writer. And then the director's realization of that, can also be very revealing, you know, how close it sticks to it or not. But you start to pick up things in the script and, and you know, you read that and it sort of describes the environment and that can be very revealing. So there's that part of the process. So you start spotting the film yourself, then you'll have a session hopefully with the director and the picture editor and run through the movie and talk about lines that might need to be added that they foresee and things they might want do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>And, you know, maybe talk about scenes that I think are issues for badly recorded dialogue because of the conditions or something. Or maybe the, this is a, you know, a sound design moment and what was, and ask about what was the vision for that and see what you can kind of glean from that if you have an opportunity as well. It's nice, I think sometimes with some of those conversations to try to, you know, have them over as long a period of time as possible, schedule allowing, because then you can get to know the people a bit better. You know, sometimes <span style="color:red" data-ts="783.22" data-end_ts="783.58" title="783.22" id=c_"783.22">__enough__</span> to tell people this before that it's quite good if you're working with somebody you've never worked with before and you just kind of, you start finding out what sorts of things they like. So you might start talking about what kind of food they like. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>And you start, you have these endlessly long conversations about restaurants and sort of realize you haven't really done any spotting session, but in that time you've kind of learned the nature of that person. So sure. It makes it a bit more personable. So it, it helps to build a working relationship because you're basically trying to discover a language that's mutual at that point, because sound <span style="color:red" data-ts="816.9" data-end_ts="817.1" title="816.9" id=c_"816.9">__is__</span> in, you know, is intangible. And it's something that some people find quite easy to convey, especially if they're experienced directors and editors and so forth, convey what they want. And other people will only be able to tell you what they don't like. But somehow you've gotta find a way to communicate so that you are able as a sound editor to deliver what it is they're after. So you have to find that language and ways of expressing yourself and understanding how they express themselves. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure, that makes a lot of sense. Now, in, in the course of, in the course of your work, you've worked with some pretty high end people. I mean, you've worked obviously with Peter Jackson in all of the Lord of Rings, a series you worked with, Peter Segal and the, <span style="color:red" data-ts="868.24" data-end_ts="868.46" title="868.24" id=c_"868.24">__and__</span> Get Smart for sure. You worked with Clint Eastwood on a number of films, but I know from our past discussions you come from humble roots. What, what is your background? What is it that got you to where you are? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>Well, a number of things, sort of fell into place. Let me think. So yes, I'm from New Zealand, but, as a kid I traveled around a lot because my father was in the Navy, so lived in a number of different, places in New Zealand and, well, a couple of different places in New Zealand and, some places around the world. So that was quite advantageous, I think for any kid. You know, you always makes you a little more curious. But, I'd always, always been interested in sound in terms of how things sound, you know, like birds and so forth. And, but, I think the thing that made me aware of, sound being added to things, which is where I've ended up, you know, now, is, when I was a kid, there was a TV show in New Zealand called Radio Times. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>I think that's what it was called. Anyway, it's a long time ago now, and what it was, was a bunch of New Zealand comedians, would go around, small provincial theaters and perform a radio play. And I grew up listening to the radio a lot. I still actually really <span style="color:red" data-ts="957.06" data-end_ts="957.34" title="957.06" id=c_"957.06">__like__</span> radio and radio players and all that sort of stuff. And, so they would perform these sort of plays and, they would have all kinds. So they were on a stage and every now and again, they would knock some of their props over cause they would have like a tray of sand or something and they'd do the footsteps and all that sort of stuff. So Right. Which I found fascinating. Every now and again, they'd drop a prop and then they'd have to incorporate that. Like they were on the radio <laugh>, so it was kind of, they were doing some sort of, you know, circa 1940s sort of thing set in the jungle <span style="color:red" data-ts="995.2" data-end_ts="995.42" title="995.2" id=c_"995.2">__in__</span> Burma. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>And then one of them would knock over a door and then they'd have to say, oh, great, I'm so glad you found that portal into the other universe. You know, they just make stuff up, which I found fascinating and hilariously funny. Sure. You know, kid, it was just silly. It was improv, right. And, it was really cool. And so that started my understanding pretty early on that things, you know, of the process I guess, and how, how much fun it looked. And, so, you know, I did various different things and I ended up, I worked in lots of, well few music venues and stuff like that over the years on the bar. And I was never quite confident enough to, to head towards the, mixing board or anything that was always terribly intimidating. And, so, but I did a few courses and this, that and the other and eventually ended up, in, going on location shoots with a, sound <span style="color:red" data-ts="1053.88" data-end_ts="1054.3" title="1053.88" id=c_"1053.88">__record__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>So a location, sound recording is, is of course a different thing to what I do now, but, learning about boom operating and that sort of recording. And it was, it was great. It was really good. The, the, sound recorders is very good. Sound <span style="color:red" data-ts="1072.54" data-end_ts="1072.94" title="1072.54" id=c_"1072.54">__recorders__</span> called, Ken Sil <span style="color:red" data-ts="1074.22" data-end_ts="1074.34" title="1074.22" id=c_"1074.22">__and__</span> New Zealand still working, fabulous guy. And, I learned a lot. But I also realized that I was more interested in the more creative side of things, which is post production. Sure. So I sat in with various people that I was introduced to who did Soundpost and at this time in New Zealand, we're talking mid nineties. And you know, there really weren't very many people in the country who were doing it full time. There was maybe, I don't know, I might get slaughtered for this guess, but I'd say <span style="color:red" data-ts="1105.58" data-end_ts="1105.7" title="1105.58" id=c_"1105.58">__it__</span> was about 25 people in the whole country doing it full time, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>Right. You know, doing features and TV series and all that sort of stuff. And then of course, you know, in terms of sound editing, then of course there's mixers and technicians and other people as well. Right. So I sat in and basically I wouldn't go away. And they finally gave one in particular, lovely man called Mike Hopkins, gave me a job on a film, and I really didn't know terribly much at all at that point. But, he'd decided that my attitude was appropriate, <laugh> <laugh>. And I think it's true that one's attitude is the, probably the most integral thing to, keeping you in post-production because otherwise why the hell would you do it? And, you know, you've got to have that kind of drive. So I, continued doing it and learning lots of stuff and I still, and I just kept going with that and, worked <span style="color:red" data-ts="1160.9" data-end_ts="1161.06" title="1160.9" id=c_"1160.9">__in__</span> New Zealand for a number of years on all kinds of shows and films and tv and also supplemented it with, sound recording and boom operating and stuff when I could, not that I was, I wasn't terribly good at that, but I did it <laugh> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1177.56" data-end_ts="1177.78" title="1177.56" id=c_"1177.56">__or__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1177.78" data-end_ts="1177.98" title="1177.78" id=c_"1177.78">__tried__</span> to and, did that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>And then, work ran out in New Zealand. I got very quiet as it does in most countries. It comes in, you know, ebbs and flows. And I, ended up, going to the film school in Sydney called the Australian Film, television and Radio School, which was great cause they're incredibly well, it's changed quite drastically now, but it was very well, funded. So they had great equipment. And because I knew already how to do my job, ostensibly, I just wanted to fill in the gaps because I think anybody who, well, anybody doing any kind of profession, but particularly if you do so, I think, on an experience base where you walk in and you just start working, right, you know, you, you end up with a lot of gaps in your knowledge. And I really wanted to fill some of that stuff in. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>So that was exactly what managed to achieve, and that was really cool. And then I continued to work in New Zealand, so I worked in Australia after that for a couple of years, and then came back to New Zealand to work on the Lord of the Rings Triology. And, after the end of that, I lived and worked in England for a while and then came over to the States and definitely having worked on, Lord of the Rings, and actually by that stage, I'd done a stint back in New Zealand between England and the us, on King Kong as well. And those being such big, films and, celebrated films as well. Right. It made it a little easier for me to be able to introduce myself in the US and, work here. It wasn't necessarily a planned goal, though, any of this. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>I had no intention actually whatsoever of coming to Hollywood and working in Los Angeles, or even living in Los Angeles. It kind of just worked out that way. I know it sounds terribly intentional, but in fact, I saw myself, you know, swinging wines or Sangria and Spain and occasionally bopping over to London to do some sort of fantastically arty film from Finland. Yeah. So I kind of had that concept in mind. It just didn't quite end up that way for a variety of other personal reasons. So it was, all and all very good reasons. So the fact that I'm here now, is fantastic. But, it wasn't, it definitely wasn't a straight line <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Well, I I'm not sure that any real artistic, life ends up being a straight line. I think the people that plan on being artists end up being like baristas at Starbucks, right? Mm-hmm. And the, the people who are willing to go with the wins are the people that end up succeeding in, sort of, the artful life. And yeah. That's, that's quite a, quite a trail you took to get where you are today. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>There are a few other bits in there, but you know, <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Well, and, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1362.74" data-end_ts="1362.94" title="1362.74" id=c_"1362.74">__but__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>That's another conversation, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, okay. We'll, we'll look into that. So I have, some questions. First of all, I wanna talk about this idea of you going to film school in Sydney to fill in the gaps. I think that that's actually a really, really interesting way to, kind of frame what you did, because my, my assumption is after working in New Zealand, on a lot of TV and film things, it would've been very easy for you to just say, yeah, I've got a lot of experience and I can kind of grind out a career, just doing this in some way. What is it that drove you to, to kind of dive into school again and what are the, what are the actual gaps that got filled in in that process? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>Well, my drive was also that I felt, you know, and this comes back to one of your earlier comments, which, you know, was kind and not cruel, I don't think, where it's like, yeah, New Zealand is a small country down the bottom of the earth. And I always, I never planned on living there even as long as I did, you know? So I wanted to go out into the wider world and with, and with a, something I wanted to be doing as well, you know, how did I wanna fill my days? So I, my drive to, you know, stretch my wings a little further, I guess is the easy way of putting it. Going to Australia was the next easiest option. So I'd only been working in my chosen career, I guess, for that, at that stage, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1460.08" data-end_ts="1460.3" title="1460.08" id=c_"1460.08">__but__</span> for about three years. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>Okay. And in, in, I mean, I, I think it's a little different here, but generally in, in my profession <span style="color:red" data-ts="1472.04" data-end_ts="1472.26" title="1472.04" id=c_"1472.04">__and__</span> sound editing for film, you know, it's about the time you've spent doing it, the longevity, the experience you have. And so, and there is an expectation that you'll work as an assistant for quite some time. Like, you can work easily as an assistant for, I don't know, eight years. Okay. You know, and, and definitely in days gone by, especially when people worked on film and therefore with sound, it was on Mag. There was a, there was definitely that kind of length of time it just took, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1507.97" data-end_ts="1508.29" title="1507.97" id=c_"1507.97">__because__</span> it was such a long process at that stage. Right. And so there is definitely a, there is that, and I think there's a lot to be said for taking your time to get there, not of your own volition, but also not to be, necessarily assuming you're gonna know it all. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>There's so much to know, which quite frankly is part of the reason I love it so much because, you know, you can't run out of things <laugh> Right, right. To learn or know about. That's the most, that's one of the greatest things about doing sound for film or sound in general. It's like you'll always discover something new, whether it's a new instrument, an aspect, a toy, or whatever. You know, there's always something different, a new creative <span style="color:red" data-ts="1551.53" data-end_ts="1551.65" title="1551.53" id=c_"1551.53">__o__</span> opportunity, a new, way to approach things. So, so yeah, going to Australia was kind of, to the film school there and the gaps that I wanted to fill in were, were kind of varied. One of them was that I'd often worked for other people and I learnt how to do a whole lot of, cut a whole lot of sounds and, you know, specific sounds and sound effects for things and learnt from what they'd done. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>But I hadn't really had much of an opportunity to be sound designing and doing, you know, the whole package, I guess. And obviously you're not gonna do that on a feature film when you're starting out, but you need to do that on say, short films and, you know, those sorts of projects. And what I wanted to do was have that opportunity by going to somewhere like a film school where there's always people turning out these films and they're not necessarily films you're gonna, like, there could be a whole lot of navel gazing anyway about that. But, you know, you go, and that's a challenge in and of itself. You know, that means you've actually gotta work with people and you've got to hear them tell you their ideas and actually keep a straight face and, and try to help to realize what it is they want, whether you agree with it or not, because it's not up to you and it's not your bloody film, you know, it's their film. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>So that I think was a great, thing to learn too, that I was, I was looking for. And the other thing was that I, because I hadn't come from any kind of engineering background, I really wanted to fill in some of the technical aspects of, you know, being at least able to, you know, give a cursory glance to understand a schematic and, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1650.32" data-end_ts="1650.54" title="1650.32" id=c_"1650.32">__so__</span> sort of things together and, and understand a lot of the, some of those really basic sound or, you know, some of the engineering, the physical engineering stuff. So, I did a course in as part of the film school for about six months at night, teaching a whole lot, or learning a whole lot of that stuff. And it was excellent. So, so there was kind of those basic things that I wanted to learn, you know, and, for better or for worse, I certainly did some things better and some things worse, but that's how you learn. And that was a, a good environment to do it in. I did a lot of films and then because I had, I was fortunate enough to already know how to use everything, as I mentioned, gear wise and all that sort of stuff. It wasn't such a mystery. So I just, anybody who wanted their film sound <span style="color:red" data-ts="1701.08" data-end_ts="1701.3" title="1701.08" id=c_"1701.08">__cat__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1701.38" data-end_ts="1701.5" title="1701.38" id=c_"1701.38">__I__</span> was doing it, you know? And, that was, that was great. That taught me a lot. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. You know, as, as I look at, and I have to admit that, in your case, the I m IMDB database is actually a really good cheat sheet for me. And as, and as I scan this list, I see that you went from, you have a couple of assistant listings, but then you pretty much are a sound and dialogue editor. But in 2009, 2010, I see supervising appearing at the front end of a lot of your job description. So what's the difference between a sound editor and a supervising sound editor? What's the, what's the differentiation there? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>Well, it's basically, the supervising sound editor is, as it sounds, you know, you're in charge. And when I work as an effects editor, dialogue editor, Foley editor, whatever, I am working, there is a sound supervisor, and the sound supervisor's job is to ostensibly be the main liaison with the client and which is the director and editor and producers and so forth. And they're the ones that on what isn't the most crucial part of, well, is it the crucial, I don't know. But it's, it's, it's, the deciding factor is when you're on the mixed stage. So on the mixed stage is where the decisions are made, and that's particularly where a sound supervisor is kind of making those choices. But they're, they pick the team of people that will be working on it. They'll, whether it's two people or 10, you know, or 30 or whatever. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>Sure. And they, they're aware of all aspects of the film, and they often have people they trust so that they can concentrate on things particularly. And, you know, they'll be talking to people and they may provide some of the sounds, you know, they may like to, you know, in my case, if there's, because a lot of the time these days I'm cutting more dialogue and adr, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1822.64" data-end_ts="1822.86" title="1822.64" id=c_"1822.64">__oh__</span>, that's just sort of how things have ended up. And that's totally fine. But when I'm sound supervising, I like to try and cut more of the effects and any of the sound design moments, which is more of the non-literal stuff, just because that's an opportunity for me to do. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's an opportunity to be creative, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>Right? Yeah. It's an opportunity to be creative and, you know, and I, and it's, it's, it's really fun too. So it's like, ah, if I'm gonna be the one in charge, I wanna have <span style="color:red" data-ts="1850.3" data-end_ts="1850.42" title="1850.3" id=c_"1850.3">__some__</span> fun as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Of course. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>Maybe you're always the one, the last person to leave, but damn it, I'm gonna enjoy it. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, so, since sound design is what you view as sort of like the creative thing, what are some examples of, of sort of extreme but fun sound design tasks that you've taken on? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>One aspect is that, I guess one of the things I feel about it is I, I have this sort of love hate relationship actually with the term sound design, because these days it's kind of bandied around a bit as a kind of cool kid concept, right? And in fact, if, if truth be known, anybody who works in Sound is a sound designer, whether it's the Foley artist who's walking the footsteps, they're designing the sound of that Sure. Know, they may have had information communicated to them from by the Sound supervisor or you know, somebody else. But, you know, it's, it's, it's all designing a sound. It's all designing a, you know, an aspect of it. So I think of sound designer as being these days, it kind of, for a better description is like, any of the non-literal elements, or if there's creatures and creature design, like someone like I had the, privilege of working with people like David Farmer and Tim Nielsen who both, hail from, Skywalker Sound in San Francisco, and they're both fabulous sound designers and, and totally in that way, you know, where they do creatures and, you know, kind of really cool stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>And it's, it is a particular genre and it is a particular thing where they're concerned. I would absolutely agree with that. But on a, I guess another film, like on a, walk and talk, you know, a picture which is maybe just a drama and people are doing stuff, you know, getting to design the sound. Let's see, this film, did, won't Back Down, which was, you know, smallish film and it was, but it's set in a, a lot of its set in a sort of working class area, Pittsburgh. So, you know, I went, we wanted to definitely convey that one of the main characters lived in a lower socioeconomic area. So I went down to, skid Row in, LA and drove around basically sticking my microphone out the window. And I kindly had a, a wing man who helped me out, and he, was ready to drive quickly if we needed to, to just kind of get that vibe of people talking stuff in the streets. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>Sure. And you know, what that sounded like, and the bus station being really nearby and, you know, you do stuff like, you record televisions through thin walls, right. And so that they're incoherent, but everybody knows what that sounds like and all those sorts of things. So I kind of think of those as being a bit of a sound design moment. And that's actually really fun to do. It's quite exciting to, to run around doing that. Or a film, I was doing earlier this year, which, set in a kind of marina, so I spent a whole lot of time recording marina stuff at Marina Delray here in, Los Angeles. And, listening to all the different birds and realizing that pelicans actually don't really make much of a noise <laugh>. And, but there's all these other things that do. Sure. And, you know, so you do all that kind of stuff, and that's really fun. And then you put that together and that becomes, you help to create the soundtrack that way and put people in that environment. And that's, it's, it's really fun to do those sorts of things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now when you're, when you're doing, when you're particularly doing like background or environmental sound like that, you're still picking up <span style="color:red" data-ts="2080.8" data-end_ts="2081.02" title="2080.8" id=c_"2080.8">__pr__</span>, specific instances of sounds. So if you're driving through Skid Row with a microphone <span style="color:red" data-ts="2088.86" data-end_ts="2089.14" title="2088.86" id=c_"2088.86">__sitting__</span>, hanging out the side of your car, right. And some drunk guy basically gives you the great big <span style="color:red" data-ts="2096.64" data-end_ts="2096.86" title="2096.64" id=c_"2096.64">__hey__</span> kind of a thing, right. Do you have to get clearance to use that? Or is it just like, well, you shouted in a microphone, thanks a lot. I mean, what is, what is the protocol for dealing with stuff like that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>Well, in an instance like that, it's a little hairy. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I bet. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>Yeah. I mean, if technically what you would have to do is yes, you would need clearance to use that person's voice. And that's how that works. You know, if you are in a situation where what I was doing was I wasn't, you know, I was stationary when I was recording, if there's just like a clamor of people down the end of the street or something, or somebody coughing, then it's something you're picking up in general. It's not specifically that person. So it doesn't, it means that you're not identifying them. Now, the legalities of this, I could get myself into really hot water if I start getting too <span style="color:red" data-ts="2148.55" data-end_ts="2148.9" title="2148.55" id=c_"2148.55">__speci__</span> specific on this stuff. Cause I don't really Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So I don't want to get you in trouble, please. So I'm gonna avoid that. But I think it's actually a really interesting thing to consider because I've, I've done some, some location recording just for my own artwork. And I've always been surprised when I come back to the studio and I wind up the wind up the sound and I start listening to it, I'm actually really surprised at how many sort of like sight and time specific things that I hear, right? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, you know, whether it's a person talking and I'm like, man, I didn't even see them, but now, now I can remember them walking around behind me and now I have this whole conversation. Right. What are some of the tricks to getting, to getting sort of like the right environmental sound without picking up a lot of that stuff? Because I would imagine in a, in a film background, you don't want things that are easily identifiable. I mean, you don't want to know that it's skid <span style="color:red" data-ts="2214.58" data-end_ts="2214.74" title="2214.58" id=c_"2214.58">__row__</span> of LA versus, the ghetto of Pittsburgh, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>That's right. That's right. No, you're, you're looking to try to create a somewhat more generic environment, but with that vibe. So you, I tend to approach it in two ways, and I think it's kind of done. I wouldn't be, I won't say that everybody does it this way, I'll just say, this is the way I do. But lots of people do. If you've got something that's a little more general and sits into your, what you would call your background, pre <span style="color:red" data-ts="2243.3" data-end_ts="2243.46" title="2243.3" id=c_"2243.3">__dub__</span> your pre-mix, and in the background you'd have like your wins and things would be sort of separated based on the nature of what they are. You know, you might divide 'em by wind would be one ub, another one would be insects and birds. Another one would be, you know, maybe, background cars and that sort of thing. And what you would always try to do is if there was something that happened that was quite dynamic, you know, something that would only happen periodically, et cetera, then you would keep that in a separate Pred <span style="color:red" data-ts="2275.14" data-end_ts="2275.22" title="2275.14" id=c_"2275.14">__dub__</span> or you would use those sounds. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>You know, like maybe there was something that I recorded in Skid Row that I really liked, but was quite distinct, so you wouldn't wanna put that in your background. So you'd put that in your sound effects ub, so you'd I see. Be able to keep it separate so that you have control over the level of it so that you can either feature it or not. Right. So, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2295.46" data-end_ts="2295.7" title="2295.46" id=c_"2295.46">__cause__</span> a lot of this is really just about control, so you can still get the vibe of the city, the distant echoes and the things that sort of make more of a wash, and then any of the specifics. Now that depends on the project as to how dynamic your backgrounds are. But yeah, in terms of tricks of how to record them, it's really trial and error and just listening to what you're recording as you go, if you can, even if it's just earbuds or you know, whatever, you're still gonna get at least a bit of an idea about what you're recording. And yeah, I've recorded plenty of like cafes and restaurants and all that sort of stuff, and you've always got that. Not always, but often you have that one person who's really freaking loud, <laugh>, it's like yapping away there and you're like, ah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, you're screwed up my day, man, if 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>You listen. Yeah. Just because the way your microphone's pointed, you're like, ah, how can I do this? So you just need to reposition, position your mic or something. Sure. Or you just move to a different part of the room or something. I mean, I, I find a lot of the time the best, you know, recording technique is just to move <laugh>. Right. You know, you just go to a different part of whatever it is that you are trying to record. Right. And, you know, you can find something that is maybe more appropriate to what you need or has less, less of a, a con a constant element that you don't want, whether it's a fire alarm or, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well now I can imagine walking around a marina with a microphone and probably not being bothered too much. I can't imagine sitting in a cafe with a microphone and not having everybody either come up to you and say, Hey, what are you doing? Or conversely saying, can't use my voice. You know, how do you, how do you even accomplish some of these things? I, I can't even imagine. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>Well, thank God for technology where stuff's gotten smaller, <laugh>, that makes it awfully easy. That's made it much better. But, you know, you'll be surprised how innocuous you can be. Anybody who's worked in, you know, theater or any of those sorts of things understands the concept or even on, on film sets of what, what draws people's eyes, you know, you can actually suddenly become quite, I wouldn't say, invisible, but you can, you can sort of, you can move around and you just get yourself into a bit of a position and you just try not to draw attention to yourself. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And I imagine in LA it's maybe a little bit more common too to see people walking around and doing that stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>Which in some ways makes it more difficult to be honest. Oh really? Yeah. Because people are that much more aware of it. And so as against, if you are somewhere where people are not so aware of the process, they think you're doing something, they dunno what it is, but they're too embarrassed to ask you what it is, because then it'll show what they don't know. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>People are very weird like that. But 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, so, so in LA you get a lot of people coming up and giving you their business cards and saying, well, if you ever need help on the sound stage, just let me know. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>You know, that hasn't happened yet, but that'll be pretty funny when it does. I guess I, I don't roll it out. I, yeah. But no, it'll be more like, people are like, oh, what are you recording? You know? Cause then they, they've picked, they've pegged what you're doing right. Or whatever. And, but I, you know, when I was wandering around the marina and stuff, people would just kinda look at me funny occasionally, but, you know, you can sort of wander around and if you don't make too much eye contact, you know, it's all just wandering around trying to be as innocuous as possible. You can sort of not do it. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2516.22" data-end_ts="2516.34" title="2516.22" id=c_"2516.22">__And__</span> occasionally, you know, you'll realize when you get your recording back, you'll hear somebody going, I think she's recording 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>I dunno what she's doing, but we should be quiet now, <laugh>. And then they whisper incredibly loudly for the next like, 15 minutes and you go shoot 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. How much of the recording work, like the location and, and like sound capture work that you do is specific to a project? And how much do you do just to build up a library for your own use? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>Well, in my case, like I said, over the last few years I've ended up cutting a bunch more dialogue than, sound effects. Sure. So in fact, a lot more of the time when I've been recording sound effects, it's been for my own edification, you know? <span style="color:red" data-ts="2560.6" data-end_ts="2560.82" title="2560.6" id=c_"2560.6">__Yes__</span>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2560.97" data-end_ts="2561.26" title="2560.97" id=c_"2560.97">__When__</span> I've, when I've been traveling somewhere in particular, like a couple of times, you know, a bunch of times being in South America and things like that, and I'm like, hell yeah, I'm gonna record something, right? So, you know, for that time when we go back to eighties films about drug lords or something, you know, and so it's just really kind of, because it's an interesting environment. I'm being flippant, but it's because it's an interesting environment <span style="color:red" data-ts="2583.54" data-end_ts="2583.7" title="2583.54" id=c_"2583.54">__and__</span> somewhere new it would be for that. But, generally when I do a film, and I know a lot of people feel exactly the same, you know, we try to do something special for the film that we're working on, you know, something that makes it specific and something that is special for it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>Whether it's recording in Skid Row or whatever, something that, or a lot of people like to do as well, you know, it's kind of, it, it, it personalizes. I think it helps to personalize the project a bit more. You're a bit more invested in it. Of course, you don't always have the time or anything to be able to do that, or the inclination, et cetera. So, you know, then you'll be pulling from your library of stuff to, to achieve the same kinds of ends. And certainly I, you know, rely on the library pretty heavily when I'm doing any of that sort of stuff. And potentially other people's libraries too. You know, every now and again, we'll be working on a project or whatever and somebody <span style="color:red" data-ts="2641.34" data-end_ts="2641.42" title="2641.34" id=c_"2641.34">__will__</span> be like, Hey, have you got any street sounds of da <span style="color:red" data-ts="2643.98" data-end_ts="2644.1" title="2643.98" id=c_"2643.98">__da__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2644.1" data-end_ts="2644.26" title="2644.1" id=c_"2644.1">__da__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2644.26" data-end_ts="2644.46" title="2644.26" id=c_"2644.26">__da__</span>, or wherever, you know? And so there, you know, there is a bit of camaraderie and some exchange that goes on. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So how much, how much of that is faking it? So for example, if someone says, Hey, do you have any street sounds from Jakarta? And all you happen to have is street sounds from Detroit, are you, are you able to pull it off? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>No, no. In that, in that, that kind of instance. No. I mean, you know, it'd be more, that's more of a friend thing where somebody says, Hey, have you got any, I see great sounds <span style="color:red" data-ts="2677.46" data-end_ts="2677.66" title="2677.46" id=c_"2677.46">__of__</span> Jakarta and so forth, so you wouldn't steer them down the garden path on that one <laugh>. But, I see your point, but no, something as specific as those kinds of things then, you know, you can't, what's the, what are the familiar sounds that everyone thinks of when, it comes to, I don't know, you say New York, it's always high rise, honking horns and all that sort of stuff, right, right. With maybe a background of construction and industrial stuff. But basically it's those honking horns, you know, with the slap that comes off all the tall buildings and all that kind of thing, you know, so you can't turn that into necessary something else unless that is that environment. And, you know, the sounds of, say Jakarta are very different because of the type of vehicles that are driving around, you know, it's more diesel, all sorts of stuff. And, you know, the burden and insect life is, you know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Well, I mean, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>But yeah, it's, it's, yeah, you can't, you can fake some things. One of the best ways to be able to fake it if you can, is that you have <span style="color:red" data-ts="2741.9" data-end_ts="2742.02" title="2741.9" id=c_"2741.9">__a__</span> chance to listen to even a really bad recording of what the place sounds like. So then you can start to piece those elements together from scratch. So then, yeah, you could conceivably go, okay, it's these types of diesel cars. All right, what has those type, let's find some recordings of those types of car that have that sort of sound. Okay. What sort of crickets and, you know, insects might we hear from <span style="color:red" data-ts="2766.74" data-end_ts="2766.9" title="2766.74" id=c_"2766.74">__that__</span>. Okay. And so, yeah, it is conceivable to build it, but you do need, you need something to go by to begin with if you're trying to make it believable. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. And now I'll just admit that I pulled, you know, the street sounds of Jakarta like completely outta my ass. Sure. And the fact that you're coming at me with, well, there's diesel and you have to think about these kind of insects, just sort of like points to the level of detail and sort of like the vision for a soundscape that you have that I don't have. . And that's what makes you a pro at it. So my question would be, how can you ever watch a film and not be completely distracted by the sounds? Especially, you know, and I would say not, not so much a film, but especially like television, cuz even I as sort of like a schmuck, when it comes to, when it comes to some of these things, I will watch a, you know, some bad cable TV show, right? Mm-hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b><affirmative> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And even I can tell, you know, there's that same lightning clap that I've heard 150,000 times and there's that same scream or there's that same dog barking rhythm that I've heard a million times. You know, you hear these sort of like, ultra stock sounds, how must drive you mad? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Especially, especially if they're misused or misplaced. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>Oh, yes. But I tend to, I don't know, I'll just speak myself and that, I do still really get caught up in stories, even if they're bad ones. So I kind of follow what the characters are doing and what their intention is. And so I don't notice when, like if I go to a movie, I will have a cursory understanding of the sound, but I'll generally only, focus in on it more if it's either really, really good or really, really bad, you know? Sure, sure. It tends to just go with the extremes. If it's not either of those things and somebody says, what <span style="color:red" data-ts="2896.1" data-end_ts="2896.22" title="2896.1" id=c_"2896.1">__does__</span> this sound like? I'll be like, fine. I think <laugh>, yeah, because I really, I was caught up in the story enough that it didn't matter. I, I can suspend my disbelief in that regard, but also that, that conversely, in fact, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2911.74" data-end_ts="2911.94" title="2911.74" id=c_"2911.74">__if__</span>, if anything, you know, sometimes I think it helps to keep me amused, you know, where it's like, if I'm watching something that's truly awful, I, which, you know, I've watch a bunch of stuff also as research, you know, in terms of what people are doing and you know, or maybe it's stuff that my friends have worked on or people that I know or I'm just curious or something. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>And sometimes that can be horrible, you know, from a film point of view as a story. But, you know, being able to get caught up in the detail or be caught up in the details and kind of be like, oh, that was an interesting choice. Oh good. Nice thunder. Yes. You know, so I'm sitting there listening to all the sounds and stuff, and that'll keep me amused if the story isn't. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Sure. Now, man, we're already deep into the amount of time I was gonna suck outta your evening, and I really appreciate it. So I'm gonna take the long list of things I wanted to ask you, and I'm going to whittle it down to just a few remaining questions. But one of them is really, is, is really a curiosity for me. When I was, doing some background research on you, and surprisingly I occasionally do that, I ran across something called the Virtual Katie, and it appears to be someone virtualizing a process that you did. Can you explain how you became a software package? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b><laugh>? Yeah. Wow. Since you put it like that <laugh> <laugh>. Yeah. Well, it was actually, friend of mine, John mackay, lovely man, very talented, very smart, and he and I and a whole bunch of people working on the first Lord of the Rings project, fellowship of the Ring. And we were getting through enormous amounts of changes. The picture was changing a lot because of pr, principally because of the visual effects really. So, you know, things just, they come back at, they can be moved by a frame or two, you know, and when you're talking a whole film, it's just, it's tons and tons of changes. And basically what happens in a, in a nutshell is okay, if there's picture changes and the sound is already started, the sound post-production, then sound follows picture, right? That's how it works, right? So if they chop five feet and five frames out of the picture at a certain location, then you have to do so with the sound. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>So there's a few different ways of doing it, which I won't go into at the stage and everybody be snoring, but, the way, the sort of classic way is a chain, what's known as a change note is produced. So that says, okay, at 926 feet, and we <span style="color:red" data-ts="3094.84" data-end_ts="3095" title="3094.84" id=c_"3094.84">__are__</span> using feet and frames here, but you can do it in time code, say 926 feet and one frame, we're gonna remove five feet in five frames, you know, so it's a location point and then a duration of how much needs to be removed, or maybe it's added or maybe things are moved around. So you have to follow each one of those steps and they must be done in an order. You know, you have to start at one and end at what, 300 or however many changes you've got. Sure, sure. And because it has a ripple effect, you know, it pulls the picture up. So now that picture is five frames and, five feet, five frames shorter, but it means the shot that came after it has to be pulled up as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>So that gap is filled by what was, what was five feet and five frames later, if you know what I mean. Got it. Sure. Sorry, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3146.86" data-end_ts="3147.08" title="3146.86" id=c_"3146.86">__not__</span> explain. Am I explaining that in a Yeah, yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3149.04" data-end_ts="3149.44" title="3149.04" id=c_"3149.04">__Horribly__</span> convoluted manner. But I think you get the idea where it's like you're making something, you're <span style="color:red" data-ts="3154.01" data-end_ts="3154.68" title="3154.01" id=c_"3154.01">__concerting__</span>, right? Something. So what, so we would just get these enormous change <span style="color:red" data-ts="3160.96" data-end_ts="3161.2" title="3160.96" id=c_"3160.96">__lights__</span> the size of a bloody phone book. And, I would go through them, quite swiftly and kind of interpolate the difference. Cuz what happens is sometimes there's a lot of visual effects, shots and all that sort of stuff. So in fact it doesn't make any difference to sound. Let's say for example, they've done all this stuff, they've changed all these pictures and that's how it's represented on the page. But in fact, nothing really changed in the sound or very little. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>So I would go through and do these calculations and, with film it's, a lot of, it's basically, anybody who's done a bit of algebra, it's base 16. And, so you kind of, you do a bunch of algebraic equations, very simple ones, minus and plus. So it's not too complicated. So I would be, I was part of that process and John, being an intelligent guy and so forth was, and he's <span style="color:red" data-ts="3213.42" data-end_ts="3213.46" title="3213.42" id=c_"3213.42">__a__</span> New Zealand chap, and he just felt that this was extremely inefficient what we were doing, which it was. So he, came up with, with a couple of other people who work with some different ways of doing things that would, that would make that more efficient. And, you know, it was a series of quick keys and all that sort of stuff. And then, he turned it into its own piece of software that would make those changes and initiate them. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>So you could compare, compare basically an old cut that has tons and tons of chops in it with a new cut, and it would interpolate the difference and voila, you have a, the cut, the old cut chopped up, but in the places where it needs to be in the new cut. And it did so in a, using what's known as an e dl, an edit decision list, which is ostensibly just saying, okay, it was there, this shot was here, it has this marker number, you know, cause there's all these trace backs to the original to what was shot, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The original shot, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>Yeah. And they had, and it has a unique identifying feature in that sense. And so, okay, it's now been moved to this, it's had its head trimmed off, it's had its butt chopped off, and now it's there, you know, and, and so basically the edit decision list tells that information and that can, that's imported into, virtual Katie and, so forth. And that's, there are other, programs that do this process, by the way, that's not the only one. And this was a number of years ago. So, my friend John, and unbeknownst to me, because I'd done so much work with all the, you know, doing that job and, chopping things up and interpolating the change notes and so forth, he, named it after me as also a way to personalize the, the situation because it's, it's the sort of job an assistant would do and it would be their time and everybody's time would be much better spent if a program did it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, sure. And I, I imagine that for people that'd have to, that'd have to run across something like that. It's, you know, probably easier to say, well, I might be able to relate to a virtual Katie more so than the Wonder Editor 2000 or something. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>Exactly. Exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>So that's the, the kind of, the nutshell story behind that one. But, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's, that's incredible. That's, and again, I don't know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="3368.21" data-end_ts="3368.5" title="3368.21" id=c_"3368.21">__Plus__</span> software, what more could any of us want? That's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, when all of a sudden you're unemployed and, you know, you'll, you'll be in the Home Depot parking lot, you know, with, we'll do sound editing for food. Yeah. Well, I'll be able to point at this discussion as to why that might have happened. That's <span style="color:red" data-ts="3388.14" data-end_ts="3388.26" title="3388.14" id=c_"3388.14">__not__</span>, you got virtualized completely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>I was rendered obsolete, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Now, my one final question then is to what extent do you see, sort of like automated systems replacing jobs in the sound editing world, and to what level will there always be the need for people to be able to make artistic decisions? You know, I think it's one of the things, especially in sort of the more technical aspects of large format art, there's this sense that, well, you know, some of the drone work is, can be done by automation, but we still really need, we still really need a person to grace it. Do you think that that's gonna always be the case? Do you think that there's gonna be ways that things get virtualized, or do <span style="color:red" data-ts="3434.74" data-end_ts="3434.78" title="3434.74" id=c_"3434.74">__you__</span> think that there's <span style="color:red" data-ts="3436.5" data-end_ts="3436.7" title="3436.5" id=c_"3436.5">__all__</span>, it's always going to remain sort of like this human art? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>I think it's always going to have an aspect of human art. Because, because it is a personal kind of thing, to, for a director to impart their vision to somebody else. And, you know, they're always gonna need to be able to do that. You know, whether it's talking to a composer or whatever. The part of the, the job that I think is shrinking, apart from the fact that people are just making less movies, is that I think more picture editors are editing the sound as they go and kind of tweaking it and, you know, maybe, doing their own kind of aspects of sound design and so forth to render less, need for, sound editors at the other end. I think that would be more the aspect that, you know, where one person is gonna wear many more hats, and whether that's the picture editor or even the sound supervisor, I mean, teams, of people as sound in Soundpost production, have definitely shrunk even in the time that, I mean, I've worked in Los Angeles now for seven years and, you know, I've, I've seen the difference in that time of the size and scale of teams on, on films and so forth. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>So I think it's more that, but I think that'll always be a human face to it. And people always need, you know, there is such a creative element to it, whether it's recording the voices or, you know, and then, you know, there's an opinion base to all of it. You know, there's, there's a, there's a, and that all keeps it quite creative, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3544.92" data-end_ts="3545.16" title="3544.92" id=c_"3544.92">__there__</span>, there's not really any way to automate performance, whether it's a sound design performance, you know, of a non bunch of sounds, or whether it's an actor's performance, you know, you have them coming in again to do it. You know, if you've just got a robot doing that, you know, that's the point where we start going, you know, and is there gonna be a button on the console? It's the performance enhancer, which makes this line now happy and now sad, you know, and we all sort of make, you know, rude jokes about that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>And maybe that will happen Monday day, but it will never replace what is in fact a performance. And even if it's, putting the appropriate sound effects in the background, sure. A program could work out. You could write an algorithm or something that sort of would go, okay, well, you know, like, if a film is something fairly standardized or maybe it's a TV show or a soap opera or one of those sorts of things that comes back to the same locations, maybe you could automate it. So it always comes back to the same sort of backgrounds, you know, oh, okay, it's this location. So you plug in the continuity notes and you can do all that, but you still need to design that to begin with. You still need to come up with what those things are. So I think we've got a bit of creative job security there, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Sure. Well, I think, I think also too, those kind of automated systems will sell, will seldom give you like the leap of creativity that, you know, they might do an adequate job of the most stock version of a thing, but they're never going to, give a surprisingly positive result. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>Yeah. And I think people ultimately, like, you know, I mean, with notable exceptions, of course, but people like to relate to each other and they also like to kind of forge out and or hammer out ideas or tell people ideas. So a director <span style="color:red" data-ts="3653.93" data-end_ts="3654.42" title="3653.93" id=c_"3653.93">__related__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3654.56" data-end_ts="3654.78" title="3654.56" id=c_"3654.56">__to__</span>, or anybody involved in that. And even if you're doing, or you're doing theater or you're doing, anything, you know, where there is a vision and talking to a machine is <laugh> just doesn't have the same ring to it. Yeah, I hear that. And I think that, people are always gonna want to chat to other people. And, you know, and it's a <span style="color:red" data-ts="3677.18" data-end_ts="3677.34" title="3677.18" id=c_"3677.18">__one__</span>, it's such a wonderful experience when you get to work with people who are collaborative and sort of like, interested in a collaborative kind of thing. But it's also a wonderful experience when you've just got somebody really experienced you're working with, they tell you what they want, and you just, you know, make it so number one and off you go, and it's just, and it's marvelous. It's great. So I, I really don't see that disappearing anytime soon. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>All right. Well, that, that is really an awesome way to frame it. And I do think that this sort of like personal interaction thing really is at the heart of what makes great art, no matter what it looks like. Our time is like, well, well up. I really appreciate, spending the, the time with me. I, this has been the evening with Katie and a, glass of wine for me. I had a 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>Glass of wine for me too. Are you kidding? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, awesome 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="3729.28" data-end_ts="3729.57" title="3729.28" id=c_"3729.28">__Name__</span>. Good Lord, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. I appreciate the time and, and your willingness to discuss, all of these things. One final question. There are, there seems to be no end of people who would love to move to LA and get a fabulous job working in the sound part of the movie industry. And, I think that, you know, most people under profession would say, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3759.12" data-end_ts="3759.34" title="3759.12" id=c_"3759.12">__huh__</span>, kid, you know, get a barista job back at home. It's probably more available, right? But, for those people who really do have the drive and desire to do it, what are, what are the mechanisms that can help people pursue a career in this area? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>I'm trying to think of some <span style="color:red" data-ts="3782.64" data-end_ts="3782.86" title="3782.64" id=c_"3782.64">__ca__</span> sort of clever catch phrases, but I can't think of any either. But, so I would say, first of all, perseverance in the face of adversity. And I think also, having an absolute willingness, to start at the bottom and just work your way there and be, you know, con, I wouldn't say content to do so, but not, how do I put this? It takes time to gather the kind of experience in any kind of profession, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3818.6" data-end_ts="3818.82" title="3818.6" id=c_"3818.6">__not__</span> some, you know, there's, these aren't things that, you know, intuitively, they're things that you learn on the job. And the way to learn them on the job is by being, is actually by listening, which ironically is what we do for a living. So it's important to have the right attitude and, and just be willing to put in the time and, and, and really enjoy it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>You know, if you're gonna, I think if you're gonna do something like soundpost production, you really have to love it because you're gonna spend so much time doing it. It's so many hours, it's really late at night. You, it, you know, social life, wee, you know, all those sorts of things. It's, it's really important that, so I think with any job, it's important that you like it enough if you're gonna sacrifice so much for it. And, you know, we can make those choices for better or for worse. And sometimes, you know, we sacrifice things incorrectly, but you have to be willing to want to go that, to go a certain distance with it, you know, however that comes about. And it requires that level of patience where, cause it really could take a long time. And, it is about contacts and, and so forth and impressing people. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>But the people that have quite frankly impressed me the most have just been more about their attitude, their tenacity, and just being fun. People you wanna act, sort of hang out with because in post-production you are stuck with a bunch of people in a room. And that doesn't mean you're supposed to be cool. That just means you know that you can have fun, you can enjoy it. Sure. And you, you, you can get along with other people. So I, I do think that people's skills are, you know, invaluable in, in, in everything. But definitely, you know, when you gotta work with a bunch of people and I think that, cuz you work very closely together, late hours and sometimes you don't smell so good. So, you know, <laugh>, it's, I think it's, yeah, perseverance, a sense of humor, bit of tenacity, and a whole lot of luck. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and, and also what you kind of implied there is doing a whole lot of work. I I always, you know, I have students in, that take classes from me and one of the things I always say is that, no matter what it is that you want to do, do a lot of work. Cuz it's the process of doing a lot of work that actually, makes the contacts, helps you learn how to be social in those situations. And, kind of gives you a reel to be able to work with as well. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>Yeah, it does. And, and it really does. And I think, that's exactly it. I couldn't say it better. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>All right. Well Katie, thank you so much for, this time. It was a fantastic and very interesting conversation. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>No, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3993.06" data-end_ts="3993.18" title="3993.06" id=c_"3993.06">__it__</span> was question. Thank you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I've got this long list of more questions, so maybe we're going to, have another, chat sometime in the future. I would love to dive into the work that you do, a lot of which is dialogue editing, which I probably know almost nothing about. So, we will, plan on doing this again sometime in the near future. But thank you so much for your time and I really appreciate it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>No, thank you. Do, and I was, extremely honored to be in such esteemed company. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>All right, thanks a lot and have a great evening. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Katy: </b>You too. Thanks. Bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And there you have it, another one in the on the bucket. Thanks again to everyone who listened. Well, first of all, thanks to Katie for spending the time. What a great, an interesting discussion and, really her willingness to share about a lot of details is really cool. I want to thank everyone for listening. I want to thank <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_%2774">Cycling '74</a> for giving me the freedom to do this podcast. I want to thank my friends, out at Topia, create digital music and all the other online sites that have been helping to spread the word about the podcast. Really appreciate that folks. And with that, I'm gonna sign off for the week. We will talk to you next time. Looking forward to the next one as well. So have a great one and, do good work this week. Bye.
