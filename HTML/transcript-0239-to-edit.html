<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today I have an opportunity to get to know somebody who's, stuff I've been reading about, listen a little bit, but actually, whose work I've been listening to a lot. I have a tendency with Band <span style="color:red" data-ts="24.345" data-end_ts="24.565" title="24.345" id=c_"24.345">__Kap__</span> to sometimes get on Jags. One of the people in the past that this was like, was with Phil McGuire, I ran across his work and then I couldn't not listen to it for a week. Right? Similarly with this, I ran across it. It was one of those things where I was looking at somebody's site and it was like, people who like this would like that. And I happened to notice it, had a bunch of, it, had a really interesting looking modular on the front end, and I ran across this set of recordings called The Etudes, by to today's guest, Nathan Moody and I was entranced, and I've been listening to it pretty nonstop ever since. So, I'm really glad to get a chance to talk to him, and to find out a little bit more about his work. So, with that, let's say hi to Nathan Moody Hey, Nathan. How's it going? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan Moody: </b>It's going well, man. How about yourself? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>All right. Thanks for taking the time outta your schedule to do this. I really appreciate it. It's, like I said, I've become a little bit obsessed with your music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>If, blurry vision occurs, discontinue use <laugh> <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. So noted <laugh>, why don't we, start off by having you talk a little bit about what your artistic practice is like and, all the things you do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>Well, my, my artistic background is decidedly non-linear. I was trained as an illustrator originally, and I've, I've been painting with oils since I was seven and, started to realize that artistically what I liked were media that were really immediate. Oils are not that <laugh>. So I wound up, becoming an illustrator and really loved the idea of working within constraints that are put upon me as opposed to being just an artist where I would put the restraints <span style="color:red" data-ts="135.245" data-end_ts="135.445" title="135.245" id=c_"135.245">__on__</span>, constraints on upon myself. Okay. And, then that coincided with, getting a job in video and worked in the video industry for a while. Did some editing. That was the first time I used Pro Tools at version two. And then, then I wound up, moving out to the West Coast for work, when CD ROMs were kind of in their heyday. Right. And then from there I did computer journalism and then started to realize that I was actually really, really good at interaction design, and have been doing, interaction design and creative direction for, for a while. And I've been professionally designing, interactive installations for the last 10 years or so. On the music side, I got started in the late nineties. My first sequencer was Metro by Jeremy Sagan. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I remember it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>And, that and deck <span style="color:red" data-ts="193.765" data-end_ts="193.805" title="193.765" id=c_"193.765">__<laugh>__</span> and, you know, I, I didn't have enough, computing power, so I would just basically midi sequence everything and then just cram it all to dat in, in, in a realtime balance. Right. So that was where I really got familiar and conversant with sampling. I'm an old emu guy. And then I had a crisis of confidence one day, and I realized, and I kinda looked at myself in the mirror and I said, you know, you, you're a much better sound designer than a composer. And I had this kind of crisis and I decided, well, maybe I should just really become a sound designer. So I started the Noise Jockey blog, in 2008 and really got into field recording, got into, you know, recontextualized recorded sound. And then, about six to eight years into that, I, again, this is a weird thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>I apparently do get up in the morning, look at myself in the mirror, <laugh>, and I said, there's no difference to me between organizing sound in time for sound design and soundscapes and composition. And when I just kind of had that epiphany, which is kind of silly, the floodgates opened and I've never been more creatively prolific. And so in the last three years I've released 10 Al I will soon have released 10 albums, a number of, compilation appearances and remixes and stuff like that. So I think that kind of catches us up to today. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's, that's a hell of a story, man. <laugh>, I mean, in a way, <laugh>, a good friend of mine, <span style="color:red" data-ts="300.155" data-end_ts="300.445" title="300.155" id=c_"300.155">__kind__</span> of got started by, being a sculptor. And, it's like the opposite. You know, it's like the whole, it's like the long game Right. Being a sculptor. So when you talk about sort of like the immediacy of things, I, I sort of like, compare it against what he was into as a sculptor from an art standpoint. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>That is, that is definitely a different head space for 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. <laugh>. It is. But I'm kind of curious about something. So it sounds to me like in 2008 this, the noy jockey blog, it was kind of started just 'cause you could not necessarily, because you were the most skilled person in the area. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="343.325" data-end_ts="343.445" title="343.325" id=c_"343.325">__A__</span> absolutely. And I think to this day, the header of the site still says it's a, the site is a, is a designer's journey through sound. Okay. And I, I started it just kind of to bring people along for the ride because I, I didn't know anything. Right. I mean, to a certain extent I still don't know anything <laugh>. And since I do so many things, I always do my best to try to be really humble about the, the limits of my knowledge and how, how much I do and don't know. And, and, you know, all of these artistic disciplines are our journeys, and I don't think, I don't think they'll ever be done. And that's why I find them so endlessly Interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm interested in, kind of diving into something here, because one of the things I would say about listening to your albums and like, I, like I just said, I'm, I've been a little obsessed with them lately, is that it's sound designerly, but it also clearly has sort of, it honors the tradition of music without necessarily being stuck in the musical, in musical form. Right. It seems like it combines melodic phrase with drones, with, with noise and with a little bit of sound design all kind of like mashed in together into something that is like really peculiarly interesting to listen to. What are the things that kind of informed you to kind of get there? I mean, do you have a background in any of these areas that is like really deep? Or is it just like light influences that had a big effect? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>I've been playing saxophone since, middle school, I think. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>So I've been playing music for a long time. In fact, I don't know how many of your listeners remember the Texas Instruments TI 99 <laugh>. But, that was my first experience actually programming individual notes, one at a time Tracker style. And I've always loved sound, and I'm one of those kids who had a dual cassette deck and I took stuff off the radio and I made kind of, dadada <span style="color:red" data-ts="469.485" data-end_ts="469.645" title="469.485" id=c_"469.485">__is__</span> collages for my friends. And so I've always been interested in sound and audio. And I think that more contemporary influences really opened my eyes to the I idea. And maybe this was part of the epiphany that I had that brought me back to music that tams can change over time, and that is just as valid a compositional method as melodies changing over time. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>And so I started to, you know, get into Ambien and drone and stuff like that, and I started to realize, oh, there are other ways to move someone through a composition through time that might involve melody, certainly, but it doesn't have to be the only way to to do that. So I think that's where my music has started to kind of have this mix of yes, there's melody and there may or may not be melodic progression over the whole piece, but certainly there's temporal shifts as well. And so I think, using those two techniques has been something that I've been exploring a lot in the last few years. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's interesting too. I mean, I would say that I hear two non-musical influences on you are on your work that end up with a very musical result. First of all, well, not I say non-musical, I mean, not non-electronic musical one, you know, having a background with the saxophone actually does teach you one thing about a melody, which is don't make a melody longer than you can freaking breathe. Right. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>Absolutely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And I think that that's a critical thing. I <span style="color:red" data-ts="562.845" data-end_ts="562.965" title="562.845" id=c_"562.845">__think__</span> I, I grew up as a guitar player and around guitar players, and the thing with guitar players is, is it's really easy to sort of like fall into noodle zone, right? Mm-Hmm. Which is where since you never have to, your fingers never have to breathe, they only have to bleed. <laugh> you got a long time between starting and when you gotta stop. Right, right. Where learning, learning instrumentation, learning with a, with a wind instrument, I think really offers the opportunity of having an almost speech, <span style="color:red" data-ts="597.035" data-end_ts="597.325" title="597.035" id=c_"597.035">__like__</span> patterning to melodies. Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b><affirmative>. Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="601.405" data-end_ts="601.525" title="601.405" id=c_"601.405">__I__</span>, and I, I think that, that, you know, perhaps that might have influenced one of the things that I love about not my own music, but music that I listen to and like listening to is, is contrasts. And when people hear contrast in music, they think loud, quiet, clean, distorted. But for me, the music I like the most is has a lot of temporal contrast in terms of different, different density of notes that either, you know, are, are different per, per layer or component, or that changes over time. And those are the kinds of, compositions that I personally enjoy listening to. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. So when you put together a composition, do you skimm improv it and kind of keep it in your head? Or do you like make like little scores or notes, or how do you prepare yourself for the thing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>A a career of design has caused me to forget how to read music notation <laugh>. Ah. Which I used to be actually <span style="color:red" data-ts="657.565" data-end_ts="657.725" title="657.565" id=c_"657.565">__really__</span>, I was, I got pretty good at <span style="color:red" data-ts="658.965" data-end_ts="659.125" title="658.965" id=c_"658.965">__site__</span> reading when I was younger, but uhhuh, but that's all kind of evaporated a little bit. I have a, I have a Bach score on my desk right now 'cause I'm trying to relearn a lot of that stuff. So like a lot of other artists, I do start most compositions through improvisation. You know, there are other exceptions. Like sometimes there will be a field recording where based on how I set the loop points, a rhythm will evolve. But I tend to just play a lot for my own enjoyment and ideas and notions come out of, come out of that. And what I'll, what I find myself doing a lot recently is, is really improvising more around, well, I should say composing around ous components, like held base notes and chords Mm-Hmm. <span style="color:red" data-ts="711.645" data-end_ts="711.685" title="711.645" id=c_"711.645">__<affirmative>__</span>. And then, set up a framework within which I then improvise to. So it, it goes both ways. But I think that, pretty much everything on the Etude series is a, is a near perfect mix. I think almost every track per track of one or more components are kind of sequenced and they're running on their own. And then what are more other components are things that I'm playing, entirely live and un quantized. <span style="color:red" data-ts="740.555" data-end_ts="740.845" title="740.555" id=c_"740.555">__Yeah__</span>. Yeah. And so that's, that's also kind of how my, my composition process also goes. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I wanna come back to <span style="color:red" data-ts="747.305" data-end_ts="747.525" title="747.305" id=c_"747.305">__it__</span> toos a little bit because, there's a, there's questions that come up because of that. But before we get there, the other thing that I notice in your music that I think might be related to your non-musical interactions is this sense of almost there being like a storytelling. And, and when I hear that you have this <span style="color:red" data-ts="766.555" data-end_ts="766.845" title="766.555" id=c_"766.555">__back__</span>, or you have kind of this gig where you're doing interaction design or you're doing, experience design, you know, for different kinds of things, and I read on your blog the kind of things that you're working with in terms of, presentations, it seems like that involves the timing and cadence of storytelling, but in sort of a more visceral way. Mm-Hmm. And I get that same sense when I listen to your music, that there's an almost visceral version of storytelling going on there. Is it something that you're kind of conscious about? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>It is. It's, it's interesting, interesting that you use the word visceral. <span style="color:red" data-ts="806.885" data-end_ts="807.005" title="806.885" id=c_"806.885">__A__</span> a couple of friends of mine and I were hanging out a few years ago, and when I started to release music again, and they were just kinda like, oh, your music's kind of angry, ambient. And we kind of, hit upon, hit upon the term angry, <span style="color:red" data-ts="821.425" data-end_ts="821.645" title="821.425" id=c_"821.425">__and__</span> which <laugh> got us all laughing. And, for some reason now it's a hashtag, so that's great. So I'm basically, I'm basically, too old to be a punk and too angry to be a hippie. And I, I use music to deal with all of that <laugh>. And, but, you know, to the narrative side of things, that is very much something that I do try to attempt, on in all of my releases. And, and frankly, it's because A, I love story B I'm also a huge fan of minimalist writers, and I love people like Raymond Carver who will tell a story and you literally have to read the story two or three times to penetrate into that lower layer about, oh, this is what they were talking about. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>And that epiphany you have to kind of work for that is just so, so satisfying. And so what I try to do, I'm not, I'm not the one to say whether it's successful or not, is to try to have a, a narrative framework at play, because I'm also a huge fan of the album. Mm-Hmm. <span style="color:red" data-ts="889.925" data-end_ts="889.965" title="889.925" id=c_"889.925">__<affirmative>__</span> and the continuous listening experience. Right. But not to spoonfeed the listeners so much. Maybe lead them down a certain path with things like track names. Especially since I'm a, I'm a <span style="color:red" data-ts="904.465" data-end_ts="904.685" title="904.465" id=c_"904.465">__in__</span> instrumentalist. I don't have vocals or lyrics in my music. And then kind of see where the listener will take it. And to me, that's the best thing. That's the thing that I love about interaction design. That's also the thing I love about abstract art. You know, you have to meet it halfway to complete the piece. And that's what I inherently love about music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That is a fantastic point. And and it's something I think that, that a lot of times, especially electronic musicians aren't paying attention to it, it tends to be something you do more if you are an acoustic musician, one of these things of drawing people in and playing with that push and pull between the listener and the performer. Right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> with electronics, we have the opportunity to make all the noise and we can make it as freaking loud as we want. Right. And so we have the opportunity to pumble the listener with our, with our great vision, and oftentimes we do. Right. <laugh>. And so this idea of actually taking the opportunity to draw people in, in a, <span style="color:red" data-ts="976.505" data-end_ts="976.725" title="976.505" id=c_"976.505">__in__</span>, again, in, in a <span style="color:red" data-ts="977.765" data-end_ts="978.085" title="977.765" id=c_"977.765">__store__</span> story-like fashion seems to me to be kind of an art form that needs to be redeveloped. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>I agree. And I, I think that you, you see some people, well, one of the things that I like about narrative too is that it can be non-linear, like films like Pulp Fiction Right. Are a great example of that kind of in the gestalt pop culture kind of sense. But then you have people who are just telling stories where maybe it's not a narrative, but it's incredibly personal. Like, Alessandro Cortini Avanti album, you know? Right. If he's basically scoring his own childhood and it's, it's abstract and it doesn't spoon feed things to you, but just the emotion that that is laden in that music is just really self-evident. And I think it's a, a very powerful result. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Before I go on, I have to ask, I'm a big book <span style="color:red" data-ts="1029.605" data-end_ts="1029.845" title="1029.605" id=c_"1029.605">__head__</span>, right? And so this idea of minimalist writers has got my interest peaked. Who was the, the author that you mentioned? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>Raymond Carver. Raymond Carver. And he, he's probably best known for a collection of short stories he wrote called What We Talk About When We Talk About Love. And just even that title really gets to the heart of what I love about minimalist writing is that, is that, you know, when we talk about things, what is said is nowhere near as important as the subtext of what is, is meant. And that is just, itself as a title. You have to read that two or three times again to kind of get, you know, penetrate that layer of meeting that the, that the, the artist is intending. Right. And, you know, I think that's why I, I really like music that is actually, instrumental. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Because unless you're someone like Radiohead with extremely poetic abstract, lyrics that do have meaning, but you have to parse that, you know, over repeated listen listens quite often, instrumental music is inherently really good at setting a mood that draws you in, but sometimes you have to listen to it a few times to bring your own opinion to bear as to what the song is, is about, if anything. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Instrumental music does seem to leave a little bit on the table right in, in that there is this whole, there is this whole verbal thing that's left kind of untouched, and sometimes I think unfortunately untouched, although I have to admit, and just recently somebody sent me what I can Clearly claim is a beautiful album, but it's an album of electronic music that has lyrics and I couldn't deal with it. There was, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. There was something about it that it almost like violated some sense of, when I, when I hear this context, I expect this kind of result, or I expect this kind of storytelling and having lyrics somehow violated that. For me, <laugh> it was, it was a very weird experience because otherwise I would've, by every measure, it would've been something I would've loved. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>Well, that's really interesting. But did, did the lyrics serve to make your attention operate <span style="color:red" data-ts="1179.205" data-end_ts="1179.365" title="1179.205" id=c_"1179.205">__at__</span>, at a different level, perhaps, where you were trying to focus on one thing and it was drawing you elsewhere? What, what do you think was at play there? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I think that it made something too literal for me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Hmm. You know, I, I think maybe what I do like about electronic music is that if I decide today that it's about robots, and if tomorrow I decide about it's about grasshoppers, I'm free to do that. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and the second words are put to it, then now I have lost the opportunity to name it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>Yep, exactly. And you know, it's funny that you mention that because the only music that I listen to at home with lyrics is in different languages that I don't understand. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. That is amazing. So I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>Like, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What are examples? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>The Cocteau twins Dead <span style="color:red" data-ts="1229.665" data-end_ts="1229.885" title="1229.665" id=c_"1229.665">__Can__</span> Dance. I listen to a lot of, Turkish psychedelic rock, which is cool because the American psych rock scene in the seventies borrowed a ton from the, from, you know, middle Eastern and Indian traditions. But it went the other way too. It comes 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Around, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>Right. Yeah. So there <span style="color:red" data-ts="1248.605" data-end_ts="1248.685" title="1248.605" id=c_"1248.605">__are__</span> all these, you know, 1970s Turkish bands who absolutely worshiped Led Zeppelin, <laugh>, you know, and, and it's, and a lot of people don't realize that it went both ways. And I love that stuff. Brazilian music, there's so much soul and love in Brazilian music, but I don't know the, what the lyrics are, frankly. So that's the only kind of music I can actually bear to listen to, with, with lyrics is literally lyrics that I don't understand. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's, that's interesting. Yeah. Well, I, I can completely understand that as well. Let's talk a little bit about your, about this group of albums that you've put out. It's, it's a pretty amazing set of work, especially over a relatively short period of time. But I want to talk specifically about this one group called the, that you have labeled the Etudes, which <span style="color:red" data-ts="1299.385" data-end_ts="1299.605" title="1299.385" id=c_"1299.385">__it__</span> are based around a specific instrument that you created for now. Did you use that instrument? The, the one that's on the cover? Is that the one that's used throughout the, throughout the album? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>That's correct, yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. One of the things I would say, so there's three of 'em. One, the last one I think is called the Red Box. And then there was the white box. And the blue box was the first, each one of them, the, the blue box, if I recall right, is like an Intelli case with one of the touch keyboards by, the guy that's not doing it anymore, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>By Sputnik. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sputnik, that's the one. Yep. And, and then just a, a variety of, a combination of Sputnik and Intelli stuff, is that correct? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>It was mostly Sputnik and mannequins. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Mannequins, okay. Alright. Yeah, that makes sense. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>And then the red box was, mostly 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Right. And then the white and the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1358.965" data-end_ts="1359.005" title="1358.965" id=c_"1358.965">__white__</span> box, white white box was an op one, right? Yep. Yep. Yeah. Okay. I found those amazing for, because each one of 'em seemed to honor the core of what it was that that box was. So like in the blue box one, there was clearly an engagement with the touch keyboard thing, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> that interacting with that was clearly a significant part of what you were doing, you know, likewise, in the, the red box thing, the multi-stage sequencer thing seemed to come into play an awful lot, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And then in the white box, sort of like the tweezing sound core, but also the really peculiar effects of the, of the OP one, were really upfront. Now what's funny is in all of these cases, they all still sound very much like all your other work and, and, you know, so I would say it sounds like you, right. What is it that you brought to that, and what is it that the instrument brought to you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>Well, you don't go light on the questions, do you? <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>? No, no. It's like, yeah, I'm this just, just this side of going to church. So <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>Well, I'll, I'll testify, I'll testify 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Okay, then. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>So, that's, that's a really interesting and, and actually pretty challenging question to answer. I think they all sound like me because I chose to buy those modules and arrange them in those ways. I chose the, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1462.525" data-end_ts="1462.685" title="1462.525" id=c_"1462.525">__op__</span> one as an instrument to explore, because they were all created, I think within a calendar year of one another, I was probably in a pretty consistent emotional headspace. And so I think that's, those might be reasons why there's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1481.505" data-end_ts="1481.725" title="1481.505" id=c_"1481.505">__the__</span>, there's kind of a consistent voice, behind the actual, you know, instruments used. And I think that the blue box <span style="color:red" data-ts="1490.945" data-end_ts="1491.165" title="1490.945" id=c_"1490.945">__and__</span>, really, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1491.925" data-end_ts="1492.205" title="1491.925" id=c_"1491.925">__which__</span>, which started the whole thing was really me exploring what I mentioned I loved about illustration, actually, which is, let me, let me put some arbitra actually. Yeah. For that one, I just said, you know what, this is going to be an arbitrary constraint. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>I've never made an entire track with just two rows of modular. And that's mostly because at that time, I didn't have the skills to do so, actually. And of course, as, as one gets better in any sort of craft, the fewer and fewer tools you actually need. So, it was a learning experience for me, and I started just doing these sketches on this instrument that I built with the intent that it was going to, you know, that's gonna sit next to my other modular and it's just an instrument on its own, and it will play some parts in some larger composition. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And then I started to realize that having so few modules, I needed to learn each one of them at like a mastery level to, to get the results I wanted. Right. And then all of a sudden I'm like, oh, I'm, I'm making full tracks with this and I don't, maybe I don't need anything else for, to, to express these ideas. And so, after that I kind of looked around my studio and like, well, the op one is an extremely limit filled box despite <span style="color:red" data-ts="1571.085" data-end_ts="1571.165" title="1571.085" id=c_"1571.085">__<laugh>__</span>, despite how, how flexible it can be. Right? Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>Yes. You know, and then, and then the red box was just basically a stopover between the Blue box and Ula <laugh>. Right, right. Where I'm, I'm kind of spending a lot of my time now, so 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, I noticed that. Like, you're, what's nice is that on your site you put like production notes, which are kind of a discussion of like, you know, it's almost like a behind the scenes sort of a thing about the creation of each album. And it seems like this last album specifically was, or the last two albums were really focused on ULA easel as sort of the the end tool, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>Yeah. In a way, I think that, you know, and all that started with the Blue box, because of course, almost all of the Sputnik modules are just, Eurorack versions of Buchla modules, right. For, for all intents and purposes. Right. And then all of verbose modules are at least inspired by Buchla modules, and then he takes them in a slightly different or slightly expanded route. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and I started, started having these experiences with this kind of more, you know, quote unquote West Coast, you know, ula kinda mindset in terms of workflow, several albums down the road. And I started to realize, you know, I, I get the Headspace and it really speaks to me creatively, but I'm not getting the tams, it doesn't. Right. You know, it, it's, it's a esque process, but it doesn't sound like the Buchla. And of course it doesn't have to, that's not the point. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>But then I realized, well, the, the one frontier I haven't crossed in this style of synthesis is actually using an actual ula. So I, I got, I decided to sell a mountain of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1677.845" data-end_ts="1678.045" title="1677.845" id=c_"1677.845">__your__</span> Iraq <laugh> and, bought, I, I think I bought the very last Bookla 2 0 8 that Adam, Django's Fire Scrams <span style="color:red" data-ts="1688.525" data-end_ts="1688.685" title="1688.525" id=c_"1688.525">__dad__</span>, built before he, he took a break from, from building. Right. And, and I just had the 2 0 8 for a long time, no other modules at all, and I was having the best time. And so I don't, I'm, I'm never gonna turn my back on <span style="color:red" data-ts="1703.965" data-end_ts="1704.165" title="1703.965" id=c_"1703.965">__your__</span> rack because it's small. It's cost effective for modular of course. And available. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>And, and super available. But having, having both flavors and the right modules to connect them together, into a larger, a larger cohesive <span style="color:red" data-ts="1720.375" data-end_ts="1720.725" title="1720.375" id=c_"1720.375">__whole__</span>, I do find really, really inspiring. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So you sold a mountain of stuff, but I mean, if somebody said, Hey, I want red box, part two, do you still even have those, that pile laying around? Or is that long gone? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>That's a, it's a funny question. The red box configuration is no more. I sold a lot of those modules, but now the red box is in a, four row suitcase. So it's, it's, it's still around. It just got bigger. Oh, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's going the wrong way, man. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>I know, I know 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>But, but the blue box literally has not changed. Not a module swap, not a, not a case reorg, nothing like that has Oh, that's funny. Absolutely not changed. So for me, that's a really stable, instrument. And, and because it <span style="color:red" data-ts="1776.645" data-end_ts="1776.805" title="1776.645" id=c_"1776.645">__has__</span>, it's my only modular that actually has a keyboard, it's actually my most, immediate modular system in, in my studio. So I still go back to that and noodle on it and get ideas. And sometimes I'll continue with those ideas on it. Sometimes I'll transfer it to another system. So Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and the fact that it's, it's stayed in a stable configuration kind of means it has sort of like stabilized itself into kind of instrument zone, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>Yeah, yeah, exactly. You know, it, it, it took the modular format to create it <laugh>. Right. But the modular format is not causing me to rethink it. Right. And it's the first configuration of a, of a modular that I've ever had where I've, where I've, I've felt confident in doing that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Now, one of the things that, when I, when I did a little sniffing around, you are, you know, getting back to this idea of being an expert generalist. I mean, you talk about your experiences doing sound design, about doing graphic design, about doing, sound, you know, interaction, design, sound for film, all field recording, all these different things. You have this like real generalist, thing. But one of the things that I do notice is that graphic design plays a significant role in practically everything you do, because you always have sort of like a very, I don't know, a, a very, focused and, and very clean, great visual look to the stuff that you do. One thing I'm curious about, though, as a designer and as a designer of things, how temp aren't you tempted to do more physical releases of your music rather than just digital releases on Bandcamp 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>In general? Absolutely. Yes. I'm of the age where, you know, I like to listen to albums. I've always liked having the physical artifact, something to look at while I actively listen to someone's body of work. And so that's always on my mind when I think about releasing my work and, and having design, and imagery to support it. For the last two albums, though, even though I can do all of this stuff myself, my last two albums, I've engaged someone else to do the album art and packaging, and it has been such a wonderful collaboration. <laugh>, the guy I'm working with is a artist and actually a modular head called, Cory Holmes. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1940.795" data-end_ts="1941.085" title="1940.795" id=c_"1940.795">__Cory__</span> is, one of the best graphic designers I've ever worked with, and I've hired my <span style="color:red" data-ts="1946.215" data-end_ts="1946.565" title="1946.215" id=c_"1946.215">__share__</span> over my career. There's something just so wonderful about someone else reinterpreting your work and it not just being feedback on an album, it being, it manifesting in something visual, and sometimes he'll go really orthogonal with, with the work, even though, you know, I explain all the, all the themes and everything, and it's very on theme and it's on brand and all this other thing, all this other stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>But it's that, it's that unexpected element of someone else interpreting your work, which is why people are in bands and why authors have have editors. And so for me, starting to kind of loosen the reigns and give some of that responsibility to somebody else is, I wouldn't say liberating, but it's certainly creatively really, really inspiring, and it forces me to be better at that when I do it myself. So. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That makes a lot of sense. Now, do you ever collaborate on the musical side of stuff? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>That's a great question. I've certainly gotten my share of requests, and I think that a lot of musicians want to collaborate, and the gears will kind of be set in motion. But I think what kills a lot of collaboration between otherwise solo artists is lack of a framework for how, and this is not a problem in a traditional band because each person has an instrument, and that is their role in the band. The drummer might be the, the songwriter, or it might be the bassist, but when it comes to performing, each person has their role. And I think that I've found that, and this may be a personal feeling of mine creatively, I need a framework of what roles we might play. And that narrows the possibility space enough that I don't have the blank canvas problem of, of how, how to even get started or how to proceed. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>I've certainly done my share of remixes. That's a framework for kind of collaborating with, with somebody. But my friend and, who's local to the Bay Area, and he's, he's very well known in the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2080.565" data-end_ts="2081.085" title="2080.565" id=c_"2080.565">__eurorack__</span> world. James Sigler, when James plays live, he plays with basically a drummer who is using a modular. And so the division of roles there is really, really clear. And the, the audio results are great because <span style="color:red" data-ts="2095.375" data-end_ts="2095.725" title="2095.375" id=c_"2095.375">__there__</span>, that guy's working just on rhythm, and James is working on everything else. So I think for me, I would need to find collaborators who would say, okay, let's, let's come up with some rules of engagement. Let's put a framework around it. And then I think that's, that's where I, I tend to be a lot more comfortable. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So in trying this, in the past, have you never felt free to just tell somebody to be like, Hey, be the bass player today, or <laugh>, I'll be the bass player today? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>I find a lot of musicians actually a little resistant to Oh, really? To such, and, and I'm not, this isn't a generalization, this is based on my personal experience, of course. Sure, sure. I've found that some musicians are, are pretty resistant to that. And I think it's because they don't want it to feel like work 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>And, you know, who can blame them. Right. Like, I totally get that, but I, I look at this as, you know, I'm, I'm lucky enough to basically be paid to do pretty close to what I was trained to do in college and art school. Right. And that's really, really rare. So for me, what is professional and what is personal is ultra ultra blurry. Ah, okay. Right. And so for me, like it's those kinds of, it, it's all about expectation management, and this is what I found in work and personal relationships, in the music industry, it is all about setting expectations. And it's the only time anyone ever gets angry with anybody is when their expectations are violated. Right. And, and so for me, that's, that's how I have, that's my safety net going into a collaborative project, is to have that a little bit more figured out. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, as you mentioned, you live in the Bay Area, which has its pros and it has its cons. I mean, some of its pros are that I, I mean, the, the spirit of ULA is in the air. Right. And, and the spirit of an awful lot of creativity is in the air there, or, or at least it used to be. My experience of San Francisco lately hasn't been great. And, I'm just wondering, what, what is your feelings about what's happening to the city? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>I think that a lot of our current challenges that we're facing in the Bay Area is basically in equal distribution of wealth, uhhuh <affirmative>. And it is largely around privileged people being given privileged people's money to solve privileged people's problems. And until there's a cycle that will break where the, where and from whom venture capital is coming, I don't see any, any change in that anytime soon. Hmm. You know, we're just starting to see the chinks in the armor of the, the Facebooks and the Twitters of the world, vis-a-vis data privacy, the whole not being sure what the information source is, right. That you're reading and where's where it's coming from. Because, you know, when you create this stuff in your dorm room, no one ever thinks that it's actually gonna become like the newspaper of the future. Right. So just like any piece of science fiction, we are dealing with the unintended consequences of technology. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>And, you know, it's, it's interesting living here, and I've lived here for over two decades, and having friends come in to, large scale events like the Game Developers Conference and year on year saying that, you know, more and more they are scared to walk down the street, it's a little bit sketchy, you know, and some places it's a whole lot sketchy. And a lot of that is because someone comes in from out of town, all the affordable hotels are in the really, really, really sketchy areas. Right. So, you know, I I really try to be an optimist that I, I get through life with a smile on my face every day, really, truly believing that people at their core are inherently good, but living in the Bay Area, tests that every single day, <laugh>. And I also really think that at this point, short of a earthquake, a big one Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>I'm not sure what's gonna possibly, or the, the tech economy tanking. It's not gonna get cheaper anytime soon. But, you know, it's, it's easy to sit here and hate on the tech industry. It's easy to point fingers, but I'm actually leaving, or largely leaving the tech industry after having worked in it for 15, 20 years. And so, you know, I have to always look at myself and say, how culpable am I in? Right. The clients that I've taken on. And so, luckily, I, I have not really done a huge material amount of work on, I've actually done no work on social media in my career, which makes me feel a little bit better about it. But it's like any other thing in human existence, it's complex, it's nuanced, and we all hope it sure could be better. And I think it's, it's incumbent upon all of us to look at what situations we are in now and just kind of, you know, really be honest about every decision we make are are we helping or are we hurting? And be ready to kind of pull the plug and take some personal sacrifice and pain in order to make the right decision sometimes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, and on a more practical level though, too, some of the things that you're seeing in, in terms of the unequal distribution of wealth and the, the support of a privileged class has, kind of immediate effect on you as an artist and just a creative person. I mean, one of the things you mentioned in one of your blog posts is that, Hey, I spent an enormous amount of time commuting. Right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And so I've had to find a way to mitigate that commute time by making it creative time. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, how sustainable is that? And how, how is it, is it possible for it to get worse? And if so, at what point does it stop getting to be a place of creativity? Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>Well, I think that what keeps I, and this is my personal opinion, I, I think what keeps communities creative is youth. And when you can get youth injected into a community, this is why, you know, people really, really like living in college towns. And that is one of the, silver linings of the tech industry is that it does attract a lot of really, really smart, talented young people. The challenge, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2488.345" data-end_ts="2488.565" title="2488.345" id=c_"2488.345">__it__</span>, it's almost like the San Francisco is like the game industry <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>It attracts the brightest, most innovative people and then burns them out and they leave before they can make their most important contribution. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>And so no one who comes to San Francisco can stay there once they wanna start a family. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>What happens, you get people leaving the Bay Area, but again, to your point, you know, a slight silver lining, a lot of those people go to Oakland Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And now Oakland is kind of the center for creativity. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2522.365" data-end_ts="2522.565" title="2522.365" id=c_"2522.365">__Yeah__</span>. Because it's a lot less expensive. Yep. Again, relatively speaking, that in and of itself creates gentrification problems and other kinds of challenges. But the East Bay is a lot more culturally and ethnically diverse than San Francisco is. And it's where I, it's where I spend most of my leisure time hanging out, frankly. There are always pros and cons to situations like that, but I think that <span style="color:red" data-ts="2542.585" data-end_ts="2542.805" title="2542.585" id=c_"2542.585">__it__</span>, if, if a community starts losing relatively young people because they can't afford it or because they wanna start a family and they don't perceive it's the right place to do that, that's where you really start to get <span style="color:red" data-ts="2555.285" data-end_ts="2555.485" title="2555.285" id=c_"2555.285">__in__</span> kind of creative, creative hardening of the arteries. Right. And that's when, that's when communities really need to, to perk up and say, Hmm, is this the direction we want to go in? Sure. Up 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Their game a little bit. Right. Yeah. Very interesting. And sorry to take you off on a, on a Bay Area diversion, but it's, it's, it's a place of great change, but one where so much of what we think of in terms of electronic music had had a very much either a birth or a good adolescence right there, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>Absolutely. Oh, absolutely. It's an important 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Place. Absolutely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>It is. And, and still, you know, to this day, there's people like, Danny Kim down in the South Bay, who <span style="color:red" data-ts="2595.965" data-end_ts="2596.165" title="2595.965" id=c_"2595.965">__is__</span> behind the Binary Society series of events. There are at least I think, two electronic music open mic nights now in the Bay Area. And so, and there's robot speak the local, synth shop. So there are at least some places hanging on that might not even be traditional venues, but there are places you can still go and hear, you know, all different kinds of electronic music, all different kinds of music of all kinds. I think a lot of us really still like being the shrews amongst the dinosaurs, <laugh>, you know, you know, and trying to keep creativity flowing in. Right. Non-commercial, non-traditional ways, even amongst, you know, being at the toes of some of the biggest tech titans in the, in the world. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Well, our time has blown by amusingly <laugh>. But before I let you go, I'm curious, can you give us a little hint about what might be around the corner from you from a, production standpoint? You got any, got any music or got any artwork that that's, you're fixing <span style="color:red" data-ts="2661.225" data-end_ts="2661.445" title="2661.225" id=c_"2661.225">__to__</span> drop that you wanna talk about? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>I can provide some foreshadowing, perhaps. I've been teasing a little bit on social media over the last couple of months that I've got a new release coming up. It's going to be very different and there will be no synthesizers on it of any kind. And what makes it even more interesting is that it will also be accompanied by a number of other products that people can actually buy and use that are related to that album. So that's gonna probably all happen in the first half of September. And so that's been really, really fun and a great, great personal challenge. And again, it's forced me to collaborate more with a broader range of people, which as a solo artist, I, I, I find endlessly inspiring. I'm also going to be playing probably multiple, multiple show dates in Germany of all places in October. So if any of your listeners are in Germany, pay attention to, social media and I'll make some show announcements about that. And then Fantastic. Yeah. And then in, early August, actually in <span style="color:red" data-ts="2727.805" data-end_ts="2727.925" title="2727.805" id=c_"2727.805">__a__</span> less than a couple of weeks now, I'll be doing an experimental, live a live experimental techno set at a, synth meet in Salt Lake City. And I haven't been to Salt Lake in a very long time, so I'm really looking forward to hanging out with folks there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that sounds like <span style="color:red" data-ts="2743.045" data-end_ts="2743.165" title="2743.045" id=c_"2743.045">__a__</span> quite a, quite a menu <laugh>, fantastic. I'm really looking forward to seeing what comes out of this thing in September, but also, getting, getting a chance to get out and playing live. That's, that's just always a blast. Well, I want to thank you again for your time. I wish I still have, I wish we could have talked more about like, field recording and stuff, but we'll have to do it another time in the, in the meantime, I wanna thank you so much for your time and, have a great night. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nathan: </b>This has been such a pleasure, Darwin. Thank you so much. All right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Bye.
