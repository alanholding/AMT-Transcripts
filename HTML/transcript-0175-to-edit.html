<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today I have the great pleasure of getting to meet somebody whose work I've known for a little while. And, someone that my friend Tom Hall turned me onto. His name's Lawrence English a fantastic musician, a composer, recording artist, a label runner. An artist does physical artworks as well, and a writer and all kinds of stuff. So rather than having me tell his story, let's ask Lawrence to tell us a little bit about himself. Hi, Lawrence. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence English: </b>Good, <span style="color:red" data-ts="46.445" data-end_ts="46.605" title="46.445" id=c_"46.445">__Dawn__</span>. How are you going? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm great. Thanks a lot for joining us on, on the podcast here. Could we kick it off by having you explain a little bit or tell us a little bit about some of the work you've done recently? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>Yeah, sure. I mean, but just that introduction kind of makes, I'm reminded of, I used to have this phrase about a commitment to overcommitment, and apparently that still seems to be the case, right? So, I don't know whether that's a healthy thing to maintain. I think I probably am trying to maintain less of that approach, as I, you know, mature. There was definitely a period or that, and there probably are still periods where I'd maintain this idea of a, a sort of commitment to overcommitment <laugh>. Right, right. Yeah. The, the last few, I mean, the, probably the last year's been quite, actually, it's been incredibly busy to be totally frank. Keeping with the, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="91.185" data-end_ts="91.405" title="91.185" id=c_"91.185">__pH__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="91.405" data-end_ts="91.565" title="91.405" id=c_"91.405">__phrase__</span>, I've been working a lot <span style="color:red" data-ts="93.145" data-end_ts="93.365" title="93.145" id=c_"93.145">__on__</span>, on a couple of different projects, partly on some large scale sculptural installation works that are going to be presented mid-year. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>This year, I, I finished the cruel optimism record at <span style="color:red" data-ts="103.345" data-end_ts="103.565" title="103.345" id=c_"103.345">__the__</span>, sort of towards the end of last year, and then that came out at the beginning of this year. At the same time, I've been doing a lot of research around listening and finishing up my PhD thesis essentially, which has been kind of building this theoretical framework to approach listening as it sort of pertains to, to practices like field recording, which for me are kind of under theorized. We don't necessarily understand or have ways to talk about the processes that happen while, while that occurs. So that's taken up a lot of time as a sort of side result of both of those. There have been a couple of writing projects like this piece I did on the Sound of Fear, looking at the weaponization of sound across the 20th century into the 21st century. So there's been these interweaving threads that kind of lie between some of the research work, but then also some of the, the sort of practical creative music making work or, or art practice as well. So it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="156.245" data-end_ts="156.325" title="156.245" id=c_"156.245">__a__</span>, it's been interesting in that regard that things have sort of woven together in a way that, to be frank, they don't always do that, but just recently there's been enough kind of crossover that that has occurred. It's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Cool that you can, I mean, in a way, academics plus recording and live work plus doing sculptural artwork, those have the potential for being three pretty widely divergent activities, right? Yeah. What, what is it for you that is pulling them all together? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>Look, I tell you, I like ideas essentially. That's really what it comes down to. And it's interesting when I think about all of the ways that I approach those, I don't actually often think about it in terms of the academy. I mean, I, I guess the PhD is housed within the structure that is the Academy. But to be honest, I'm much more of the <span style="color:red" data-ts="202.045" data-end_ts="202.285" title="202.045" id=c_"202.045">__Stuart__</span> Hall, school of Thinking, which is, you know, basically about this idea of, <span style="color:red" data-ts="207.665" data-end_ts="207.885" title="207.665" id=c_"207.665">__or__</span> he describes as being a public intellectual. And I think that's part of the thing. I think the, the conversation needs to be in the public sphere. The way that the academy kind of cloisters knowledge, or at least cloisters information, I think is really detrimental to things moving forward. And what's been fantastic, particularly in an area like Sound Studies, for example, is so many people have come to this area in the last sort of 10 or 15 years and have really enriched the conversation because they're having in a public sphere, these, the books are being published by major publishers, which means that, of course, you know, a whole bunch of people can come in contact with them and begin to think about what it is that it might mean for them to, you know, if we're talking about sound, what their, what their audition means, what it is for them to engage with sound. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>And, and suddenly the practice becomes richer because of that. I mean, there's that great Ian quote, which is, you know, discourse is, <span style="color:red" data-ts="257.985" data-end_ts="258.205" title="257.985" id=c_"257.985">__or__</span> the short version is discourse <span style="color:red" data-ts="259.645" data-end_ts="259.845" title="259.645" id=c_"259.645">__is__</span> systemically formed, the objects of which they speak Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So, you know, which basically means if we can describe it and talk about it, eventually that thing is formed. And I think that's what we've really been lacking in something like sound, is the ability to really describe and, and critically analyze and talk about the, the sort of phenomenological implications, but also the kind of theoretical practical ones as well for how it is that we, we do what we do. Yeah. It's a, it's an interesting time in that regard. I think we're really kind of resolving around that, and you can see the work reflecting that thing. So for me, it's this idea of, of really how they weave together is, is about that kind of conceptual framework. Everything sort of weaves together. I'm not one of these people that can make music out of nothing. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I really respect people that can just make a record, and it's, that's, it's just, it's songs or whatever it is. That's just not how I operate. So for me, it's very much about bringing these things together and contextualizing the ideas. And from that, I guess, kind of cultivating what it might mean to manifest that in sound or in music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You know, it, it's interesting you say that about respecting people who can make stuff up out of nothing, but there seems to be this sense where people never want to talk about the intellectual pursuits of creativity. Right. Sometimes we need to have something to kind of trip our trigger or wet our appetite for creation. Right. And I think sometimes intellectual pursuits can provide that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>Oh, definitely. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, look, I can speak personally to the whole reason that cruel optimism exists. And in fact, the whole reason that Cruel Optimism is named that it comes on the back of this book by Lauren <span style="color:red" data-ts="359.965" data-end_ts="360.205" title="359.965" id=c_"359.965">__Burn__</span> the American Critical Theorist. I mean, her writing for me was incredibly provocative and, and powerful, and it helped situate the overarching themes or questions that I had that were, that were much more based in a kind of like societal, cultural, political context. How it was that I could translate those into some sort of meaningful sonic engagement. And, you know, very early on, as cruel optimism was taking shape, I wrote to her and said, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="387.925" data-end_ts="388.245" title="387.925" id=c_"387.925">__would__</span> basically, this is the process that's happened with this record, and, you know, I'm really a huge fan and, have a great deal of respect for the work, and it's been incredibly important for how it <span style="color:red" data-ts="398.605" data-end_ts="398.685" title="398.605" id=c_"398.605">__is__</span> the records taken shape. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>How would you feel about me calling the album Cruel Optimism? She, you know, very kindly wrote back and said, look, I'm very interested to see how these things are seeded and, and where they go. And so I'm very open to that idea. But that was, it was a real clincher for me to be like, okay, well this is, this is how these things really, you know, maybe they run in parallel for a while, but eventually there's this kind of crossover where they, the, the parallel lines bend and break away. Right. And there can be a very direct tactile kind of engagement there between theory. But, you know, theory was always kind of about the application, its <span style="color:red" data-ts="435.645" data-end_ts="435.845" title="435.645" id=c_"435.645">__values__</span> in the application towards certain kinds of things. And I found <span style="color:red" data-ts="438.275" data-end_ts="438.765" title="438.275" id=c_"438.275">__someone__</span> like Lauren ER's writing to be in incredibly relevant, and as a great tool for kind of decoding what's happening, all around the world. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>You know, obviously you guys have some, some very curious, depressing, confrontational times right now, <laugh>, and it's, you're not alone. You know, we, we, we, we face the same thing here in, in France, in, in Sweden. There are a whole bunch in the uk there's a whole bunch of these, countries right now that are, that are really struggling with, questions of identity and, and value of their citizens. You know, I, I was really interested in that. I was also very interested in this, you know, the question of the idea of refugee and territoriality and what that means, today. And because there's just so much, it's so present, particularly for us here, we've had a really horrific engagement with refugee populations where, going back to that idea of <span style="color:red" data-ts="490.525" data-end_ts="490.685" title="490.525" id=c_"490.525">__<inaudible>__</span>, the, the discourse is systemically formed <span style="color:red" data-ts="492.325" data-end_ts="492.485" title="492.325" id=c_"492.325">__with__</span> the objects of which they speak. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>You know, there was these moments where we, we took away their ability to be seen as refugees by changing the discourse. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And it was amazing to watch that happen at a kind of policy level within the government, and then within a few months at a media level, and then just people, beginning to, become enculturated in the way that those, individuals are described. So they had moved from being refugees to being illegal immigrants, and there was this idea of threat that somehow came with this thing. And it was extraordinary to, to watch it happen and to watch it be so quickly taken up. And I think that was something that really made me very aware of how we need to have these conversations. That kind of idea of, like you say, the intellectual pursuit. I mean, that's an important, and for me, and in fact, a critical function of art practice and, for making, you know, music as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>I, I, I really feel, particularly with music, we've kind of, in some respects, I, I think there are lots of groups that don't, don't fall into this category, or artists that don't fall into this category, but we've kind of subdued, the capacity for the work to really articulate to towards bigger questions and things. And I mean, that's partly to do with the fact that, you know, in the mid 20th century, the music music shifted out being part of the fine arts into being, a kind of economic, like an an an industry, right? An entertainment industry. And there's nothing wrong with music being entertaining. In fact, you know, it should be entertaining, but there's a problem, if it's purely entertainment and spectacle and it doesn't have any kind of greater resonance. That's just that, that's what it becomes. This idea of the, you know, the seven inch single, the disposable music that's turned over week to week. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, it's kind of like, cotton candy. It's really pleasurable to eat it, but eventually it rots your teeth. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>To what extent is there also some issues just with the way that we, the, the music that we're, we're making, I mean, the folk music world and the rock world of the sixties and seventies, because there was, you know, there were vocals that could easily spell out a message for people listening the first time. Were very a, were very easily able to convey, protest, or convey political ideas or, you know, have, have some sort of means to interact in that kind of way. Now, there's, you know, and not to put too fine a point on it, but sometimes we now have music where the engagement is on <span style="color:red" data-ts="648.965" data-end_ts="649.085" title="648.965" id=c_"648.965">__the__</span> level of, wow, I wonder what module was used to make that <laugh>. I wonder what effect was used to <span style="color:red" data-ts="654.645" data-end_ts="654.805" title="654.645" id=c_"654.645">__make__</span>, make that, I wonder, I wonder if this would go over at my local club. You know, I wonder if serum preset does that, you know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>It's, it's the crisis of production pornography. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. <laugh>, right. And, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>Yeah, no, I think that, look, it's a really interesting question, and I, I, I mean, I, I don't, I think there's a couple of different levels to it. That period in the sixties and seventies, I mean, was the first time where I guess there was a, a consciousness, or at least an ability for people to recognize that there was this, vehicle that they could use for, for getting information out. It was a particularly didactic way to approach it. And I think at the time that really worked, because the complexity of the media environment now is so radically different to what it was then, you know, that you had these incredible cultural gatekeepers, and you had these large scale, mass produced information services, like newspapers that held, if you like, the balance of power. So if these artists could exploit some of those systemic power possibilities, you know, through things like record labels and getting distribution and, and the radio and, all of that kind of thing, well, that, that was a great opportunity and that, that responded to what was happening at that time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>I think now we don't have that mass, possibility. It's much more fragmented. And I think there is, you know, obviously facilitated by something like the internet, there is this ability to interact with information in a way that is so far beyond what anyone could have possibly imagined in the sixties. Most normal people would imagine in the sixties anyway, that now we, we can't kind of bank on that particular approach. And I think somehow we, we shifted away from it in such a radical way that there's not necessarily, that we didn't necessarily put as much thought into how it was that we were going to begin to reposition ourselves in, in those questions. So I think there are, I think, you know, if we think about folk music, I think the idea of folk music still exists and holds particular values for me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>I know it's maybe a strange thing to say, but something like Burial from London, burial for me, is kinda like a contemporary folk music. And when you listen to some of those recent works, the pieces that are on, I think it's Rival Dealer with Come Down To Us, there's a whole really wonderful series of, of sort of samples that are, addressing ideas of trans<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_(software)">Jitter</a>ism in this piece. That's like, totally until the, <span style="color:red" data-ts="809.765" data-end_ts="809.965" title="809.765" id=c_"809.765">__like__</span> last couple of years, I'd really, I hadn't necessarily, it hadn't resonated with me as strongly, but I, when I come back to that piece now, I find it really, I mean, it's, because it's such a question, particularly in North America right now. You know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="820.925" data-end_ts="821.125" title="820.925" id=c_"820.925">__there__</span>, there's a, a kind of cultural resonance to the piece that's exceeds the music in a way, but it's still very much rooted in that local sense of community, very, <span style="color:red" data-ts="833.405" data-end_ts="833.605" title="833.405" id=c_"833.405">__or__</span> remains largely a mystery as an artist. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>And I think that's also a really interesting position. Mm-Hmm, <affirmative>, it's, there's something there. And I think for me, you know, this, the music that I, that I make isn't necessarily didactic. And I think it can, my interest is in presenting work that can be approached in any number of ways. And if you happen to become invested in the work, more than just listening to it once on a streaming service, which you know, is a fantastic thing, and thank you to people that do that. If they become more interested in, you know, what, what is cruel optimism or, you know, what, what are some of these, you know, what are these titles referring to? Or if they engage with some of the videos or whatever the case might be, there are these, I guess, doorways that allow people to kind of go deeper into what it is that I'm been addressing with the, with the last couple of records. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>And obviously conversations like this as well are a great way to do that. And I think what I think about generally with art and with music, practice, is that they are, they're the starting point for a conversation. They're not the terminus. And I think maybe in this period, that period that we were talking about before the, the, the late sixties and early seventies when, you know, there were very discreet engagements that it almost like that was the conversation, right? And I think for me, it's now we need to go go deeper than that. It needs to be more complex. It needs to be more nuanced, and it needs to be richer because we have this opportunity through something like a podcast or through something like the, any number of blogs, internet services, where you can really dig into something if you become interested in it, or even by chance, it's just about this sort of repetition of, a particular idea cropping up again and again in different circumstances. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>And somehow it takes on a kind of power. And I mean, for me, what I've been really happy to, to hear from people is when I've been talking about cruel optimism, a lot of people have gone to read the text that, you know, they didn't necessarily know the work. And for me, that's hugely valuable in the same way it was with, you know, one of my other literary obsessions, the Peregrine, you know, I've been so satisfied to know that that book has reached everyone from, from Verna Herzog all the way down and has become meaningful to people because I, you know, I honestly feel it's one of the great texts, the 20th century, and it has a kind of misanthropic poetic <span style="color:red" data-ts="967.365" data-end_ts="967.525" title="967.365" id=c_"967.365">__system__</span> that is very unusual, and it's a wonderful book of questioning human exceptionalism, which I think is very valuable. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I think that's really interesting though, that you're being thoughtful about the way that you lay out breadcrumbs for people to follow your, I was gonna say interests, but maybe it sounds like it might be closer to obsessions, <span style="color:red" data-ts="990.825" data-end_ts="991.045" title="990.825" id=c_"990.825">__but__</span> <laugh> <laugh>. But, it reminds me, I mean, I, there was a period of time where I had a, a very deep end, quite secret obsession with the band Steely Dan, and I'm, I'm supposed to be embarrassed to say that, except following little threads in their stuff. I got turned <span style="color:red" data-ts="1011.285" data-end_ts="1011.445" title="1011.285" id=c_"1011.285">__on__</span> to William, William Burroughs. I got turned on to, Wilhem Reich Uhhuh, you know, Uhhuh, just like all this kinda weird stuff. It, it opened a door because there were just these little tendrils of things that they had been obsessed with that I could follow if I was dedicated enough to track it. Right. And that ended up being a very rich way of engaging or in drawing me into a world outside of what they were providing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>Yeah. And look, I think that is very valuable to be, to be completely honest. I mean, that's how I discovered a lot of work. I mean, particularly down here when I was <span style="color:red" data-ts="1047.205" data-end_ts="1047.365" title="1047.205" id=c_"1047.205">__at__</span>, in my teens, Australia was a really long way away, and there was no internet. And, you know, I basically dealt with fan <span style="color:red" data-ts="1054.165" data-end_ts="1054.405" title="1054.165" id=c_"1054.165">__scenes__</span> and tape trading books. And it was through reading interviews with people sometimes that I discovered things like, I mean, it's interesting. Just recently I had the great, pleasure to spend an afternoon with Genesis <span style="color:red" data-ts="1068.515" data-end_ts="1068.805" title="1068.515" id=c_"1068.515">__Pric__</span>. Uhhuh <affirmative>, and I see Genesis as a really kind of critical intergenerational figure. The more I think about it, the more I recognize they are this very unique being that sits right at the nexus between that, that the kind of count for what better, one <span style="color:red" data-ts="1084.605" data-end_ts="1084.685" title="1084.605" id=c_"1084.605">__or__</span> the better word, counterculture of the 20th century. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>People like Burrows and Geen. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And then obviously having a huge impact Yeah. Themselves through, through Throbbing Grisel, through a whole range of kind of, you know, the Androgyny project, I think is an incredible exploration of identity. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, and then now connects into this next, the generation after, which is, you know, I guess people like me and, and, and younger, I recognize the importance of not just their, their work, but also how it is that they make the connections between those that are above them and below them. And I think that's actually one of the really important recognitions I've, I've come to recently, is how critical it is to, to make those connections and make them available for people like you. You know, the Steely <span style="color:red" data-ts="1130.885" data-end_ts="1131.045" title="1130.885" id=c_"1130.885">__Genius__</span> down example is a good one. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. See, I'm gonna have to live that down for the rest of my life too, now that I've revealed it <laugh>. But anyway. No, I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>Think, I think it's good. I mean, like, the thing is the breadcrumb can lead to the loaf, right? And that's, that's the trick, you know, and when it does, then the loaf leads to, well, how is it that bread's made? Mm-Hmm. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1150.845" data-end_ts="1150.885" title="1150.845" id=c_"1150.845">__<affirmative>__</span>. And then it leads to this other process, and it's this constant kind of revealing of the, the kind of cultural resonation that happens for people very individually. And I think that's really important. I mean, I look back at my own interests across the last 25, 30 years, and I mean, there's, so that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1170.965" data-end_ts="1171.365" title="1170.965" id=c_"1170.965">__point's__</span> incredibly in opposition to each other, but there is a strange thread of discovery and narratives that comes through those. And more and more certain things resonate stronger over time. You know, I'm mean a character like Bos for me is someone who ideally miss as a, as a kind of cultural entity because of that cheekiness <span style="color:red" data-ts="1191.705" data-end_ts="1191.925" title="1191.705" id=c_"1191.705">__and__</span> the dry sense of humor, but also the, the kind of refusal to accept power as this kind of unchangeable structure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and, and as corrupt to its core. I mean, the one thing that I, I remember reading his work, I came out of it with this sense that I never lost of the corruption of power. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>Yeah. And I mean, he was, he was very good at just twisting things ever so slightly. So the perspective entirely shift shifted. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And he did it usually with a little bit of humor. Right. Which was fantastic. Right. It may have been, may have been black as the night <laugh>, but it was still very funny. And so for me, yeah, I, I mean, I think that's actually one of the really important things that happens with making work and talking about work. Is that it, you, you make those connections available to people. They don't have to make, make the connections, but the opportunity is there when it's completely shut down. There is this kind of blankness that I think becomes really tiresome for me personally. Right. I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1256.365" data-end_ts="1256.525" title="1256.365" id=c_"1256.365">__love__</span>, I love that process of discovery, which may look <span style="color:red" data-ts="1260.125" data-end_ts="1260.325" title="1260.125" id=c_"1260.125">__it__</span>, you know, ultimately it may be a generational thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>When I was a teenager, I kind of did this internship in, in cultural archeology, which was basically going through fanzines and tape training manuals and trying to find this music that I would often read about that sounded incredible. And then I'd spend years looking for a demo tape that maybe was not good as the article that was written about the music, but it was still a, a sort of important process because I started to really think, well, how is it you access information? How is it that you make these connections available, to yourself and then ideally to others? Because, you know, that's, that's what the trading culture was about. And certainly what fanzines were about. We'd be sharing this information Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And there was a real sense of, I, I guess it was DIY, you know, and the way that you did it because you, you, there was no other way to, to do it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>And now I think there's this been, this shift, which is a really interesting kind of cultural phenomenon about this idea of access. Whereas, you know, before access was quite sometimes quite fraught. It was difficult to make, connections. It was difficult to find things. And now we have the complete antithesis of that. You know, if I was 18 now, I was 16 now, and growing up with something like Spotify or any other number of like Bandcamp or whatever the case might be, there is just so much access. There's this sort of smorgasbord approach, which is incredible, but also in some respects, what's fatiguing for one. Yeah. Because there is so much, you know, there's a sort of obesogenic cultural environment, and it's, it's also difficult maybe to find those points of navigation through so much, you know, the, the smorgasbord is so big, it's like a Vegas casino, you know, it's layer after layer of, of things, and you kind of get, you can get just caught in the foyer trying to check in, you know, so. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, the other, the other thing I worry about though, too, and, and I even see this in my own use of something like Spotify, I mean, the way it's, the way it's created is you almost feel bad if you become obsessive about a particular release. So, like, there's this one, Aldo Nova thing I, I really like. And, I listen to it a lot, but it seems like when I have 10 bazillion albums at my reach, it's somehow inappropriate for me to listen to one over and over again. Right. <laugh> Yeah, sure. Where, but to me, a large amount of how I learned and how I internalized music came by taking things that I liked and grew to love them over repeated listening. You know, maybe because at the time there was some scarcity involved. Yeah. But there was something about that process almost like monk-like process of learning the scriptures of some band or of some artist, through repetition that just seems like off the table now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>I mean, it could be a, a generational thing. I, I totally understand that position. And I think there is actually a real value, and I still do that. Like, there are certain records that I've listened to many, many hundreds of times that are, that are new, that are, you know, in the last sort of 10 years Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I really enjoy that process actually, because you, it's like any practice, you know, the more you engage with something, the richer it becomes. Ideally it's like, you know, fly fishing or <laugh> photography, whatever the case might be. The more you do it, the more attuned you become to the process of it. I mean, it's a lot like something like field recording is a great example. You know, field recording or listening more generally is not this, given, it's not a given. We have to cultivate it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>It's like being an athlete to some degree, you have to come to understand your own physiological capacity and your own sort of psychological interests. And from the, the, the sort of interplay between those things, your capacity for listening can, can blossom or not. And I think with music consumption, it's the same thing. You know, it's very easy to just keep going back for more something new all the time. And there's nothing wrong with that necessarily. But at some point, it's like the idea of the one night stand, eventually you want to have, it can be great fun. It can be really exhilarating and fulfilling to a point. But there's some stage where actually what you need is to drill deeper into the, the, the kind of possibilities of human interaction. I, in the same way that you need to draw deeper into the possibilities of music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>And if you do that, then I think music opens out in a way that can sustain you across your life. But for a lot of people, I don't think necessarily that that's what they do. And they've become rooted in a particular period. I mean, there is a reason that at least up until the last 10 years, the idea of golden radio, you know, the greatest hits of whatever generation it is that's being serviced by the radio, that exists for a reason. Because people have a somewhat limited engagement with the, the, the possibilities of their, of their listening to music that they, are, you know, there's a certain nostalgia maybe that plays into that. And there's a certain cultural overlay in terms of when it's acceptable to be listening to something like pop music. You know, how it's that your tastes develop over time. And so you become rooted in those periods. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>And I mean, that's, it's, Hey, there's nothing wrong with going back and celebrating the things that you listened to when you were 15 or 16 or 22 or whatever, 25, 30 even, whatever the case might be. But you don't continue to read the same book your entire life over. You don't watch the same film ad nauseum, you know, you still consume these other kind of, of cultural forms. Right. And it should be the same for music. And now particularly because there is this access that, that that's not the issue anymore. It's now like trying to find out how it is you make use of that access. Going back to, this idea that Neil Postman was talking about, the idea of the, the hierarchy of, of information and knowledge and wisdom, the music is the kind of information you have to then develop that into a kind of knowledge of how it is that you extract something more than the kind of just, simple pleasure of it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>That <span style="color:red" data-ts="1632.645" data-end_ts="1632.845" title="1632.645" id=c_"1632.645">__they__</span>, that it can become meaningful in your life. In the same way that any art can, you know, you can go to a gallery and plants through and, and see a whole bunch of, of images that some of them might stick with you, some of them don't. But the, your ability to drill into something, drill into one work that can totally open out a universe in and of itself. And it's about your commitment to that as a, as a, you know, whether it's as a practice, or whether it's as a, a kind of consumer. There's a, there's a, there's a real pleasure in going deeply into anything. That's why hobbies exist, you know? Right. Hobbies are kind of our excuse to go deeply into something 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. So you mentioned before that you kind of had yourself developed, education in music by doing the fanzine writing letters and sending 'em off. First of all, where did you grow up? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>I grew up in Brisbane. Okay. So it's basically like the, the, the subtropics of, of, Australia on the, on the East coast. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, and, this sort of like fanzine world you interacted with, what musical style were you tracking? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1704.395" data-end_ts="1704.685" title="1704.395" id=c_"1704.395">__Yeah__</span>, I mean, it was very broad <laugh>, very, very broad. But I mean, it was, a lot of it was to do with, I mean, I was really into kind of like glam rock and some sort of like performance art, like the cam black Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> from, from New York. And then industrial stuff and, and sort of black metal, I guess. But it was always very, there was a real visceral quality to the work, even if with the rock stuff. I mean, the visceral part was, I guess, the spectacle of it. Right. So for me, yeah, I, I, I also was, I liked the confrontation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_(software)">Jitter</a> politics in it, even though the, the I'm, I'm sure none of these people were thinking about it in that way, and potentially I wasn't either. But I found it really interesting. You know, I went to an all <span style="color:red" data-ts="1752.565" data-end_ts="1752.845" title="1752.565" id=c_"1752.565">__boys__</span> school. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>I was into this stuff that was, very much against the idea of hegemonic masculinity, <laugh>. And I, and I found that an interesting place to operate because it created such a tension for people. Right. I thought, well, if there's something there in that, then I think there's something interesting to be extracted out of why it is that there is this anxiety around how we express who it is we are. So, and, and then I guess that was kind of, you know, reflected in some of the, you know, I played in some industrial bands in, my late teens and early twenties. And, you know, that that again, was, there was a whole kind of overlay in that, that was about the, you know, what other elements can be used for music making that again, was kind of confrontational <span style="color:red" data-ts="1798.925" data-end_ts="1799.085" title="1798.925" id=c_"1798.925">__about__</span> how it's that we thought about music being made. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>And they were very sort of cursory engagements, really, you know, it's not like <span style="color:red" data-ts="1806.425" data-end_ts="1806.645" title="1806.425" id=c_"1806.425">__the__</span>, but they definitely contributed to something more than what they were at that time. And I think that's actually the value how things resonate across your life, becomes really valuable actually. Because it's when you can return to them and recognize, well, that was the seed of something that became a tree. Right. That the value, the value is there. And I mean, that's certainly even the way that I essentially came to recognize my interest in sound, was from a very similar kind of story. You know, when I was a little kid, I used to go birdwatching with my dad, at this area of the port, which is now condos, essentially <laugh>. But back then it was a massive array of kind of disused factories and, open grasslands that were had just overgrown. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>And there was this one particular area where there was a huge, mineral sandhill that we could go playing on. It's black mineral sand, which, you know, sort of sounds like a cancer trap, but I'm still here. So it clearly wasn't <laugh>. And anyway, the, there was, next to it, there was this fantastic kind of swamp land, but there was a creek that would overflow and fill up this, this particular area. And there was this one bird in there called a reed war <span style="color:red" data-ts="1880.085" data-end_ts="1880.325" title="1880.085" id=c_"1880.085">__blur__</span>. And my dad was quite a keen bird watcher, and, you know, would take me birdwatching. And there was, particularly when I was about sort of seven or eight, you know, giving a child binoculars is just a cruel trick because, you know, they can barely control their own senses, let alone the sort of hyper possibilities of, you know, a massive ocular increase. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>Right. So, you know, I was very frustrated looking at the spread. It's small, it's brown, it lives in the reeds, it's camouflage. It has the most incredible voice. Like, literally you stick a knob and it's back and twisted, and you've got the best handheld synthes synthesizer you've ever heard. It was really a quite amazing sounding bird. And, you know, I really wanted to see it. So I'd be using these binoculars, getting very frustrated. And after a couple of attempts, my, my father just said to me, you know, look, just close your eyes and listen for where the bird is. And when he'd, you do that and you get this idea of where it is, open your eyes and put the binoculars up there and, and see if you can look at it. So I did that. And, you know, after the second time it worked, I, I saw the bird. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>It was like, wow, this is amazing. And at that stage, not that I thought about it necessarily in these terms, but it was really the first time that I engaged with my audition as a way of understanding, sensing the world, you know? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and, and recognizing the spatial capacity that our, ears offer us in, in contrast to our, to our eyes. And I think that more and more, as I, you know, I think about that experience, it's a kind of fundamental way of approaching how it is that I've built up most of my, the rest of my life actually, of being interested in, how it is that we, we listen <span style="color:red" data-ts="1975.685" data-end_ts="1975.885" title="1975.685" id=c_"1975.685">__to__</span> how it is that sound affects us. Not just in a increasingly with performance too, you know, not just in a sort of psychological way, but also physiologically, the idea of the body <span style="color:red" data-ts="1986.325" data-end_ts="1986.485" title="1986.325" id=c_"1986.325">__as__</span> an ear, something I spend a lot of time exploring. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>And that interaction between, certain kinds of, of sounds and the body is really, I mean, for me, it's a massive part of what my performances are about. It's about the activation of the body and the recognition that there's this almost like synesthetic nexus that lies, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2005.665" data-end_ts="2005.885" title="2005.665" id=c_"2005.665">__but__</span> between our psychological, understanding of sound or music in this case, you know, as a sort of harmony or whatever the case might be, and this physiological idea that, that that sound transcends out of the psychological into the tactile, you know, it becomes about touch. And there's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2023.525" data-end_ts="2023.645" title="2023.525" id=c_"2023.525">__this__</span> shifting between the senses. I think that's a really interesting place to work. And when you can bend people in and out of those two positions in a, in a performance situation, it can be really powerful because you recognize not just your ability as a, a listener in terms of how it is that you psychologically interpret the material and how it makes you feel and the affect that has, but also this kind of much more primal, physiological engagement of the body in, in, in sound. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>And it's really, it's really powerful sometimes when that happens. I know I've had that in, in concert experiences, and when it, when it does connect for you, I think it really opens out how it is that you perceive yourself and others around you. This experience of what it means to come together to have a concert. I mean, a concert <span style="color:red" data-ts="2068.625" data-end_ts="2068.845" title="2068.625" id=c_"2068.625">__is__</span> incredible thing, you know, when you think about it, it's this completely individuated experience where each of us are drawing a particular thing out of it, but we are having it in a collective space. You know, there's this sort of solidarity that sound provides, that is still individuated and down to our particular way of coming at it from, with carrying with us that, that baggage, the, the sort of sociological political baggage that we bring to every situation that we encounter, but also that we're all sharing it together in time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>And the moment that that second ticks over that moment that we just had, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2106.605" data-end_ts="2106.765" title="2106.605" id=c_"2106.605">__it__</span> can't be returned to that was it. It's gone forever. And it's, you know, can only sort of be revived in the shallow grave of memory. So I think there's a really interesting, you know, almost like virtual public assembly that happens in performance or can happen in a kind of concert setting. And certainly this last tour of cruel optimism in North America, that was a big part of, what I wanted to, to share with people was to allow them the old, to create an invitation for them to recognize themselves and each other, and the value of that shared experience. Because I think that's something that has been degradated, this idea of community and of, of communal engagement and how it is that music can offer us, or sound or art, or any of these kind of cultural practices can offer us a way to connect with people that may not necessarily share the same views as us or share the same experience as us, but the quality of that engagement is a rich, thing in and of itself. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I'm glad you used the word communal there because, I recently had an experience. I went to a show and I was, I was older than everybody else that was there by a full generation, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, we've all been there. Don't worry. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thanks, man. I felt it was, it was amazing that, after the music started going and when there was breaks and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2197.185" data-end_ts="2197.405" title="2197.185" id=c_"2197.185">__so__</span> stuff, it seemed to like, because we were all enjoying it. We were there to experience something together. It opened doors for people to talk. People I never met before, and who probably wouldn't even see me if I passed them on the street. All <span style="color:red" data-ts="2213.725" data-end_ts="2213.765" title="2213.725" id=c_"2213.725">__of__</span> a sudden we become, we become part of a community and we're able to share discussions, you know, share, share a bite to eat or whatever. It's, it was really quite stunning how much being there together for that common goal of enjoying this specific music really opened up that communal behavior. That's something that seems to be kind of rapidly going away when, or I don't want to be too overbearing about that. I don't wanna be, you know, kind of like flapping my hands and saying, oh, everything's going to shit because everyone just plays Call of Duty all the time. Right. But I do think that maybe we've stopped thinking about that as being important or something. I don't know. I dunno. But I was just really taken by, what amazing thing that was in comparison to every other place I see in society that I generally interact with. It's kind of weird. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>Yeah. I mean, it's interesting. I think there's been a, if we're talking about this idea of community, at some point in the last, I don't know how long, maybe 25 years or something, there has been this shift, which probably has been facilitated in some respects by something like the internet. And like when you look at platforms like Facebook or whatever the case is, I mean, there's a lot of kind of discourse around this at the moment. You know, it, this idea of the kind of, you know, mirror reflection of ourselves, I think that's actually really quite valid. You know, that community for me is not about agreeing with people all the time. I mean, I have a gentleman here that I see every, you know, every week or sometimes several times a week, who I do not categorically do not share his political views about the world or about humanity. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>But I always have a conversation with this guy because he's part of the community here. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And he can be quite prickly. And that's, I actually quite enjoy that in some sort of six sadistic sense <laugh>. But I think it's useful because actually we need to know more than ourselves. You know, that that's part of the, the way that we have progressed. And I think that we will progress into the future. This idea that we wanna shut people out. And like when you look at the, the kind of neo-Nazi situation, this idea of like wanting to block people out, just having certain kinds of things, well, that's a denial of community, in the terms of this idea of community that I think is valuable. You know, if we're all the same, it's really boring. My God, is it boring? There's nothing there to kind of, and then when you get bored, you end up doing stupid things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>It's as simple as that. You know, the, that that kind of, finding things <span style="color:red" data-ts="2369.815" data-end_ts="2370.165" title="2369.815" id=c_"2369.815">__vital__</span> hands to do, it's kind of true. So I think, you know, when, when we have these new engagements every day when you're being challenged to think, well, you know, if someone else believes this, well, how is it, why is it that I believe what I believe? You know, that kind of contrast, that can come from engagement, proper engagement in a communal setting that is not just a sort of reflection of your particular interests can be really valuable and it can be challenging. And it, I think part of it is that it does require a commitment, and it requires you to be engaged and it means that you can't just kind of be removed, that there needs to be a presence. You need to be present. And I think that's something that we maybe struggle with a little bit. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>I mean, to, I've read the classic example is there's a reason that mindfulness is so hot right now is because it encourages this idea of, of, of presence of being present. I think that's something that maybe a, a lot of people are struggling to do because of the mechanisms of engagement that we have, like email, which is, you know, a great example of not being present because it's not even time-based essentially. But there is this expectation that it will be time-based, you know, that if you send someone an email, that they will email you straight back. Right? So there's this strange kind of zone in there that is unclear about expectation and about how it is that we use these things and what it is they do and don't replace in our lives more generally. And I think we've replaced a lot of things with these facilities that maybe we, we didn't think about, and it just sort of happened. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>And now we're kind of caught out by that. So for me, I'm very conscious of, of this idea of what it means, what public assembly means, what the value of it is. What I mean, there's a fantastic Judith Butler book about a sort of performative practice of public assembly, and she draws this distinction between the people and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2485.105" data-end_ts="2485.325" title="2485.105" id=c_"2485.105">__our__</span> people and, you know, the people as being instantly setting up <span style="color:red" data-ts="2489.485" data-end_ts="2489.685" title="2489.485" id=c_"2489.485">__and__</span>, and other, whereas <span style="color:red" data-ts="2491.185" data-end_ts="2491.405" title="2491.185" id=c_"2491.185">__up__</span> people kind of being a more inclusive term. And I think there's a really interesting linguistic conversation to, to have there about how it is certain languages, the way that we use language. Was it that, Judith Butler who wrote a lot about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_(software)">Jitter</a> she wrote <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_(software)">Jitter</a> Trouble, a whole bunch of different books about, about heteronormativity and, ideas of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_(software)">Jitter</a> fluidity, a whole bunch of different things. Fantastic. Another, a fantastic contribution from, from North America <laugh>. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, good. Something to offset our, our little fiasco we have going on right now. So in talking about community and the, and the importance of it and us kind of feeding community, and also the fact that I do want to talk to you a little bit about your musical work. You just got done touring off of, or behind the cruel optimism release, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>Yeah. I did the first kind of, run of shows in, in particularly in North America. I mean the, the European shows are a little bit later this year. And same with Australia, the next, a lot of shows are in Australia <span style="color:red" data-ts="2553.265" data-end_ts="2553.485" title="2553.265" id=c_"2553.265">__in__</span> June 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Was Cruel optimism. Wasn't that a, a collaboration? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>I mean, it, it's a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2558.765" data-end_ts="2558.965" title="2558.765" id=c_"2558.765">__solo__</span> composition, I guess you would say, but I actually wanted to reach out to a lot of people and to make the record in a more collaborative way. I mean, I spent a lot of time, particularly in the late nineties and early thousands mm-Hmm. <affirmative> doing collaborator recording and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2574.525" data-end_ts="2574.645" title="2574.525" id=c_"2574.525">__p__</span> playing, not so much in bands, but almost like collectives, you know, that there would be people that would come in and out at certain gigs. I did have a, a trio as well, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2582.645" data-end_ts="2582.765" title="2582.645" id=c_"2582.645">__I__</span> three with two other musicians, Heinz Reg and Tam Patton. We played a lot during that period. And we would often collaborate with other people like <span style="color:red" data-ts="2590.425" data-end_ts="2590.645" title="2590.425" id=c_"2590.425">__Di__</span> Olive or Scanner and David <span style="color:red" data-ts="2592.565" data-end_ts="2592.725" title="2592.565" id=c_"2592.565">__Tupe__</span>. We made these records very early on, on Room 40, that, that were about that kind of exchange that can happen between people in a, in a sort of performative context. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>And I guess since probably about 10 years, I hadn't really spent that much time really invested in, in, in terms of my own work about having a collaborator practice and working with other musicians around ideas. I'd done projects like Slow Walkers or the Hexa Project with Jamie Stewart Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, that were more invested collaborations, but not so much in terms of my own work. And, I really wanted to, to change that with cruel optimism. I was interested in how it was that <span style="color:red" data-ts="2633.285" data-end_ts="2633.405" title="2633.285" id=c_"2633.285">__I__</span> kind of, I guess what we were describing before this idea of community, how it is, those interactions that are unexpected make you reassess what it is you're doing with yourself or with the work in this case. And I found it really valuable actually to, in some cases, send material to people and have them respond in some cases, be there in real time with people. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>What it was that came out of those processes. I mean, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2656.485" data-end_ts="2656.605" title="2656.485" id=c_"2656.485">__I__</span> had a wonderful few days recording with Thor Harrison in, at his home in, in Austin. And what it was that he bought to the record in the end was not what I would've necessarily expected. You know, his choices around harmony are very different to mine. He has his own harmonic language, and that in turn, reshapes how it is that I have to approach the, the, the kind of material, sonic materials that I had, at one point. And the same with recording with someone like, Heinz Regula, who lives in Austria, was here, just happened to be here for a couple of weeks. And we spent an afternoon together, and some of his contributions to the record entirely resolved some of the pieces, you know, that they were, there was one piece in particular, this objective projection piece that was essentially not gonna be part of the record, but thanks to his way of approaching it, he unlocked this other part that I couldn't, couldn't get to. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>So that was really the value <span style="color:red" data-ts="2712.665" data-end_ts="2712.885" title="2712.665" id=c_"2712.665">__of__</span>, of the exchanges, was that other people's interests, their capacities twist and, and turn the kind of ways that you approach and appreciate certain qualities in the work that you're doing, I feel, anyway. Sure. And the record becomes much richer for that because people are, are cha in some respects, they're kind of challenging you on it. Like, actually, I, I can bring this to this thing. I mean, I had a great, evening recording with Norman Westberg here when he was on tour and we were recording some, some works for a, an upcoming solo project of his. And in the evenings we recorded for a couple of hours for the, the Cruel Optimism Project. And it was amazing. Like just the sheer physicality of his playing completely changed the way that I thought about one of the pieces that in fact, the negative drone piece is very much down to his playing of my baritone guitar. And that piece took shape around this sort of backbone that he offered, which was not just the actual sound that he generated, but the way that he did it. I found really inspirational. And I think that was, there were a lot of moments like that as the record took shape that really made me think, okay, this is the, this is the value in, in collaboration. It really can completely open out closed possibilities and it can shut down open ones as well, which is really important as well. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2797.835" data-end_ts="2798.125" title="2797.835" id=c_"2797.835">__Well__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. It's especially bad when you're working on a thing and you, you get this sense that, ah, Jesus, this could fork in any one of four ways and I don't even know which one I wanna put my weight behind. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>Absolutely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Absolutely. And having someone be able to say, you know what, it feels like it's drawing me this way. It's almost kind of a relief to be able to have somebody offer that to you. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>Yeah. And it can, sometimes it forces your hand. You, I mean, the thing is, you know, sometimes you know you've got something that's nothing, you know, and you just have to have someone say that's nothing. Yeah. <laugh>. And it's really valuable. And I've had that a couple of times. I've been really lucky with people. I've got a few friends that have been incredibly, important in that regard. Like Ben Frost, when I was making Wilderness of Mirrors, had a very early version of the record. He's like, nah, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't buy it. Basically like two or three pieces. And then, you know, that completely reset my listening to that material. So it's incredibly valuable to have those <span style="color:red" data-ts="2858.245" data-end_ts="2858.525" title="2858.245" id=c_"2858.245">__known__</span>, you know, I'd often do that for other artists, you know, whether it's editing materials that they send or sometimes, remixing things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>I was working on some mixes ironically for, for Ben this year, which was very much in about that process of like trying to, flip around how he was, how he was approaching the, the materials and how what it was that the character of the sound and the pieces was, was going to reveal. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So it's really valuable. Collaboration is a really valuable thing. Community is a really valuable thing. And I think somehow we've not necessarily recognized what it is we've lost. And I, I certainly am very conscious of trying to reconnect to some of those things that maybe have drifted away in the last sort of eight to 10 years. Sure. You know, more broadly, not just in my own life. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So my question now though is you, you went on tour supporting this stuff. How do you, I I was unfortunately I didn't get a chance to see you when, when you did this run. How do you, how do you approach the performance of something that in your mind at least, is a collaborative work? How do you present it? How do you like play it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>I mean, look, the, ultimately the, for me, the, the success of cool optimism was that all of the components of the material forge they serve the piece. It's not, it's not collaboration in the idea that, I guess you might have, like if you think of a jazz improvisation, that there might be a solo, that someone becomes a focus, it was much more diffuse. And I think what's, for me, there's a big delineation between studio practice and live practice. You know, that stuff I was speaking about before in terms of the idea of bodily affect and the way it is that we recognize the body is an ear and its function in, in something like a performance setting. I think that's really very valuable there. But that can't necessarily and potentially shouldn't be replicated in a studio practice. The cruel optimism of the album and cruel optimism of the concert, if you like, are, are two quite separate, but related things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>And what I'm interested in pulling out of a performance is not necessarily what I'm interested in pulling out of, kind of recording the performance is very much about the physicality of the material and about relief. You know, that there can be <span style="color:red" data-ts="3005.985" data-end_ts="3006.185" title="3005.985" id=c_"3005.985">__at__</span> points, so much information that you've almost gotta attach yourself to one element in there and, and have that pull you through. And there are moments where, I mean, I'm definitely interested in the idea of like, can, like when we're there in that space together, can we do it? Can we, can we reach that point where it's just almost too much, or maybe it is too much for, for a moment, and then it's not, it's gone. And what does that absence mean? What does the presence of the <span style="color:red" data-ts="3032.365" data-end_ts="3032.525" title="3032.365" id=c_"3032.365">__ma__</span> of the material mean? And what's that tension that can be, present mean for us? So yeah, it was interesting. I mean, coming to the <span style="color:red" data-ts="3043.005" data-end_ts="3043.085" title="3043.005" id=c_"3043.005">__work__</span> I definitely had to think about. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I wanna, I wanna stop you right there, because actually the way that you just said that if, if there was a way to take your music and put it into words, you just sort of did it. Thank God by 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>Talking totally. The pressures off <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>No, but this idea of building up, looking for what's on the other side and the tension and, and not only looking for the relief of the tension, but also embracing the tension, right? Yeah. This is something that's kind of, I feel like is, is sort of a thread through all of your work. And, and it's kind of interesting because it, it feels like it's the place where your kind of, your intellectual pursuits and your creative pursuits kind of meet and intermingle in a pretty, pretty significant way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>I look, I hope so. I mean, I want, I want there to be, you know, nothing, nothing good ever comes easy, really. Or <span style="color:red" data-ts="3104.515" data-end_ts="3104.805" title="3104.515" id=c_"3104.515">__that__</span>, I don't know if that's exactly true, but I, I tend to enjoy things that I, that I work for. The more I invest in something, the, the richer the experience is. And I think that goes for everything from relationships through to making art, through to engaging with critical theory, whatever it's that you wanna do. I think there is a certain 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>Additional pleasure that it's like, actually, you know what it's like, it's like exercise. I do, I do a bit of boxing and there is a certain moment where you question whether your body can physically continue doing whatever it is that it's doing, whether it's lifting something or whatever the case might be. And when you do achieve that, and even if it's about building it up over several months to be able to achieve that, there is a, there is a payoff there. It's like a physiological payoff and it's a psychological payoff that you, you did it not just with your body, but also with your mind. And that's, you know, they often say with weightlifters, the, the greatest strength has to be in the mind, not in the, not in the body. 'cause you need to know that you can do it. And if you don't, then you'll never be able to lift it. And I think that's part of <span style="color:red" data-ts="3171.065" data-end_ts="3171.285" title="3171.065" id=c_"3171.065">__the__</span>, the payoff for me is around this idea of the investment of the self and the in investment. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3178.115" data-end_ts="3178.405" title="3178.115" id=c_"3178.115">__Some__</span> not just in, you know, about being about you, but also like what that can mean for other people. You know, that through you better preparing yourself or whatever the case might be, that there is a payoff for those around you that you, can benefit them as well as yourself. And there's this kind of, again, this communal idea of what, what can be 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Computerly said. Well, you know, I, I wanted to quiz you about room 40, the label. I wanted to talk about a bunch of stuff related to your, field recording work, but our time is more than up and I'm kicking myself, but at the same time, what a fantastic conversation. I wanna thank you so much for taking the time to have a chat. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>My pleasure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And, I am going to want to pinging you again at some time in the near future to talk about these other things because I do wanna hear more about the, especially when you talk about like growing into the practice of field recording and stuff. I really want to hear more about that and talk about what it's like to be a label runner for as long as you've been doing it as well. So we'll get back and we'll talk about those things again in another conversation. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>Sounds great. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright man, well I want to thank you again for the time and, and, wish you a good evening. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Lawrence: </b>Thank you, Don. Take care. Bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, spring has come here in Minnesota and so I'm getting to edit the podcast out in the backyard. It's pretty great. Hopefully you can hear some of the birds in the background. I want to thank Lawrence for taking the time out of his busy schedule to chat with us. But also I wanna thank you again, the listeners. We bridged 500,000 downloads, which is kind of amazing to me. That's a lot of man hours shot <laugh> over the course of this podcast. I really appreciate everybody's listening, spreading the word. And, thanks for all the kind of words I've gotten recently as well. Again, if you have any questions or comments, drop me a line ddg@cyclingseventyfour.com. Otherwise, I'll see you next week. Bye.
