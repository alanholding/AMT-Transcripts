<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, today I have the great pleasure of getting a chance to talk to, someone that was recommended to me by a friend. He's somebody I've known from the Max World for a long time. But he's got a real wide range of interests and people that he's influencing as well. His name's Tron <span style="color:red" data-ts="36.045" data-end_ts="36.325" title="36.045" id=c_"36.045">__SIUs__</span>, or a <span style="color:red" data-ts="37.345" data-end_ts="37.565" title="37.345" id=c_"37.345">__eus__</span>. What would be the best way for me to say that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Trond Lossius: </b>I'm fine with it. Either way. Either way, <laugh>. Alright. In, in Norwegian, I would say SIUs, but I tweak it myself when I speak English. I see. It sounds strange as <span style="color:red" data-ts="48.845" data-end_ts="49.045" title="48.845" id=c_"48.845">__way__</span>, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. So I'm gonna call you Tron <span style="color:red" data-ts="51.385" data-end_ts="51.605" title="51.385" id=c_"51.385">__for__</span> the rest, for the rest of the way, and we'll go with that. But with that, I see Hi to you. <span style="color:red" data-ts="55.745" data-end_ts="55.965" title="55.745" id=c_"55.745">__How__</span>, how are you today? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Trond: </b>I'm fine, thanks. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thank you so much for taking time out of your schedule to have a chat with us. What I'd like to do is kind of kick off by having you talk a little bit about, about your work. What are the things that you're currently really, into? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Trond: </b>I have a background as a composer. I was educated as a composer, and then I got involved with, working with Sun Installations, which meant that there was like a shift in where I worked from, like the music community much more towards like the fine arts community. And and I find that sort of like working between those two practices or those two fields or those two <span style="color:red" data-ts="95.845" data-end_ts="96.125" title="95.845" id=c_"95.845">__disco__</span>, discourses I found to be very interesting. So that's kind of like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="102.285" data-end_ts="102.485" title="102.285" id=c_"102.285">__no__</span>, wow. I still am like 15, at least years later. I really enjoy working in collaboration with other artists and projects that are multimedia where I mostly work on sound, but combine it with video or paintings or sculpture. Sometimes <span style="color:red" data-ts="119.485" data-end_ts="119.765" title="119.485" id=c_"119.485">__there__</span> were might be theater projects, but I really enjoy working in these cross-disciplinary settings. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. That's, that's actually interesting and I want to dive into that a little bit more later on because the idea of working in collaborations is something that I really enjoy a lot. I find it really kind of helps me get a vision for a specific project. But before we go there, I want to ask you about a couple of specific, things that you work on. First of all, you are most known to me as a member of the Max community, but also as a member of the <span style="color:red" data-ts="157.385" data-end_ts="157.605" title="157.385" id=c_"157.385">__Jam__</span> development group. Is that correct? Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Trond: </b><affirmative>. Yeah, that's right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Can you explain for the listeners a little bit what <span style="color:red" data-ts="163.985" data-end_ts="164.205" title="163.985" id=c_"163.985">__Jam__</span> is? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Trond: </b>Yeah. I think I'll do that by going back to why I started being involved with it in the first place. And that was back in 2002 when I was working with a contemporary theater at a company in Norway that's called <span style="color:red" data-ts="181.325" data-end_ts="182.005" title="181.325" id=c_"181.325">__<inaudible>__</span>. They performed international quite a bit and, we were working on a production where we wanted to do a lot of sound processing on the voices of the Actos. So, artistically speaking, you know, the idea was that rather than thinking in a very traditional film way in terms of different layers of sound where you might have like the background sound and you might have music, and then you have the voices of the actors, we wanted to blur all of that and maybe be able to create this sonic background <span style="color:red" data-ts="215.065" data-end_ts="215.285" title="215.065" id=c_"215.065">__and__</span> the whole sonic world that the actors lived within by processing their voices. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Trond: </b>So <span style="color:red" data-ts="222.175" data-end_ts="222.395" title="222.175" id=c_"222.175">__if__</span> for most of that production, the voices would be like completely abstract. You couldn't understand what they were saying, but it was much more about like a certain aesthetic sensation of sound and how those sounds evolved from the actors. So obviously we used Max extensively for this. And, we met a lot of challenges in the production because the production was that big that we needed to be more than one person working on all of these patches and controlling the logics of them, you know, both in rehearsals development and in performance. And, we struggle with things like, how do you control your max patches as they grow really large? Right? Because here it's not just that <span style="color:red" data-ts="266.695" data-end_ts="266.855" title="266.695" id=c_"266.695">__the__</span>, there's lots of things going on, but five minutes later <span style="color:red" data-ts="270.405" data-end_ts="270.695" title="270.405" id=c_"270.405">__that__</span> might be a lot of other things going on <laugh> and you know, this way all through the production. So it became like a lot of logics of, you know, logistics of how you control these kind of systems. You know, when you have like a performance that is lasting for an hour and also being more than one. I mean, I guess we all inherited max patches from someone else. And I think, <span style="color:red" data-ts="292.055" data-end_ts="292.215" title="292.055" id=c_"292.055">__you__</span> know, most of the time it's not the pleasant experience, <laugh>, we all, we all seem to have our own, you know, very <span style="color:red" data-ts="298.695" data-end_ts="299.015" title="298.695" id=c_"298.695">__strange__</span> way of working on patches. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And everyone else's way is wrong also. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Trond: </b><laugh> not necessarily, you know, might be that <span style="color:red" data-ts="306.955" data-end_ts="307.175" title="306.955" id=c_"306.955">__my__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="307.175" data-end_ts="307.335" title="307.175" id=c_"307.175">__is__</span> too, but, you know, <laugh>, we all find our own particular wrongs, I think <laugh>, right? So, so, so anyway, I mean, I saw the challenges both in, in terms of how do you control <span style="color:red" data-ts="317.295" data-end_ts="317.615" title="317.295" id=c_"317.295">__large__</span> max patches and also how do you manage to kind of come up with some conventions that makes it easier at least, to collaborate. And, and then I started looking around for solutions, you know, or, you know, if someone else were addressing similar problems. And one of the things that stuck me as relevant, was the, was the work that <span style="color:red" data-ts="340.295" data-end_ts="340.495" title="340.295" id=c_"340.295">__Tim__</span> Place was doing on Jade back then, right? So I checked that out and I was thinking that, you know, probably the way it was currently, it wouldn't necessarily work for us, but he certainly had a number of approaches, a number of ideas that would be very interesting to learn more about. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Trond: </b>So I organized a workshop, here in Norway in 2003, and we were able to invite him over for it, which was brilliant. And what was even better was that, you know, after workshop he came over to Bergen and we spent a number of more days, you know, discussing and brainstorming between the two of us. And I think he had already been thinking of open sourcing parts of Jade. So I <span style="color:red" data-ts="384.605" data-end_ts="384.765" title="384.605" id=c_"384.605">__said__</span> that if he did that, you know, I would be very interested in contributing towards it. So that's what became Jamal. But it's like the initial motivation for the <span style="color:red" data-ts="397.005" data-end_ts="397.205" title="397.005" id=c_"397.005">__Oma__</span> system for me was to find a structured way of addressing the kind of challenges you meet when you work with really large max projects and you beyond the simple prototyping, sta you know, yeah. You don't just like small prototyping or small projects towards much larger productions and to find a structured approach towards that. And I think that still remains very much, you know, one of the core, problems or challenges that <span style="color:red" data-ts="430.345" data-end_ts="430.565" title="430.345" id=c_"430.345">__jam__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="430.675" data-end_ts="430.965" title="430.675" id=c_"430.675">__MoMA__</span> try to, to help you solve. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, it's actually, it's a very pointed thing you talk about because in a way, there's value to having Max not provide a lot of infrastructure, but on the other hand, it also, with that freedom comes a lot of potential problems when you're trying to, especially as you point out when you're trying to coordinate among a bunch of users, a <span style="color:red" data-ts="457.885" data-end_ts="457.925" title="457.885" id=c_"457.885">__bunch__</span> among a bunch of people all attempting to, solve <span style="color:red" data-ts="463.325" data-end_ts="463.445" title="463.325" id=c_"463.325">__a__</span>, solve a problem together. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Trond: </b>Yeah, it is, and I think it's, I mean, it's great that, max starts out with just an empty patch because I think, I mean, the thing, I think at the end of the day, the thing I've loved the most about Max has always been that it's not a program that is pushing me in particular directions. You know, which are the directions that this program want to push everyone in. I find it a very free, liberating program. And there's lots of other like, music software, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="496.125" data-end_ts="496.325" title="496.125" id=c_"496.125">__which__</span> will quickly invite you to create a certain kind of music, right? And if you don't wanna do that, you have to be aware of it and kind of like fight it a bit. But I think with Max, you know, it's such liberating things and I think, you know, I mean it's, I've seen patches that are a complete mess and they are, you know, all the better for that. But just like <laugh> speaking for myself and the project I've been working, sometimes we've needed to have very structured approaches to it, and not least be because Max is as extendable as it is with SDK and so on, it has been possible for us to do that. And, and I think that's great 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Indeed. So, now the other thing that I know you, know of you doing, in relationship to music and music technology and art technology is working in a lot of, what I would call massive speaker arrays or, or surround systems with large number of speakers, and particularly working with ambusonics type, systems. Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Trond: </b><affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Could you tell me a little bit about that? And again, I am, I'm kind of needing you to help provide some definition for listeners who might not be familiar with what Ambusonics is or what other, surround systems you might be exploring. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Trond: </b>Yeah, sure. Again, I think I will start out with, you know, what was the motivation for getting into this, which happened very accidentally. I think, I mean, by the end of my composition <span style="color:red" data-ts="596.965" data-end_ts="597.285" title="596.965" id=c_"596.965">__studies__</span>, I was very influenced by, for instance, Eric Satit, John Cage, Brian <span style="color:red" data-ts="603.405" data-end_ts="603.605" title="603.405" id=c_"603.405">__Eno__</span>, particular Brian Eno and the minimalist music. So I liked things that we're moving really slowly or, you know, even better if it's not moving at all. And rather than focusing on the relationships between notes, which I think has been one of the big discourses of, classical music, you know, over maybe the last thousand years, you know, which notes should stand next to each other. Right? I just wanted to enter inside one <span style="color:red" data-ts="631.595" data-end_ts="631.885" title="631.595" id=c_"631.595">__note__</span> and stretch it out. So when I started working with these installations, I was thinking that, you know, maybe if I used more than two speakers so that they were surrounding you and you were physically stepping inside the sound, maybe that would also help you mentally to stop inside the sound in terms of how you're listening to it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Trond: </b>So that was like the motivation wire. The first time used four speakers Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And then I was like really amazed of, the difference between the stereo and the four channels and like all of the expressive and emotional potential that it started revealing. So it just became a field that I was deeply fascinated by and just wanted to continue exploring, where I think, you know, in a way, and I often think of what I'm doing as a kind of sculptural practice, but I'm working on an invisible, untouchable, sculptural medium, which is sound, but it's really about how the sound exists in and surround you, in the space is one of the things that's fascinating with me deeply. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Trond: </b>So, so I mean, this first project that I'm referring to, I think happened back in 2001. And, and I didn't know much about specialization, and there weren't that much techniques available in Max. <span style="color:red" data-ts="715.605" data-end_ts="715.725" title="715.605" id=c_"715.605">__I__</span> mean, all of these kind of objects that you'd know and use know, like the <span style="color:red" data-ts="720.465" data-end_ts="720.685" title="720.465" id=c_"720.465">__VAP__</span> that made, or the ambisonic externals that was first made by <span style="color:red" data-ts="726.025" data-end_ts="726.245" title="726.025" id=c_"726.025">__IC__</span> Aste <span style="color:red" data-ts="726.845" data-end_ts="726.965" title="726.845" id=c_"726.845">__in__</span> Zurich. And then others have been making, similar things later on. All of that kind of like appeared little by little. So whenever I got my hands <span style="color:red" data-ts="736.345" data-end_ts="736.565" title="736.345" id=c_"736.345">__on__</span> a new specialization technique, I was very curious about, you know, trying to understand both the theory of it, the assumptions of it, and then explore how I might artistically use it. And very often, I mean, I've been kind of like doing things that are, <span style="color:red" data-ts="751.125" data-end_ts="751.325" title="751.125" id=c_"751.125">__you__</span> know, completely wrong in terms of the <laugh>, you know, what you're supposed to do, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Trond: </b>You know, which, you know, using it in ways that it was not intended for at all. But that still produce very interesting, spatial results in the space. So this has just been, again, ongoing exploration because I think, you know, one of the things that triggers me creatively is to work on something that I didn't know. I, I don't know it fully from beforehand, so I'm kind of like discovering for the first time myself in the process of making it work. I think that often helps me working with it in intuitive way that I find, you know, brings interesting results. While if I work on things that I know deeply, I dunno what to do with that money longer. So I have to find something else I don't know and explore. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Trond: </b>So, so, so these kind of like explorations have just been ongoing and are still ongoing. I mean, I still find things that I don't know. And I think in particular in the last five years, or six years, I've been very interested in doing field recordings, using a microphone that is ambisonic. And ambisonic is, is basically just a way of storing, multi-channel files in such a way that you don't have to decide when you record exactly what your speaker layer is gonna be like. Right. You can, you can kind of decode or interpret it with different speaker setups later on, which means that you can use less or more speakers, you can position them differently, and you can get a system that's working quite well. So there's a flexibility in it. And it's also that this microphone, it's, it is doing like four channel recordings, so I can use that on a portable record and actually, you know, carry it around and do recordings in the surroundings. And I find these recordings very interesting to do because it's not just a matter of recording some sound, but for me now, it's very much about recording places and listening into places, and then working with the idea of <span style="color:red" data-ts="877.535" data-end_ts="877.885" title="877.535" id=c_"877.535">__place__</span> later on. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I'm really curious. You obviously are well versed in technology and technological concepts, but you have this background where you're a studied composer. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Trond: </b>Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative>. And, but you also have this tremendous curiosity. I mean, quite frankly, an awful lot of people. The second that they find something that's interesting to them, that's the last learning that they kind of ever do. And so it's always encouraging and exciting to me to hear from people who talk about, you know, really having a life of questing. Right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And you definitely are that. Can you tell me a little bit about your background <span style="color:red" data-ts="924.165" data-end_ts="924.525" title="924.165" id=c_"924.165">__you're__</span> growing up and what you're, what, what it was like growing up and what led to you being the kind of artist that you are? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Trond: </b>Wow. Wow. <laugh> to, to the extent that I know <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, right. To the extent that you can figure it out. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Trond: </b>So, I mean, as, as a, <span style="color:red" data-ts="942.085" data-end_ts="942.205" title="942.085" id=c_"942.085">__i__</span> I grew up, you know, in the suburb outside Bergen, which is, you know, a pretty small town by international standard, but it's the second biggest one in Norway. Part of a very big family. I have six siblings. So I guess, you know, being in the middle of, of the seven of us, you know, I really felt the need to find some spaces where I could withdraw and like recover from the, from the noise of the family. Sure. So I think very often, you know, I would just like sit by the window and watch cars pass by, or, you know, go out and just sit on a rock in the forest and just sit there for an hour and just observe the leaves moving or, you know, whatever. And I guess that's the kind of like experience that <span style="color:red" data-ts="989.125" data-end_ts="989.245" title="989.125" id=c_"989.125">__I__</span> was, again, discovering and recognizing when I first, I got to know the ambient music of Brian <span style="color:red" data-ts="996.555" data-end_ts="996.845" title="996.555" id=c_"996.555">__Eino__</span>, which was very different from the kind of pop music and rock music that, you know, you otherwise would be exposed to, mostly as a teenager. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Trond: </b>And from him, you know, I went on to discover other kinds of musicians, you know, with these dissimilar tendency of listening to something for an extended while. So, so in terms of education, I have a very mixed background. 'cause I first studied, natural science. So I have a master thesis in geophysics, which was oceanography. But my master thesis was itself quite cross-disciplinary, it could just as easily fit in information science or in, mathematics, I think <span style="color:red" data-ts="1037.005" data-end_ts="1037.205" title="1037.005" id=c_"1037.005">__Sure__</span>. As in geophysics. Right. And then I made like this abrupt shift to composition because, you know, the, the dream for me was to work with music. And for a long time I didn't know how to do it and where to start, how to get going. But then I was very lucky to, to meet the number of people that like, had a belief in me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Trond: </b>And this supported my development in different ways so that it became possible to start studying composition. And at the time I was thinking that, okay, so that was like one study lost, but by the end of the composition studies when I discovered Max, it was like, you know, suddenly these two things came together. And of course that was really attractive to me, you know, because it was like, you know, certainly able to pull on a lot of things that I had but had not used for a number of years. Right. And then later on, you know, because of this interest in the cross-disciplinarity between music and fine arts, I did a artistic research fellowship at the Art Academy in Bergen. Okay. Which <span style="color:red" data-ts="1096.005" data-end_ts="1096.165" title="1096.005" id=c_"1096.005">__is__</span>, which is a similar thing to a PhD, although I don't have the formal degree. Right. So that's a very mixed background. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, indeed. It is an advanced background. Now, I'm, I'm curious to what extent, I mean, you talk about the, the work that you did in geophysics as being sort of like, you know, also mathematical and statistical and technological. Yeah. Yeah. But also earlier you kind of mentioned that what are the things that you're sort of into is these recordings of places. Hmm. And I'm wondering to what extent those studies in geophysics had or have some effect on how you choose places to record or what it is you're listening when you get get to a place? You know, I, I have a friend who, was a biologist before he got into art and composition. And a lot of his work is related to, species going extinct and stuff. And, and you know, his biology background definitely informs his artistic ba his artistic work a lot. What do you see, other than the technology comfort? Do you see much crosswork between those areas? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Trond: </b>I have to think because I mean, I've never thought of it that way before. I, I guess, you know, because of part of my geophysics studies, I was also studying meteorology. So I think like serving the weather, and we have a lot of weather in Bergen, you know? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> mostly of the rainy kind <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Trond: </b>But, but, but, but, but I think definitely that, that's something I'm, I'm very aware of. And also I think that the weather is, you know, you know, when you thinking of paces around here, it's impossible to think of them without including, you know, weather as, as, as, you know, something that is making a deep impression in terms of, you know, where the place is 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. And what it feels like. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Trond: </b>Yeah. But, but I think apart from that, I mean, most of the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1215.645" data-end_ts="1215.885" title="1215.645" id=c_"1215.645">__field__</span> recordings are due, are really just like re recordings from very mundane, suburbs. I think in that respect, maybe that goes back a bit to, in particular, the very first years of my life when we were living next to, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1230.915" data-end_ts="1231.205" title="1230.915" id=c_"1230.915">__yeah__</span>. We were living in like a new suburb <span style="color:red" data-ts="1233.315" data-end_ts="1233.605" title="1233.315" id=c_"1233.315">__area__</span> in Bergen, that was built more or less at this time when the city grew from, being like of the old kind of city with, you know, houses in for the industrial workers. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1246.235" data-end_ts="1246.525" title="1246.235" id=c_"1246.235">__It's__</span> very close to sound, to suddenly be organized in a completely different way because, you know, everyone started to get cars and could travel for longer distances and the city could grow outwards. Right. So there's kind of a quiet neighborhood thing, which probably happened later in nor and the United States. And, you know, even if I was just a few years old than, it's like my very first memory is just sitting in the window and looking at the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1270.845" data-end_ts="1271.085" title="1270.845" id=c_"1270.845">__cast__</span> that is passing behind another building. And in one way I feel that, you know, I mean, that's the recording I'm doing now again, and again and again. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. Yeah. Now, I'm curious about how it is that you got into composition and, and kind of rather late in your studies. I mean, did, were you like in music classes and stuff when you were a child? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Trond: </b>Yeah, I was, I started playing, I started playing, mandolin when I was seven years. Okay. Which is the instrument that, you know, I'm the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1307.645" data-end_ts="1307.885" title="1307.645" id=c_"1307.645">__best__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1307.985" data-end_ts="1308.205" title="1307.985" id=c_"1307.985">__at__</span>. And we've, we'd had a mandolin hanging on the wall because my mother wanted to learn the instrument when she was young, you know, and then it was just hanging on the wall, but it was very beautiful, you know, with this, you know, like, decoration, uhhuh <affirmative> on the body of it. Right. So I was very intrigued by that instrument, and I think, you know, I just, for as long as I remember, you know, I just always knew that I was going to play the Mangolin at some point. So I started taking mandolin lesson when I was seven, and I also started playing piano. And later on I was playing in the brass band for a while. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Trond: </b>And then in my teens I was playing in a punk band for a short while <laugh>, which is, you know, I mean, I think there were two things I learned from that. One is that that's where I started, you know, creating music myself. And the other thing was also that, you know, it don't need to be, I mean, even if a lot of the things I do now are technically complicated, and in one way I think, you know, my <span style="color:red" data-ts="1361.045" data-end_ts="1361.245" title="1361.045" id=c_"1361.045">__works__</span> always, at least to myself, end up feeling very simple, very minimalist in a way. And Right. Whether technology part of it is also quite hidden for the audience. I mean, it's not, I don't feel a need to show off what I'm doing technologically speaking to the audience. I mean, it's really, they are just means a very important means for <span style="color:red" data-ts="1380.805" data-end_ts="1380.965" title="1380.805" id=c_"1380.805">__you__</span>, but means towards getting to the kind of expression and the kind of situation that I wanted to invite the audience into. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, it's interesting that, that the, the punk thing would've had that kind of influence on you. 'cause it was very influential to me as well. Yeah. And for me, it was that the thing that I learned from doing and working on, on punk music was this sense that, there are no rules. You know? So prior to that, I had studied like song form and I had studied, you know, a lot of things, and I'd always tried to move work into, you know, within the parameters of those rules. And then I started, working with, punks. I was a recording engineer at the time. I started working with punks. And really quickly, it was sort of like, there are no rules, try everything. And that was really liberating to me, you <span style="color:red" data-ts="1435.285" data-end_ts="1435.485" title="1435.285" id=c_"1435.285">__know__</span>? But yeah. I find it interesting that one of the people that was influential to you was Brian Eno. Because in addition to doing really interesting work, he talks about his work and he's introspective about his work in a way that a lot of musicians aren't. Mm-Hmm. And I'm wondering, to what extent were you influenced by his writing and his speaking as much as his, recordings? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Trond: </b>A lot. A lot. I think, I know I've read everything. I could come across <laugh> that he's ever, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1473.865" data-end_ts="1474.085" title="1473.865" id=c_"1473.865">__any__</span> interview that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1474.835" data-end_ts="1475.125" title="1474.835" id=c_"1474.835">__I've__</span> come across, Uhhuh <affirmative>, I think, and I think you <span style="color:red" data-ts="1477.325" data-end_ts="1477.445" title="1477.325" id=c_"1477.325">__know__</span>, mean, his, his thinking has, influenced me in two ways. I mean, one is that I'm influenced by a lot or, or have, you know, and have considered a lot of his IDs. And I think, you know, what's so lovely about his <span style="color:red" data-ts="1489.945" data-end_ts="1490.165" title="1489.945" id=c_"1489.945">__IDs__</span> is that in a similar way to John Cage, they're not like the IDs that explain his music, and then it's Don, they are, they're kind of like, no, there are places to, you know, to, to take off from and go in many other directions. They're opening up a lot of things, you know, way more than he's able to explore in his own lifetime. So, so, so <span style="color:red" data-ts="1512.445" data-end_ts="1512.725" title="1512.445" id=c_"1512.445">__that__</span> kind of like, no, they are, they are inviting a lot of creativity, I think. So that's one thing. But I think the other thing that also that I've taken away from him is also this, the value and the importance of not just doing stuff, but also continuously reflecting on what you're doing and trying to use your intellectual capacity as yet another talent that might you push further towards where you dream of going, or where your <span style="color:red" data-ts="1543.335" data-end_ts="1543.685" title="1543.335" id=c_"1543.335">__sense__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1543.685" data-end_ts="1543.965" title="1543.685" id=c_"1543.685">__that__</span> it might be interesting and possible to go. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Yeah. It's, it's almost like he describes paths instead of giving answers a lot of times, which is, which is pretty wonderful. Wonderful. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1556.385" data-end_ts="1556.605" title="1556.385" id=c_"1556.385">__It__</span>, of all of his, of all of Eno's work, what is the thing that influenced you the most? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Trond: </b>That's, that's, gotta be like a second track on the first, ambient track <span style="color:red" data-ts="1568.765" data-end_ts="1568.925" title="1568.765" id=c_"1568.765">__on__</span>, music for airports, Uhhuh <affirmative>. And I think that is a gun. There's some things about it. I mean, it's one, one thing is that it's such clear example of the idea of the ambient listening. But the second thing is also that it's, it's based on very simple principles. It's just a number of tape loops with one voice, singing one note and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1595.285" data-end_ts="1595.565" title="1595.285" id=c_"1595.285">__then__</span> silence before the repeats. But because, because the pitch is different between the voices and all the loops are different lengths, you get like this tapestry where the different threads are combining in avenue patterns. Right. And, and I think that's, that's when I started with Max, I think, you know, at a point where I realized that this was probably the program that I would be working a lot on for the rest of my life. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1624.345" data-end_ts="1624.565" title="1624.345" id=c_"1624.345">__It__</span> was very early on when I was going through the tutorials in a very systematical way. And, and at some point, I think, you know, I made a very simple patch with a toggle, a metro object, and then a button. And then I just started a toggle and just saw this one blink, and then I copied all of it next to it and just changed the number of the metro. And when you do that like five, seven times, you basically have the compositional structure of that piece by him. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Trond: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1654.505" data-end_ts="1654.725" title="1654.505" id=c_"1654.505">__And__</span>, and I think, you know, I mean, that fascinated me for a number of reasons. I mean, one of them is that it helped me. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1663.265" data-end_ts="1663.485" title="1663.265" id=c_"1663.265">__It__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1663.685" data-end_ts="1663.885" title="1663.685" id=c_"1663.685">__<inaudible>__</span> was the first time I saw a problem to the thing that was like my biggest problem, or like a real deep crisis as a composition study student. And I was that whenever I saw a timeline, I didn't know what to do with it. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I was, you know, which came down to my mentality. It was like, I felt that a lot of this composition approaches, which are about like development of material, you know, really is like, you know, it, it's not where you are that's important, it's how you're moving somewhere else. But for me, you know, if I found a place that I found very interesting, I just wanted to stay there. But the timeline is always encouraging and narrative <span style="color:red" data-ts="1701.505" data-end_ts="1701.725" title="1701.505" id=c_"1701.505">__and__</span> move forward. It's always somewhere else that is the goal. And that really matters than the place where you are right now. And, and with this very simple max patch, I just saw a very different way of approaching it that was not like the horizontal along the timeline, but just looking at it from above and thinking of distribution <span style="color:red" data-ts="1722.605" data-end_ts="1722.805" title="1722.605" id=c_"1722.605">__as__</span> time as something that has to do with density, rather than with like this narrative, this, this story, this plan. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that's actually really interesting because you hit on something. I'd never thought of it that way, but that is actually one of the things that I find really intimidating about working on, like, recording music for myself. That when there's something about the second that it becomes laid out on a timeline, it's almost like a, a new level of stress comes along. And I've always kind of tried to figure out what is it that I find stressful or disturbing about that? I think you hit on something, which is that the timeline focuses on, on moving, moving to the next place rather than embracing the one you have. That's why I've always preferred performance to recording, because in performance, there's no timeline, or at least I don't, I don't have one <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Trond: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1781.995" data-end_ts="1782.285" title="1781.995" id=c_"1781.995">__Well__</span>, I, I mean, I, I, I mean, it's clear that there's lots of composers that managed to work with the timeline, you know, while not sticking with the narrative. I mean, right. So, so I mean, but I mean, I mean, for me being, you know, fairly new to composition, I mean, that was like a problem I was facing at the time. And, and I still, but I, but I still think that it's like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1801.485" data-end_ts="1801.685" title="1801.485" id=c_"1801.485">__no__</span>, between this linear narrative form and this focus on state and timber, you know? Right. They are two very different mindsets. Right. And I think, you know, I'm very much geared for the second one. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. One of the things you talked about was in your move from, you know, in your studies moving into composition, you talk about people that were supportive and were helpful in that move. And I'm always curious about the people that influence us, or the people that help us move in the directions that we, you know, maybe we were meant to head. Can you tell me a little bit about those people and, and how they actually influenced your move <span style="color:red" data-ts="1846.565" data-end_ts="1846.845" title="1846.565" id=c_"1846.565">__into__</span> composition? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Trond: </b>Yeah, I mean, I've been very lucky to meet many people, you know, over the years that have been functioning like that. But it's like, I was not necessarily encouraged, you know, to do <laugh> to, to, to move career wise in the direction that I have from home. I mean, I, I was very good at, math and stuff like that at school. So since I think my parents, you know, saw me, you know, moving towards a kind of like academic, career of some kind, you know, in mats or something. But I was, I was really, really deeply, involved, you know, conflict, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1880.785" data-end_ts="1881.005" title="1880.785" id=c_"1880.785">__no__</span> music meant a lot to me. And I was also very introvert as a young person, you know, had difficulties <span style="color:red" data-ts="1890.025" data-end_ts="1890.445" title="1890.025" id=c_"1890.025">__during__</span> the kind of conversations we are doing now, for instance. Sure. There were a lot of things that I was carrying that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1896.445" data-end_ts="1896.565" title="1896.445" id=c_"1896.445">__I__</span> was very, you know, had difficulties expressing to anyone else. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Trond: </b>But it's like the music was, for me, a different kind of language, a non-verbal language where when I listened to what others did, you know, the music of others, it resonated and, you know, got to places in me that nothing else could get to. And the same when I was doing music myself, I was also feeling that I was expressing parts of myself that, that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1922.625" data-end_ts="1922.845" title="1922.625" id=c_"1922.625">__the__</span>, you know, that I didn't have any other channel for at the time. So, so that my dream was to work on music. I mean, that was definitely like a dream, but it was also very much for some reason, you know, something I thought of as a utopian dream. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Trond: </b>But, but I was very fortunate that, so at some point, you know, with the mandolin, I was taking, taking up lessons after not having taken lessons in the teens. And, and, I was starting taking lessons from a viola player in <span style="color:red" data-ts="1951.365" data-end_ts="1951.485" title="1951.365" id=c_"1951.365">__the__</span> local, symphony Orchestra Bergen. And he was like, really kind. I was coming home to him for several hours, once a week. And, you know, we would be playing and he would be tutoring, you know, like a really long, long, giving me a really long license. And then we would have a long lunch, and then we would continue. And he never charged for it, you know, which I think was just like remarkably generous, to do. And, and he was a really good musician. And also some, someone who took music deeply, seriously. So say, I learned a lot from many layers, anything from technique to how you think about music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Trond: </b>And also had another friend, a folk musician from New Zealand <span style="color:red" data-ts="1993.355" data-end_ts="1993.645" title="1993.355" id=c_"1993.355">__that__</span> lived in Bergen repaired instruments that I got to know when I bought a new mandolin. And then he invited me home to him, in the weekend, you know, to play with him. And I ended up, you know, getting to his place and staying there every weekend, you know, for several year. And we would just be sitting several musicians in the ring for six, seven hours a day and just play and play and play and play pubs. And, and I mean, that was an adventure for me. And of course, something, you know, that gave me like an opportunity to really develop. Right. And then at the same time, I also started reading music theory because I really wanted, I was thinking that you probably can't take a music education as a mandolin player, but I was very interested in the compo composition of music. So, so I started reading theory and then got accepted into the conservatory, as a composer. But I think those people in particular do <span style="color:red" data-ts="2049.225" data-end_ts="2049.445" title="2049.225" id=c_"2049.225">__the__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2049.545" data-end_ts="2049.765" title="2049.545" id=c_"2049.545">__the__</span>, the two of them, I wouldn't be where we're today, you know, if it wasn't for them. They were really crucial, you know, at the time where I decided to go from their natural science to music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Going from there, as you become a more accomplished, composer and musician and performer, you talk about how you do a lot of work in collaboration with people. Mm-Hmm. And this is something that resonates with me. I find that I am able to complete work more readily when I'm working with someone and collaborating with someone. And, but you know, in your case, you've done collaborations with, with Visualists, visual artists, with, with people doing more traditional fine arts work and stuff like that. But you're also doing collaboration on like the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2102.205" data-end_ts="2102.365" title="2102.205" id=c_"2102.205">__jam__</span> project and stuff like this. Tell me a little bit about why you choose to focus a lot on collaborations and what it is that you get from them that's important to you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Trond: </b>Hmm. I think I just enjoy it so much. It's, but it's also, I was living in a meia for two years, came along with my wife and we were living in a very small fishing village. Very few spoke English, and I didn't work myself <span style="color:red" data-ts="2133.325" data-end_ts="2133.605" title="2133.325" id=c_"2133.325">__there__</span>, so it was very difficult for me to get into the community. So it was basically living in for two years, you know, speaking to very few. But my wife and my then 2-year-old, kids, and I just realized, you know, that that was too lonely for me. <laugh>. So like, like being an artist and being at working alone at the studio day after day simply won't work for me. You know, I would only get depressed, I think. But it's like when I've worked with someone else, I find, you know, that it's just both, you know, from just like, you know, as a human being, you know, I enjoy it a lot. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Trond: </b>And, and I really <span style="color:red" data-ts="2169.605" data-end_ts="2169.965" title="2169.605" id=c_"2169.605">__enjoyed__</span> a sense of being able to mean something to someone else and help them realize what they are doing and, and, and seeing what they're doing, getting to know what they're doing, and like, you know, getting a deep understanding of it and also being able to bounce ideas and materials back and forth, the whole social play of it. And, and I think, I mean, maybe <span style="color:red" data-ts="2192.845" data-end_ts="2193.205" title="2192.845" id=c_"2192.845">__there's__</span> this idea that composers should be like this one person genius, and the same goes for fine artist. But I think, you know, anyone that has played in band know, know that, you know, if you're play in a band, you know, that really <span style="color:red" data-ts="2204.705" data-end_ts="2204.925" title="2204.705" id=c_"2204.705">__is__</span> a group thing. And, and, you know, working as a group is a very natural thing to do. Right. And I think, you know, most other settings also, you know, you work with a group of other people looking at, you know, how most monkeys behave, you know, I mean, they are living in groups. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Trond: </b>They're not living, alone. So I think, you know, this is really deeply ingrained in our nature as the kind of animal we are. We are, you know, we want to belong to a group. So one of the things I enjoy, for instance, from the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2236.685" data-end_ts="2236.885" title="2236.685" id=c_"2236.685">__Oma__</span> development is that, is that, you know, the bouncing of ideas. 'cause I might have my ideas and my way of thinking that, you know, how I should do it. But then in particular, in the first years of the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2248.485" data-end_ts="2248.605" title="2248.485" id=c_"2248.485">__jam__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2248.605" data-end_ts="2248.765" title="2248.605" id=c_"2248.605">__moment__</span> development, whenever someone new came on board the project, they would sort of like review and criticize the project in a way where we had to redesign everything. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But it was such an interesting process every time, and it got way better that way. I mean, it took us 10 year, you know, to finally say that, okay, we will call this a one oh release <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Trond: </b>Right, right. But it's, you know, apart from, you know, producing a piece of, so, you know, so some, some, some Max Library that, that has been very useful to myself. It's also been such a pleasure, interesting, and a nice journey as well. You know, both like the intellectual challenge and stimulation you get from the other developer, which I think, you know, they're all really, really talented and brilliant people. And it's also, you know, a very strong friendship, between us, I think. And we've been lucky to meet every now and then, most often in Albi in France where, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2307.405" data-end_ts="2307.605" title="2307.405" id=c_"2307.405">__which__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2307.605" data-end_ts="2307.805" title="2307.605" id=c_"2307.605">__is__</span> a really beautiful place with fantastic food and fantastic wine. So, so like the development has not just been a question of, you know, solving some problem, but it's, it's been much, much more than that. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, and I enjoyed it enormously. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. Now, you kind of talked before about having been kind of a shy person, but you don't seem all that shy anymore. No. You're, you're involved in a lot of interaction with a lot of people. Yeah. How did you break out of the shyness? 
</p>

<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, I see. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Trond: </b>Yeah. But, no, no, I got, I think I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2346.205" data-end_ts="2346.365" title="2346.205" id=c_"2346.205">__kind__</span> got to a point, I got to a point, you know, where I saw that I had to do something about myself. So, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2351.885" data-end_ts="2352.005" title="2351.885" id=c_"2351.885">__I__</span> mean, one of the things is that in Norway you are, you know, you have to do military service, but, but if you are like a pacifist, you know, you can do a civil service instead. So I did that and I thought that, you know, some of the people that <span style="color:red" data-ts="2363.525" data-end_ts="2363.725" title="2363.525" id=c_"2363.525">__are__</span> able to be, or was able to be around at the time were kids. So, so I worked <span style="color:red" data-ts="2368.185" data-end_ts="2368.405" title="2368.185" id=c_"2368.185">__at__</span> a kindergarten and I think, you know, that was one of the, one of several things that really helped me. And I had like some years where I was spending most of the day just sitting at the cafe discussing the meaning of life. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, which is something I still enjoy doing. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, awesome. Well, boy, we've already kind of burned through the time. I can't believe that we Mm-Hmm. Believe that we spun through that. I wanna jump to the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2392.585" data-end_ts="2392.805" title="2392.585" id=c_"2392.585">__jam__</span> thing a little bit more. One of the things that I notice is that the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2397.745" data-end_ts="2397.965" title="2397.745" id=c_"2397.745">__Jam__</span> project, it, it seems to require sort of like a commitment to enter it. I think that it, it's an opinionated system. It sort of like has a way that you need to approach it. And, when people do, they seem to really embrace it and do well with it. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, what are the means that, how do you think is the best way for people who'd like to get into <span style="color:red" data-ts="2423.905" data-end_ts="2424.125" title="2423.905" id=c_"2423.905">__Jam__</span> to do that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Trond: </b>I think we've, we <span style="color:red" data-ts="2429.405" data-end_ts="2429.485" title="2429.405" id=c_"2429.405">__have__</span> not by far been as good at documenting it as we should have been. And it's like, one of the things I really had hoped that I would've had the time to do already is to make a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2438.645" data-end_ts="2438.845" title="2438.645" id=c_"2438.645">__series__</span> Screencast that might make it easier to access, you know, to, to learn how it's working. I hope I get the time to do that later this spring, but I just see the calendar filling up <laugh>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2453.395" data-end_ts="2453.685" title="2453.395" id=c_"2453.395">__Yeah__</span>. But, but I think for the time being, you know, if anyone's interested in checking it out, you know, don't hesitate mailing us. And we do have, if you go to the website, there's a mailing list, for users, you know, with a link at the bottom of the website, signing up for that and asking for help, is probably one way of doing it because I think, you know, either you need to attend some kind of workshop where we would be presenting it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Trond: </b>And I mean, I would be more than happy to, to do that kind of workshops, you know, if someone would like to invite for that, anywhere. But, but you know, eventually, you know, I really hope that we get the time to document the system a bit better than we have so far. 'cause I think, you know, if you're gonna start it, don't do it two weeks before the final deadline. <laugh>, you know, do do it at some point where, have a bit of time in between two projects and where you can explore it and test it out and don't have to use it immediately. And maybe not even have to decide whether you're gonna use it or not immediately, but, you know, to let it sink in for a while and then think of it. And, and I think, I mean, for some projects it might be really useful and there are the projects that are small enough that I don't really need it myself for them. So I don't always use it myself. It depend on the project. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2536.235" data-end_ts="2536.525" title="2536.235" id=c_"2536.235">__Sean__</span>, that's, this has been a fantastic opportunity to talk and get, caught up with you and learn a little bit about your background. Mm-Hmm, <affirmative>. As one final question, one of the things I like to ask people is, to provide some advice. If you were to run into the 18-year-old version of yourself and you were going to provide some, suggestions or information and advice, what do you think, what would that advice be? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Trond: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2565.985" data-end_ts="2566.205" title="2565.985" id=c_"2565.985">__Ooh__</span>, I, I think probably, I mean, I would spend, I mean, rather than just coming up with like a very short advice, I think probably what I would try to do, if, if someone has sensed, you know, that <span style="color:red" data-ts="2575.765" data-end_ts="2575.965" title="2575.765" id=c_"2575.765">__that__</span> potential, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2577.585" data-end_ts="2577.805" title="2577.585" id=c_"2577.585">__was__</span>, would be to spend a bit of time to spend a bit of time with 'em, to try to understand where they are and try to help seeing some of their potential and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2589.825" data-end_ts="2590.025" title="2589.825" id=c_"2589.825">__then__</span>, you know, suggests for them to pursue some of that. And more than anything, encourage them. I think, you know, when you're young, you need, you need encouragement. I think, you know, most of us are probably in different ways, you know, insecure, you know, even if we don't admit it to anyone else, we are insecure. And, and I find that insecurity, that's one of the worst things, worst things that can happen in terms of creativity. It's like when you don't think too critically, you know, you don't think <span style="color:red" data-ts="2618.705" data-end_ts="2618.865" title="2618.705" id=c_"2618.705">__that__</span> much, that it's really great what you're doing and you don't think that it's really bad what you're doing and you don't think that you're really talented <span style="color:red" data-ts="2624.685" data-end_ts="2624.905" title="2624.685" id=c_"2624.685">__and__</span> you don't think that you are not able to work with this at all, but you're just engaged with what you do. I think that's where you are, you know, doing the interesting stuff. So, so encouragement I think, you know, is the one thing I would try to push. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, Tran, thank you so much. That's very inspiring words. Thanks so much for spending the time talking to us and, I hope we get a chance, to meet again soon and to talk a little more. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Trond: </b>Yeah, same here. Alright. Thanks to us. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2654.025" data-end_ts="2654.265" title="2654.025" id=c_"2654.025">__Well__</span>, all 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Thank you. Goodbye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, many thanks again to Tron for his time and for spending time chatting with us. If you haven't checked out the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2669.745" data-end_ts="2669.865" title="2669.745" id=c_"2669.745">__Jam__</span> project, please do. It's available in the package manager and Max. Otherwise, you can go over to jam.org and check out the work that they're doing. With that, I want to thank you, the listeners for keeping on tuning in, for all the people I've met recently that said that they've been listening, I really appreciate it. Especially those of you who ran into me at the, the Denver Boulder synth meetup. It was really cool to check in with a bunch of listeners. So thank you so much, and I'm signing off. I'll catch you next week. Bye.
