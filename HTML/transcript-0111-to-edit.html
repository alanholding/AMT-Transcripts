<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. This week, I am going to talk to someone who feels like an old friend. His name is Julian Bale and he was actually, interviewed in podcast number 17. So now here we are at number 111, and, I just, I wanted to catch up with him now. He and I have actually interacted since that podcast. I interviewed him for the Cycling 74 website as kind of an artist focus. And one of the things that came up as part of that is that since I had talked to him in the podcast, he had been in the middle of some massive changes in how he does his work and some of his perspectives on work. And so I wanted to touch base Julian again, talk a little bit about his current performance practice, some of the things that he sees for the future, and in particular, some of the modular concepts that he's got kind of rattling around in his head. So, with that, let's say hello to Julian Bale. Julian, how are you today? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Julien Bayle: </b>Hello. I'm fine, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thank you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Julien: </b>So much. I'm busy, but 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Hi. Yeah, thank you so much for, this kind of a early in the day podcast for me. I know it's kind of in the middle of a busy time for you, but thanks a lot for taking the time for our chat. Yeah. Let's start off by talking a little bit about what your performance and installation work has been recently. Tell me a little bit about some of the work you've been doing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Julien: </b>So I, I designed <span style="color:red" data-ts="107.555" data-end_ts="107.675" title="107.555" id=c_"107.555">__a__</span> live performance named Alpha. I played a lot, previous year. And, this was for me a very interesting, live performance concept because, this was the first, the first one on which I worked at the same time for visuals and music and sounds. So usually, I used to, to work with my sound at first and then to design visuals because I felt these two different matter, I mean, visual and sound like very, like the same object I wanted to, to design and to build the performance with them at, at the same time, at the creation time. I mean, sure, it was quite <span style="color:red" data-ts="159.795" data-end_ts="159.915" title="159.795" id=c_"159.795">__a__</span>, quite interesting to work like that because, I, I think Alpha was, still is a very, I could say dense, matter. I mean, the density of Alpha can come from this way of creation. I, I guess so this is, I, I I, I really enjoy to perform it a lot of time from <span style="color:red" data-ts="184.445" data-end_ts="184.565" title="184.445" id=c_"184.445">__a__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="184.565" data-end_ts="184.885" title="184.565" id=c_"184.565">__electro__</span> festival to, yeah, I played it, about 10 times. I also showed some work in, London more related to my, my ways of, visual visualizing sound, by using, different visuals. So yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Now, when you're performing and doing both sound and visuals in performance, are you actually doing live sound creation at the same time that you're doing visual creation, or is some of it pre-rendered, or how does, gimme a little more info about, how you're actually working. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Julien: </b>I could say, I, I designed a visual system able to analyze the audio signals, in real time. So, I didn't want to use any piece of footages or, video samples. So everything <span style="color:red" data-ts="243.065" data-end_ts="243.285" title="243.065" id=c_"243.065">__it__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="243.865" data-end_ts="244.085" title="243.865" id=c_"243.865">__ran__</span> rendered at, real. So I'm using jitter for, for that, I mean, max seven for that. My system is building, some strange, I would say abstract structures and, everything is render in real time depending on the audio signals, generated, at the moment. So, no, I, I don't use any, any pre <span style="color:red" data-ts="272.885" data-end_ts="273.285" title="272.885" id=c_"272.885">__rendered__</span> stuff. This is a very simple system, but with a lot of, I would say input to control it. And, I can really change, change it a lot. I mean, in the visual, visually speaking, everything is generated at, at real time. So it gives also, to me, a way to introduce chance and, random stuff. I mean, this is like a constraint chance, if you know what I mean. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Julien: </b>I, I, I, I had some decisions where, while I was, designing it, but I wanted to, to, to let some, room to evolve, as it would like to evolve, you know, <laugh> Sure. Like a partner. <span style="color:red" data-ts="323.805" data-end_ts="323.925" title="323.805" id=c_"323.805">__I__</span>, I would say like a band. I mean, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Now, one of the things you use a very interesting phrase about developing your, developing your performance system, and that that is, you talk about designing, and that kind of implies some interesting things. It means that you're thinking more than just programming or developing. You're actually, you know, when you, when you talk about designing a performance system, it really does seem like there's more artistic intent than just technology. Can you talk a little bit more about what that looks like? What do you go through when you're designing a performance system? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Julien: </b>I, I had some pictures in mind related to, I would say, maybe architecture, basic, plans, map of, related to architecture like, building maps or something like that. And, it, <span style="color:red" data-ts="384.205" data-end_ts="384.405" title="384.205" id=c_"384.205">__it__</span>, it gives me some, I would say some ideas about how I could design a system able to each time to build a new structure, even impossible structures, like, we can see in, in alpha. I, I was interested by, having a set of points, I would say, and, with the same, this, this basic set of points, how could I, draw lines between them on different ways? At some points, I, <span style="color:red" data-ts="419.805" data-end_ts="419.925" title="419.805" id=c_"419.805">__I__</span> can use, a basic set of points and, I can draw lines between them, distort lines, change coordinates or the way of my coordinates are interpreted. This is all about technology. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Julien: </b>I know when I Right, I talk about that. But, I, I had, the idea of generating a lot of maps and a lot of, the word in <span style="color:red" data-ts="447.125" data-end_ts="447.365" title="447.125" id=c_"447.125">__France__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="447.365" data-end_ts="447.565" title="447.365" id=c_"447.365">__is__</span>, plans, like building plants. And I am quite, I would say, influenced by, brutalist, architecture <laugh>. Okay. <span style="color:red" data-ts="459.085" data-end_ts="459.205" title="459.085" id=c_"459.085">__And__</span> like <span style="color:red" data-ts="459.565" data-end_ts="460.085" title="459.565" id=c_"459.565">__<inaudible>__</span> and, architects like that, right. So I, I think this is what we can see in alpha, because alpha is like, every time and generating new structures, new material, and, processes on matrices of dots, like erosion, you know? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, like you have a concrete, concrete material that can be, eroded by, other algorithms. And, finally by, by the sound itself. So I think alpha is like, a real, <span style="color:red" data-ts="494.965" data-end_ts="495.085" title="494.965" id=c_"494.965">__a__</span> a very tight, an intent, very an intention, very tight with the architectures and sounds, you know, like sounds changing architectures and, sure opposites. Yeah, I, I think this is, this was my first, my first intent at the beginning. And it, it is quite confirmed because I, I'm going more, doing field recording and stuff like that in the space and in a concrete architecture. So, yeah, I think this is <span style="color:red" data-ts="523.325" data-end_ts="523.445" title="523.325" id=c_"523.325">__a__</span>, I would say the, the path, my path. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that's really interesting because, you know, sort of the idea of thinking in terms of maps instead of, you know, images that really does kind of open up some different ways of managing and manipulating the data. That sounds actually pretty interesting. Now, what do you use for, what do you use for the sound input into this? Do you, are you using something like Ableton Live or using hardware? What are you using for the sound part of this? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Julien: </b>Actually, for Alpha, I only used, synthesized sound, but inside my computer, I, I, I, I still didn't have, my modular system, so I was only designing stuff using Max through Max <span style="color:red" data-ts="576.485" data-end_ts="576.645" title="576.485" id=c_"576.485">__for__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="576.645" data-end_ts="576.845" title="576.645" id=c_"576.645">__live__</span> inside the <span style="color:red" data-ts="577.605" data-end_ts="577.925" title="577.605" id=c_"577.605">__Bolton__</span> Live. Oh, okay. Or, yeah. So the input of the sound is only synthesized sounds and, very strongly, sometimes modd sounds and, stuff like that. So the input is, only coming from my, my computer <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, in a, in an environment like this, I am, I'm, I'm always curious, about this, and I'm gonna ask you, because I tend to ask everybody this same kind of question, which is, when you're performing live, one of the things that you want to do is you want <span style="color:red" data-ts="612.045" data-end_ts="612.125" title="612.045" id=c_"612.045">__to__</span> balance, having things change and be interesting and not boring your audience, but you also want to make it be part of a whole presentation and part of an artistic statement. How, what do you do to balance those two things in a performance world? Because if you're generating all the sound and generating all the visuals, it can be easy to kind of fall in love with one thing, but if you do that for hours, it can be kind of boring. What do you do to mix things up? But when you're mixing them up, how do you keep them all in the same statement? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Julien: </b>Yeah, this is a difficult question because, I think we should ask this to the audience. Maybe <laugh>, <laugh>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="661.515" data-end_ts="661.635" title="661.515" id=c_"661.515">__I__</span>, I don't know, maybe, maybe, I don't know if Alpha maybe is boring at some. Sometimes the balance, this question about the balance could be also a question about, balance between writing things and changing things on stage. I think this is, a bit the same, the same idea. So, I decided to have some pretty, some, quite written structures because I wanted them to be like that. And, I'm trying to make them evolving on stage, but actually there is a parts which is, I would say written, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="705.265" data-end_ts="705.555" title="705.265" id=c_"705.265">__this__</span> part maybe is not, a part related to notes or to, I would say automations, but, this is more, a context 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Like pre, a predefined idea. Anyway, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Julien: </b>I have a predefined idea, <span style="color:red" data-ts="721.645" data-end_ts="721.765" title="721.645" id=c_"721.645">__a__</span> predefined context, and this, in this context, things can happen. I would say a bit like this, a bit like that. And then I can make them, evolving, on my own way, on stage with a lot of room for, I would say, it can be called improvisation. So yeah, this, so this balance decide a bit when I started to design my system, because I, I, I really have to ask myself what I wanted to build and what I wanted to do on stage and what, could be what, what the thing could be written, which things could be written or, yeah, I don't know if I answer. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>No, I think that I, I think that's actually a, an interesting approach because what it sounds like then is you're putting together a system that has directions. You, you decide on a, a general direction. You don't design on decide exact steps. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Julien: </b>Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Interesting. And of course, you have to choose a place of the cursor for that, so you have to choose the right balance, but I think it depends on what you <span style="color:red" data-ts="797.925" data-end_ts="798.005" title="797.925" id=c_"797.925">__are__</span>, what you have in mind. So yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Well, just if it helps you. I've talked to a couple of people that have seen your Alpha performance, and nobody suggested it was boring, so, <laugh> Okay. I think you're in good shape there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Julien: </b>Nice. Quite nice feedback. So yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, there you go. Fine. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Julien: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So let's talk a little bit about, your move into modular. This is something that came up when I interviewed you for the Cycling 74 site. You had gotten, started getting into modular hardware, but you also were starting to think of your software development in modular terms. It seemed like the modular concept started kind of taking over your brain. Tell me a little bit about what caused that to get started and kind of where you are now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Julien: </b>I, I think, I wanted to be, I would say, a bit challenged, by a new, a new approach. And, when I started to use some small parts of modular synthesizer, I was really fascinated by the way of, I would say composing building. I would say literally building music by building patches. This is some something I already did, before using <span style="color:red" data-ts="879.705" data-end_ts="879.925" title="879.705" id=c_"879.705">__Max__</span>. But, really, at the beginning challenge by the way, of composing a lot of tracks at the beginning with software, I was like, I want to make a, a song, a track. Let's, let's put this on the side and yeah, I want to start another one, et cetera, et cetera. And, this was more like a parallel creative process. Actually, I didn't really finish a track, you know, and this is quite basic, but, by using modular synthesizer, I have to let the patch as it is, at some point if I want to keep my, all my parameters, all the same and related to part particular tracks. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Julien: </b>So, this is really, really challenging. And, actually yesterday I was, still discussing with a very good friend and, about all these processes, and I was like, yeah, I'm not comfortable yet, but <laugh> and, yeah, actually. But I think in this kind of, un uncomfortable place or zone, this is the, the right place to be, to be creative, I would say. And actually, I, I have, we, we can use modular synthesizer on, billions of different ways, but, I, I'm starting to be a bit more creative by using this because, each, each element, each signals can modulate or can be listened by, by the system. So I have really the, the feeling of, each signal can be controlled. <span style="color:red" data-ts="993.125" data-end_ts="993.245" title="993.125" id=c_"993.125">__I__</span> like, can control something else, can be listened. Everything is <span style="color:red" data-ts="997.845" data-end_ts="998.005" title="997.845" id=c_"997.845">__the__</span>, is the same matter, I would say, right. Electrical pulse. And I, I like this idea because I felt that with Max, because each element in the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1008.925" data-end_ts="1009.325" title="1008.925" id=c_"1008.925">__inside__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1009.385" data-end_ts="1009.605" title="1009.385" id=c_"1009.385">__the__</span>, my computer can be data, can be video, or Right. How 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Fed into any other system, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Julien: </b>Yeah. Yeah. So I would say, I really, I didn't even talk about the sound of, of, the modular synthesizer <laugh>. I really like this, this sound. Sometimes it's very, very, I would say not, not perfect in, in the sense of, I would say noise level and stuff like that. But I, I think my, my, my system have, really its own soul, you know, <laugh>, right? So I, I really like to, to start the day patching, by doing something on my, with my modular <span style="color:red" data-ts="1052.965" data-end_ts="1053.125" title="1052.965" id=c_"1052.965">__in__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1053.125" data-end_ts="1053.445" title="1053.125" id=c_"1053.125">__sizer__</span>, starting a patch, and, letting it, evolving almost the day, I would say, it already happened. I started a patcher in the morning working on some something else and trying to, to see, and to listen to it evolving all <span style="color:red" data-ts="1071.125" data-end_ts="1071.445" title="1071.125" id=c_"1071.125">__today__</span>, you know? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> with, and, I think this is really, really interesting to, to, to see it like a, a real system. You can disturb, you can change and you can, yeah. Maybe with its own life, you know, it's a bit, yeah, it is very, very interesting. I'm still not comfortable to record it and to use it with, to sample it with and use it after with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1099.155" data-end_ts="1099.645" title="1099.155" id=c_"1099.155">__Ableton__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1099.645" data-end_ts="1099.845" title="1099.645" id=c_"1099.645">__Live__</span>, but I start to, yeah. I start to have some, some elements, some ideas about how I will do that in a close future. So this is good <laugh>. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>In, in a way, two of the things you talk about are almost in competition. On one hand, you talk about really liking the way that the system and a patch will evolve over the course of a day. And some of that is because you can set up a lot of modulations and it'll just constantly be changing. But also some of that is because the analog circuitry in a modular system will just sort of change over the course of time as well. You know, oscillators will go out of tune or envelopes, you know, as things heat up envelopes might start reacting differently or whatever. So that's, that's kind of one interesting angle of modular, but it also runs in opposition to the idea of, you know, setting up a patch and then turning the system off and coming the next day and having the patch sound the same. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So there's sort of like you talked before in visuals about kind of like, you know, a degrading or a, what was the word you use? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Julien: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1181.205" data-end_ts="1181.325" title="1181.205" id=c_"1181.205">__Ero__</span> Erosion. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1182.085" data-end_ts="1182.285" title="1182.085" id=c_"1182.085">__And__</span> erosion of the visuals. It seems like the modular, because of its analog circuitry has a certain amount of erosion built into it as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Julien: </b>Yeah, maybe it is, I would say, similarity. I didn't even know myself, so yeah, maybe, maybe I'm, I'm still like, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1203.185" data-end_ts="1203.405" title="1203.185" id=c_"1203.185">__wa__</span> like when, when I was working only with computer, and sometimes I'd like to have a lot of, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1210.465" data-end_ts="1210.885" title="1210.465" id=c_"1210.465">__memory__</span> inside my modular system in order to recall parameters and stuff like that, I started by drawing. I think, we are, we are a lot of people doing that drawing patches or maybe make, making pictures. But I would, I would say, I, I don't want to be able, now, I don't want to be able to recall patch, you know? Right. So when I, when I work, with one day, maybe with a patch, I want to record the sound, say that day or maybe the day, after. And as you said, very well, the sound could be the same, but not each time <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Julien: </b>Right. So, but I, I like this way of, creating because, it's, it brings me further in my own creation before having that, machines, these machines, in my studio, I was like, yeah, I want to control everything, you know, <laugh>, I want to control a lot of parameters. And, I don't really, I didn't really feel comfortable because we cannot, even if we want to do that, we cannot control each parameter. So, I was like, I want to design, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1291.865" data-end_ts="1292.085" title="1291.865" id=c_"1291.865">__not__</span>, not composing a track. You know, I want to, to design the system, able to, to, yeah, maybe to react to make a lot of track. But now I'm more, I would say, more focused on the track itself. So if I decide to compose a track by composing, I would say it, it can be everything. You know, I could use sequencer or I could, u use a master clock or not, you know, but when I decide to compose a track, I want to work on that track, not on a system able to build 10 tracks, you know, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Julien: </b>Right, right. I wanna be, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1329.185" data-end_ts="1329.405" title="1329.185" id=c_"1329.185">__so__</span> I think it comes, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1332.035" data-end_ts="1332.325" title="1332.035" id=c_"1332.035">__this__</span>, this new step in my creation process, comes with, the idea of, I would say releasing more, more stuff. <laugh>, actually, I was more in the flow of, making only live performances. And now I really want to write, you know, <laugh> like to, I would say, to, to write this, in CDs or I don't know, in print printing my own visuals. And I, I'm really in that, that new step of my creation life, I would say, you know? So I want to, to, to be focused on particular track and not the, the one, not the next one, not the one before. You know, I want to, to really find new sounds for that track. And, I'm more focused on it. This is quite challenging, but at the same time, I think, my work could be more, I, I feel that I, I am digging deeper in my own, yeah. More my own way of expression. So yeah, I'm quite happy with that, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That actually, that makes a lot of sense to me, because I too have been going, going in a similar direction. I have always, up to this point, I've always very much preferred doing live performance to making, you know, we'd call it making artifacts, whether it's recordings or prints or whatever, because with live performance, in a way, you can sort of like be uncomfortable with the thing and kind of ride that wave, and that becomes part of the risky nature of a, of a performance, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Julien: </b>Yeah. <laugh>. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But when you're doing, when you're doing a recording, for example, you have the opportunity to obsess over it and kind of go a little crazy. And that tends, for me, that has tended in the past for me to not be a very comfortable place at all. And now, and some of it is because of the modular and modular systems, and some of it is because, I personally am doing more things with visuals, which is kind of exciting me into doing music again, or doing, like, recording music again. And I think that's, I think that's fun. I think that's great. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1479.625" data-end_ts="1479.845" title="1479.625" id=c_"1479.625">__The__</span>, the question I have for you, because it's such a problem for me, is how do you get over obsessing? Now, one of the things you talk about is kind of wanting to be of the moment, right? Kind of almost like zen-like saying, I'm working on this track, not every track. How do you, what do you do to prevent yourself from getting overly obsessive about making each track perfect? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Julien: </b>Actually, this is, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1508.005" data-end_ts="1508.205" title="1508.005" id=c_"1508.005">__can__</span>, I, I couldn't really answer to this question because I, I'm still in the, yeah. I want to, to, to find, would say the, the right sound, at the right moment for my own, which is quite subjective, my own, feeling. So, I would say the, the, the, the thing that can stop me to explore and to say, yes, now I have a nice matter and I can assemble it using my dough on my computer, or just letting it like that. I, I think this is, because, I'm, I'm representing it in my head, like, like an evolution in the time. I mean, I have, some patterns, running, playing in my modular system, and at some point I want to, to fix them in, in a timeline, you know? And, I think this is, the, the at, at this moment, I can stop to explore. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Julien: </b>And I think, the track is, is finished, you know? Sure. But actually, this is a bit paradox, but it comes from this new step in this new, I would say, method or this new way of creation comes at the same moment when, I think I, I, I'm now assuming totally to be obsessed by attraction <laugh>. At the beginning I was like, yeah, I don't, I don't want to dig too much because it will bring, it'll bring me, too much, far from the other tracks, you know, now I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1616.845" data-end_ts="1616.925" title="1616.845" id=c_"1616.845">__can__</span>, I can't really dig one track very, very deeper, you know? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, because I assume that I think my, my work, I would say I, I feel like if I was, expressing myself better, I think I'm feeling comfortable in that way. Okay. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Do you think, do you think that there's also some amount of that that comes from the fact that working with modulars and working with kind of uncontrollable systems and having to record them at that moment, do you think that that also sort of helps you stay focused on a single track because you can't set something up and come back to it six months later? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Julien: </b>Yeah, actually it means, this is like when, when I was playing music with my friends, when I was younger, we, we was, we were, writing our notes and our music. So this was just something about, memories. So I feel a bit like that we, we are here at that moment. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1688.315" data-end_ts="1688.605" title="1688.315" id=c_"1688.315">__What__</span>, what could be the best way to write this moment in memory? The best idea would wouldn't be to be able to recall the memory, but only to, just to read it like, an interpretation, you know? If I can recall all my parameters, it's like if I, I would say run that moment again, but Right. Actually, we, this is not possible. Even if we can dream about that <laugh>. Right. I would say it's like using a photography and, looking at <span style="color:red" data-ts="1725.435" data-end_ts="1725.595" title="1725.435" id=c_"1725.435">__the__</span> photography or maybe designing the 3D models of the moment, you know? Right. You can, we can, we can have all the feelings, actually. So. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and it also, I mean, in a way, you actually used the word that I think makes a lot of sense in this case, which is the idea of, of a dream. I mean, if you think of a dream as being a memory that's not exactly correct, that actually kind of implies some of the things you're talking about. Where if, if you have exact recall of a moment, sometimes it's not as good as dreaming about the moment, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Julien: </b>Actually. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, I wanna talk about where you're going. One of the things I've always enjoyed about, about talking with you is that you, in addition to the work that you're doing now, you always seem to be casting out into the future, kind of planning what the next things that you're gonna work on are. And I always like kind of picking your brain to see where you're going. What do you, what do you have planned for the future? What kind of projects are you working on for the future? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Julien: </b>Actually, I, I have, I would say, 3, 2, 2 or three main projects. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1801.175" data-end_ts="1801.295" title="1801.175" id=c_"1801.175">__I__</span>, I'm working on a project related to the sound <span style="color:red" data-ts="1805.215" data-end_ts="1805.775" title="1805.215" id=c_"1805.215">__spreaded__</span> in, spaces. Another, I would say challenge for me because I, I don't, I didn't make a lot of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1814.535" data-end_ts="1814.735" title="1814.535" id=c_"1814.535">__film__</span> recording in the, in the past, so it can be hard for me. But, I really want to design some specific sounds, sounds specifically made for a particular architecture. And, I'm, working with, a research lab in France named, LMR for mechanical and, acoustic lab, which, which is a very nice research lab and very famous. And I, I'm working with them because, they help me to, I would say, to, to know better which sound could be berating more in that specific space or in this other one, you know? And, my, this project is about, how the sound can change, I would say a room or, how, how <span style="color:red" data-ts="1869.995" data-end_ts="1870.215" title="1869.995" id=c_"1869.995">__the__</span>, how a sound can change, a space and, on the other way, how the space can change the sound. I am spreading it inside, you know? I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>See. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Julien: </b>And, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1883.235" data-end_ts="1883.455" title="1883.235" id=c_"1883.235">__thi__</span> this idea is not quite, I, I wouldn't <laugh> I shouldn't say that, but this is not a really new idea. But, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1892.475" data-end_ts="1892.695" title="1892.475" id=c_"1892.475">__the__</span>, what I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1894.415" data-end_ts="1894.655" title="1894.415" id=c_"1894.415">__want__</span>, what I am trying to do is to design the right sound for the right place, and I want to, to, use the color of the space, how space can color the sounds, you know? So I, I, I am, I'm still looking for the better places to do this project. I think a long <span style="color:red" data-ts="1913.535" data-end_ts="1913.695" title="1913.535" id=c_"1913.535">__term__</span> project I need to go to a space to record sound and, then to use that to make a, a track, you know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Track. Yeah. So you're talking about like, like site specific, sound art. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Julien: </b>The, the idea at the, at the beginning was only to make a, a release, you know? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, like, maybe 10 places, 10 track. Oh, I see. Right. And, but, I, I'd really like to maybe make the opposite and make a installations these places, so it could be also challenging the audience by, sending some Im impulse based sounds, you know, like those we can use for, mod modeling reverb Sure. You know, with impulse response and stuff like that. So I, I'd like to make an installation, related to that. And obviously it'll cross at some point concrete buildings and, brutalist architectures. Right, right. Actually, I'm, I'm quite very interested by, by this kind of matter. So maybe the sound will be designed specifically with that in mind, and Sure. Yeah. So this is, this is one of my main projects, and yeah, I, I have another one more related to re radio signals and, antennas and stuff like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Julien: </b>And maybe my next live performance will be related to that. It would be, I would say, something like audiovisual, a bit like, the same setup like alpha, you know, but using, a lot of, matter recorded by, recorded through antennas and, maybe using some kind of strange atmospheric, radiation, so I don't know, data set or stuff like that to trigger the modular and to record it. And yeah, I, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2028.975" data-end_ts="2029.135" title="2028.975" id=c_"2028.975">__have__</span> that, yeah, would say obsession for signals and specifically for radio signals. You know, I think this is quite, I would would say intimate, like very personal because my, my father is a radiometer, so yeah, I, I was like, my first steps in my life were between, all these quarts and, strange <laugh> radio, emitters and receivers. So yeah, maybe I'm quite relative with that. And this's also all about transmissions and sharing, sharing, I would say signals. So yeah, I'm quite, interested, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2067.715" data-end_ts="2067.935" title="2067.715" id=c_"2067.715">__but__</span> that, I think we can do a lot of, work with that on a very low level and physical, physically speaking, we can listen pulsion in deference and trying to, scale up. Even failure on the wire, you know, <laugh>, I'm quite interested <span style="color:red" data-ts="2086.795" data-end_ts="2087.015" title="2086.795" id=c_"2086.795">__by__</span> that. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. And it's interesting that you have, you know, it kind of also hearkens back to your, your childhood and your interaction with your father. That's, that's really interesting. So our time is about up, it always goes so fast. I I never know where the time went. But before we go, one of the things that, I started doing after our last interview was talking to people about, you know, in different ways, how would they, how would they provide information to, the new generation? And sometimes I say it like, what would you say to a 18-year-old version of yourself? Or sometimes they say, you know, what, how would you, how, how would you mentor somebody that was trying to become a, a sound or visual or performing artist? And I'm curious to hear what you think, what, what do you think is the thing that a new artist could do to most quickly, improve or influence their work in a positive way? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Julien: </b>Yeah, I think you kept the, the <laugh> the more tricky question for the end of the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2158.995" data-end_ts="2159.155" title="2158.995" id=c_"2158.995">__end__</span> of this conversation. <laugh>. Yeah. Which is nice. <laugh>. Yeah. But I would say I, I was talking about with a, with a friend, bit before today about exploration and exploring you, I would say new fields. What I was saying to my students at the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2179.595" data-end_ts="2179.795" title="2179.595" id=c_"2179.595">__high__</span> school here when I was teaching was about, they, they, they don't have to be, we don't have to be, afraid of exploring, new fields because, sometimes I, I can hear a lot of people saying, yeah, when you are exploring a new field, you have to know everything about that field. And we have to be, like, expert before exploring. You know, it means you have to, to to know, all the theories about that and then to practice. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Julien: </b>And, I feel absolutely the opposite way, <laugh>, you know, I think we have to explore a lot without, this idea of knowing everything about the field. So, because if we have to wait for knowing everything about the field, I think we can lose some, I would say some feelings. When you start to explore something, you can have a lot of ideas. Absolutely. I would say personal and absolutely unique. Yeah. So I would say to my, yeah, even to my, to my children, you know, that, yeah, absolutely go, go to explore a lot of things. Then if you want to dig further and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2255.525" data-end_ts="2255.875" title="2255.525" id=c_"2255.525">__steer__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2255.875" data-end_ts="2256.155" title="2255.875" id=c_"2255.875">__with__</span> or stuff like that, you can, you can read, read a lot, and you can find somes who wrote about that. You can also have your own small pieces of theories, but I think theory should, should come a bit later. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Julien: </b>You know, we have to, to, to dig to and to explore <span style="color:red" data-ts="2278.255" data-end_ts="2278.475" title="2278.255" id=c_"2278.255">__by__</span> ourselves without being influenced at the beginning. I think this is really important. This is also a, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2286.115" data-end_ts="2286.235" title="2286.115" id=c_"2286.115">__a__</span>, I would say a way to be maybe more sure about what we want to do, right? Because this make us digging very deeper. But actually this is not quite simple. I mean, sometimes this is hard for me to, to, to dig deeper because, this is, yeah. Frightening or I don't know what, you know. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But I think this is quite very important for children and for, I would say for people in general. So I'm actually to, to make my, my word these days is making <laugh>, you know, I even, I even, write some post-its in my studio with the word fair, which means make to make making mm-Hmm. <affirmative> in French, you know? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, like fair, fair, fair. A bit everywhere, because this is, for me very, very important, you know? Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, Julianne, that, that's very inspiring. And, and that's, that probably launches us in preparation for the next time we talk because, that's, that's some wonderful advice. Our time is up. I want to thank you again for taking the time out of your busy schedule to talk to us, and I hope you have a great day today. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Julien: </b>Thank you very much. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright, see you later. Bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Julien: </b>Bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. I want to thank Julian for the great discussion. He's always got some great insights on working on new stuff and how you take ideas and turn 'em into artistic work. So it's always great fun to talk to 'em. I want to thank you, the listeners for hanging out, listening to my stuff, giving me the comments when you do, giving me the props on iTunes. It's been very helpful. And with that, I want to hang it up for the week. I'll catch you next time around. Thanks a lot. Bye.
