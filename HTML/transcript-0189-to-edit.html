<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, today I have the great pleasure of getting a chance to meet somebody new and you get to listen in on it. Her name is Kathy VanEck, or <span style="color:red" data-ts="19.255" data-end_ts="19.605" title="19.255" id=c_"19.255">__Kathy__</span> VanEck. She, pointed out it was a French name. So I'm gonna, I'm gonna try not to mangle names and, and, words too much. But, I will, still kind of like lean on the English ish pronunciation. So, we'll go with Kathy for the most part. But she is a fascinating person and she's doing some work that I think is critically important to, particularly academics and how it relates to sound. So with that, I will say hi to Kathy <span style="color:red" data-ts="50.665" data-end_ts="50.885" title="50.665" id=c_"50.665">__Van__</span>. Hello. Hi, how are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cathy van Eck: </b>Hi, Darwin. How are you? I'm fine, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thank you. And I'm sorry for, beating up on your name already, but, we'll <laugh> I'll do the best I can. Why don't we start off by having you explain a little bit about, your work and, what your, what you do? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cathy: </b>Yes, A composer and a sound artist, and I'm mainly working with electronics and with everyday objects and finding relationship between these electronics and everyday objects. And especially during the last years, I've been doing really a lot with microphones and loudspeakers in a kind of, well, what you could call low <span style="color:red" data-ts="102.075" data-end_ts="102.295" title="102.075" id=c_"102.075">__fee__</span> way. So trying out stuff with them and using them as musical instruments. And in that way I, I've also done some research on microphones and loudspeakers on how you can use them as sound objects themselves. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. To the point that you actually, I think you, it's actually an extension of your PhD thesis. You, you have published a book called, between air <span style="color:red" data-ts="127.815" data-end_ts="127.935" title="127.815" id=c_"127.815">__and__</span> Electricity Microphones and Loudspeakers as musical instruments. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cathy: </b>Yes. Right. Yeah. That's was my PhD research and then I, well made some changes and made it more readable and it became a book. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Fantastic. I think that that's just a really critical turn of events because <span style="color:red" data-ts="145.995" data-end_ts="146.215" title="145.995" id=c_"145.995">__it__</span>, it seems like both art and experimental music students have been pushed forward towards technology and towards using and abusing recording tools, but without any sort of curriculum in place. So it really is kind of a haphazard thing. In your, in your research work, what did you find that would be of particular benefit to people wanting to express themselves with sound art? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cathy: </b>Well, I think first of all, with microphones and blouse speakers, the good and easy thing is that, well, you, you are, are used to them already at home. You have, everybody has already <span style="color:red" data-ts="183.045" data-end_ts="183.165" title="183.045" id=c_"183.045">__a__</span>, a microphone and a loudspeaker in their computer or in their, their phone. So you have a, it's, you're very acquainted to these well instruments. So when you want to really them to become really musical instruments, you can do it well. There's already, feedback possible with two computers skyping with each other if you, let them approach. And that's actually a project two of my students did. They did a project with two Skyping computers, and then they approached each other with <span style="color:red" data-ts="211.965" data-end_ts="212.085" title="211.965" id=c_"211.965">__a__</span> computer and they started to feedback. And that's what I like about <span style="color:red" data-ts="216.865" data-end_ts="217.085" title="216.865" id=c_"216.865">__the__</span> working with microphones and loud speakers, is that there's a very easy approach towards them, but at the same time, you can do very complicated things with them because of course they, they can pick up and generate all kind of sounds. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. I mean, initially people kind of thought of speakers as a box that sat on a table and microphones are things that, that sat on a stand. But one of the things that sound <span style="color:red" data-ts="242.265" data-end_ts="242.485" title="242.265" id=c_"242.265">__art__</span> has explored is sort of the portability of these systems, right. Or taking them out of the context. So whether it's a, a swinging speaker or one of the things you did was put like shoulder <span style="color:red" data-ts="255.035" data-end_ts="255.525" title="255.035" id=c_"255.035">__mounted__</span> loudspeakers. I noticed that in one of your pieces, which was really interesting. If you take it out of the typical musical context, you actually have a pretty wide range of effects that you can create using that. 'cause they're sort of directional, but not completely. And similarly with microphones, you know, they can't, they can be directional, but not completely so and so there ends up being a lot of edges to work with, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cathy: </b>Yes, yes. And, and they're still also, they have this, what I call them, between air electricity that they have a materiality of, of themselves. So as soon as you touch the membrane of the loudspeaker, the sound will change. But they also can transport sounds and they diffuse sounds into the air, which seem to have no relation at all with the object, but with other objects. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, I'm curious, one of the things I like doing in my podcast is talking to people about their background and how they became the artists they are. And, I'm especially curious talking to people that identify as sound artists, because unlike say, being a sculptor or being a painter, you know, with a painter, it's like, I can be a watercolor painter or an oil painter, but everyone can visualize both what you do and what the end result is gonna look like. With a sound artist, it seems like in, in a way, it's more like being maybe something like a magician, right? Where you come up with your own ideas of what your art looks like, and then people can choose to either approach what you do or not. And so I'm curious how it is that you came to believe that that was how you were gonna express your artwork. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cathy: </b>Yes. I started with, well, with first of all, playing classical music instrument, but then I started to study composition and really traditional composition with instruments. And the school where I was, there was also an electronic studio, and it was kind of, well, you could go and have lessons in the electronic studio. And I started in a very old analog studio. <span style="color:red" data-ts="383.945" data-end_ts="384.165" title="383.945" id=c_"383.945">__It__</span> was the end of the nineties, so it was already over with analog equipment. But this teacher really believed in analog stuff. And I remember that I, I didn't understand anything about this. It, I was <laugh> there in the studio, but I was still curious about it for some reason. So I tried out a lot of stuff and, there was an Okta filter and, there was a folk holder and all kind of analog synthesizers, but I had no clue, really no clue what, what you could do with it. And this teacher thought that the intuitive approach would be quite good. So not too much knowledge about stuff, but just working in the studio and trying out stuff. So in the beginning, I just put everything to everything and, well, thankfully nothing broke, but <laugh>, it was 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Did he at least show you like the difference between inputs and outputs, or was it just up to you to figure it out? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cathy: </b>I think he, he showed me quite some more than I thought at that moment, but I just had no clue at all. So for me, it was already like, okay, why do you have a mixing desk when there is, I remember that the mixing, I was thinking, there are faders here to do the volume, and here, why would you do that, <laugh>, I was complete, but he was completely confident, like, oh, yes, but that's the right approaching. We'll, he will learn when you do. And then I started working there, and pretty soon I was really fascinated by the sounds you could make that you could really make sounds just there. And also that there was not a way that, that you could, well, you had to remember how you had done everything and all the cables, and you had to remember, okay, this is the <span style="color:red" data-ts="485.965" data-end_ts="486.245" title="485.965" id=c_"485.965">__sound__</span>, how I've done the song, and otherwise it was over, it was gone again, and you could look like, but if you had the <span style="color:red" data-ts="491.765" data-end_ts="491.885" title="491.765" id=c_"491.765">__for__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="491.885" data-end_ts="492.085" title="491.885" id=c_"491.885">__code__</span> a little bit different, it would sound completely different again. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cathy: </b>Then I started to, then they also offered <span style="color:red" data-ts="498.085" data-end_ts="498.365" title="498.085" id=c_"498.085">__then__</span> a lesson in doing music with computer, and that was the moment that I start to realize, oh, this is so much easier than cutting tape. But also this is so much more my way of thinking. And I, I heard, your last PO podcast with Tobias who, Tobias <span style="color:red" data-ts="517.925" data-end_ts="518.085" title="517.925" id=c_"517.925">__Rebar__</span> who talked about Max <span style="color:red" data-ts="519.805" data-end_ts="519.925" title="519.805" id=c_"519.805">__P__</span>, but actually that's also the software which got me into electronic music. Interesting. Because for me, MaxMSP and the idea to have, not a timeline, but just an interaction level where you can design stuff and say, if this happens, then this is the result, and if something else comes in, then this is the result. That was for me, really something which, which suddenly I realized, oh, with this I can work 'cause I'm interested in, in these kind of interaction levels. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure, sure. That makes a lot of sense. I, I wanna back up a little bit because you said something about working in the analog studio that I thought was really interesting. You said that there wasn't really, really an easy way to like store your work so that once the cables got pulled or the knobs got reset, that actual song sound was gone. And to me, that's one of the things that makes working in an analog studio seem to be a little more like performance art and a little less like typical digital art, right? <span style="color:red" data-ts="585.245" data-end_ts="585.445" title="585.245" id=c_"585.245">__Yes__</span>. When you're working with analog stuff, to a certain extent, once a a sound's been produced, you're never gonna actually be able to make that same sound again. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cathy: </b>Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes. It's, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And so how did that, how did that affect the way that you thought about sound? It seems like something like really captured your attention in terms of making sound, rather than, <span style="color:red" data-ts="605.025" data-end_ts="605.245" title="605.025" id=c_"605.025">__yes__</span>, A lot of people get access to a synthesizer or something, and the first thing they wanna do is make music, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cathy: </b>Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative>. But it seems like you got fascinated by sound and, you know, even when you talked about the pieces of the analog synthesizer that caught your attention, the vocoder or the Octave filter, you know, these are things that are sort of like sound sculpting tools. They aren't really musical tools per se. What is it about working with that that gave you a connection to sound as, as sort of your medium? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cathy: </b>Yes. I think I was quite, I was, of course, I, I was 18, 19, so it was the first time working with electronic sound at all, but the idea that you could, could create a sound and that it would, would be there without any musicians and, and well, just having your sound, which you made there in that moment. I think that was one of the, for me, a really, a moment of, of realizing that that was what I was interested in, in making connections, and then of course making also connections between the sounds. I have to say that afterwards, I didn't work in <span style="color:red" data-ts="673.425" data-end_ts="673.545" title="673.425" id=c_"673.425">__a__</span> electronic, in a analog studio anymore. I've never worked afterwards. It was one year more or less, and then I left the analog studio, and now I'm, nowadays I haven't, well, I'm sometimes touching an analog synthesizer, but that's more out of curiosity than any kind of <laugh>. I, I'm not, not working with them. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, let's talk about your work because you have ditched the analog synthesizer and instead you're using trees. There's, so I will just call it the piece with the trees. You can actually tell me what the actual name of it is, but where you have sort of like a sound actuated tree. What's the name of that piece again? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cathy: </b>It's, Raj, and it's Dutch for green Noise. Ah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Got it. Okay. So you're using that, you're using, you're using a variety of different tools. So it's like, it's like you ditched analog, you did some work in, in digital stuff, but you also went back sort of like physical manifestations of sound creation too. Right? There's, it seems like one of the things I'd say is the stuff I've seen of yours all, all has a very physical manifestation to the point that even your, your book, you know, it really is discussing sound making tools that have physicality, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cathy: </b>Right? Physicality. Yes, yes, that's true. I am interested in this connection between the, the physical and the non-physical, and for example, ra, the, there's this, well, I always call it small tree, but then people think I, I have a real small tree, and it in fact it's just, it's more like a plant and, this, this small plant, it's what, what I'm interested in, in is in connecting, playing the plant and connecting it to sounds, which, sometimes are directly coming from the plant, but sometimes there are also sounds which have in fact, no relation to the plant at all, except that I try to connect them in the piece with the plant. Like I play the small tree, the sev, several branches, <span style="color:red" data-ts="796.185" data-end_ts="796.405" title="796.185" id=c_"796.185">__if__</span> it's as if it's a harp Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And there are kind of, well, these are just, sign waves with an envelope and, and some refurb, and they're <span style="color:red" data-ts="805.325" data-end_ts="805.525" title="805.325" id=c_"805.325">__played__</span> like dinging, dinging, and then that's the sound of the tree then. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cathy: </b>And then during the piece, these sounds start to change. For example, I, I, sometimes I use contact microphones to trigger the <span style="color:red" data-ts="817.685" data-end_ts="817.885" title="817.685" id=c_"817.685">__sound__</span>, so to trigger the, the harp flings, but later on I just amplify the contact microphones immediately with okay, some filtering to not have very low frequencies <laugh>, but it should sound, it sounds much more like, oh, this could be the real tree. So I'm interested in this kind of sonic transitions, I would say, from the object. And what is, what, how can the object sound and how can it sound differently? And what does it do for us as a kind of development or a narrative in sound itself? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's actually a really an interesting thought because so often when we're working on pieces that use mic contact microphones and stuff, we have to listen to them just in order to hear what it's picking up so that we can like properly trans transduce it into something that's, you know, quote more mu more musical or more, more artistic. But a lot of times those sounds themselves have a pretty interesting nature to 'em as well. It's interesting that you'll, you'll actually use that as a transition to go from its sort of transduced state to its actual state. That's pretty, that's pretty cool. I want to ask you about a couple of things that I noticed that were, things that I saw in a number of your works. The first one is you have a tendency to sort of hide the performer in some of your work in, in different ways. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So in some, it's like very clearly done right? So, I think it's called song number three Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, where you have <span style="color:red" data-ts="914.285" data-end_ts="914.405" title="914.285" id=c_"914.285">__a__</span>, an obscured singer's face. Yeah. But in this, in this tree piece, the player is obscured behind the tree. And you're right, it's really more like a bush rather than a great big tree. But, you know, the players kind of obscured behind the bush. And even in your work, like, clang vera orang or hearing sirens, some of these where you, you have large format mobile speakers, you know, it, it obscures a significant part of the body. What is it, is that something that you're doing to try and release the viewer from getting attached to the performer, or is that just something that it just happens to be the easiest way to play the device? I'm just curious for myself. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cathy: </b>Well, I didn't start to do that on purpose, but I started to realize when I did quite some pieces where my face is hidden or where the, the body is playing, kind of <span style="color:red" data-ts="976.465" data-end_ts="976.825" title="976.465" id=c_"976.465">__neutral__</span> part, that, it is a kind of aesthetic. I used to, I think to amplify the gestural quality of the body itself and how this, that's related to the sound. So there's no expressive body in, in contrary to most music performance, when you perform, violin or when you perform guitar or when you perform keyboard, there's some kind of body movements going on, which are not sound producing in some way. And in my pieces, I try to reduce them as much as possible, so when I'm stand and also to reduce the, the expression of the performer themselves. So that's one of the reasons to hide the face a lot, because if I'm not smiling or if I'm not looking concentrated or anything like that, then, then it's becomes more like an object on stage, right? So the, the body is a kind of, something which is, can get a meaning in itself without being me. So it, it's also trying to get to be less personal. So it's quite, becoming a neutral body which moves. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Do you ever expect or hope that other artists or other performers might be able to do your pieces? Or do, or do you consider them really kind of like personal expressions? So it kind of comes with, you kind of come with the piece? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cathy: </b>Actually both. I think there's certain pieces, for example, song <span style="color:red" data-ts="1074.925" data-end_ts="1075.125" title="1074.925" id=c_"1074.925">__number__</span> three, which have been done now by other people, I made another version actually for them because I'm wearing it always with, it's just with, with quite pressed against my face due to construction. And I made a version for them where they can hold it in the hands and then move it, the loudspeaker, away from their face, so it's easier to perform. And also the, the <inaudible>, the bush piece has been done by other several times, so I'm fine with it. And I also, what I, I once had the problem myself that we did a piece here in <span style="color:red" data-ts="1113.245" data-end_ts="1113.445" title="1113.245" id=c_"1113.245">__Zurich__</span>, I'm not gonna say from which composer, but we had a problem with performing the piece because then they said, oh no, this is only allowed to be performed by one performer in the world, and all the others are not allowed to do this. And then I, I started to realize I actually don't want this for my pieces. My pieces are kind of open in this way, that when I do them, I do <span style="color:red" data-ts="1133.085" data-end_ts="1133.205" title="1133.085" id=c_"1133.085">__them__</span> in, in a certain way, but if someone else sees something else in it, they're completely welcome to try out, try this out and make it their pieces. So to say, in the sense that it's really an interpretation then, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. From a concept standpoint, you're almost like open sourcing the whole, the whole structure. That's interesting. Now, I would say that one, one of the things I find with your pieces when I go through, whether it's the, the video documentation or just the images and descriptions, is that they're very interesting tweaks of ideas that when you see 'em, at least for me, I see them and I'm like, oh, wow. And that would be so cool to do that, and it'd be neat to do it in this this way. See, what you're saying is you don't really mind if people take that as a launching point for doing their own, either their own version or their own work based off of that. Is that true? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cathy: </b>Yes. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1192.785" data-end_ts="1193.005" title="1192.785" id=c_"1192.785">__Yes__</span>. That's, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's, that's really cool because a lot of people try to be really careful and, and have a lot of ownership with their work <laugh>. So it seems kind of kind of nice to, to open the door because I, I found a lot of your, a lot of your things to be really, really interesting. I loved the one, wings where it's, it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1215.155" data-end_ts="1215.445" title="1215.155" id=c_"1215.155">__sort__</span> of like a, it's built to be a feedback system, and then you have performers moving baffles to change, change feedback characteristics. And very similarly, you know, you talk about, your students who did the dual Skyping laptops or whatever, these kind of movement <span style="color:red" data-ts="1235.775" data-end_ts="1236.125" title="1235.775" id=c_"1235.775">__based__</span> pieces seem to start playing around at the, at the intersection between sound, art and dance, right? Mm-Hmm, <affirmative>. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1244.965" data-end_ts="1245.125" title="1244.965" id=c_"1244.965">__because__</span> I've, I've worked with contemporary dancers in the past and they love this kind of stuff because then they're sort of affecting the sound, but there's still some intentionality behind the sound. Have you ever worked more specifically with, with movement oriented pieces, or have you always focused on the sound part of it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cathy: </b>I've always focused on the sound part. I have worked together with some choreographers, so they <span style="color:red" data-ts="1269.395" data-end_ts="1269.685" title="1269.395" id=c_"1269.395">__done__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1269.785" data-end_ts="1270.005" title="1269.785" id=c_"1269.785">__it__</span> really, the, the dance part. But my pieces are, most of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1274.565" data-end_ts="1274.645" title="1274.565" id=c_"1274.565">__them__</span> it's sound and, and all gestures are in fact nearly always directly related to making the sound. Right. So there's nearly no gesture. Like there's also nearly no object, which is not directly related to the sound. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? Yeah. Again, kind of getting away from the like performance waving around or grimacing or whatever, right. It's, yes. Yeah. That's very interesting. So with your book, you're talking about the microphone and loudspeaker as tools for musical creativity, but also it means that you have to talk about sort of the history of sound art, right? Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cathy: </b><affirmative>,

<b>Darwin: </b>First of all, how do you choose this? Is, this is an area that's fascinating to me. Again, i, I tried teaching and it was difficult because there isn't a lot of pedagogy, a a lot of solid pedagogy. There's a lot of work that's been done, but it's been difficult to determine exactly which pieces are the important ones and which are not, or which are useful from an academic standpoint, which are just nice pieces of art, you know? And sometimes, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1344.965" data-end_ts="1345.245" title="1344.965" id=c_"1344.965">__yeah__</span>, there are, there's a wide variety of sound art pieces that are very much tied to performance, you know, performance art. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> like, like action. But then there are also installation pieces, and then there are also like these public space pieces where you have a, you know, a howling grate system or you have airborne structures that make a special noise that in a site specific way. Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1371.315" data-end_ts="1371.605" title="1371.315" id=c_"1371.315">__Yeah__</span>. How did you choose, how did you go about choosing the things that were important for both your research and for introduction in the book? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cathy: </b>Well, first of all, I decided I was gonna focus mainly on performative stuff. So, well, what I would call things which are composed in the sense that they have a beginning and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1393.265" data-end_ts="1393.485" title="1393.265" id=c_"1393.265">__end__</span> and end. So all, there's nearly no gallery piece. There are perhaps one or two gallery pieces which came in because I thought, okay, but this has to be mentioned in some way, <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cathy: </b>And then, well, when I began, I just thought, oh, I'm gonna research this. So I, I didn't know how much there was going to be and how, so I thought, I, I'll just look for the most important works. And then I found out pretty soon exactly what you say, what is the problem? There's so much. And it sometimes something is important in, in one aspect, but it's not in another. And then at the certain moment I decided that I was going to look at how can microphones and loudspeakers interact in different way? How, how, what happens if you start to move them? What happens when you look how they can be prepared and how, can they be placed in space, et cetera. And that made that, I, I had a kind of then a list of, I would say playing techniques like with other musical instruments. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cathy: </b>And this list of playing techniques then had to be filled with examples. And these examples, well, sometimes I had one playing technique and I thought, oh, there're really tons of examples. So there, I just had to choose what, what is the example, which fits best. Or often it was also, okay, I have already had a piece of this composer, so let's choose a piece of another composer, or, often I also chose examples of which I had heard them myself, because it's so, so such a different, especially with microphones and loudspeakers doing weird stuff through loudspeakers. You really can't do your loudspeakers at home or in the studio. You can't reproduce what it is when it's done live on stage. Right. So that was how I then started to make choices and I wore things. For example, I was looking for feedback through materials itself, and it was very, very difficult to, find the piece. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cathy: </b>And then I found a piece by Nicholas Collins doing exactly this at one moment, while that's actually one of the options in the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1517.605" data-end_ts="1517.765" title="1517.605" id=c_"1517.605">__schools__</span>, like you can also do it like that <laugh>. And then I made a, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1521.245" data-end_ts="1521.365" title="1521.245" id=c_"1521.245">__a__</span>, a piece myself for music stands with, with small loudspeakers and contact microphones on the music stands where all the feedback is going through the metal to try out like, okay, what happens? And it was just a kind of, for me, kind of backing up to be sure that, that this was, valuable playing technique. So that's how I started to choose it. And then what I decided when I had finished the book, which was not the plan from the beginning, but it was then to continue with a block kind of thing where I, because I had some examples left where I tried to post every one or two weeks, it's called microphones and loudspeakers.com. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cathy: </b>And there I post an ex, quite a recent example, most of the time of someone doing interesting stuff without mentioning any of them, because in the book I mentioned categories and approaches, and I analyze it with a vocabulary I thought is appropriate to describe what is happening, what kind of playing technique is used. But on the block, it's, it's completely open without any words. You can't understand when you haven't read the book. So you can still read it, and it just gives descriptions of the piece. So it can also be used by students as, as other examples, and by it can also be used to analyze it yourself, like for students, like how can you analyze this 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. And make your own categories for them for 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cathy: </b>It as well, and make your own categories as well. Yes, of course. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, it's very interesting. One of the things I noticed is that you do a lot of things that are fairly portable, and in some cases extremely so. So with the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1619.135" data-end_ts="1619.485" title="1619.135" id=c_"1619.135">__claim__</span> vera or <span style="color:red" data-ts="1620.085" data-end_ts="1620.365" title="1620.085" id=c_"1620.085">__lung__</span> and hearing sirens and some of these others, you have these like shoulder <span style="color:red" data-ts="1626.835" data-end_ts="1627.325" title="1626.835" id=c_"1626.835">__mounted__</span> loud speakers and, and portable speakers actually really seem to be kind of at the heart of your work, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cathy: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>One of the things that that does is that allows you to, to perform or, or do these pieces in different locations. And, and the one that really caught my eye was in, I'll just call it clang so I don't have to stumble over that word very much, is in the clang piece. You start off showing yourself, performing it on stage, but then mm-hmm, <affirmative> short partway through the, through the documentation, all of a sudden you move out onto the street. And since this, since this, piece was specifically related to like sound ordinances in the city of Bern, is that That's right. Am am I right with 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cathy: </b>That? Yes, yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So it's specifically related to sound ordinances in burn, taking it out on the streets of burn seems like <laugh>, you know, a natural movement. But I think it's something that is difficult for a lot of artists to approach because things get really uncontrollable when you get out on the street, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cathy: </b>Yes. Yes. It, there's a lot of, I'm, I hustle. I have a ambivalent relationship to working outside. I'm doing it a lot. And there are nice aspects, but there are also aspects of, well, first of all, you have of course the noises of the street in that piece. It was really no problem, the noise of the street because it was about street noise and about, noise <span style="color:red" data-ts="1716.875" data-end_ts="1717.485" title="1716.875" id=c_"1716.875">__regularly__</span>, regulation laws. So there, it was really no problem at all to have some noise and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1724.085" data-end_ts="1724.325" title="1724.085" id=c_"1724.085">__burn__</span>, actually quite quiet. It's, there <span style="color:red" data-ts="1726.725" data-end_ts="1726.765" title="1726.725" id=c_"1726.725">__are__</span> not a lot of cars. And then there's of course the acoustics, but in this case, the acoustics were also, I knew the place and I did some research there. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="1736.555" data-end_ts="1736.845" title="1736.555" id=c_"1736.555">__Bern__</span> has this very nice, and part of the street is, is, covered and the part of the middle of the street, it's free, but the, the houses all have kind of, porches is kind of, okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cathy: </b>Roofs. So it's, it's, and this is acoustically completely different than in the middle of the street. And then, so you have nice different acoustic ways of reflections for the loudspeakers sound. So in that, especially at, at that place, it's, it's, acoustically really a rich environment. What is difficult, of course, is also the weather. And on, on the evening I performed, I'm always a, yes, it was snowing. I'm always afraid of rain, but <span style="color:red" data-ts="1779.525" data-end_ts="1779.725" title="1779.525" id=c_"1779.525">__there__</span> it was snowing <laugh>, and I, I hadn't thought about that at all for some reason, although it was December right. And, <laugh>, but it was also acoustically. It wasn't as bad as I was afraid for because snow can, of course, especially fresh snow, damp also quite a lot. But it didn't do that that much. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's definitely an interesting, it's, it's very seldom that you see documentation of an art piece that includes snow. So that was kind of, that was kind of an interesting addition. Now, finally, we're, our time is running out, but there's one question that I really is kind of at the heart of things as it relates to you and your, your work. Even when you defined yourself at the beginning of this call, you, you talked about being a composer and an artist that works with sound. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I'm wondering how closely those two are attached and how important it is for sound artists to also consider themselves composers, or if those two things could be detached in some way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cathy: </b>I think it could definitely be detached in the sense that there's certain sound <span style="color:red" data-ts="1848.355" data-end_ts="1848.645" title="1848.355" id=c_"1848.355">__arts__</span>, which is much more coming from fine arts, from painting in the way it's dealing with sound. And, for me, that the reason that I still say, so to say I'm, I'm a composer and sound artist, is because I, I am really interested in sound and especially in these kind <span style="color:red" data-ts="1866.885" data-end_ts="1866.965" title="1866.885" id=c_"1866.885">__of__</span> sonic transitions, which I meant at the beginning, like going from sound you recognize very well to going to, to abstract sounds, which are more coming from electronic music synthesizes and back to more clearly recognizable sounds. At the same time, I'm also interested in composing something with a beginning and, and an end. And I especially remark when I'm making installations, because I'm not doing that very often. I have two works, which I would say that are really insulation works, but they're both interactive and they both also, so they change during time because of the audience interacting with the insulation. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cathy: </b>And I think that makes it, for me, coming from a, a composition world where it's important to compose kind of narrative kind of development in, in con in contrary to sound <span style="color:red" data-ts="1920.275" data-end_ts="1920.565" title="1920.275" id=c_"1920.275">__arts__</span>, which really comes from a, perhaps even there, then there's the fine arts part, but there's also the performance art part of, of sound arts where it would be really doing a process like Steve <span style="color:red" data-ts="1932.925" data-end_ts="1933.165" title="1932.925" id=c_"1932.925">__Wright__</span> pen music would be then lesson, but it's really performs art. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="1936.725" data-end_ts="1936.885" title="1936.725" id=c_"1936.725">__so__</span> you do a process and you never say like, oh, this is not, it's not swinging that well, this microphone, I gave it another push. <laugh> would obviously be very wrong. And my, my work is more in really the composed situation first <span style="color:red" data-ts="1952.365" data-end_ts="1952.645" title="1952.365" id=c_"1952.365">__really__</span> sounds like <span style="color:red" data-ts="1953.125" data-end_ts="1953.325" title="1953.125" id=c_"1953.125">__then__</span> this, and then it goes on like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's a great way to pose it. And it makes sense because I, I guess in this, this goes back to this idea of the different kinds of sound art and how you can point to them. There's, there's a certain amount of it that's very much based off of like sculpture practice. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cathy: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yes. But, but yours definitely seems to be more on a performance art practice. And so the compositional thing, especially in terms of the narrative arc, it seems like the compositional background really has to put you in a, in good place. So you teach at the, at the university in burn, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cathy: </b>Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm curious, do you teach in the art department or in the music department? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cathy: </b>I teach in the music department, but our master is a called contemporary arts practice. Ah, okay. And there we are kind of interdisciplinary department because we have people teaching from fine arts, from literature, from performance art, and then from the sound arts right. Studies. So, and we often also mix this together. So it's, I have some students coming from, from a fine art background and some from literature background, which makes it very nice actually to see how they think about music and about sound and how, how this relates to one another. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well that's, that's kind of interesting because it does seem like sound art doesn't necessarily have a natural landing place in most academic situations. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So it's kind of good that you have a, you have a landing spot there, <laugh>. That sounds perfect. So Kathy, I wanna thank you so much for taking time out of your schedule to talk. Remind us again what is the website with your blog and with information about the book? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cathy: </b>That's microphones and loudspeakers.com. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, great. And the book was published by Bloomsbury, correct? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cathy: </b>Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. And you have a, a paperback version that's coming out next year. Is that gonna be, revised at all or is that just going to be a republishing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cathy: </b>It's just going to be a republishing and especially a cheaper republishing <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2081.685" data-end_ts="2081.965" title="2081.685" id=c_"2081.685">__Yeah__</span>. Well, with that, I want to say thank you for spending the time. It was really fascinating exploring this. I, I love talking to people that have a sound art practice because that's such an open-ended term. So it's great to hear what people are doing with it and I certainly hope that people check out your work. I found it fascinating and really inspiring. So I want to thank you for doing that great work as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cathy: </b>Thank you very much for the talk. It was really, really very nice. Alright, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It was a great time. And with that then, I will let you, let let you go on with your day. Have a good one. Goodbye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cathy: </b>Bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thanks again for Kathy, for spending the time talking with us about sound is kind of an art form instead of just a conveyor for music. It's really interesting and if you're into it at all, you're gonna want <span style="color:red" data-ts="2135.645" data-end_ts="2135.685" title="2135.645" id=c_"2135.645">__to__</span> check out that website. Thanks again for listening, for supporting, for sharing. Really appreciate it. The numbers and the podcast are really great and, I hope that we can continue doing this for a long time. Thanks again and we'll catch you later. Bye.
