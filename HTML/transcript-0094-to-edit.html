<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. This week I have a very special guest. His name is Richard Nichol, but you would probably really understand who he is if I say that. He's the Pittsburgh modular guy. Pittsburgh modulars are, kind of everywhere. I have a, I have a little foundation two system that I use when I'm teaching. A lot of people use 'em, as starter systems, but a lot of people are using them throughout their, throughout their rigs. They're super popular. And so with that, I wanna say hello to Richard. Hi, Richard. How are you today? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard Nicol: </b>Hello. I'm well, <span style="color:red" data-ts="45.955" data-end_ts="46.245" title="45.955" id=c_"45.955">__yeah__</span>, A good day at the shop today. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, fantastic. So, why don't we start off by having you tell people what, what you do, instead of me just calling you the Pittsburgh guy, you can kind of fill in the blanks of what it is that you, you actually do with, with the company. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b>Sure. Well, I, I'm the owner. I'm the founder of Pittsburgh Modular. I started the company three and a half years ago now, and we make mostly analog synthesizers. Everything is fully modular. So the idea was you take a synthesizer and you chop it up into its individual components, and that allows the user to sort of put it together in ways that maybe the designers and the engineers hadn't thought of. So it's really a great way to explore sound design and, come <span style="color:red" data-ts="96.245" data-end_ts="96.405" title="96.245" id=c_"96.245">__up__</span>, come up with something that's really uniquely you. So that was sort of the idea behind the company, really. It was just me kind of scratching my, itch as a creator. I wanted to do something interesting. I was a software developer for 15 years, and, staring at databases all day, I sort of, I got burned out. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b>And so I started fiddling with electronics as a hobby, and it sort of grew and grew. And I thought, well, if I can sell one or two of these things, maybe I could buy some another brand's module without spending a whole lot of my own money. And so I came up with a, a simple DIY module that I thought, okay, this is interesting enough someone might buy. So I called a couple dealers, I said, Hey, I've got this product, <span style="color:red" data-ts="145.785" data-end_ts="146.005" title="145.785" id=c_"145.785">__you__</span> know, or would you be interested in buying a couple to sell in your store? And right away, within the first week, I think I, I had 50 or 60 orders. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Wow. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b>So right out of the gate, yeah, right out of the gate, there was a ton of interest. And I was doing the stuff in my basement and working during the day doing databases, and then putting modules together at night. And it just sort of slowly grew from there to the point where I had taken over the entire basement of my house, <laugh>, and you could, could barely get downstairs to do laundry or anything. <span style="color:red" data-ts="178.585" data-end_ts="178.805" title="178.585" id=c_"178.585">__And__</span> at that point, so when we moved to the shop and, you know, I quit my day job and this became, three and a half years ago, this became a, a, a company. And now, you know, we have, it's been a while, but it was, it was an amazing day. The first day we get a, a paycheck that said Pittsburgh Modular on it, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Right. That's awesome. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b>But that was pretty cool. 'cause I, I'd never been, you know, making them was sort of the satisfaction. So it was cool to get paid to do it. But we, we've been doing this now for quite a while. We're at Pittsburgh modulars, we're the largest company in the United States making, these modular synthesizers. We have a very strong reputation. Our products <span style="color:red" data-ts="217.765" data-end_ts="218.005" title="217.765" id=c_"217.765">__sound__</span> amazing. And, you know, it's, I think it's because it's fun and we try to transmit a little bit of, bit of that fun in our products. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, I, I agree. You do a great job of that. The other thing that you do is you really help people get started, by creating these foundation systems. I think it's a really critical thing for people to say, I want to experiment, but I don't want to have to worry about getting the things right. You know? So by buying a foundation system, it's sort of like jump starts the process. They can begin their experimentation, then run from there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b>Oh, absolutely. Well, that, that was sort of the problem with modular synthesis in general, before we got into it, was that it's, it, it really draws you in as far as, wow, that looks really interesting. But it's, it's very overwhelming. If you would go and buy a system and you bring it home, you plug it in, you turn it on, it doesn't make any sound <laugh>, you know, you have to understand how the thing works. You have to know how to patch it up. And that, that's very overwhelming for someone that just spent a lot of money on this instrument that they have no idea how to play. So what we have done, and this was the philosophy from day one, was we need to get the barrier of entry down as low as possible. We need to make it as easy as possible for someone to buy a system and then start making music with it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b>So we do these fantastic manuals with patch examples, right. And explanations of what each module does, what every Jack does, and then a patch explaining each module. And they've, over the years, our manuals have gotten better and better because we are selling systems and not just individual modules. We can sort of curate the experience. So if I know what modules you have, because you're buying my system, I can then say, oh, try these 10 patches out. Right. To give you a real strong idea of how it works. And what that does is, you know, I know no one likes to use manuals, but in this case, I think it's sort of important. And if you give us a couple hours with our manual, you can take off your sort of learning hat and put your musician's hat back on and start making your own patches and start making your own music. And then, then you're no longer intimidated by the instrument. Instead, you are, you're excited to use it, and it's, it's gonna push you in ways that you've never gone before. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I think it's interesting that you talk about the manual as being really important, because most people, especially in the modular synthesizer world, treat it as if it's a, as if it doesn't need to exist. And the fact is, I think the reason a lot of people say they don't want to use manuals is because manuals have a history of either being, either being too basic or too, too complex. And it seems to me like you put the idea of making music ahead of the idea of showing off your modules. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b>Well, absolutely. Well, at, at that point, hopefully, you know, someone has either already bought our system, <laugh>. Yeah. Or, you know, they've invested the time to go to the website and download the manual, and we've already sort of hooked them at that point. Right. If, if they're interested enough to, even if they haven't bought anything and they're interested enough to download the manual, that's an opportunity for us to say, you know what, this is how we, this is how we operate. This is what is important to Pittsburgh Modular. And I think they're gonna get it and realize, okay, I, they're doing this in a way that makes sense. I'm gonna take the next step. You know, I'm gonna go out and listen to some demos, or I'm gonna go out, you know, and, and order one, <span style="color:red" data-ts="446.525" data-end_ts="446.645" title="446.525" id=c_"446.525">__a__</span>, a synthesizer or any music instrument for that matter, it has to sort of satisfy you visually and sort of mentally even before you would begin to make music on it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b>Right. So the manual helps satisfy your mind. It sort of puts you at ease with the instrument. But an instrument also has to be beautiful and easy to understand at the same time. Because if you're sitting in your studio or your home office or your bedroom and you're, you know, you have a couple hours to kill and you wanna play some music, you're gonna look around and you're probably gonna have two or three different instruments to choose from to take a peek at. Plus, you know, not including your laptop with all the virtual instruments and everything you can do on a laptop, you're gonna pick up the instrument that catches your eye. Right. You're gonna pick up the instrument that scratches that part of your brain, that you need scratched at that particular point in time. So even before you turn the thing on it, you have to feel comfortable around it, and you have to be drawn to it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b>So the manual is one aspect of that sort of getting you familiar and comfortable with the instrument. You know, the second part of that, that is, it has to be beautiful. We, we spent a lot of time even on just the ergonomics and how the thing looks and how each module we make, and we make close to 40 different modules. Right. Each one is different. Each one is unique in its layout and certainly what it does. But that's important because as you put these things together, you need to be able to say, I need to change the ADSR. Okay, it's gotta be this because this is the only one that could look like that <laugh>. And so once, so we're competing for the attention of people, you know, that have the internet and have five or 10 synthesizers already in their home. So if we can draw them, and then obviously once you turn it on, you start patching, it has to be an amazing instrument. It sort of has to knock you over with its sounds. Right. But even before you get to that point, there's a, there's a lot to go into it. And the manual is, is it's a, it's an important component because it really tells the world that, you know, we're in this, we're in this as a, as an experience, and not just to sell modular synthesizers. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that's, that's a great perspective, and I think it's one of the reasons why, why you're so successful. I mean, there's, there's a number of reasons, and we'll get into that a little bit more later. But one of the things I'm curious about, so you do all the design work for the modules as well as the manufacturer and sale, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b>Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. So I have a suspicion there's a lot of people listening to this podcast that probably have day jobs that are like looking at databases. How does a guy <span style="color:red" data-ts="618.045" data-end_ts="618.325" title="618.045" id=c_"618.045">__with__</span> who is doing that, where's the background that you have that allowed you to become a module maker or a manufacturer? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b>Well, my background is, I've, I've been a musician, you know, since junior high. And I've always been fascinated with synthesizers and how they sound, not necessarily how they were made, but certainly how they sounded. And as a software developer, I think working with coding and different programs, I was very easily able to transition to schematics and hardware because, you know, blocks of code, I can sit, I can think of them in the same way that I would think of an op-ed or a transistor or capacitor. And I was able to sort of shift my understanding of coding into, I would say a rudimentary understanding of hardware. Now, I, I'm not an electrical engineer, and I don't think that I'll ever be good enough to be a decent electrical engineer, but I, fortunately in Pittsburgh, there's a, a tremendous number of really smart people. And I was able to find an engineer, Michael Johnson, who was willing to work with me almost from day one. So I would come up with an idea, and I would sort of, as best I could, draw it out Sure. In a schematic, I would, I would call my, certainly my earlier schematics, I would, the coding perspective, it would be almost like pseudo code, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b>Where you use sort of very generic programming terms to describe what you want do. That's sort of what I did originally with the s schematics. I would kind of draw the schematics as I thought the signal flow should go. But it was, it was very rough. But I, I would sit down <span style="color:red" data-ts="739.845" data-end_ts="740.005" title="739.845" id=c_"739.845">__then__</span> with Michael Johnson and sort of flesh out the idea and he would kind of take it from there. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, because I had that understanding and the programming, <span style="color:red" data-ts="750.155" data-end_ts="750.445" title="750.155" id=c_"750.155">__it's__</span> sort of the processes, you know, one thing can happen at a time. Right. I think it, it gave me the ability to, to sort of shift gears. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's interesting because what you're talking about actually kind of has a, has a history or a recent history around it. There's actually a, a conference that, that some of, my coworkers go to, called Sketching and Hardware, where that concept of playing around with schematics and playing around with these things as if they're almost as if they're sort of proto software tools. And then once you come up with an idea of finding someone that can help you implement it in sort of like an industrial way, that's, that's becoming a really important part of how designs are created now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b>And as I, as I sort of get deeper and deeper into Pittsburgh module, where I realize, you know, there isn't one person out there that does everything. You know, there's no company that lives on an island and designs everything they make from scratch. It. There's no way you could be an expert at everything. So it's, I think you're, you have to understand the process enough to be able to ask the right questions and to be able to find the right people to work with. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Now, in, in cases where I've spoken to other modular builders, they've had influences, you know, either they were influenced by Bob Moog's work, or by Don KO's work, or by electro notes, or, you know, a lot of different, different influences. Who would you say was your primary influence in terms of circuit design? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b>Well, my biggest influence as far as circuit design goes, it's probably our engineer, Michael Johnson. Michael Johnson is an, an avant garde artist. He's been designing his own synthesizers for about 25 years. He, I think he got an Arp ax one year for Christmas or <span style="color:red" data-ts="878.225" data-end_ts="878.445" title="878.225" id=c_"878.225">__his__</span> birthday, and it just didn't do what he wanted it to do. He, he, he felt very constrained by it, very restricted as to what he could do. His, his family were all, engineers and physicists, and they encouraged him, well, you know, what, if <span style="color:red" data-ts="896.665" data-end_ts="896.885" title="896.665" id=c_"896.665">__it__</span> it doesn't do what you wanna do, then you know, why don't you try to build something that does what you wanna do? Right. So, as, as he, he grew up in a household where, you know, if you needed a tool to do something, you built the tool. So his designs are very unique. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b>And, he has a, he has a very interesting way of approaching problems that I think is very different than a lot of most synthesizer engineers. So from a hardware standpoint and a design standpoint, that's probably, you know, that's, that's where we come from. But from sort of a more of an East coast, Bob Mogue versus West Coast done <inaudible> sort of <span style="color:red" data-ts="939.305" data-end_ts="939.525" title="939.305" id=c_"939.305">__syn__</span> flavor. Right, right. Pittsburgh Modular is, is very firmly rooted <span style="color:red" data-ts="945.105" data-end_ts="945.325" title="945.105" id=c_"945.105">__an__</span> East Coast Bob Mogue side. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I, I prefer the idea of hooking up a meeting keyboard and playing the synthesizer in that way. Right. As opposed to sort of the more, the modular is the interface side of sort of the, the West coast on <inaudible> style. Right, right. So we we're definitely firmly rooted in the East Coast philosophy. But there's so many amazing engineers, and when you start to look at, not necessarily on the circuitry level, but when you sort of assess the ideas of, you know, Don <span style="color:red" data-ts="985.405" data-end_ts="985.725" title="985.405" id=c_"985.405">__<inaudible>__</span> and all the old great a stuff like the ARP 2,600, and, you know, Bob Mugs stuff, <span style="color:red" data-ts="993.585" data-end_ts="993.805" title="993.585" id=c_"993.585">__the__</span> earlier Bob Mugs stuff, and the Dave Smith stuff, you start to realize that in each one of these synths, there's always some, there's always something that's really unique and really great about it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b>So, you know, for the layman looking at synthesizers, say, oh, they're, they all sound the same and they all look the same. Well, they, I guess they kind of do <span style="color:red" data-ts="1014.165" data-end_ts="1014.325" title="1014.165" id=c_"1014.165">__in__</span> a, in a very broad sense. But when you start to get in there and see that, oh, Dave has this great filter and he has this great technology <span style="color:red" data-ts="1023.275" data-end_ts="1023.565" title="1023.275" id=c_"1023.275">__that__</span> he can do polyphony, where Moog is all monophonic, but Moog has this amazing Moog sound that they've been sort of refining over the last 50 years. Right. And you look at Don <span style="color:red" data-ts="1036.165" data-end_ts="1036.285" title="1036.165" id=c_"1036.165">__b__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1036.465" data-end_ts="1036.685" title="1036.465" id=c_"1036.465">__so__</span> it seems like he built, he lived his entire life in a bubble, and he built stuff that interested him. And it's so different and so unique, and you can sort of take little flavors from here and flavors from there and create something, that is, in our case, uniquely Pittsburgh. Sure. So we can sort of stand on the shoulder of these giants and do something that is uniquely us. Without, you know, the URAC community, a lot of people will, you know, there's a lot of very small manufacturers, and what they'll do is they'll have one or two modules that they, that they make, and that's great. But a lot of them are simply, you know, go to the internet and type in transistor ladder filter schematic. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b>And you put that on APCB, and now you have your first module. Right. And you're not really adding anything to the sum of human knowledge doing that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b>And that, that really doesn't interest us. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1091.325" data-end_ts="1091.605" title="1091.325" id=c_"1091.325">__Right__</span>. We wanna do something that we can be proud of that we did. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, and I would say one of the things that I find interesting about the Pittsburgh modules is that they, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1103.465" data-end_ts="1103.685" title="1103.465" id=c_"1103.465">__on__</span>, on the surface, they look like real solid, real straightforward East Coast style modules. Right. But as I work with 'em, each one of 'em seems to have their, like little idiosyncratic behaviors. Like, you know, something as simple as the LFO two, you know, it's got, there's two different speeds, and they can kind of, you know, you mix 'em together and you get some very interesting LFO interactions because of the dual nature of it. Those, those are some really interesting things. And it really is sort of like how you help people get from the most basic patches into stuff that's more interesting. I think that that's key. Now, my, I'm curious, you talk about how different manufacturers have things that set them apart in terms of, you know, the sonic quality or something. What would you say are the, the things that make Pittsburgh systems unique? What, what do you consider your shining stars? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b>Well, you can't, you can't go wrong with the filter module <laugh>, proudly called Filter <laugh> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1172.405" data-end_ts="1172.685" title="1172.405" id=c_"1172.405">__because__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b>We, we, we were truly hard on it and we only ever wanted to make one. It was really important that if we were <span style="color:red" data-ts="1181.365" data-end_ts="1181.525" title="1181.365" id=c_"1181.365">__gonna__</span> come out with a filter, that it would define what Pittsburgh sounded like. Right. And we weren't going to have six different types. So the filter that we came out with, it's a state variable filter. The state variable filters <span style="color:red" data-ts="1198.245" data-end_ts="1198.445" title="1198.245" id=c_"1198.245">__or__</span> architecture, the core architecture has been around for, long before synthesizers were around. It was used in testing equipment long before people decided it was cool if you ran, saw webs through it. But what we've added to it and what we've implemented around this core architecture really speaks to you as a musician. The filter is warm and creamy, and it's, we like the idea that there's no sweet spot that you can take the frequency knob and sweep the entire frequency range, and it all sounds good. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b>We added a custom resonance circuit that it won't start to self oscillate, but you can push it really, really hard to get this really great, almost sort of tweaky 3 0 3 vibe out of it, but also pull it back and just get cream all day long out of it. That said, it's sort of a Jekyll and Hyde, because you can flip the switch and go to oscillator mode where the residents then will self oscillate. And you have, you essentially have a sign wave oscillator that begins competing with the incoming signal to just get these fantastic overdriven tones. Where it ends up being almost whatever wave you put in it, you just get this brutal square wave of textures out of it. Right. So there's, but like you were saying, how all of our modules kind of have a second layer of functionality to them. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b>The filter certainly does as well. There's one switch that said the gain of one or the gain of Q switch, and it's, it's probably the least understood function of all of our modules. And really what it does is it changes the response of the resonance so that if you are, as you are increasing the resonance level, it will decrease or not decrease the overall amplitude of the output. So you can use that as, a resonance <span style="color:red" data-ts="1333.235" data-end_ts="1333.515" title="1333.235" id=c_"1333.235">__based__</span> VCA, you can do some really cool stuff, so like hitting it with an envelope, and do some interesting things you can't do with anything else. So we like to put in sort of sprinkle in these extra features on top of, you know, what the most important thing is sound quality and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1350.525" data-end_ts="1350.765" title="1350.525" id=c_"1350.525">__kind__</span>. And, and the filter really, I think shines through is, is one of, one of our best, best modules that really represents what Pittsburgh wants to be. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Yeah. Well, it's a, it's an amazing filter. And, and frankly, it's one of those things that I see that even people who, who aren't like dedicated to Pittsburgh modular systems, often will have the Pittsburgh filter in there because it is such a unique and beautiful sounding, part of the instrument. Now. Right. Now you, I, I want to talk a little bit about your current set of modules, because first of all, where you used to be doing things that were very solidly East Coast, you know, ADSR, envelopes, basic VCAs basic, V Cs a basic linear mixer. You've started branching out, I noticed that you now have AD ar envelope things your oscillators now are a little more complex. You have, you have some other like tool modules that are, that are providing a little more complexity. What's the drive behind that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Is it just so that you can provide people with lots of options or was it with some specific goals in mind? Because I would say that, some of the things, some of the early things that you did that really reminded me of West Coast work was sort of like the, the generator and the Gen Expander combo. I mean, that kind of had, I wouldn't even say West Coast, that was just idiosyncratic and weird and fun <laugh>. Right. It, so it strikes me that while you, you frame yourself as being kind of doing things firmly East Coast, you have the devil on your shoulder there somewhere where you're doing, doing a little crazy stuff too. Is there a, is there kind of a master plan behind that, or is it just something that you do because you love doing it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b>Well, there is a little bit of a master plan behind it, but a lot of it is just, you know, we make modules that we want to use. Right. And talking about the envelope modules is a great example for this. The envelope module is, based off a surge module called the, dual Slope Generator. There's been a lot of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1493.365" data-end_ts="1493.605" title="1493.365" id=c_"1493.365">__your__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1493.625" data-end_ts="1493.845" title="1493.625" id=c_"1493.625">__rec__</span> modules based off that design. The, the make noise maps <span style="color:red" data-ts="1498.265" data-end_ts="1498.485" title="1498.265" id=c_"1498.265">__was__</span> based off that design. And there's a bunch of other modules that, that almost clone component per component, the Surge dual slope generator. The functionality of the module though is great, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1512.165" data-end_ts="1512.445" title="1512.165" id=c_"1512.165">__surge__</span>, he came up with a great idea. That's very interesting. But like I said, we are, and it's a, it's an extremely West Coast idea. A <span style="color:red" data-ts="1522.565" data-end_ts="1522.765" title="1522.565" id=c_"1522.565">__third__</span>, a slope generator can essentially be a couple different things at one time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b>It can be an envelope generator, so it can be an attack decay or an attack release. But because you have voltage control can retrigger, what that means is you can also do oscillators with it because as soon as you hit the end of the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1540.055" data-end_ts="1540.405" title="1540.055" id=c_"1540.055">__decay__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1540.405" data-end_ts="1540.685" title="1540.405" id=c_"1540.405">__phase__</span>, then it just re-triggers the attack. So you essentially create oscillations with it and you could do some other stuff, like envelope following and that kind of stuff with it. We were just sort of fascinated by the functionality <span style="color:red" data-ts="1553.225" data-end_ts="1553.445" title="1553.225" id=c_"1553.225">__and__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1553.465" data-end_ts="1553.685" title="1553.465" id=c_"1553.465">__and__</span>, and how it worked. But like I said, because we are firmly rooted in the East coast, we wanted to put it within the context of the East Coast. So what we did was we took the functionality, we said, how can we package this? And how can we design a module that is sort of an East coast version of this? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So what we did was we kind of started from scratch and we said, well, okay, here's the points we want to hit. So we have the envelope so we can do an attack, decay, or attack lease, but in to bring it further <span style="color:red" data-ts="1589.945" data-end_ts="1590.165" title="1589.945" id=c_"1589.945">__on__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1590.165" data-end_ts="1590.325" title="1590.165" id=c_"1590.165">__these__</span>. 'cause then we said, well, let's add a sustained switch to it. So now you have a fully functioning envelope, a very East coast style envelope. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b>But you, but you have voltage control over the attack and you have voltage control over the release and the decay. So you can still, and you still have the cycle, so you can do the LFO stuff and the crazier West coast stuff. But it's also very at home in the East coast, more traditional keyboard <span style="color:red" data-ts="1621.325" data-end_ts="1621.545" title="1621.325" id=c_"1621.325">__set__</span>. Right. So we try to straddle both sides with modules like that. We're, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1627.105" data-end_ts="1627.265" title="1627.105" id=c_"1627.105">__what__</span> I like to say, we're bringing the best of the West <laugh> to <span style="color:red" data-ts="1631.575" data-end_ts="1631.865" title="1631.575" id=c_"1631.575">__each__</span> side and incorporating, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1634.545" data-end_ts="1634.665" title="1634.545" id=c_"1634.545">__that__</span>, and that's really what we're trying to do, certainly with the envelope module, with our new oscillators, the wave, it's called the wave forms. I came up with this, you know, in my infinite ability to break things, I was prototyping something and I came up with this fantastic mistake that ended up giving me this great wave from what we call the blade wave. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b>Which is a mod relatable saw wave. So you can modulate a saw wave almost in the same way that you can pulse with a square wave. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So you get this living, breathing saw. It's really great sounding, big beefy sounding saw wave, almost like a chorus vibe to it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b>And we wanted to incorporate that into our oscillator. Now our oscillators are a bit different than most people's. We don't calibrate our oscillators to a oscilloscope, because musicians don't play music to so <span style="color:red" data-ts="1696.385" data-end_ts="1696.625" title="1696.385" id=c_"1696.385">__script__</span>. So we always thought that was crazy. We have a sound that we go for and we calibrate our oscillators to that sound. So if you look at our side waves, our <span style="color:red" data-ts="1705.145" data-end_ts="1705.345" title="1705.145" id=c_"1705.145">__side__</span> waves are really ugly. Yeah. The bottoms are bigger than the tops and they're not really sign waves at all, but they sound, they sound huge. Right. And they, you know, they give you this massive bottom end. So the waveform oscillator, it's really still very east coast, but we've added a sub oscillator and we've added this blade wave that you can modulate <span style="color:red" data-ts="1728.065" data-end_ts="1728.185" title="1728.065" id=c_"1728.065">__it__</span> in really unique ways. So we've really just expanded East coast from the, the four or five basic waveforms to add some more flavors to 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It. I see. Sure. Okay. That makes sense. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b>And a lot of times it, certainly with a lot of those west coast, you know, style oscillators, really, it's just two oscillators and how they modulate each other. Right. So if you would take even two East coast style, you know, two of our waveforms put 'em in, just have one modulator <span style="color:red" data-ts="1756.865" data-end_ts="1757.025" title="1756.865" id=c_"1756.865">__and__</span> the other, you're gonna get sounds that are almost identical. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, I'll, I'll tell you, I have, in my primary performance rig, I have two of the original, Pittsburgh oscillators, but I had, my friend Chris Larky modify them to use 10 turn pots. And, which, you know, really makes it kind of fun from, you know, being able to do really long and slow sweeps that that are, but, but also to really fine tune quite easily. But, those two ended up actually replacing a make noise DPO for me because I found that, in fact, you know, just cross oscillating or cross modulating them gave me as wild as I needed to. But being able to do that fine tuning and, and frankly, I just, that is a sawtooth wave <span style="color:red" data-ts="1813.285" data-end_ts="1813.605" title="1813.285" id=c_"1813.285">__based__</span> oscillator, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b>It is. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I just, I find often that I really like the sound and the timur that comes from a saw <span style="color:red" data-ts="1823.805" data-end_ts="1824.045" title="1823.805" id=c_"1823.805">__based__</span> oscillator rather than a triangle. And so for me, it was sort of like I got a, I got an engine that sounded the way I liked, and just by being a little bit clever with my patching, I could get a lot of the stuff that I got out of this really straight west coast kind of oscillator. But I got it while still having an East Coast flavor as well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b>Sort of, you got the dirt and the grime of the east coast Yeah. With the modulation of the West coast. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b>That's a great way to look at it with the, with the triangle based oscillators. And I think they sound great. I, but they're very clean sounding. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1862.925" data-end_ts="1863.165" title="1862.925" id=c_"1862.925">__Yeah__</span>. And the reason is the saw based oscillators, you can shape a triangle out of it, but there always ends up being a little bit of a hook. You can't get a perfect triangle out of a saw wave. Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1875.925" data-end_ts="1876.125" title="1875.925" id=c_"1875.925">__<inaudible>__</span>, it's always gonna be a touchable hook. And so you're always gonna have some harmonics there that technically shouldn't be there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b>But what it does is it, it gives it its own sound <span style="color:red" data-ts="1888.985" data-end_ts="1889.205" title="1888.985" id=c_"1888.985">__and__</span> it, and although sort of textbook triangle wave, that's, it's not correct. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1895.945" data-end_ts="1896.165" title="1895.945" id=c_"1895.945">__And__</span> I haven't met a musician yet that uses that kind of stuff. You know, they <span style="color:red" data-ts="1900.965" data-end_ts="1901.165" title="1900.965" id=c_"1900.965">__go__</span> by sound and, and that's what we did too. So with the, that little hook there, you just get this bigger beefier sort of gnarlier dirtier sound out of it. And that's what we love. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, it's interesting because, I have an O'Toole oscilloscope in my system, and boy, some of the waveform, you wouldn't, you wouldn't want to take a kid and say, Hey, this is what a, a sine wave looks like, or Hey, this is, you know, I mean, as you say, oh no, they're not, they're not textbook correct. But boy, they sound good. Is there other places, is there other places in the system where you said, you know, the correct way is X but we're gonna choose to go direction Y because it's more musical? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b>Well, we, we make that decision when we're designing every module, every decision we make is how musical is it gonna be? How can we, what features can we add that are gonna make this more attractive for a musician? Or what are they gonna want to use 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b>As they're making music? I know what I'm personally interested in, and that's what sort of I've, I fight for when we're sitting down sort of flushing these ideas out. And everyone else, at the shop kind of does the same thing as far as other modules that aren't exactly textbook, you know, we could talk about probably every single <laugh> <laugh> every single module in, in the book. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1999.745" data-end_ts="1999.965" title="1999.745" id=c_"1999.745">__It__</span>, a lot of times it comes down to not making something necessarily wrong, but making sort of functionality decisions and taking them away from the musician. So sort of limiting their choices because we as designers and we as musicians understand that, you know, if you're gonna be patching from one module to another module, well the module you're coming out of is already taken care of a lot of that. So to have redundant feature sets between two different modules, is something that we try to avoid. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b>So a lot of the times it just comes down to, okay, what is the overall <span style="color:red" data-ts="2047.465" data-end_ts="2047.885" title="2047.465" id=c_"2047.465">__pallet__</span> that we're trying to present? And let's design a set of modules to provide that. And that's, again, that goes back to why we make synthesizers and don't focus as much on the individual modules. And the reason is we can make those overall decisions over the span of five or six modules. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b>And then incorporate them into a synthesizer where you look at it together and you go, oh, this makes total sense. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that's interesting you say that because I've actually, prior to getting a system, I had picked up, you know, onesie twosie Pittsburgh modules to kind of fill in holes in my system. And I was always like, yeah, does the work Right. But when I got the system all of a sudden, like the, to the way that everything worked together, seemed really clear, and especially, like I said, I have a foundation two system, the left to right layout, all of a sudden, it's almost as if it was designed to be laid out that way, because just where you need a function, well, there kind of is that module and that that ends up being really, really a pretty interesting design. And, and it sounds like you've thought about it that way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b>Yeah. Well, the foundation specifically the design was always sort of, the idea of the mini mug. Right. Because usability and understandability is so important to us, we thought, let's take the most ubiquitous synthesizer out there, sort of a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2137.255" data-end_ts="2137.605" title="2137.255" id=c_"2137.255">__sense__</span> that everyone's gonna have some rudimentary understanding of whether they've, you know, actually played one themselves or not. And so the MiniMogue really defines that. So it defined the sort of left to right signal flow and, you know, your oscillators, your modulation, your mixers, your filter. And so we just took that design philosophy and say, this is a great way to work. Let's use the same thing with the idea that somewhat unfamiliar with synthesizers in general would be able to look at a foundation and say, okay, I don't know this particular synthesizer inside and out, but I do understand, I can see the signal flow. 'cause I see the oscillators go into the modulation, into the mixers, into the filters, into the envelopes of ECAs and then your output so they can understand the signal flow. And if you can get that even before you start touching it up, you're halfway there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b>So again, it's, it's all geared towards a musician making music and not focusing on working the instrument as much as they are is focusing on what sound do I want out of the instrument. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. So one of the things you mentioned is that, is that most of the work that you guys do is analog, but you've dabbled in digital a little bit. And I would think especially with your coding background, that, you know, doing digital stuff would be something that would be interesting or at least a natural extension of what you're doing. What, where, where do you stand on the digital module thing and is there a likelihood we're gonna see more activity in that, in that realm from Pittsburgh? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b>Well, I'm, I'm pro synthesizer <laugh>, so I'm not, yeah, <laugh>. There's a lot of people that, and I think this number's actually going down quite a bit. That used to be, you know, analog only, you know, no digital, just analog. But I, I, I don't think that's the case anymore. I really believe that if it sounds good, it can find a home. And something digital does that you can't do an analog. So there's, you know, there's some things you need to have a digital module to do. And that's, and I think that's great. As far as what Pittsburgh has done, we have, obviously, we have our MIDI modules, we have our MIDI three module, which is, I, I think just a phenomenal, maybe the CD converter. It, it's got arpeggiator and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2291.805" data-end_ts="2292.005" title="2291.805" id=c_"2291.805">__it__</span> every frequency or every keyboard response you could ever want. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2295.265" data-end_ts="2295.485" title="2295.265" id=c_"2295.265">__And__</span> that was actually the first module that I had programmed. So that was me saying, you know what? I've been out of programming for a little while. Maybe I can get back and give it a shot and see what I can come up with. We needed an upgraded <span style="color:red" data-ts="2310.275" data-end_ts="2310.565" title="2310.275" id=c_"2310.275">__MIDI__</span> module. I saw, I figured I'd try it myself and see how it went. And if, and if I didn't do a good job, I would, we would outsource it like we had done with the previous MIDI modules. But the results, I, I had a great time coding it. I really enjoyed it. 'cause I, I, I was really burned out even my job. But since I'm off and what I realized, if you're programming music gear, it's a lot more exciting than 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> than databases, <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2336.995" data-end_ts="2337.285" title="2336.995" id=c_"2336.995">__Than__</span> databases, <laugh>. So I, you know, I enjoyed programming it enough that, and the response for the mini three has been phenomenal. So that, that made me feel good too. So I, I enjoyed it enough that I said, you know what, I'm gonna try to do a sequencer module. I think sequencer modules are something that really work well in digital because you can do a lot of features that aren't necessarily impossible in analog, but very large require, I'm sorry, very large surrogates and, you know, end up being very expensive. So, I, we just recently released a module called the Game System, which is based on a, like a PlayStation thumb joystick and a very low res eight by eight three color, LED matrix display. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b>The idea is that it has six different games, or really, they're just six different types of sequencers, right. That you can use to, you know, drive your, drive your sense. And that again, was, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2399.595" data-end_ts="2399.815" title="2399.595" id=c_"2399.595">__is__</span> a ton of fun to program. And I think we squeezed every ounce of power and memory we put out of the chips and came up with something that, although sort of on its surface looks like it might be <span style="color:red" data-ts="2415.455" data-end_ts="2415.655" title="2415.455" id=c_"2415.455">__an__</span> a little bit of a novelty because it's got the display and it's got a joystick, turns out to be an, an incredibly powerful sequencer that you can do some really cool music with. So that's what we, that just started shipping maybe a month or so ago. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Uhhuh <affirmative>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2432.855" data-end_ts="2432.935" title="2432.855" id=c_"2432.855">__So__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b>We're, we are working on some digital stuff, the sort of more complex DSP style stuff. We do have an engineer that we work with. We have, one digital oscillator out already. It was called the Symbiotic Waves. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. It was a dual digital oscillator with, sort of a frequency dependent effects processor to blend the two oscillators together. It was, it was very unique. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2462.835" data-end_ts="2463.055" title="2462.835" id=c_"2462.835">__It__</span>, it sort of, I like the idea of digital kind of celebrating what digital does best. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That makes sense. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b>Sort <span style="color:red" data-ts="2469.575" data-end_ts="2469.655" title="2469.575" id=c_"2469.575">__of__</span> lo-fi, alia kind of rough sounding oscillators. So the symbiotic waves did that and it did it really well. And we're working with, the same, the same guy again on a new digital oscillator, probably double Helix, which is a wave table based oscillator, with the same idea that it's a dual wave table oscillator. And then you have the different processors to blend the wave forms in unique ways. But again, it's very raw, very alia, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2503.065" data-end_ts="2503.285" title="2503.065" id=c_"2503.065">__and__</span> very down and dirty, sort of digital being digital. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. Well, and also something that would, have a, have a unique place within the, the, Pittsburgh gear because, all the analog stuff around it would be able to, do interesting stuff with those highly alias waves as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b>Oh, absolutely. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2529.205" data-end_ts="2529.485" title="2529.205" id=c_"2529.205">__Those__</span>, the digital authors, they sound fantastic going through an analog filter. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. And there again, that kind of highlights the, the filter that you've got, which is always a good thing. Well, that, that sounds interesting. And I'm anxious to, to try some of these things out. I have, I have to admit, I haven't tried the game system out yet. And I am glad that you talked about it because you're right on the surface, it looks a little, oh, it looks a little gamey. And, I'm not a game guy <laugh>, so it's hard, it was hard for me to imagine it being a musical system, but I could see, if you think of it not as games, but as unique or idiosyncratic sequencers, it probably makes a lot more sense. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b>Absolutely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So, one of the things I, I noticed recently is that you started shipping like a version two of most of the modules. And, the biggest giveaway is that the front panels have lines on 'em instead of not, but is there other, is there other stuff inside there that people should be, should be paying attention to? Or is it, or is it mostly a cosmetic update? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b>Well, they weren't actually <span style="color:red" data-ts="2600.325" data-end_ts="2600.605" title="2600.325" id=c_"2600.325">__call__</span>, I think the internet <span style="color:red" data-ts="2601.605" data-end_ts="2601.925" title="2601.605" id=c_"2601.605">__ended__</span> up calling <span style="color:red" data-ts="2602.465" data-end_ts="2602.685" title="2602.465" id=c_"2602.465">__in__</span> version twos. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, modular Grid does, which is the 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b><laugh> Yeah. Modular Grid has them on theirs version too. And that, that actually caused us some problems. 'cause people felt like they, they didn't, they weren't getting the, the latest modules. Really it's, it's purely cosmetic. We've been over the last year and a half sort of updating our line to a bit of a cleaner look, and we've just recently sort of finished going through everything. So they all have the new look, the modules and subs haven't changed at all. It's the same great sound. It's, it's really, we just wanted a uniform clean look across the line. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. I see. Okay. That makes sense. Now, we've kind of burned through the time as tends to be the case with this, but I wanna ask you one, particular question, and that is about, about the world of modular synthesis, ma synthesizer manufacturing in general. I mean, I think that there's a lot of people that would argue that we are currently in the golden age of modular synthesizers that back in the day when Moog and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2669.065" data-end_ts="2669.485" title="2669.065" id=c_"2669.065">__Buchla__</span> were making them, the quantities were low and the costs were incredibly high. But, now with manufacturers like particularly like you and defer making modules that are, and I don't want to sound dismissive, but they're affordable on a barista salary, it really opens the door for an awful lot of people to get involved in modular synthesis that would've never been able to get involved before. And so now all of a sudden you're seeing things like Sweetwater carrying Modular Systems, or Nova Music or some of these other retailers as well as the modules, modular specific places like Control Voltage. Do you see that being able to expand, do you think that, that we're, we can get to a point where a modular synthesizer is kind of a standardized instrument for, musicians? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b>Oh, absolutely. This is just the beginning for modular synthesis. It's sort of a, I I hate to say it's a rebirth because I, I don't, I don't consider us, I don't feel like we're doing the same thing that they were doing in the late sixties and seventies. What we're doing <span style="color:red" data-ts="2746.265" data-end_ts="2746.485" title="2746.265" id=c_"2746.265">__it__</span>, it's, we are making sustainable businesses out of this and because of the technology we have now, we can make them affordable. I kind of like to feel that, you know, very similar to like guitar pedals. You know, once you have one or two, you want 10 <laugh>, and if the prices that they cost <span style="color:red" data-ts="2765.805" data-end_ts="2766.045" title="2765.805" id=c_"2765.805">__that__</span> you can afford to do that. Right. And we can afford to put them out at reasonable prices. What I think because of laptops and the way that you can have fantastic synthesis in a plugin on your laptop, you really have to justify your hardware needs now in a different way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b>And modular gives you something that you can't get with a software plugin. You know, the idea that you have this physical, tangible interaction with something and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2802.565" data-end_ts="2802.765" title="2802.565" id=c_"2802.565">__that__</span> you can build it and you can use our filter and you can use the Studio Electronics oscillator, and you can use maybe, you know, the Studio Electronics 30 0 3 filter or the, along with the Pittsburgh VCA, you know, that's something that you can't do in software. So I think it's sort of, we are the next evolution in synthesis. They tried it in the seventies and it, the technology, the ideas were all there, but the technology was too expensive. Well, now we can do it with the prices where they need to be so that the next generation of musicians, you know, that the kids in high school and the kids in college can afford to buy systems, maybe not giant systems, but they can afford to use modular synthesis to do something that no one's heard before. Right. And that's, that's the big difference. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, and it's interesting because you, you mentioned that, you know, even like college students could buy something, but maybe not a big system, but one of the things that's really interesting to me is that in the modular world, you don't need to have an enormous system to, to get something that sounds unique and really kind of personal. You know, people find ways to patch sounds that match their personalities or match their emotional state or whatever. It's one of the magical things about modular systems that I, that I have to admit that I just love, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b>I have a, a small recording studio in my home. And my mod mod there is, is, you know, for someone that owns a modular synthesis company, is, is very modest. I have, I've, moved 1 0 4 case full of modules and that's what I use to make music with. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, that's great. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b>'cause I've, I've curated it down to this is what I need to do. The type of music that I enjoy to play. Right now, I use, I use other synthesizers as well. You know, I have a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2912.925" data-end_ts="2913.765" title="2912.925" id=c_"2912.925">__2 0 1 0 6__</span> that I have, some other stuff that I just cherish and I love to use on tracks. But, you know, modular is part of everything I do, but I have a, a very stripped down system because it gives me everything that I need. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's, that's a really great thing. I, I mean, it's funny you say that because I think everyone's imagination of what a modular synth owner's house must look like is that you don't even have wallpaper. You just have modules covering all of the walls. Right. <laugh>. And so it's kinda interesting that you found that actually restricting things makes you do what you love. So that's cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2950.945" data-end_ts="2951.165" title="2950.945" id=c_"2950.945">__But__</span> I, I've worked like that forever, you know, down to, you know, working with cassette tape recorders instead of laptops. Oh, sure. I thought it was getting in the way, but I, I, I like simple and easy. Yeah. I like the idea that if I can, I can move it and sit on my porch if I want to. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, that's always, that's always a fun perspective. Right. Well Richard, I wanna thank you so much for taking the time out of your surely busy schedule to, to talk with me and with my listeners. This is a fantastic discussion and I wish you the best. Thank you very much. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard: </b>Well thanks for having me. It's been great fun. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright, have a great day. Bye bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I wanna thank Richard for spending the time with me on that. It was a fantastic interview. I learned an awful lot about Pittsburgh. I'm sure you did too. I want to thank, Jim and Elizabeth over at opia for helping pull this one together. They really did some nice front end work to help me get, Richard's attention. But, all in all, I just am really happy to anytime I get a chance to talk to modular people. Anyway, I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did. Thanks a lot for listening. Make sure you tune in next week and if you got time in between, catch up on some old episodes. We're getting an awful wonderful backlog out there and I'd love for you to really, embrace some of the work that we've done. So thank you so much. Catch you next week. Bye. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3035.845" data-end_ts="3035.965" title="3035.845" id=c_"3035.845">__Bye__</span>.
