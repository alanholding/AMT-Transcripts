<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today I have the pleasure of getting a chance to talk to somebody that really is doing some really neat work. His name's Matt Lang, and he was, another one of the people introduced to me by Bonna Hoffer, and is kind of a group of people who know each other out in LA that are heavily into modulars. But Matt has got something going that I think is really kind of interesting, which is that he's doing a lot of sort of like main mainline production work. And, I was, I was actually really into the idea that he was interviewed on the Satos Place video blog or whatever they call it, which was, I mean, that's like where the superstar producers and engineers go to get their word out. So that tells you a little bit of something about where Matt's coming from. So with that, we'll just say hi. Hey, Matt. How's it going? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt Lange: </b>Good. Good to be here, Darwin. Thanks for having me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Thank you so much for joining. I appreciate it. I know you're a busy guy, so I, I appreciate you taking the time. Let's start off by talking a little bit about what your work is. So I've gotten to be a bit of a fan of yours. I really liked the patchwork release that you did. I think that was last year sometime, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>April 16. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Yeah. And then the year before you put out ephemeral, which is, I think the first time I had heard of you was, was that was true. And so, I've kind of been a fan of, fan of those works, and I liked them because it was, there was some pretty aggressive and interesting sound design, but it was still mixed to exist in sort of a, a fairly straightforward dance type genre thing. I, I thought it was, it was nice because it pushed boundaries without being alien, and it was a really, some really good releases. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>Awesome. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I also have to admit that like half of the title of these titles on these two releases are like some pun on modular module names. And so I have to admit that that that probably suckered me in more than anything <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="133.715" data-end_ts="134.205" title="133.715" id=c_"133.715">__Certain__</span>. That was certainly, kind of the, the ethos behind the first five tracks of Patchwork, certainly. Right. Well, and it was almost every track was in a way, a study of a module. Got 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It. Yeah. Hertz don't, it was, probably my favorite twist. I, I, I thought that was pretty funny. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>And I mean, and that module, of course is a twist on its own. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It is indeed. Indeed. Yeah. So I talked about these long <span style="color:red" data-ts="159.525" data-end_ts="159.765" title="159.525" id=c_"159.525">__forms__</span> that you've done. What are some of the stuff that you've, you've got in the hopper for recent work 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>Coming up? I think it's April 7th, there's gonna be another, mousetrap ep, and that is called Escapist. And that has three tracks on it that are mostly modular based. One of them is, it's called Count It because the time signature is 21 8. And it was kind of, and it started off at the melody came from just messing around on the Renee, right. It was, Renee through, sch Shaman and, or Renee triggering a shaman VC O2 through, sch Shaman, MMF one s. And I just got the Shaman thing, so I was really excited by it. So that was kind of an experiment <span style="color:red" data-ts="200.185" data-end_ts="200.405" title="200.185" id=c_"200.185">__in__</span> trying to make a very odd time signature work in a dance floor context. Right. And so far it has, people have played it out surprisingly. Then there's another called Book Biter, which again, it's basically a love affair that, that one, it's, just really all a resonant filter through, again, a Renee melody. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And then, finally the last one is the title track escapist. And that one is actually more sound designy and a lot of like, distorted low brass Han Zimmer kind of rumbles of bass. And so that's, that's escapist. And then pretty much a direct week right after that. Then I have an EP out, on my own label <span style="color:red" data-ts="243.145" data-end_ts="243.365" title="243.145" id=c_"243.145">__Ice__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="243.365" data-end_ts="243.645" title="243.365" id=c_"243.365">__rhythm__</span>. That one is much more rock and industrial based, which I kind of hinted at certainly on ephemera, like tracks like inside my head. Right. And then, on patchwork empty walls and Consider this. And that's three tracks of that more cinematic, progressive rock world that, I mean, that's really where I'm most comfortable. That's my background really. So that's, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's interesting because, you know, I was, and maybe it's just my own, my own biases, right. But one of the things I tend to notice is that a lot of people that are electronic music heads, they approach melody and especially approach vocals, with great trepidation, right. <laugh>. Yeah. It's like putting a vocal track down is like the last thing a typical electronic guy wants to do. Right? Right. But empty walls would consider this, you know, certainly are that and, and certainly more melodic and different than the other work on that release. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>Yeah. I mean, on, on Patchwork, that is a direct result of splitting up with the woman I thought I was gonna marry. <span style="color:red" data-ts="312.225" data-end_ts="312.445" title="312.225" id=c_"312.225">__Oh__</span>. And, yeah, that just, you know, so the five, the techno tracks, those were all done, and then that happened and it was just, you know, my entire world got turned upside down. Sure. So that was where, those two tracks came from. Even though consider this was ultimately written about somebody else who has always kind of been there for me. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah. So actually one of the, one of the tracks on the new EP or the new EP on my own label, it's called Punish Me, which is awfully dramatic, but it started, I actually wrote it initially when my ex and I were starting to like, go through a lot of issues and stuff like that. And I, like, I, I got her <span style="color:red" data-ts="350.605" data-end_ts="350.805" title="350.605" id=c_"350.605">__outta__</span> the computer. Like, you have to hear this, you know, like this, I'm expressing myself. <span style="color:red" data-ts="353.825" data-end_ts="354.045" title="353.825" id=c_"353.825">__And__</span> you, I was really excited about that <laugh>, and she was so mad. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>No, that's hilarious. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>Oh my God. Yeah. That's always like the nature of all my personal tracks, it's always about women always. <span style="color:red" data-ts="366.645" data-end_ts="366.885" title="366.645" id=c_"366.645">__That__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Isn't really, that's funny. Well, it's, it's interesting though, again, to think of, I don't know, maybe it's, maybe it's just something, a trope that I've, I've come to believe in, which is that there isn't a lot of super emotion put into a lot of electronic, especially tracks that, that are, tend to be sound designy and stuff like that. They tend to be cinematic or they tend to be really sonically deep. But I'm not sure that there's often, I just broke up with this woman I love kind of thing going down. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>Well, you know, it's really easy to hide behind machines. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, that's true. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>You know, like there's a vulnerability that you have when it's just a voice and a guitar. Right. That, or a piano that, I mean, <span style="color:red" data-ts="416.765" data-end_ts="416.925" title="416.765" id=c_"416.765">__it__</span>, it's haunting it, it absolutely breaks you down if it hits you in the right way. And you can't really do that with, for instance, a modular in my own. I mean, some people can find that and that's great for them, but for me it doesn't hit that chord. Right. I mean, I, my background is, I mean, I sung in a boy choir for God, seven years, and then I played in a band forever. And I mean, my background has always been pretty traditional actually. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So the modular to me is just really, it's just another expensive guitar <laugh>. And it, I mean, it's just like, it has its own flavor. It does its own thing. Is it the end of the world for me? No. It's just another color on my palette. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>One of the things that kind of caught my ear when I saw you on the Sato thing is that now I think they were probably not used to talking to people that had modular, you know, modular chops. Yeah. So for them, they were really intrigued because it was sort of, it was unique and it was, novel. Right. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>It is, and Modular, of course, is going through this renaissance right now too. Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="480.605" data-end_ts="480.805" title="480.605" id=c_"480.605">__Where__</span>, you know, it's really cool and it's exciting and, you know, people are excited about it 'cause they've never seen it before. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> at least not on, you know, a more mainstream stand. Right. So it's a great talking point, and I'm sure, you know, part of the fact that I'm involved with it is part of the thing that made me attractive to them, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Probably. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>You know, I'm not gonna discount it. That's awesome. The 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Other interesting thing is, in the recording world, they sort of had their own kind of similar res renaissance with the 500 series recording stuff. Recording <span style="color:red" data-ts="514.045" data-end_ts="514.125" title="514.045" id=c_"514.045">__stuff__</span>. Oh, totally. Right. So that people got into this idea of, well, I can build a studio up, you know, one little bit and piece at a time. Absolutely. So then coming to them and say, well, you could do the same thing with your synthesizer actually can make sense to 'em. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>Yeah. It's great. I mean, and I'm, I'm glad this format exists right now, just because you are able to be really creative and you can build essentially the Frankenstein you always wanted. Right. But at the same time, I mean, I find I will turn to it for, I'll turn to it when I'm stuck and I need to come up with an idea that I wouldn't come in a traditional way. Right. But I'll never come up with something that guts me from the inside out. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>And that's, you know, that's where I like, it's funny, I mean, based on the music, I, you know, I create, what I end up listening to is never what people expect. And I'm just listening to Singer songwriters half the time. <laugh> Yeah. Like singer songwriters and a Perfect Circle <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>And, and that's, you know, that's where I live. That's ultimately, I think the modular for me is just another tool to ultimately be able to create music. I hope that can affect people the same way that like Alpha Arnold's, God, what's the name of that record? For now I'm Winter. Right. Like, I just, I wanna write something that devastates me the same way that record devastated me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. It's, it's funny because I would say that a lot of people listen to electronic music for fun, but when you really dive into it, a lot of, I mean, I know for myself, I love electronic music and I, and I love experimentalism, I love dance genres, I love all this stuff. But a lot of times what I really want to hear is like some Ry Coer album from the eighties <laugh>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="620.085" data-end_ts="620.245" title="620.085" id=c_"620.085">__Right__</span>. <laugh> or totally Joni Mitchell's live album or something like that. Right. Something that does a different take where emotion is more at the center maybe than technical skill, or technical or, or the combination of modules that were purchased to make it happen. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>And ultimately, it doesn't matter what modules you used, I mean, you could have done it on a fucking Casio. Right. Who cares. Right. You know, like only the purists who are really into that scene are gonna care about what gear you used. Yeah. But I mean, gear for me is just another tool. Sure. I like gear because it personally makes making music more enjoyable for me. Right. But at the end of the day, it's all about how it makes someone feel. And whatever you need to do to translate that, the best way is how you should do it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Awesome. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>You know? Yeah. That's kind of where I'm at with all that stuff. I just wanna make people hurt <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>I'm kidding. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>As long as someone's crying by the end of the album, we're good. Right. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>No, that's a Well, hey, that's the thing though. I would much rather have anger or tears, right. Than apathy. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="685.385" data-end_ts="685.605" title="685.385" id=c_"685.385">__Go__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="685.605" data-end_ts="685.685" title="685.605" id=c_"685.605">__Ahead__</span>. Like if it's apathy, it's a failure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>But, you know, if someone really feels something, whether you know it's joy or, or hatred 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>Yeah. Or gloom or hatred, whatever. Right. Then it's successful to me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. So you just laid a couple of, a couple of breadcrumbs that I want to follow up on a little bit. <laugh>, boys choir for some number of years playing in bands. One of the things I like doing in my podcast is I really like hearing people's stories of how they got from whatever their beginnings were to where they are now. And it sounds like you got a bit of a story there. My man, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b><laugh>, it's my entire life. <laugh>. Yeah. So, when I was a kid, my parents had me at a piano when I was four or five or something like that. In true kid form, I only wanted to go outside and play soccer or baseball. Right. So I didn't practice, but that evolved into eventually playing flute for a few years because of, you know, just regular school orchestra kind of things. And then when I was six, six or seven, I got introduced to the Choir Master at my school, and they had me audition. And that turned into singing This Boy Choir for six or seven years. And it eventually got to the point where I was head corer and my name is like, painted on the wall of this church, which is pretty funny. And I haven't walked through the doors of that church in God, 15 years that had me just performing, I mean, basically every Sunday. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And aside from doing church masses, which were, it's kind of an interesting thing 'cause my family is not religious at all, and it was just, because of the music, you were there, but then almost by proxy you become part of this very, it was Episcopalian, it wasn't Catholic, so it wasn't, you know, too gloomy. But it was just interesting being a part of this very religious community when, <laugh> it was really just about music to me. Right. And really to my family too, that all aside, that had me performing on a weekly basis. And then I ultimately ended up, through it. I would do, I would sing for weddings sometimes. Like I sung for like a Saudi princess getting married once, which was really weird. Wow. And, I sung funerals, which was really strange also. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> that eventually led to also doing a couple like off Broadway things, which was also a new experience. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>And this was all before I was even, you know, 13 years old. Wow. So did all that. And then, basically when my voice changed, I picked up a guitar. And so I was 13 and I was, I grew up listening to Metal, so it was picked a guitar and I'm trying to play Metallica. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Simple as that. Right. And that evolved into, playing, and I guess it was kind of like a hardcore, we, it was a band in high school and I don't know what we used to kid ourselves and say we were, teenage innovators of post, post, post hardcore <laugh> <laugh>. But really what it was, we were just taking, like the post rock influences of bands, like Explosions in the Sky and, do <span style="color:red" data-ts="873.485" data-end_ts="873.685" title="873.485" id=c_"873.485">__mix__</span>, I think. And then marrying it with the kind of, late nineties, early two thousands screamo a bands like Stacia and Hot Cross, which was really very aggressive and chaotic and lots of screams, so 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>So it was that plus post rock. And, did that until basically, I wanna say I was a senior in high school and I was getting way into the more technical side of music. And most of the stuff I was listening to at this point were progressive metal bands like Dream Theater and opec, and things that required a lot of technicality. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and the other guys in the band, they were kind of wanting to follow the road of the Strokes. There was a serious dissonance going on there. Right. And by, by the nature of that, I started learning how to just record my own demos. So I had my guitar and I had this old, Barringer Vamp, which was like a cheap copy of a Line six pod. Right. And I would, just record all these guitar riffs and whatever, and then I got a copy of like Fruity Loops one, and I would make just the silliest little beats, but it was really at the time just a backing beat for my guitar. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>Playing around that same time, I got really into Nine Inch Nails and I got really into a <span style="color:red" data-ts="952.965" data-end_ts="953.165" title="952.965" id=c_"952.965">__Effects__</span> twin Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So then I started getting into more of the electronic Beat programming, but I was still doing it, just making these basic beats basically in, in Fruity Loops. And then I'd port everything over to Acid Pro and I would kind of record all the guitars in there. And <laugh> just, it was always throwing like these two things back and forth, like making a beat here, throwing into acid, cutting it up there. Sure. It's all audio. That path basically led me to go to Berkeley College of Music. From there, I really got into the sound design thing. I got way into IDMI was into it before, but at Berkeley, I think my first semester there I was introduced to Telephone Tel Aviv. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>And that, I mean, that band changed my life. Right. It changed how I wrote music entirely. And then later, I got into Richard Divine's music a lot and it was just, and that kind of whole world when they were doing like schematic records and it was this, the Break Corish, but also very sound design heavy electronic music, which was so prevalent, I wanna say, you know, early mid two thousands. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And that was so heavily influential for me. Right. So all the music I was kind of doing back then was rooted in that. And I wasn't doing much with any traditional instruments. I wasn't playing guitars. I just wanted to make crazy DSB based, you know, glitch music and using all like, the kind of contemporary sound design tools at the time to do that. Like <span style="color:red" data-ts="1044.355" data-end_ts="1044.475" title="1044.355" id=c_"1044.355">__C__</span> Sound and s Synth and Sound Hack, what have you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>Right. And that ultimately ended up, I did my senior thesis as a 15 minute long piece, and it was composed <span style="color:red" data-ts="1055.475" data-end_ts="1055.675" title="1055.475" id=c_"1055.475">__in__</span> Surround Sound that directly led to me getting hired by bt. So I don't, I don't think I actually, I never walked for graduation. I did graduate 'cause I did all the credits, but I finished up a semester early, and by the time graduation happened, I was already, I was down in DC and I was working for BT Sure. With him. I was there for just about a year. And I worked on his album, these Hopeful Machines. And we also did a Pixar short film. It was a cars film then, like this orchestral score for the Sega video game called Alpha Protocol. That was the first time I was just thrown into, you know, <laugh>, it's Sink or Swim, a hundred percent <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>Right. And I was the only person working for him, and it was just in the woods. It was a lot of responsibility thrown on me. And he's a, he has a very big and complicated personality. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So it was a really hard experience. Sure. It <span style="color:red" data-ts="1115.325" data-end_ts="1115.485" title="1115.325" id=c_"1115.325">__was__</span>, I mean, I ended up with anxiety attacks for three years after I quit. Wow. But yeah, no, it <span style="color:red" data-ts="1120.365" data-end_ts="1120.445" title="1120.365" id=c_"1120.365">__was__</span> like, it really destroyed me, but I don't regret a moment of it. I learned so much about the industry, what it's like to be in a professional manner, how to treat people, more importantly, how to not treat people. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And also how to interface with studio executives <span style="color:red" data-ts="1138.345" data-end_ts="1138.565" title="1138.345" id=c_"1138.345">__via__</span> its Pixar or its major label record heads. I mean, it was all this stuff when I was 21 years old trying to have to figure out on my own. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>And I was really isolated because where I lived and where he lived was very remote. So the only thing that kind of kept me stable at the time is I had a girlfriend who lived up in Boston and she would, you know, fly down to see me once a month. And that was my one safety net that kind of kept me grounded. So I quit after a year and moved home six months later, moved back to Boston, stayed there for a year and a half, try to figure out what the hell I'm doing with my life. You know, how am I gonna, like, I have to make music. Like that's the only viable option. I was staying in this tiny little apartment, I think getting by on like $600 a month. After a year and a half of doing it, it was just like, I can't make this work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>I was doing little bits of ghost production here and there for other producers and trying to do my own thing. And it was during this time, some of the dance tracks I had done, they started getting released by, an <span style="color:red" data-ts="1200.295" data-end_ts="1200.585" title="1200.295" id=c_"1200.295">__deep__</span>, which is above and beyond's record label. Right. It was very like slow momentum though. You know, I, I wasn't making anything. It was just all hoping that, you know, something would happen <laugh>. So I gave up on that and I moved back home to New York for two years. It was kind of great because my parents, I grew up in New York City and when I moved to Boston to go to school, they sold the apartment and they moved to upstate New York. Now they basically had all this farmland and, they're photographers, so they had actually turned the, the barn into a photo studio. Oh, okay. And the top part of the barn was empty. So I just set up all my stuff and that became my studio for two years in the top part of the barn. Mixing in a barn is the worst thing ever. <laugh>. <laugh>, it's awful. You know, you can't hear a thing. And then there <span style="color:red" data-ts="1250.485" data-end_ts="1250.525" title="1250.485" id=c_"1250.485">__are__</span> wasps that'll fly around in the summer, and I hate bees. So it's just like, you know, I'm sitting there and something fucking lands on my head and I freak out and Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh man. Well, and it's upstate new New York, so winters are no kiss for Christmas either. Oh 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>Man. Like <laugh>, it was this kind of, we were all in it together though, so Right, right. You just bundle up in long underwear and, you know, a park and go and, and you're sitting <laugh> at your studio chair all bundled up with gloves and 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, everything 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b><laugh>. But, you know, you do it somehow. In that time, I was doing, a lot of work with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1285.565" data-end_ts="1286.085" title="1285.565" id=c_"1285.565">__Glenn Morrison__</span> and he, he kinda came up, with Dead <span style="color:red" data-ts="1288.725" data-end_ts="1288.965" title="1288.725" id=c_"1288.725">__Mouse__</span> in like late two thousands. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, so I was flying out to Toronto about once a month at that point to kind of work with him, help him set up a studio, and he wanted to get more into pop songwriting. And that was something I really enjoyed. I did a God, a bunch of tracks that were gonna be on his album. And one of 'em was this track called Goodbye. Three years later, goodbye Ends Up Going Double Platinum. Which was an interesting experience because it's, ironically, it's the song. If I never had to hear that song ever again, I would be thrilled <laugh>, but, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But instead it's the one that's probably gonna be inscribed on <span style="color:red" data-ts="1324.805" data-end_ts="1325.005" title="1324.805" id=c_"1324.805">__your__</span> <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>I know. You 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>I know. Isn't that always how it works? <laugh>? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's, I'm sure you're right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>But at that same time, so I came out to a year and I flew out to LA for the first time to play show out here. I just fell in love with the city. It just, it resonated with me. It was like the moment I got off the plane, just I breathed <span style="color:red" data-ts="1344.615" data-end_ts="1344.965" title="1344.615" id=c_"1344.615">__deasy__</span>. Simple as that. And so I played the show and then, a friend of mine from college who, was a really close friend, she took me around LA and like drove me around the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1353.965" data-end_ts="1354.125" title="1353.965" id=c_"1353.965">__Holland__</span> Drive and a couple of her own, like favorite childhood spots. And it was just such a pivotal moment in my life where on the third day I pretty much just sat up at the top of a hill and realized I, I had to move out here. And there were some things at home I had to, you know, rid myself of to be able to do that. Right. So I did, and I got a publishing deal and I took the money and I just moved. That turned into being out here and kind of doing everything since 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, going back all the way to you being in the boy choir in this Episcopalian church. One of the things that I think is kind of interesting, and it's maybe changing a little bit, but I think that actually this idea of the church being sort of a launching point for at least some people's musical experiences is kind of important. Because if you think about it, there are damn few scenarios where a 8-year-old can get experienced doing weekly gigging, you know? Absolutely. It's a pretty amazing, it's a pretty amazing training ground if you think, if you extract it yourself from the church part of it, just in terms of the requirement it takes to show up every week and to do new material when, when it's requested or, you know, special occasions like a wedding or something comes up and you have to, you have to do that. That's a, that's a pretty amazing thing and something that I think can really set the stage for you later in life of understanding what that kind of work is gonna feel like. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>Oh yeah. I mean, it's, there are very few scenarios in which that would ever 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Happen that could happen right now. Of the other people that were in the choir with you did, have you kept up with any of 'em, or, I mean, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>No, I mean, to be honest, the whole thing actually has a pretty sour spin on it. Uhhuh <affirmative>, because ultimately my choir master, he was gay and the church decided that they were gonna say he saw him touching us, which never happened. But, consequently they got the board of the church behind it all and they fired him. And that was, to be honest, that was the end of religion for me right then and there. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Really, boy, that'll 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>Do. Right. Yeah. A year later I'm reading Karl Marx, you know? Right. So, I think one of 'em, he, he went on to actually be in the Lion King on Broadway at one point. And he was amazingly talented. But the others, I honestly don't know because the thing is too, I was 12. Right. 13 when it all ended. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You're not really thinking about lifetime connections at that point. Are you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b><laugh> No. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>Not at all. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, the only reason I asked is because to a certain extent, again, the age is, the age is, doesn't make it quite as viable. But despite, I mean, in addition to what you talk about <span style="color:red" data-ts="1540.145" data-end_ts="1540.365" title="1540.145" id=c_"1540.145">__as__</span> like this closing trauma of the, of this, this scenario with the, with the choir leader, I mean, there's also just the trauma of doing it all the time. And I would think that there would end up being sort of like, you know, almost like foxhole best friend scenarios, you know, just because Yeah. You know, you just, you plowed through it for seven years together. There's probably had to be some comradery, but at the same time Yeah, you're 12 and so when you go, it's not like, you know, your parents aren't gonna probably make a big effort to try and keep you connected. And when you're 12 years old, that kind of has to be the, the locust of some of that effort. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>Yeah. And I think also I didn't realize, you know, the weight of what had happened until I was older, you know? Oh, I see. Right. But I think consequently I was, I kind of wanted to stay far away from it for a while too. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1594.425" data-end_ts="1594.645" title="1594.425" id=c_"1594.425">__Ah__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>Because I was just kind of weirded out by the whole thing. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That's a heck of a shit storm to, to watch come down too. Right. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>And the thing is, when you're 12, you don't know what's happening. Right. Like, you don't, you don't actually understand it. And it wasn't until I think I was probably 20 that it all clicked and then it was kind of fucked up because then I got in my head like, wait, did something ever happen? And I'm like backtracking through my head like, do I ever repressed memories of, you know, some atrocity? Yeah. And like, and you know, it was the kind of thing, like I was really curious about that and for a while and you know, you, I think ultimately it's easy to create delusions in your head. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So I think it took me a while just to kind of make peace with the whole thing because of the fear of what if, even if, you know, it was completely irrational. Sure. So when you have all these adults also telling you that something happened, even if it didn't, because, you know, they had their own motives to do it, which was just, oh God, religious intolerance, what have you, it kind of fucks you up a little bit. Yeah. Yeah. It wasn't <span style="color:red" data-ts="1662.085" data-end_ts="1662.205" title="1662.085" id=c_"1662.085">__until__</span> I was older, I kind of like realized what the real story was and everything like that. Yeah. I mean, it's really dark. It's really, it's really ugly and just, you know, what they did to him and you know, his life is just atrocious 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Boy. So now it's, <laugh> to go from that. Let's talk about Fruity Loops. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>Oh man. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Actually, no, but I'm curious about something, which is, what was your primary instrument there and what department were you in at Berkeley? Were you in like synth design department or the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1693.935" data-end_ts="1694.285" title="1693.935" id=c_"1693.935">__score__</span>? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>Yeah, so I am Guitar was my principal instrument. Oh, okay. And 'cause at the time you had to have a principal instrument. Right. I don't know if you do now, but guitar was it. And, my major ultimately was music synthesis. Okay. Which no longer exists now. It's called like Electronic Music Production and Design or something. E<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data">PD</a> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>When I went it was Synthesis. And it's funny, I actually, I didn't get accepted into it right away 'cause I came in like doing like this kind of IDME kind of stuff. And I do the interview and in my head I'm thinking, oh, I'm a s shoe <span style="color:red" data-ts="1726.605" data-end_ts="1726.805" title="1726.605" id=c_"1726.605">__in__</span>, you know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>And, and the guy interview with, you know, interviews me and you had to go through this whole application process and, and he starts drilling me like, well, you know what, if you're in this scenario, you have to make music like this. And me being like a cocky <span style="color:red" data-ts="1742.765" data-end_ts="1742.925" title="1742.765" id=c_"1742.765">__night__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1742.925" data-end_ts="1743.085" title="1742.925" id=c_"1742.925">__year__</span> old kid is like, I don't want to do it. I don't, you know, fuck that. You know, and, and I would go through, you know, all these reasons why I was like, no, I'm just gonna make what I want because that's what I love, you know? And, and he straight up told me to drop outta music school and become a lawyer. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh my God. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>Yeah. So that didn't happen. Clearly <laugh>, but doing synth, you know, they really had you really like learning how to do the building blocks of synthesizers. And we learned on a Nord modular. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. That was, really the beginning of all of it. I got really into reactor at one point. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and Reactor was really, because I took a class in Max MSP and I hated Max <laugh>. Like I just found it the most uninspiring thing ever. But it opened up the doors to reactor for me. And suddenly when I opened up Reactor, I knew exactly what to do 'cause I understood signal flow and how to patch things and Sure. What have you. Which ultimately, you know, the modular became kind of secondhand or second nature. So that was it. You know, it was really a lot of sound design music to picture, which was really helpful for me later. And, just, I was in a community at the time where my class we were, or my little group of my class, we were all way into IDM. Right. And it was so helpful because, you know, we were all just almost competing with each other on a subconscious level of, you know, who can make the craziest sound design, who could, you know, sound like Richard Divine the closest. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>And it was a little bit different. 'cause you know, now I go and it's all who can make trap. I feel very fortunate I was there in which the years I was, because it, it was, it was a really healthy competitive state. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So I loved it. So it sounds like, sounds like though, the Berkeley timeframe you was pretty, pretty confident and pretty balls to the wall and, and then to come out of Berkeley and, and roll basically directly into a gig with bt, that probably further helped you feel like you were on top of it. So then when you, when when you removed yourself from that, and next thing you know, you're back, you know, you're kind living on a shoestring in Boston and then back in, in New York with your parents, did it ever feel kind of defeat? Like you, you'd gotten defeated or, or somehow you'd gotten beaten outta something? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>Yeah. I mean, to be honest, the whole BT experiment or experience was the ultimate ego killer. Yeah. I feel like I aged 10 years doing that thing. Right. And 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And you said that was one year long? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>Yeah, that was a year long. Like, I, I went in there thinking I was, you know, king of the world and I came out of there feeling pretty worthless. Right. And, but at the same time, grateful for the experiences I had had. It was a very confusing time for me. That was the turning point right then and there. And I feel like also, I mean like every musician ultimately has to get fucked over a bunch of times before they really get it. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>And then confidence comes. I think it's actually more, it's a truer confidence as opposed to just simple arrogance. And it's very easy to confuse the two of those. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. I think something else happens too, which is getting, getting screwed early enough kind of puts you in a position to be careful and, you know, when you're actually coming into your own. And that's probably useful as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and it needs to, like, it needs to happen a few times in a row. Right. Because, you know, otherwise you just think it's an isolated situation. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>It's tough, but I mean, it builds character. You know, it's the kind of thing where you really need to go through a lot of hard times, especially as, you know, a self-employed musician. I mean, it's hard, it's really hard. I'm just fortunate that my parents were artists, so I kind of grew up with the whole polarity swings of, you know, now things are good. Now things are hard. Now things are good. Now things are hard because that's normal for me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That wasn't a surprise. You weren't surprised by that, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>No. And it's like, what am I gonna do? It's like, well, it's gonna turn around at some point, keep going. You <span style="color:red" data-ts="1993.925" data-end_ts="1993.965" title="1993.925" id=c_"1993.925">__know__</span>? Or you could stop moving and then you're really fucked. But Right. <laugh>, you gotta keep going no matter what. And money will come, money will go, career will go up, career will go down. It never ends. Boy, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>There's a whole bunch of stuff there. I would like to, but we're burning through time here and I want to talk about this move to LA and basically what's happened for you since, since you've been out there. So, moving to LA it sounds like you actually really found your, you sort of like found the right frequency for you that that was the place, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Was it the people or was it the, the kind of gigs you were finding, or was it just, just the humidity and the temperature? What is it that really, that really rung for you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>I wish I could say it to the people. As a New Yorker, a native New Yorker, I feel pretty allergic to most of the population of La <laugh>. But no, I just felt like when I got off the plane, I just felt like I was at home given it. I'd also lived through 25 years of Sub-Zero winters Uhhuh. And when I got out here and suddenly it's 70 degrees in January and it's like one of the most beautiful places I've ever been. I mean, it just, it felt so right. And I felt at ease. I mean, I think on the East Coast everyone carries a significant amount of angst around with them. Right. And everything here was more relaxed. People were happier. I was happier. And that was a new experience for me. And then on top of it, the work, I mean, it wasn't like, it was crazy work, but just knowing a lot of musicians here was really helpful. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And someone I had met while I was working for BT was Blake Lewis, who he was, he got second place in American Idol and we'd remained friends over the years until I moved up here. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and I moved out and he just coincidentally happened to live a mile down the road from me. Oh, wow. So, so we just started working together immediately and that turned into, producing his third album. And so that was the first year and a half I was out here, was pretty much doing his album. And then at the same time I was doing Tanya Zara's album. And she is, an amazing songwriter. She's, she's from Ottawa. And, also like one of my closest friends, just like most important person, people in my life. And, so I was doing her album at the same time too. And consequently, I think really the first two years I didn't really actually do much of my own work. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> because so much of it was focused on producing two different <span style="color:red" data-ts="2146.195" data-end_ts="2146.685" title="2146.195" id=c_"2146.195">__artists__</span> albums. Busy. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>Both of those were, they were gambles, you know, it wasn't like we had major label budgets or anything like that. It was just purely because the three of us, we all believed in the work we were creating. Right. Ultimately, none of 'em turned into financial successes or anything like that, but the experience of it was just, you know, there's nothing like it. I mean, producing albums is, it's a marathon, especially when, you know, you're doing it yourself as in like the modern day sense of the producer where you have an artist and if it's just a singer, you know, they might come in with ideas, but you're doing everything and it's a ton of work, but it, when you love what you're doing, it's never really work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>When you were coming into the industry and you thought of the idea of a music producer, is it significant from what you found being a music producer actually is? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>Yes and no. I mean, obviously the role of producer has seriously evolved in the past, really 15 years. But I think that's the nature of a lot of us who now call ourselves professional record producers. The way we started, it wasn't like we were ars at a label and had good ideas and then, you know, got to be promoted into being a producer. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, we, by the nature of technology, we were able to create on our own and make records and not have to rent a studio. I mean, in my case, if you could play an instrument and you could figure out how to record and then figure out how to make basic beats, that's, that's the starting point. And then, you know, 15 years later you're doing people's records. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> now, I mean, how many producers are out there that, because they, they had a laptop and they were able to get a rated version of Fruity Loops or whatever. Those guys are some of the biggest producers in the world right now, from both the pop world down to the electronic underground world. A lot of 'em started directly from that. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So that's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>True. I mean, it's technology just, it's, it's allowed this to happen. I never thought I'd be a record producer in the sense of like, ironically mutt <span style="color:red" data-ts="2275.285" data-end_ts="2275.405" title="2275.285" id=c_"2275.285">__laying__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Yeah, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>You know, that's never been, in the cards. But <laugh>, you know, if I married a singer, it wouldn't surprise me either. <laugh>. So <laugh> looking at my track record, it's most likely, but <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>No, it's funny. I mean, yeah, I get, when I did the Pensato thing, there were all these comments on the YouTube video <span style="color:red" data-ts="2299.325" data-end_ts="2299.525" title="2299.325" id=c_"2299.325">__of__</span> like, we thought it was gonna be Mutt Lang, but we were so disappointed. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh man. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>That's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2306.765" data-end_ts="2306.925" title="2306.765" id=c_"2306.765">__harsh__</span>. Yeah. It's too funny. So I never saw this. I mean, I always knew I was gonna do music. I don't even really think of myself as a producer so much these days. Like I do produce, but I mean, I just frame myself at this point as an artist. Uhhuh, I don't really do anyone else's music these days. I'm I, I just pigeonholed myself to just do my own thing. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's cool. And 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>Yeah, it's really liberating. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You know, it's, it's interesting. I think this idea though, of coming from a family of artists actually gives you the freedom to do that, where a lot of other people wouldn't. I, I know that's true way too many stories of people who ended up becoming engineers or sound designers or whatever. They really wanted to be artists. But 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>All the jobs were coming up somewhere else and they just ended up feeling like, I'll never make it, I'll never be able to make it as an artist, so I'm gonna focus on these things where jobs are showing up. Right, right. And so you could almost see in their head, there was a point in time that where it clicked over and they were like, well, I'm not gonna pursue that artist bullshit anymore. I'm just gonna go ahead and be a mixer for, for the TV industry or something. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>You know, that exists. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I know, but it seems like you, even though you're doing these, doing other work as it as it comes up, that switch hasn't flipped in your head in any way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>No. Well, now also, I don't know, like the only thing I'm doing for other people right now is, like working on the new 30 Seconds <span style="color:red" data-ts="2396.505" data-end_ts="2396.725" title="2396.505" id=c_"2396.505">__to__</span> Mars album. And when I do that, it's, I come in basically as my own artist. And it's not like I'm at, you know, Jared let's house every day or anything like that. It's, you know, when I get a phone call, Hey, do you want <span style="color:red" data-ts="2410.205" data-end_ts="2410.285" title="2410.205" id=c_"2410.205">__to__</span> come like, let's go to Joshua Tree for three days and write music. Nice. Okay, let's go. Right. But now, when I get invited to do things like that, it's a very different role than, you know, come work for me. Sure. Which, which is great because it allows me also to just do whatever I want to do. And by that same token, <laugh>, you know, when I've been in situations where they're like, well, we wanted you to do different kind of music, and it's like, Hey man, you hired me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>You knew what you were gonna get. There's a lot of freedom in that, and I'm much more comfortable doing that too. So it's just, it just works out better for me personally. I'm bad at having a boss <laugh>. I am, it's like, you know, kind of, maybe it's like I grew up as a skater or a skateboarder, so, you know, maybe it's the the fuck you DIY attitude, punk rock thing. Sure. But I, I am not good with anyone telling me what to do. The minute someone does that just impulsively I'm gonna do the opposite. So <laugh>, it's kind of better just I've learned like, let me just be in my own little sphere. I'm gonna do it and I'll ideally, hopefully do it well, but, you know, don't, don't try to force me in a box that's not gonna end well for anybody. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well that's, that's pretty cool. And, and also it's, you know, again, some of that, it sounds like some of that is born from you getting to experience all sides of that track and, and yeah. Having the, having the balls to choose the one that feels right for you. That's cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>Yeah. Well, I credit my parents for that entirely. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that's, that's awesome. Yeah. So what is, what's in the, besides these two releases that you have coming out in, coming out shortly, or it may, they may be out by the time that this podcast airs. What else do you have in the hopper that you're working on right now? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>So, basically the second ep, the one that's the more rock, industrial, punishment EP that is the beginning of a longer project. I'm basically, I'm doing the next album and the next album is called Calliope. Okay. But I am initially releasing it EP by ep. And, since I'm self, I'm <span style="color:red" data-ts="2542.565" data-end_ts="2542.605" title="2542.565" id=c_"2542.565">__like__</span>, I'm doing <span style="color:red" data-ts="2542.845" data-end_ts="2542.885" title="2542.845" id=c_"2542.845">__it__</span> on my own label. I kind of all the freedom and to do anything I want, which is amazing. So every quarter, roughly every four months, something like that, there's gonna be a new three track ep. I'm just gonna do it digitally for the time being. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, just Spotify, and, you know, all that that'll culmin me ultimately in the full length. And that'll be physical and vinyl and be pretty. And it's just a way, this is just a way for me to actually create the album while keeping a dialogue going as opposed to disappearing off the face of the earth for a year and a half, which is very easy to do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>By that same token, I live by myself and I'm pretty much by myself 99% of the time. So having a dialogue, even if it's with a fan base on a personal level, is kind of healthy for me, just so I don't feel so alone. That is one of the ways I'm doing that. That's like the music side of it. It's coincidental. So I started actually recording a podcast to my own, a few months ago. And it's, the concept of that was always like, my favorite conversations ever are just when I'm having a beer with another musician. Right. So it's that with a microphone in front of it. Nice. And I've just been fortunate because a lot of my friends are pretty like successful musicians that they've all been willing to do it. So that's probably gonna, I mean, I've been pre-recording a bunch too. I've got about six of 'em right now, and that'll probably come out late April. But, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, let me know when you launch that and I'll make sure that, that I get listeners on board with that as well. That sounds, that sounds awesome. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>It's, it's been an experience. I've learned, I'm very good at talking about myself. I am not so good at caring a conversation about somebody else that has been, that's harder for me. This has been a really good, learning curve and, you know, actually how to be a better conversationalist. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. And 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>I mean, it's beneficial because every artist is narcissistic to some extent. I mean, I think you kind of have to be, to be an artist too, to actually believe that what you do will allow you to survive when you know you're not doing, you're not working within the machine. Fortunately, a lot of artists that I've approached, they've just been, they've loved, loved to do it because it gives them a platform to not only talk about, you know, what they are, but it's so rare that artists get to talk about who they are. Right. And for them to feel comfortable enough to be vulnerable, that's a challenge. So I think that's where the fact that I too am an artist, and I mean, I'm, I'm pretty open about my life at this point. So it allows for them to feel comfortable and allow them to be vulnerable at the same time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>It's been a really good experience. And I mean, <laugh>, I fucking sucked at it. The first few of them <laugh>. And now, now I feel like I'm getting better at guiding a conversation. 'cause the other problem I learned was, since I'm recording these, mostly with my friends, you know, if we're drinking while we're doing it, or, you know, in some cases people have been smoking, it's, it's not the most lucid conversation all the time, <laugh>. And so that's required a ton of editing on my behalf later. Right, right. And <laugh>, and a big part of that too was I wasn't comfortable doing it yet, and I'm still not a hundred percent comfortable. I'm like, this, I'm really green to this. The challenge has been <laugh>. I think it's because I'm doing it with my friends a hundred percent. Right, sure. Because then you have your own inside jokes and you have your own rapport, and it's easy just to start ragging on each other for 15 minutes straight <laugh> and then realize, you know, how isolating that can be. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>So I think when I start doing, you know, more artists who, I don't know as well, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2757.355" data-end_ts="2757.645" title="2757.355" id=c_"2757.355">__then__</span> the conversations are actually gonna become easier in a way because it's less silliness. So there's that. And then the last thing I'm doing, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2765.485" data-end_ts="2765.765" title="2765.485" id=c_"2765.485">__it's__</span> like I started just doing little, little gear profiles of things I use and it's just, little YouTube videos. I'm calling it Gear and what it means to me. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> because it sounds like an emo record <laugh>, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It sure does. That's awesome. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>So the first one is just like, make noise DPO and as opposed to, you know, there's so many YouTube tutorials out there, like, here is every feature of this thing. And I, I have no desire to do any of that. It's just like, in the case of the DPO, I love this module because it makes my favorite kick drums, and I love it for making Reese <span style="color:red" data-ts="2798.405" data-end_ts="2798.565" title="2798.405" id=c_"2798.405">__space__</span> lines, and this is why, and I'm trying to keep everything under five minutes, and it's just purely from the artist profile of it. Not, not so much check out every feature, go buy this thing. It's just like, I love this thing and this is why. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, that's, that's really smart. Yeah. I, I think a lot of times people when they talk about their gear, they, they focus on its utility, but I, I think guitarists have a better handle on this than recording people or synth people guitarists fall in love with their damn instrument. Right? Mm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>Oh man, I used to take mine to bed. Oh, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>When I got my first Les Paul. Oh, yeah. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And, I think that there's something to be said for saying if, if you're finding it difficult to fall in love with your instrument, maybe it's not just a lack of utility. Maybe there's just something intrinsic to that. I, I tease, someone was asking me about my modular and I was like, you know, I have bought and sold every module in my system. I have a very small system, but it's very densely packed. And I've sold, I've bought and sold every piece like three times because it's almost like, it, it's almost like, I'll get something because it sounds exciting. And they're like, well, I'm sure there's something that could do this better and I'll sell it. And then I'll be like, oh, you know, that fit in that space night, so I'll buy it again. And I'll be like, oh, I need something smaller and I'll sell it. And then finally I'm like, no, I can't fucking live without this thing, so I have to buy it. Right. Yeah. And then once it goes through that amount of process, now I know that this is a little thing that I love and it becomes really a part of an instrument for me. Then 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>What's your favorite module? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>DPO is probably pretty darn close, as is the maths. Yeah. The most recent, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>You can't have one without the 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Other. Yeah. I know the most recent thing that I bought for the third time was the mutable instrument braids. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. I have a love hate relationship with <span style="color:red" data-ts="2915.405" data-end_ts="2915.525" title="2915.405" id=c_"2915.405">__them__</span>, mostly related to, it's got a really low output level and I just have to learn it does deal. And, I was out in <span style="color:red" data-ts="2924.965" data-end_ts="2925.165" title="2924.965" id=c_"2924.965">__bur__</span> out at Berkeley a couple of weeks ago for that Voltage Connect thing that they had, and I was talking to 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>Oh, that's right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Yeah. I was talking to my friend Matthew Davidson, who teaches out there now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>Right. That sounds so familiar. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. He's the guy, he goes under the artist named Stretta a lot. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>Yes, of course. Right. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And he's teaching out there now. And, he used to work with me and we were just sitting around talking about modules and, and he said, so now they have physical modules that they modulars that they teach with. Yep. And he said the thing that turned it around for him was the O'Toole oscilloscope module. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>Really? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You know, in my small system, I certainly have a space that may that's there for that module as well, simply because it always makes me feel connected with a signal flow, the signal flow in an intellectual way where the rest of the thing is kind of more like, a visceral connection to the signal flow. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> by pumping things through that oscilloscope, I always feel like, oh, and there's this intellectual benefit too. I can see the wave shaping happening, or I can see that I'm not getting any audio, so it's, I screwed up something. Right. But yeah, I don't, interesting. I've got, I've got this little, I have one of those little tiptop fold open cases. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And it's now kind of filled up with all my favorite modules. But again, it's been a process of buying and selling each one a couple of times until it really like passes muster. Right. It's a Right. It's quite a not your process. Ridiculous. It's a, yeah, it's a ridiculous process, but it's what seems to have worked for me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>It's funny, I feel like I've maxed out on Euro. Yeah. So now I just, I'm just obsessed with guitar pedals right now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, you know, that's a, that's a thing a lot of people are kind of making that move, thankfully, because some of it is because there's some really exciting stuff going on in the <span style="color:red" data-ts="3036.445" data-end_ts="3036.605" title="3036.445" id=c_"3036.445">__pedal__</span> world. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>And you know, it's not even, and a lot of modular makers come, or eurorack manufacturers, a lot of 'em come from the pedal world. Right. Since I've also been, you know, working more on like more traditional, kinda like the rock industrial thing. I'm playing so much guitar right now. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and remembering the sheer joy of just playing with a delay pedal. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>I mean, I mean, there's <laugh> like, and just the tactile response of, you know, bending a note and hearing the delay trail on it, and it gets, it blurs all together and long feedback and there's, I'm getting a joy out of just guitars and pedals that I haven't felt in forever. So I'm just on a fuzz pedal kick right now though. Oh, interesting. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3078.925" data-end_ts="3079.125" title="3078.925" id=c_"3078.925">__And__</span>, and 'cause it's great for the modular too. Really. Any, I mean, one of my favorite things I did recently was just taking a, a <span style="color:red" data-ts="3086.765" data-end_ts="3087.005" title="3086.765" id=c_"3086.765">__string__</span>, like a string sample. It was like a low brass la scoring strings, or not a low base and pitch shifting thing down, a whole octave. So you know, it's really low and rumble and you hear like the string, you know, slapping against the fret. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> taking that really low and then recording both the left and right channels individually through this, this <span style="color:red" data-ts="3108.515" data-end_ts="3108.805" title="3108.515" id=c_"3108.515">__devy__</span> ever <span style="color:red" data-ts="3109.005" data-end_ts="3109.245" title="3109.005" id=c_"3109.005">__pedal__</span> I have called, the big distortion sound machine. And full disclosure, I bought it because I was in a store and had two cats wrestling on it. <laugh> and and but then the knob said, ruiner ruin or gain ruiner volume, and then there's a switch for better or worse. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, nice. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>So I'm like, I have to try it, you know? Right. <laugh>. So, I picked it up and I just, they had a, they had an old Model D just in the back, so I just hooked it up to the Moog and was, you know, within three seconds of what the fuck, like, this was the most aggressive thing I had ever heard, so I had to buy it. And, well, now 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Started be careful though, because you saying that out loud means that now, starting, starting about two months from now, and then for the next two years, every single distortion pedal <span style="color:red" data-ts="3160.705" data-end_ts="3160.925" title="3160.705" id=c_"3160.705">__is__</span> gonna have a better or worse switch on it. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>Right. I'm fine with that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The dude bought it off of that. Maybe that's, maybe that's a marketing plan, right? <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>Hey, well, you know what it, well, it's cool too 'cause I guess <span style="color:red" data-ts="3172.465" data-end_ts="3172.885" title="3172.465" id=c_"3172.465">__Debbie__</span> ever herself, she wasn't making them at the time. It was this company Dwarf <span style="color:red" data-ts="3176.085" data-end_ts="3176.325" title="3176.085" id=c_"3176.085">__Craft__</span>. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And they, they had the rights to that brand at that time. So they were making all those pedals. Oh, okay. And consequently, I looked into Dwarf <span style="color:red" data-ts="3184.685" data-end_ts="3184.925" title="3184.685" id=c_"3184.685">__Craft__</span> after, and like I just fell in love with them as a company. Oh, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3189.365" data-end_ts="3189.485" title="3189.365" id=c_"3189.365">__wow__</span>. Because it actually resonates with my parents, because Dwarf <span style="color:red" data-ts="3193.285" data-end_ts="3193.525" title="3193.285" id=c_"3193.285">__Craft__</span> is a husband and wife team building all these crazy pedals together. The one I got after was called the, the Eau Claire Thunder. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And they're from Eau Claire <span style="color:red" data-ts="3201.085" data-end_ts="3201.285" title="3201.085" id=c_"3201.085">__was__</span> Wisconsin. Right. Just 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Down <span style="color:red" data-ts="3202.405" data-end_ts="3202.605" title="3202.405" id=c_"3202.405">__on__</span> the road <span style="color:red" data-ts="3202.835" data-end_ts="3203.125" title="3202.835" id=c_"3202.835">__from__</span> me. Actually, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>You should hit them up then, because they're right there. I should. And, and this thing was just like Mega Fuzz <laugh>. And the first time I, I, like, I took, you know, aside from guitar stuff, but, you know, I took like A-A-D-P-O Reese or a Sch Wayman Reese or something and threw it through the Eau Claire Thunder and it was just, holy fuck. That is brutal. I had to get that. And then I just got this one called, the Necromancer Uhhuh, which is another crazy fuzz they make, but it <span style="color:red" data-ts="3231.125" data-end_ts="3231.325" title="3231.125" id=c_"3231.125">__has__</span>, the artwork was done by this guy <span style="color:red" data-ts="3232.805" data-end_ts="3232.925" title="3232.805" id=c_"3232.805">__who__</span> used to work on that, cartoon Metalocalypse. Yes. And it was like this perfect, you know, I'm just getting so much joy out of this stuff. And then the even <span style="color:red" data-ts="3242.285" data-end_ts="3242.565" title="3242.285" id=c_"3242.285">__Tide__</span> pedals too are, you know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="3245.065" data-end_ts="3245.285" title="3245.065" id=c_"3245.065">__On__</span>. And I love even <span style="color:red" data-ts="3246.285" data-end_ts="3246.525" title="3246.285" id=c_"3246.285">__Tide__</span>, everything. So now having 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>'em all <span style="color:red" data-ts="3248.285" data-end_ts="3248.325" title="3248.285" id=c_"3248.285">__<crosstalk>__</span>. Yeah. I I have to, I have to admit that, there's, and, and actually the format of the pedal now is, is preferable to me even to their rack devices. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> the way, the amount of control that they give you, but kind of the compact nature of it. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. I love this, this series of pedals they put out, they're, they're amazing. Oh 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>Yeah. I'm, I'm loving it. I mean, 'cause I have an old DS P 4,000 mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I've had it for eight years. It's funny. I mean, I, it pretty much always just lived on like the black hole re algorithm <laugh> and for years, I mean, I would, it would just sit on that one setting. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And then I'd run everything through it, pads, vocals, what have you. Right, right. And now being able to have that in pedal form as well as all the other ones, but I can tweak it in real time. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And then, like the pitch factor is amazing for IDM kind of percussion. Yeah. Or I'll use braids a lot for weird, like glitchy percussion. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and like using meta <span style="color:red" data-ts="3302.405" data-end_ts="3302.685" title="3302.405" id=c_"3302.405">__mode__</span> and pitch shifting and all sorts of things. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and sending that through the pitch factor and just running it on a micro <span style="color:red" data-ts="3309.165" data-end_ts="3309.485" title="3309.165" id=c_"3309.165">__shift__</span>, doubling kind of setting you get your little glitchy becomes so nice and stereo and liquidy and just to have more things to play with. Like, it just, I get so excited about it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. That's cool. Yeah. That's really interesting. So do you ever mess around with loopers much <span style="color:red" data-ts="3328.105" data-end_ts="3328.325" title="3328.105" id=c_"3328.105">__and__</span>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>Have you, you 
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>Only 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="3332.645" data-end_ts="3333.005" title="3332.645" id=c_"3332.645">__Because__</span> if you haven't, I'll tell you that's your next turn If you're, if you're in <span style="color:red" data-ts="3336.645" data-end_ts="3336.685" title="3336.645" id=c_"3336.645">__the__</span> pedal

</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Ah, this, okay. Which one did you, or which one did you drop into? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>Well, the Eventide time factor has a looper. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3344.885" data-end_ts="3345.005" title="3344.885" id=c_"3344.885">__Right__</span>? Oh 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>I remember like years and years and years, like as a guitarist in high school with like, there was that line six four looper. Right. And then, or, and or there's the boss RC 22. Oh man. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. I was so like into the idea of that, but then like Ableton Live happened and you could kinda loop on the fly using logic or whatever I was using at the time. Again, I was so in the box and just recently this act, I think I got these pedals on Monday, all the even type <span style="color:red" data-ts="3370.445" data-end_ts="3370.565" title="3370.445" id=c_"3370.445">__of__</span> ones. Yeah. And, <laugh>. Yeah. Just looping things I'm playing over and overdubbing and Right. Oh man. Is it addictive? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So let me give you a, let me give you a heads up on something. We need to wrap up, but let me give you <span style="color:red" data-ts="3385.125" data-end_ts="3385.245" title="3385.125" id=c_"3385.125">__a__</span> heads up on something because, they're about to become unobtainium. It's a pedal called the Boomerang. The Boomerang <span style="color:red" data-ts="3392.605" data-end_ts="3392.845" title="3392.605" id=c_"3392.605">__three__</span>. Yeah, I know that sampler. Okay. Yeah. Most people don't know it, but Boomerang, the guy who runs it has decided he's done, he's trying to sell the company, but subsequently they have been making 'em lately. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>Right. Fair enough. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And they're getting to be really rare. But the nice thing about it's, first of all, it's really kind of a simple interface, but depending on what order you load the loops, you can either have the loops be in tight synchronization like every other looper. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Or you can have the three or four channels of looping be completely desynchronized. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>Huh. 
</p>

<b>Darwin: </b>So now all of a sudden you build something, you know, one is like one, one loop cycle, and then the next one is like one <span style="color:red" data-ts="3434.045" data-end_ts="3434.205" title="3434.045" id=c_"3434.045">__and__</span> three eighths of a looping cycle, and the other one is like two and four fifths of a cycle, you know? Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3441.365" data-end_ts="3441.565" title="3441.365" id=c_"3441.365">__And__</span> you get these crazy cool looping things, and I'll tell you man, it doesn't matter whether I've got the, whether I have the modular plugged in or if I'm playing my guitar through my boss pedal set, or I throw the bass on there, or I plug a microphone in and, and Yelp into it no matter what, I seem to be able to come up with stuff that just makes, just makes my soul sore. Right. I'm not sure that I would ever let anyone else hear it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>Yeah, sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But for me it's, it's almost spiritual <span style="color:red" data-ts="3473.465" data-end_ts="3473.685" title="3473.465" id=c_"3473.465">__in__</span>, in how amazing. It's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>So, I mean, that's what it's all about right there though. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It seems like it, yeah. It's, that's, that's why we end up really focusing on doing this stuff. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>Totally. I mean, that's what we're all searching for ultimately. It's just that feeling all the time. It's a drug. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. True enough. But 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>Yeah, that's exactly what it is. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Hey Matt, boy. There you go. We just, went off on a rambler there. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>Yeah. That's fun. Hey man, just bring up gear, you know, it happens. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, right. But you know what, I have to tell you, I really appreciate you talking also about sort of like the struggles get through, because in a way, the gear thing can, can be kind of a, kind of a distracting conversation, right? It's, it can be one of those things where like, I don't have to be, I don't have to like drop my pants too far because we're just talking about gear, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>Yeah. No, well that's, it's, it's so safe. It 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Is. Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3529.285" data-end_ts="3529.325" title="3529.285" id=c_"3529.285">__But__</span> I appreciate you talking about kind of the, the grittier stuff of this stuff too, because that's, that's the real world and that's, everybody ends up having to confront that stuff eventually anyway, so I appreciate you being willing to talk about it, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>Man. Oh, I'm, I'm happy to. I'm embracing being open. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>There you go. Apparently. So, so well with that then I'm going to let you get on with the rest of your day. Thank you so much for hanging out and talking. I really appreciate it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Matt: </b>Oh, it's my pleasure. Thank you. Alright, 
</p>
