<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today I have the great pleasure of getting to know somebody. Her name is Bonna Jafar. She's talking to us from a nice, outdoor coffee shop in la I am, of course, in my freezing basement in Minneapolis. So I'm very, I'm both sensitive about the cold and I am very, envious of being able to sit outside and drink some coffee. So, with that, I'll say hi <span style="color:red" data-ts="48.805" data-end_ts="49.045" title="48.805" id=c_"48.805">__upon__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="49.075" data-end_ts="49.365" title="49.075" id=c_"49.075">__upon__</span>. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bana Haffar: </b>I'm fine, thank you. Thank you so much for, having me on your podcast. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, thank you. I'm, I'm really excited. I got introduced to you by Tom Hall, at the NAMM Show, and he's very, he kinda like banged on me about five times. You gotta do it, you gotta do it, man. So when he's excited about something, I get excited about something. So I'm really glad that, we're having this opportunity to talk. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bana: </b>Likewise. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright, so, to kick off with, and for all the listeners, why don't we start off with you talking a little bit about your work, what kind of things you've been doing lately? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bana: </b>Lately I have, kind of delved into the world of, modular synthesizers, in the, Eurorack format specifically. And, I have been starting to play live shows and, recording music solo, modular music, and, really trying to, trying to learn synthesis through synthesis by, by way of modular synthesizers, applying my, knowledge of music from my days of playing bass and violin, and kind of seeing how, how certain things, translate, into the world of synthesis. And, you know, I'm still, in the beginning of my journey, in the, in the synth world. Yeah. I've just kind of been, exploring modulars now and, really enjoying it <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Yeah. It's, it's pretty fun. And I'll have to, I'll have to say that I, I've been working with modulars since for the better part of 20 years now, and I feel like I'm still a beginner in it. It is one of those kind of environments that seems, seems to make, make you a beginner all the time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bana: </b>Right? Definitely, definitely. And that's, even, even if you don't use a piece of gear for several months, you know, some, some of these, some of these modules are a whole universe. There, there are a whole universe. <span style="color:red" data-ts="168.705" data-end_ts="168.715" title="168.705" id=c_"168.705">__They're__</span>, they're a whole universe. And, it takes a lot of time and dedication, just like any, any other instrument. But it definitely, it's not something that you ever really get comfortable with, like a guitar or something where you have your muscle memory and you can pick up the instrument and always get the same lines or whatever. This, it's, it's definitely a very fickle and, challenging instrument. <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Fickle is a great word for it. Yeah, that's, that's a good call. Now, before getting into synthesis, you were primarily a bass player, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bana: </b>Yeah, I played bass for, probably close to a decade. I did that full time. I was just a, a bass mercenary, as you would call it, <laugh>. I, I was a, I was a hired gun, right. I, I went to school for bass and, music per performance. And then I, after school I was, you know, subsequently funneled into what I call the musical industrial complex <laugh> and, and the world of pop music and all this stuff that I was not enjoying, but I just got sucked into it because I needed to pay my rent. Sure. So I just started just playing for different artists and touring and doing a fair amount of session work. And yeah, I did that for, yeah, about, about a decade. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Where did you go to school? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bana: </b>I, I studied in France for two years at a small school in northeastern France. I wanted to do, French and music at the same time. I thought it was a good idea to, study music in a foreign country where I barely spoke the language, <laugh>. So I was pretty lost for the first several months. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, I was gonna say, that seems like, that seems like taking a disadvantage and adding a disadvantage to it. Totally. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bana: </b>That's kind of my style sometimes. I don't know why <laugh>, I just throw myself into very uncomfortable situations and, and, and see how I do. It worked out well though. I mean, I did kind of gain a language somewhat like French, and it was, it was a good learning experience being at a foreign environment, and, and it was a very beautiful city and, you know, a lot of good came out of that. And, and then I came to LA and I continued my studies at Musicians Institute in, in la. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Very cool school. Now, you talk about putting yourself in uncomfortable positions, being sort of your stock and trade. And on one hand you claim to be sort of just beginning your journey with, with modulars and Synthesis. Yet you find yourself as sort of a video star for Moog music. How'd that happen? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bana: </b>I also find that a little strange, but, it happened through a connection. My, my partner Eric Chela, who's also a phenomenal synthesist, knew, somebody over at Moog. And they were looking for people to kind of like fresh, I guess, fresh faces to demo the, the Moog mother 32. And somehow my name was kind of, thrown in there and they reached out and asked me if I wanted to fly to Asheville and, you know, go to the Moog Sound lab and just make some, make some jams and make some patches on this, on this new piece of gear. And my first instinct was, no, of course not. I mean, I, I don't know what I'm doing, <laugh>. Why, why would you ask me? I, I just started this. And they kind of convinced me, and, and I, and I also had kind of a, a conversation with myself and just said that, just, just say yes and, and figure it out later. If they asked you, then there might be a reason why they asked you and just go and see what happens. And it, and it was awesome. And I guess the product became quite successful. I mean, it's a, it's a great piece of gear and the, the internet's a funny place. <laugh>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="394.385" data-end_ts="394.605" title="394.385" id=c_"394.385">__you__</span>, you never know what, what videos blow up or what threads or blogs or I guess I try not to pay too much attention to it and just, I, I have too many modules to learn <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I hear that. Well, I thought it was a really effective video for two reasons. First of all, because it was a very, it was a very musical thing. A lot of times people, that are doing modular work get so excited about things like modulation and inter modular, inner modular distortion and all this kind of stuff that they sort of forget the musicality part of it. And I thought that you really brought that in a nice way. But secondly, it was interesting to see a video shot in MOG Labs that had other modules in it. It was, it was actually a really smart move on everyone's part to say, yeah, it's a MOG piece, but it interacts with the rest of this community's work, which was kind of new for MOG at the time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bana: </b>Yeah, definitely. And I think something that they really wanted to, illustrate through these videos was that, was that the mother 32 interfaces really well with the Eurorack format, you know, especially since it has the 32 point patch Bay that you can use the, the same, eighth inch patch cables. Right. So that's something that they wanted to, to really demonstrate. And I felt more comfortable having my <span style="color:red" data-ts="477.805" data-end_ts="477.925" title="477.805" id=c_"477.805">__U__</span> Rack rig there also, because, you know, I wasn't at the point that I made the video, I was still pretty, pretty new to that piece of gear, so. Sure. So it, it made it easier for me to make a piece with my small u rack rig that I'm already familiar with. Right. And then, and then hook up <span style="color:red" data-ts="496.445" data-end_ts="496.765" title="496.445" id=c_"496.445">__another__</span> 32 and kind of, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="499.075" data-end_ts="499.365" title="499.075" id=c_"499.075">__Kind__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bana: </b>Of extend the work. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Yeah, I, I've noticed something interesting, first of all, that across the world of, of music production and music creation, it seems like oftentimes bass players end up really extending themselves into other things. A lot of times, when I talk to people who are kind of delving into synthesis deep, you would think that it would be a keyboardist thing, but so often it's a bass player who sort of is like expanding their repertoire by, by working with synthesizers. Right. A lot of production people come from being a bass, being bass players. What do you think it is about the bass that lends itself to that, and how do you personally kind of bring the, bring the music background that you learned on the bass? How do you bring that into synthesis and especially your performing work? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bana: </b>I'm not sure about other bass pairs, but I know that in, in my situation, I was introduced to synthesizers through playing bass because I, I bought a, a voyager that was my first synthesizer. And I, and I bought that synth because I, I wanted to start playing key bass Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, on, on recording sessions and then taking it live. And, so I figured that I need to step my game up and kind of branch out and, and I, I need to get some kind of a synth so I can start playing key <span style="color:red" data-ts="582.965" data-end_ts="583.165" title="582.965" id=c_"582.965">__base__</span> lines, because that's, that's what the gig's called for Sure. And I was very much entrenched in that world. Unfortunately, at that time, I'm, I'm glad that, that I am now kind of out of it through synthesizers. But so, yeah, I got my, Moog Voyager, and then I started to become more interested in the tone shaping. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bana: </b>'cause I thought originally that I was gonna get it and then just learn all these key <span style="color:red" data-ts="607.525" data-end_ts="607.725" title="607.525" id=c_"607.525">__base__</span> lines and just become more, more proficient at playing the keyboard. Right. And that never happened. I just, I discovered the, the switch on the voyager that you can just keep the VCA on <laugh>, just have it drone. Right. And I never touched the keyboard <laugh>, and I was just, I was turning all the knobs and I was like, wow, this is so much more fun and interesting than just trying to play bass lines on this amazing synthesizer that makes the coolest sounds. So I only have so much time in the day, and I'm going to, you know, dedicate it actually to, to the tone shaping of the instrument, versus just learning key bass lines, which seems kind of like a waste, or, I thought it was. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So how long did it take you to go from the preset signal flow of the voyager to the completely un preset nature of the modular synth? What was your, what was your path there and, and, how long did it take you to get there? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bana: </b>So I had my voyager for about, I'll say like, almost, almost a year. And then as I got more into the, the front panel of the instrument voices, the, the, the black and white keyboard, I started to research modular synthesizers more. I remember, I, I, I had a night where I was up really late just kind of playing with sounds. And then I texted a friend of mine who's an amazing keyboard player. His name is Peter Dyer. And I was like, you know, or he's, he's my like, synth guru at the time. And I was like, wow. You know, the, I wish there was an instrument that I could play that didn't have a black and white keyboard, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="699.645" data-end_ts="699.805" title="699.645" id=c_"699.645">__that__</span> was just all about the knobs, you know? Right, right. And then he just texted me back, this was like three in the morning or something, and texted me back, like, Don Buchla. That was it. I was like, whoa, <laugh>. So I kind of like started researching, you know, that's, that's how I found out about modular synthesizers. I mean, I didn't know what a modular was. I barely knew what a synthesizer 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Was. Right. Then you ran across all the stuff about the tyranny of the keyboard and stuff, and kind of took it from there, huh? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bana: </b>Yeah. Yeah. And that was totally in line with how I was feeling at the time, and just, just really questioning why we have this black and white keyboard, or, or just how, how a certain interface kind of dictates our perception of an instrument and how it would be interesting to remove a familiar interface and just have an interface that's completely alien, and that's not tied to any, any kind of a, repertoire or system of thought. And then try and make music with that. And then I, I saw the movie I Dream of Wires also that, I mean, I think that was kind of like a gateway drug to modular. Also, the day that I went to see that movie, there was a eurorack system sitting in the movie theater. My current partner Eric Chela, he was the gentleman who was demoing this <span style="color:red" data-ts="774.805" data-end_ts="775.365" title="774.805" id=c_"774.805">__eurorack__</span> rig. And it was the first time that I ever came into contact with a modular synthesizer. And that was it. I, I, I just realized that this is exactly what I've been looking for. This is, this is the most amazing instrument and unlike anything I've ever played with before. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's really interesting to hear that you came at this from a very musicianly standpoint. You know, having studied, seriously studied a standard instrument, gotten good enough to be able to do session work and live playing and stuff. But you end up getting drawn into the creation of Tams as, as something interesting. And I, so that kind of implies to me, kind of a, an interesting story of some sort. One of the things I like to do in my podcast is talk to people about how they got to be the musicians or artists that they are. And I'm curious, in your case, what is your story? Did you grow up with in a very artistic life? Did you grow up in not, did you have someone that was your guide through the process? I, I'm curious about how you got where you are. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bana: </b>I was, you know, interestingly enough, or maybe not, I was, I was born in Saudi Arabia, and I, and I lived most of my life in the Middle East in Gulf countries. And so that definitely limited my exposure to a lot of music that my friends in, in the US were exposed to, especially electronic music. There wasn't really much of that. It was, it was kind of hard getting music in the Middle East, actually, especially in Saudi Arabia. There was very, you know, heavy censorship. So I grew up learning how to play piano and, violin with relatively limited exposure to a lot of music that I, I almost wish that I had been exposed to it earlier. But everybody gets, dealt a different hand of cards in life, and you have to, sure enough, so I, I played violin for, for many years. I, I went through a very kind of rigorous violin program with this, it was the Royal Music School of London, this kind of pretty intense violin program with a lot of, exams and theory and just, you know, it wasn't really fun. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bana: </b>It was pretty, exhausting for a kid. Yeah. But, and then I transitioned into playing bass, and I was living in Dubai at the time. I, I started playing bass in, in bands in Dubai, and I started playing actually in, in death metal bands in Dubai. Okay. 'cause there, I, I knew that I didn't wanna play pop music at the time, and I mean, I didn't <span style="color:red" data-ts="931.285" data-end_ts="931.405" title="931.285" id=c_"931.285">__know__</span>, I didn't know how to play the instrument, but I just, I signed myself up for a death metal band and, just started playing around town and just learning how to play the instrument through playing gigs and really sucking for a long time. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's, I, I'm sure that's the way it felt, but you had to be coming to a certain amount, coming with a certain amount of musical knowledge given your background with violin. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bana: </b>Yeah. I, I've, I've always had a good ear so I can catch things Right. Pretty quickly. And then the, and then the technical knowhow kind of catches up later. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>First of all, I have to say the phrase death metal in Dubai, I mean, there's like a another band name right there, right. <laugh> beyond 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bana: </b>That. Yeah. We used to play in like, parking lots, and it was, it was a weird scene. It was very limited, you know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I can imagine 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bana: </b>In the Middle East. And even, even getting music was, again, it was difficult. And I remember whenever we would travel to the US or, or, or Europe, I would kind of stock up, I would accumulate a list of CDs that I would wanna buy throughout the year just by scraping on the internet. And Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> from what I could hear, and then I would, I would, I would buy them like once, once a year when we would leave the Middle East and I would have access and then try and get them into the country without having them confiscated at the airport. And yeah, it was, it was challenging for, you know, people who weren't into the mainstream. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'll bet. Beyond that though, what is it about death <span style="color:red" data-ts="1022.405" data-end_ts="1022.725" title="1022.405" id=c_"1022.405">__battle__</span> that drew you in? Was it, was it culturally a fit? Did it seem like music that you could cope with? Was it just the kind of attitude you were looking for at the time? What, what drove you that direction? I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bana: </b>Think, I think it was kind of a combination of all of those things. You know, I was always attracted to just the subculture, and even though it wasn't as intense of a subculture as it is in the, in the US it was kind of what we had there. Right. And, you know, that and being, being an angry teenager obviously helps <laugh>, and I was just, I was, I was into that music. I was into heavier, darker music at that time. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But I, I mean, I was also listening to like, weather Report and Miles Davis at the same time. So it's, I guess from a bass player standpoint, I just, I just, enjoyed all of, all of the unison lines, and all of my friends were kind of in that scene as well. So <span style="color:red" data-ts="1079.665" data-end_ts="1079.885" title="1079.665" id=c_"1079.665">__it__</span>, there were a multitude of reasons that I kind of ended up there 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right now. At some point though, I mean, first of all, just doing death metal, there's, there's enough technical, there's enough of a need for technical expertise that you must <span style="color:red" data-ts="1093.765" data-end_ts="1093.965" title="1093.765" id=c_"1093.765">__have__</span> had to get some chops on the instrument fairly fast, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bana: </b>Yeah. I mean, I definitely practiced a lot and, you know, trying to keep up with the, with the Iron Cobra double bass pedal <laugh>, yeah, it's very, very strange days. It's, it's even strange telling you about this, <laugh>. I, I don't really talk about this, but 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, but it's, it's really, it's really interesting because, I mean, in a way, again, I always find it interesting that the people whose work I, I appreciate and whose, perspectives I appreciate often have these really improbable stories. Right. And I think the reason is, is because if you're, if you're coming right down the center line of life, you're going to share, you're gonna share your perspectives and your view on the world with everybody else. But if you sort of, like, if you sort of like fell in the ditch early in the game and you spent the rest of your time struggling to get out, you're gonna have a very different perspective of things than everyone else. And that's a result. It's more than likely you're gonna have a pretty unique voice. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bana: </b>Yeah. I, you know, I try and remind myself of that because again, like I said earlier, I, sometimes I, I, I feel a little frustrated that I wasn't exposed to like, really cool electronic music when I was younger. And I feel like, oh, I kind of wasted a lot of time just playing like really terrible pop music, but you know, better, better late than never. Better 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Late than <span style="color:red" data-ts="1182.845" data-end_ts="1183.045" title="1182.845" id=c_"1182.845">__never__</span>. Indeed. Yeah. So, one of the things that I do know about you is that you, along with Eric, have been involved in, this live performance system that every, everyone from Everywhere talks about, which is the modular on the spot performance, events, right? Yeah. Do you often perform at them or do you just kind of help with coordination? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bana: </b>So, Eric and I started that event probably about a year and a half ago, Uhhuh <affirmative>. So we, we have every third Thursday of the month. Okay. We've only had one month that we've missed that in <span style="color:red" data-ts="1219.605" data-end_ts="1219.805" title="1219.605" id=c_"1219.605">__these__</span>, in <span style="color:red" data-ts="1220.045" data-end_ts="1220.245" title="1220.045" id=c_"1220.045">__these__</span>, in the year and a half that we started it. And we sometimes play it, but it's more for our friends and anybody, anybody who wants to do it. You know, the only, the only caveat is that they play an all modular set Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And it's always outdoors and it's always free. And the reason that we keep it all modular is not because we're, you know, like we're not trying to be difficult. We're just trying to keep the event focused because there are so many electronic events in LA already that have people on laptops and using various kinds of hardware. And we just wanted to keep it just kind of a low key and very focused event. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I think it's an interesting spin for two reasons. First of all, the concept of doing an an outdoor mobile gig with modular synth is sort of so ridiculous that it's sweet. I mean, <laugh>, excuse me for saying it that way, but Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bana: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1269.765" data-end_ts="1269.805" title="1269.765" id=c_"1269.765">__Yeah__</span>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1269.805" data-end_ts="1269.845" title="1269.805" id=c_"1269.805">__This__</span>, it's ridiculous. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It, it's, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bana: </b>We have people, I mean, you know, getting to these spots is not, it's not like there's a paved road and, and like a load-in section <span style="color:red" data-ts="1278.585" data-end_ts="1278.805" title="1278.585" id=c_"1278.585">__and__</span> like, like a load-in zone, you know, you have to kind of like walk through a ditch and go through some mud and walk down a hill and, and these people like bring their pretty expensive scents out there, and they're totally like, psyched to do it. Right. You know, we have people bringing out booklets and surges and like Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know, it's, it's pretty ridiculous and, and so awesome at the same time. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But the other thing I would say is that a lot of people now are starting to sort of look at the modular as kind of being, I don't know, almost being like one of the first electronic music instruments that's sort of a folk instrument in that it kind of goes to the way back development of folk instrumentation, where people would actually be part of your work would be making your own instrument, which is something that every one of us that have a modular is obsessed with. You know, how do we make our instrument? How do we improve it? How do we get to, to know how to play it better? How do we learn how to play it in the dark where it, you know, it seems like an impossible task. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bana: </b>Yeah. And how do we learn how to play it live? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. And how do we do it without all the crutches that Ableton live or, you know, 50 sequencers or a string of 20 effects plugins provides. Right. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bana: </b>50 sequencers sounds amazing. I wish I had 50 sequences. That's why I need to get better at like software stuff, because <laugh> Yeah. I would love to have 50 sequencers. I have three, and it's never enough. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. I hear <span style="color:red" data-ts="1365.325" data-end_ts="1365.445" title="1365.325" id=c_"1365.325">__you__</span>. Let's talk a little bit about what your instrument looks like since this is kind of, you know, you're in the process of developing this for yourself. I think it'll be interesting to talk about the development of the instrument, because again, as sort of a folk instrument, the development of what you have under your fingers ends up being really important. And I know for myself, I have this crazy history in building my modular where it's sort of like, a module isn't really part of the instrument until I've bought it and sold it like three times. You know, <laugh>, I have to, I have to get it, love it, and then hate it and sell it, and then realize I miss it, and then buy, you know, I've got that whole thing <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bana: </b>Now. I was just, is that, is that what I have in store for me? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I don't know. Is that because, because the flip side of it is, I was just out in LA and I was talking to, talking to a friend, and he was talking about his system. He is like, you know, I have never sold a module because I'm absolutely terrified that I'm gonna sell it and then realize that's exactly what I need, so I have to keep on getting a bigger house <laugh> in order to fit my modules. And I was like, okay, well, there's the opposite of me. Right. But people seem to have this, you know, they build up almost a mythology behind the, the building of their synthesizer. That becomes really an important part of how that becomes an instrument for them. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bana: </b>Yeah. And it's interesting, the, there is a heavy, like, consumeristic aspect of modular <span style="color:red" data-ts="1455.725" data-end_ts="1456.005" title="1455.725" id=c_"1455.725">__sense__</span>, and you have people who just buy them for the sake of buying them and don't necessarily make any music with them. Right. That's another, that's a whole other issue. You know, that's something that I, I see, I see in this world of modular sense. And I, it kind of bothers me because I, I just feel that, you know, you could make cool music with like a skiff, you know, just one small row. You don't, you don't need like a village of modules. And, for me, my system is, it's a bit of a Franken system, obviously. Like, like everybody else, I use modules from a lot of different manufacturers. But lately, I, decided to use all, all make noise and see what it would be like to just build a system that was one manufacturer Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bana: </b><affirmative>. And, to see, see if I would patch differently or if it would inspire me to think differently if I didn't have certain modules that were my crutch modules. Some, modular players are very much a fan of just having a closed system. Right. And not, and not buying and selling and trading. They just buy their, their, their closed instrument and they, and they limit themselves, to that system and then make a record with it and, and that's it. And move on instead of constantly tinkering and switching in modules out. I'm kind of in the middle uhhuh, I'm <span style="color:red" data-ts="1533.485" data-end_ts="1533.525" title="1533.485" id=c_"1533.485">__kind__</span> of in the middle and I'm still trying to find my way, but I, I definitely, I don't buy modules very, very often. Right. I, I'm trying to dig <span style="color:red" data-ts="1542.155" data-end_ts="1542.445" title="1542.155" id=c_"1542.155">__into__</span> what I have, and I'm a fan of limitations. Yeah. And I feel that, that it's necessary to just pull the hand, break up at a point <laugh> and just be like, okay, this is, this is what I have. Let me learn this inside out and try and make the sounds that I need to make with, with what I have. And just try and figure out how to make 'em, instead of just being like, oh, well I can't, I can't make this patch because I don't have this specific module. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So how has this experiment gone, the experiment of using just make noise? Do you feel good about it? Do you, are you missing, you talk about previous crutch modules, what were some of those and, how badly do you feel like you, you're gonna need to return to that in some way? I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bana: </b>Guess some of the crutch modules were maybe some of the percussion sounds that I would use. Maybe like a kick a kick module or like a snare module or something like that. I see. Right. So, you know, instead of having the plug and play sounds just to really make, make all of the sounds from, from scratch. So I definitely, it's, it's, made me a little more creative in terms of my percussive sounds I feel. And, and it's just, it's, it's been, it's been really fun because you really feel like you kind of get into the mind of the creator. I feel like each module and each and each brand is really a reflection of the designer behind it. And they all have such different philosophies that it's, it is interesting just to stick with one, one at a time and just kind of try and understand what their, what, like what the ethos of their company is almost. And, and because the, you know, also with, with modular synthesizers, the front panels and the, and the interfaces are, they can also dictate your perception and the way that you patch and certain, certain face plates are a little wackier than than others. Right. And, I really love the make noise artwork, but I use other manufacturers too that I, that I love as well. It's just kind of, I just mix it up. I guess 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>One of the things I noticed that is kind of almost ubiquitous, and this is particularly in the case of people I know that are working out of la it seems like all LA modular synth people have a clouds in their system because it's somehow the clouds module is like the sound of LA modular, right. The big kissy granular sizzle thing. Yeah. Right. But it does point to another thing which is there that they're almost like two sets of people. One <span style="color:red" data-ts="1693.835" data-end_ts="1694.125" title="1693.835" id=c_"1693.835">__that__</span> where, where their modular system also has a lot of effects in it, you know, where the effects become a big part of the sound and other people Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> that really use it as a synthesis <span style="color:red" data-ts="1705.205" data-end_ts="1705.525" title="1705.205" id=c_"1705.205">__focused__</span> thing. Which, which end of that are you in? Which, where do you, where do you lie in terms of having effects be part of your euro <span style="color:red" data-ts="1714.185" data-end_ts="1714.405" title="1714.185" id=c_"1714.185">__at__</span>? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bana: </b>Well, first of all, I don't, I don't have a clouds yet, <laugh>. Oh, I don't, I don't have any, I don't have any, I don't have any, any mutable yet. I haven't, I haven't. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1721.605" data-end_ts="1721.805" title="1721.605" id=c_"1721.605">__Oh__</span>, okay. You know, dove into the mutable world yet, but I know, I mean, I've obviously, I'm, I'm familiar with them and I've, I've, I've heard those modules and they, and they do sound amazing. Yeah. I, like I said, I'm just digging into to the modules that I have already. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, in terms of effects, I kind of go back and forth. Sometimes I keep everything contained in my system. So my reverbs and my delays and everything is in my enclave box. Right. And then sometimes I, you know, I'll have external effects. Like I use the even <span style="color:red" data-ts="1750.485" data-end_ts="1750.765" title="1750.485" id=c_"1750.485">__tide__</span> space quite a bit, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1752.435" data-end_ts="1752.725" title="1752.435" id=c_"1752.435">__this__</span> mob delays, I'll have those on <span style="color:red" data-ts="1754.325" data-end_ts="1754.485" title="1754.325" id=c_"1754.325">__an__</span> effects and on the, just externally on the, on the mixer. But if IT typically what ends up happening with my effects in my modular system, is I don't really use them for their intended purpose, which is fairly common. You know, for example, like the, the make noise herb verb, I don't really use that for reverb. I use it for like sheet metal sounds and Right. I just feel like <span style="color:red" data-ts="1776.675" data-end_ts="1776.965" title="1776.675" id=c_"1776.675">__with__</span> that much modulation, I'm not just gonna use it as a, as a reverb, it's just, it does so much more. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. It's interesting you say that in specific because, I remember having a discussion with my friend Gregory, and we were talking about, he was talking about getting an herb verb for his system, and I was like, you know, I like the even <span style="color:red" data-ts="1795.165" data-end_ts="1795.405" title="1795.165" id=c_"1795.165">__tight__</span> space. I don't know that I would use, a reverb embedded like that. And he's like, yeah, but see, I had experience with an old EMS system and the EMS, the, the kind of the tonality you could get out of the, oscillators was a little lame. And so, so often you would use the reverb as an adjunct to the oscillators. And, you know, this is one of the problems of having sort of like this history and recording, it's hard for me to take a reverb and say, oh, a reverb is part of a synthesis chain. Right. I mean, I should know better because I'm patch everything into everything guy. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Except that was one of those cases where I had a mental block that said, Nope, reverbs always are at the end of the chain, and they always add a wash to the whole sound. You know, even though I know better, I, I still, there, there was sort of that mental block that prevented me from going there. Now as a pretty experienced, accomplished musician coming from a different neck of the woods. Have you noticed any mental blocks, things that you either, you know, or maybe because of your experiences with the Voyager, or maybe like to try and never be like the Voyager? Do you catch yourself doing things that are, are kind of either habitual or based off <span style="color:red" data-ts="1876.925" data-end_ts="1877.125" title="1876.925" id=c_"1876.925">__of__</span> behavior like that where you can't, you can't get over something you learned 10 years ago? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bana: </b>Definitely. Definitely. And I feel that that's part of the, the many years of deep conditioning, you know, and mental brainwashing in, in functional harmony <span style="color:red" data-ts="1891.625" data-end_ts="1891.845" title="1891.625" id=c_"1891.625">__and__</span> music theory and Mm-hmm. <affirmative> and tuning and just, you know, two, two decades of that. Like you, the, the modular has really shown me how conditioned my, my, my brain is because I look at other people who go into modular without a musical background. Right. And how they're able to come up with synthesis chains and sounds that I feel like, wow, I could never do that because I'm so, I'm so bogged down with like, tuning things. And I would, you know, not, I, I wouldn't think of maybe playing these two notes together, or, because I've, I've been so deeply conditioned and I'm trying to decondition myself by way of the modular and try and trying to, to, to break sound back down to its building blocks and then re and rebuild it, in a different way, which, which is difficult. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bana: </b>I feel like I have a lot of, a lot of habits, mainly tuning habits that I can't seem to shake off. Right. As much as I would love to. But that's definitely a work in progress. And, definitely I feel like you start to build patch habits almost like muscle memory on an, on an instrument. Like with my bass, if I, if I pick up a bass, I definitely have certain lines or licks that I would play and just, you know, muscle memory from playing for years. And I feel like with a, with a modular, it's, it's easy to develop patch habits, just kind of certain patches that you always find yourself going to. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, so what do you do to combat it? I mean, what are the things, do you ever do catch yourself doing things like saying, wow, because my rig is set up like this, I always make a mug sound, so I'm gonna actually take the easiest to use modules out just so that I don't do that again. Do you go that far <span style="color:red" data-ts="2001.825" data-end_ts="2002.045" title="2001.825" id=c_"2001.825">__as__</span> to change your system, to prevent yourself from habitual behavior? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bana: </b>Definitely. I do rearrange my system almost monthly, if not more. I take out all the modules and I kind of reorganize them and I reconfigure them. And I, yeah. I've definitely had several months where I take out all my sequencers <laugh> and try and figure out other ways to make melodies. And, and also, I mean, I'm, I feel very fortunate to be in LA where there are so many amazing, amazing synth players. Just such a, such a great network of people and people who are just very talented and, and very generous with their time and, and their information. And, so we, we get together a lot and we exchange ideas. That has definitely helped me, get out of certain patch habits and, and I've learned so much from other people in LA that are phenomenal players. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That sounds very familiar. The story of tearing down and rebuilding. I have to admit that I'm sort of a rack rash king, because even though I use Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, use the nylon 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bana: </b>Washers 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Washers, it's still, it still gets to be a mess after a while. I can't help it. I just, that that seems to be a part of making the instrument really personal. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bana: </b>Yeah. And I think it's so funny that people even care about things like rack rash. That's, that's the ridiculous aspect of this <span style="color:red" data-ts="2086.035" data-end_ts="2086.325" title="2086.035" id=c_"2086.035">__some__</span> world. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2086.705" data-end_ts="2086.925" title="2086.705" id=c_"2086.705">__So__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sort of the consumerist aspect of it. Right. For sure. It's almost like, yeah, my, my Willie May's baseball card is in better condition than yours, so I'm a better person somehow. Right. So let, what is, what does the future look like for you? So you, you claim to be just learning, although having seen and heard some of your work, it's got a lot of, maturity in it already. Where are you gonna be taking this? Where are you gonna go? Are you gonna expand into more, extensive and like more complex recording? Are you gonna focus more on performance? Are you gonna just, disappear and build a 5,000, space rack system? <laugh>, <laugh>? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bana: </b>Where are you gonna <span style="color:red" data-ts="2130.605" data-end_ts="2130.725" title="2130.605" id=c_"2130.605">__go__</span>? Definitely not the third option, definitely not the third option. Yeah. I think now I'm focusing more on, I've been playing live quite a bit because that's, that's where I come from and, and I feel that that's going to motivate me to get better and just to really hone my craft. And, and it's, it's different when you play live versus obviously playing alone at home, especially with these instruments. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know, when you're forced to kind of come up with a performance that you hope is going to touch people or whatever, you have to just be a little more intentional about your patching and not just kind of make sounds here and there. And like, you have to kind of think of a, of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2168.845" data-end_ts="2168.965" title="2168.845" id=c_"2168.845">__a__</span>, of a performance and the arc of that. So I definitely have, been saying yes to a lot of live gigs, even though it still terrifies me to play live with this instrument, Uhhuh <affirmative>. And I've been recording quite a bit. So I, I do have a solo record that is coming out in March, which I'm very excited about, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2187.305" data-end_ts="2187.525" title="2187.305" id=c_"2187.305">__be__</span> my first solo record. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>On what label? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bana: </b>It's a label out of Turkey called Vent, VENT. Okay, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bana: </b>So, it's going to be, released on vinyl <span style="color:red" data-ts="2198.065" data-end_ts="2198.285" title="2198.065" id=c_"2198.065">__to__</span> two tracks <span style="color:red" data-ts="2199.135" data-end_ts="2199.485" title="2199.135" id=c_"2199.135">__aside__</span>. So that's, that's very exciting. Yeah. I'm just gonna continue to record and play live and just, keep, keep studying this, this instrument and see where it goes. I mean, I'm still very, very early on in this journey. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. As part of this journey or as part of the direction you're gonna go, do you see yourself drawn into anything that's not modular? Like, for example, can you imagine yourself getting into like an electron octa <span style="color:red" data-ts="2229.085" data-end_ts="2229.325" title="2229.085" id=c_"2229.085">__track__</span> to do something different for live performance or, you know, like the, or some kind of hardware sequencing system or something like that? Do you, do you feel like there's, there's a place for non modular stuff, or do you really see the modular as being the, the focus point for your work? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bana: </b>I definitely would like to incorporate more, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2254.865" data-end_ts="2255.085" title="2254.865" id=c_"2254.865">__the__</span> different kinds of hardware and maybe, you know, start learning Max and things like that just so I can compose songs and, and play live longer, you know? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> with a, with a 12 U case, I find it, I find it hard to squeeze out a performance that's interesting and longer than 20 minutes because you can't just flip a switch and switch the sounds. Right, right. So, and I feel like with performance sometimes it's, it's nice to be able to play 40 minutes to, to an hour and a half and, and really kind of get into it, you know, I mean, Richard Devine obviously can do it with like a, he could, he could do a two hour performance on a skiff and blow your mind <laugh>. I'm not there <laugh>, but, I definitely do see, incorporating that, in the future. I just have to allocate, I just have to, you know, manage my time better and make, make time to learn it, learn, learn another hardware sequencer. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2314.305" data-end_ts="2314.525" title="2314.305" id=c_"2314.305">__Ben__</span>, I wanna thank you so much for your time. This has been a really fun chat. We breezed through that so easily. That was, that was great. And it was also really interesting to hear how you kind of weave your musical background with your desire to learn. And that desire to learn is just kind of a, kind of a winner to me anyway. That's always kind of a good sign of somebody I'm gonna have a great interview with, right. When the desire to learn is part of the discussion. So thanks so much for your time. I really appreciate you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bana: </b>Thank you for your generous time. It's, it's, it's a real honor to be on your podcast. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, <laugh>. Okay. Thanks. I appreciate that. And it's been a, it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2355.685" data-end_ts="2355.805" title="2355.685" id=c_"2355.685">__a__</span>, believe me, it's an honor to have you on there as well. So with that, then I'll let you go on with your day. Thank you so much, and have a good one.

Thank you so much for listening. Thank you for, all of your help in keeping this podcast going. Remember that the podcast goes nowhere without your subscriptions on iTunes, your passing along. Friends, if here's something you like, let somebody know who might care. I really appreciate all the great listenership. I want to keep it growing and keep it going. So I want to thank you so much for that. And with that, I'm gonna sign off for this week. We'll catch you next time. Bye.
