<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. This week I have the pleasure to introduce you to someone that I've been working with a lot lately. His name's August Black and he is, a software developer at Cycling 74. He, focused on doing work with the web, but earlier this year, he kind of put out a call for some help with a project that, I found really intriguing, which was a project that, was a web audio <span style="color:red" data-ts="36.615" data-end_ts="36.965" title="36.615" id=c_"36.615">__based__</span> project where people were sort of like collaborating on making a sound collage. It was really pretty interesting, and it was fun to kinda sit back and just hear people's little snippets of sound come and go. And doing that reminded me that the first time we had met, he had mentioned something about having done some other stuff with radio type things, and given how long I've been doing these podcasts now and stuff like that, I started feeling like, you know, there is some really interesting, there's some interesting information in the whole transference and sharing on the web that we've not really talked much about in the podcast. So I reached out to August, he said he would try and, and grind through, an interview with me. And, with that I will introduce you to August Black Hey, August. How are you doing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>August Black: </b>I'm doing all right. How are you? All right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thanks a lot for doing this. I know it's not probably your favorite task of the day even, but, I appreciate you taking out, taking the time to, to kind of talk to us. So why don't we start off by having you tell us, a little bit about the projects that, that you work on, the kind of, the kind of artwork that you do? 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>I think primarily, I'm a visual artist that works with software and radio and transmission technologies. In the past, I have worked with a bunch of, say, radio and transmission artists on various projects. I think more recently I've been developing software as conceptual art or for the use in conceptual art projects. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So in that case then, do you consider kind of the code to be the artwork, or are you doing something that has some presentation layer to it 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>In some cases? I mean, it's, it's hard to really place where the art is nowadays. Yeah, good point. Oftentimes it's not where you think it is <laugh> <laugh> and in fact, you know, the more interesting art is like that where you, you know, you're kind of reading the plurality of meetings. Right. And oftentimes, you know, all that's happening outside of gallery spaces in the normal places where, you know, you have this, baggage of art history. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, it's interesting you mentioned that because I <span style="color:red" data-ts="188.805" data-end_ts="188.925" title="188.805" id=c_"188.805">__wa__</span> one of the things I was going to ask you about is, is how do you transfer this kind of work, you know, particularly transmission type work. How does that translate into a world that really preferences work that can be shown at a gallery? 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>I think most cases it doesn't unless you have, I guess, somewhat sophisticated, I don't wanna say audience, but if you have, you know, if you have someone who's willing to look at a certain activity as art that's, let's say a little bit atypical or prototypical, then it's a little bit easier to digest and swallow. But I mean, one of the cool things about transmission and radio art is that you aren't talking to an art audience. You know, you're talking to truck drivers and people on their way to school or running around errands or, you know, listening to the radio while they're making dinner. It has a nice horizontal, I guess, play space where you can, I guess, insert artistic activity without even people knowing it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I, I think for people that aren't really keyed into what we're talking about yet, why don't you give us sort of like an example of what this kind of art would look like? 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>Alright, why don't I, why don't I just, tell you about an experience I had in 1996. Perfect. When, I was kind of introduced to this idea of radio art, by a group in Vienna called <span style="color:red" data-ts="273.665" data-end_ts="273.885" title="273.665" id=c_"273.665">__Rio__</span>. And, <span style="color:red" data-ts="278.025" data-end_ts="278.245" title="278.025" id=c_"278.025">__the__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="278.825" data-end_ts="279.045" title="278.825" id=c_"278.825">__Rio__</span> was a weekly broadcast on the National Radio of Austria. It was, I think it's already 20 or 30 years old. And I went there as an intern to work to work with them and ended up sticking around and helping them produce. And, and, and when I say that, I mean, I was on the production team making webpages and, you know, organization doing organizational stuff. Okay. Helped them produce this project called Rivers and Bridges, which was like the, the sequel to another project they did the year before called Horizontal Radio. And the idea was they got together a bunch of broadcasters from the European, broadcasting Association and, organized satellites and organize real audio streams on the worldwide web to interconnect artists in various places as one event. 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>Okay. And the idea, the idea was to, to create a kind of network sculpture, where you could have migratory audio patterns, perhaps someone's looping something in Vienna that was formerly in Budapest. And of course you're dealing with all the political issues back then. There wasn't even the, you know, there was some shame territory going on, but it wasn't really European Union yet. So the whole idea of crossing borders and the political context was also another, I guess, component of this, of this, event. So that's, that was kinda like my introduction. I was 19 years old and I was there as an intern, ended up sticking around and making my own radio shows. I had a weekly radio show in, lints called Fundamental Radio. I did that with my partner Marcus <span style="color:red" data-ts="377.065" data-end_ts="377.485" title="377.065" id=c_"377.065">__Seidel__</span>. What we tried to do was, go into the radio station, every Thursday night and, within 15 or 20 minutes try to do something on Air Live that was so new and something that you wouldn't typically hear on radio. And I think by that I mean not playing music and not talking about the music you're playing. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b><laugh>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="404.515" data-end_ts="404.865" title="404.515" id=c_"404.515">__Right__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>And if you think of, you know, making radio <span style="color:red" data-ts="407.525" data-end_ts="407.745" title="407.525" id=c_"407.525">__and__</span> that under those kind of constraints, it, it kind of opens up a world of opportunities. Sure. So we ended up doing a lot of things we would like, we would record things that, that were an hour long, like my washing machine and play that on air. Which was actually one of our most popular shows. A lot of people called in to guess what kind of machine it was. <laugh>. We had another whole month we dedicated to silence where we would just turn the mics on and not say anything, which is like the number one thing you're not supposed to do on the radio. Right. And, you know, people would call in like after five or 10 minutes, oh man, the station's not <span style="color:red" data-ts="442.865" data-end_ts="443.105" title="442.865" id=c_"442.865">__broke__</span>, the station's broken. I was like, no, it's not broken. We're just playing silence <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>And we'd do that all in the air and you know, sure enough, two or three people would call in. Right. Another thing we'd do, we did another month of feedback, just, you know, finding all kinds of feedback to, to play into the transmitter and then take out of the transfer <span style="color:red" data-ts="460.665" data-end_ts="460.825" title="460.665" id=c_"460.665">__and__</span> feedback in. Right. Another, another like major thing you're not supposed to do in the radio studio. Right. And so we, we messed around with <span style="color:red" data-ts="468.425" data-end_ts="468.665" title="468.425" id=c_"468.425">__John__</span>, or we messed around with like, the technology of radio, and then we got almost immediately interested in taking our show to other places. So we were setting up MP three streams, which at the time in like 1998 was pretty brand new. We had, we even wrote our own MP three streamer to do it. And we would go set up in people's kitchens, make pasta with them, mic the pasta, mic the conversation, and that would be our show. 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>Right. We, we, were able to take this on the road a few places. Like we, did a live show on the rooftop of, the University of Lapland in Romy Finland. We did a show out on the Lights Plan in Amsterdam. We did a show in Tasmania <span style="color:red" data-ts="512.105" data-end_ts="512.145" title="512.105" id=c_"512.105">__and__</span> Hobar Hobart at the museum there. So we were always game to like find context to put this show in and then make the show around the space that we were in. Okay. Sure. Somehow, like on the Lights plane we gave, we decided we would give out a beer for 30 seconds of content <laugh>. So we got a bunch of people, you know, drug people in the street, screaming into the mic, singing, telling their political views, et cetera, et cetera. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, this is really interesting because it seems kind of one of the big movements in, in art at the moment. And, <span style="color:red" data-ts="546.185" data-end_ts="546.405" title="546.185" id=c_"546.185">__and__</span> this kind of comes and goes, but sort of like, the art of place, you know, location driven artwork and stuff. And it seems to me like that's exactly what this was. You would, you would drop yourself into a place and find some way to activate the people around you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>Yeah, for sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>One of the things I like doing in the podcast is I like talking to people about their background and the fact that you were sort of that, that you were sort of interested enough to go and, intern at this raio place when you were 19, tells me that you must have had a pretty interesting background to kind of have your head, you know, when I was 19, I was barely putting away my KISS albums. Right. <laugh> <laugh>. So I'm kind of curious to know where, where you came from, you know, what was your background that kind of had your head open to such stuff? 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>God, I don't even know. Oh man. I was, I mean, I was a university student. I was studying, I was studying art at, Syracuse University and my background, like in high school and stuff, I was just, I was into drawing and painting. I just drew and painted all day every day, more or less. Okay. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, when I went to art school, I kind of put all that down and started making videos and, performances. And I had an interesting professor. His name was Tom Sherman, who was also an artist. He had connections all over 'cause he was head of the Canadian Council at one point. And, he brought in Heidi Grundman from the <span style="color:red" data-ts="645.765" data-end_ts="645.885" title="645.765" id=c_"645.765">__K__</span> radio to give a talk one year. And, I just, I just found it completely fascinating. It wasn't, anything I had known about or heard about, and they had this internship at my university to do, an internship abroad. 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>It just had to be somewhat creative and something you couldn't do normally. Right. So I wrote to Heidi, I was like, Hey, how would you like to have, you know, an artist come help you out in the show? Alls I need is like a, a sponsor there and I'll work out the rest and I'll get paid from this, this grant. And I put it together and, and like, only 30 people applied for this grant, and they gave out six of them. So I had, <span style="color:red" data-ts="683.805" data-end_ts="683.885" title="683.805" id=c_"683.805">__I__</span> had a good chance of winning. Right. And I, I got one and I went over there and, of course these were like, you know, really sophisticated artists. I, I showed up with like paint all over my slacks and like half <span style="color:red" data-ts="696.165" data-end_ts="696.445" title="696.165" id=c_"696.165">__beat__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="696.465" data-end_ts="696.685" title="696.465" id=c_"696.465">__up__</span>, you know, white, white person dreadlocks. And, and they asked me what I could do and I said I could draw pretty pictures. They said, all right, well why don't you sit down in front of this computer? They had a Macintosh 8,600 and ASGI indie. And I said, see what you can do with graphics and maybe learn how to make websites. And so that's what I did. Ended up making the whole, well, I ended up making a good part of the Rivers and Bridge Rivers and Bridges projects website and interacting with a bunch of artists who were involved in that project. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. So sounds to me like you, prior to doing that, you didn't really have that much of a technical background at all. 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>Oh, zero. Really. Zero. I, I, I mean, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So how did you go from a guy who draws, who draws pretty pictures into a guy who develops his own MP three streamer? What's that look like? 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>Wow. That, like, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Hanging around other people that code a lot or 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>Kind of Yeah. I mean, at that point I was really into the stuff and I dunno, I kind of come from a long line of radical do it yourselfers. My grandfather was a cowboy from Oklahoma. He could weld, he could do everything, fix cars. My dad's kind of like that too. And I'm, I I just got in my mind that if I want something to happen, I I got, sometimes I gotta do it myself. And we were really interested in building this streaming technology, which is like a radio application all in itself. You know, you can mix channels of your files on disk and combine them and stream 'em out to, you know, ACA server or whatnot. I started working on that in 1998, not really knowing how to program, but, I was hanging out with another guy named Yara Mill, who was a hacker from Italy. We started hacking this app together. He would do kind of the, the hardcore C stuff. And I was, building the, the front end initially in, in tickle tk. Oh 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Wow. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>So I kind of migrated from websites to tickle tk. And then, we did that for two years and I learned a bunch of c plus plus writing the rewriting the interface in FLTK. I don't know if you've ever heard of these gooey things. They're kind of like 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Software. Yeah. Real old, old style stuff. Old, 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>Yeah. Old. Yeah. Totally. And then just got, got more and more into it. Eventually I was writing my own streaming applications in c and c plus plus I worked a lot with video and OpenGL and, you know, I just, I got into it and somehow left the art world and, and got more into like the artisanal world of, of, you know, digital craft and, and code making. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, <span style="color:red" data-ts="853.545" data-end_ts="853.765" title="853.545" id=c_"853.545">__and__</span>, and it's interesting you put it that way because you are actually kind of at the root base of a number of other people, some of whom I've interviewed. So, like, I interviewed Wesley Smith and he points to you as being one of the troublemakers that got him into coding. 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>Yeah. Wess and I, we, we, became roommates in Santa Barbara, and I remember he was like, he was doing all kinds of crazy geometry and graphic stuff in Max and wanted to make his own CC external for it. Right. And, I helped him on pointers and how to get through all that. And then, then man, that guy took off like within a week. He was like, he went well above anything I could do and see <laugh> <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, you know, he, he just, he's one of those people that math is something at the cellular level to him, you know? Yeah. He seems to just have an understanding of it that he can't even always articulate, but it just seems like there's a lot of clarity there for him. 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>Totally. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, but you know, that's him <span style="color:red" data-ts="916.925" data-end_ts="917.085" title="916.925" id=c_"916.925">__in__</span> math. It sounds to me like actually you <span style="color:red" data-ts="919.545" data-end_ts="919.765" title="919.545" id=c_"919.545">__and__</span> code kind of <span style="color:red" data-ts="920.935" data-end_ts="921.285" title="920.935" id=c_"920.935">__owned__</span> the same relationship because again, I, when he talked about, when he talked about your influence, it was sort of like you showed him how to approach coding in a way that that was very comfortable to him. And I know just for myself, working with you on some web projects right now, you have, you have a really interesting way of talking about code. It's almost as if there's like some sort of like built <span style="color:red" data-ts="950.145" data-end_ts="950.365" title="950.145" id=c_"950.145">__in__</span> justice to the way that coding and, and operating systems work and stuff. And so there is kind of a right way of doing things from your perspective <laugh>, which just makes it seem to me like you have some sort of internal comfort level with digital systems that an awful lot of artists don't have. 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>Yeah. I think if you ask, you know, 10 different programmers, what the right way of doing things, you'll get 10 different answers. <laugh>. But that's the interesting, if you ask 10 different writers how to, how to describe, how to <span style="color:red" data-ts="981.405" data-end_ts="981.605" title="981.405" id=c_"981.405">__try__</span> tie your shoe laces, you're gonna get 10 different answers too. Right. And I, I think of coding that way as well. You know, there's like the proficiency and literacy phase where you can actually write, write code that compiles and does something Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And then from there you have all different styles and tangents. And not all writers the same and not all coders are the same. Sure. And we, we often think of coding as, I don't know if it's a trade or as, as like in black and white, you just, you, you make that work and it works. But actually coding is more like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1016.585" data-end_ts="1016.805" title="1016.585" id=c_"1016.585">__or__</span> writing software I think is more like some more like a craft or, for lack of a better word, it's more like an art. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's funny because you talked about sort of like taking on the artisanal aspects of coding, and I think you're right about that because I mean, if nothing else, you get a sense of it when you look at people's code, you can kind of get a sense of how their brain operates, how they think their way through problems. A lot of that is sort of built into the way that the code is constructed as well as like how much do they interact with, with tools made by others, or, you know, are they really insular and write everything themselves? Those kind of things all kind of get embedded in the code. Oh, for sure. In a very kind of very human way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>Oh, definitely. And like, I mean, it has, I mean, it's, it's immaterial software, right. You can't touch it. Right. But it, it does have form. Yeah. PE people often forget that. It's kinda like, it's kinda like, you know, looking at a city and, and just noticing, you know, the, the streets, how it constructs and, and forms the city itself. Right. And the streets I think is a good example because they often are so invisible to us having grown up with automobiles and whatnot. It, it defines where you travel and how you, how you navigate through space. I think code has formal aspects along those lines. And of course the analogy isn't one-to-one, but, well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>No, but it has, where I find that that actually speaks to me. I mean, like you, I come from a lineage of do it yourselfers, but do it yourselfer or like, I tend to think of them almost as hackers, but they weren't hackers in the coating standpoint. They were hacking with an arc welder or they were hacking with, you know, a, a sawzall or something. Totally mean. They, they had the ability, my grandfather, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1131.625" data-end_ts="1131.845" title="1131.625" id=c_"1131.625">__the__</span> people would come to his barn from counties away because he could fix their graders or bulldozers or something in a way that nobody else could. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And my father likewise, you know, kind of got into it, but instead of bulldozers and stuff, he was maybe into some other stuff. But I always felt like I didn't hold up that end of the tradition because, you know, I barely know which end of an arc welder to hold. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And so, which is pretty dangerous actually when it comes down to arc welders. Yeah. But, the fact is, when you put it like that about, about code having form and having sort of a, a level of construction that is similar to physical objects, that that maybe makes it seem a little bit more like I'm upholding my end of my <laugh>, you know, my end of that lineage. 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>Yeah. I mean that's, that's what I was trying to get at when I said we, you know, we were, I immediately started writing my own MP three streamer. Right. Just because it didn't exist and I wanted to have it, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure, sure. That makes a lot of sense. So what, what was your education process then in terms of doing it? Was it just taking advantage of the nascent, internet and digging up information that way? Or did you take any formal training? How did you, how did you get the technical skills necessary to do it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>I bought a book called Sam's Teach Yourself C Plus Plus in 21 Days, <laugh>. And, it took me probably more, you know, 21 months <laugh>. But, I worked together, I just started doing it and, I was lucky I was living with this guy and we were just, we were just, programming. We got into this project. We got a tiny, tiny bit of funding for it, Uhhuh <affirmative>, I think only like 2000 euros, in two, and that was in 2000. We'd already been working on it for a while. And we just started doing this in our free time. And he was a somewhat decent seed programmer, probably more of a system administrator and hacker. Any questions I had, I could go to him almost immediately. That was probably my, training there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see. 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>And it's mostly trial and error and RTFM. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. But still having at least someone to bounce ideas off of. 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Once, once you kind of got this technical, these technical bones together, then what did, what were some of the early projects? What did they look like? Because you talk about transmission technology and this idea of interacting with the radio, but also programming. And how does all of this stuff mesh together? What are, what were like the early projects looking like? 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>Well, this one thing was the Muse, multi-user streamer that we built. The other one is the, in 2000 I started working for the free radio stations in Austria. I built the cultural broadcasting archive, which is just a, a simple PHP MySQL database, but for all the free radios in Austria to archive their broadcasts. And that's still running. I, I worked with a bunch of artists. We were doing God various projects. I worked with this guy named Rupert Hoer. We built this installation called yyc. And I programmed this whole interface in JavaScript where you could move, stones <span style="color:red" data-ts="1329.625" data-end_ts="1329.845" title="1329.625" id=c_"1329.625">__on__</span>, like, images of stones on screen, and they would be sounds hidden underneath that. And these were all kind of like, they would send network triggers to different places where the audio would be hurting the installation. I see. Sure. But really, I, I, it's hard to, like, it's hard to like put any kind of like description on what this stuff was because it was all over the place. Sure. I worked with people on like, like commercial projects, on artistic projects and, and a lot of times, like the commercial projects would be creative technology projects where it was, you know, the technology was interesting to me. We were building something new. Right. I worked for two years at the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1366.285" data-end_ts="1366.365" title="1366.285" id=c_"1366.285">__RS__</span> Electronic <span style="color:red" data-ts="1366.805" data-end_ts="1366.965" title="1366.805" id=c_"1366.805">__at__</span> Future Lab, and we did, I did all kinds of projects there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So it sounds like a pretty shotgun approach to just trying a lot of stuff, right? <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So I want <span style="color:red" data-ts="1377.325" data-end_ts="1377.405" title="1377.325" id=c_"1377.325">__to__</span> talk, I'm, I'm still trying to probe a little bit on this idea of transmission technology and how does that differ from sort of like right now it's kind of cool to say, oh, I'm working on web audio, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, how does this differ from typical web audio stuff? I mean, do you focus on always having sort of like a real world presence to this stuff? Like either through a broadcast system of some sort, or is it cool to just have web audio stuff? 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>Yeah, I mean, I think for me the audio is somewhat secondary. If, you know, I might even completely disregard it. To tell you the truth. I'm more interested in creating the space, like with this, residency I had at <span style="color:red" data-ts="1419.725" data-end_ts="1419.885" title="1419.725" id=c_"1419.725">__Wave__</span> Farm. So what the, the whole, the whole, let me just explain. What I set up was a little interface that connected people online and the audio input from your, your speaker at your location would be given two seconds on the air in sequence. So it just went round robin from one participant to the other, and you got like a little green flashing circle on your, your web browser when it was your turn to make noise or whatnot. You know, at some point some people started counting. There was tons of feedback just naturally, but also self-induced people taking like the, the output of their speakers and putting it back into the microphone. 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>Right. We had a bunch of like noise makers, but, there was a bunch of kids actually on there. Some parents put it on, just let their kids have fun with it. <laugh>. Yeah. So it changed quite a bit over time. It was, it was pretty noisy all throughout. Right. But I dunno, some part of me likes to think it was, it was partially listenable. I was really interested in creating the space for art to happen or creating the space for the audio to come in. I didn't create the audio. I just created a little like network interface for the audio to travel through. I see. Right. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, and I mean, I used the web audio API, to get the input, maybe set the gain, make sure the gains are somewhat similar between the different participants in this, you know, network event. But the interesting thing for me is like turning it on. And I mean, it really, that's the interesting thing about the transmission in, in general, it's not, it's the space that happens when the machines are on Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Right, right. I don't know how to describe it, but that that'll impulse you get <span style="color:red" data-ts="1519.845" data-end_ts="1520.005" title="1519.845" id=c_"1519.845">__or__</span> the lec you know, the electronic impulse you get from participating in this live thing where things are happening simultaneously. It's interesting. It's like, it's like watching the, the Super Bowl. Right. You can't watch it the day after. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. It doesn't even make sense. 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>It doesn't make sense. Right. It's that it's that moment that counts everybody watching at the same time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Now, now I'm getting a, a better sense of sort of like your internal interest in doing this. And, and it's kind of interesting that you pointed out this way, but also because, I mean, the way it was set up is that it kind of round robin would drop in and then, you know, it would like capture some noise that you made, you know, apparently <span style="color:red" data-ts="1558.345" data-end_ts="1558.565" title="1558.345" id=c_"1558.345">__and__</span> stashing it somewhere. And it was, it was a really interesting and sort of deep sensation to just sort of like experience what people given, given a five second platform or 10 seconds or whatever it was. Given this two, two what, 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>Two seconds, seconds per person. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Two seconds. Okay. <laugh>, well, given two seconds. What a two second platform. What is it people that people were incited to do now? I mean, on one hand it's like, well boy, I can't wait to get my two seconds. But for me, I found that it was a whole lot. I just ended up setting up a drum machine so that when it comes around to me, hopefully it would catch a drum beat or two. Right. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> I was just fascinated though, by just listening to people. Some people just had a, a desire to scream, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. And, and other people would try and like construct. It was as if I have a whole lot to say and I only got two seconds to say it. Right. Yeah. It was really an amazing experience. And it was one of those things where you got this sense of that place being exciting because it was different. It put people in sort of a different environment and maybe in a not completely comfortable one. Yeah. And as a result, they, they couldn't depend on sort of like their stock reaction to carrying on a conversation or drawing attention to themselves or whatever. They had to do something else. And it was really interesting to see how different people reacted to that. I actually think that having that really, I'm, I'm surprised it was two seconds because actually when it would come around, it seemed like that light was on for a long time. <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>Uhhuh. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. You know, but maybe because I was more interested in listening than performing. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1669.705" data-end_ts="1669.925" title="1669.705" id=c_"1669.705">__Mm__</span>. You know, the light coming on wasn't necessarily desirable to me. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1674.865" data-end_ts="1675.085" title="1674.865" id=c_"1674.865">__Mm__</span>. But nevertheless, it was a really curious thing. It was, it was interesting to see how different people reacted to that kind of stage. 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>Yeah. I mean, I was really unsure how people would, take to it. When we first started out, we had like a backup plan of just doing like interviews and whatever. We didn't really think so many people would join in. Right. But we, we ended up doing it for two hours and it changed a lot in that whole time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Did it, you know, as things would kind of flicker, you know, through your, through your speakers, you got a sense of who was the, who were the people on the other side of the line. 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>Totally. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Which is pretty wild given if you think about the limitations of a microphone through a web browser for two seconds. 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The fact that that could transmit any information at all is, is actually pretty surprising. So now you told me, in addition to like the coding work and stuff, you, you did, you actually, you've actually done sort of radio programs over, over the years, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I mean, is this, besides the stuff that you did in Europe, or was that pretty much it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>No, that was pretty much it. I left Europe in 2004 officially. I mean, I've been back a bunch and, and I've stayed there. I lived mostly in Vienna. I see. But I, I went and I, I did grad school in Santa Barbara, and at that point I wasn't really doing radio anymore. I tried to keep it up for a while because we had this whole remote setup right. Where, I could, I could flip a, a switch and open up a live stream directly to the, the transmitter in Lins. But the, the time difference between Lins and Santa Barbara was just too big to really consider it. We did it for a couple shows and that was, that was it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. What <span style="color:red" data-ts="1785.205" data-end_ts="1785.285" title="1785.205" id=c_"1785.205">__did__</span> you end up with? Like the 4:00 AM block or something like 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>That? Oh God, I, yeah. What is it? It was 8:00 PM there, so it was just during the day here, Uhhuh. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see. 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>Which, you know, conflicted with a bunch of different things. Things. Oh yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Absolutely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>Yeah. And I think I had enough that was grueling too. You know, doing <span style="color:red" data-ts="1801.845" data-end_ts="1801.965" title="1801.845" id=c_"1801.845">__a__</span>, doing something creative once a week, every week for five years is, you know, it's, it's, it gets exhausting. You run outta ideas, you start to repeat yourself. It's not as exciting as it was when you first started. Takes a lot of dedication to keep that going. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The fact of the matter is you've done a lot of things over a longer period of time. When you run into those kind of blocks, when you run into the kind of thing of like, man, I can't even think of something creative to do. What are the mechanisms that you do to sort of like jumpstart yourself? 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>Oh, I usually take a walk <laugh>. Yeah. Unless I'm under pressure, then I, we just have like, try to have a few go-to things to do. We always had like backup, like we would go to archive.org and get a bunch of audio stuff and try to mash 'em together. And then my partner and I, we would just chitchat, make up all kinds of shit on the radio. Right. In fact, that's how we started. We just, we went into the, we were invited for this Raio broadcast, to do something. We invented up, we invented this topic called All That Space and nowhere to go and just started talking and performing all around that, that idea, you know, where would you go on the internet <laugh>. Right, right. When you can't go anywhere. So I don't, I guess to answer your question, I don't really have a go-to 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, except it sounds like, it sounds like actually, some of your, some of your partnerships or some of the, the people that you've worked with over the years have ended up being pretty influential. 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>Oh, totally. Absolutely. In fact, doing the radio was mostly a collaborative thing anyway. I always did it with somebody else. It's hard to be in multiple places by yourself. And so we, you know, it was easier to, to it, it, it lent itself better to having more than one person 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Involved. Right, right. Do you ever miss it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>Kind of, but I'm onto other things now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Like what? I mean, it's, you're onto other things except you kind of came back with this wave farm, project to sort of at least bring some echoes of what you were doing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>Yeah. But I think that's, that's what I mean. I'm more into the, the building of the software, building 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Of the space 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1936.185" data-end_ts="1936.405" title="1936.185" id=c_"1936.185">__Now__</span>. Yeah. Building of the space, building of the software than actually performing in it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. Well, yeah, and you know, to a certain extent that is kind of a form of modern performance art. The, it used to be the performance art always sort of demanded the artist to be present at the performance, but there's a lot of things you can do with, with coding that sort of set the plates without necessarily requiring your appearance. 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>For sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>For sure. And that's, that's kind of an interesting, an interesting twist on it. What do you have planned for the future? Do you have anything in mind right now? Or are you kind of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1973.785" data-end_ts="1974.005" title="1973.785" id=c_"1973.785">__in__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1974.005" data-end_ts="1974.125" title="1974.005" id=c_"1974.005">__a__</span>, in a midpoint? 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>I'm kind of in a midpoint. I guess. I mean, I would love to expand on this, wayfare re resident residency project. I'd like to put some knobs on the, the time window that the users have and maybe get hundreds of users involved and, turn into a sort of granular synthesis process where I can turn it, you know, from a two second window up to 10 seconds or down to like 10 milliseconds. Right. I think that's the only real idea I have along those lines right now. Other than that, I'm like, I'm working all my house, I'm taking care of my kids, <laugh>, you know. Yeah. Well you're, I have a garden in my back that, you know, I'm, I'm growing my vegetables. There you go. Or trying to at least. And, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, one of the other ways that you and I are alike is, is having a batch of kids 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>How do you find, I mean, for me, my kids are getting a little older now. My youngest is nine. And so I feel like it's, it's sort of like opening the door for more opportunity to get out and collaborate with other people and do more of my work than, than I had been able to for a while. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. How do you find the, the effect of kids in your life in, in terms of how it, it might affect your artwork? 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>Oh, it just, it takes all the, the time away from being, takes 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>All the juice, huh? <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>Yeah. I mean, to be being an artist, to be an artist, you really, I mean, to do that full-time, like make a living at it, you gotta be able to, you know, put a lot of time into it. Right. There's just too many artists out in the world to, to just, do it in your spare time. Right. Doing that takes dedication, not just to be, you know, poor or whatnot and to live that kind of aesthetic lifestyle until maybe you get a break or whatever, but you gotta have the wherewithal to do it as a job, you know? Right, right. Doing something that you thought was fun or whatever because you were passionate about it as a job, then, you know, when it becomes a job, it's no longer fun anymore, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>No one tells you that. Right. They say you follow your passion or whatever, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2107.685" data-end_ts="2107.885" title="2107.685" id=c_"2107.685">__when__</span>, when your passion becomes your job. It, it kind of sucks 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>You know, that. And like, I got a love-hate relationship with the art world anyway, you know, this whole relational aesthetics thing, what people actually value as art kind of passes my ass, quite considerably <laugh>. So, you know, I got, I got all kinds of issues. I gotta deal with Darwin you know, not just my kids. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well that's, I mean, it's, it's kinda interesting that you say that because you downplay both the amount of work that you, you've done and, and what you're doing. And because you've actually done a lot of stuff. I mean, you sent me some links and then I did some more searching and there's this pretty phenomenal amount of work out there that's got your name attached to it. It's pretty, pretty impressive stuff. But I think it's also interesting to talk to somebody who isn't in love with the art world. Yeah. And I think that, especially someone willing to say when art becomes your job, you know, it may have been a fun passion at one point, but then it's a job. Yep. And a job always carries with it this like, kind of emotional baggage. Right. So I wanna thank you for, spending the time. And, one last thing before we go. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I think especially interesting, your answer will be interesting on this. It's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2189.365" data-end_ts="2189.485" title="2189.365" id=c_"2189.365">__a__</span> answer. A lot of interviewers kind of pull out of their hat or ass or someplace. But, that is, if you were to run into a much younger version of yourself, like the, the 17 year old August or whatever, what advice would you give that person? Or would you wave 'em off of something? Or would you say, dude, focus on this. What would you, what would you recommend as a, that that might provide an appropriate course correction? Or would you say run with it? <laugh>, maybe it was perfect. 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>You know, I can't really imagine it being any other way given the person that I am and like the, the circumstances I, and environments I went through. But, I would probably go back just out of interest really, and tell myself, like, tell myself not to look at the screen. You know, just get away from the computer and do something else. Not because I, I don't, you know, like where I'm at, I don't like programming computers. I do, I'm kind of addicted to it, but I, I think I have a propensity to be a different person if I had honed a different skill instead of this one. Right. You know, perhaps becoming a draftsman or artist, you know, making, you know, following that dream. Right. And I would just like to see that, who that person was or who that person would be. Not 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2274.925" data-end_ts="2275.085" title="2274.925" id=c_"2274.925">__Really__</span>, frankly, I, while I'm raising kids, I don't have a garden. I don't have this other stuff because I'm kind of a addicted to looking at the screen as well. And I think it is kind of interesting to think about the paths that might've been taken, if there would've been more focus on getting away from the screen or more, more focus on expanding the repertoire beyond the, the eighth inch jack on the back of the computer. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>Yeah. And I think at my time, I, I mean, that was like a really new, it was a new like territory that opened up in the art world, this whole media art thing. Right. And, I really took to it and I thought, God, there's just no way you can make art anymore with painting 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>Right, right. And you can't, you can't really, I mean, the art's, not the, the painting really. It's all like the, the circumstantial stuff that happens around it. Right. In my opinion. Yeah. But I still love it. I still love drawing, man. I still love, looking at drawings. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Do you keep it up? Do you keep on, do you keep up your drawing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>Not as much. I, I, you know, I have a sketch pad and sometimes my wife and I, we'll sit down and do <span style="color:red" data-ts="2345.285" data-end_ts="2345.445" title="2345.285" id=c_"2345.285">__the__</span> kind of like art therapy and draw, you know, stupid shit like cake monsters and <laugh>. She likes drawing like je <laugh>. 'cause she knows I like je and twin Peaks. So she does like these collages for my birthday, JE and <laugh> on top of, on in, inside of like Twin Peaks, settings, <laugh>, you know, but we do, we do stupid stuff like that. I haven't done a serious drawing in, in a long time, but, you know, every now and then I sit down, I paint a landscape or I have a sketchbook and I draw something and it's just fun. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well that's, that's interesting. And that sounds like a really good therapy actually. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b><laugh>, yeah, probably I should do more of it. Maybe. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, August, I want to thank you, again for the time. It was really great. We blew through that time. Yeah. Quite, quite rapidly. It was great. Where should, for people that are interested in taking a look at your work, where's the best place to see some of it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>Yeah, I kind of hide it. <laugh>, my, my, my website is like my, my personal identity, it's aog.meant.org. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2407.165" data-end_ts="2407.285" title="2407.165" id=c_"2407.165">__A__</span>

</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>Yeah, I'm, I'm kind of, I guess I'm still kind of internet shy. I don't really do much, self advertisement. But yeah, if you go to Wave Farm, you can find, you can search for me there, find out more about my residency. Right. You can also go to fund.min.org to learn more about the radio show <span style="color:red" data-ts="2430.165" data-end_ts="2430.485" title="2430.165" id=c_"2430.165">__ahead__</span> with Marcus Seidel. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright, well thanks. 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>That's a good place to start. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, that sounds like <span style="color:red" data-ts="2438.285" data-end_ts="2438.405" title="2438.285" id=c_"2438.285">__a__</span>, that sounds like some, good net diving there. So <laugh>. Cool. Thanks. Thanks for your time and you have yourself a great day. Okay, 
</p>

<p>
<b>August: </b>You too, Darwin Take it easy, man. Bye. bye-Bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And there you have it. I hope that you enjoyed that chat with August Black A couple of notes. First of all, please do me a favor and go over to our website. That's Art Music tech dot libson, L-I-B-S-Y n.com. There you're going to find the links that August talks about. He does in fact hide his work, so you'll need to use my links to get there, but also to check out our link for a Kickstarter that we're having in order to support the purchase of a field recorder that we'll be able to use for face-to-face interviews. So I hope that you'll take a look at that. The Kickstarter, if you want to just search for it, is called an Updated Recorder for Art plus Music plus Technology. I think that the project number is 8 2 3 3 1 9 5 4 7 if that helps you. But I'd appreciate if you support our purchase of a new recorder so that I can get out of the house and talk to more people. And with that, I, thank you for listening and I'll talk to you next week. Bye.
