<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. So this week we are going to be talking to someone who I consider kind of a friend. I've been working with her, on different projects, both instructional as well as artistic over the last several years. Her name is Jane Rigler and she's an assistant professor down at the University of Colorado in Colorado Springs. She is a flutist, that's how you say that, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane Rigler: </b><laugh>? I mean, yeah, I guess so. You 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Know, I'm, I'm a guitar player, so I'm used to saying, <span style="color:red" data-ts="39.59" data-end_ts="39.81" title="39.59" id=c_"39.59">__oh__</span>, the flute player. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> <span style="color:red" data-ts="42.76" data-end_ts="43.05" title="42.76" id=c_"42.76">__aist__</span>. And somebody who has, extraordinary technical chops. I, I remember the first time I heard her play, she had just gotten a new instrument. We had met, we were meeting to talk about some things with Ableton Live, and she was like, very excited about having a new instrument and pulled it out and, went to play it. And the stream of notes and tones and stuff that came out just shocked me, kind of put me back on my heels. I was not, I don't know what I was expecting, but I wasn't expecting what I heard. And, subsequently I've seen her perform a number of times, and it's been just really eyeopening and exciting to me to hear someone with that much facility on instrument, but also working, kind of in conjunction with technology to do really great stuff. So, with that long-winded introduction, let's say hello to Jane. Hi, Jane. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>Hi. Hi. I'm good. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>All right. Well, thanks a lot for taking a little time out of your day to, talk with me. I appreciate it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>Oh, thank you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I, I know for a fact that you actually listened to my podcast. So when I, kick off with the first question, which is tell me a little something about your background, that probably shouldn't be much of a surprise, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b><laugh>, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So if you could tell me a little bit about your background, and particularly, you know, what things have kind of made you the artist that you are. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="131.83" data-end_ts="132.05" title="131.83" id=c_"131.83">__Mm__</span>, that's a good question. Well, my background is, is classical flute. My background was always, geared toward learning <span style="color:red" data-ts="143.29" data-end_ts="143.49" title="143.29" id=c_"143.29">__to__</span> plane an orchestra and getting a gig in an orchestra. Before that, when I was in, high school, I was a competitor and I competed a lot and was, was really interested in, in how to just be this really versatile, but versatile, athletically inclined, flutist. My brother is a bagpiper and liked to play like, you know, all sorts of instruments, the bass and the guitar. And sometimes he would in insist that I play with him and his group, and they would say, you know, oh, improvise. And I, I don't know how to improvise, but I would just kind of go along with it. And I really felt free and fun whenever I did that. But it was very few and far between. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>But up until I was about, you know, 20, when I graduated from Northwestern University, I was really geared toward being a, an orchestra player. But I was very, very frustrated. I, I felt like chained and I felt that I, I just never really had my own voice. And gradually I ended up at uc, San Diego in the experimental music program there, and I was forced into improvising, and I had always been interested in the voice. And so I started singing and playing. And from that, I ended up playing a lot of contemporary, very complex contemporary music that also got me thinking about music from around the world. So I started really listening to lots of different kinds of music from all over the world, and realized that there were a lot of people who, a lot of people, a lot of cultures who were singing and playing with tubes simultaneously in this research that I was doing with singing and playing and improvising, as well as performing very complex, contemporary new works, I was also interacting with my colleagues who were doing some amazing work with interactive electronics. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>And together with my colleagues, at U C S D at the time, I gradually became very, very interested in working with electronic systems where I was, I wasn't actually doing the electronics, I wasn't programming, but I was working together with my peers to create, pieces where I would improvise and they, and their, their systems would collect my sounds, and we would, we would play these pieces that were completely randomly generated, improvising where the computer would interact with me. And I was fascinated, and I loved it so much. So I, my work from, from about 1991 or 1990 until, you know, now <laugh> has been across between all of these things. I'm classically trained, flutist or flutist, both is correct. Uhhuh. Okay. I, I, I work with, I, I work with premiering new works, acoustically and also playing in ensembles. I, I work with, people who are interested in using interactive electronics where I'm the interpreter and I interact with their, their works. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>And then I also, have now gotten to the point where I'm able <laugh> to have enough skills that I can create my own pieces. I lived in Spain for nine years, and during that time I worked with a composer named Jose Manuel Begue in <span style="color:red" data-ts="361.92" data-end_ts="362.14" title="361.92" id=c_"361.92">__ca__</span> in Barcelona. And he, I would look over his shoulder a lot and, and we worked on really fun, incredible pieces with Maxim s p and it was with him that I, when I, you know, looking over his shoulder and really extensively rehearsing with him, what works, what doesn't work, what can I do, my vocabulary, being expanded through his instrument and vice versa, his instrument, you know, being expanded through what I can do. We really created some, some really fun, fascinating, pieces together. And he also was involved with jitter. So this whole element of the, the, the physicality of playing the, the, the quality of 3D that happened that he could make through, through jitter and, and the images that he could create, as well as just musical vocabulary, that we could expand upon was super exciting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>And so, when I arrived in New York in 2003 and I moved there to live, I applied to Harvest <span style="color:red" data-ts="423.31" data-end_ts="423.66" title="423.31" id=c_"423.31">__Works__</span> where I, I cuz I had a whole idea, a whole vision of what I really wanted to do with Max M S P and what I wanted to do as a performer. And what I wanted to do was storytelling and magic and sound and sounds moving in rooms. And, and that's where I began to develop my device for controlling, sounds, not by touching a computer, but through a small little triggering device that I developed through, lots of help with people at Harvest <span style="color:red" data-ts="452.63" data-end_ts="452.98" title="452.63" id=c_"452.63">__Works__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Oh my goodness. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>Yeah, <laugh>, that's, that was a long introduction, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I know, but it was, it was perfect because I didn't know about three quarters of that, first of all. And, secondly, I just, I just literally tossed out all the questions I was gonna ask because now I have a whole new set of questions I'm dying to ask. So I'm gonna kind of start at the beginning of the notes. I just jotted down, first of all, you went to Northwestern and you studied, sort of traditional orchestra <span style="color:red" data-ts="487.48" data-end_ts="487.7" title="487.48" id=c_"487.48">__per__</span> performance and technique. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, it seems like something had to have happened for you to then all of a sudden show up at the US U U C S D experimental music program. Whether it's a bad acid trip or what, I'm not sure, but something had to kind of push you in that direction. Good 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>Point. Very good point. Lots of little things happened that led up to that. One was a very simple little thing, while I, while I was living, I, I owe it to Eric Dolphy, partly I was, you know, living in Chicago, listening to the radio, and they have such great radio programs there with such beautiful music. And here I'm listening to this flute player on the radio playing in <span style="color:red" data-ts="533.5" data-end_ts="533.62" title="533.5" id=c_"533.5">__it__</span> with a sound that was just not the sound that I was supposed to have, like I'd been working on sound for so long. And also precise pre precision, rhythmic, precision technique. Right, right, right. And here I hear the most gorgeous music I have ever heard on, on the flute. And with the sound with a flute sound that was just like, not the flute sound that I was trained to think that was the beautiful flute sound. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>It was this non beautiful flute sound. But the music was so beautiful and the flute was so, like, everything about it was so beautiful. And I, I, I thought, who in the world is this? Like, what is this? This is like, just, it just broke open my brain a little bit. Sure. And there it was, oh, that was Eric Doy on other aspects. And I like run to the record store time. Of course, there's record stores and there's a whole section of Eric Doy. I'm like, who is this guy? Right? Yeah. So I like grab like, you know, as many albums I can, I'm like listening to this and I'm thinking to myself, okay, what is going on? I, okay. That was gorgeous music that I loved, and I think there's a lot, I don't know, <laugh>. Right, right. And then I heard, I went to a concert, all flute players and, you know, it was these really cool flute players, people from, you know, all over the world, lots of different kinds of flute players. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>One was a Hollywood, you know, recording star, and we all kind of went to see this, this flutist. And, but then there was a guy from Japan who was playing not a Chachi, but a Traverse flute. And he says, you know, oh, you know, I'm gonna play the sounds of the ocean, this never ending sound of the ocean. And he begins to play, and I couldn't see him breathing, but he was circular breathing. Okay. And he was just like, he was playing this music that was, again, mind blowing for me. I, I, I couldn't, I thought, okay, wait, this is not <laugh> what I thought. I, <span style="color:red" data-ts="653.1" data-end_ts="653.22" title="653.1" id=c_"653.1">__I__</span>, there's a lot of music again. I was like, okay, there's a lot of music I don't know about. This is crazy. So I just started listening more and more and more to different kinds of music. And then I went to the National Flute Association, flute convention. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>And I was performing, I was playing in a masterclass, and I was very, like, very much at the time, like anti flute at that point. Im, you know, I was just like, I don't like flute players I don't like, and I'm going to this thing where there's, you know, thousands of flute players and I see John Fonville. John Ville is the flutist at <span style="color:red" data-ts="683.98" data-end_ts="684.1" title="683.98" id=c_"683.98">__E__</span> C S D teaches there. And he performed a piece called, music for Sarah at that time in San Diego. Anne LaBerge, <span style="color:red" data-ts="693.29" data-end_ts="693.58" title="693.29" id=c_"693.29">__Jose__</span> Vandenberg from, from Amsterdam. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="696.18" data-end_ts="696.38" title="696.18" id=c_"696.18">__east__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="696.38" data-end_ts="696.54" title="696.38" id=c_"696.38">__Van__</span> Mauss from Hungary, John Fonville and Robert Dick all had performances at this flute convention. Oh, wow. I saw all of them perform, and my mind was blown. And, and I went up to John Ville and I said, I know there's probably 300 flutists coming up to you, tell you how amazing you are, but I'm one of them <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>I just was wondering if maybe I could take a lesson with you. And he looked at me and he said, with a very straight face, you're the only person Yeah. Who's come up to me. And so at that point, I started taking lessons with him, and I realized that there was, because his music, his piece that I had heard him play was music for Sarah. And of course it had these influences. It just tears apart the flute in all of these different, it tears apart sound and breath and tonality in so many ways that I just thought, okay, I I have to be really serious about what I wanna do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>Yeah. So that was one. And I ended up going, I ended up eventually taking lessons with Anne and, and, and meeting Joe Denberg and playing with Robert <span style="color:red" data-ts="763.51" data-end_ts="763.86" title="763.51" id=c_"763.51">__Dicks__</span>. So I was like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="764.6" data-end_ts="764.82" title="764.6" id=c_"764.6">__as__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="765.11" data-end_ts="765.46" title="765.11" id=c_"765.11">__Matus__</span>, like, has heard my pieces and like, has had his students play some of them. So in the end, the world is very small. And I, and it's been wonderful, a wonderful journey. But, but yeah, and I went to, even to Paris at one point, to study with <span style="color:red" data-ts="778.54" data-end_ts="778.78" title="778.54" id=c_"778.54">__Perry__</span> Varto, to work on how to, you know, expand my sound even more and, and interpret new music. And it's been wonderful. I've been, it's been great <laugh>. It's been a great, great journey. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, okay. Thank you though, because that actually makes the Stepping Stones a little more clear. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And, but it also, it also begs a question to me, which is, so, so the works that you heard that that blew you away, or even, I mean, Eric Dolphy actually ends up being maybe a little bit more accessible if nothing else, then it's, you know, provided it was provided in recorded form with those incredible album covers. Right? Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But, you heard this music, to what extent did you have to have all of the background that you did in order to be able to approach that stuff? Or do you, or did it hit you at a more emotional level? I, you know, I always wonder this about <span style="color:red" data-ts="838.05" data-end_ts="838.34" title="838.05" id=c_"838.05">__were__</span>, were people excited, incited and incited by the intellectual leap that came with hearing new, new and experimental music? Or was it a pure emotional thing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>For me, it's both. For me, it's both, emotional in a sense that I definitely felt like my heart opened up when I heard this music from all over the world that was so incredible and, and, and, and, and, and thought about the tube and the voice and the resonance in so many new ways. Right. It was also intellectual because I, or maybe it's just my personality. Like, if somebody says to me, oh, you can't really do that, it's too hard. I'm probably gonna <laugh> safely. Oh, okay. So like, when I heard a piece, <span style="color:red" data-ts="890.75" data-end_ts="891.1" title="890.75" id=c_"890.75">__Mingo__</span> Global Car's, monolith, you know, a tape cassette of a live performance of, of, of, Robert Akin playing this piece, I was like, that's impossible. I'm gonna have to play that. Right. <laugh>, when, when I, when I, when I just looked at the score of, of Brian Furney ho's music, I was like, oh my God, that's insane. I'm gonna have to learn that. You know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>And same thing with improvisation, which is this like love hate relationship I have with it. You know, I just keep doing it because it, it, it, I just have to <laugh>. I feel like I have to conquer it or something. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, this goes back kind of to what you were talking about, about having kind of a <span style="color:red" data-ts="928.14" data-end_ts="928.34" title="928.14" id=c_"928.14">__com__</span> competitive nature, even in high school. Now, when you talk about that, are you talking about like a competitive nature around the musical instrument, or just in general? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>I think it's a mind game. Like, I think it's like, I want to get better at, at being me. Like, I wanna get better at expressing myself and 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>This <span style="color:red" data-ts="949.94" data-end_ts="950.1" title="949.94" id=c_"949.94">__flu__</span>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="950.1" data-end_ts="950.22" title="950.1" id=c_"950.1">__What__</span>, whatever it's, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>Yeah. Yeah. Like this flute is just like my voice. It's like this, it's like my other arm. Like, I don't know really how to ex express myself, without it, so, you know, learning these pieces, and it started really with learning contemporary music. I was really, really interested in contemporary music, as, as a junior and senior at Northwestern. And so I was already at that time playing music of my peers. And it wasn't until I started my last semester at Northwestern, I was actually in the room with the oscillators and cutting and pasting and doing looping with, you know, reel <span style="color:red" data-ts="986.98" data-end_ts="987.06" title="986.98" id=c_"986.98">__to__</span> reel tapes and things like that. And it was my last semester at Northwestern when I thought, oh my God, this is where I wanna start <laugh>, can I just start all over please and just have like, classes here? So all of these things started happening simultaneously, and that's when, and I started playing like Barrio sequin, and I realized that's a solo flute piece that is exactly a replica of being electronic music. Right. Like, I play that piece, like, I think of it as electronic music. So I guess my, it all started happening like kind of simultaneously. And by the time I got to U C S D, I was just really wanted to dive into that, you know? And by the time I was studying with, with not really studying, but working with Jose Manuel Begue in, in, Barcelona, I was really, I wanted to be like, how do I become a machine 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>? Right? Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>How do I become both like this organic human being that's got all of this heart, you know, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1047.22" data-end_ts="1047.42" title="1047.22" id=c_"1047.22">__want__</span>, I want to have that heart and love and emotion in it, and I wanna learn from all these different world traditions, but how do I combine that with incredible, magical aspects of the machine? You know? So that's what my, what I, what I've been trying to do is trying to connect those things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So you talk about, kind of looking over the shoulder of, of Begar, as being really important to you mm-hmm. <affirmative>, what are the things that you learned? What, what did you learn that you hadn't, hadn't imagined at that point? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>Hmm. Well, I guess I didn't realize that music could be made digitally in that way, and that you could, I didn't realize I didn't know anything about algorithms and how to like, put, and I still don't <laugh>, but I, I, I didn't realize that I could be this person who could play this organic, organic instrument. And it, that those sounds could be transformed into a whole new world with another kind of hybrid creature. It, it felt like I was playing with, we would call it the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1137" data-end_ts="1137.32" title="1137" id=c_"1137">__Bicho__</span> elcho, the, the little bug in Spanish as bug <span style="color:red" data-ts="1141.26" data-end_ts="1141.48" title="1141.26" id=c_"1141.26">__as__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1141.49" data-end_ts="1141.84" title="1141.49" id=c_"1141.49">__Bicho__</span>. Okay. And the, it, it, it had a little life of its own. And I didn't realize that, you know, I could be a part of that new exciting world where I could interact with this machine that was so playful and funny and totally quirky and crazy <laugh>, but that he made it, but that we, but then it was out of his, out of his hands. In a way. There was this randomness to it, this feeling of discovering the character of, of this music. And I had never realized before that that could happen, because up until that time, I had always played with, well, except for the students at U C S D, I had, I had usually played fixed media, electronic music, or I had worked with students, you know, who were creating the kinds of things that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1198.7" data-end_ts="1198.92" title="1198.7" id=c_"1198.7">__Sam__</span> Andel Beninger was, you know? Right. But with him, he was such a refined level, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The level of MA mastery. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>Right? Yes. His craftmanship at, with Max was just so great, that I had never seen anything quite like that. And it was super exciting for me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's interesting. Now, one of the things I'll say, and, and when I talk during the introduction about how, I, I actually find it, find your performance work kind of amazing. Some of it is because, you know, even now you're setting up systems for yourself, but you do something different than most of the cases where I see live performers working with electronics mm-hmm. <affirmative>, in a lot of cases like that, the, the live performer seems to be playing the role of like a complex oscillator, right? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And, when you play, there seems to be more of a dance between, the system and you are playing and you're interacting with it, even when you're working on composed pieces. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, is that some of what you're talking about having kind of mm-hmm. <affirmative> learned with mm-hmm. <affirmative>, learned in Barcelona? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>Yes. I, I learned that I am, I am both the connection, let's see. I'm the connection between that machine and the sound that the ul the ultimate hybrid sound I am, I am trying to create a high sound, but, but be a connector. And I'm also connect, like, so now with Ableton, I can, I can take, I can record the world around me, and then I can take little snippets of sounds and then I can stretch them and, and work with them behind the scenes, you know, and nobody's watching <laugh>. Right. And I can, I can create these little snippets of worlds and then I, in, in, and then I can play my flute. Like, for me, when I play the flute, then now I'm that world, like I think of the flute totally differently. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>And so when you say it's a dance, I love that, that, because first of all, I'm a very physical person, and I think, I think I really would rather be a dancer <laugh>. So, I love to be able to, you know, use the tube and the, all the things that the air molecules can do as it <span style="color:red" data-ts="1356.54" data-end_ts="1356.58" title="1356.54" id=c_"1356.54">__re__</span>, you know, as they <span style="color:red" data-ts="1357.7" data-end_ts="1358.06" title="1357.7" id=c_"1357.7">__flight__</span>, float through the tube and out into air, how I can, manipulate them in a way, in a new way, in a way <span style="color:red" data-ts="1366.14" data-end_ts="1366.26" title="1366.14" id=c_"1366.14">__of__</span>, that'll be surprising even to me, with the, the machine itself and with the, with these other sounds that I can control and not control. I love the idea of randomness and surprise. And so all of my pieces are structured improvisations, or they're called open score compositions. I'm not really sure which, in which there's always an element of play, of surprise, of randomness, of, I don't know what's gonna happen next. I just feel like it creates a more exciting, performance and also, it's kind of almost a ritualistic element that I'm interested in as well. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1402.98" data-end_ts="1403.14" title="1402.98" id=c_"1402.98">__Right__</span>, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I was gonna, I was going to say that, there's an element of surprise which kind of brings risk to the mm-hmm. <affirmative> to the performance, which I think, I think audience is key into that. I think that they know Yeah. They know when you're going to just regurgitate something mm-hmm. <affirmative> that you've done a thousand times, or when you're on the knife's edge and you're hoping things go well, <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>I just love watching those kinds of performances. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I do too. I do too. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>You know, I just, when I see John Butcher playing, I just know I'm never, I know, I don't know if he's gonna succeed or fail, and I just wanna be there. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="1439.41" data-end_ts="1439.7" title="1439.41" id=c_"1439.41">__when__</span> I see, you know, improvisers like that, and, and people, even if they're not improvising, people who are just artists who are really willing to take, to just bear it all out there and willing to take those risks, I, I feel somehow accomplice to that when I'm watching it. You know, I feel like I'm <span style="color:red" data-ts="1458.12" data-end_ts="1458.34" title="1458.12" id=c_"1458.12">__wa__</span> witnessing something I'll never witness again. Right. And I feel like life is just too short to, to not go, to not always be on the edge of something brilliant like that could possibly happen. And yes, it may fail, but I never think, you know, okay. It's a complete failure. But it's funny cuz like, sometimes when I think was a failure, other people don't, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1478.98" data-end_ts="1479.26" title="1478.98" id=c_"1478.98">__think__</span> it's several, you know, comp, you know, pieces of situations performing where, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1484.18" data-end_ts="1484.46" title="1484.18" id=c_"1484.18">__where__</span> people where I'm on stage thinking, oh, in agony, you know, oh my God, this is like the worst thing ever. And I come off the stage and people are like, oh my God, that was fabulous. You know? So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. One of the things, one of the things I certainly have learned is that if you think that you, you did poorly, uhhuh, <affirmative> just don't come off stage with kind of the sad face on right. <laugh>, because <span style="color:red" data-ts="1506.2" data-end_ts="1506.42" title="1506.2" id=c_"1506.2">__it__</span>, it may still represent the, the most intriguing thing someone has ever heard. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>Right 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, when you talk about the general case of working with your instrument, you often refer to it as a tube mm-hmm. <affirmative>, and I, I'd not heard you refer to it that way, but, I can see why you might say that because you are also, you also seem to really be interested in the entire world of music rather than just typical western or even western contemporary music. Right. Have you experimented much with instruments other than, other than a standard flute? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>Yes, I have, a bunch of different kinds of flutes. But I've never, I would, I would say that yes, I've experimented <laugh> with them. I've never mastered or learned another instrument from a different tradition or culture, partly because I was afraid I might not go back <laugh> right. To the regular flute. The Chachi is an instrument that is very intriguing to me. But when I went to Japan, for one of my times that I went for six months, I decided to study things that were not flute related. I, I'm afraid I won't, I'm afraid I'm just gonna put it down and put it away. And I feel like I've invested so much in it that I really want to expand this tool rather than spread myself out and you, and really learn extensively others. So I've played around with them. I have a lot of different kinds of flutes. I've listened to a lot. I've played with a lot of Chachi players and a lot of different kinds of musicians for sure. But I have not mastered any other tradition. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's, that's actually a really wonderfully thoughtful answer because I, I feel like sometimes when, and, you know, I hope I don't like goof up my ability to talk to anyone <laugh> in the future. But, I worry sometimes with people who find, you know, who go on exploration of world music and then become temporary, you know, in their own minds, become temporary masters at new instruments at a rate of about one every four months mm-hmm. <affirmative>, which means that they actually have no mastery at all, but they just become intrigued and all of a sudden, sort of like the glitz of something new happening three times a year becomes what they really get hooked on. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>Yeah. And I can understand why people, why that, why a lot of musicians do play a lot of, and become really good at a lot of different kinds of instruments. It's super intriguing and it does make you change. It's almost like learning another language. Like when I, when I learned Spanish or when I'm studying other, some other language, I feel like it opens my brain up and, and it makes me think in a completely different way from my own language. And, and, and it just allows me to be, just be in the world in a different way. But I, I want to transform. I wanna be a shapeshifter of this western orchestra flute. Like I want, I want that one. I wanna see what it can do. And that's why I went into electronics because I reached my edge. Like I, I tried to get so much technique, so much I tried to master so much on this flute, but it is just a tube and it is only certain length <laugh>, and there are only a certain number of, of holes on it and keys, and they're really, and it's made out of a particular kind of metal and that can't change. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>And so that's why I think, and that's why I add my voice, you know, so I added my voice, I added percussion, I added all these different mouth, you know, percussive funny little things that I can do, <laugh>. Right. But then it just got to the point where like, okay, I still have stuff in my head and I can't get it out electronics, yay, I can mm-hmm. <affirmative>, you know, go into that world now as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So before we talk more about the electronics, I want to talk a little bit about this, the various things you do, to sort of extend the use of the flute. So, a couple of weeks ago I was, talk, I talked with Jeff Kaiser mm-hmm. <affirmative>, you know, I know that he uses a variety of techniques with his trumpet playing, and I broached the subject of talking about extended technique. And he kind of talked about how he views anything that's done on the instrument as sort of idiomatic to that instrument mm-hmm. <affirmative> and so mm-hmm. <affirmative>, he didn't really run with the idea of an extended technique mm-hmm. <affirmative> now, at least at some point, you embraced extended technique enough so that my understanding from talking to people is that you kind of, formalized the discussion on some extended techniques in the flute area. Hmm. Would that be correct to say? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>I have no idea. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> you don't <span style="color:red" data-ts="1825.78" data-end_ts="1825.86" title="1825.78" id=c_"1825.78">__know__</span>, you don't <span style="color:red" data-ts="1826.5" data-end_ts="1826.58" title="1826.5" id=c_"1826.5">__know__</span> how you are, are framed. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>I don't, I actually don't. I just, this is the funny thing. In Western European classical tradition, anything other than how you're supposed to play the instrument is called an extended technique, you know? True. But in the world of the humanity, <laugh> in all of the world, you know, people play as, I'm gonna use the term again, tubes right. In a whole variety of way. We're curious people, I mean, human beings are curious by nature. And we, in all different parts of the world, there are so many different ways to explore sound. And, and, and instruments have personalities, and they're, they're, they're looked upon in different cultures, as having a kind of, spirit. Right? Right, right. And, and so how do you bring out that, that that voice, that spirit? How do you bring out the ancestors, you know, the voice of the ancestors? And so that's not extended technique, that's just playing the instrument or being in the, in or showing the voice of that particular object. Right? Sure, sure. So I also, I can, I, I have a hard time calling it extended techniques because they're not really extended. They're just exploring and having curiosity and, and discovering what one can do with what you have. But they are extended techniques. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, I, I was <span style="color:red" data-ts="1918.22" data-end_ts="1918.34" title="1918.22" id=c_"1918.22">__gonna__</span>, okay, well thanks for giving me that, cuz otherwise I was afraid I was gonna have to go pound the pavement looking for someone to just say, yeah, extended techniques, cool words, <laugh>. So, well, I at least you've given me a little of that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>So I think that, you know, we, we just feel like if you're doing something other than what you expect the instrument to do, then it's extended techniques. But, you know, with the flute, the, the typical ones are like key clicks and even flutter tongue, which is pretty basic. But there's many, there's two different kinds or more actually I've discovered of that kind of texture that you can create. There's singing and playing, there's, all sorts of percussive things that you can do something called a tongue ram and pikas slap kind of tongue. And there's, there's so many different things. Circular breathing is another kind of extended technique that's pretty basic in a lot of other cultures, you know? Right. So, you know, I just wanted to be able to do all of them, any of them. And through improvisation and playing with pretty hardcore improvisers, I've discovered new things that I could do, that I didn't know were possible. Mm-hmm. And also with electronics electronic, like playing with electronics, like forces, like I said before, forces me to think in a totally different way. And suddenly I'm like, oh my God. Now what was that <laugh>? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, I, you know, it's funny because when I hear you play, I actually, some of the stuff that you do, just with the instrument in your mouth a lot of times actually reminds me of things that different kinds of artists, particularly people that do kind of like glitch type music Yeah. Have a tendency to embrace the sound, you know, particularly some of the percussive things you do. Yeah. Or some of the, the singalong techniques so that you end up with like, kind of weird harmonic Right. Harmonic content for the combined tone. Right. Is really interesting and, and reminds me a lot of, you know, a completely different and very electronic Yeah. Kind of culture. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>Well, I'm really glad you mentioned glitch, music and, and, <laugh> micro sound stuff because that's, that's kind of what I really love. I love making amplifying new sonic worlds. I wanna bring people into the Tube <laugh>. Right. It sounds kind of weird, but I, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2066.52" data-end_ts="2066.74" title="2066.52" id=c_"2066.52">__you__</span> know, it's, it's super fascinating to me, and I do listen to that music and I do think about that. And maybe it's not purposefully trying to be glitch or anything like that, but I do think that has influenced me a lot. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, there's sort of like a cultural element that comes with it, so mm-hmm. <affirmative>, whether or not you're accomplishing, you know, an exact replica of that music. I think that having that mentality and that view of, I mean, cause let's face it, a lot of what Glitch is about is, is taking things that at one point were considered mistakes or problems mm-hmm. <affirmative> mm-hmm. <affirmative> and amplifying them mm-hmm. <affirmative> and focusing attention on them. Right. For their own artistic taste. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yes. So, interesting. You talk about how in 2003 you went to New York and you went to Harvest <span style="color:red" data-ts="2115.91" data-end_ts="2116.26" title="2115.91" id=c_"2115.91">__Works__</span> and began a new journey where you were trying to establish your vision of, of, of an instrument and of a performance mechanism that you were going to use mm-hmm. <affirmative>. What did that, what did that look like at that time? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>What did what look like my imagination, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What I could do <span style="color:red" data-ts="2134.98" data-end_ts="2135.1" title="2134.98" id=c_"2134.98">__mean__</span>? What <span style="color:red" data-ts="2135.18" data-end_ts="2135.22" title="2135.18" id=c_"2135.18">__was__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2135.22" data-end_ts="2135.3" title="2135.22" id=c_"2135.22">__what__</span>, what was, what was the system that you were, were trying to put together? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>Well, at the time, I do you mean what, what did I present at Harvest <span style="color:red" data-ts="2145.82" data-end_ts="2146.14" title="2145.82" id=c_"2145.82">__Works__</span>? Like what was, what, what was I making? What would I, what did I want to make? Is that what 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You Yeah, I guess, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2150.42" data-end_ts="2150.62" title="2150.42" id=c_"2150.42">__yeah__</span>, I guess, yes. Sure. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>I'll start with that because I think that's how I understand the question. I had a vision to create a piece that was like the equivalent of a storyteller, like an ancient shaman or a grio or a person who, you know, the bard who stands there in a room and creates magic with very, very little. So the idea at the time was that I wanted to mask or hide the electronics in some way. And what I wanted to do was to tell a story. And I divided up. I, I studied, you know, Joseph Campbell and all these different, the Singer of Tales and all these different ways that, that people tell stories, and they're all very similar how stories are told. And I created a five movement piece, each movement having a very specific, feeling or ambiance. And then I created a little tiny triggering device, little, little circuit boards, with, with five little push buttons that I would glue onto my flute. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>And it wasn't, with this double stick <span style="color:red" data-ts="2226.83" data-end_ts="2227.03" title="2226.83" id=c_"2226.83">__tick__</span> that was very, very, hard to get <laugh>. It was very specific place in New York I could get it. And, and then there were cables. It wasn't, it wasn't wireless, but I would hide them in my clothes and I would, I found a way that five, five little push buttons could do a lot of different things. One of them was actually was a switcher. So it would switch the functionality of, of all the other four switches. Okay. Buttons. And then, with this system, I could, I could control, again, moving forward in time. So my different preset, my different five movements, what would happen. Each of the five movements had a whole variety of, of sound files. And, I was using plug <span style="color:red" data-ts="2275.18" data-end_ts="2275.34" title="2275.18" id=c_"2275.18">__oh__</span> plugins at the time. And so, so a variety of v s t, you know, different sound processing would happen to my, my flute. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>And buffers would happen and recording things would happen. And then the sounds also how the sound traveled in the space through four speaker, the quadraphonic speakers. And that would change as well with each of the movements. There was a character, there were, there was a hero, there was the accomplice, there was the bad guy, you know, it was all this, it was quite a, a visual thing. And that work on that, piece, again, I was looking over, I could do max up to a point, but I couldn't do all of that. So again, I would, I had, you know, hired people to help me, and I would look over their shoulders and I could develop a vocabulary and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2328.06" data-end_ts="2328.14" title="2328.06" id=c_"2328.06">__a__</span> lingo to be able to explain to them, okay, this, thankfully with, with Jose <span style="color:red" data-ts="2332.06" data-end_ts="2332.46" title="2332.06" id=c_"2332.06">__Dengue__</span>, I could explore this, you know, in, in, in a whole new way and discuss with them exactly what I envisioned and what I imagined and what I wanted. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>We went through a whole bunch of different, triggering devices. You know, one was, one was a carpet, I was gonna put little devices on a carpet, and I would be walking around it. I mean, it was all sorts of different things that we came up, you know, flex sensors and Right. You know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2358.3" data-end_ts="2358.42" title="2358.3" id=c_"2358.3">__e__</span> everything we came, I just tried so many different iterations of this. And eventually I came up with my five, five little, but the problem, well, there <span style="color:red" data-ts="2367.5" data-end_ts="2367.54" title="2367.5" id=c_"2367.5">__were__</span> of course problems, <laugh>, technical problems, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2369.9" data-end_ts="2370.02" title="2369.9" id=c_"2369.9">__a__</span> lot of flutists were like, I want one, will you make one? You know? And it's a great idea. But there were a lot of, roadblocks that I discovered with this little five, push button triggering device system. So, I dunno if you want me to talk about the roadblocks, but 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>There will <laugh> Well, yeah, I think it's useful to talk about because, you know, I, I think that, I mean, what we're talking about really is sort of like an elementary controller system. Yeah. And even though controller systems kind of have toured a little bit mm-hmm. <affirmative>, I think that first of all, the environment in which you as, as a flute player has to deal with is kind of unique. I mean, you don't have your hands free. Right. So the box full of sliders is next to useless to you. Right. But, also, it, it strikes me, I mean, you, you tend to move around a lot. You tend to perform in a lot of different places or do workshops in places mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And, so building something that both can withstand that kind of travel, but also mm-hmm. <affirmative> is fairly easy to set up. Right. Is probably pretty important as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>Yes. Yes. And I, before that, I was playing with systems where I would be, have a, a foot, you know, a lot of foot switches mm-hmm. <affirmative>, and I wasn't really happy with looking down all the time or trying to memorize, you know, the, the complex dance that you have to do with all of these different, you know, foot, foot switches. Right. And I just, even today, I see players working with electronics and they're playing around with all of their foot switches, and I just get distracted as a, as a, as a looker, as an audience, as a person looking on. Sure. I, I get to distracted by watching them deal with their foot switches. And I wanted something that would, would provoke, would, would be magical. You know, at the time for the piece, it was really important that you couldn't really see how all of this was happening. You know? Now I'm not as concerned about that, but at the time, I really wanted to see if it was possible again, you know, like, give me a, you know, give me a, something to, to <laugh> to a challenge and I wanna try to do it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, you say <span style="color:red" data-ts="2506.66" data-end_ts="2506.9" title="2506.66" id=c_"2506.66">__you're__</span> maybe not as interested, but in, in a way, maybe it's actually more, more important now than it's ever been because it used to be that, you know, if you just showed up to, to do a performance and you had a laptop mm-hmm. <affirmative>, you were sufficiently weird to be able to be, you know, considered avant-garde just from that, right? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And then, but now the idea of every DJ being up there with a bunch of sliders or whatever, has sort of normalized this idea of performers with a, with a box of electronics in front of 'em mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And it, it actually makes this idea of like running wires inside of your clothes mm-hmm. <affirmative> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2550.5" data-end_ts="2550.7" title="2550.5" id=c_"2550.5">__that__</span> actually seem kind of, I'll use the word charming, and I don't mean it in a dismissive way, <laugh>, you know, but it charming. But it seems, it seems charming in a wonderful way. It seems to charming <span style="color:red" data-ts="2563.36" data-end_ts="2563.58" title="2563.36" id=c_"2563.36">__in__</span> a way that is also really thoughtful towards the audience. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>Yeah. I mean, I'm so interested in performance and, and what that means and the ritual of performance. It's always been a really, I think that's why I liked perform, you know, playing bingo global car or playing these pieces that push me beyond the edge. Because I feel of it. I feel like it's ritualistic and I feel that I, I want, I want the audience to, to, to go into another place as well. You know, I wanna, I don't wanna just be me. I want them to, to go somewhere else. You know, like the storytellers, like they, they, they take you with very little, just the words that they say and the way in which they say it to whole, the whole new worlds are opened up, you know? And I guess that's what I was trying to do at the time with that particular piece, was to not have any distractions. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>I wanted, I wanted there to be a kind of a magical element to it. You know? Now I'm, I'm still interested in, in performance and movement and, and how that and gesture and how they all relate and how sounds travel in space and how the performer interacts with that sound traveling in space and the relationship between that. But I, I didn't, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2643.3" data-end_ts="2643.42" title="2643.3" id=c_"2643.3">__u__</span> i i given up, so just temporarily, I'm still trying out different systems actually. I've got a couple of beta systems that I'm working on. I, but I have given up in performance at the moment in public, trying to hide anything. And in fact, my performances now look more like I'm DJing <laugh>. Yeah. I'm, I'm, I'm actually literally sitting down with the computer in front of me playing and working on the computer and I'm putting the flute down. You know, like that's where it's come to. It's like taken a whole other <laugh>. Right, right. Gone in the completely opposite direction at this point. Sure. So instead of trying to make any magic or anything, well, I'm just showing you here, here I am on stage showing you I'm working while I'm playing. Like I'm, this is all happening. Really. I'm doing it now, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Well, maybe one of the things that that does though, is it makes, and I don't know if this is good or not, you can tell me. Mm-hmm. It sort of makes clear the delineation when I hear something, the de delineation between what was done with the computer and what was done with the, with you. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> directly on the flute is very clearly delineated cuz I can see the computer and I can see when you're working on the computer mm-hmm. <affirmative>, and I can see when you're not 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>Yeah. Right. Putting the flute down or when Yeah. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Now, one of the things I would say is that, despite what we were just talking about a few minutes ago, a lot of times the work that I've, that I've heard you do has a very organic, and dare I say natural sound, you tend to, you like to, it seems work with, natural sound effects and field recordings, some mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah. And, how do you, how do you combine those, those two interests, the idea of the sound of the real world being, being very exciting, but so is the sound of like a hard drive failing or 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>Something? Exactly. Oh, I just, you know, I think it's just so wonderful that I can, we can all, you know, explore those two worlds as a hybrid world. That's what really is interesting to me. I mean, no matter what you do to the natural sounds that you take and disembody them and put them in your system, as soon as you do that, no matter what you do to those sounds, there's now not, now they're electronic and you're gonna hear, no matter what you do, you're going to hear the electronic manipul, the sound processing, the, the electronic manipulation of those. And why hide it, you know? Right. I, I don't, I don't mind that. I don't mind this, this new ins this new sound. I, I am I flute the same thing. As soon as you put a microphone to the flute, now it's, you're hearing the microphone. So it's, it's perfectly wonderful to me to, to create, for me it's na what both sounds are natural for 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. I see. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>Okay. And so I'm, I'm playing with all of that. I just wanna wanna play with all of that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that sounds really, exciting and interesting, and it also kind of maps out how you can extend what you've already done into the future. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2838.48" data-end_ts="2838.7" title="2838.48" id=c_"2838.48">__Now__</span> I want to ask you a question that goes back to something you said very early in our discussion, which was, you met the guy from U C S D at this flute conference mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And, he mentioned that you were the only person mm-hmm. <affirmative> to come talk to him mm-hmm. <affirmative>. I've, I've been to your performances and I've actually been really surprised and pleased with the number of people that come in to see your performances. You know, Colorado Springs, I don't think of as a particularly adventurous place mm-hmm. <affirmative>, but it seems like anyone who's adventurous seems to want to hear you do your work, which is, which is pretty awesome, <laugh>. Yeah. And while, and in one of the performances I saw there, you, you did, at least one world of a piece Yeah. That was, that was written, which I thought was really ex exceptional. How do you find in general acceptance for what you do versus, I don't know, I guess my, my assumption is if you said, Hey, I'm a orchestra flute player, and please come see my orchestra perform. People have a real sense of what that means, right? How do you give people the sense of what you do? Or don't you even care? I don't know. I, I'm curious about this. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>I'm, well, I, it's, it's hard. I, one part of me really wants people to, I wanna, I want people to hear what, what I'm trying to do with create, you know, be a part of this team, of all of us who're trying to create new sonic worlds to explore, and also to invite people to listen to the world around them in different ways when outside of the concert or outside of this moment. Now, I, I want people to accept it in a way, or at least be willing to give it a shot <laugh> and listen to it. Right. So, and then there's this other part of me that's, I really, I just do what I do, and if people come great, and if people hate it, that's fine too. Like, there's another part of me that the first person who has to accept what I do is me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>Right. And, and that is the most important. And if I, if I work really hard at being the best that I can be personally, not against anyone else, just the best that I, the best that I can offer that and accept whatever I am, and wherever I am and whoever I am at this very moment, then that's the most important for me. And if people are around to hear it, that's fabulous. Because then I get to learn more. I get to share and learn more from them. So I have these two, it's, it's difficult to balance it. I do live in an area where they're, you know, this is very strange, quote unquote strange music. But I also feel that no matter where I go, and I've traveled a lot, oh man. I mean, I've traveled a lot and, and everywhere I go, I just decide, okay, I'm just gonna do this. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>And if they like it, <laugh> great. And if they don't just, it's fine. And I don't, I don't think I've ever been in a concert where someone or many people have come up and said, this was so beautiful and you totally changed how I think about contemporary music, or how I think of the flute, or how I think of the world around me or my imagination. People come up with stories, you know, like, oh, well, when you were playing, was it supposed to be this like rocket ship? And then a bear came out and like <span style="color:red" data-ts="3060.94" data-end_ts="3061.42" title="3060.94" id=c_"3060.94">__wrapped__</span> the, you know, whatever, like, you know, there was a race and then somebody, and then the people come up with all these stories and I think, yeah, that's exactly what it was. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>How did you ever guess I had a spaceship with a bear? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>Yeah. Like, totally awesome, right? So, you know, I, I just do what I do and people are there. That's way more awesome, <laugh>, right? And then if they're not, then I'll just keep learning and growing. And I know that there's a community of musicians, global community of musicians who are doing what we're doing. And, we're all learning from each other. So I know I'm not alone 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right now. You ha you are just in the process of finishing up a, album of music, correct? Yes. Yes. You're doing it really the old fashioned way. You're doing studios and, and I am bringing, bringing, musicians into work with you, which is pretty impressive. And it seems, it, it seems like you're making an antiquity by doing that <laugh>, I hate to say, because yeah. It seems like nobody puts that kind of effort into it. Yeah. I'm really excited, I'm really excited for you to be doing this. Is this, well, what, what recorded, materials available for people to hear, first of all, that, that they can hear right now versus waiting for this <span style="color:red" data-ts="3143.6" data-end_ts="3143.82" title="3143.6" id=c_"3143.6">__new__</span> release 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b><laugh>? Well, yeah, I, this is my first CD that's mine that I've put together. Okay. And I've played a lot on other people's CDs. I've got, what's available now is, is online or on my website or by contacting me, or SoundCloud or whatever. What is available now, I've got work, I've got a CD out. It's actually another CDs coming <span style="color:red" data-ts="3174.92" data-end_ts="3175.14" title="3174.92" id=c_"3174.92">__too__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3175.16" data-end_ts="3175.38" title="3175.16" id=c_"3175.16">__too__</span> are gonna be coming out very soon. One is with Augusti Fernandez, catalan, com, pianist. So that'll be, there's one already out and we've made our second one, and we're gonna be recording for our third one, next year. What's available, it's hard to get stuff that I'm doing. I'm more of a live performer. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That's, oh, I, I certainly resonate with that. Yeah. I have the same, when people ask me that question, I have the same, difficulty giving a straight answer, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="3203.82" data-end_ts="3203.94" title="3203.82" id=c_"3203.82">__Oh__</span>, good. I'm not the only one. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, but, you will ha you do have some stuff on your website that people <span style="color:red" data-ts="3211.38" data-end_ts="3211.58" title="3211.38" id=c_"3211.38">__will__</span> be able to check on. All right. Great. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3212.59" data-end_ts="3212.94" title="3212.59" id=c_"3212.59">__Cause__</span> I wanna make sure that people get a chance to get some ears on it. Yeah. When do you think that your, your solo work is going to come out? Do you have a feel for that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>Yeah. And, and again, it's not solo work, but, for, first I'll say when, when, when is gonna be not quite sure yet. It's, it's just finished being mixed and I'm now sending it out to labels. Okay. So hopefully a label will, will wanna put it out soon. So I, I'm hoping by the beginning of the year, I don't know how long all that takes, but that's what I'm, I'm hoping for. All right. Who else is on it? Ko Nagai piano, Janet <span style="color:red" data-ts="3251.72" data-end_ts="3252.14" title="3251.72" id=c_"3251.72">__Fetter__</span> on prepared guitar and banjo and other kinds of string instruments. And Satoshi Tahi is playing percussion and electronics, and there's a, a wide variety of me with some, with overdubbing flutes and lots of piccolo. I'm totally fascinated with the piccolo, actually. And music with them <span style="color:red" data-ts="3274.52" data-end_ts="3274.74" title="3274.52" id=c_"3274.52">__mu__</span> some duets. There's a piccolo and accordion piece. There's a, a variety of different kinds of things. It, it, it mixes acoustic and electroacoustic, music all, all in this one cd. So it's, it's quite a variety. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that sounds pretty, pretty awesome. I'm looking forward to hearing it again. I've been looking enough to see you in performance a couple of times. I've been always blown away by that. So I'm really looking forward to this work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>Well, thank you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>All right. Well, and with that, I want to thank you for your time and, spending, taking the opportunity to teach me a little bit, both about where you personally are coming from, but also that, mix and match of the historically orchestral works with, modern, the dance of modern modernity, I guess is, the phrase for it. So thank you so much, and, thank 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>You, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Darwin Have a great day. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jane: </b>Thanks, you too. It's been such a pleasure. Thank you. Yeah, bye 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nobody: </b><i>Bye. </i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And there it is, even more fun with extended technique <laugh>. That's always fun. But also a really great insight on the making of an artist. And also I think not a lot of people who are into experimental, especially electronic music, have a lot of flute on their radar. And it's probably too bad because it seems to be a pretty incredible instrument to interact with electronics. So we say thank you to Jane for that fantastic interview. I would like to take this opportunity to say thank you to all of you listeners, to everyone that helps out with this. And, please do me a favor this week and introduce the podcast to some new people. We're beginning year two now, so it's time to let everybody know we're still here. In the meantime, I'll just keep on pumping these out and you keep on listening. Thanks.
