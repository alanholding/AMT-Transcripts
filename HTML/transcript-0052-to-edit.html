<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, today we're going to be talking to somebody. I, I just recently met his name's <span style="color:red" data-ts="13.53" data-end_ts="13.82" title="13.53" id=c_"13.53">__Miko__</span> Vogel. He actually reached out to me, he's the listener of the podcast. He was like, Hey, I'm gonna be in town, with this group and maybe we can get together. And I was like, well, sure, as long as we get to record it as an interview. And so he's, he's in town working with the band Cut Copy. And, he actually got me into the show and it was really pretty amazing thing. It, it, in a way, it kind of felt like, like 1982 all over again or something, but it is really interesting music. They really knew how to play the audience. It was a lot of fun. And the show itself was just pretty amazing. And so this, it's a really great opportunity to talk to <span style="color:red" data-ts="59.93" data-end_ts="60.22" title="59.93" id=c_"59.93">__Miko__</span> about that. But also he does a lot of stuff. We had a chat before the show and he started talking about all the things he did and it kind of blew me away. So, hi Miko. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko Vogel: </b>I'm good though. And how are you going? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm doing fine. Rather than define you myself, I'm gonna have you define yourself. So why don't you tell us what, what, how you think of yourself. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>Okay. I think probably, I think of myself as a person that helps people make things, in music and art. I think that's sort of been the one thing that I can sort of correlate between all the different projects that I've ever worked on. They're very rarely sort of solo things, but they're generally always related to helping others, make something good happen. So that's sort of been my, that's I guess been my main thing that I've always tried to do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see. That's, that's <span style="color:red" data-ts="121.06" data-end_ts="121.18" title="121.06" id=c_"121.06">__a__</span> interesting way to frame it. So now what are some of the things that you've done that, that people might, might know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>Well, I've worked with, this band cut copy for quite a few years, and I started out as their recording engineer for an album called Zno <span style="color:red" data-ts="138.46" data-end_ts="138.66" title="138.46" id=c_"138.46">__Scope__</span> that, we recorded in 2010, I think. And so my relationship with them has sort of grown quite a lot. And I ended up working on doing all the programming for their live show after we did the, after we recorded the record, and then I went on the road as their, production manager and as their programmer. And, and then I ended up playing percussion in the band as well. And then we started, we, well we recorded another record called Free Your Mind a couple of years ago. And so that's sort of when I, after the recording of that record, I did the pre-production for them. And I guess when I say pre-production, sort of remixing the record for, for the live show and sort of working with them on all the instrumentation and yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>All of that kind of stuff. So that's sort of been my, my touring work for the last few years. And then I've worked with lots of other bands as tour as a tour manager in Australia and around Asia and the rest sort of parts of the rest of the world as well. So for about the last, I guess 10, 15 years I've worked with bands either in a studio or on tour. Yeah. And I, and I used to play in a band, so that's sort of how it all started. I, I started, playing drums in a band in Brisbane, in Australia, like the north of Australia. Right. And it sort of naturally progressed into working with other bands, as a sound engineer and, yeah, sort <span style="color:red" data-ts="234.32" data-end_ts="234.4" title="234.32" id=c_"234.32">__of__</span>, it's always, it's always seemed like quite a natural progression from making music to then helping others make music and then going back to making music again. And, and then <span style="color:red" data-ts="243.76" data-end_ts="243.96" title="243.76" id=c_"243.76">__ended__</span> ending up sort of working Yeah. A lot into management as well. And yeah, helping other people make their projects work properly, I guess. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That's, that's really interesting. But it also is a pretty wide, wide amount of work. And also when we talked, you mentioned that you've done, you know, some things with, sound design or, or composition for games and just kinda have your fingers in a lot of things, it sounds like. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>Yeah. Yeah. I think, well, about two years ago, we moved to London and I really, I guess I kind of really wanted to get off the road 'cause I'd been touring in some capacity for a long time. And, so I just sort said, well, when I get to London, I'm just gonna say yes to everything. Oh. Like if someone says, <span style="color:red" data-ts="291.9" data-end_ts="292.12" title="291.9" id=c_"291.9">__can__</span>, can you do this? I was like, sure, I can do that <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, that's a great way to go. I'm 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>Sure. So I <laugh>, so I <span style="color:red" data-ts="298.12" data-end_ts="298.2" title="298.12" id=c_"298.12">__was__</span>, I, I, I landed <span style="color:red" data-ts="299.66" data-end_ts="299.88" title="299.66" id=c_"299.66">__in__</span>, a friend of mine was working on a, on a composition project for Selfridges, which is this big sort of, department store, very fancy department store in London. And he needed somebody to basically program this generative sculpture that he'd made. And so that was sort of the first thing that I started working on, which is sort of how my interest in programming in the last few years has come up. And then through doing a few more of these projects, I now <span style="color:red" data-ts="329.04" data-end_ts="329.24" title="329.04" id=c_"329.04">__work__</span>, do a lot of work for TV shows. And so I <span style="color:red" data-ts="332.92" data-end_ts="333.08" title="332.92" id=c_"332.92">__work__</span>, do, do some work for M T V and via like other Viacom companies. And I, I've just finished mixing the soundtrack for a computer game called Sonic the Hedgehog, which is like a, I guess coming out on the Nintendo towards the end of the year. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b><laugh>. Okay. So that was, that was a really interesting project to do this year. And that sort of came about from me renting a studio from the composer that was doing, I guess doing all the composition for the game. And he needed a, you know, someone who's sort of experienced in doing really large mixing projects. Right. And so we just got talking and that's how that started. So it's been a really very, <span style="color:red" data-ts="375.54" data-end_ts="375.76" title="375.54" id=c_"375.54">__we__</span> varied kind of couple of years <laugh> for me. But I, it's sort of the way I like it, you know, rather than just doing one thing over and over again, it seems like every sort of couple of months something new happens and it just Yeah. Keeps me excited about working on, it keeps, yeah, it just keeps me excited about working in music and art and all different kinds of media things. And I guess maybe the sides, the side effect of that is that you sort of, I, well I end up doing lots of things, but never mastering any one of them <laugh> <span style="color:red" data-ts="412.71" data-end_ts="413.2" title="412.71" id=c_"412.71">__because__</span> I'm constantly changing. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="415.08" data-end_ts="415.2" title="415.08" id=c_"415.08">__I__</span>, I see what you're saying. But on the flip side, I mean that, that kind of seems like the modern work environment though too. I mean, if you're working in art, you have to be kind of a utility outfielder because you have to be able to say yes to anything that walks, walks up. And that really means that you have to have a, a pretty deep background to be able to, to actually say yes to everything. So that begs the question, which I often <span style="color:red" data-ts="440.62" data-end_ts="440.84" title="440.62" id=c_"440.62">__ask__</span> in the podcast. What in your background is it that makes you this sort of like multi-varied artist? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>I think, I dunno, I probably have my parents to thank for that. So we, I I, I grew up in Germany and in some my early schooling I went to this school called the Rudolph Steiner School, which I don't <span style="color:red" data-ts="463.92" data-end_ts="464" title="463.92" id=c_"463.92">__know__</span> if you've heard of that. I <span style="color:red" data-ts="464.68" data-end_ts="464.8" title="464.68" id=c_"464.68">__dunno__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="464.8" data-end_ts="464.84" title="464.8" id=c_"464.8">__if__</span> Yes, I have. Yes. I think they have them in the States as well. So I went to this, the Rudolph Steiner School, and they, yeah, I guess it's a, it's a sort of a schooling system really focused on creativity and, still, I mean there's still a very sort of academic element to it, but it's, it's more about bringing, bringing out, sort of the creative spirit in kids. And so for the first few years of my schooling, I went to this Rudo Stein school and my parents always really encouraged me to learn instruments. And, so I learned lots of different instruments throughout school. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>And then, early on I got really into recording technology and I guess <span style="color:red" data-ts="503.76" data-end_ts="503.92" title="503.76" id=c_"503.76">__this__</span> sort of when computers started getting good enough to, to work with audio without having to spend a huge amount of money, and I guess it was sort of maybe in grade, maybe it was like grade 10 or something that I re it was grade, yeah, grade eight or nine 10, somewhere around there. And I did some work experience, like, I guess they probably have that in the states as well, like, you know, work placement for kids to sort of, try out a bunch of different career paths. And so I did this WIC experience thing in, in a music shop and they had a whole bunch of old drum machines there. So I bought all the old drum machines that they had for like $50 and I think I got six or seven of them <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>And <span style="color:red" data-ts="551.2" data-end_ts="551.32" title="551.2" id=c_"551.2">__I__</span> ended up trading some of them for a, a 3, 8, 6 computer with a MIDI card in it. And that's sort of how my, my music tech stuff started was with this computer and a MIDI that had a MIDI output card in it. And my parents were always really encouraging. So, I, I think I have them to thank for the, for the background in, being able to try my hand at a lot of different things, <laugh> Sure. And not just concentrating on one thing. Yeah. But I think it's also maybe a, an attention span thing, you know? Yeah, maybe I've got a bit of, I dunno if I've got an attention problem, but I like doing lots of things. It's like, like if I can see that I can help someone make something good, then I'm generally really interested in following it through. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That makes sense. Now, when you were talking about, when you were talking about your work and particularly your work with Cut Copy, you talked about programming the live show. I think that a lot of people, myself included, don't have a real clear vision of what that means. Could you kind of fill us in on that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>Sure. Well, I guess the big thing with electronic acts, and I cut copies sort of, I guess there's two elements to the <span style="color:red" data-ts="633.6" data-end_ts="633.76" title="633.6" id=c_"633.6">__band__</span>. There's, you know, a very live element, and then there's lots and lots of electronics on stage. And so my job during pre-production was firstly to take, take the record apart that we'd recorded and mix, <span style="color:red" data-ts="649.06" data-end_ts="649.48" title="649.06" id=c_"649.06">__pulled__</span> it into something that can be played. And so some things, you know, we could sort of put on samples, and I don't know if you saw that at the show, but we have all these sort of trigger, midi triggers on stage everywhere, and they all trigger sort of different samples and instruments and things within the computer system. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Are you talking about all of the, the keyboards or did you, or do you have other triggering devices 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>As well? <span style="color:red" data-ts="674.52" data-end_ts="674.68" title="674.52" id=c_"674.52">__Yeah__</span>, there's like, these <span style="color:red" data-ts="675.78" data-end_ts="676" title="675.78" id=c_"675.78">__aai__</span> M<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data">PD</a>s, so like, oh yeah. So there's like little, little middy trigger things. So we have three of them <span style="color:red" data-ts="682.82" data-end_ts="683.04" title="682.82" id=c_"682.82">__or__</span> all around the stage, sending MIDI into the Ableton rig, and then we have lots of midi going out of the Ableton rig into all of the keyboards. Sure. And, and there's sort of, I guess there's three keyboards and syn. And it's basically trying to sort of, the, the programming I guess relates to taking all of the elements, electronic elements or acoustic elements from the record and trying to figure out how we can sort of reproduce it live. And I mean, there's some things that, you know, can obviously be played really easily, but then other things need to have, be have like, you know, automated effects and things on them. Right. Some of them, you know, you might not be able to trigger like a really fast sequence of notes, but if you hold a trigger pad down, we can sort of trigger a whole sequence of notes. And, but basically trying to make it as live as possible even though some of it's really heavily sequenced. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, one of the things I noticed in watching the show too was that there was a, there was a pretty interesting dance going on as like, you know, one guy, he's coming in with guitar and then he's playing Tim Balis, then he's playing a synth, then he's got another guitar again, you know? Yeah. And, and on the other side of the stage, a guy going back and forth between synth and bass, I think he's plays guitar some maybe. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. And then your front man, also he was playing synth live and, and he was clearly live because he was like goofing around with filter sweeps and stuff like that. Yep. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>It's quite a bit of that going on <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. But how do you, how do you combine that with sort of, <span style="color:red" data-ts="796.62" data-end_ts="796.84" title="796.62" id=c_"796.62">__how__</span>, how do you take, take that, the desire to have that live activity and kind of mesh it in with what was, in some cases there was some like extremely complex sequence parts going on. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>Yeah. I guess that was sort of the challenge. And a lot of it is, I guess, an evolution over time as well. You know, you sort of start out with an idea of how it can work in theory, and then when you start putting it into practicing, <span style="color:red" data-ts="825.44" data-end_ts="825.64" title="825.44" id=c_"825.44">__oh__</span> actually maybe that, that sort of won't work <laugh> quite, quite as we'd expected. So a lot of it is, is just an evolution over time. And the, it always starts out as quite a simple idea, so we can sort of, you know, break down things like, oh, we can pretty much play this and we can get this person to trigger this. And, there's a, you know, there's enough time between the, this bass part and then being able to go back and sort of cover this other synth part over here. And then while this guy's doing a guitar, sort of improvisation, the drama starts the sequence that, you know, can make this synth do, you know, send MIDI to this synth and send patch changes to these other keyboards and stuff. So it's sort of, yeah, it starts out as quite a simple idea. And then, I guess it's, it ends up being a compromise between what's realistically possible timing <span style="color:red" data-ts="884.6" data-end_ts="884.88" title="884.6" id=c_"884.6">__wise__</span> for people in the band and what we just leave off. Right. But essentially it's as live, live as it can possibly be with that amount of people, you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Know. Yeah. Well, it was clear that, that all the members of the band were kind of like flying around to make things happen. <laugh>, how much do you end up having to simplify the songs in order to make them viable live? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>I think that depends on the song, but the way that we recorded the records was sort of as a band. So, Dan the, the singer would sort of come in with some ideas sort of sketches, I guess. And then we'd sort of spend days really in this, studio that we built just, just jamming stuff out. And the way that I approached the recording of it, I guess it sort of translates into how it the productions get built, is that everything was just rolling the whole time. So we never hit stop on the Sure. On the, on the recording. We just, just recorded everything and then we'd sort of whittle away the bits that we didn't like and it something good would come out of that. So they all start around quite a basic sketch and then get built into something that the whole band plays and has played. So I think the, the, the, the motivation and the, the starting point is always from a bunch of guys making music rather than, you know, a precon sort of preconceived musical idea that <span style="color:red" data-ts="978.4" data-end_ts="978.56" title="978.4" id=c_"978.4">__that__</span>, that then has to be done by four people. It always starts out as a thing that four people make. And then you sort of fill in the gaps with the things that is not possible for four people to all do at the same time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Right. Well that's, you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>Know what I mean, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Because cut copy is pretty unabashedly pop music, right? Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>Yeah. Absolutely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You were gracious enough to sort of like say, here's some things to listen to, you know, before I went to the show. So I kind of went to the show aware of what I was going to be hearing. And, it's really interesting because while it's purely, you know, it's really pop music, it also isn't kind of the prefab pop that so often, so often when there's pop that's electronic in nature, it has this kind of prefabricate <span style="color:red" data-ts="1026.45" data-end_ts="1027.12" title="1026.45" id=c_"1026.45">__fabricated__</span>, feel to it. Yeah. Cut <span style="color:red" data-ts="1029.8" data-end_ts="1030.04" title="1029.8" id=c_"1029.8">__copies__</span> really doesn't. And it's interesting, I mentioned last night to some of my students that I had been at the Cut copy show and they're like, oh, I love that band. You know, it was, there's is a lot of interest in recognition of what they were doing Now. I have a question because on stage, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1050.9" data-end_ts="1051.12" title="1050.9" id=c_"1050.9">__and__</span>, and you knew me enough to know that I would be interested in this I stage you have a lot of kind of the new generation of electronic music gear. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. And which is really cool. And, and new analog systems especially. So there was some, I think, I saw some Dave Smith stuff. I saw <span style="color:red" data-ts="1072.39" data-end_ts="1072.68" title="1072.39" id=c_"1072.39">__Milk__</span> Voyager, I think I saw one of the mini Corg things. Yeah. I don't know what keyboard, the guy on my, my right hand side was playing. He had some very small thing, I don't know what that was, but couldn't really see it 'cause it was a little dark on that side of stage. But nevertheless, you know, very much the modern analog sound and it kind of fits with the sound of the band. My question is, since you were involved in the recording and the production, is that something that they came to you saying, we love these machines, or was it more you saying, here are some machines to consider, check 'em out, or, yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>That's, that, that's kind of how it happened. So the Dan has a lot of really amazing, gear at home, but it's sort of completely impractical to tour it. So he had like, a lot of what was used for the record was like a CS 80 Yamaha CSS 80, and a Jupiter eight and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1132.52" data-end_ts="1132.64" title="1132.52" id=c_"1132.52">__a__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1132.84" data-end_ts="1132.96" title="1132.84" id=c_"1132.84">__a__</span> Profit five and you know, like an old eight, you know, a 8 0 8 drum machine and a 3 0 3 and all this kind of stuff. But it's all, you know, really, they're definitely not roadworthy 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh no. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>Machines <laugh>. And so, and that was actually the, the same on the last record that we did as well. And so we, yeah, we sort of tried to choose gear that would sort of, I guess, complement the sounds that, all of those great instruments make, but in something that is a little bit more roadworthy. And also, you know, because these things get, unfortunately, get destroyed pretty regularly by the airlines. It's also something you can walk into most music shops in big cities Right. And be able, and be able to buy another one. And actually, the only thing that we've had that hasn't really been that way is that we had on the last tour that I did with them, we had a synthesizers.com modular that we toured Yeah. As well. And that was actually surprisingly stable. I thought that was, it was gonna be a really kind of a hard, a hard machine to work with, but it was amazing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>It was really, really stable. The tuning was amazing, and it brought such an amazing, capability to the show. 'cause like, you know, in all of these songs, we could just send MIDI to it. Right. And Dan would just be able to sort of, I guess like bliss out on these <laugh>, you know, really complicated patches. But so ama like amazingly creative kind of thing. So we've sort of, I guess we try as, as much as possible to, stay true to the way that the instruments that we used on the record, but then at the same time try and make them roadworthy and Yeah. But <span style="color:red" data-ts="1247.92" data-end_ts="1248.08" title="1247.92" id=c_"1247.92">__they__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1248.08" data-end_ts="1248.32" title="1248.08" id=c_"1248.08">__they__</span>, we've sort of been gone through quite a lot of equipment, with this band, just in the test, like in the pre-production phase where we'd sort of say, oh, maybe we should try this keyboard for this part. And, you know, like they really wanted like this house piano kind of thing. Right. Like, well, I mean, you know, I guess we could get a Cog M one, but <span style="color:red" data-ts="1268.34" data-end_ts="1268.56" title="1268.34" id=c_"1268.34">__Wow__</span>. They're getting kind of old now as well, and that would be quite difficult to find a replacement for, even though they made, you know, 140,000 of them <laugh>. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>There's, they're not really like an off the shelf item anymore. And I said, well, I think those little cog kind of like micro station things or whatever they're called, you know, there's like multi multi cogs <laugh>. Right, right. I said, I think they have like one of those, you know, kind of crappy house piano patches in them. And it just works perfectly and you know, know's pretty, they're pretty cheap. Like when you consider it for a touring band, they're not, it's not, there's not a huge, huge infrastructure. And now we have a, you know, a suitcase full of them <laugh> of course. So if one, if one breaks, we can just get another one and plunk it down. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, even, even still though, I mean, some of these systems you're touring with, are a lot more fragile than just a laptop with live running on it or something. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>But that in itself is quite fragile as well, you know? Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's true. That's, yeah. But at least, at least, with the laptop, you can carry it through t ss a yourself instead of having them rifling through your road cases. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>Yeah. T s a have come up with some pretty amazing modular patches. Actually, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, sorry, I was taking a drink right when you said that <laugh>. Yeah. It's, I'm sure Roger, eric from synthesizers.com if, he'll be happy to hear that you took it on tour, but even maybe more happy to hear that T s a got a chance to be a little creative too. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>Yeah. Yeah. Turns out Caroline at the, Connecticut International Airport is amazing at modularity. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, you, you know what I mean? There was all those prog rock bands and they disappeared and you wondered what happened to those people. Maybe they're all working for TSA now, right? <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Keith, Keith Emerson's got a job at the tsa, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Or at least his roadie does <laugh>. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>Exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So yeah. When you're making the transition from the recorded work to something you're gonna play live, do you have kind of a matrix that you use? Like, okay, I used the Jupyter eight on this. That part's gonna work well on a profit. Do you have like common things that you map? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>No, not really. I think it's more of a, I mean, a lot of it's trial and error, and actually a lot of it you can, well, we were able to do really well with guitar pedals, so we'd sort of, I mean the Profit eight, the nude, the nude Dave Smith stuff is, like, it's an ama, they're amazing keyboards and incredibly flexible. And so a lot of it, like, you know, a lot of the CS 80 stuff is, I guess in the chorus mm-hmm. <affirmative> that's in, that's sort of built into the CSS 80 D in the way that, pardon me, that sort of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1445.52" data-end_ts="1445.72" title="1445.52" id=c_"1445.52">__notes__</span>. Its chorus together and, yeah. So a lot of that we could actually end up doing with guitar pedals. Oh, sure. Okay. And, you know, various delays and things. And so that sort of added a really, a really kind of cool dimension. So like Dan has a really big pedalboard full of different guitar pedals that his keyboard runs through and, you know, different songs <span style="color:red" data-ts="1464.54" data-end_ts="1464.76" title="1464.54" id=c_"1464.54">__we__</span> sort of switch to different, to different things. And, and the, the programming in the Prophet <span style="color:red" data-ts="1470.24" data-end_ts="1470.52" title="1470.24" id=c_"1470.24">__eight__</span> is so deep you can, and it reads really well. I guess that's the other kind of thing. It's like sometimes things that read well on record, maybe actually don't read that well through a big PA system. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, sure. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>And the, the new D ss i stuff has got such great bite to it mm-hmm. <affirmative>, that it can really, it can work really well to cover a lot of those things. So the C S A D I think it can do really well and, you know, in an extremely, it's a new way of, it's, it doesn't sound exactly like it obviously, but it sounds different yet really cool in the same way, you know, it still has a wobble to it. And, all the things that sort of make the C ss a D really special and, and it can do, you know, some of the Jupiter stuff really well because of the way you can stack oscillators in it. And Yeah. I think <span style="color:red" data-ts="1525.32" data-end_ts="1525.48" title="1525.32" id=c_"1525.32">__that__</span> most, most of it <span style="color:red" data-ts="1526.2" data-end_ts="1526.36" title="1526.2" id=c_"1526.2">__is__</span> sort of ends up being in the tweak boxes, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1529.33" data-end_ts="1529.68" title="1529.33" id=c_"1529.33">__which__</span> I call 'em, you know, like things that we can sort of send <span style="color:red" data-ts="1531.56" data-end_ts="1531.72" title="1531.56" id=c_"1531.56">__media__</span> to and, you can just sort of tweak around on them. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1534.78" data-end_ts="1535" title="1534.78" id=c_"1534.78">__Oh__</span>, right. The 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>Middle of the show. So we, yeah, we used to have this synthesizers.com thing, but now all of the tweak stuff is being done with, the Moog Voyagers. So we have like one Rack Moog Voyager, and then one, keyboard version of the Moog Voyager. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Did I see that there's some sort of like activator on that, on that keyboard mug that lights up when he is playing it or something? There's like some mid light or something 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>Hilarious. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1560.76" data-end_ts="1561.04" title="1560.76" id=c_"1560.76">__Yeah__</span>, there's the, the, the Voyager has the rack version of the Voyager has this really crazy backlight uhhuh to it, and there's actually, there's a knob on the front. Oh, there <span style="color:red" data-ts="1569.72" data-end_ts="1569.8" title="1569.72" id=c_"1569.72">__is__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1569.82" data-end_ts="1570.04" title="1569.82" id=c_"1569.82">__it__</span> just, it's just a dimmer for the light <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh wow. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>Hilarious. It's pretty, it's pretty deluxe, but then, you know, they're very expensive, so I'm glad they put a really fancy looking feature on it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Right, good point. Something something to make it worth having on stage 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b><laugh>. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. But that, that was sort of the thing that ended up being able to as closely approximate a lot of the modular stuff without shipping the synthesizers.com stuff around. Right. And then we tried a couple of Euro rack things and, we tried some of the, smaller, like semi modular things as well. Sure. Right. And the Moog was sort of the only thing that really has that, at least for those sort of really subby <span style="color:red" data-ts="1615.16" data-end_ts="1615.4" title="1615.16" id=c_"1615.16">__base__</span> parts sort of had the, the fullness I think that we were looking for. Right. But yeah, you know, I think it's, it's, it's, there's no set way that we, that I, at least that I approached how things <span style="color:red" data-ts="1629" data-end_ts="1629.16" title="1629" id=c_"1629">__were__</span> done. You just try a bunch of stuff. And, in our case, we had some really great music shops that would sort of lend us things <laugh>. Yeah. That's awesome. So, you know, we just <span style="color:red" data-ts="1637.4" data-end_ts="1637.56" title="1637.4" id=c_"1637.4">__going__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1637.56" data-end_ts="1637.76" title="1637.56" id=c_"1637.56">__to__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1637.95" data-end_ts="1638.24" title="1637.95" id=c_"1637.95">__look__</span>, I mean, they know that we were somewhere we were going to spend enough money to buy equipment for a whole year of touring. Right. So they were, yeah. They were really nice to <span style="color:red" data-ts="1649.1" data-end_ts="1649.32" title="1649.1" id=c_"1649.1">__us__</span> and we ended up having a really good relationship with them to try out something. And if it didn't work, we could sort of bring it back and try something else. And yeah. So there's a lot of driving backwards and forwards from the music shop <laugh> as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Had you had much experience with old analog systems and stuff yourself prior to working with the band? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>Yeah, so I've had, I've had a, a Euro rack system I think since I was 19 or something. And I've, I've went through phases in my life where I spent all the money that I had on keyboards, <laugh>, and I, I'm glad to say I think I've broken the addiction of collecting analog since now. But I used to have a lot of them, and so <span style="color:red" data-ts="1697.36" data-end_ts="1697.48" title="1697.36" id=c_"1697.36">__I__</span>, I was, yeah, I was really familiar with, with keyboard tech and MIDI stuff, and a lot of my own composition, stuff sort of revolves around modular, modular synthesis and, mini sort of manipulated electronic things. And so, so my, like, my interest in music has always been very much, electronic. So it's sort of, I think that's why I ended up getting along so well with these guys and have worked with them for so long. Because musically we come from a really similar background. Right. And instrumentally, I think the same is the same can be said. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That's that's interesting. Now, you, in addition to your work with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1744.2" data-end_ts="1744.36" title="1744.2" id=c_"1744.2">__Cut__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1744.36" data-end_ts="1744.6" title="1744.36" id=c_"1744.36">__Copy__</span>, I know that you've, you actually shared with me like an albums worth of material, that you have put together, and I think you're shopping it around right now to labels, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>Yeah. Well, a friend of mine, Laurens <span style="color:red" data-ts="1757.24" data-end_ts="1757.44" title="1757.24" id=c_"1757.24">__English__</span> from Australia is gonna release this first sort of lot of stuff. He, so he runs a really great <span style="color:red" data-ts="1763.72" data-end_ts="1764" title="1763.72" id=c_"1763.72">__label__</span> or a group of labels, and I think the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1765.72" data-end_ts="1765.88" title="1765.72" id=c_"1765.72">__May__</span> one's called Room 40 mm-hmm. <affirmative> in, in Brisbane. And he puts on a lot of really great events. He's just, he <span style="color:red" data-ts="1772.56" data-end_ts="1772.6" title="1772.56" id=c_"1772.56">__is__</span>, he's just such a great, great lover of music and I'm, yeah. I'm really, really happy that he's gonna help me put stuff out there. So I think in the next couple of weeks we'll have like the first tracks up and then, from there I think it just yeah. Keep building and start playing some shows and Sure. It's something that I really needed to do for myself. And I don't know if you maybe have a similar kind of thing when, you know, when you spend so much time working with others, making music with them, or for them, you know, helping other people make things. Sometimes you just need to sort of go back and just work on your own stuff for a little bit. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, well, certainly therapy, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>You know. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Certainly for myself, what I find is, that in addition to, to going off by myself and doing it, I have to sort of like manufacture a process that's completely unlike how I work with everyone else. Yeah. Right. Yeah. And so in my case, I went, I went full on stupid and I bought an electron Octa <span style="color:red" data-ts="1838.52" data-end_ts="1838.76" title="1838.52" id=c_"1838.52">__track__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>Wow. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So that actually, the sequencing and looping and all that stuff happens in hardware. So between that and a Boomerang looping pedal, and then my modular <laugh>, that's, that's how I do my solo stuff. And it is so different from working with Max or, you know, working, working with Ableton and working with the things that I do professionally. It's so different that it, it seems like a completely different creative endeavor. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>But, you know, I, I did exactly the same thing, and that's, I think why the, you know, the music that I ended up making has no beats on it at all. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Right, right. Because 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>It's like when I, I think I spent so much time around really heavy, heavily driven, rhythmic music that the thing that I needed to make was just totally not rhythmic at all. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Yeah. Well, that's, so it 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>A complete antithesis of everything else that I've done 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Yeah. I was gonna say that, that listening to, listening to the music that, that you were, you had sent me, I was really struck by how some of the voicing maybe was similar to what I heard in the cut copy thing, but how, first of all, the, one of the things I would say about cut copy is that a lot of times the rhythms are almost the hook, you know, and they're almost melodic Yeah. In the way that the, the rhythms work in their music. And so the complete lack of rhythm of rhythmic elements was kind of surprised me. But the other thing was I couldn't, I couldn't really make out whether you were using hardware or software or some hybrid because it had, it had some, some of the, some of the sounds were very earthy and stuff I would kind of consider to be more analog ish system, but there was also this, digital sheen of processing, which was really compelling too. And kind of the combination of the two I found I thought really worked out really nicely. So can you tell me some of how you made that? What were, what were the tools you used? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>I think, well, a lot of it for me was really open-ended experimentation. And the main things that I really used was I wanted to really simplify my music making progress. And I also didn't want to rely, like, go into it relying on any sort of one piece of technology, I guess. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, because you know, like a lot of people, and I think probably every, every person that makes music is, has this issue at some point where they say, oh, I can't possibly make this unless I have this thing <laugh> <laugh>. You know? And that's probably why, especially modular synth things have sort of really taken off because it's a never ending. Oh, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2019.31" data-end_ts="2019.6" title="2019.31" id=c_"2019.31">__sure__</span>. Sort of, it's a never ending <laugh>, kind of, life goal <laugh> Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Quest. The Quest, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>The quest. So I wanted to make a record that I could make with the things that I had with me. And when I moved to London, I really, I didn't take a lot of stuff. So I took, my modular system, which is like a three, three unit, euro rack thing. I had, Roland sh seven mm-hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>Mono phonics thing with the, where the keyboard doesn't work. Right. And Nice. And I had my computer and I, the, I think the only thing I bought for the whole record was a chaos pad. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>Which I bought because I, so I worked with a guy called Michael Rother <span style="color:red" data-ts="2061.54" data-end_ts="2061.76" title="2061.54" id=c_"2061.54">__for__</span>, who used to play in a band called noi. Yeah. And, he played in Harmonia and stuff, and I did a bunch of touring with them, and they all used these, the chaos pads. Oh man, these things sound really cool. Yeah. And sort of, it's not an instrument. It's like a weird, you know, little Fiji widge box, <laugh>, you know, mystery box. You never really know what's gonna come out of it. So that's the only thing I bought for the record. And most of the stuff I did, was in the computer, and then I'd run it out to the modular and do some things with it. Or I, I'd run it into the s <span style="color:red" data-ts="2091.64" data-end_ts="2091.8" title="2091.64" id=c_"2091.64">__sh__</span> seven and process it. But a lot of it was just, it was just pure experimentation. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>I didn't really have a, an, sort of a theory of how I wanted to do it. I just knew that I wanted to make something and I wanted to make it with the tools Right. That I had. And actually through that whole process, that's how I really got into, well, I got back into using MaxMSP and Max for live stuff and lots of granular processing and things. And it just sort of opened up this whole new world for me, which I don't think would've happened if I had everything ever in front of me to make something with. It was really good to have something that was just really inside my computer and inside my head. Right. And it didn't, and it didn't require anything else. So it just pushed me into all these really new interesting areas sonically, and I've just sort of stayed there ever since I started working on this stuff. And now it's sort of become a bit of a full-time obsession for me. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, it's interesting though, because now that you say that there are things that I heard that I, I wasn't sure what you were doing that all of a sudden just map to like a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2164.51" data-end_ts="2164.8" title="2164.51" id=c_"2164.51">__cast__</span> pad conceptually. Yeah. You know, because the one thing about the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2168.08" data-end_ts="2168.28" title="2168.08" id=c_"2168.08">__cast__</span> pad that's cool is you, can you get these, like, you can do these big like sweepy things where, you know, five or six parameters are kind of changing on the fly. Yeah. And that's, that's sort of hard to do on a computer based system. It's sort of hard to do because of the limit of arms you have. Yeah. It's kind of hard to do on a live system, but I hadn't thought about the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2190.36" data-end_ts="2190.64" title="2190.36" id=c_"2190.36">__Chaos__</span> Pad, but that makes a lot of sense. And well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>It's sort of like, yeah, it's a really, it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2195.76" data-end_ts="2195.88" title="2195.76" id=c_"2195.76">__a__</span> really express, I mean, it sounds weird to say it's a really, it's an amazingly expressive chaos machine. Yeah. And you know, like even if you just plug like a really regular kind of patch into it and play with one hand, and you're playing this thing and then you sort of find some really nice sweet spot on this thing, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2216.12" data-end_ts="2216.24" title="2216.12" id=c_"2216.12">__and__</span> you can sort of like toggle like a tiny little bit. Right. It's just all of a sudden it's something that's quite, mundane sounding turns into this really expressive thing, you know? And so a lot of the, yeah. A lot of it was sort of this <span style="color:red" data-ts="2231.87" data-end_ts="2232.16" title="2231.87" id=c_"2231.87">__play__</span>, like I'd find something, play it, run into this thing, and then I also sent Midi out of the Chaos Pad back into Ableton to sort of control parameters right. Within it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. Yeah. I think one of the things I always liked about the Chaos Pad was too, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2245.82" data-end_ts="2246.04" title="2245.82" id=c_"2245.82">__is__</span> that the way that that is, you're never going to get like completely smooth transitions. It's always going to have kind of the jerkiness or like the weird curves that come when a human is interacting with the system, rather than some pre-programmed machine movement. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>Exactly. And I think for me, not having something that was duplicatable was a really big part of it as well. And I think, you know, I I just sort of thought about this after we spoke the other night, about, you know, the way that you sort of start it, the way that you approach your shows where you, you know, you start with <span style="color:red" data-ts="2284.76" data-end_ts="2284.88" title="2284.76" id=c_"2284.76">__a__</span>, like, it kind of at 0.0 Yeah. And you build a patch as you're going and, you know, you'll probably never be able to reproduce. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh no. Absolutely 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>Not. What after, you know, from show to show, and there's something really that, you know, has maybe only recently become, sort, come back into electronic music, at least from my sort of limited, vantage point, I guess, that the, the idea of like non duplicatable digital instrument or electronic instrument is like, it's just an amazing thought to me because for so long things in electronic instrument design was all about emulation and duplicability and reliability. And you know, it's like, it was all about trying to make one thing sound like another thing. And it seems so exciting to me at the moment through my own experimentation that it's now turned into this like totally chaotic, non duplicatable kind of thing that is just, you know, seems to be infinite. Right. So it's really exciting to me 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That, yeah, I agree. Well, I, not only is it, not duplicatable, but also it's kind of got, it's almost got this steam. A lot of the new stuff kind of has this steampunk aesthetic of, you know, it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2370.2" data-end_ts="2370.44" title="2370.2" id=c_"2370.2">__going__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2370.44" data-end_ts="2370.52" title="2370.44" id=c_"2370.44">__to__</span>, it's gonna break down, but it'll break down any interesting way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b><laugh>, I think maybe that's the great, that's a really great way to sum up my record. It's a whole bunch of just, it's just like, everything is just broken, but it's all broken in a really pretty way. And it sounds great when you put it through some really nice reverb <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>So, but that's, you know, I think I can't even, I can't remember how I made half of that stuff, but it's all, yeah. It's all just broken in a really beautiful way 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Now, the other question I have, which is kind of related to what we've been talking about, 'cause we've talked a lot about you, you know, your work with a group and your work, you know, on the road. How do you, what do you, what do you do personally to sort of like stimulate creativity when you're working with this stuff as a full-time gig? I mean, you talked about it sort of in relationship to you're making your new record, but in, in the general case, whether you're going in the studio with cut copy or with other collaborators, or you're working on your own thing, how do you make it so that the fact that you do it for a living doesn't prevent you from being creative about it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2450.3" data-end_ts="2450.52" title="2450.3" id=c_"2450.3">__Ah__</span>, that's an interesting question. I, I've never really thought about it, to be honest. I think the way that I think about music and art as a full-time thing, you, I just have to try and make things as good as they can possibly be. And that's really the only thought I ever put into it, because so much of it is just down to the day that you're doing it, or the way that people are feeling, or, yeah. It's really just to make things as good as they can possibly be. And, and also to know when enough's enough, you know, because a lot of the time you can work on something forever and it doesn't get any better <laugh>, it just, it just gets worse. And so to maybe that's the thing is just to know when enough's enough and to, to know when to take a break. I rely a lot on coffee. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>There you go. That, that has a lot of kind of that driving force in my life, <laugh>. But that's, I I, I've never really put any thought into it. And maybe that's the answer to that question. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Maybe that is the answer. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>I don't, I I, I don't really try to quantify it because I think for me it's something that I, I, yeah. It's just, it's just part of who I am and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2526.39" data-end_ts="2526.47" title="2526.39" id=c_"2526.39">__how__</span>, who I've grown up. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What that also implies, you know, what that also implies is that you don't have, you don't have any trouble being creative with the people that you're collaborating with. Maybe that has a lot to do with being thoughtful about the people you're collaborating with. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>Yeah. And, and you know, and everybody has really different needs. I think there's definitely, there's definitely people that you can be a lot more. Well, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2552.79" data-end_ts="2552.91" title="2552.79" id=c_"2552.79">__I__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2552.91" data-end_ts="2553.03" title="2552.91" id=c_"2552.91">__just__</span>, yeah, it depends on how well you can read people, you know, I mean, we, you know, we were talking the other day about interviews, you know, how, how you interview people. And I think that there's, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2565.29" data-end_ts="2565.51" title="2565.29" id=c_"2565.29">__de__</span> depending on who you're speaking to, you just sort of change without really even knowing it. You just change the way that you approach things. And if you have somebody that's a little bit harder to speak to, you maybe change the way that you phrase your questions, but you don't stop the interview and, you know, stop doing it. Or maybe there's a, a person that you're teaching at university and like, everyone's just different, has a different kind of approach to life. And I think part of collaborating or working or teaching people or, you know, anything that sort of is, has, has a transfer of emotions and knowledge with it relies on being able to be a good reader of people and situations and knowing what's achievable in those situations. You know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That's a really great point. That's a really great point. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="2616.19" data-end_ts="2616.31" title="2616.19" id=c_"2616.19">__you__</span>, and you're right. I mean, one of the reasons why I don't have trouble, interviewing people regardless of where they're coming from or what their attitudes about it might be, is that I really am genuinely interested in what they have to say. Yeah. And so I think being into the thing makes it so that it's not really work, no matter how much work it might actually be. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>Yeah, absolutely. I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2642.31" data-end_ts="2642.43" title="2642.31" id=c_"2642.31">__think__</span>, and that's, that's the way I feel about it as well. Actually, we were, we're, I'm currently in a town called, St. George in Utah on a, on a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2651.75" data-end_ts="2651.95" title="2651.75" id=c_"2651.75">__st__</span> on a stop over day. And we just went and had some food, and I was talking to Dan from <span style="color:red" data-ts="2656.21" data-end_ts="2656.43" title="2656.21" id=c_"2656.21">__co__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2656.43" data-end_ts="2656.67" title="2656.43" id=c_"2656.43">__copy__</span> about this, we were talking about the concept of retirement, and I was like, man, I just, I can't even, I can't think of the idea of retirement. Right. I was like, I don't, like, I don't consider what we do as work. Right. I mean, we all like, you know, you have to, you have to generate some income so that you can live. Right. But it's not like I don't wake up in the morning and say, oh God, I've gotta go to work. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I know. And it's, or 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>So it's, it's, it's like, it's a forever thing. I don't, I don't, yeah. I don't ever see it as being a, a, a finite sort of thing. So the concept of, you know, retirement and, all that stuff is just so far from my mind. Right. Because 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's farfetched. Yeah. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>I mean, you just, you might change the way that you, the way that your life works when you hit 70 or 80 or <laugh>, you might wanna do like a few days less a week, or you might not want <laugh>, you know, you might not want to travel anymore. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I was gonna say, you're probably not gonna want to hit the road when you're 70. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>Probably don't want to live in a tour bus when I'm 70. That's true. <laugh>. But, but there's, but for me, it will never, it will never finish, you know? Right. Sorry, I don't, I don't <span style="color:red" data-ts="2736.72" data-end_ts="2736.8" title="2736.72" id=c_"2736.72">__know__</span> how we got onto retirement <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, I don't <span style="color:red" data-ts="2738.69" data-end_ts="2739.04" title="2738.69" id=c_"2738.69">__knows__</span>. I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>Forget the 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Question. That's actually kind of a cool, a cool direction because again, it is something that I think, I think the more that you're part of what is like what some people call the creative class, I think the more that you're tied into it, the less you think of there being an arc to your career. Yeah. You know, you don't really think of it because you barely are thinking about it as a career at all. <laugh>, you're thinking about it as an exciting thing I'm doing right now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And especially if you're collaborating with really good people. Oh, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>And I think that's, that's really, I mean, I've definitely worked on projects, especially as a tour manager where that hasn't been the case, where you just sort of sent out with people that you're sort of quite incompatible with <laugh> in the short term. And actually not, sort of, not touring so much for me has been one way to not, to not do that. Like, just to work on, you know, I mean, obviously there's always weird projects that you sort of do and, but for the most part, try and work on things that are really genuinely exciting. And maybe, you know, that sort of comes back to doing lots of different things for me, is that everything that I do is I try and be really new at. Right. You know, and rather than being in sort of old and jaded about it, it's just, it's just like, oh, great, I'm doing this really new exciting thing, you know, oh, I'm doing the sound design for an online Facebook game, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>Like, you know, I, I've only just gotten Facebook. So for me it's like, well, you know, it's like, it's, it's like a, you know, I probably don't want to do sound design for an online Facebook game for the rest of my life, but, you know, it's a really, it's kind of a new way of looking at stuff and new tools that I can use to do that, those kinds of things. And so I'm, yeah, I'm sort of genuinely excited about most of the things that I work on because they're new and you Yeah. Sort of come into <span style="color:red" data-ts="2862.8" data-end_ts="2862.92" title="2862.8" id=c_"2862.8">__it__</span>, that enthusiasm and actually, yeah. So to sort of stop, like, to stop that part of my life where I was working with a lot of people for the most part were really amazing people that I'm still really close friends with. But the few that it didn't sort of, I didn't click with sort of immediately, I think it was worth, worth pushing myself in a bit of a different direction. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>But I think that's why I'm like consistently excited by all the stuff that I do. And, yeah, it's, it's, yeah, <laugh>, I dunno if there's much more I can say about it, but it sort of ties, ties back into learning a lot as well. I think I've sort of, I've tried to spend <span style="color:red" data-ts="2902.1" data-end_ts="2902.32" title="2902.1" id=c_"2902.1">__for__</span> the last two years of my development, like really, trying to learn, new stuff. And I think that's actually why I started listening to your podcast because <laugh>, so I started, doing lots of development in <span style="color:red" data-ts="2914.86" data-end_ts="2915.08" title="2914.86" id=c_"2914.86">__Max__</span> just, for some people like building things for various composers and stuff. And now I'm building my own software with Max, and I'm learning, like I've gone back to university to do some parts of a computer science degree so I can get better at Java and see, to sort of build things, that work, you know, obviously very well <span style="color:red" data-ts="2935.92" data-end_ts="2936.2" title="2935.92" id=c_"2935.92">__with__</span> Inside Max. And, yeah, so try and pick up things that sort constantly push me in new, in new, new and exciting directions. And that's, yeah. So that's actually how I picked up your podcast was interesting, was like, I listen to a bunch of people that do really exciting projects and Yeah. <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's, that's awesome. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>It's just great to listen to, you know. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm glad that you, I'm glad that you, you found it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>Yeah, me too, man. It's great. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. So, I wanna get back to one more thing because I think that you, I think that you have something, and maybe you don't, maybe you've never really intellectualized it that much, but I wanna know more about how you pick your collaborations. I mean, you, you mentioned that this thing of when you got into London, you're sort of saying yes to everything, but, you know, it also sounds like you've, you know, over the years you've, you've done some either work as a term manager or work as a composer or whatever. You've worked with different people, that have kind of maybe been the whole range of likable to Dislikable 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What is it, how is it that you make your decisions about who you're going to put time in with? Because I think if, if anything, as artists, for all of us, the, the commodity that is the commodity that's definable that we put into a relationship is time. You know, creativity, you can't really predefine that, so you can't tell, or you can't say, you know, I, I don't want to, you know, I, I can't afford to waste my creativity because creativity is in a way kind of an endless well, but also it's, you know, kind of undefinable, but you can define time. Yeah. And so it seems like for artists, a lot of the measurement of, how much you like somebody or how well you get along with them or how well you collaborate is based on how much time you're willing to spend with them. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>How do you make the decisions that you do in order to put, in order to kind of dedicate the time necessary to do, to do a great job? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>That's a, that's a good question. I think, I think firstly it's, there's probably a bit of a, I guess maybe it's a bit of a default way of operating. Like you sort of, one project generally leads to another if you get along well. So if I've gotten along really well with some people, then that might lead onto something else they're sort of vaguely connected with, and it sort of follows a bit of a path of just working with people that I've gotten along well with. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3109.43" data-end_ts="3109.72" title="3109.43" id=c_"3109.43">__Sure__</span>. So I guess that's maybe the first, the first part of it. I think the, the other thing, that maybe I've never really thought that much about, but I'm, I think does play a really big part, is being really aware of where I'd like to grow as a person myself. And so if I, if I put lots of time into something, it's generally, it's generally because I'm, it's, it's something that I'd like to get better at, I guess. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>So, you know, if I'm, maybe if I like, you know, mixing a record or if I'm doing some mastering for somebody or, pre-production or, you know, whatever kind of happens it, there's generally sort of a motive from my end to be better at the thing that I'm doing. And so even if it ends up not being, you know, a huge success or there's not a huge amount of money in it, or, you know, whatever sort of normal job, motivations would be, there is the, there is still a motivation for me to get better at it and to do, to come out at the other end saying, I think I did a really good job on that and I learned a lot about this particular thing that I was doing. So it's all for me, I think it all comes back to learning and, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>Becoming a, a more well-rounded <span style="color:red" data-ts="3192.97" data-end_ts="3193.32" title="3192.97" id=c_"3192.97">__under__</span> person, you know, that operates in, in music and, and art in general. Yeah. But I think that's, that's really my main motivation is just, I mean, I've definitely done some things where the prime motivation has just been financial. Sure. And I think that we probably, we all have to do that at some point. The, I guess the best point is when it's, when it's something that's really pleasing, musically and artistically pleasing, and it has, you know, a financial backend to it as well. But that's definitely never been the main motivator for me. It's always been about doing something that's, that's really is a <laugh>. I think I like phrased it when I was a teenager as this, like, it's the theory of positive contribution. Right. You know, so it's like if you, if you contribute positively to the thing that you <span style="color:red" data-ts="3253.92" data-end_ts="3254" title="3253.92" id=c_"3253.92">__are__</span> working on in the world around you, then through the thing that I've done, I've made a, you know, a small dent in making, making it a better place to live. So yeah, maybe that's the most sort of philosophical answer I can come up with. Well, but that's, but that's, yeah. But that's really, that's really great. And, but that's really it, man. It's, it's just trying to make something good happen and, for however that can work. That's really been my, my, my main motivation. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, it's interesting because that's, a couple of weeks ago I did an interview with, Joshua Kit Clayton mm-hmm. <affirmative>, and he talked about artwork as being sort of a political act in, in a similar way where it's an opportunity to change the world. Absolutely. That, you know, you, you don't, you don't have to be a doctor without borders in order to be able to change the world positively. And I think remembering that that's something that you can do with art is a really, is a really key component to, to integrating it into kind of a holistic life, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>Yeah. I mean, for me, it's the most important thing in the world, you know, that's, it's the thing that holds humanity together and is, is the one thing that can, can really help bring people together. And I mean, I see that, you know, when I've <span style="color:red" data-ts="3337.03" data-end_ts="3337.32" title="3337.03" id=c_"3337.03">__sort__</span> of the, the times in my life where I've done a lot of touring, I can really see that in like day to day. You can see that you, you know, for this brief period of time, you're bringing all these people together for one thing. And that's, that's, it's a really, it's, it's an amazingly special thing. And I think all forms of art, like whether they're big shows or small shows or a big gallery or a small gallery or, you know, it doesn't matter how big your audience is, like even if it's an audience of one, you know, if you've, if you've, there's some connection with the, the thing that you make and that the one person that is listening to it also has with you, then that's something that wouldn't have existed beforehand without you having made it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, absolutely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>And then the more is you have, the more you succeed. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, I guess. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, well, miracle, there's a bunch of stuff I wanted to cover, but we're already out of time. <laugh>, I want to thank you so much for taking time outta your, your schedule. Glad I was able to get, get a little of your break time there in St. George. Thank you so much and I hope that you have a great rest of the tour and a great rest of the evening. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mirko: </b>Great. Thanks darling, it was great to talk to you. Bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, many thanks again to Miracle for the cool interview. It's really interesting to hear from somebody that really is out on the front lines, as well as doing a lot of other work on site. So it's cool. I saw that cut copy show. It was pretty amazing. Went with my son. We had a blast. I want to again, thank everybody for listening and thank everyone who is sharing these podcasts. We're getting great listenership and mostly I want to thank all of the people that have been willing to be interviewed for it as well. So thanks a lot and I will talk to you next week. Bye.
