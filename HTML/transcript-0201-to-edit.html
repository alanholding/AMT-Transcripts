<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, today I have a great opportunity to speak to Kim Bjørn. Kim is, probably right now most well known for the work on a newly released book. It's called Push Turn, move Interface Design and Electronic Music. It's an amazing work that talks all about how the tools that we use are developed as well as how <span style="color:red" data-ts="36.945" data-end_ts="37.165" title="36.945" id=c_"36.945">__we__</span> influence the music and how the music influences the tools and how we all influence each other. It's, it's a big book of influence. So with that, I'm gonna stop talking for a moment and, introduce you to Kim. Hey Kim. How's it going? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kim Bjørn: </b>Hi, <span style="color:red" data-ts="52.485" data-end_ts="52.925" title="52.485" id=c_"52.485">__darling__</span>. I'm fine, thanks. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thank you so much. Thank you so much for taking the time to have a discussion with me. I really appreciate it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kim: </b>You're welcome. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So why don't we start off by having you describe the book the way that you think of it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kim: </b><laugh>? Okay. Yes. The way I think of it, or have come to think of it is, you know, it's the first book of its kind, I guess. And there was nothing like that. So that's, that's, I was searching for it, you know, a book like this on interface design, in these, instruments. So basically for me, it's become like kind of, you know, I don't know what you call it, <span style="color:red" data-ts="89.085" data-end_ts="89.125" title="89.085" id=c_"89.085">__an__</span> English, but a basic book in this, area. So it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="93.365" data-end_ts="93.405" title="93.365" id=c_"93.365">__a__</span>, it, it's a textbook too, you know, though, there's a lot of pictures <laugh>. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But, hopefully it'll become some kind of a basic Go-to book, in this area. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Like an in, like an introductory text. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kim: </b>Yeah. Yeah. Though I feel that there's a lot of in-depth material too, especially because of the, all the interviews. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. And that's something that I was, I was kind of blown away with. So I got my copy of the book on Friday, and I cuddled up with it over the weekend, and I was blown away by the depth of the discussions. 'cause you talked to tons and tons of people, <laugh> people that I, you know, in many cases, people that I have interviewed, but in a lot of cases, people who I adore their work. I think it's, it's amazing. How difficult was it for you to get access to all these people and how long did it take for you to get this many interviews pulled together? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kim: </b>You know, it's taken about a year, this whole project actually. And, and some people think it's quite fast, but it's also been a very busy year, <laugh>. Right. So, and, and some, of course, some companies are small, you know, one man companies and, and some companies are very big, and it's been hard to, or taking a long time to go to get to the right people. But I think I've, I've met a lot of positivity around the project, and also a lot of interest because it's not something that they usually talk about. So, as you also say, it's, these people are, a lot of those that I also have admired through the years and seen them in videos, read their blogs online, use their products, et cetera. So, so this was <span style="color:red" data-ts="193.125" data-end_ts="193.245" title="193.125" id=c_"193.125">__a__</span>, an awesome chance to, to get to talk to them. And I, I really appreciate that they, they wanted to do this. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I think that it's really interesting that some of the people that you talk to, like Axel Hartman, for example, or Brian Crabtree, are really focused on the design side of things. But other people, like, I don't know Richard, Richard Dev Divine <span style="color:red" data-ts="215.865" data-end_ts="216.085" title="215.865" id=c_"215.865">__Say__</span>, or Susan Ani <span style="color:red" data-ts="217.425" data-end_ts="217.645" title="217.425" id=c_"217.425">__are__</span> initially, I just think of them as users of the systems. But then when you hear them describe, you know, their vision and their use of the thing, it's clear that, that they have a real design sense about how they put together their interaction with the tools as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kim: </b>Yeah. I, I think for me, that's one of the really interesting things about this book, that it's, everybody's talking about the conversation, this con conversational act, when performing or using the instruments, but also the makers are using those words. But also, I mean, the, the diversity in the, the interviews is also to kind of cast a light on these different ways of, of seeing and, and using the instruments. So it's not only makers, it's also artists or makers that have, have been artists or artists that are now makers, actually. Right. So that's quite interesting, I think. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now this book was originally funded through a Kickstarter, right? Yeah. And it's a beautiful publication. Is this now it says it's published by 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kim: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="280.505" data-end_ts="280.725" title="280.505" id=c_"280.505">__Bs__</span>. Yeah. <laugh>. bs. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. So is that, is that your publishing company or is part of this <span style="color:red" data-ts="285.965" data-end_ts="286.205" title="285.965" id=c_"285.965">__having__</span> to make a publishing company for your own book? Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kim: </b>It actually, it, it became that way because of various reasons. I'm a designer myself, so I designed the whole book actually. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And of course it was quite a work also writing it and conducting all the interviews. But, but I mean, this is, this is a dream come true for me. So this is also what I want to do. And I find that there's quite a lot of interest in books now, actually. It's, it's a bit interesting. So, so I made the publishing company and I also count on doing, you know, client publishing and stuff like that. So I think we found a really good area here that I really want to dive more into, and for certain we have more ideas coming. Actually, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's interesting that you say that you're seeing a renewed interest in books. It seems like there are a lot of technologies that we threw away because we thought digital would be better, and now we're going back to them, not necessarily because they're more convenient, but because they're more enjoyable. I think of like vinyl as an example. <span style="color:red" data-ts="348.305" data-end_ts="348.525" title="348.305" id=c_"348.305">__Mm__</span>. Analog synthesizers as an example. You know, you bring up this idea of books as an example, but even things like notebooks, you know, the resurgence of just having a paper notebook for keeping their notes. I mean, all of these things kind of give us a nod to the fact that sometimes the most efficient mechanism for distribution <laugh> isn't necessarily the one we love using. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kim: </b>Exactly. I mean, I have it the same way with my music library. You know, I have a lot of, you know, online music access, but I don't use it. I use the <span style="color:red" data-ts="383.005" data-end_ts="383.245" title="383.005" id=c_"383.005">__hard__</span> copy stuff I have, you know, and it's like the instruments, you're perfectly right about that. And it's, it's really interesting to see how the companies and the people in, in involved in this book, like was, you know, wow, it's going to be a book. Right. It's quite something special, I think. And also the last couple of weeks we've seen so many images on Instagram and Facebook of people unwrapping their books and, and you know, sharing the joy of that, you know, smelling the book <laugh>, right. Newly printed and stuff like that. It's awesome. I mean, it's, it's, it's so great to see. The, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The other side of it too is what you did was kind of a thing of beauty rather than, I almost hesitate to to call it like self-publish, because it doesn't have any of the hallmarks of that. The typography is gorgeous. The binding is beautiful. All of the design work. I mean, clearly, if, if nothing else, this is going to end up being a great calling card for you as a designer. 'cause it's gorgeous 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kim: </b><laugh>. Thanks. Yeah, I mean, I've, of course, I'm, I'm really into details. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So this has also been, I've been publishing books before, but I've always had a publisher. So this was, you know, also my chance to, to do it like I wanted it. That's also the reason we did a Kickstarter. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="457.045" data-end_ts="457.205" title="457.045" id=c_"457.045">__that__</span>, that Kickstarter was not only successful, but it was like crazy successful, as I recall, <laugh>, you, you, it far outstripped what you expected, initially, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kim: </b>Yeah, definitely. I mean, we, we got funded within like, I think 45 minutes or so. I think we got to 1200% funding. That was, amazing. I mean, that's, and that, that was really nice to see that there actually was this interest. It was not just me <laugh> that wanted this book. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's, that's really, that's really great. Now the other thing is, is in order to, in order for this book to really success be successful, you needed to not only speak the language of design, but you also had to speak the language of electronic music. What kind of work do you do in the musical world that makes this an area of comfort for you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kim: </b>I can start when I, like 30 years ago I had to, to choose a career, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="510.685" data-end_ts="511.165" title="510.685" id=c_"510.685">__there's__</span>, there's not much money in music <laugh>. Right. At least not in Denmark. So, so, <span style="color:red" data-ts="515.725" data-end_ts="515.885" title="515.725" id=c_"515.725">__you__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="515.885" data-end_ts="516.045" title="515.885" id=c_"515.885">__know__</span>, I chose the, the design career, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="518.245" data-end_ts="518.365" title="518.245" id=c_"518.245">__I__</span>, I'm, I'm quite fond of that, but I always played music in my, my spare time. Played in, you know, youth bands and stuff like that. So I've been playing music all the time. And I think it's around 10 years ago, I really started to take it seriously. And, I used it a lot as a kind of relaxation or, you know, as a, of course, as a hobby, but also, you know, just chilling out with my instruments and with the software. Started out with logic and yeah, that was what I could afford at that time, <laugh>. So, I played ambient music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kim: </b>That was how it came to be. Like for now, I think 10, 9, 10 years. And I play regularly in the, actually in the Cathedral of Copenhagen. I have a, like a, a show once a month, a three hour live, performance there. Wow. Once in a while I play with other people, like I perform with Chrysler at the Danish <span style="color:red" data-ts="573.915" data-end_ts="574.205" title="573.915" id=c_"573.915">__Club__</span> Festival a few years ago. And, that was really fun actually. And also play with the violinist and <span style="color:red" data-ts="580.445" data-end_ts="580.605" title="580.445" id=c_"580.445">__the__</span> guitarist and, and other people. So I'm enjoying that. So I've always, you know, explored, and have this interest in, in the instruments, hardware or software. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What kind of music do you feel like is your real voice? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kim: </b>Yeah, you know, that's probably changes over time, but the last, I mean, the last seven years, it's really been ambient, deep ambient, as I call it. It actually, my project name for that was Dream Hub, like a hub for dreams. You know, so, and, and the idea for that was actually to, again, to share kind of the same philosophy with <span style="color:red" data-ts="616.265" data-end_ts="616.485" title="616.265" id=c_"616.265">__fi__</span> with the book actually, to share, common, you know, dreams actually. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, and, and provide a space, sound space for that. So it's very mu much in, in sound structures, soundscapes and kind of very droning stuff also. That's, that's what I've enjoyed so far. But I'm also exploring other areas of minimal kind of techno stuff, but that's, that's only in <span style="color:red" data-ts="641.365" data-end_ts="641.445" title="641.365" id=c_"641.365">__a__</span> hobby since. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So I'm curious, now, you have this job as a designer, which you've been doing for 30 years, but you've also mentioned, you know, doing books as well as doing this book and feeling comfortable enough to become a publisher. But you're also a longtime musician. What is your background? What, where are you coming from? What, what, what is your beginning story? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kim: </b><laugh>? My beginning story? Yeah. That's actually, I think it's as many else, in, in this world. You know, discovering the sound at some point, this new, synthesizer sound in the seventies. That's, when I discovered, Jean <span style="color:red" data-ts="684.205" data-end_ts="684.485" title="684.205" id=c_"684.205">__Michel__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="684.515" data-end_ts="684.805" title="684.515" id=c_"684.515">__Shah__</span>, as a lot of other people <laugh> did or other, electronic acts at that time, and kind of getting this interested for interesting new sound. And then, you know, going down to the local music shop, checking out stuff and taking it from there. I, I have a background in also being trained in, in classical piano and also studied some film composing. But, but that was, was a career I didn't kind of wanted to follow. Although I've actually helped out on a, on at least one <laugh> Hollywood movie, actually, where I prepared some sheet music and stuff that was fun. But basically it was from the, the technological side, I think, you know, the curiosity of what does, what happens if I turn this knob? And I think we can all relate to that curiosity. Sure. The technology. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, but it sounds like you actually had kind of the, the background where you, you might've been able to, you know, scrape together a career in music. Is it just something where you looked at it and it seemed either, did it seem too like difficult or did it seem like it would take you in the wrong direction? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kim: </b>I think it, to me, it, it was, it seemed a bit too difficult, and I'm not trained really that much, so I, I saw a lot of people much, much better than me doing, like film music, for example. And it takes a lot in that business. And it's a, it's a tough business. I mean, <span style="color:red" data-ts="770.065" data-end_ts="770.285" title="770.065" id=c_"770.065">__and__</span> basically I found out that at some point what I wanted to do with music was actually just to, to relax. I didn't want it to be a new job, <laugh>. Right. Over time, it has, it has been a kind of a new job, but it's a, a job that <laugh> enjoy anyway, doing it my own way. And that's exactly what I'm doing with this book, actually. It's a job for me to do this book, but I enjoy it because I'm a hundred percent in charge also, I thought in the beginning, <laugh>. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, so the forward for the book is from Jean-Michel <span style="color:red" data-ts="799.445" data-end_ts="799.805" title="799.445" id=c_"799.445">__Sherry__</span>. I was interested in it, and then you'd now talk about how he was so influential on you. What was it like for you to actually have a, have that discussion with him, interact with him on the foreword for your book? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kim: </b>I mean, that was kind of, you know, like the, the, the 15 minutes that you, you will never forget, but also that you, you afterwards, you what happened, you know, <laugh>. Right. But, it, it was amazing. And I was really, really happy that he found this interest in the project. I mean, I, I just got the <span style="color:red" data-ts="834.045" data-end_ts="834.205" title="834.045" id=c_"834.045">__mess__</span>. I got the message, you know, one week before I could meet him, he was in Copenhagen to play, and that's actually a year ago now. And then I had this 15 minutes with him just, before the soundcheck, I think it was Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and showed him some layouts. And we discussed the, the scope of the book, and, and he could see, as he said, at least, that it, it looked like a really professional project and that really wanted to, to support. So that was, that was just amazing for me. It was like, you know, going full circle <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Did you have much trouble convincing people that this was going to be professionally done? Because I think, you know, one of the, one of the concerns for people had to be putting their name on something that might have been a bit of a train wreck. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kim: </b>Yeah. And I think that happens probably to a lot of people. And of course, you want, as <span style="color:red" data-ts="884.165" data-end_ts="884.285" title="884.165" id=c_"884.165">__a__</span>, you want to know what you put your name on. So, so it, I did a lot of, layouts for him to, to see that it was actually a very good, quality. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So I think I worked that week for like 24 hours a day, <laugh>. Right. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Throughout the book, you, you do have these great interviews with people of, of all of them who gave you the most surprising. I mean, this is a way for me to like jump to the meaty parts of the book <laugh>, who gave you <laugh> who gave you like, the most surprising answers or the most surprising results when you talk to them? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kim: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="921.835" data-end_ts="921.955" title="921.835" id=c_"921.835">__Hmm__</span>. Oh, wow. That's a real difficult question. Because there are so many interesting answers or, or suggestions. I mean, I think actually the most interesting thing actually was that to learn how much these people think about what they're doing. It's not just, you know, I want to do an instrument and I want to do it this way. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, there are, there's a deeper philosophy behind it. And I, and I, I enjoyed a lot of the, the talks, I mean, <span style="color:red" data-ts="950.965" data-end_ts="951.315" title="950.965" id=c_"950.965">__touch__</span> from, from <span style="color:red" data-ts="951.945" data-end_ts="952.235" title="951.945" id=c_"951.945">__Coke__</span>, when he was there, who did the, the ULCA and, and all these, you know, afford affordable instruments. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> that philosophy behind that, <span style="color:red" data-ts="960.715" data-end_ts="960.915" title="960.715" id=c_"960.715">__the__</span>, the, the democratization of, of instruments. I really enjoyed that view on it. And I also actually liked, to talk to, Mr. <span style="color:red" data-ts="971.105" data-end_ts="971.395" title="971.105" id=c_"971.105">__Kita__</span>, the designer of the, the Yamaha DX seven. Right. Because that's, that's a really yelled at <laugh> synthesizer. I mean, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kim: </b>So, so, and that's exactly, like, that's exactly the reason I wanted it, because it, and what I really, like to, to, to put emphasis on here is that it's, in this case it was also a design statement for them to do. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, and of course there's all sorts of stuff going into the design of an instrument, but, it was very much a, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1003.315" data-end_ts="1003.435" title="1003.315" id=c_"1003.315">__a__</span>, a statement also. And I think there's, there's so many ways you can approach the design of an instrument, and that's actually what makes it so interesting. And that's also why I, I mean, the, the number of interviews grew from, I, I had planned 25, and now there's 45 interviews in the 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Book. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kim: </b>Man. So, yeah. Unreal. But, but I, but I really enjoyed them. I mean, it's, it's really hard to to say which are the, the most interesting, but I, I mean also <span style="color:red" data-ts="1032.655" data-end_ts="1032.875" title="1032.655" id=c_"1032.655">__the__</span>, the interview will make noise. Tony Orlando is, is really interesting. I think, the way he also talks about also that maybe instruments should not always be easy to learn. Maybe it's okay that they are hard to learn, actually, because it gives you some kind of a reward. And, and actually some makers are talking about this philosophy, and I kind of like it also. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That's, that's an interesting point. Well, also, if it's a little hard to learn, it leaves the opportunity to, for people to find their own way to use an instrument, I think of like a, like a guitar, right? A guitar is a peculiar instrument and there is, you know, kind of a standard way of playing, but it's got enough flexibility so that, you know, I recently interviewed some people that were involved in touch guitar where you're playing both hands up on the neck, and it was never meant to be played that way, but they were able to take this very flexible interface and find a different way to use it. Right. Mm-Hmm. But I think, I'm glad you pointed out the, the interview with Yahiro, about the DX seven. It's the one I hadn't read yet. It's an interesting thing to think about the design, you know, about the DX seven as a design choice. I think now, you know, people look back <span style="color:red" data-ts="1107.605" data-end_ts="1107.765" title="1107.605" id=c_"1107.605">__at__</span> it, it's like, how could you go from having all these knobs to having nothing? Right? Mm-Hmm. Yeah. But I remember when I fir when it first came out, it, in comparison to like a prophet five, it looked so sleek and so modern, which kind of matched the sound that it made. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kim: </b>I mean, it's, it's probably also, it is kind of the same philosophy you have today now with like, companies like <span style="color:red" data-ts="1131.985" data-end_ts="1132.405" title="1131.985" id=c_"1131.985">__Rollie__</span> doing the, the blocks, right. And then you have still a lot of like the Smith synthesizer. I mean, you have both ends of the spectrum, right. And, and I mean, something can be termed as a blank slate and the other can too. Right. 'cause they can do almost anything. And I think that's really interesting. And it's also, you know, the fact that some people really find an iPad creative and interesting and others don't. Right. That's just how the way it is, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Now, one of the interviews that I really, got off on was your interview with er Heckman from <span style="color:red" data-ts="1168.705" data-end_ts="1168.925" title="1168.705" id=c_"1168.705">__UI__</span> Software. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> talking about ergonomics in the context of making plugins, which is another one of those things. It's when you think about design, you immediately jump to thinking about hardware. But in a way, it's probably even more important to think about it in terms of software because your, the avenues you have to interface with it are so limited. You can't reach your hand across and turn four knobs or whatever everything's done with a mouse pointer. And that makes things a lot more difficult. And I thought it was really interesting in his case, him talking about the different ways to provide accessibility to a variety of options. But just to think of ergonomics in software design, I thought was, was a really neat, neat approach when it was butted up against all these other people talking about hardware. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kim: </b>Exactly. And I mean, that's the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1223.245" data-end_ts="1223.405" title="1223.245" id=c_"1223.245">__really__</span> interesting thing here that, I come from basically a software background, and that's what I teach also, you know, interaction design in software, basically. So applying it to, to the hardware part is actually, as I see it a bit new, some of the concepts that I applied to hardware, hardware in the book at least. But, but also because you, when you're working with software, you are so, it's so detailed because you have only the mouse on, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1248.625" data-end_ts="1248.845" title="1248.625" id=c_"1248.625">__on__</span> nowadays, also the finger as, as the touch point. You only have limited space when you have software. You only have one screen or one window open at a time, maybe. And you have to put a lot of stuff into it on a hardware. You actually also have limited space, but in a, in another way. That's really interesting. And I think that what Axel Hartman said in, in his interview was also that when you have a hardware device, when you turn it off, it's still there. You can still look at it and, you know, see it and say, okay, I paid this and that for, for it. And I, and I really like just watching it, you know? Right. Soft software's gone. The, the, the minute you close down the screen or you open YouTube instead. I mean, so I think it's, it's a really interesting thing also related to value, the value of things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That made me think of the, the interview with Ernst, the CEO from Yes. Who talks about sort of the metaphor of hardware and kind of the sense that making things seem like hardware actually makes them seem like they have more value. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kim: </b>But also it, it made sense in the beginning, as, as they also said, the musicians at that time only knew hardware, so it made sense to make it look like hardware. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And there's, there's a lot of this, where I touch upon the geomorphic, approach in designing, because nowadays we also see a lot of this, what was previously termed as flat design. Yeah. And I think it's, it's interesting. And I really like both actually <laugh>, and in some points at INS Morphic design, you can actually make the interface more complicated than necessary, but for some users it's more, it feels more safe maybe because it feels familiar. It, and it, oh, this is <span style="color:red" data-ts="1356.915" data-end_ts="1357.205" title="1356.915" id=c_"1356.915">__knop__</span>, you know, you can see that it's a knob because you know it from the hardware device. So it makes it easier to use <span style="color:red" data-ts="1363.865" data-end_ts="1364.085" title="1363.865" id=c_"1363.865">__or__</span> approach at least. Right. So there are these different, again, approaches, but, but I think, you know, making it look like hardware is interesting, but also sometimes maybe a bit unnecessary for some products. But I mean, for Propellerhead, for reason, it has always been like that. And I, I don't think they will ever change, and I don't think they should actually. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, conversely, it's hard to imagine like Ableton doing something that would have wood panel, you know, fake wood panels on it. Right. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kim: </b><laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I guess there they're <span style="color:red" data-ts="1395.085" data-end_ts="1395.285" title="1395.085" id=c_"1395.085">__their__</span> styles related to their self identity. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kim: </b>Definitely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So one of the other things that I really liked was, some of the discussions you had with people about their use of tools, not just the creation of them. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, and I'm thinking like the interview with, Ian Golden from DJ Tech Tools, or with Laura Esade, who's a very active performer and a stage performer. Right. It was really interesting to hear them talk about the tools kind of, of in a completely different way, because a, a big part of what they do is sort of like, make choices based on the tools that they're comfortable using. They make artistic choices. And, you know, in court case of Laura, she's, she's having to, you know, she's having to use tools that are very much easily adapted to her way of, of thinking about things, which is kind of, it, it has to provide a really difficult landscape for designers, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kim: </b>Yeah, definitely. You, you, I think, what also <span style="color:red" data-ts="1458.365" data-end_ts="1458.605" title="1458.365" id=c_"1458.365">__shows__</span> some of the interviews that some of the designers are thinking of, you know, providing a lot of options for the artists or the users as I call them. But also some have to think about, what do I have to leave out? Because that's the most important. And I think that's, that's some of the choices that users or artists really have to take in, especially in, in maybe stressed <span style="color:red" data-ts="1480.785" data-end_ts="1481.005" title="1480.785" id=c_"1480.785">__the__</span> live performance situations. So that's, that's really interesting. But also the, on the other, on the contrary, you have, a guy like Larry <span style="color:red" data-ts="1490.125" data-end_ts="1490.405" title="1490.125" id=c_"1490.125">__Hurt__</span>, for example, who produced beautiful house music for, for decades. I mean, he says, you know, there was this drum machine and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1499.725" data-end_ts="1499.845" title="1499.725" id=c_"1499.725">__I__</span> just <span style="color:red" data-ts="1500.005" data-end_ts="1500.285" title="1500.005" id=c_"1500.005">__learned__</span>, you know, what was there and used it like it was, and that's one approach to, to take what's there and just to get the best out of it. And the other approach is, you know, as Ian talks about to start, altering it or sashing it up, and tear apart and put it together in new ways. Right. So I find those approaches, really interesting also. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. It points out that, that sometimes we can be a little bit naive about what we think are valuable designs. I mean, it's sometimes if, if you don't really know what you want to do, the seems to be having controls for everything, because then no matter what I want to do, the control will be there to do it. Right? Yeah, exactly. But, you know, if you take something like a TR 9 0 9 drum machine, it is what it is. And if it fits your needs, the, the having controls that are all very conducive to artistic use of that tool is really the most sensible interface of all. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kim: </b>Exactly. I mean, that's, that's actually the reason I recently sold my OC <span style="color:red" data-ts="1569.965" data-end_ts="1570.245" title="1569.965" id=c_"1569.965">__track__</span> <laugh>, ah, and, and, and bought the Dig <span style="color:red" data-ts="1572.745" data-end_ts="1572.965" title="1572.745" id=c_"1572.745">__act__</span>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1573.425" data-end_ts="1573.645" title="1573.425" id=c_"1573.425">__And__</span> I found that I only used some parts of the instrument, though I loved it. But, and those parts I used, they were in the dig <span style="color:red" data-ts="1579.825" data-end_ts="1580.045" title="1579.825" id=c_"1579.825">__act__</span>. So I, I, that was what I went for. And I think that's, that's what you find sometimes that, that you only go so far with an instrument, and especially if you have many instruments. I mean, it takes time to go really into depth with them all. You know, if you provide massive opportunities for new users or not very skilled users, beginners, then it's of course it's too much. So, so there's this learning curve everybody's talking about, right. Where, and I think that's really what, what you have to think about when you design instruments that you, how can you keep the user's curiosity and still provide them, with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1619.765" data-end_ts="1619.965" title="1619.765" id=c_"1619.765">__the__</span>, an environment that they feel they can feel calm in actually and, and get to this flow state, right. So they don't get frustrated or worry, or maybe if they're very skilled, not get bored. Actually, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I think that's a great point because lately I've been hearing a lot of people, people who are very influential in the development of electronic music tools. I've heard a lot of them talking about, you know, there that there is, there are so many more people that want to do music that can't. And if we could only provide them tools that were easy enough to use, they could become electronic musicians. But my fear is that that does not leave the door open necessarily for people who become skilled and want to expand beyond what the tools simply provides. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kim: </b>Yeah, I think that's, that's a very good point. It's exactly the same as the desktop publishing revolution. I mean, in, in like in the eighties, like everybody got the tools to publish stuff, but it didn't look good <laugh>. So, and I mean, I, I think it's, it's a matter of time, but I think it's very much in the culture now that we are so used to getting everything immediately and getting immediate results and getting immediate news, for example. So, so users expect stuff to be easy today, at least, new users. And I think it's, it's really a balance to find out where, where you want to go as a, an instrument designer, I think. But I think, you know, devices like the, the Cork <span style="color:red" data-ts="1721.685" data-end_ts="1721.845" title="1721.685" id=c_"1721.685">__cus__</span> for example, or, or let's say the, the Make Noise <span style="color:red" data-ts="1725.945" data-end_ts="1726.165" title="1725.945" id=c_"1725.945">__Oak__</span> Coast or No Coast, it's a good introductory tool for a lot of people. And I mean, if, if they can, if they find joy in it and they can go from there and they want to learn more, then I think it's a good thing. We have cheaper instruments and more easy to learn instruments actually. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But I think also on the other hand, we see a lot of users, I mean, we prob you probably tried it to install <span style="color:red" data-ts="1748.005" data-end_ts="1748.125" title="1748.005" id=c_"1748.005">__a__</span> new music apps on your phone or your iPad and then never use them again. <laugh>, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I, I unfortunately have, it makes me sad when I look at my list of iOS applications that I've bought. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> most of them don't make it to the end of the day, unfortunately. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kim: </b>Exactly. Yeah, exactly. It's about getting rewards when you use them. Right. I think that's really interesting. Also, what I talk a little about in, in the book is this, the new, the different levels of attachment to an instrument. You know, where you, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I was just gonna ask you about that. I, I haven't gotten to that yet, but I was going to ask you about it because one of the things that you've taken on here Mm-Hmm. Is I think peculiar, which is in talking about instrument design, what you're actually having to do is talk about design of an item that requires commitment, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And so <span style="color:red" data-ts="1803.135" data-end_ts="1803.485" title="1803.135" id=c_"1803.135">__makes__</span> sense. Some of this belongs, you know, you ha you describe it as having a reward, you know, when you use it, you're rewarded for the use, right? Mm-Hmm. But there also has, I mean, there are other parts of a, of an instrument's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1815.765" data-end_ts="1816.125" title="1815.765" id=c_"1815.765">__design__</span> that kind of help provide support for that kind of commitment, right. Because any instrument you have to, you know, unless it's a very simple instrument, you have to commit time in order to get the best value out of it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kim: </b>Of course. But I mean, yeah. In the book I have like, six blocks, like in two models, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1836.645" data-end_ts="1836.845" title="1836.645" id=c_"1836.645">__where__</span> the first is very task oriented and very objective instrument has to be functional and has to be reliable. Right? That means function all the time, <laugh>. Yeah. Yeah. And then it of course has to be, have some level of usability, right? And if you get behind that, then you get into the experience area where you, you can start to talk about how, how do you shape the experience for the user? How can you try to shape the experience for the user, right? I use, some different models here and, and talking about this, enjoyment that we preferably should get from using an instrument. I mean, we see it a lot on the internet nowadays when, when belonging to a specific like Facebook group, like a modular group, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1877.725" data-end_ts="1878.005" title="1877.725" id=c_"1877.725">__<inaudible>__</span> group, or, you know, it could be the, cork monologue Facebook group, something like that, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kim: </b>Sure. And then you can discuss and share knowledge and, and it gives some kind of satisfaction. And, and we are not always, as human beings, you know, conscious about this, but it happens. And, it is something that really is interesting, and I think it's actually very obvious in the musical world that people really like to have opinions about stuff. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I think that's a good thing because we can share a lot of opinions, but sometimes, what I try to do actually with the book is not to specifically share my own opinion, but to provide a kind of framework to people to, to make their own opinion of this. Right. And that's why I also go into the maybe a bit, you know, dangerous territory about talking about <span style="color:red" data-ts="1927.905" data-end_ts="1928.125" title="1927.905" id=c_"1927.905">__the__</span> meaningfulness and creativity, right. And also trust and loyalty in instruments. I mean, but I think it, it, it happens a lot that we see instruments that people have used time and time again, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1939.945" data-end_ts="1940.165" title="1939.945" id=c_"1939.945">__we__</span> speak of them like friends, right? So that's, I think we all know that kind of feeling. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So as a designer yourself, you had a chance here to talk to a lot of people that had, I mean, if nothing else, everybody you interviewed had some kind of opinion about design, right? <laugh>. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah. So you got to, you got a chance to hear a lot of opinions. Mm-Hmm. How did you find it affecting your own ideas as a designer? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kim: </b>Yeah, that's interesting actually. I've not been thinking about that consciously, I think, but the thing that became very obvious for me by getting all these interviews and collect them was really that people first put a lot of effort into this. And when the work gets out there, you can risk that it gets really bad reviews or people almost yell at the instrument <laugh> and, and, don't consider that people have worked a very long time and, put a lot of effort into, to providing a good instrument for, for other people to use. And so I think this, this value you put into what you do, you can't do this without really having your heart into it, really have the passion for it. I don't know if this makes sense, but I mean, for me it was, it was obvious to me that having the idea is not enough, of course, but you have to, and, and trying to execute the idea is not even enough, but you have to execute it according to your philosophy, otherwise it simply won't work. And then you can't kind of, quote unquote defend it. Does that make sense? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, it does. And I hadn't really thought about it that way, but before the decision has to come to philosophy, that's really, yeah. That's a, that's a really neat way of, of framing it. One of the things that you kind of see when you go through your book, and, and again, I haven't read it, I, I've been jumping all around, it's a book that kind of is like, it rewards just kind of like cracking it open and seeing where you land, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kim: </b>Yeah. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But, one of the things that I've noticed is that, you know, there are designs that are current, there are some that are older, there are some that already are looking dated or whatever. Mm-Hmm. Given that people put their passion and their kind of philosophy at stake when they did these designs, how do you think that that stuff really survives with the change in perspective on design over time? I mean, when the Jupiter eight was first put out, nobody was thinking of a software emulation that would put it on the screen, nor was ever, anyone considering that, Ooh, flat design might make that look too dated or something. Right. <laugh>. What, how do you think that the, that future design trends might end up treating current instrument design, either for the good or for Ill? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kim: </b>Ooh, that's a tough question, but I, my guess is that we, we will see even more diversity, but we will also see more business oriented design. You know, when you design a website today, for example, you do a lot of usage testing. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, hopefully, and we see more and more usage testing of instruments, but I mean, we also see instruments, again, from makers in their own workshop that are made because the maker really believes it should look like that. And I think this, again, we have both ends, and I think that's a really an advantage. But I think we will see a very big difference in instruments in the future, of course, because now we are returning, or we have maybe never really left hardware, but we are also merging it now with like, augmented reality and, and, and hybrids and, and all sorts of stuff. That 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Actually brings up a, an interesting question, which is, given some of the upcoming technological options, you know, I mean, VR is the one that everyone's talking about now, but ar maybe makes more sense. Augmented reality maybe makes a little more sense. How do these things end up affecting, affecting design, you know, especially interface design or instrument design, you know, because if you think about it, one of the big tenets of why the DX seven looked the way it was, is because they wanted to hit a low price point and they wanted to use pervasively digital circuitry, right? So those things led to some of the decisions that were made there. I mean, when, when it comes time that, you know, an interface for a, for a synthesizer is all based, you know, based off of something inside of a VR headset, are we gonna end up getting a bunch of black square boxes again? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kim: </b>Mm-Hmm, <affirmative>, that's a good question. I think, I mean, today, you know, software and doing also the internal computing stuff in, in hardware synthesizers, it's, it's gotten so cheap, relatively speaking, so that you have to put a lot more effort into the outside of the instrument, a bit like <span style="color:red" data-ts="2251.705" data-end_ts="2251.925" title="2251.705" id=c_"2251.705">__Don__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2251.925" data-end_ts="2252.365" title="2251.925" id=c_"2251.925">__Bookless__</span> philosophy, like designing it from the inside <span style="color:red" data-ts="2255.105" data-end_ts="2255.325" title="2255.105" id=c_"2255.105">__or__</span> from the outside in. Right. If that makes sense. So I, I think that, that we will also see, again, like we discussed, that people really demands things that are easy to use. So I think that even if it's virtual reality or if it's a new hardware synthesizer, I mean, it'll only survive if it's easy to approach and then rewarding to use in the long run. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I think that's, that's why people are still talking about, I mean, the Yammer has CS 80, I mean, it's, it was rewarding to use, I mean, <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kim: </b>So, and then the sound was so iconic on the first Bladerunner, and actually I got a, I got a message from, Han <span style="color:red" data-ts="2294.925" data-end_ts="2295.165" title="2294.925" id=c_"2294.925">__Sima__</span>, who, who said he actually, how much he liked using it in comparison to using the mouse, and the screen. And I mean, that's, that's the rewarding thing that people will kind of remember and, and pull out again. I mean, that's the same with the minimoog, the minio, sorry, <laugh>. It's very rewarding to use and it's very immediate and people love it, for, for that reason. But of, of course also because of the sound, but very much also because of the interface. So, and now you see like Roland doing the boutique stuff that's pure nostalgia, but it's also very much a part of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2331.845" data-end_ts="2332.045" title="2331.845" id=c_"2331.845">__their__</span> philosophy of not, of not replicating the past, you know, just one-to-one, but actually Exactly. Right. So that's what I think is interesting. And then again, you see a lot of people yelling at Rodan because, they want the old stuff <laugh>, so 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's true. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kim: </b>So you can, you can make everybody satisfied, I guess. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well that's, that is most certainly true. Unfortunately, our time is already up. But before we go, I have one last question. I guess you have gotten a chance to, to go into depth on interface design, on instrument design, talking to instrument users and makers and and designers. Did it end up making you want to develop your own music instrument, or did it make you wanna run away from it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kim: </b><laugh>, I've always wanted to do instrument designs. I've, I've done a lot of sketches and stuff, but I really like to analyze stuff also. And I really like to, to talk to people about it. I mean, the conversation around it is really interesting, but it, it certainly didn't make me run away. No <laugh> good. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well Kim, I want to thank you so much for your time. And again, I want to thank you for your work on putting this, this book together, push, turn, move, interface design and electronic music. It's an amazing piece of work. I think it's something that's going to be a, a reference piece for a long, long amount of time. So thank you so much for that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kim: </b>Thank you. And thanks for having me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright, well with that, I'll let you go. Have the rest of your day. Thank you so much. And goodbye now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kim: </b>Bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, many thanks to Kim for having the chat. It was really great. Remember that if you want to copy the book now, you can jump over to push turn, move.com. There you can have access to where to buy it, where to find resellers that might carry it in your area or just kind of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2452.645" data-end_ts="2452.965" title="2452.645" id=c_"2452.645">__prune__</span> a little bit to see what it's all about. Thank you again, all the listeners for listening in. I really appreciate it and we'll catch you next week. Bye.
