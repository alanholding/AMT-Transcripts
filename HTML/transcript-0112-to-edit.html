<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. This week, I have the pleasure of talking to somebody that I run into a lot at trade shows, and I've traded emails with a couple of times, but, I will learn a lot in this interview. So, if you know the music industry at all, you know the name Gino Robert, and that's who we're talking to today. So, with that, I say hi to Gino. Hi, Gino. How are you? Good, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino Robair: </b>Darwin Thank you for, calling. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's my pleasure, really. I, you know, we don't get a chance to talk that much at trade shows because you're constantly on the sprint. Right. <laugh>. And, and then, you know, we've talked over, over the years, occasionally via email, just, in relationship to your work with various magazines. Now you're kind of in a bit of transition, or you maybe have just finished up a transition. Can you kind of tell us what your magazine roles are right now? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>Well, currently I'm the editor <span style="color:red" data-ts="68.105" data-end_ts="68.325" title="68.105" id=c_"68.105">__in__</span> chief at Keyboard Magazine. But I'm, I remain the, technical editor at Electronic Musician, which means for that magazine I handle, you know, I, I assign reviews, assign technical articles, you know, that kind of thing. So, it's sort of like a magazine and a half Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Worth 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="88.125" data-end_ts="88.245" title="88.125" id=c_"88.125">__Of__</span> work. Yeah. But, you know, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="91.565" data-end_ts="91.685" title="91.565" id=c_"91.565">__open__</span>, when the opening to keyboard came up, I was very excited because, I was, I was the editor <span style="color:red" data-ts="96.425" data-end_ts="96.645" title="96.425" id=c_"96.425">__in__</span> chief at, electronic Musician Magazine when the company was owned by, when the magazine's owned by a different company. Right. And then they decided to lay everybody off. So I was a freelancer for a long time. So I'm happy to be, you know, be in charge. Full charge of a magazine again, feels really good in terms of, you know, when you have to have a day job. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's a nice day 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>Job <span style="color:red" data-ts="116.825" data-end_ts="117.045" title="116.825" id=c_"116.825">__to__</span> have control over <laugh>. Yeah, exactly. You know, and it, it, like you mentioned in the intro, it, it helps me keep up with technologies that are, you know, interest, interesting to me as a musician, as a com a composer, because I get to meet the designers, meet the, technical staff of the different companies, and see what they're working on, ask 'em questions, provide feedback. So I find that, you know, that's kind of, for me, one of the perks of the job is to be able to, you know, be involved at that level. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Absolutely. Now, I have, I have had the, pleasure of following you on Facebook. So I kind of have, a pretty good grasp on what you do as an artist. But why don't you, explain to the listeners what your musical work is, is about? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>My life's focus, is about improvisation, improvisation, <span style="color:red" data-ts="172.355" data-end_ts="172.575" title="172.355" id=c_"172.355">__and__</span> specifically improvisation, where improvisation meets composition, that sort of gray area, that you can explore. I mean, I have a, as a youngster, I always improvise, like most of us did. If we were in a rock band, you kind of made up songs and things like that. But I discovered, you know, strange music very early on when I was in junior high school <span style="color:red" data-ts="191.205" data-end_ts="191.405" title="191.205" id=c_"191.205">__and__</span> high school. 'cause I had a music teacher who was very open-minded. So I was hit to John Cage and the residents and serial techniques and that kind of stuff very <span style="color:red" data-ts="199.565" data-end_ts="199.805" title="199.565" id=c_"199.565">__early__</span> on. Early on. But I was also interested in, you know, the improvised world. So kind of trying to make those, you know, put those together. So my background includes, undergraduate degrees in composition and also in percussion. I was, I was, I was kind trained. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>I was trained to be a, a concert percussionist. A classical percussionist. But near the end, I realized that I wanted to be an improviser as well. So after my undergraduate work, I moved to London to study with Eddie Prevo and the band, a MM, he's a percussionist, improviser's, one of the Right. The innovators in free improv. Yeah. For drummers. And while I was there, I spent a year there. After, near the end, I met Anthony Braxton at the time, who I was a big fan of <laugh>. And he said, oh, you know, I'm teaching at Mills College in Oakland, and there you can basically come up with your own, you know, course material, towards the degree. So I ended up moving back to the States, moved to the Bay Area, completed, two master's degrees there because it was, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="260.325" data-end_ts="260.485" title="260.325" id=c_"260.325">__to__</span> kind of overlap. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>So I was able to get them to count certain courses twice. And then I just did a different con, two concerts and two, thesis papers. Sure. So, one of the, one of the degrees in composition, <span style="color:red" data-ts="271.085" data-end_ts="271.285" title="271.085" id=c_"271.085">__the__</span> other degrees in, basically, electronic music, computer, computer music, finished those, degrees. And then, you know, by that point, I was already in the Clubfoot Orchestra playing frequently, and, was in, you know, doing commercial music. We, you know, shortly after that, I got a job as, the music director for a, a television show, the Twisted Tails of Felix the Cat, which was on CBS Saturday morning cartoon with Clubfoot as the band. So, you know, it was just getting into both commercial music and doing a lot of work with improvisation, electronics, and things like that simultaneously. So as a solo artist in bands, and that sort of thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. That's, that's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>The, the background. But my, I'm trained as a percussionist, but I've been around electronics since I was in high school. I had a TEAC four track. I was overdubbing on tape and Oh, yeah. Splice, trying to splice tape, not realizing that <laugh> at the time before I had a course that you don't splice, you know, but splice. <span style="color:red" data-ts="331.465" data-end_ts="331.685" title="331.465" id=c_"331.465">__But__</span> you actually have to, you know, ultimately here I am after all these years, still kind of interested in the same stuff, but, you know, exploring different avenues and working with, you know, working with people I find really fascinating. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, one of the interesting things is that, you know, I know from your work at Electronic Musician, one of the things that you've been doing is sort of like leading the charge to talk about modular systems and stuff like that. And, going back all the way to Mills, you would've been kind of embedded in a bunch of that stuff back then. They were, they were one of the holdouts that kind of was doing modular stuff all the way through the dry period. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>Well, it's weird. It's so funny you say that. 'cause, the first time I, the first real synthesizer electronic music course I had, the, the, the three instruments were a surge and, an EMS Putney, the sort of, you know, wooden case version, and then an EML, I can't remember, I think <span style="color:red" data-ts="391.965" data-end_ts="392.045" title="391.965" id=c_"391.965">__it__</span> was a 1 0 1 ml. So nothing had a keyboard. The, they had a Cricklewood keyboard there, but it didn't work. So it <span style="color:red" data-ts="398.325" data-end_ts="398.405" title="398.325" id=c_"398.325">__was__</span> sort of like, you know, here's, here's a couple tape machines, here's some stints, make electronic music. When I got to mills, it was in the period where they were developing HMSL, their, hierarchical systems, music language, and the emphasis was totally on the algorithm. In fact, I had this interesting, really? Yeah, I had this really interesting, epiphany when I was talking to composer Larry Polanski, who was, you know, one of my grad teachers. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>And, you know, I was saying, why are you using it, Yamaha SBO one to do all your pieces? It's like the dumbest, he <span style="color:red" data-ts="428.205" data-end_ts="428.325" title="428.205" id=c_"428.205">__said__</span> most terrible sound. He, I don't care about the sound, the the art is in the algorithm. And I realized at that minute that I'm in the wrong place <laugh>. Right. For me, I was, you know, I was interested in gesture. I'm interested in the <span style="color:red" data-ts="439.655" data-end_ts="440.005" title="439.655" id=c_"439.655">__timur__</span>. Yeah. You know, and I was trying my best to get into the HMSL thing, and a lot of my friends that succeeded, you know, used it for, you know, creating, physical movements. Like Christina Borowski is a great, composer. She'll have HMSL controlling, you know, dragging leaves around or dragging branches and, and solidifying that, you know, amplifying that. But for me, as a, as a, as a composer, I didn't find it very interesting, you know, and especially as an improviser. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>'cause that's not really what it's for. So anyways, I had that, you know, they had a <span style="color:red" data-ts="471.085" data-end_ts="471.125" title="471.085" id=c_"471.085">__BU__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="471.125" data-end_ts="471.245" title="471.125" id=c_"471.125">__club__</span> there. They had a, a vora, they had the mogue, but those, those weren't commonly used at that time. Everyone was really programming. In fact, many of the grad students going in were coming from computer music backgrounds that had, and they would have no musical experience whatsoever, but they would get a bachelor's in music because they could program Right. Very successfully. These complex, you know, they could, you know, they could imitate Brownian Motion, or Sonify Brownian Motion. And, you know, you'd sit there through a concert. It, you know, I didn't find that very interesting. It was great intellectually, but as a musical piece, that wasn't very satisfying. So as soon as I got out of there, I had a booklet of, 200 that I bought from, David Rosen. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="508.725" data-end_ts="508.885" title="508.725" id=c_"508.725">__Boom__</span>. It was the one, he was, parts of it he was using for his, brainwave music. Oh my. Yeah. You know, I got a feel on that. So I was basically just going back to basics. My graduate recital was a large form piece for solo percussion plus electronics. And it, you know, it was basically a one hour tape piece using all the different techniques I had worked with. Okay. And then I just got back into GE for performance. And then the, but you know, really not really trying to avoid the, you know, the programming aspect of it. And it wasn't until I, I had a chance to work with, Tim Perkiss, who was part, is a member of the Hub, and he has a laptop with a program he designed, I dunno, 20 years ago, he wrote it. And it's just, you know, he's running his laptop, sort of like the, it's, it's modeled after the bu, music easel. Okay. In terms of how it's set up the program. So he's using it TF <span style="color:red" data-ts="560.145" data-end_ts="560.825" title="560.145" id=c_"560.145">__180 1__</span> Z, is that what it is? Oh, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>Yamaha. Yeah. He's using that as a source generator, but he's controlling it, you know, in a way that he's got the same kind of, generative principles that the easel <span style="color:red" data-ts="573.945" data-end_ts="574.145" title="573.945" id=c_"573.945">__has__</span>. So he, it's a very organic sound, and it's a very performable sound. And then he runs it through a volume pedal and aah. So it's, he, when he plays, it's got shaped like an acoustic instrument. And when I saw him play for the first time, I realized, ah, okay. There, he's found his voice. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. He's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>Created an instrument. He's been working on it for now for two decades, and he's a master at it. That's the one, the other issue I have about, I'm sorry, I'm going off here. That's the other issue I had about the Mills thing, is that you build an instrument, you come up with a thing, it's sort of like the case, <span style="color:red" data-ts="603.585" data-end_ts="603.745" title="603.585" id=c_"603.585">__and__</span> you come up with this really wonderful piece, no one's ever done before. You do one performance and then you move on. Right. And no one becomes a virtuoso on their instrument. And so, you know, I run into Tim Perkins, and here's a guy who's a virtuoso on the laptop. <span style="color:red" data-ts="618.205" data-end_ts="618.425" title="618.205" id=c_"618.205">__You__</span>, you don't get the sense that he's reading his email when you see him play <laugh>. He's not doing crazy gestures, but I mean, it's, it's an extremely musical, and he can, he can improvise with a saxophonist or a clarinettist or whatever. And, you know, he's right there. He's not playing loops. He's not Right. You know, fumbling around. He's just right there with the sound. So when you see a master like that, you go, oh, wow, okay. There's the real potential not coming up with new algorithms every, every, you know, year, but really, you know, finding your, your instrument and really perfecting it. So, you know, that's kind of rare in our world, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I, it, it really is. And, and, you know, I, I have to admit that I've been preaching about that too. This, the, the sort of like, almost consumable nature of the technology makes it so that you don't see people that are getting really super deep knowledge. I think it's funny, it's funny that you mentioned he was using a TX 81 Z as a, as a source, or as a generation device, because that TX 81 Z has come up in conversations like a dozen times in the last two weeks, <laugh>. So, I don't know, there's something, something in the air about those things, and I have a feeling, or I have a fear that that's gonna be the next TB 3 0 3. Right. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>Well, it's funny because, you know, he buys them up and he, he takes them <span style="color:red" data-ts="701.385" data-end_ts="701.545" title="701.385" id=c_"701.385">__outta__</span> the case and puts him in a small Tupperware, so it makes it easier to schlep around. Right. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. And 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>He tried to emulate it with, you know, the different FM software <span style="color:red" data-ts="712.225" data-end_ts="712.465" title="712.225" id=c_"712.225">__since__</span> that come out, you know. <span style="color:red" data-ts="713.395" data-end_ts="713.685" title="713.395" id=c_"713.395">__Sure__</span>. FM seven and all that kind <span style="color:red" data-ts="715.605" data-end_ts="715.685" title="715.605" id=c_"715.605">__of__</span> stuff. He just can't, <span style="color:red" data-ts="716.285" data-end_ts="716.445" title="716.285" id=c_"716.285">__for__</span>, there's something about that setup of that instrument that just sounds the way he needs it to. So yeah. Maybe it is the next DB 3 0 3, but it, you know, that's good because at the time, it was a pain to use. Oh. But now people, people have the, you know, we have the technology to get a little deeper, and it's not so, you know, impenetrable well as a playable instrument. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. And maybe it takes 20 years for that to really develop. I mean, the, the idea that, you know, I, you would know this better than I, is there any instrument in electronic music that existed 20 years ago that still exists and has existed throughout that time? I guess the Surge Modular has been around through that period. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>Yeah. You know, you know, the, anything that was hardware, okay. It's probably still here. It's still working. Right. You know. Right, right. But, but your stuff, but your computers, I mean, how many computers have you gone through in the last 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>20 years? <laugh> years in 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>The <span style="color:red" data-ts="775.975" data-end_ts="776.015" title="775.975" id=c_"775.975">__last__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="776.275" data-end_ts="776.495" title="776.275" id=c_"776.275">__the__</span> door stopped all over the house. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's right. Luckily, I, I, I seem to generate children as quickly as computers, so I always <laugh>, I always have a place for the computer to go. <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b><laugh>. But, you know, it's, it's just a, it's a, it's a strange thing that there's not, I mean, the, the turntable, you know, this turntable turntable ism, the fact that people are out there making an instrument out of it. Now you can, you know, well now, I mean, the last 10 or 15 years has been control systems. So you can have a, an analog turntable, you know, tracked by your computer and all that kind of stuff. And that's, you know, I think that's a very valid instrument for a, a portion of the, the music creating community. But, you know, there are no electronic instruments except the thein that are as old to say a Stratocaster. Right. You know? Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>You know, you got, there are people are, are, are really using a lot. You know, I just met a person yesterday, I bought a manual, an old synth manual from somebody, and he says, oh yeah, you know, I've got some EMU modules and I've got some, like a old, Moog 15, and I've got this and that. And I'm like, wow, you know, this guy's just hiding away. He's got these things, you know, and I'm thinking, okay. So time's up by, you know, several thousand, there's these instruments hiding away that people just don't use, but are, you know, and of course, a collector will probably buy some of those and put 'em away and Alright. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>And just dust them off <span style="color:red" data-ts="863.225" data-end_ts="863.345" title="863.225" id=c_"863.225">__a__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="863.345" data-end_ts="863.465" title="863.345" id=c_"863.345">__kid__</span>, which is a shame, you know, because they're, I mean, there's nothing wrong with an old mogue if you've got, if you know what to do with it, you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Know? Right, right. Yeah. Well, it's, it's funny because you do get this sense that when these things are found, it's just a matter of time and they end up in somebody's, you know, hidden away in somebody's safe somewhere. Sadly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>I mean, back to the thing about the analog modules, for me it was, I think when I first started it, when I started, the reason I took the job <span style="color:red" data-ts="889.305" data-end_ts="889.465" title="889.305" id=c_"889.305">__at__</span> Electronic Musician was, you know, we had our second child coming, and I needed a job that had benefits, and my wife was going part-time on her job. So luckily I got a full-time gig at the magazine. And luckily I had an editor, Steve Oppenheimer, who was really open-minded. He'd been, you know, he was around, his brother had worked, for art. I believe her knew some of the people at ARP at the time from Boston. Right. So, you know, the idea of like, Hey, you know, look what Dopers doing. Look what blasts doing. Here are all these modules. And he said, yeah, it's kind of a nichey thing. But here we are 15 years later and it's like, you know, it's keeping a lot, it's totally changed, <span style="color:red" data-ts="926.725" data-end_ts="927.125" title="926.725" id=c_"926.725">__Dieter__</span> Dopers life. Right. You know, it's brought all these huge companies and anybody can come up with a module and suddenly, you know, I mean, it may not be necessarily a good one, but it's like stomp boxes, people can come up with their own crazy idea or rip off somebody else, at least have their own, you know, front panel design <laugh>. But it's, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>You know, I think it's like the music biz. It's like once you have a CDR or once you have a cassette, people can put off their own music. Yep. And I don't think that's bad. I think it's actually good, because occasionally there'll be somebody who totally kills it, you know, does an amazing job. So, alright, there's a million people in the, a million players in the game, but there's also a couple of geniuses that wouldn't have been able to get their ideas out had it not had the entry been so low, you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Know? Right. And I think, I think also that there's, there's a couple of, there's a couple of things that have happened that really swung the door open. So I was involved with, with Grant Richter back in the day when he was just kicking off wired. And at that time, to get someone to do a small quantity of electronic circuit boards was extraordinarily difficult to get somebody who would do a small number of panels. Extraordinarily difficult. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1002.015" data-end_ts="1002.365" title="1002.015" id=c_"1002.015">__Right__</span>. It was, but if you combine sort of like the changes in education with the whole kind of maker movement and the idea of sort of like hacker becoming, mainstream, all these things kind of open up the door to what you said, which is the ability maybe for a genius to appear that wouldn't have existed had it not been for, for this kind of like shift in, not only in consumer, concepts, but also in in manufacturing capability. I mean, it happening. Guitar pedals absolutely. Is certainly happening with modules right now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>Absolutely. And you've got the folks in Portland, you know, there's like five or six manufacturers being, you know, this stuff is being built in Portland Right. By that group. And, you know, I think that's fantastic. It's sort of, you know, it's, it's a cottage industry, but it's, you know, it's <laugh>. It's more, it's not, it's more than that. It's very sophisticated. Yeah.

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And it's keeping people fed <span style="color:red" data-ts="1060.685" data-end_ts="1060.725" title="1060.685" id=c_"1060.685">__<laugh>__</span>. But I think, I think, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>And I think you're right about it being, you know, the maker movement and everything, it's, it's, it's all wrapped up. It's the same people. I mean, the people who are making analog modules, many of them are coders and they're putting, you know, sophisticated, you know, algorithms behind a panel and allowing you to, you know, see if you control 'em. Great. You know, some people want to have all analog fine, some people want <span style="color:red" data-ts="1084.285" data-end_ts="1084.405" title="1084.285" id=c_"1084.285">__to__</span> have hybrid. Fine. You don't, you don't. And I, you know, for me, I've got, I've got Max on my computer. I did a piece with, the ROA saxophone quartet. And I Maori, I Maori did the video. So I did the mu, I did the composition. ROA was running through, I was sampling them with Max while they're playing live, processing it in Max, and then running the output through analog modules, filters, and all kinds of stuff like that. And, you know, it, it's something I could do in a, in a small case, a small Europe case in, in an affordable way, which, you know, 30 years ago it would've been, you know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>A lot harder to do what I was doing. Right. So, you know, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1130.515" data-end_ts="1130.675" title="1130.515" id=c_"1130.515">__have__</span>, it's just, it's just these, it's just tools, you know. And luckily for me, what I like about my job is I get to meet a people like you who have been on the, on the, the building end and designing end of tools. And also I get to hear, you know, what's coming down the pike. But ultimately I have to get off my butt and I have to make music <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. I hear that. So I wanna get back to discussing music because you dropped a little nugget that I'm really curious about. And with NAMM coming up, I'm even, I had always come to my mind, you said that you were influenced into kind of like weird music, from a music teacher. And I, and a lot, a lot of people who, end up becoming composers, experimental musicians, experimental recordists or sound artists, have that same experience. And, you know, every year when I go to namm, one of the things that NAMM really does is they bring to the forefront this idea of the importance of music education. I'd like to hear a little bit more about your experience with this teacher and how he stimulated you into what eventually became your career. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>You know, it was, it was the fact that he was a church organist, and he knew a lot of people. We would go to concerts, you know, and there would be some kind of contemporary music. There was a, you know, it was just the fact, I don't <span style="color:red" data-ts="1218.945" data-end_ts="1219.025" title="1218.945" id=c_"1218.945">__know__</span> if whoever hasn't really worked with church organ, church organists have had advanced musical content since the late 19th century. They're <span style="color:red" data-ts="1228.115" data-end_ts="1228.465" title="1228.115" id=c_"1228.115">__there__</span>. There are organ pieces that are extremely atonal and out sounding from before the 20th century. And when you play that music, it really, your ears, not to say the compositional techniques weren't, you know, like Sternberg or <span style="color:red" data-ts="1241.985" data-end_ts="1242.105" title="1241.985" id=c_"1241.985">__Aver__</span> or whatever, but, you know, they're pretty out stuff. So his ears were pretty open, and he was opening my ears. Second, you know, when you're a percussionist, you automatically play percussion works by contemporary composers. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>So, you know, when I'm studying with my drum teacher, you know, we're listening to Cage, we're listening to Lou Harrison. Sure. Parlo Chavez. So, you know, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1264.485" data-end_ts="1264.645" title="1264.485" id=c_"1264.485">__ne__</span> what's the next step? The next step <span style="color:red" data-ts="1265.965" data-end_ts="1266.165" title="1265.965" id=c_"1265.965">__as__</span> well, you know, there are these pieces for percussion and tape. Oh, well, what is that? You know? And then there are pieces for just tape. Oh, <laugh>. You know, and then you then, you know, there's a friend of mine at some point had a, a micro <span style="color:red" data-ts="1278.715" data-end_ts="1279.005" title="1278.715" id=c_"1278.715">__mode__</span> synthesizer, you know, and say, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1281.085" data-end_ts="1281.285" title="1281.085" id=c_"1281.085">__oh__</span>, can I borrow that for a couple weeks? You know, then it's like, it's got an input. What do you do with the input? How do you make that work? So it's just sort of lucky, you know, I from a very small town at the time, you know, an hour from la. So, you know, you just, you, I was just <span style="color:red" data-ts="1298.185" data-end_ts="1298.305" title="1298.185" id=c_"1298.185">__having__</span> to be in the right place at the right time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>My drum instructor in, in high school, we had a really strong marching band program. The first few years we, the drum instructor <span style="color:red" data-ts="1308.085" data-end_ts="1308.305" title="1308.085" id=c_"1308.085">__was__</span>, was a drummer. So he, you know, he let us have free reign on crazy stuff. So it's kind of like, you know, hearing Zappa, hearing the black page as a freshman and going, wow, I wonder if we can fit this into a marching <laugh> <laugh>. We can put this kind of stuff over, you know, in our cadences. How do you fit a seven over, you know, four and Right. So it's just, you know, my mind is blowing up. And then when I was getting ready to go to college, my piano teacher said, you know, don't go to the city College. You should go to university in this University of Redlands nearby. Okay. The, the leader of the music department there, or <span style="color:red" data-ts="1344.025" data-end_ts="1344.145" title="1344.025" id=c_"1344.025">__I__</span> should say, not the leader, but you know, they had a really strong contemporary music program thanks to Barney Childs composer, Barney Childs. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>Okay. Who knew Cage and all these people. He had written a really wonderful book on contemporary, interviewing contemporary, composers. So I had four years with him, with those synthesizers, and with these compositional ideas and learning about fluxus and on, so, you know, right place, right time. Now, if I'd grown up somewhere else in the, you know, the south, and I was around country music, you know, for example, exclusively, it would've been a different deal. I just happened to be Right. You know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1377.385" data-end_ts="1377.545" title="1377.385" id=c_"1377.385">__and__</span>, but at the same time, I'm playing in rock bands. Punk was really big when I was in high school <span style="color:red" data-ts="1381.805" data-end_ts="1382.025" title="1381.805" id=c_"1381.805">__and__</span> college, the punk band, I had open for bands like, you know, circle Jerk and stuff. So, you know, I was deeply into, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1391.245" data-end_ts="1391.465" title="1391.245" id=c_"1391.245">__the__</span> rock and, you know, that kind of music as well. Right. And, and, and improv. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>So it just, it was sort of juggling all these different things. I think because I'm a drummer and a percussionist that automatically opens doors when you're young to weird stuff. Because, you know, a new piece comes in that says, like, my favorite piece, it asks for a beef flat, barbecue lid, <laugh>. So, you know, what do you have to do? You have to go to <laugh> the hardware store, lift all the barbecue lids with a tuning fork, find the beef flap, and then somehow talk <span style="color:red" data-ts="1426.325" data-end_ts="1426.445" title="1426.325" id=c_"1426.325">__them__</span> into letting you buy it by itself. You know? So when you do that, when you're in high school, it, it's all over it. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1432.485" data-end_ts="1432.565" title="1432.485" id=c_"1432.485">__Game__</span> over <span style="color:red" data-ts="1432.825" data-end_ts="1433.045" title="1432.825" id=c_"1432.825">__All__</span> right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>You suddenly realize there that playing, playing Tchaikovsky's boring, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>As a drummer. Anyways. I mean, if you're a violin, that's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1440.445" data-end_ts="1440.525" title="1440.445" id=c_"1440.445">__a__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1440.525" data-end_ts="1440.765" title="1440.525" id=c_"1440.525">__thing__</span>. But, so that's kind of the background. It just, it escalates from there, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That's, that's really interesting though. And it's really fun to kind of hear that, that tour of duty, because I have to admit, so I, I just, I was always too nervous to be involved in a school band, but, I certainly did dance around with a lot of different kinds of music, because I grew up in the Midwest, which has no music of its own. So you just do bits and pieces of everybody else's music. So, you know, I played country one day and, rock and roll the next and classical the day after that. And so it flopping around that was really nice. But I can see where, first of all, being a percussionist, but secondly, kind of being in that neck of the woods would give you a lot of opportunity. That must have been amazing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>Yeah. I mean, my <span style="color:red" data-ts="1494.005" data-end_ts="1494.165" title="1494.005" id=c_"1494.005">__temp__</span>. Okay, so the beef flat barbecue. That's right. It's, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1496.375" data-end_ts="1496.725" title="1496.375" id=c_"1496.375">__craft__</span>. Okay. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1497.285" data-end_ts="1497.565" title="1497.285" id=c_"1497.285">__Because__</span> he was my, right. He was my, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1499.595" data-end_ts="1499.885" title="1499.595" id=c_"1499.595">__temp__</span> teacher. I was like, I, I met him at a conference when I was in high school, and I wanted to study composition, and he asked me some basic orchestrational questions that, that I didn't, I couldn't answer. He says, well, let's start with drum lessons first, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1511.405" data-end_ts="1511.805" title="1511.405" id=c_"1511.405">__temping__</span> lessons, and then we'll work up to composition. So, you know, every time I had a temping lesson, I'd be pestering him for, you know, composition ideas, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>But, you know, yeah. Being <span style="color:red" data-ts="1520.965" data-end_ts="1521.125" title="1520.965" id=c_"1520.965">__asked__</span> to LA and Hollywood, at the same time, I would go and take lessons at the Dick Grove School of Music. Right. You know, orchestration lessons for big band and stuff like that. So, yeah. I mean, being near a major city center Now, on the other hand, on the downside, the, the artistic quality of the jazz in that area is really low. Oh, wow. So I was not, you know, the kinds of people, it was really about the sort of high-tech, disneyfied big band sound, which I couldn't relate to. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And once I got the, you know, once I, I got a, a Braxton record in my hand, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1554.735" data-end_ts="1555.085" title="1554.735" id=c_"1554.735">__Harla__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1555.205" data-end_ts="1555.285" title="1555.205" id=c_"1555.205">__<inaudible>__</span>, I realized, oh, okay. You know, big band <span style="color:red" data-ts="1557.925" data-end_ts="1558.125" title="1557.925" id=c_"1557.925">__can__</span> be something else. Now, that's something you'd only hear at that time, really, if you were lucky, could be on the East Coast or, you know, in those areas like Chicago with the a CM and stuff like that. Right. But, you know, thankfully, I, I found that, 'cause I had had little interest in jazz up until that point, except they have to play it in high school and stuff. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>But you're right, it really is totally about where you are. But now with the internet, I mean, this is the, the crazy thing about today is that, you know, once you're on Facebook and you have, you know, 30 or 40 friends, all of a sudden you see their interests and you find videos of, you know, Luciano Barrio or whatever, and, you know, you don't have to go to the library and hope the library has a record <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, it's Right. It's that. But also, software has kind of changed the game too. So a couple of weeks ago, I talked to Giorgio <span style="color:red" data-ts="1607.905" data-end_ts="1608.125" title="1607.905" id=c_"1607.905">__San__</span>, San Christopher, who, developed, he's, he had an opportunity to work in like one of these obscure, electronic music and tape centers in Europe. And he was able to make a software emulation of it that he sells for like 10 bucks. Right. This is, you know, even, even when we were young, the technology would've made it cheaper in that it would've only cost as much of a, as a house, you know? But before that, it would've cost as much as a city block. You know, it's amazing. Right now, the technology really does open the doors too, for people who have an experimental bent to get their hands on stuff that gives them a chance to try it out. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>Oh, yeah. I mean, people, you know, will complain when there's a $500 oscillator into Eurorack form. Right, right. You know, but if you look at an ARC catalog from whatever it is, 1973, the oscillator in there is $800, and that's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1665.515" data-end_ts="1665.595" title="1665.515" id=c_"1665.515">__in__</span> 1970 $2. Right. And you go, dude, <laugh>, you know, get a, but on the other hand, yeah, you can, you can get a free, you can get what Able <span style="color:red" data-ts="1674.475" data-end_ts="1674.715" title="1674.475" id=c_"1674.475">__some__</span> live for free. Yeah. A version. You can download all these great free plugins and immediately make interesting sounds. It's interesting. Or at least, you know, learn how to do stuff. And then it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1685.935" data-end_ts="1686.155" title="1685.935" id=c_"1685.935">__the__</span>, the barrier. So I'm, I'm reading a really interesting book on the history of clocks and time pieces. Okay. The very first real pocket watch that worked, or pocket watch size watch that worked something from like 1735 or whatever it, it costs about the equivalent of a hundred thousand dollars to build. And you just think about that and you go, okay, that, you know, there's the RCA synthesizer. Right? Right. That's just that equivalent. Whereas now you can, you know, you can buy a watch for $10 and it's probably more precise. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>That's the history of technology there. And we, you know, a lot of people complain, well, the music was a lot better, you know, back then, or whatever. You know, I teach, I teach a Pro Tools course. I teach actually two, two different sections of Pro Tools course at a local city college. So I see kids come in for the first time using Pro Tools, but they're already masters of something like Fruity Loops. Right. <laugh>, or they've got chops on, they've got chops on Ableson Live, and they come in and they do really sophisticated stuff. And it may be in the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1744.925" data-end_ts="1745.145" title="1744.925" id=c_"1744.925">__rap__</span> world or the metal world, or the, the Glitch world, but, you know, they're 17 years old. They have no idea who stock <span style="color:red" data-ts="1751.185" data-end_ts="1751.425" title="1751.185" id=c_"1751.185">__housing__</span> is, no idea who, you know, all these predecessors are, but they're, they're killing it because this is their instrument and they're becoming, you know, their ear. So if I come in and I play, okay, here's, we're gonna do, we're gonna do an assignment where we don't use a keyboard. Here's some early tape music to go, oh, okay. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I know. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>It's, they don't <span style="color:red" data-ts="1769.585" data-end_ts="1769.665" title="1769.585" id=c_"1769.585">__know__</span>. It's like film music. Right. You know? Yeah. It's like film music. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1771.865" data-end_ts="1771.985" title="1771.865" id=c_"1771.865">__I__</span> go do a piece, whatever. It's, you know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's, it's funny you said that because there's, there's two things that people tend to angle. I, I also, I teach a sound art class, which is sort of like giving, visual artists a chance to play around with sound. Right. It's fantastic. But when I kind of introduce them and I say, here's the direction we're gonna go, they'll either say, oh, this is like, this is like a film soundtrack. Or they'll be like, oh, I listen to one Oh Tricks point never all the time. And so I'm used to this. Right. Yeah. And I'm like, that's amazing. Because for me, growing up, you really had to find that the person, like in your county that knew who Stockhausen was in order to, in order to catch wind of this stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>Yeah. It's, and you know, the top, the whole thing <span style="color:red" data-ts="1816.565" data-end_ts="1816.685" title="1816.565" id=c_"1816.565">__was__</span>, you know, in the future we'll be listening to blah, blah, blah, you know, stock <span style="color:red" data-ts="1819.485" data-end_ts="1819.645" title="1819.485" id=c_"1819.485">__housing__</span>, whoever listens to music of the future. It's true. But what they didn't predict is that all this music would have a, you know, four <span style="color:red" data-ts="1825.285" data-end_ts="1825.525" title="1825.285" id=c_"1825.285">__four__</span> beat under it. A 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Beat. Right. Exactly. Simplest beat ever. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>Yeah. Which <span style="color:red" data-ts="1830.685" data-end_ts="1830.845" title="1830.685" id=c_"1830.685">__is__</span>, you know, as a drummer and a percussion that's kind of, you know, oh my God. Or <span style="color:red" data-ts="1834.275" data-end_ts="1834.565" title="1834.275" id=c_"1834.275">__kind__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Of a drag. Yeah. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>What can you do about that, but fine. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1838.185" data-end_ts="1838.405" title="1838.185" id=c_"1838.185">__Oh__</span>, there's, that's the way it's, there's still room for Polyrhythms, so we hope <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>Yeah. And I think the nice, there's, there's all these really great tools in the electronic, in the computer side and on the, on the, catalog analog side that can, you know, tear that stuff. What I just, I just looked at the new, you know, a couple gate sequencers, one from Ecco, you know, it, it allows you to create, it's a very small, inexpensive module, and you can set up all these great poly rhythms. You almost too easily. Right. You know, once you've got a couple things to control. So, okay. Hopefully people will, will work with that and not just work with one four, you know, all the time. Right. But it, you know, I can't complain about people who are creating art because, you know, they probably don't like what I do sometimes. And that's fine. I mean, we're all the, the point is that for me is to push the, the creation aspect of the art and not the over analysis of it. Right. <laugh> and that, you know, it's, it's, you know, you have to remind people <span style="color:red" data-ts="1898.315" data-end_ts="1898.535" title="1898.315" id=c_"1898.315">__to__</span>, don't, don't think about it. Just do it. Look at it later, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You know? Right. Well, it's, I have to say though, that I, I am encouraged by, the open ears. The, the young people that I work with that are, are learning the, the openness of their ears in comparison to, again, when I was growing up or, you know, maybe even 10 years ago. It's, it's really pretty amazing. So I have to, I have to hand out props to that, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>Well, certainly there's a, there's a lot of great, electronic music, composers, you know, in the EVM or electronica space that are just, you know, are, you can kind of thank for that. It brought in really obscure musical, you know, references in sort of, under the guise of dances that are under the guise of beat <span style="color:red" data-ts="1949.135" data-end_ts="1949.375" title="1949.135" id=c_"1949.135">__based__</span> music. And, you know, so now people have, yeah. They have definitely <span style="color:red" data-ts="1952.935" data-end_ts="1953.135" title="1952.935" id=c_"1952.935">__open__</span> ears, open minds to a certain extent. You know, sometimes the lay person still needs to have a beat, but at least the people making the music, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1960.665" data-end_ts="1960.885" title="1960.665" id=c_"1960.665">__the__</span>, the, the creative class, so to speak, of people using electronics tends to, you know, they're excited about stuff that they've never heard, which is great. You know, at least they, they'll give it a listen, and then they'll sample it and they'll put it in their own music, for sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So, I'm curious, you know, I look around my desk and I have all kinds of, all kinds of gadgets all over my desk and in the cadenza next to my desk and on the floor alongside my desk. And, I notice a, a trend, which is that things kind of flow onto my desk and then off. But there are some things that just stay for a long time because I kind of fall in love with 'em. Right. I'm curious about your desk. You get a chance to touch probably every piece of electronic, what, whatever that exists. What is the stuff that stays on your desk? 'cause you love it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>I like the stuff that allows me to quickly get gestural sound, intuitively get gestural sound out, or translate gesture into sound without having to futs with things. So I don't, I know there's a learning curve with a lot of things. Right. You know, programming stuff. So I, I, I tend to lean towards stuff that is gesture based in a sort of way where I can, like, I'll, I'll give an example <span style="color:red" data-ts="2039.385" data-end_ts="2039.605" title="2039.385" id=c_"2039.385">__of__</span> a capacitance keyboard on my, my, booklet. 200 E Oh yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2044.365" data-end_ts="2044.525" title="2044.365" id=c_"2044.365">__Right__</span>. You know, I can map that in any way. So, you know, if it's got that kind of thing, great. 'cause I'm a hands-on person. I play prepared piano, but very often I'm in there playing harmonics on the low strings and uhhuh, you know, muting with my hand. So I, I, I like that. So, you know, I have a, I'm looking right now at a, at a small Eurorack case that I have. Oh. And I like, I like being fooled by things. I like stuff that's a little bit, unpredictable or a lot unpredictable. Okay. So, right now I've got, for example, a Benin module because Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>My touring, my, as a drummer, when I tour as a percussion improvising percussionist, I used to bring a lot of things that were, I called duet partners. For example, motorized pencils. I can put it on a floor to put a little towel over it and it'll bounce around <span style="color:red" data-ts="2092.505" data-end_ts="2092.725" title="2092.505" id=c_"2092.505">__Oh__</span>, sure. On the drum. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>Making, you know, rhythms that I don't control. But that's my duet partner. So now I have the synthesizer I have that goes with me everywhere is the, the BPO box Rob Dyke's BPO box. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Because 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>It's, you know, it's got two really steep, wonderful filters. Two oscillators. And the ronler system is very <inaudible>, you know, source of uncertainty, like for me. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So that's kind of my <span style="color:red" data-ts="2117.695" data-end_ts="2118.045" title="2117.695" id=c_"2117.695">__sense__</span>. I can put my hand over it. The chicken head knobs, I can control them all, <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>One hand, you know. Sure. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>But it's that sort of unpredictability that I like. Semi unpredictable. Semi unpredictable. Plus the tone. So, you know, things that come through that I'm, I'm really in, for example, are things that have a joystick or, you know, yes. Whatever it is that has a certain bit of unpredictability, I'm all for it. So, yeah. Things are coming through the, the modules come through, especially a lot. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2149.555" data-end_ts="2149.775" title="2149.555" id=c_"2149.555">__And__</span> I like that kind of stuff, without being too specific. So keyboard, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2156.225" data-end_ts="2156.575" title="2156.225" id=c_"2156.225">__since__</span>, you know, that's great when I have to play a, go to a recording session and play a part. Right, right. You know, I have a, my favorite keyboard, one of my favorite monophonic keyboards of all time is the, Mo <span style="color:red" data-ts="2169.145" data-end_ts="2169.495" title="2169.145" id=c_"2169.145">__Sonic__</span> six. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>I, you know, I think it's, you know, it's got this certain thing, the double LFO and the way it interacts with sound. I just love if somebody says, play a lead, you know, on a sort of, or play a melody in there. I like that. Right. Or my pro one, I've got a secret keyboard I can't talk about yet. 'cause I can't just divulge this before mam. Right. But it's a core instrument. It's really, it's an analog instrument, keyboard instrument, but it's, it's got the right footprint, or it's got all the stuff in the front panel that I want, which is I can, I can change. It's a four voice analog s synth. Okay. Portable, lightweight, low cost, and all the controls make sense. It's easy to play, and yet you can get it into kind of modes where it, you know, it's, it's a little bit <span style="color:red" data-ts="2217.675" data-end_ts="2217.895" title="2217.675" id=c_"2217.675">__out__</span> of control. It's like you're riding this sort of Bronco aspect. <laugh>, you kind of get that with that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's, that's cool. Yeah. Like <span style="color:red" data-ts="2224.055" data-end_ts="2224.175" title="2224.055" id=c_"2224.055">__those__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>I like that. I like, I like to be, you know, riding that Bronco. And that's part of my performance thing is as an improviser is like, you know, working around it. 'cause you know, to go, Robert Rich is one of my favorite people in the central <span style="color:red" data-ts="2240.935" data-end_ts="2241.095" title="2240.935" id=c_"2240.935">__role__</span>. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. I like how he works, but his mindset is to, is to set up a patch that he knows inside it out, and he can perform it. And it's, you know, he's kind of, to a certain extent, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2250.215" data-end_ts="2250.415" title="2250.215" id=c_"2250.215">__it's__</span> very predictable with a slight bit of unpredictability, but he's really going forward, you know, having it all figured out. Whereas I'm, I like to patch live like the people that, like the solder circus live. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. You know? Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>There's, there's gonna be some dead air, there's gonna be some crap. But when you, when it works, it really works so well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's a rodeo. I mean, a rodeo sometimes it's, is really boring, and sometimes it's scary, you know, <laugh>. And that's, that's what it's, it reminds you of, it reminds me of a rodeo, because sometimes you're just watching somebody hang on for dear life. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>Yeah. And I think that's what's in all music <span style="color:red" data-ts="2284.575" data-end_ts="2284.795" title="2284.575" id=c_"2284.575">__of__</span> every kind of music when I'm attracted to it, there is a sort of danger element. Right. You know, there. So I'll give you a concrete example. My favorite band, one of my favorite bands is the Zappa Band around say, 19 72, 73 era. That era. Right. You know, they're playing these pieces that are on the edge of playability, and they're playing <span style="color:red" data-ts="2306.075" data-end_ts="2306.235" title="2306.075" id=c_"2306.075">__it__</span> sometimes at tempos that are almost impossible. You listen to all <span style="color:red" data-ts="2309.075" data-end_ts="2309.195" title="2309.075" id=c_"2309.075">__the__</span>, to the bootleg, you go, wow, these guys are kicking it. You listen to Zappa on Zappa, they're playing the same material. They're playing it expertly, but there's no danger element. Right. There's not, they're not being pushed, they're not afraid of the conductor turning around and suddenly changing the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2325.485" data-end_ts="2325.685" title="2325.485" id=c_"2325.485">__feel__</span> or changing the tempo. Right. You know, or throwing them <span style="color:red" data-ts="2327.965" data-end_ts="2328.085" title="2327.965" id=c_"2327.965">__a__</span> new piece the next day. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>So, you know, it's that on the edge of falling apart. I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2332.725" data-end_ts="2332.925" title="2332.725" id=c_"2332.725">__love__</span> in all the artwork that I, whether it's visual art or, you know, sound art, I, that really appeals to me <span style="color:red" data-ts="2339.085" data-end_ts="2339.285" title="2339.085" id=c_"2339.085">__seeing__</span> that danger. So, as a performer, as a drummer, I, I go out, I don't go out with a drum set. I bring a box of stuff, symbols and noise makers, and, and weird, you know, things like motorized pencils and stuff, drink mixers, and I, it's a performance. It's like, okay, so I show up. If there are drums there, great. If there aren't, I'll go to the kitchen. I'll bring out pots and pans and I'll, I'll do a performance. You know? So that's my personal interest. And yet, you know, I, I like music that's set up ahead of time. I like, I, I will listen to stuff that is highly technically, you know, pre-created or pre-determined. Yeah. Yeah. But, you know, I kind of like the sort of indeterminate danger element. You're an improviser too. You can, I mean, you, you understand that. And I think it's just, it's sometimes hard to get that across to people who will spend, you know, weeks, weeks rehearsing a piece to play it. And you go, okay, that's great. <laugh>. Well, I think <span style="color:red" data-ts="2392.025" data-end_ts="2392.245" title="2392.025" id=c_"2392.025">__see__</span> a little facile, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I think, I think sometimes. So I went to music school, I went to, I went to North Texas where they kind of pushed you into like, crazy groups. And I learned to do, ensemble based, improvisation. It was great. It was, it was exciting. And I learned how to deal with it. And I learned how to like, listen while, you know, while you're preparing to play and all those kind of things. It was fantastic. But I realized that somebody, one of the things electronic music right now allows you to do is sort of like, live in your mom's basement, never really interact with anybody and, you know, polish something into being extraordinarily amazing. But the idea of then that person now getting up in front of a crowd and making it up, I can understand why they're like, eh, you know what? I'm gonna, I, I need to press play right now. You know, I think that there's, I think that there's a new kind of performer coming up, and it's performers who largely did not get their chops by playing live. And so I can, I can understand it, even though if I, I'm like you, I, I really like the risk element a lot. My favorite thing to ever <span style="color:red" data-ts="2462.165" data-end_ts="2462.325" title="2462.165" id=c_"2462.165">__see__</span>, you <span style="color:red" data-ts="2462.525" data-end_ts="2462.605" title="2462.525" id=c_"2462.525">__were__</span> talking about the Zappa band. I got a chance to see Sun <span style="color:red" data-ts="2466.345" data-end_ts="2466.565" title="2466.345" id=c_"2466.345">__Ron__</span> the orchestra one time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>Oh yeah. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh my God. It was just watching everybody, like looking at, you know, like staring him down to see if he's gonna move his hand in a little way or whatever. The other person I remember seeing doing this, that was, you know, he had everybody on their toes was Ray Charles. The Ray Charles band was like notorious for like, they'd have to watch the heel of his feet, because that would really be who was conducting the band. It was amazing stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>You know, the tough thing these days is in, in those days, you know, Ray Charles is working every day. Yeah. Right. The band is touring and playing. Right. The jazz band in the old days, even early Sun <span style="color:red" data-ts="2504.785" data-end_ts="2505.005" title="2504.785" id=c_"2504.785">__Raw__</span>, there's a place to play for a week solid. Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2507.765" data-end_ts="2507.925" title="2507.765" id=c_"2507.765">__Right__</span>. Now, no one has a chance to play anywhere. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You get, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>You know, so you don't get to, you don't get to have that, you know, week of working with your band on stage. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2518.085" data-end_ts="2518.245" title="2518.085" id=c_"2518.085">__Right__</span>. You work with your band off stage, and then maybe you get a chance to play a couple of gigs here and there. Right. That's a different thing. But I agree. Yeah, I agree. There's a whole, I mean, you know, there's nowhere to play, first of all, half the time. Yeah. There 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Really isn't. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>But there's all these tools to work with, so people work in their basement, <laugh>, you know, it's, but you know, at the same, it's, it's an interesting thing because, you know, it's, you can't even be that cut and dry because there's so many, you know, it's so gray in between those two polar things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, right. Because when you, when you record something and put it up on YouTube, was that a performance? Was that a recording? You know, it's all over the map, even there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>Yeah. And, you know, it is a performance because ultimately people are gonna be able to watch everything you did. Watch that little piece of snot dripping outta your nose while you're soloing, <laugh>, you know, over and over and over again. So you, you know, it's, in fact, it's more terrifying than a gig where it's done. You can say, God, I'm, you know, I'm glad that's done <laugh>. But you know, you take, when I went over to, Roger Lynn's house, and he's showing me the, the instrument, and he says, you know, he's got a couple of videos of some people who've been, you know, really hacking into the software and getting some, you know, interesting instruments to play from it. They're just playing on, on, you know, for YouTube. So they're at that home playing the music they love. Really. They're not, they're not out there, you know, backing up the next way, Charles or whoever, Bruno Mars or whatever, they're, they're at home making their craft fine. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>That's great. They don't have to, I mean, they don't have to go <span style="color:red" data-ts="2606.405" data-end_ts="2606.565" title="2606.405" id=c_"2606.405">__up__</span> play for me, but if they're doing YouTube things, that is a little bit terrifying, you know, ultimately, even though you can kind of wait until you get the perfect performance before you put it up. Right. You know? But I don't know. I, I, you're, I mean, you're right. And yet it's, it's just so, it is so varied. I'll run into people and it's, there's all sorts of gray, all that gray stuff in between, which is fantastic. You know, I think, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2631.505" data-end_ts="2631.725" title="2631.505" id=c_"2631.505">__God__</span>, we live, Braxton calls this the, post future. Right. You know, and it's because the future was supposed to look different. Yeah. And yet we don't have flying cars. We barely have, you know, automatic driving cars. You know, we also wear, we still wear the same clothes we did in the seventies, but <laugh>, you know, we can see anybody's work, you know, anywhere on the planet at any time. Right. And it's just, it really is amazing. I mean, all 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>To, we all have our own <span style="color:red" data-ts="2660.305" data-end_ts="2660.525" title="2660.305" id=c_"2660.305">__tri__</span> quarters, they're just called iPhones. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>Exactly. You know, I wish I could beam myself somewhere. <laugh>. That's what I'm looking for. Right. I'm <span style="color:red" data-ts="2669.565" data-end_ts="2669.645" title="2669.565" id=c_"2669.565">__getting__</span>, I'm preparing, I'm preparing for a, a tour, you know, a trip to Italy. And, you know, it's like, the hardest part about this whole thing is the travel part. I just wanna show up at a place, play with my favorite musicians and not have it take, you know, 24 hours and three, you know. Right. Three trips <span style="color:red" data-ts="2684.605" data-end_ts="2684.805" title="2684.605" id=c_"2684.605">__to__</span> an airport to do it. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Indeed. Well, Gino, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2687.845" data-end_ts="2688.325" title="2687.845" id=c_"2687.845">__alright__</span>, we've blown through our time and I just feel like we just got started. And so I'm definitely gonna ask you for a return engagement soon, but, before you go, I'm just curious, you've been, you've been in a position to talk, to, interact with and even play with a lot of phenomenal people over your lifetime, of all of them. What's, what's a highlight moment that you could share? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>Wow. I would say there's probably, Hmm, I would, there's probably a couple, but one of the big highlights is working with Tom Waits, in this case, working as a drummer or a percussionist, mostly because he's a songwriter. He is a very traditional songwriter, and he's got a very, you know, very listenable sound. But when you go work with him, he's, he doesn't have a plan. He has a song in his head, and he only knows when something is working or not. So it's like, you go in there, he's got this room full of gear, percussion gear, and you set, you know, I remember one, one session, I had two marching bass drums leaning on my legs. <laugh>, right. One <span style="color:red" data-ts="2760.845" data-end_ts="2760.925" title="2760.845" id=c_"2760.845">__on__</span> each leg. Right. Two giant, two giant xlophone to the, to the left and right of me and some other weird drum in between us. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>And we ended up with this really weird mark, you know, kind of like four, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2772.325" data-end_ts="2772.605" title="2772.325" id=c_"2772.325">__four__</span> rhythm with me kind of jumping around between all three of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2775.485" data-end_ts="2775.565" title="2775.485" id=c_"2775.485">__those__</span>, all five of those instruments. And it took all day to get that. But it was improvisation. It was like, you know, we, we, he'd sing the song and we'd try a version and it's like, listen to the tape and go, eh, it's almost there. But it was, but his, his mind is so open to stuff, you know, he'll change a word, he'll change the shape of the, of the, of the, chorus or whatever just to get to a certain thing. And yet it's more, it's more free improv than having worked with some of the jazz based artists. So I, you know, I, every time I've worked with him, it's just been a thrill. And the same with Anthony Braxton. You know, I, I would think he comes up, he has these amazingly complex orchestral pieces, you know, for all the basic instruments. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2818.605" data-end_ts="2818.805" title="2818.605" id=c_"2818.605">__And__</span> he'll come in and I'm the drummer. He'll, he'll hand me the trumpet part, Uhhuh <laugh>, and I'm on drum set, you know, and he, you know, and he doesn't want me to play the trumpet part. He wants me to play, you know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The part with, with the trumpet part. Yeah. Right. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>Sure. You know, and it's great. I mean, it's just like, it's so, it anti music school where, you know, there's only, you know, wherever you go, there's always one play, one way to play trumpet. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know, like, so-and-So the Great trumpet, one way to play violin here, he's saying, look, express yourself. Here's one part of this larger piece, and I invited you to play. I want you to express yourself with this notated music. If you play a mistake, I'm not interested in a mistake. I want you to express yourself. You know, he says, if you, if you didn't play any mistakes, you played the piece wrong. That's his, it's usually his comment. Oh my God. How, how freeing is that to be? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>How amazing is 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>That? Right. You know? Yeah, I know. And his music, he plays at a very high level. So I, you know, those two experience have, I still think about that when I have students who get, you know, overly, you know, overly precious about their playing. You know, if I have a drum student, you know, first thing I say is I take away the high hat <laugh>. How can I play without the high hat? What <span style="color:red" data-ts="2891.385" data-end_ts="2891.465" title="2891.385" id=c_"2891.385">__is__</span> my left foot gonna do? <laugh>? Like, you know, you're not thinking your left foot's on automatic pilots. Right. So we're gonna take that shit out. Now you've gotta think about the rest of the music, how you fit in. You know, people sometimes forget about that. They're just reading notes on a page. Yeah. Hoping the composer figured that out. But you really have to, you know, so anyways, that's, to answer your question, those two guys I think really took me over the edge a couple 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Times. Sure. That's a couple of great stories and it sounds like great experiences. I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2920.745" data-end_ts="2920.945" title="2920.745" id=c_"2920.745">__wanna__</span> thank you for sharing that, sharing, your background and some of the way you think about things. I really do wanna get you back again soon. And, also hopefully I'll see you over at NAMM this year. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>Yeah. Where will I find you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm not actually working at a booth, but I am sure I'll be, I'll be spending plenty of time over in modular world. I always, I always try to <laugh>, so there's that. Great. Alright. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>I'll see you over there then. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright, sounds good. See you then. Bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gino: </b>Okay. Thanks for the call. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thanks again to Gino for spending the time with us, having a great conversation. Hope you learned as much as I did. I wanna thank you for listening, for continuing to spread the word and, I'll catch you next time or around. Thanks. Bye.
