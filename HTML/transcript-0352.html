    <h3>Released: March 28, 2021</h3>

      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Okay today, I have the great, opportunity to revisit a discussion with a friend. His name is Tony Rolando You will know him as, the chief designer and bottle washer over at Make Noise music. I am such a fan of their work. They recently came out with a new product called the Strega, which we are going to talk a little bit about. But, since we last talked the ***Zero Cost*** had just been released. And so an awful lot of new things have come out of Make Noise since then. And so we're going to touch base on all of those, as well as talking a little bit about Tony's personal work. So with all that introduction gone, let's say hello to Tony. Hey Tony, how are you</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Thanks a lot for taking time out of your schedule to have a talk. I am sure you are swamped. You have this new product called the Strega. That's probably just rolling off the production lines now, right? For people who aren't familiar, why don't you give us a quick overview of what the Strega is?</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tony: </b>
      Ah, okay. Well, the Strega is a small instrument in the same form factor as the Zero Coast that I collaborated, or I should say, Make Noise collaborated with the artist ***Alessandro Cortini*** in developing. And the idea was to develop an instrument that was unique within the Make Noise product line. I think because it was developed for ***Alessandro*** more than anything else. So there was a certain amount of freedom that came with that because it could kind of stand outside of all the other circuits that we have, and be kind of unique from them. So it was kind of a fun opportunity to explore some things that maybe we wouldn't usually do under the guise of well, Hey, ***Alessandro*** wanted this. So if this is upsetting you, talk to ***Cortini***. Okay.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tony: </b>
      So it was an incredible experience. I mean, for one, I have been a fan of ***Cortini's*** music for a long time. And then additionally I was lucky enough to become friends with him. And so it was cool to just develop something with a friend who also just has such a strong vision for, not just music, but also the instruments that he uses to createn his music with. So yeah, this wasn't a case where we made something and then we said, Hey, let's get ***Alessandro*** to endorse this or put his name on it. It was something where we spent two years going back and forth trying to come up with somec kind of a instrument that we could both be excited about. And that also just spoke to his aesthetics, while retaining some Make Noise aesthetics. So a lot of compromises, a lot of deals were struck. A lot of ideas were crushed. Also some ideas were conceived. So it was a long process purely because you had kind of two strong headed people trying to create something together. It was a very fun process, I would say because he is someone that I really liked his music. So I really wanted to make something that he would be excited about.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Sure. That had to be a trip to being able to dive into his brain and try and pull out what he wanted for instrumentation. Now, I've watched a number of videos about the Strega so far. And if I were to like categorize, what is it, I would see that it's kind of a warped filter and effects processor. Is that a fair assessment? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tony: </b>
      I think it can be used in that way, for sure. There is an external input. There's also a Strega voice. The tones, Strega tones and tonic controls are so you don't need something external. You don't need an external sound source for it to make noise. It will go on its own. And I think when ***Alessandro*** and I were we're working on it the thing that he pushed for over and over again, was that, obviously it's a kind of echo verb, it's not quite a reverb and definitely not what you would expect from a delay line. So I call it an echo verb. It kind of, in the vein of some of the early reverbs where they were creating them with multi-tap delay lines and whatnot. What ***Cortini*** kept pushing for was for the echo to be a part of the synthesis engine, as opposed to the echo being end of chain on the instrument. As in like, Oh, we have a synthesizer with a delay line at the end of it.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tony: </b>
      So where the delay line is kind of makes it a little unique in that way. For example, the delay controls are not at the very right most, you know, the very end of the actual instrument interface they're in the center. And then also circuit wise, the delay line is not at the very end of the signal path either, the filter is. Actually, the more think of it there's a lot of things out of order. So typically you would have your ***BCO VCF, VCA,*** and then if you're lucky the ***lay line***, obviously not on the ***Mini Moog***, but say something like the ***Corg DW 8,000, VCO, VCF, VCA, delay line***. So this would be more like a ***VCO ,VCA, delay line, echo verb, filter. So kind of a strange rearrangement of things. And mostly just for the reason of creating, something where the delay line is integral to the synthesis process so much so that the blend knob originally did not go to full dry. And I only changed that after a few people made a little bit of a complaint about it, I still don't know how I feel about it. For me I don't know why you would ever want to run it full dry, but the option is there now. It was not originally though.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i> So first of all, I would say that maybe one of the reasons why I imagined it as a processor is because you identified it. I'm so used to seeing things go into a specific left to right order. And seeing that delay lab knob in the middle makes me say, well, this must be a delay, you know? So making that delayed or that echo verb be part of the synth engine, how much are you dependent then on like feedback within all that front end circuitry in order to make it have the sound it has? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tony: </b>
      There's a lot of feedback paths. In fact, one of the biggest struggles in quality control testing for us. With a digital device it's very easy the feedback paths are coded and precise. It's either there or not, either the firmware loaded and it's running or it's not running, but in this case there's any number of components that could be fractures or be placed improperly or something to where you might lose one of the many feedback paths. I think there's about 13, I'd have to go back and count. There was like 13 different feedback paths happening inside there, and some of them are under voltage control with the decay parameter, but not all of them. Some of them are just hard wired and then others are affected by other parameters on the device.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tony: </b>
      So it is really hard to test them all. And we actually had to develop this kind of weird set of test points, that was quite frustrating. It actually took quite a long time to actually come up with a testing procedure for it. So yeah, it does rely quite a bit on the feedback, now that you mentioned it. I mean, there's feedback paths that go obviously, all the way around, from almost the output back to the input. But then there's also feedback paths that happened in front of the filter, feedback paths that happened inside the filter. So there's about 13 different ones and they're all in different places and they all kind of have different jobs. Like some of them are what create more discernible repeats, the echos. Others create resonances, like really short delay lines to give the filter comb filtering. It kind of gives it a more smeary, reverberant quality as opposed to just echo.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>So the process of developing this with ***Alessandro*** sounds like it would have been quite a task because what you're talking about really extends a long ways past, can you take this and add this and then put it in a box? It seems like it's a lot. It is sort of almost like classic instrument building. And I'm wondering what was the process? How did you make modules and like have a whole bunch of modules wired together and then use that? Did you mock it up in software? How did you make prototypes that could even test out some of the ideas that you guys were coming up with? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tony: </b>
      Yeah, so the first step was drawing it out just by hand, and we did this while I was in Berlin a few times for Super Booth actually. I would go to ***Alessandro's*** apartment. We would hang out and he would draw stuff and I would draw stuff. And we kind of came up with an idea for a layout, like an ideal layout that could fit a form factor that we were happy with. At that point it was very pie in the sky, like anything's possible. And there was a lot of functionalities that didn't make it to the final version. And then there was a point where I just had to kind of jump right in and I used a breadboard, actually several breadboards, it was like three bread boards. And it was just a mess of a jumper wires. I'm sure you're familiar with these, you just plug them in. They're like almost like miniature patch cables, except they don't work as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tony: </b>
      They're very intermittent, you know, you bumped the table and something comes undone. At that point, ***Alessandro*** actually came to Asheville. I think it was through either one or two weeks. It might've been like a week and a half and we would literally just sit in my office, and obviously this is well before pandemic times, we would sit in my office and he would play it and he would have comments about the sound or the functionality. He would ask for things to be more or less, brighter or darker, longer or shorter. Then I would go and I would literally be changing resistors and capacitors values, moving feedback loops around in real time. And then he would play it some more and then he would have more comments and I would move stuff around some more.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tony: </b>
      So that went on for like a week and a half of just breadboarding basically, real-time performance slash breadboarding. We had it hooked up into a set of studio monitors in the office and he would just play it and listen. And tell me what he liked, what he didn't like, what it needed, what it was missing, what it had too much of, all the stuff. There was just a very short distance between his feedback and the changes because we could both be in the same room and it was on a breadboard. Breadboards are awful things obviously, but they're also amazing thing.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tony: </b>
      So after that period of development, we were pretty close. I mean we had something, there was enough there that I could commit it to a printed circuit board. And so I like to move as fast as possible from breadboard to printed circuit board for analog designs, just for the reasons mentioned. You can't really move them around too easily. So things like, Hey, what does this sound like if we run it through this other thing? Well, we'll have to bring that other thing here because I'm not going to put this to the car and drive to my friend's house because it won't work when we get there. So we committed as quickly as possible to print a circuit board. And at that point we could start mailing stuff back and forth between Berlin and Asheville. Which takes a little longer, but has the advantage of him being able to use it in his studio with all his other instruments and over his monitoring system that he's accustomed to.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tony: </b>
      So once we got him <span style="color:red" data-ts="816.51" data-end_ts="816.66" title="816.51" id=c_"816.51">__an__</span> actual working units, we sent him those units and he could actually play them in his studio, in his, his
      actual process. And then it comes a time of, you know, thanking our FedEx basically for doing overnight shipping from Berlin to Asheville, where he would say, okay, this and this, and this are great, but there's this problem with the external
      input. And we would say, great, we'll figure it out overnight him a modified circuit. He would overnight us the other prototype back. We've modified that one begin the whole process again. So there was a lot of FedEx overnight shipping at that
      point.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Right. Well, that's, that's, interesting and amazing story. And it kind of, I was gonna say initially that, that it's a break from how you work, except these kind of, it's not because this sort of collaborative thing is what
        you've been doing with Tom Erbe for quite a while. Exactly. And so this is just sort of like extending it a little bit and maybe letting somebody else, in the, in the room, in the design room, I guess. Right? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tony: </b>Yeah, absolutely. Tom is a wonderful collaborator. And, the process is, is not really that different because like Alessandro, Tom is, he has strong aesthetics. Tom has strong ideas about how things sound or should sound or how he
      will make them sound. And so there is a lot of, it's not just us saying, Tom, do this, it's us saying, Tom, do this and him saying, that's not how I would quite want to do that. Let me tell you how I would like to <span style="color:red"
        data-ts="919.55" data-end_ts="919.61" title="919.55" id=c_"919.55">__do__</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>That. Sounds very much like Tom. Right. And he just said that the way you said that that's great. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tony: </b>He has wonderful aesthetics. So the end results are great.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>I th right. I was just going to say, when you see the results, it makes it pretty easy to trust his vision, right? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tony: </b>Yeah. A hundred percent. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Tom, the only, the only thing I ever would fault Tom for is he always pushes everything to the, to the upper limits. So any, any, technology that we're using, if it can go to, if it
      can go to 110, he's at 109.9, he just pushes everything to the absolute maximum capabilities. He doesn't leave any window. It's funny because every year new technology comes out as you know, every year and we'll adapt it from time to time. And
      then I'll always think we have more power for now, you know, once he gets this in his hands, we'll be waiting for the next <span style="color:red" data-ts="980.65" data-end_ts="981.01" title="980.65" id=c_"980.65">__bomb__</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i><span style="color:red" data-ts="981.37" data-end_ts="981.49" title="981.37" id=c_"981.37">__Yeah__</span>. Anxious for the next right. You know, in talking about Tom, some of the stuff that he came up with since the last time
        we talked, key among them is the Morphagene, which is kind of at the heart of an awful lot of people's modular studios now, but it really comes, it, it kind of extends the aesthetic of like the tape music, culture, and music and crept stuff
        that, you kind of started with the phoner gene, but we are actually discussed as part of, our previous conversation that, that, finding information about the old tape studios and music concrete was something that you ran across in, in the New
        York libraries and was really influential to you. Now you're at the point where you're actually making systems that are sort of like <span style="color:red" data-ts="1034.47" data-end_ts="1034.83" title="1034.47"
          id=c_"1034.47">__tape__</span> music studios in a box. Right? Yeah. How do, how does that feel? And, and how does, how does that kind of aesthetic drives some of your design decisions? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tony: </b>Well, it feels, it feels awesome because it's something that I was excited about. And interestingly enough, I recently returned to actual tape loops for briefly, briefly, I would say, I mean, while it is, it is incredibly fun and
      tap tack out to actually cut a loop and, you know, the Mark stuff up with grease pencils and then, you know, live with the happy accidents that occurred from time to time. But the whole process takes so much longer what you can do with
      something like a tape or micro sound, or, I mean, for that matter, countless matched devices is just incredible. And so to have something that's physical that has like the tactile you'll have cutting loops on a tape machine, just because it is
      physical and there's buttons, you can press and so on, but has also some of the benefits of, of, of digital sound manipulation is it's, it's a, it's a great thing.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tony: </b>It was definitely a goal of mine to create something like that. I didn't think I'd ever actually be able to do it, but it's great. Great to have it. And it's fun to, I mean, it's just fun to play with. I mean, you don't, even if
      you're not creating music that you're going to try to release into the world, you're just having fun, cutting up YouTube clips that you've sampled. I mean, I spent so much time just sampling, like, you know, sampling the president or something
      and just, you know, patching around and having fun with that. So, yeah, it feels wonderful. And as far as like design aesthetics in future designs, I think, yeah, that's, that's, that's a harder one. I feel like modular informed so much about,
      obviously something like the tape <span style="color:red" data-ts="1146.18" data-end_ts="1146.27" title="1146.18" id=c_"1146.18">__of__</span> micro sound or the Morphagene or the phone or gene, there was this idea, you know, obviously granular
      synthesis has existed in computer format for so long, but one of the things I always felt was I could achieve really interesting results, but I always felt like there was something between myself and the digital audio.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tony: </b>I never felt like, Hey, I always wanted to just kind of reach in and make something happen, but it was never quite as easy as that. And so I think modular kind of lends itself to that like really direct input from the human, this
      needs to be slower. Like, okay, you reach in there, grab the various speed knob and slow it down. And so I think modular, like analog modular informs things more than anything in what we do and what I think most of our contemporaries and, and
      Eurorack do just because it's just, that's what makes it special is, is having all those patch points and the knobs and buttons and making something very direct and fully able to be implemented by the human in real time, as opposed to something
      that has to be kind of pre-programmed or, I guess something that lives behind that wall that is the computer screen. Not that there's anything wrong with that, because obviously computers can do a great bit more than any, modular synthesizer
      system, but there's always still that wall and you have to either embrace it and live with it, or you have to get, you know, you have to walk away from it and get in front of a modular or something like that.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Well, I think there's actually a little bit to a difference in physics too, right? I mean, a feedback loop in the analog world is just simply different than a feedback world, you know? And so from that standpoint, it's, it's,
        there, there are differences that will always exist in all Make. I think analog always be an important part of, of music making in studios. Now you are in the kind of unique position, I think, you know, certainly from our listeners
        standpoint, you are in a completely unique position in probably being able to have as large of a Make Noise modular system as you would like. But, I'm curious, you kind of dropped a little hint there about cutting up tapes and stuff.
        Obviously you're not just a pure electronics designer, you're a musician too. You bring the musician aesthetic to the design that you make. What is music making like for you? What's your studio setup kind of like, tell me a little bit about
        the music you make and how you do it. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tony: </b>Sure. Yeah. I find that, that, I do, yeah, I do obviously have a Make Noise system in there. I have a shared system and then I have another case that's like a seven year case that has a bunch of the stuff <span style="color:red"
        data-ts="1316.01" data-end_ts="1316.13" title="1316.01" id=c_"1316.01">__it's__</span> not in a shared system, quad multimodal gate <span style="color:red" data-ts="1319.1" data-end_ts="1319.34" title="1319.1" id=c_"1319.1">__Rick's__</span>
      mix and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1320.27" data-end_ts="1321.02" title="1320.27" id=c_"1320.27">__mg__</span>, a few other things. And so that's like in one corner right now, this situation is, that's, that's in one corner with, with, an
      <span style="color:red" data-ts="1328.58" data-end_ts="1328.76" title="1328.58" id=c_"1328.58">__ARP__</span> 2,600 behind it. I really liked, I really liked the sound of the art. It has wonderful sounding, really snappy envelopes that I think
      pair well with, with, with the Make Noise system and with a lot of other modular sounds, I guess, yeah, just such beautiful snappy envelopes. And then I also love the, the dual spring tank that's in that machine is just a wonderful thing that
      honestly, I spent a lot of patches are just running out of Make Noise system into that, of the art to get that spring reverb sometimes even like <span style="color:red" data-ts="1364.49" data-end_ts="1364.78" title="1364.49"
        id=c_"1364.49">__herb__</span> verb into spring reverb.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tony: </b>So, yeah. So that's one little corner right now. And then, on the other wall, I have a poly sense. Yeah. I got kind of back into those last year and, I did a whole record that has, has a ton of polysubstance on it. One of my
      favorite ones is that Oberheim eight. Mm. Really, really like, and I've, haven't really ever found another one that I've played that has quite the drifty, quality that that has. And I kind of just play it like a piano, not well, but like a
      piano. I just liked playing chords on it. I don't program it a whole lot. I have basically just the panel is always just live. I think it's called manual is the manual button and then the knobs are live and it's kind of always on the same basic
      setup. It's just kind of like an analog, a bad analog synth, emulation of a piano it's real drifty and the sustain long. So I really love, I really love that one. And then other stuff that you use a lot, I mean, a lot of stuff just comes and
      goes. I'm trying to think of what else is in there.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Well, other than your experiments with tape loops, do you use tape at all or do you, are you a well-integrated digital recording? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tony: </b>I am a, I fully subscribed to the doll. I, so, so as of last year I started actually recording again and I hadn't really made music in over a decade, probably about 12, 13 years. So I was really far behind and where <span
        style="color:red" data-ts="1457.17" data-end_ts="1457.53" title="1457.17" id=c_"1457.17">__Daws__</span> had gone to, like the dots in me was, like originally it was, you know, like a very, like very primitive version of Cubase and then
      followed by of course pro tools because that's just what everyone used in the nineties and the early two thousands <span style="color:red" data-ts="1471.72" data-end_ts="1471.9" title="1471.72" id=c_"1471.72">__end__</span> of the nineties,
      early two thousands. And so pro tools is it's a defined way to record, but it's a little bit, I mean, it's kind of just a digital tape machine. And you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1481.47" data-end_ts="1481.65" title="1481.47"
        id=c_"1481.47">__I'd__</span> heard from our customers about Appleton live quite a bit. All of our, so many of our customers use Appleton live.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tony: </b>And, I was, able to, you know, because Appleton, I guess they, they like Make Noise because they given us some installs to use for videos and stuff. And I got one of those installs and started learning about Appleton and I kind of
      fell in love with it. It's such a wonderful software because it's sort of like a, like a SIM a door that's designed like a synthesizer. If that makes sense. It's just, it's very fun to play. And I found myself, I don't really use any of the
      software sensor or anything. I'm mostly just used the arrangement, view the window where you can see the, yeah. The linear view. I don't really ever use the other view. I only use the linear view, but I just find it once, you know, you capture
      things. It's just, there's so much fun that can be had with them, with what you capture from the analog world inside the digital world using Appleton. So, and I've started to explore max for live as well, which is like this incredible, like
      alternate universe of like different.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>I was going to say, beware, man, it's crazy </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tony: </b>Funny. I had like this crazy idea one day to hook up. I thought it was crazy. I was like, there's no way anyone makes this, I wanted to play a stack of four, zero coast. You know, you talked about, you know, at being an owner of
      Make Noise, I can have as much Make Noise as I'd like. So I borrowed four, zero <span style="color:red" data-ts="1575.1" data-end_ts="1575.45" title="1575.1" id=c_"1575.1">__coast__</span> and I wanted to play them polyphonically and I thought,
      I wonder if anyone's made a device that would let me do that with ease. I go search on the max for live library and sure enough, there's a device it's like, it was like $5 and it lets you set up, you know, basically like round Robin voice
      sharing amongst multiple mini devices. And I created a polyphonic zero coasts.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Yeah. Yeah. Basically you, you made a cork model poly. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tony: </b>Exactly. Yeah. That is exactly what it was, because it was like the monopod, like in that you had independent controls for each voice and they all, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1611.66" data-end_ts="1611.84" title="1611.66"
        id=c_"1611.66">__who__</span> could make them sound different. So each note would play differently. But I mean, that's just kind of the wonderful thing about Appleton and mass for live and just being able to have some kind of crazy idea. And
      then there's almost, it's almost like the software is out there to kind of help you achieve these crazy ideas. I mean, they might end up not really being good ideas, but at least you got to explore them.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Right? Yeah. It's supposed to, and it's funny, you mentioned that for you, it feels like kind of like a synth. I feel like they've done something in their design where everybody feels a connection to some part of the software.
        So some people say, you know, I come from using loopers and there's a part of it that really feels like it was influenced by loopers and others. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1657.73" data-end_ts="1657.85" title="1657.73"
          id=c_"1657.73">__He__</span> will say it about sense or other people say about, you know, different, different functions. And, I think it's really neat how it's an, it's the kind of a canvas that people can really take their experiences and
        kind of projected on there. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tony: </b>Yeah. I think you're right there. I have another friend locally here who is, he's like a jazz kind of a jazz saxophone player, but he loves loopers and he has this whole Ableton set that he's developed or I guess it would be
      session. I came through the proper terminology, but it's like, like when he brings up Ableton, he has this whole set of like crazy complicated Looper. And, but I mean, when you see him recording with it, it works perfectly for me as like a
      racket bloopers in front of him, but it's just on his laptop works very well for him, but yeah, I think, yeah, Appleton or Ableton, I guess it kind of sparked me in a way. And I just have a lot of fun being able to capture things from the
      modular or from whatever synthesize or whatever instruments I have that are inspiring me at the moment.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tony: </b>I'd like to change things up. So while <span style="color:red" data-ts="1723.85" data-end_ts="1723.97" title="1723.85" id=c_"1723.85">__the__</span> Make Noise system, I also have a tape, a micro sound system in there. And then of
      course I have the Strega zero <span style="color:red" data-ts="1729.88" data-end_ts="1730.18" title="1729.88" id=c_"1729.88">__Coastie__</span> or control that sits on the right side of my desk. Some things don't change, but other things kind
      of come and go, like there was a DX seven in there for a while trying to think of other things. I got some other modules that come and go, right now I'm really enjoying the Noise engineering reverb. And I'm not going to try to remember the name
      of it, but it's
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Yeah. I, I can never remember any of them. Right. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tony: </b>That river sounds wonderful. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1755.35" data-end_ts="1755.47" title="1755.35" id=c_"1755.35">__Have__</span> an enjoying that right now. There's also a Digi tone in there, which I really like. I've
      been enjoying that one quite a bit, but I never, I don't use it. I only, I don't use it as like a groove box as much as, just as like a synthesizer and it always gets run out of the digital and into the modular or into the art. It sounds great
      running it into the art, through the filters and the herbs. And then, I, I recently really got a, this is going to be super nerdy, but, I had previously avoided it, but I got really into, compression. So I've been experimenting a lot with
      different, analog compressors. The difference between like <span style="color:red" data-ts="1794.28" data-end_ts="1794.94" title="1794.28" id=c_"1794.28">__outboard__</span>, like analog compression and doing compression inside of Ableton is,
      is pretty profound. And also, I think recording with it in chain is kind of incredible.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tony: </b>It makes you play the instruments a little differently and you can really kind of focus on elements of the sound that you maybe wouldn't have noticed or would have been kind of lost previously. So yeah, like, have like a, some
      different, like a fat compressor and I've got a dial bridge compressor that's really cool sounding. And so those things have kind of opened up the synthesizer sounds even more. And I think recording something like a digital phone into, into
      like an herb verb into like an art 2,600 filter followed by a spring reverb into like a fat compressor kind of ends up kind of starts to really get you sparked and like excited about the quality of the sound as well as the notes that you've
      chosen to play.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Well, I think it's, you bring up an interesting point too, which is compression is one of those things where I think, I think compression after the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1852.59" data-end_ts="1853.22"
          title="1852.59" id=c_"1852.59">__DAC__</span> is so much different than before the DAC. And, and I think that, I think it's when I, when I talk to people and they're like, yeah, I want to put together a studio, you know what, and I want to
        do it all in a box. I'm like, for the most part, you'll probably do fine, but you know, there, there are some things that, that you're going to miss out on and the kind of tweaky Mike pre-IND compare compressor things can really make an
        extraordinary difference in the quality. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tony: </b>Yeah. And it can just excite you. Yeah, exactly. It can be, you know, like in recording studios, a lot of times I think like they'll record a vocal dry, obviously, but in the vocalist headphone, mixed up, <span style="color:red"
        data-ts="1897.99" data-end_ts="1898.22" title="1897.99" id=c_"1897.99">__put__</span> like a nice river where an echo on it and it can kind of change how the singer will approach it. I kind of feel like that's the same is true of recording
      synthesizers. If you get a sound and it's good, and then you make it even better before you record it, you might play it a little differently, do something differently, or push, push the levels and push the envelope a little bit, a little bit
      more is that first record that I finished, which I think will be coming out in March, but I haven't really heard anything from the label in a minute. So I should probably check in with them for that one. I didn't, it was all in the box. I
      didn't have any of this, these wonderful analog processors. So, but I did have lots of wonderful analog synthesizers around and, and it was still extremely fun to make. And then I have a second one that's coming out this fall that I'm maybe a
      little more excited about, but you know, just, just because it's like the more recent one, you know?

      <b>Darwin: </b><i>I know it's, it's hilarious. You say that because I, my, my recollection of like, when I was in my teens is that I would get on somebody. And then it was a process of scouring, my little corner of the world, looking for the
        rest of the things. And it was hard sometimes even finding out what were the releases that people did right now. It's not now you can just go to a streaming service and not only find out what they did, but here at all, immediately. It's
        really weird. </i>

      <b>Tony: </b>Exactly. Right. Yeah. Yeah. You do. Yeah. You didn't even know how many records of particular artists might've made and you might be surprised when you walked into a record store, you might find something that you need to know
      existed. Yeah, exactly. Like, Oh, they made this ever even seen this before.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b><i>So getting back to the modular business, I'm a little curious about, again, talking about your design process. I am fascinated by people's stories about how they do design and stuff like that. And, and you've been really open
        about it, but one of the things that I went and listened to, before our interview, I went and listened to the interview we did in 2016. And one of the things that you talked a lot about was the influence of booklet and booklet design, and
        book ideas, getting pictures of the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2251.88" data-end_ts="2252.33" title="2251.88" id=c_"2251.88">__booklet__</span> modules and like pouring over them and imagining in your head what the must sound like. Now
        you have to be fishing beyond that. I mean, the Strega is a clear example. There, there is no parallel of that in the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2269.91" data-end_ts="2270.3" title="2269.91" id=c_"2269.91">__Buka__</span> world at all.
        And frankly, a number of the things I can Morphagene in the mimicry, Mimi <span style="color:red" data-ts="2274.8" data-end_ts="2275.16" title="2274.8" id=c_"2274.8">__font__</span> and stuff like that. There's no equivalent. So you're
        obviously stretching beyond, what you poured over in bookclub documentation. Right? What is it now that you find inspiring? What are the things that you use to stimulate ideas to, to get your kind of juices flowing to get you revved up about
        the idea of doing a design? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tony: </b>Well, I think that was for the Strega was Alessandro. It was Cortini. And I think that he and I have discussed doing another project together and that'll probably be the next project that I work on will be another project with him
      in his vision of, I guess. Yeah. I mean, it's interesting because you're what you're saying is that initially it was non-available hardware, legendary mysterious hardware. And it was, it was, I mean, I, and I don't think I was, I don't think I
      was unique in that, in that way. I think a lot of us were pouring over these pictures. I know, I know Scott Jaeger over at, industrial music, electronics, AKA, harvest man. He did the same thing. I mean, we, we would talk about it. We would
      talk about what do you think <span style="color:red" data-ts="2348.41" data-end_ts="2348.56" title="2348.41" id=c_"2348.41">__there's__</span> Boogaloo module D

      <b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Fast,

    <p>
      <b>Tony: </b>You know, the blue knobs, the fonts, everything about it, just gorgeous. So you're like, Oh, but you've never used it. You never even stayed in the same room as it. So it had this mystery to it. And now of course also there's a lot
      of, you know, you can own a Marc clone. That's pretty close to the original and you can play one. And, and, and I've actually had the opportunity to play some of the originals, thanks to Allesandro. Letting me hang out in his studio and, and
      play with an original music easel or an original, a 200 system. And so I think, yeah, maybe a little, like I'm not looking to, to, you know, obscure hardware anymore. I think I'm looking to someone like an, like an artist, like Alessandro or,
      in some ways I think Tom and I are kind of trying to figure out, you know, where are we going to go next? Where, where we're going to seek inspiration from it's a long process with him. And I, especially right now, I think because he's, he's
      quite busy at school due to the pandemic. I think a lot of, a lot of, responsibilities fell on him as far as like getting remote learning set up. You can imagine

      question because I can't give you a 100% certain answer. I think I am currently searching. And I think part of that search has been returning to the actual music <span style="color:red" data-ts="2472.03" data-end_ts="2472.45" title="2472.03"
        id=c_"2472.03">__Mason__</span> making process that brought me to modular in the first place. And I've spent the last year. I mean, I record almost every day now. Whereas prior to that, I mean, like I said, I had over a decade of, I didn't
      even have an audio interface in my room. I just didn't record. I didn't, you know, making music was something I would do in my office while I was developing a new product.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tony: </b>And I did it often. I mean, I'm always making sound, I'm always making noise in the office, but there's a difference. There's a difference between staying up until 2:00 AM trying to capture the perfect take of some, some sound that
      you created on a synthesizer and, you know, hanging out in your office, trying to make a circuit work as well as possible. Right? They're both musical, they're both musical endeavors, but I feel like our, our customer base and people who are
      using Make nobodies are probably more likely to be up until 2:00 AM trying to figure out how to get the perfect capturing of that sound created. And it's just, that's more of, that's why they bought their Make Noise in the first place. That's
      why they bought the synthesizer in the first place. So I'm kind of returning to that. And then I'm finding it. That's kind of guiding me quite a bit and I'm kind of, I'm borrowing every instrument that I can.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tony: </b>I just borrowed from a friend of mine. I'm lucky enough to have a lot of friends in music. We do swaps a friend of mine up the road. He has a studio in town. It's a wonderful studio called drop a son. He's actually recording, some,
      well, actually I probably shouldn't say he's recording right now. I'm not supposed to, but, we always exchange stuff. So right now he has my PPG and I have his mode one. So I'm exploring a mode one. Yeah. We do fun stuff like that. And I find
      that that's kind of, you know, that's kind of, going at things from a musician perspective of once again is kind of rekindling my interest in a big way. And I'm also, I just, I want to work with some more musicians. I want to work some more
      with Cortini and I have ideas for other people that I wanna work with and they don't know it yet, but,

      concerned throughout the whole process that at some point he was just going to say, I was going to call him on the phone. And he was going to say, you know, Tony, if done <span style="color:red" data-ts="2614.57" data-end_ts="2614.72"

      <b>Tony: </b>I just, cause it was taking so damn long. And then, and, and you know, the cool thing is that he, he didn't say that, you know, he was committed to seeing it through. And, and I think it was probably hard for him because I think he
      probably learned a lot about just how many steps go into bringing an instrument to the market and for when you're on the receiving end, you're like, Oh, this wonderful thing has arrived and you're not seeing all the, and I'm sure it's the same
      with, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2650.96" data-end_ts="2651.29" title="2650.96" id=c_"2650.96">__yeah__</span>, I know it's the same with, with software when the new version comes out, everyone goes in, immediately downloads it and loves

        loved this collaboration with you. So it was clearly a fantastic experience for him as well. </i>

      <b>Tony: </b>Yeah. I'm glad to hear that. I was glad to, I mean, I was definitely, like I said, I was worried at times it's, it's a different place for a musician to be in the world of design and manufacturer. It's a very different place. There
      can be some moments that are crushing. You know, when you have to tell someone, if we do this, it has to be twice as big and twice as expensive. We don't want it to be twice as big and twice as you know, there's like a lot of times where you
      have to think about things in a way that's just not as fun. It's not as beautiful. And, and, yeah, exactly. Practicalities come into play. And as much as I would like to ignore those things, I think at the end of the day, I think our, the
      people who like Make Noise, the customers, the artists that use it are going to appreciate it. Even if they don't know about it there, they will appreciate it because it's the whole reason why it ends up landing in their studios. A lot of times
      is that the practicalities that we take into account in order for something to actually be available?

      <b>Darwin: </b><i>Well, man, I blew past our tiny, no, that's cool. I know it's just the opposite. I, I could, I could do this about like five hours longer. So, so we've just, we've just really started, but, I'm going to have to wrap it up. So
        we are going to have to, hopefully it's not going to be another five years before we talk again for Christ's sake, but it's it was so good to talk to you. Thanks a lot, man. </i>
