<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today I have the great pleasure of getting to meet a couple of new people. I was, turned <span style="color:red" data-ts="19.685" data-end_ts="19.885" title="19.685" id=c_"19.685">__on__</span> to these folks by the whole LA crew. It's, it's funny, everybody brings these two up whenever we talk about modular stuff. And so I was really excited when they agreed to, join me for a, for a chat. I'm talking to Steven McCall and Chris Kaiser from <span style="color:red" data-ts="37.185" data-end_ts="37.405" title="37.185" id=c_"37.185">__No__</span> Engineering. Noise Engineering is one of these sneaky popular companies. It's not one that you necessarily hear a lot of, but whenever you talk to people about what are the things that make up important parts of their rigs or what are their favorite modules, modules by Noise Engineering keeps on coming up. So with that, I'm gonna say hello to Steven and Chris. Hey guys. How are you doing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen McCaul: </b>Hi. Doing good. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thanks a lot for, taking the time outta your schedule. I'm sure you, had to stop like boxing and stickering and, and soldering for a little bit in order to do this. I appreciate you taking the time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>We're really happy to be here. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. For people who aren't familiar with your stuff, and there's not gonna be a lot, but there'll be some, why don't we have you give a really quick tour of what it is that you do? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Okay. So yeah, we are noise engineering. We make URAC modules. The focus of a lot of our modules is actually doing sort of digital, engineering in the Euro space, as well as doing a lot of kind of punky tricks to make our stuff sound cool. We have a lot of modules that are really meant to give you a really wide variety of, of tonality that are all parameter with knobs. And that's something that's really hard to do in <span style="color:red" data-ts="114.825" data-end_ts="115.045" title="114.825" id=c_"114.825">__and__</span> with an analog oscillator and something that digital really excels at. And so that's a large, a large part of our focus is just digital sound generation. And then we have a whole lot of modules that are really meant for live use. They're meant to be small and compact and not universal, but very flexible for making music for how big they are. So that's a whole nother <span style="color:red" data-ts="137.125" data-end_ts="137.445" title="137.125" id=c_"137.125">__class__</span>, like line of modules. We have that rhythm generators and putting out a bunch of CV control stuff this year, and a bunch more rhythm and time control stuff as well that are in that line of products. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Now one of the things that people, even if they don't catch the name of the company as, shagging something outta their brains, as soon as they hear a name of one of your modules, they'll be like, oh, those guys, right, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Yep. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I, I mean, there are a few I could probably make out, but for most part they're, I am not sure where they're coming from. What is a Baulus iterative? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>So the naming, there's a, there's a couple, I guess reasons for the naming. I mean, the first one is just sort of fun. They're not meant to be serious. Some people are almost upset at them, and it's like, these are all meant to be a little bit jokey. I mean, on the website we actually have etymologies for all the word, they're not always true. Sometimes they're intentionally opposite of truth because it's funnier that way. So there's, there's a lot of just sort of tongue in cheek stuff going on. And now we have enough modules. There's sort of an internal vocabulary, like a terra toss is what we use to denote an oscillator. So one of the reasons I liked this scheme, as a good example, our most popular module is the Basim CITAs. And it started life as a drum synthesizer. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>But calling it, that really puts a limit on what it is to people. You know, you give something a name and it tell you what it is, and then also implicitly sort of limits what you, how you think about it. And that module in particular is very versatile. People buy it as a drum and use it as a lead or a baseline all the time because it's really just a small standalone voice. And so I like the idea that the name is not actually limiting how people think about what the module is because of sort of predefined associations with, you know, that are just implicit in any <span style="color:red" data-ts="252.615" data-end_ts="252.735" title="252.615" id=c_"252.615">__time__</span> you give something a name that is from a language that, you know, <laugh>. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kris Kaiser: </b>They're also because of the, the sort of Latin ish, I've used air quotes around that, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="262.795" data-end_ts="263.015" title="262.795" id=c_"262.795">__if__</span>, if you know a little bit of Latin, you can kind of maybe get to what we're getting at with the, the naming. But what's fun about it too is that, you know, every time we do a show, somebody comes up to us and, and pronounces every module differently. Oh, sure. Inhouse, we just kind of call them by their initials. Okay. So theta alter is just the BIA 'cause who has time to say all of those words? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, I hear you. Yeah. The, the tongue twisting would get pretty serious after a while. Sure. Are all of your modules digital? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>No, but mostly, yeah. I mean 80%, 90%. Interesting. That's, I mean, my background is, I spent a very long time writing software, so, but that's sort of just <span style="color:red" data-ts="306.855" data-end_ts="307.055" title="306.855" id=c_"306.855">__what__</span>, you know, my normal wheelhouse is involve software. So being able to put software in a module is just a technical strength of ours. So that's sort of where we ended up finding the most, Hey, to make <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, now you've opened two doors there. I'm gonna take one of 'em and then we'll come back to the second, which is your background. One of the things I love to do in my podcast is talk to people about how they got to where they are. And, I am interested in both of your stories getting some sense of how you get to the point of making much beloved and hard to pronounce <laugh> modules that seemed to have, have captured people's attention. So how, how did you get there? Where did you start? And maybe even before the software thing, how did you get interested in music and musical instrumentation being what you're interested in throwing your software at? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Yep. That's a big question. <laugh> summarize, 40 years. I'll just go quick, quick highlights. Chronologically, I guess. So as a kid, elementary school, I took four years of piano lessons, Suzuki method reads, memorize everything <span style="color:red" data-ts="377.865" data-end_ts="378.085" title="377.865" id=c_"377.865">__you__</span> get to, and then played in, acoustic bass in an orchestra for another four or five years. And at that point in time in my life, I started getting into industrial music. It was became very fascinating synthesizers. And that just <span style="color:red" data-ts="391.385" data-end_ts="391.805" title="391.385" id=c_"391.385">__always__</span> had a, always had a certain natural predilection towards science and engineering, as well, which just made my, I was pretty obsessed with synths back then and I had no money at all. So there was a lot of pawn shop buying of horrible things that were not good, synths and whatnot. Then I went to college to try to become an electrical engineer that didn't pan out for <span style="color:red" data-ts="411.605" data-end_ts="411.725" title="411.605" id=c_"411.605">__a__</span> variety of reasons, at Louisiana Tech. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Actually spent a year there and then moved back to my home, which I did not originally say. But I was actually born in, in the middle of nowhere in Arkansas. But then I spent eight years in and out of college basically spending most of my free time writing music and then working in various tech jobs for eight years. <span style="color:red" data-ts="432.865" data-end_ts="433.085" title="432.865" id=c_"432.865">__At__</span> some point I got sick of not having a degree and decided I needed to get one, decided that I needed something that was challenging 'cause I was really bored of school and it's a lot of my in and out with it, and decided to get a math degree because that would be difficult and universally applicable. So then I got a math degree at that point, I got a job doing more software development. <span style="color:red" data-ts="450.785" data-end_ts="451.005" title="450.785" id=c_"450.785">__Was__</span> was a nice job, but it was pretty boring as well. Actually we're on mainframes, so I was actually, it was very retro. One thing just to just give an idea of how strange that world is. So at some point I had to make a computer boot for Linux on virtual punch cards because those operating systems on the, still thinking about things in terms of punch cards, even though they don't, they're not physical anymore, but the software still has to be on punch cards in some, some virtual way. That's, they were IBM Big Iron mainframes. That's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>How I got started too. The virtual punch card made my ass Twitch just a little bit when you mentioned it. So sorry. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b><laugh>. Yep. Yeah. I was like, okay. So I kinda got bored with that as well. It was interesting and I certainly learned a lot of strange <span style="color:red" data-ts="496.825" data-end_ts="497.045" title="496.825" id=c_"496.825">__tri__</span> about mainframes at that point. I decided to do something very different and get out of the town. I was still in Arkansas at that point. I kind of wanted to leave. And so I ended up going to a newly hatched graduate program for video game development in at SMU, called the Guild Hall. 'cause it kind of made sense 'cause I've always been kind of a multidisciplinary guy. And games are just deeply multidisciplinary. Like, you need to be technical, you need to be creative, you have to be able to talk to, <span style="color:red" data-ts="523.025" data-end_ts="523.245" title="523.025" id=c_"523.025">__are__</span> people who are, have a very different mindset than you, to be productive. So I, I went through that program. It was, say, two years of very intense work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>And then right after that, got a job out here in la working for <span style="color:red" data-ts="536.595" data-end_ts="537.085" title="536.595" id=c_"536.595">__Triarch__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="537.265" data-end_ts="537.485" title="537.265" id=c_"537.265">__and__</span> then proceeded to spend the next 10 years in the video game industry doing audio software development for video games, essentially. It was a good time, but I kind of got burnt out. Game industry, particularly at the high end of it, is a very stressful, very, you don't have a life for years at a time earlier in my life, it was fun. And now I need a little bit of free time, and a little bit more relaxing. And I'm, you know, and working on a 200 person project is just, even if it goes as well as it can go, it's always a mess just because there's so much complexity with any sort of project of that scale. So, oh, I should back up. Not quite there yet. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>The, during this time, I, I was basically working with sound designers. My sort of main position was I was one of two engineers whose job was just to support nine or 10 sound designers. So if they needed something, done some software, written some tools, made better new runtime features in the game, then I would be one of the people that would develop them. And so we, you know, my day-to-Day interaction was with sound designers on that job. And I of course made a lot of friends with those guys. And one of them a few years ago had gotten into <span style="color:red" data-ts="606.085" data-end_ts="606.205" title="606.085" id=c_"606.085">__U__</span> Rack, had bought a nice little system. And I hadn't seen, like years and years ago in the, like early two thousands, I had a roommate that had a pretty large <span style="color:red" data-ts="615.505" data-end_ts="615.725" title="615.505" id=c_"615.505">__fer__</span> system. And that was the last time I had seen modular. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>And this, the modules that my friend Sean bought were like a completely different <span style="color:red" data-ts="626.235" data-end_ts="626.435" title="626.235" id=c_"626.235">__breed__</span>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="626.595" data-end_ts="626.715" title="626.595" id=c_"626.595">__'cause__</span> they were this, you know, the modern, this was five, six years ago, sort of when the urac, you know, rebirth was happening. And things are really getting exciting. And there were a lot of really interesting ideas and, and new ideas and not just, you know, old analog stuff, <laugh>, like so much the older URAC was. Right. And so that got me really interested in the format. Again, I basically bragged to my friend that, oh, I could make, a module. He really wanted a module to make the Atari 2,600 sounds <span style="color:red" data-ts="656.995" data-end_ts="657.115" title="656.995" id=c_"656.995">__a__</span> linear, feedback shift <span style="color:red" data-ts="658.595" data-end_ts="658.955" title="658.595" id=c_"658.595">__measures__</span> for oscillator. They would actually tune. And I was like, that's no problem. I could do that in a, in a weekend. And then he was like, well then do it <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>And so I did, I made a prototype that ended up being the first module we ended up selling for him, that we could, it was, you know, I mean literally super glued together. But yeah, once I sort of got it working, it seemed silly not to, you know, get into the space. 'cause it was a lot of fun. I was really burnt out with the amount of time I was spent on the computer, which I think everyone is in our modern world. But, it was one of <span style="color:red" data-ts="692.915" data-end_ts="692.955" title="692.915" id=c_"692.915">__the__</span> other reasons I was getting into electronics again, was just to have something to do with my hands that was more outside of the computer. Which, you know, rack, that's one of the great, just the tactileness of it is still one of my favorite things about modular. Like, you really are touching and interacting with it, and it's such a more interesting connection than mouthing around. So after doing this as a hobby for a while and making some modules that, you know, were pretty popular last year, well both of us. But, I decided to re retire from the games industry and pursue this full time. And that's what we're doing now. So that's a, that's a quick summary. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>All right. Wow. That's a hell of a thing. Couple of quick questions before I I move over to Chris. First of all, where in Arkansas are you from? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Fayetteville is where I spent most of my youth, Northwest Arkansas. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>All right. I spent a year and a half out there. It was, it was a good place to pass through. Yeah. You pursued a <span style="color:red" data-ts="749.845" data-end_ts="750.045" title="749.845" id=c_"749.845">__math__</span> math degree. Did you actually, attain the degree? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Yep. It's tough to beat math as a degree for getting you prepared for anything. I mean, the main thing you get out of a math degree is the ability to think rationally and to build self-consistent arguments. And, you know, and like, that's really the main skill. And there's obviously a lot of like, specific math that's useful to a lot of specific engineering, for example. But like the, the main goal of like an undergraduate math degree is really just logical thinking. It's pretty good for everyone. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, not only logical thinking, but abstract thinking too, which is really, I think, is something that's really useful when you're doing something like trying to design, trying to design a module that doesn't necessarily have a specific end goal, you know, in terms of instead thinking in in more, abstract terms about what could be accomplished. Very interesting. <span style="color:red" data-ts="807.305" data-end_ts="807.525" title="807.305" id=c_"807.305">__All__</span> right. So Chris, how about you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kris: </b>My path was, substantially different than Stevens. I too was interested in music, from a pretty early age. I came from a musical family. My grandparents were, were professional piano and, and organ teachers actually. So everybody in my family was, I'll put in quotes, encouraged to play instruments. I was, what I discovered pretty quickly was I was really interested less in playing. <span style="color:red" data-ts="837.385" data-end_ts="837.605" title="837.385" id=c_"837.385">__And__</span> I, I was interested in that, but I was more interested in, in more engineering, live sound, that sort of thing. But I'm also not of the typical build that you find in a live sound sort of person, particularly in the nineties. I'm a little bit small for hefty a hundred pound gear, so I realized pretty quickly that was not going to be in my future. So I was doing some studio stuff even in high school. I, I got to engineer my first album when I was 16. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kris: </b>I think it was not a big album, mind you, in a small studio in northeastern Ohio, <laugh>. But I got to do one, and that was really fun. When it came time for college, I realized that most likely I was not going to have a career doing music. So I chose science, which was what my other main strength was. So I got a degree in biology and then went on to do a master's, then a PhD in biology. So I have many, many years of training. My focus was though, I, I still found a way to, to use my interest in music. I, my focus was acoustics, so I studied frogs and frog calling behavior. So I was still doing a lot with sound. If you ever need to know anything about recording frogs, I'm your girl. <laugh>. So that was what I spent many years doing all over, mostly the neotropics all over Latin America. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kris: </b>So I had a lot of, a lot of good times doing that. When it came time to go into a job though, I, I was training to go become a tenure track professor. I realized as I was getting job offers that it just wasn't what I wanted to do. Like, I'd spent all these years training for this job that wasn't where I wanted to be. And right around that time, noise engineering was really starting to take off and it became clear that it was not just a one <span style="color:red" data-ts="953.855" data-end_ts="954.075" title="953.855" id=c_"953.855">__man__</span> job anymore. So Steven took the company full-time. As he said he retired from video games. Shortly after that, we were able for me to leave behind academia, and I came on full-time as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What is it about, about the academic world that was uninteresting to you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kris: </b>I think, well there are many things. I think one of them is that funding for scientific research has been cut and cut and cut. And as a result, getting anything done in terms of research is becoming increasingly difficult. Unfortunately, that's one of the currencies in which you're measured as an academic. If you can't do research, if you don't do research and publish that research, then you are not valued as a scientist. But if there's no funding to do that research, it's very, very difficult to do the research to publish, to be valued as a scientist. And so it's kind of a never ending cycle of, of being devalued. At the same time, there's an increasing effort in to, I think there's, there's an increase in adjunct. So <span style="color:red" data-ts="1019.755" data-end_ts="1019.915" title="1019.755" id=c_"1019.755">__they__</span>, they've been calling it the adjunctification of higher education. So as facul faculty retire or leave, they aren't replacing tenure track lines. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kris: </b>And so they replace people with part-time faculty who typically are invariably are paid less and typically are treated not quite as well. That's not true everywhere, but typically that's true. No health insurance, no benefits of any kind, poor hours, various, various forms of poor treatment. And the students don't really understand the difference. So they have the same expectations of adjunct faculty as they do of tenure track faculty and don't understand why those faculty aren't as available. And when many times those faculty have to teach in five different places to pay their rent. Right. Like, I can't be here eight hours a day to have office hours for you because I have to be at five public jobs. Right. I was fortunately never in that position, but it's just watching the path that academia is taking it, it wasn't so much a world I was, I was as interested in being a part of. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So Steven started off noise engineering basically due to a gauntlet being thrown down, and so he glued together a module. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kris: </b>Yep. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>How did that set you in a position to say, I trust this, to leave enough to leave academia behind <laugh> and jump in? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kris: </b>Well, I think that part of it was that we looked at the numbers, and the sales were going. Okay. Part of it was that we made the calculated risk that if we could distribute the workload across two people, we could be more productive. And if it's two people that, you know, there's always the risk of hiring externally, right? Where if it's the two of us, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1134.825" data-end_ts="1135.045" title="1134.825" id=c_"1134.825">__if__</span>, if cuts need to be made, if a pay cut needs to happen, if, you know, whatever, we can shoulder risk a little bit better. If it's the two of us, we're also a little bit more invested than an external person might be. Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1147.205" data-end_ts="1147.525" title="1147.205" id=c_"1147.205">__Since__</span>, you know, the mortgage has to be paid <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. So how, how do you divide the work between the two of you? What is each of your specialty and what is the thing that you, I mean, if you were to shovel it off to somebody, what is the thing that you, neither, neither of you like doing 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>First? We, we do shovel a lot of stuff up. <laugh>. Yeah. <laugh> just put that out there, in front. We have the WMD, another URAC manufacturer actually does the majority of our, the physical aspects of our business. They do the manufacturer, they do the shipping, they're the people that are doing the boxing and stickering and all that. So, oh, okay. So we have, a great business partner in them because they do shoulder, a tremendous amount of just the logistical stuff so we can spend our time focusing on design new products and the promotion of the products and the brand. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1202.015" data-end_ts="1202.365" title="1202.015" id=c_"1202.015">__Those__</span>, that's primarily what we do. And so far as the split, it kind of splits pretty much that way. I, I do all, almost all technical, stuff. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1211.965" data-end_ts="1212.165" title="1211.965" id=c_"1211.965">__So__</span> Chris has actually started doing a lot of the CAD work, the PC board design, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kris: </b>I do anything administrative 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>And <span style="color:red" data-ts="1219.165" data-end_ts="1219.325" title="1219.165" id=c_"1219.165">__you__</span> Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kris: </b>Do, and I'm now doing, I've taken over a lot of the, oh, I do all the social media at this point, websites, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Yeah. Promotion videos. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kris: </b>But I'm, I'm not an engineer, so if it's hardware, software, that's gonna always be Steven, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>There still is this sense where you had a very fine tuned sense of audio and, and sonics and stuff. How do you, you get, how do you bring that into play? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kris: </b>Increasingly, I'm doing things like the test or, you know, we, we definitely, have quite a modular setup that I'm looking around the room here and there's quite a modular setup here. Yeah. We have trays and piles of modules, <laugh> prototypes, not prototypes, like which one is this? So I increasingly, I'm using my skills for that. The other sort of portion of, of things that we haven't talked about that I am hoping to really bring to the company, this is something that we're, we're starting to develop, but, is going to have to wait a little bit <span style="color:red" data-ts="1290.605" data-end_ts="1290.805" title="1290.605" id=c_"1290.605">__till__</span> we're a little bit more mature as a company. But, one of the things I'd like to do is develop low cost, scientific equipment, particularly for graduate students and, people in the developing world. I've seen how limited equipment can be and how limited students and, and particularly my colleagues in other countries have been in equipment that they can get. We're not gonna do a lot of equipment or anything like that, but maybe if we could do one, one item a year for reasonably low cost to better make better equipment than what's out there, then that would be a hugely gratifying thing to me. And that's something that I'll be heading up 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>If there's anything maybe I'm a little sick of right now, is the constant talk of disruption, right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1341.925" data-end_ts="1342.045" title="1341.925" id=c_"1341.925">__D__</span> disrupting industry. And, and it's always seems to be like, you know, we're gonna take something that works pretty well and we're gonna disrupt it because then, you know, we can tear it down and do something new. And there's economics in that. Right. It's actually interesting for me to, oh, and it all has to be done in software too. It's interesting to me that you're looking at being disruptive because you want more people to have access to stuff. It's an already kind of broken system, and it's one that's going to, that's gonna actually allow, I mean, in in what seems to be a world that is increasingly depressing interest in science, you're actually gonna do things that are gonna enhance the ability of people to do science. That's pretty interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kris: </b><laugh>. Well, I, I would've never called it disruptive to make some speakers for people to do playbacks, but <laugh>, I mean, the fact is, when I was doing the research that I was doing, like the, the best speakers that you could get, are PNO speakers, Uhhuh <affirmative>, the little guitar amps. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I know 'em. Yeah. And 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kris: </b>They're fine for what they are, but they're not, they're not flat at all. The frequency response is not flat at all. And so when you're trying to do a, any sort of playback experiment where you're playing a frog call back to another frog, right? And you expect it to sound like what it's actually supposed to sound like, but you're playing it through a speaker that doesn't have a flat response. Like, you know, but at the same time, you need a speaker that you can take out that's gonna be somewhat durable, that you can pull up either plug in or put on batteries. Like there aren't that many options out there. So, you know, making something like that, that people can use that isn't expensive. Like, that's not that hard. That's durable. Right. It's not hard. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>First of all, I have to tell you that, you know, I, I was a guitar player before, long before I was a synthesist. And so I've had my share of pig noses over the years. And so now the idea, the imagination in my head of what a frog going through a pig noses amp is, I have a very clear vision of exactly what that sounds like, <laugh>. And, it's probably something that another frog wouldn't even recognize. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kris: </b>It's, it's pretty amazing. 'cause I've seen people watch us, my students and me as we like, stand in the middle of a pond in the middle of like, somewhere in the Amazon playing frogs and, or sometimes traffic noise depending on the experiment. So I'm in the middle of a pond in the middle of nowhere and people are walking by looking at me like I am completely nuts. <laugh>. But you know, <laugh> science. <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Science. So, let me ask a, a few details. First of all, it's interesting, I, interviewed William at WMDA while ago. I need to touch base with him again. I actually went to his plant and I, I got to see his operation. It's really quite an amazing thing. And he actually, he does manufacturing for an awful lot of people. To what extent is, was him doing that something that really allowed you to do this? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Oh 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Would you have been able to do it if, if he hadn't been a manufacturing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>It's really absolutely not. Yeah. Particularly when I was still, and it was when it was still a hobby that was kind of growing like mad and I was still working full-time at a job that made ridiculous demands on my time. Like there was no way I could have possibly ever manufactured modules, you know, with, with that, with, with the life I had. So, like, and they actually do, I mean, he builds prototypes. They do a lot of like little things for us that some of those are, just history for when I was so time constrained <span style="color:red" data-ts="1567.445" data-end_ts="1567.645" title="1567.445" id=c_"1567.445">__that__</span> anything that they could do, I would have them do. But a lot of 'em, it works out well. Just 'cause we can focus entirely on product development now. Sort of started for a different reason than it continues to go on for now. But Yeah. Yeah. He's essential, he's been essential to our success. Absolutely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kris: </b>He, him and his entire team. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Yeah. All, all of the guys there. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So I'm looking at your website. It looks like you have on the front page, you have 19 different modules, which is, I didn't even know that was true, until I looked here. 'cause I remember when the, again, I'm gonna just start like making up pronunciations for this stuff. Mm-Hmm. And then you can tell me what it actually is, right? I remember when the, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1613.255" data-end_ts="1613.605" title="1613.255" id=c_"1613.255">__Taric__</span> Trans Electron was out and I was like, oh, that seems pretty interesting. And then I was like, and then the ADI metric, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1624.445" data-end_ts="1624.525" title="1624.445" id=c_"1624.445">__whatever__</span>. Yeah. When that, when that came up, I was like, well that looks really smart. I the number of times that would've saved my ass, you know? And then the Basim <span style="color:red" data-ts="1635.045" data-end_ts="1635.205" title="1635.045" id=c_"1635.045">__interest__</span>, you've already said it twice and I've already don't remember 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b><laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But that came out and that was the one that like everybody started getting into, that was the one where all of a sudden on Muff Wiggler, like every third ad would be like, I'll trade. You know, it's like four trade, my small child for your bassist <span style="color:red" data-ts="1655.725" data-end_ts="1655.965" title="1655.725" id=c_"1655.725">__center__</span>

<b>Stephen: </b><laugh>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1658.155" data-end_ts="1658.445" title="1658.155" id=c_"1658.155">__Yeah__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It, it got to be a, a real thing for you. What was, what was like the curve? I mean, the Atari thing? Was that, was that pretty popular out of the gate or was that, or was the whole thing kind of a slow rise for you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>I mean a bit of both. The, the anorexic transiton actually did really well, particularly, you know, it <span style="color:red" data-ts="1683.165" data-end_ts="1683.205" title="1683.165" id=c_"1683.165">__was__</span> the first module we did like the, the pricing with the retailers was not great. Like I think it actually could have develop better if the retailer's cheaper. But there's, you know, nobody, when you do your first module's, you have to develop trust with all of the retailers and the customers. But yeah, we sold through, I mean, 150 units in six months on the at which for our first module for brand is not, is pretty good. And we still actually sell those, we still sell through <span style="color:red" data-ts="1709.845" data-end_ts="1709.965" title="1709.845" id=c_"1709.845">__a__</span> fair number of those. I mean, not big numbers, but consistently small numbers. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1714.145" data-end_ts="1714.365" title="1714.145" id=c_"1714.145">__The__</span> bilis is definitely when it put us on the map, it put us in the map. It also put us in the black, <laugh> <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>So, yeah, you have to put up, it takes a lot of money to, to get a module made and to develop it to, you know, just the basics of the advertising you need to put out to release a module. You know, there's a fair amount of cost there. Yeah. The, the BI was when we finally weren't just spending money <span style="color:red" data-ts="1740.825" data-end_ts="1741.045" title="1740.825" id=c_"1740.825">__on__</span> our own right. To try to get these out. But yeah, the BI I a, which is the second version of the bi, you know, continues to sell well as well. It's definitely been, a module that has kept our company going and, you know, a lot of the smaller modules don't sell as well. But this, you know, not surprising. We're definitely, we're trying to get our, particularly this year, we're gonna put out a lot of smaller modules that are sort of utility and useful, but to try to just flush out our module selection to really get, you know, a really broad selection of modules. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1772.215" data-end_ts="1772.295" title="1772.215" id=c_"1772.215">__I__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1772.295" data-end_ts="1772.415" title="1772.295" id=c_"1772.295">__guess__</span> there's still a lot of niches and things. If you wanna build an all noise engineering case, there's still some things that we need to get out before that's really possible. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Is that, is that a goal for you though, to be able to make sort of like a standalone Absolutely. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1784.065" data-end_ts="1784.285" title="1784.065" id=c_"1784.065">__Any__</span> system? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Yep. That's, yeah, very much is. We're pretty close by the end of the year. We should, ideally yeah, we should have that and we, we can do it, now, but we have to use some of the prototypes <span style="color:red" data-ts="1797.405" data-end_ts="1797.605" title="1797.405" id=c_"1797.405">__for__</span> this stuff that's coming out later this year. So. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see. So now what is the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1802.045" data-end_ts="1802.245" title="1802.045" id=c_"1802.045">__di__</span> the B, okay, I'm gonna use your plan of action here, which is to use initials so I don't have to stumble over my front teeth <span style="color:red" data-ts="1810.205" data-end_ts="1810.445" title="1810.205" id=c_"1810.205">__here__</span> for the rest of the, the chat. Right. I'm always curious when people make, do like a major version Rev, right. So what is, what was the impetus goal from the BI to the bi I a, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1822.115" data-end_ts="1822.405" title="1822.115" id=c_"1822.115">__Bamo__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Malter? <span style="color:red" data-ts="1823.765" data-end_ts="1823.965" title="1823.765" id=c_"1823.765">__Yep__</span>. I mean, a lot of it was just the BI was really the first major module that I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1829.885" data-end_ts="1829.965" title="1829.885" id=c_"1829.885">__had__</span> designed, and I honestly just made a lot of mistakes in the design and it was cool. Like the core of it was awesome, and people, that's what people were obviously responding to. But there are just a lot of details that could have been a lot better about it, largely mechanical. Like <span style="color:red" data-ts="1843.345" data-end_ts="1843.565" title="1843.345" id=c_"1843.345">__if__</span> the BIA is two HP smaller, I think the knob arrangement is actually far superior. It's better for cable management. A lot of the other features were really driven by user feedback. Nobody liked having the knobs scale inputs rather than offset. So I, the knobs on the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1859.205" data-end_ts="1859.605" title="1859.205" id=c_"1859.205">__BIA__</span> now offset the voltage input, which also allows 'em to be used bipolar just implicitly. And everyone wanted to see, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1866.605" data-end_ts="1866.725" title="1866.605" id=c_"1866.605">__we__</span> controlled the switches, which I had, you know, never even really considered, but we added that feature as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>And then one of the, like, it's almost a hilarious oversight with the original BIS that it didn't, didn't really make a really ballsy kick. Like it just didn't make that sound. And so that was the other thing we added, was a, the liquid mode, which adds a pitch envelope. It's just a pitch envelope to the other mode. It's not a large change, software-wise, but it was a huge change sonically. So the BIA can finally really punch in the face. So that was <span style="color:red" data-ts="1897.965" data-end_ts="1898.125" title="1897.965" id=c_"1897.965">__pr__</span> pretty much it, like the core synthesis other than adding that third mode, like there were just a couple minor polishes, but nothing, nothing significant. And then the mechanical stuff and just the user interface stuff. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>From there, the next one that I caught really coming out was the l I'll let you pronounce it, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1918.285" data-end_ts="1918.605" title="1918.285" id=c_"1918.285">__Quali__</span>, aita 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Terra toss. All right. Oh, okay. So here we're seeing the ITER toss being the, Latin for oscillator, you idiot kind of <laugh>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1929.885" data-end_ts="1930.085" title="1929.885" id=c_"1929.885">__Oh__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Yeah. It means repetitiousness, which is 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Like iterative. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Iterative. Oh yeah, iterative. Okay. Of course, sure. That is more of a, what people would normally think of as an oscillator rather than something that kind of had this percussion orientation. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Yeah. It is a free running oscillator that's just made to give you the biggest, most gnarliest sounds you can get. <laugh>, it's just a big noise beast. It has three modes and they're all, they're all modes based off dual pitches. So it goes, it's in the complex oscillator sort of family where, you know, the interaction between multiple elements generates some really extreme complexity, of sound. So it 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kris: </b>Sounds really raunchy in a lot of places 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>In a good way. <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You've kind of, you know, put your stake in the ground as, as kind of doing stuff that's aggressive, edgy, noisy in your face, which is, you know, certainly in the, in the case of, of current Euro world, that's, that's kind of a good spot to be. That's where a lot of people come into. Your <span style="color:red" data-ts="1993.465" data-end_ts="1993.685" title="1993.465" id=c_"1993.465">__rec__</span> systems are kind of, that's where they want to be sonically anyway. Right. But you also found ways to do it in a way that wasn't necessarily a complete, I'll be kind and say a complete homage to Don <span style="color:red" data-ts="2006.705" data-end_ts="2007.125" title="2006.705" id=c_"2006.705">__Buchla__</span> designs or someone, someone else's previous designs. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>I mean, there's still, I mean, like with the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2012.815" data-end_ts="2013.165" title="2012.815" id=c_"2012.815">__laqua__</span>, like all three modes are old thoughts. I mean, they're not seventies style. There's a lot of Yeah, there's a lot of original sheen on them that I put, but the algorithms were all published in the seventies. Sure, okay. There, two of them, like are not well known outside of the sort of people who just like to read audio synthesis papers from the seventies. But they're really cool, they're really, really interesting algorithms just from a technical standpoint. And they sound cool 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Well, but now see that's what's interesting to me though, is, I mean, I actually like reading old papers from the seventies, but there's an awful lot of old papers from the seventies, quite frankly. And so what were the things that influenced you to come up with, where were you that you ran across these? Was this something that you ran across in your research, in the game audio development? Or is it something that you just got a burr under your saddle and decided to do some research? What, what caught what kind those in your attention? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Right. I'm a pretty voracious reader as part of it. These are not really related to anything, I was doing in games. I th like all of the algorithms in the li well, one of them is this phase modulation that that's very common. So I'm not, the other two are both actually referenced in one of the Curtis Rhodes books, probably Micro Sounds. And that's where I actually found those two papers. The original aquatic was just this algorithm called VE <span style="color:red" data-ts="2098.505" data-end_ts="2098.725" title="2098.505" id=c_"2098.505">__Sim__</span>, which I pretty sure it was just, it was like a four page section of micro sounds talking about vocal synthesis algorithms, particularly the older ones. The like true synthesis that I found really fascinating. And the papers were really interesting and I mocked one up and I was like, this thing sounds amazing. Like at some point I needed three algorithms for the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2119.385" data-end_ts="2119.605" title="2119.385" id=c_"2119.385">__li__</span> and I had like a table of like five possibilities that I had read about. And just trying to figure out the ones that all fit with the same sort of control, control structure the best. And that's kind of how it ended up being, those specific threes. 'cause they all kind of, I could fit them into the same knobs and have it, have the controls not be completely different, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Have it still <span style="color:red" data-ts="2140.165" data-end_ts="2140.365" title="2140.165" id=c_"2140.165">__make__</span> sense. Right, exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>So yeah, I don't, I I'm not sure I've answered your question. It's really, I just read a lot <laugh> pretty much the, the summary. 'cause there's a ton of great ideas that people seem to have forgotten, buried in, in some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data">PD</a>F somewhere on the internet. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>As I mentioned at the beginning of our talk. One, one of the things that I've noticed is that you are one of the companies that's like kind of loved, right? There are some companies that people say like, yep, I'll buy it 'cause it works. You know, and there are other people that, there are other companies that people get passionate about. You're one of those. Why do you think that is? And what do you, do you ever like say, we have these passionate people, so we need to go out <span style="color:red" data-ts="2184.605" data-end_ts="2184.765" title="2184.605" id=c_"2184.605">__off__</span> our way to do X Or conversely, we want more passionate people, so we're gonna do x to try and make that happen. How do you, how do you interact when something commercial also turns passionate for people? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kris: </b>That's a tough 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Question. Yeah. I don't know. Yeah. I don't think we ever intend, you know, this was never a intention to develop a passionate following <laugh>. I mean, it's great, great. Yeah. But I can complain <span style="color:red" data-ts="2208.305" data-end_ts="2208.525" title="2208.305" id=c_"2208.305">__and__</span>, you know, absolutely. Our, our users are awesome. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kris: </b>We get great questions, but we also get great feedback. And I think maybe that's part of, part of it is that we really seek out and, and listen to feedback from our users. We have a network of local friends. We're fortunate to be in LA where there is a pretty substantial modular scene, I guess. So we have a lot of people that we can hand a module to and say, give us feedback <span style="color:red" data-ts="2238.865" data-end_ts="2239.085" title="2238.865" id=c_"2238.865">__and__</span> hand hand 'em a prototype and say, what would you change? What do you like, whatever. And, and we can go outside of just the two of us and say what needs to be fixed? And we get a lot of really good feedback from those people. But even after something's in the wild, we get a lot of feedback and module ideas. People email us pretty regularly with ideas, questions, and whatever. That's part of what's spawned the, if you're looking at the website, there's now a blog that we just launched and we're focusing on questions that we get at trade shows all the time. I, you know, we get the same questions over and over again. So, trying to just answer those questions in a sort of informational way. So maybe that's, that's a start. What else can you add? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>I don't know. I mean, if people got really excited about the bi, that's like, when that happened, that was because of the baus like that, that's when people started <span style="color:red" data-ts="2293.285" data-end_ts="2293.445" title="2293.285" id=c_"2293.285">__to__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2293.445" data-end_ts="2293.645" title="2293.445" id=c_"2293.445">__become__</span> very excited about the brand. And I think, I mean, it has a very unique character for a variety of technical reasons. Like, I don't think there's, I don't think even still there's a mod out there that can quite give you as many different tams and how big of a space it is, you know? And so people became very excited by just sort of like how much power it has. I don't know. And then it just sounds clunky as hell. We've also like, I dunno, somehow we, like with that module and with the li we hit, we just hit some nerves that people really responded to. And like, it wasn't, it wasn't intentional. Both of those modules were just me trying to make something that made me happy, that made all of the sounds I wanted to, and then as as many more possible combinations, back to the abstraction. We were talking about that earlier actually. So yeah, I'm, I'm very glad that we have passionate users though. Yes. <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I certainly have talked to a lot of people in the LA area. I kind of have this run here where I've, I've interviewed a lot of the LA Modular Mafia that all knows each other and interacts with each other. And they all talked a lot about you. You mentioned that you, you have them available sort of as testers. Do you, do you guys ever play out? Yep. Are you, so your players as well as, as just builders? That's, that's cool. Do you ever do the modular on the spot stuff? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Yep, yep. I've done it twice. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2377.775" data-end_ts="2378.125" title="2377.775" id=c_"2377.775">__Right__</span>. Three times though. Just twice. And Chris has done it once. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kris: </b>I was hoping I'm, I think I might be doing it again in May. I didn't have to talk to Bonna again. She'd asked me to do it in April for the ladies take Uber. But we had just come back from Super Booth and I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2392.145" data-end_ts="2392.365" title="2392.145" id=c_"2392.145">__do__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2392.365" data-end_ts="2392.445" title="2392.365" id=c_"2392.365">__my__</span> case together, so I had <span style="color:red" data-ts="2394.785" data-end_ts="2395.005" title="2394.785" id=c_"2394.785">__opt__</span> outta that one. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So you say you just got back from the, from the Super booth. You, you guys were at NAMM too, right? At that like crazy booth? Yeah. Which unfortunately I didn't get a chance to spend as much time at this year as I I have in the past. What is that like for you? I mean, talk about different than either your backgrounds <laugh>, you know, right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Don't set you up for like dropping the middle of music instrument Loony <span style="color:red" data-ts="2421.205" data-end_ts="2421.445" title="2421.205" id=c_"2421.205">__Land__</span>. Right. And NAMM is just a different version of what you would've experienced at Super Booth. Do you do any other shows? Do you do like Knob <span style="color:red" data-ts="2430.245" data-end_ts="2430.445" title="2430.245" id=c_"2430.245">__Con__</span> or any of these others? Yeah, we're 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kris: </b>Talking about doing Knob <span style="color:red" data-ts="2432.725" data-end_ts="2432.885" title="2432.725" id=c_"2432.725">__Con__</span> this year. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>We've done, we've done a variety of them. It's always you. We don't have the time or the resources to hit all of 'em, so it's always, you know, we just have to make a judgment call about whether we think it's the right show to go to this year. You know, it changes every year, which one we go to too. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Yeah. What is that like for you? What to, I mean, first of all, you're gonna interact with a lot of people you never saw before and probably never gonna see again or maybe only have ever interacted with via email. What's, what's it like to get out on the road with that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Yeah, it's, it definitely, so I'm of the introverted persuasion pretty extremely, I guess <laugh>, so like, one of the things I actually really enjoyed, but it was very difficult for me when I first really go, started going to NAMM Nam was the only show we did for on NAMM and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2482.565" data-end_ts="2482.765" title="2482.565" id=c_"2482.565">__alligator__</span> events, but they weren't. But like, did <span style="color:red" data-ts="2485.005" data-end_ts="2485.125" title="2485.005" id=c_"2485.005">__they__</span> talk about getting me like, out of my comfort zone? Like it was, just hugely, I guess uncomfortable, but good because like, you know, it's one of those things that I'm like, this is going to make me better talking to people. This is gonna make me just, you know, in general a better person. And so it was, you know, the first couple years of it were pretty intense. Nowadays it's old hat and it's just kind of like, yes, I'm gonna talk to 45 people today and tell 'em all the same thing and it's great. And I, you know, and I love, I, I'm at the point where I'm, I'm starting to guess I get cynical about getting demos, but I really love talking to the customers. One-on-one, like, it's, it's fantastic. Like that experience is pretty much always great. And there, there are a few assholes out there, I guess, but not, not very many in the world. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kris: </b>There're much more, many more assholes at mam than there are someplace like Super <span style="color:red" data-ts="2532.645" data-end_ts="2532.925" title="2532.645" id=c_"2532.645">__Booth__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b><laugh>. Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2533.915" data-end_ts="2534.205" title="2533.915" id=c_"2533.915">__Well__</span> Mam is so crazy. There's so many randos that walk in. They're like, where's the keyboard? It's like, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kris: </b>Or the guy that said, I don't believe in this. Convince me. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. There is a lot of strange activity. A lot of times at trade shows like that, you don't even know what people's a, you have no idea why they're there in the first place, but secondly, you also don't know what their angle is. You know, half the time you're like, okay, you get this sense that, okay, maybe they're from some, you know, big electronics firm who's just sweeping through to see if there's any, if there's any industry they can obliterate on their way to their next, you know, major oil spill or something. <laugh>. Right. <laugh>, you know, and it's, it's kind weird. It's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2584.685" data-end_ts="2584.885" title="2584.685" id=c_"2584.685">__kind__</span> of weird to see sort of like very industrialist people interact with the music world, which are largely, I mean, it's funny because there are some identifiers I see at, music industry, trade shows that are different from almost the rest of the entire population. One of 'em is that you go outside the building, there are like 40 times more smokers in the MI world than there is anywhere else. Just I think because, you know, they just walked out of playing at the local Holiday Inn and now they're, all of a sudden hired by PV or something. Right. So it's kind of like a, a very different entree path into, into the industry than, than most industries. I think it's pretty interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kris: </b>It's definitely interesting to be, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2629.765" data-end_ts="2629.885" title="2629.765" id=c_"2629.765">__I__</span>, I mean, just sort of adding on something Steven said a minute ago, like talking to the customers though at these trade shows, you're right. There are some, some of these people that you're not quite sure what their angle is, but talking to the customers is definitely the highlight. At these, at these shows. And anybody that sees us at one of these, I encourage you to come talk to us 'cause and ask us any questions that you have. Is it will, I promise you it will not be the dumbest question we get. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's, that's hilarious. That's excellent. Again, it's a little different selling modules than it would be like if you're selling ukuleles or you know, Eddie Vanil and Guitar Stacks or something. I guess you, you, it's a kind of an interesting customer base you're working with. So for those of us who are a little obsessive about our <span style="color:red" data-ts="2679.285" data-end_ts="2679.485" title="2679.285" id=c_"2679.285">__sense__</span> stuff though, what is, what are the areas of your business that we're gonna see changing? What is your product lineup gonna change in ways that are <span style="color:red" data-ts="2689.405" data-end_ts="2689.645" title="2689.405" id=c_"2689.405">__going__</span> to be interesting to us? Eurorack fanatics? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kris: </b>The big thing I think is just, we'll be <span style="color:red" data-ts="2698.175" data-end_ts="2698.415" title="2698.175" id=c_"2698.175">__full__</span>, we'll be expanding a bit to have products in pretty much every, every form that you might need. So if you need utilities, if you know whatever you need, we're, we expect to be slotting into each of those different domains. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Just to reinforce that, like we have a lot of utility stuff coming <span style="color:red" data-ts="2718.255" data-end_ts="2718.375" title="2718.255" id=c_"2718.255">__up__</span> this year. Next year should be the year of audio processing for us. We have a whole bunch of stuff stacked up for that. We have a couple really exciting things we're not gonna talk about today, unfortunately, that we'll be talking about next year at namm, outside of the URAC space. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2735.885" data-end_ts="2736.175" title="2735.885" id=c_"2735.885">__Well__</span>, two of them, one of 'em we'll be talking about in a couple months. But we're not quite ready to go public <span style="color:red" data-ts="2740.975" data-end_ts="2741.175" title="2740.975" id=c_"2740.975">__with__</span> some of those. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2741.575" data-end_ts="2741.775" title="2741.575" id=c_"2741.575">__You__</span> have, we have a lot to come, I guess <span style="color:red" data-ts="2744.115" data-end_ts="2744.335" title="2744.115" id=c_"2744.115">__is__</span> a quick summary, across the board. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kris: </b>Some awesome new modules that we've been showing at shows. So those, you <span style="color:red" data-ts="2750.215" data-end_ts="2750.335" title="2750.215" id=c_"2750.215">__know__</span>, people are starting to see those. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2752.875" data-end_ts="2753.095" title="2752.875" id=c_"2752.875">__Yep__</span>. And we have even a couple more surprises in your <span style="color:red" data-ts="2755.555" data-end_ts="2755.775" title="2755.555" id=c_"2755.555">__act__</span> for this year as well. That once again, like we talk about in two months, <laugh>. Alright. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Well, we'll touch base in two months then. It sounds very exciting. I wanna thank you guys for spending the time, for taking the time out of your schedule and for, for chatting. It was really great to, to get caught up. Next time I'm out in la I'll, we will go out for a coffee or something and, I really, enjoy hanging out with you today. Thanks so much. Thank 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kris: </b>You. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright. And with that I'll say goodbye. Bye 
</p>

<p>
<b>Kris: </b>Bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2784.995" data-end_ts="2785.215" title="2784.995" id=c_"2784.995">__Bye__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, many thanks to Steven and Chris for spending the time. That was really interesting. I'm really anxious to see the new stuff they come out with and hopefully by the time it comes out, I'll know how to say the names of their modules. Your <span style="color:red" data-ts="2804.815" data-end_ts="2805.135" title="2804.815" id=c_"2804.815">__<inaudible>__</span>. Indeed. So anyway, thank you, very much for listening again this week. Thanks a lot for continuing to tune in and telling your friends. We're giving you really nice growth still in the podcast. So that's a good sign, right? But keep on keeping on with that. I want just a few shoutouts again to, my employer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_%2774">Cycling '74</a> They're always very supportive of this. Thanks to the people over at opia. Hope you all get well and, everyone else that's helping out. I really appreciate all of your work. Thanks much and we'll catch you next week. Bye.
