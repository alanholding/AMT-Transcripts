<b>Darwin: </b>Alright, today I have the great opportunity to chat, chat to a guy I've gotten to know, well, I got to know him probably a decade ago, and we've always stayed in touch. We always have a great time, ribbing each other, just talking to each other every time we meet. I caught up with him just before namm, to get scheduled for a podcast interview. Talked to him, verified at namm, and now here he is. So I'm really excited to introduce you to Houston Secretary. Hey man. How's it going? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston Singletary: </b>It's going good. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright. Hey, thanks for taking time outta your schedule to, to have a chat. I really appreciate it. Sure. Why don't we kick this off by having you describe what you're doing right now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>Okay. So basically, you know, 24 hours a day, five days a week, really seven days a week. I'm, I'm working for a company by the name of Ableton, and most folks probably listening to this podcast are familiar with Ableton and the products live and push. And, you know, I've been with this company full-time for just over 10 years. So I think we're on 11th year now. And my role has changed over the years. When you and I met, I was sort of in the position of clinician, presenter, demo guy, and that would be both on the retail front, you know, at the, at the educational level, store level, and of course trade shows. And that's, that's kind of where we met along with the cycling crew back in the day. And since then, over that 10 year span, obviously the company's grown and the products have evolved, but my role has changed many times from, you know, a clinician to the demo guide, to a brand manager working in retail, working in education, even marketing to a certain extent. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>And over the past year, my new role, if you will, is working primarily and exclusively with the Sound team from the Berlin office, which is located in Berlin, Germany. So, and that's our headquarters. And, although I live stateside and I'm based stateside, I work full-time alongside the sound team, crew, which is technically called the PAX team. So, and that umbrella basically includes quite a, an arsenal of folks, some really talented folks across the team from development all the way to the folks that work specifically with our live packs and with our sound. And that's where I come in. And so my primary role is basically handling all our preset creation and content creation and the sound design for live. Yeah. And so it's, it's, it's great. I love it. It's a lot of fun and keeps me very busy. I, I I'm afforded the opportunity to work with a great group of folks on the outside as well in regards to freelance contributors. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>Mm-Hmm. <span style="color:red" data-ts="179.045" data-end_ts="179.085" title="179.045" id=c_"179.045">__<affirmative>__</span> from Sound Design. So some really quality talented people out there that I've, that I've brought into the fold working as freelancers as well. Just, you know, just creating content that we're working with, with Live nine and working with PACS and things like that and overseeing that and, you know, daily work, you know, communicating and working alongside my peers, right. Who are based on the Berlin team. So it's in conclusion on that, as far as what I'm doing right now, it's, it's, it's interesting because it, it, it might be confusing to some folks and some of my peers and friends that are like, wait, you still work for Ableton, but not in the us. And it's like, I, I'm literally removed from all duties in the US if you will. So, I'm very close to this team that we have stateside, right? Ableton Inc. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>Which is based in Pasadena. I'm incredibly close to that team. And, and, but I work, like I said, for the sound team, and it's great and it's kind of full circle, you know, it's where I started and working with sound and, and creating and working with synthesizers and production and all in that, on that studio recording sense, you know, and it, and it's, it's a, you know, a testament to the, to the Ableton team that I sort of moved into this role and I've embraced it and, and I really enjoy it. So that's what I'm doing now. It's keeping me really busy. I'm still, you know, I'm obviously composing and doing things on the outside and, and, musically, multimedia and scoring and things like that, working, you know, a couple of sound library companies doing pieces for them and, and keeping myself busy there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>But primarily it's, it's all Ableton every day, like I said, 24 7. And a lot of that is just because I love it so much. It's just, if I can make sound all day and, and work with sampling and work with technology, you know, it's, you're living life, right? Well, I, yeah, I got living a life, but it's gonna take, it's gonna, it, it takes me into areas that just keep me completely ensconced in what I do. So it's, you know, whether it's, you know, after hours or whatever, it's like, Hey, wait, maybe if I, maybe if I, we, I did a quick sampling session with this and brought this into here, <span style="color:red" data-ts="306.285" data-end_ts="306.505" title="306.285" id=c_"306.285">__or__</span> created this sort of rack device this way. And, you know, it's interesting. I'm sure we'll get into that, but that's, that's primarily what I'm doing now. So, <span style="color:red" data-ts="314.225" data-end_ts="314.425" title="314.225" id=c_"314.225">__and__</span> you know, there's aspects of my, my previous role, which was a lot of presentations, a lot of interaction on the university and K through 12 and educational level in regards to evangelizing, Ableton live, you know, live and push, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>And I, and I miss that aspect a lot. But, you know, over time working in this new role, I, you know, I can see where it's just, <span style="color:red" data-ts="336.805" data-end_ts="337.025" title="336.805" id=c_"336.805">__it__</span>, it's just there aren't enough hours in the day. I still try to connect that way through, somewhat through my Instagram page and, and that tutorial sort of aspect on the social channels where I can, you know, those events, those types of things where I'm presenting or doing a panel, they're, they're a little bit more spaced out. <span style="color:red" data-ts="354.505" data-end_ts="354.625" title="354.505" id=c_"354.505">__I__</span> actually, we, I think I'll see you at one at, at Berkeley next month. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yes, indeed. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>Right? So those kinds of things, those kinds of events, I really cherish those. 'cause that's where I, I get to interact and, and, and hang out with my peers and people I respect and get up there and just talk about the gear, and talk about the technology and hopefully, you know, kick off a light bulb, turn on a, you know, something with these students and with these individuals that, you know, are trying to get into this crazy world of technology and sequencing and modular and synthesizers. And so, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, one of the things I want to do is I wanna dive into a little bit of your, work as a presenter slash cl clinician, because mm-Hmm, <affirmative>, when I used to watch you wa work, like at the NAMM Show as an example, first of all, you seem to be tireless, but secondly, you also, unlike a lot of people, you brought a lot of aspects of performance to it. You were engaging with the crowd. You would, you kind of had like an arc to the way that you presented things. You were always really prepared, but at the same time, it always looked like you put yourself in a, you had a little bit of risk so that there was that kind of real world performance aspect to what you were doing. Was that just making that up or is that really how you approached it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>No, I think, you know, making it up is always an interesting aspect. 'cause I think sometimes folks look at that like, Hey, hey bro, kind of winging it there, but it worked out <laugh>. It's like, yeah, lemme turn my mic off now. Let's talk about it. But Right. It's, yeah, those were, those were good times. And I kind of look at it 'cause it was kind of back then in the day, you know, a decade or so ago and through 2012, I think. Right. And I, yeah, I think you kind of nailed it on the head. I think there's a couple aspects that, that I bring sort of to my presentation stage, whether it was with product or, or presenting something more in a formal sense, you know, like a product debut or something like that. But, Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, when you're showing gear, first of all, I think a number one is you gotta really, <span style="color:red" data-ts="485.965" data-end_ts="486.255" title="485.965" id=c_"485.965">__well__</span>, first you not only do you need to have an understanding of how it works under the hood, but you gotta, you've gotta really dig the product. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>Yeah. You, I mean, you gotta, it's, <span style="color:red" data-ts="495.215" data-end_ts="495.415" title="495.215" id=c_"495.215">__and__</span>, you know, with Ableton, like literally, whether it's connected to an APC 40 making its debut or, or push or showing it with Max for live, I mean, that's fun for me. That's just fun stuff. The performance aspect or the way you sort of frame that, that comes into play, I think from just being a producer for so many years in the studio and a session player and being on call for a couple of decades, you know, I started my session playing synth programming gig as an occupation as early as, I wanna say 92, maybe 1991 <span style="color:red" data-ts="532.555" data-end_ts="532.775" title="532.555" id=c_"532.555">__and__</span> West Coast, east Coast, you know, LA to Atlanta, New York, working for producers and record labels. And quite a variety of situations where I would be in studios on call with some formidable folks from, you know, Babyface to Brennan O'Brien, to all kinds of different artists. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>And, you know, my job was to create on the fly, play on the fly, figure things out, you know, on the fly. And, and I really enjoy that aspect. I enjoy sitting sort of in the, the bevy of individuals sort of looking at me saying, what, what are we gonna do next? Oh, blew me away now, man. A bridge works there. Right? Well, I don't know, blowing them away, but it's sort of like the, the part may be complete, you know, crap. But it's like, guys, we, we gotta put a bridge here, but we'll just, we'll cut it on on the up of four and then come back into the, into the chorus and it's like, yeah, let's do that. And it's like, so playing these different ideas in different parts and always recording or having one hand on the record button as they say, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>Was sort of the story of my life for a couple of decades leading up to my Ableton, you know, entry into the Ableton presenting world. And I think there's, it's an interesting thing. 'cause you know, as you walk around the Nasho floor and you're seeing it's, it's changed, I think in the last 3, 4, 5 years. It's a little less of dog and pony and a little bit more of upfront, personal, smaller booze, more kind of like confined product presentations and things like that. You're always gonna see the bigger sort of demos that UA and Digi or, or Avid, things like that. But I think from the performance kind of, all encompassing aspect that I would present it, it was a combination of being able to multitask, keep the individuals that are, that are watching engaged, but also pull individuals in. I used to enjoy doing that too. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>It's like, I could sort of make some eye contact with somebody <laugh>, and not really the pouty muffins guy that's in the back with his arms folded that wants nothing to do with this software or this product, but more of the person that's kind of down front. It's like really sort of like they're, they're interested, but they're also a little confused, right? 'cause it's, it's, it's information overload. So it's like, Hey man, what, what's your name? Okay, cool. So where do you find yourself when, when you're trying to work on some drum parts? What, what point of that process do you feel you need something like this? And then that question or question that's sort of framed, like, that opens up a direction that sort of engages other folks. And then you can sort of take that and, and, you know, the whole time that you, that I'm doing that I'm also recording or playing, like you said, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>And I think that's the part that sort of freaks people out a little bit. They're like, what? Geez, man, <laugh>, what is going, what is he? Did he just create that little part? And <span style="color:red" data-ts="705.495" data-end_ts="705.655" title="705.495" id=c_"705.495">__it__</span>, and again, not to, it's not like, to me it's, it's not really rocket science, it's just, it's just loving what you do, understanding the technology, understanding the scope of what needs to be presented from a, in this case, a company standpoint. Right. You know, keeping those boundaries. But at the end of the day, it's a trade show, man. And it's like, it's, it's not a Ted Talk <laugh> that's different <laugh>, you know, it's not, it's not up in front of Sweetwater, right. Crew at seven in the morning doing a, an important presentation that's, that's a little different. You know, you've got PowerPoints and you've got your iPad with your cue sheets on the floor, and you're doing, you know, everything's all sort of framed out. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>And the trade shows were, were awesome. And I'm one of those rare birds that actually really enjoys those, the trade shows. They're like, oh, NAMS coming man, right? I guess I'll see you guys in January, man, right? And I'm like, Hey man, who's, who's gonna be at namm? You know? <span style="color:red" data-ts="758.165" data-end_ts="758.325" title="758.165" id=c_"758.165">__Yeah__</span>. It's kind of like, it's different now. I mean, different capacity for me, and I'm not really presenting as much, but it's, I I have to say there was a turning point from, for doing those types of shows, and that was back with a really good group of folks that worked with M Audio back when m Audio was in his heyday. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And if, the funny thing about M Audio was there was a time when m Audio distributed Isotope, Ableton and Propeller Heads. That's right, that's right. All under one umbrella. And the crew was great. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>Like they had this whole team of folks, it was so much fun. And we would, and it wasn't just Nam, it was Remix Hotel and a <span style="color:red" data-ts="792.405" data-end_ts="792.685" title="792.405" id=c_"792.405">__ES__</span> and all these different CES and, and we would roll out to these shows and just present all these awesome products. And, and that's where I actually kind of got my start doing public presentations per se. And this, this, individual named <span style="color:red" data-ts="806.405" data-end_ts="807.045" title="806.405" id=c_"806.405">__Adam Castillo__</span> and Mike Heckler and, and some of these guys, they, they kind of brought me into that fold. And I was the new guy. It was a producer in a studio that was suddenly brought up on stage to show these products. And to be quite honest, there were times when I was sort of flying by the seat of my pants, like, you know, look guys, I don't really know how this works, <laugh>, but they really want me to show it to you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>So we're gonna break it down in a studio sense. Like Right, right. We're, let's make a hypothetical situation. That was, that's another thing that I, that I would do in these presentations. I would create scenarios, whether it's a bedroom producer or more in a studio situation type thing. A large format kind of studio or tracking, <span style="color:red" data-ts="842.545" data-end_ts="842.765" title="842.545" id=c_"842.545">__or__</span> you recording yourself as a singer songwriter. And those are the sort of aspects that I would bring to that game. I mean, I was working with vendors way back in the day. My first one was a Kai, and I worked with a Kai from 92 to the mid nineties, but never, never trade shows per se. And it was when the trade show thing started, I used to go to namm, but just as a guest, right. And I would see these guys like Phil Jackson, <laugh>. Yeah. Remember, you know, really awesome guys like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>And I would see guys like Phil and I was like, man, what a cool thing. What a cool gig. Yeah. Like he's, he gets to get up there and just talk about awesome gear. And then next thing I know, like I'm kind of doing that, right. And then suddenly I, I, I get hired by Ableton, and then I'm doing it for a specific company, and it just sort of ramped up from there. But those were good times and I, I, I still enjoy it. Like, I next month for that Berkeley event, for example, that's, that's kind of a reward for me being able to do something, having the privilege to be able to do that kind of stuff around what I do on a regular basis. You know, creating <span style="color:red" data-ts="902.025" data-end_ts="902.245" title="902.025" id=c_"902.025">__in__</span> this, you know, now creating sound, evangelizing Ableton live and push and showing things off, like favorite pieces of gear or modular gear or something on Instagram or whatever. It's like to be able to be in that environment, whether it's Berkeley or Mt SU or <span style="color:red" data-ts="919.375" data-end_ts="919.725" title="919.375" id=c_"919.375">__Frost__</span> School at Miami University or whatever. It's like, those are the environments that I really enjoy getting up and talking and presenting and moderating or whatever. That's good stuff. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, one of the things I always did like is the way that you brought kind of a real practical, I, I never felt like, like you were following a script, rather, I felt like you were sharing experiences. That's actually why I was looking forward to our, our discussion today. Because, you know, even when you're doing presentations, there was a clear sense that you had, you had a background doing this stuff. And when, when people would come to you and, and they would be like, you know, yeah, I'm, you know, I'm stuck in the middle of the production booth all day long. As much as I'd like to learn about some of this other tweaky stuff, I need to get shit done. How do I get shit done? And you had the experience and the comfort with the product. Just be able to say, well, you could try this, you could try that. You were always, you always had that kind of advice right at hand, which was really unusual in comparison to a lot of the other presenters I saw who were so focused on nailing the script that they didn't really have an opportunity in their spiel to take two minutes out to talk about a specific scenario. Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b><affirmative>. Yeah. The dog and pony 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Syndrome. Right, right. And 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>I, yeah, you know, I looked <span style="color:red" data-ts="1001.345" data-end_ts="1001.565" title="1001.345" id=c_"1001.345">__at__</span> you kind of bringing those points forward while you're talking about that, it makes me kind of reflect back on sort of key points and key moments. And I think a lot of it is being really fortunate to have experienced the kinds of, scenarios and environments that I grew up in, per se. Mm-Hmm. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1023.025" data-end_ts="1023.065" title="1023.025" id=c_"1023.025">__<affirmative>__</span> in the studio world. And a lot of that was predominantly in the nineties. I mean, I, I, there's some really interesting things that kind of happened in the late eighties, you know, kind of as I started discovering standalone sequencers with computers and, and sort of upping my game personally, but industry-wise, you know, really diving into, producing, like I was talking about earlier, the session, the session player arranger aspect. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know, and making a living doing that. I mean, that's all I did was I just live in a studio and I'd get a, a note or a call, you know, back in those days, you know, it's just, I get a, get the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1064.785" data-end_ts="1064.945" title="1064.785" id=c_"1064.785">__voice__</span>, get the, the message, and it's like, Hey, we need you in LA on Friday. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>You know, you've got this pro this, you know, MC a's doing this new project with, you know, this producer and this producer and Teddy Riley needs you here for this. And so my, I would ship the gear, I'd ship my synthesizers and ship my gear, and I'd go and I'd, you know, dive in and I would do that stuff. But, and it was the interesting thing is the, is this, I keep coming back to it. It's multitasking. Yeah. And you can <span style="color:red" data-ts="1092.085" data-end_ts="1092.325" title="1092.085" id=c_"1092.085">__kind__</span>, you know, you sort of, sort of like a innate rhythm characteristic. Like you kind of got that, or you kind of don't. And if you don't have it, it kind of comes across kind of fakey. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>Right. It's like, like when you go to these shows or you see someone demoing products and it's that tandem thing, and like, like you and I, for example, it's like, you're, you're behind the computer and I'm on stage <laugh>, and it's like, it's like, well, I don't know Darwin, what would happen if we open that track? And it's like, well, it's a good point, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1122.495" data-end_ts="1122.775" title="1122.495" id=c_"1122.495">__Houston__</span>, let's open that up and take a look. And it's like, well, great. So now we can see that the waveforms expanded into the right. It's like, it's like, it's so rehearsed and it's so, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1131.875" data-end_ts="1132.095" title="1131.875" id=c_"1131.875">__and__</span>, and that works for some people. But it, I think there are two ways to kind of look at this. You have the enormous crowded, noisy, or show floor aspect environment, and then you have like the presentation university level TEDx slash thing where it's, it's a little bit more in your face, like, kinda like workshops. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, I always, I always think, think of it as being like <span style="color:red" data-ts="1161.175" data-end_ts="1161.295" title="1161.175" id=c_"1161.175">__a__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1161.495" data-end_ts="1161.615" title="1161.495" id=c_"1161.495">__a__</span> kind of two different points. One of 'em is communicating. So sometimes you need to have a highly re rehearsed thing so that you can communicate the information that has to get out in a specific amount of time. But I think the other, there's another thing that has to be done or should be done, which is connecting with people. Right. And if you're so heavily rehearsed that you can't connect it, that's where you end up with sort of like this feeling of, wow, I just watched, I just watched a puppet. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>There's a, a person I used to work with, you're acquainted with him too. His name's Dave Hill. Dave's an industry veteran. He's been around forever. He <span style="color:red" data-ts="1197.135" data-end_ts="1197.215" title="1197.135" id=c_"1197.135">__is__</span> a, a big primary reason that I became involved with, with Ableton from the get go. Dave was basically managed the US team. And so my role as a clinician was to get out there and hit the trenches. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="1210.295" data-end_ts="1210.375" title="1210.295" id=c_"1210.295">__then__</span> when I say hit the trenches, I mean like out in it, like from the retail front to workshops to today I am in Austin, Texas doing a workshop at this place. And then tonight I'm gonna be up in, in Dallas doing, you know, and it's like, it could be a room of 20 people, it could be a room of five people. Right? But that's where you had to really connect, especially with a product like live in the early days where it had this whole it DJ moniker attached to it slash I have no idea what the hell's going on <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>I, I, I look, it's like, Hey, bro, I've got live and I really appreciate your presentation. I have it on my computer, but it, it doesn't make sense. Right. And, and be able to spend 90 seconds or five minutes or whatever with that person and connecting and making eye contact and like really have an interest in like, what they have to say. You know, and being able to sort of disseminate between those individuals. And then, like I said, the the grumpy, the grumpy guy, right. You know, or girl like that are sort of like, eh, it's just, it's just like, look, let's talk about it. Or we need to move on. But it's those individuals that over the years that I would have these conversations was, I, I think that's what sort of builds that confidence on stage as a presenter to be able to stop on a dime and then focus on a specific situation. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>Right. That, that hopefully will open up into more conversation. And sometimes I, I talk about it that way too. I'm say, well, let's, let's wait a second. Let's talk to Jake about what he was saying about foot control as a guitar player and be able to just punch in his vocals with, you know, with a foot controller. Because I think that's important. And then you sort of take that instead of just like, well, let, the easy route is always, well, great question, Jake, look, come up to me after the event. Yeah. And we'll, it's like, really, it's bullshit. It's like, right. I mean, it's, those are, those are the important things. And, and I, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1318.445" data-end_ts="1318.845" title="1318.445" id=c_"1318.445">__getting__</span> back to, like, with Dave, it was like Dave used to always sort of instill that. He was like, you know, it's okay man, if you just take a second, take a breath and just, you know, focus on if you need to break it down into two actual scenarios. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>Especially with Ableton, because live works in so many capacities, as we all know. You don't even have to go down that road. But, you know, performance, home recording, studio performance, you know, all this kind of stuff. And so I sort of, again, really fortunate with the background that I have a lot of situations where just, again, I, I can't stress it enough. I've just been really fortunate to have great mentors. Really lifetime moments where it was like, I'm, I'm watching these pros do this stuff, and I'm sitting next to someone making this record. Dave Sada or whoever, you know, these are friends of mine that I can look back on. I go, man, I learned a lot from Dave. Yeah. Just on that, those vocal tracking sessions, being a, a producer or a session guy, watching them work. And it's, and then that led led me into producing for a decade or so in Atlanta bands, solo artists, all that kind of stuff. Instrumental records, just producing and creating and working in all types of different studio scenarios, from big rooms to small rooms, to designing rooms, to building rigs. I think that all kind of comes into play on that. And I, and, and it's fun to look back on those times. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Let's actually do that because we've like laid down several, breadcrumb trails to your history. And, you know, I've heard little sprinklings of it over the years, so I, I know maybe a little more, but let's, let's actually jump in <span style="color:red" data-ts="1413.685" data-end_ts="1413.805" title="1413.685" id=c_"1413.685">__a__</span> way back machine. And let's talk about, first of all, how you got started in music, but then especially how you got started in your, in the professional world. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>Well, there's not a lot of exciting information in the early days. 'cause I'm not that kid who had the piano in the house, but I am that, you know, in lessons and that kind of stuff. But I am the kid who had a musical household. And that is a incredibly strong fond memory for me in my upbringing, is that we had a stereo in the living room. I had a stereo, my parents had a stereo. There was, there was cassette players everywhere. And it was just music. There was always music. My mom had her thing on kind of the pop stuff. And my dad had his jazz stuff. And I think one of my earliest memories that, and my parents used to reflect on this as, as I got older through the years, is that gave me sort of the idea that this might be something I want to do was sort of this abstract arc around music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>And that was more of the broadcasting radio type <span style="color:red" data-ts="1475.845" data-end_ts="1475.965" title="1475.845" id=c_"1475.845">__a__</span> side of things. And I used to, I had this little Sony cassette deck and I would, you know, record things off the radio or whatever, favorite songs. And this is, I'm like 8, 9, 10 years old. But I used to basically hock my parents' cassette player from their room or from upstairs. And I would take that and I would actually overdub back and forth. So I'd take one cassette and I'd put it in and put the other cassette in the other machine. I'd record something off my stereo, off my records. But I would actually do a radio show. It's kinda like you, it's sort of like the Darwin thing. And I'd be like, Hey, that's, Elton John <laugh>. Someone would say, my life tonight and this is Houston on w <span style="color:red" data-ts="1513.945" data-end_ts="1514.165" title="1513.945" id=c_"1513.945">__da__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1514.165" data-end_ts="1514.285" title="1514.165" id=c_"1514.165">__da__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1514.285" data-end_ts="1514.405" title="1514.285" id=c_"1514.285">__da__</span>, whatever. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="1515.165" data-end_ts="1515.325" title="1515.165" id=c_"1515.165">__then__</span>, but I would record that to the other machine and I would put that back and I would make these tapes and I would go multi-track back and forth, and then I'd get the guitar and I'd play little, little notes or whatever. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>But there was never, it was never really afforded a piano or any real instruments until I was around 12 and I got a drum kit. 'cause I really wanted to be a, a rock and roll drummer and a cool band. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. 'cause it was the, the age old story, you know, it's like, man, I could play drums. I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1538.645" data-end_ts="1538.725" title="1538.645" id=c_"1538.645">__could__</span> be cool, I can meet girls, I can be in a band. And you know, I played in these really shitty bands in high school, junior high. I didn't even play in high school 'cause we were so crappy. Right. But I could keep a beat, but I don't think anyone else could keep a beat in the band. So we were just sort of like, I don't even think we had a name. It was just sort of like, but that kind of carried me through high school. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>But my senior year, 'cause now I'm reflecting back on this a little bit. I, I had this friend named Jim Shear, and Jim was a, was a year in front of me. And he was a, he was a musician and he was, you know, he was an e theory <span style="color:red" data-ts="1568.605" data-end_ts="1568.725" title="1568.605" id=c_"1568.605">__in__</span> Harmony class. And he would take all these classes and he was this really cool guy. And we were, so I was a junior and he was a senior, but I, I don't know why he did this, but throughout our friendship, he would give me prior, issues of Keyboard magazine and Mixed Magazine and he'd be like, man, you're gonna love this. You should read this. 'cause I guess he'd figured out that I really had a, I really enjoyed 'cause of my music collection and the things I collected and on record or vinyl and cassette and things like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>So I used to read these magazines and it was fascinated to read about <span style="color:red" data-ts="1601.425" data-end_ts="1601.645" title="1601.425" id=c_"1601.425">__TAM__</span> and all these different, you know, Larry Fast and all this kind of stuff. And I'm like, man, these guys are, it's Keith Emerson. This is crazy. This is so cool. Look at these big giant synthesizers. And I'm like, oh my god, $7,000. I can't get one of those. Right. Okay. You know, it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1615.565" data-end_ts="1615.605" title="1615.565" id=c_"1615.565">__not__</span>, you're gonna go upstairs at the breakfast table. And it's like, mom, I was kind of thinking instead of that bike, I'd like this, mo this rolling system 100 that, you know, it's like, this is not gonna happen <laugh>. But, but I, I attribute that to, to my buddy Jim. And Jim went on to MTSU and has a formidable recording career now and all kinds of other stuff. I look back on that and I, and it was at that moment that in the back of my mind was like, you know, I'll do the thing and I'll, I'll get into college and I'll lay these foundations what I think is the right thing to do, but I really want to get into this recording scene. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>And I did everything I could to get into any studio or any sort of like musician circle, right. Both summer after high school and in <span style="color:red" data-ts="1664.235" data-end_ts="1664.525" title="1664.235" id=c_"1664.235">__coll__</span> in college, first two years of college, I, I would go to these, I'd go to the music lab and fiddle around with these like PAA kits and things like that Right. To make these extraordinarily horrible noises and sounds and, and fidget around with rolling JX PS and all this kind of stuff. And DX sevens and, but it's, it started to grow from right there. And so fast forward a little bit, you know, I, I finally was able to afford myself my first synth, which 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Was what 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>You would think well, you know, was what was it like a, a awesome Rollin or? It was a, a Yamaha DX 21. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>Okay. The Poor Man's DX seven. Right. And I took that thing and I took a Q <span style="color:red" data-ts="1705.835" data-end_ts="1705.995" title="1705.835" id=c_"1705.835">__Tech__</span> four track and I sat in my apartment in college and I would play, I would just make tapes <span style="color:red" data-ts="1710.825" data-end_ts="1711.115" title="1710.825" id=c_"1710.825">__that__</span> would just multi-track all day with it. And then I got a drum machine and I got a little tiny Yamaha drum machine and I would figure out sync. And I figured this out and I figured out sort of the basics of arranging and what a chorus was. Okay, four bars. Now I'm <span style="color:red" data-ts="1723.275" data-end_ts="1723.315" title="1723.275" id=c_"1723.275">__gonna__</span> do this. A bars change the pattern. And these were the days when you would step in your, your patterns and you would make these grooves. And it was, it was pretty horrible to me. It was amazing. But looking back on it, it was just sort of like a real simple scenario with a very simple set of tools. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>But I was incredibly passionate about it. And when I would share that passion with like my parents, my, you know, my mom and dad were incredibly supportive. You know, they were like, look, you know, sounds this, I'm sure it was probably a little bit of BSS in there as I'd come home with Thanksgiving and play these horrible renditions of <laugh> Gary Newman or something that I would sort of try to emulate on, you know, and they were like, Hey, okay, well we're proud of you. Keep it up. We're not gonna pay for any of this. Right, right. You know, but we, we'll pay for your books in school, but none of this music stuff, it's cool though. It's, it's keep at it. I did stick with it. And 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Did you share it beyond, like with your parents and like maybe your roommate? I mean, were you ever part of like, the cassette culture or any of tho that kind of thing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>Some, yeah. Somewhat. 'cause I worked, the other thing is I, I, again, going back to this whole music background of just musicology and like <span style="color:red" data-ts="1792.585" data-end_ts="1792.805" title="1792.585" id=c_"1792.585">__the__</span> recordings, I, I worked part-time <span style="color:red" data-ts="1796.305" data-end_ts="1796.525" title="1796.305" id=c_"1796.305">__and__</span> even full-time in a, in a record store as well. Oh, okay. A couple record stores. So I was that, I was that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1801.265" data-end_ts="1801.485" title="1801.265" id=c_"1801.265">__guy__</span>. You're that guy. I was, that I was that kid. So I was like, Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know, college radio Saturday from two to four, you know, making mix tapes, doing this, trying to, you know, having an understanding of, you know, everything from who's producing records to where these, where the culture lies regionally. Like, oh, there's this REM thing getting ready to happen. What's going on here? Hey, it's this, you know, electronic stuff, pop stuff. And, but my music that I was creating, and it was starting to grow a little bit, you know, I got, you know, effect box and an SPX 90 and I would start to build my little studio like we all did back in the eighties. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> man, you would, you <span style="color:red" data-ts="1837.125" data-end_ts="1837.205" title="1837.125" id=c_"1837.125">__would__</span> kind of maybe stack and present a little bit more than you needed to. It's like a digital alarm clock on top of the drum machine <laugh>, and, you know what I mean? It's like the extra speaker on top of the other speaker that wasn't really on. And people come over and they're like, oh man, cool. What, what are all <span style="color:red" data-ts="1852.045" data-end_ts="1852.125" title="1852.045" id=c_"1852.045">__those__</span>? It's like, well, yeah, I'm doing this and you'd play your amazing creation of sequence like pattern. But you know, it, something was there because I stuck with it, man. And I, I just, I kept at it. I kept at it. And that's when things started to open up a little bit in the late, right around 1991, I'd say. And I'd made the transition to Atlanta, Georgia, and it was an incredibly vibrant music scene at that time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>There's a lot of things kind of exploding on the, on the radar as far as cultural, you know, the RB thing and the hip, all this hip hop stuff. And, and I just started hanging in circles with these folks. I don't even really know how it started. It just, next thing I know, I'm in the studio, different studio scenarios, but I happen to be alongside this other gentleman named Rick Shepherd, sort of the go-to synth programmer drum machine guys. Like, Hey, call, call them. They'll come in and, and help salvage this session because they have this thing that they can do that samples these vocals and like lays 'em out to where we can and move 'em around. Do do this and do that and Yeah. Call Houston. And so anyway, I started getting these calls and, and I took advantage of it. 'cause at that time I was sort of, you know, figuring things out and I was working and everything was okay in that regard. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>But I was still like burning the midnight oil, like in the studio at night. And I was like, hustling. That's really the best way to put it. I was just doing the hustle, trying to wrap my head around ways to buy more gear and more gear and this and that. And, and so it was in those circles, it was in those impromptu sessions that would come up quickly and getting through those sessions and the multitasking factor and being able to work on a dime. And sometimes I get paid, sometimes I wouldn't get paid. Sometimes I would use a certain session to vault into meeting someone else. Right, right. You know, and I would get that call. It's like, the way I, I sort of put that is like leaving the door cracked a little bit, as I used to say. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> is like, you're in a studio where there's multiple studios, but you crack your door a little bit to let some of your sounds sort of drift out in the hall. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>Yeah. So that a-list producer might be coming out of the, a room down the hall and sort of hear your groove. And it worked. Like guys would come in and they'd kind of knock on the, he'd say, Hey man, what's, what's happening? What <span style="color:red" data-ts="1980.965" data-end_ts="1981.045" title="1980.965" id=c_"1980.965">__are__</span> you, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1981.125" data-end_ts="1981.285" title="1981.125" id=c_"1981.125">__what__</span>, what's that? What's that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1982.935" data-end_ts="1983.285" title="1982.935" id=c_"1982.935">__koder__</span> thing? It's like, oh, I'm just working on some stuff, you know? And next thing you know, I'm in a session with some ridiculous artists like Bell biv Devo or something laying down a, a snare track or whatever. Or just, it's just really crazy stuff. But it, that's the early, that's sort of that early sort of budding entry into going completely crazy in the nineties on synthesis and like really digging in and getting, you know, being able afford myself to have better gear and be able to, to discover the world of MOG for real and discover the world of Roland like on a real tip. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>As opposed to just perusing in a music store. Right. Or trying to bamboozle my way to a someone to like, Hey, I'll trade, I'll trade you 16 of these for you <span style="color:red" data-ts="2026.845" data-end_ts="2027.045" title="2026.845" id=c_"2026.845">__Roland__</span> D 50. Right. I mean, those were, you know, I remember the day I walked into a music store and laid down close to $4,000 on an <span style="color:red" data-ts="2034.885" data-end_ts="2035.045" title="2034.885" id=c_"2034.885">__AKA__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2035.045" data-end_ts="2035.205" title="2035.045" id=c_"2035.045">__and__</span> PC 60 the original. Yeah. Like just, I had waited and I waited and I finally had the money and I bought it. 'cause I knew that's what I wanted. This was like 1991, I think. And I would, there weren't many people that had those. And that was a game changer for me. And then right after that, someone had handed me a, a demo license disc for op code vision. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> between the MPC 60 and Vision on my Mac se which at that time I was only really using as a flight simulator or something like. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>Right, right. Really it was just sort of sat in the studio to prepare invoices. It wasn't really, I think I had Master Tracks pro on there or something, but it was kind of like, I'd sort of dick with it. But I was really more into like hardware stuff. And man, MPC is most original MPC users will tell you there was a workflow that just worked. It was really magical. And it was the, the process of how I always say is how the hands laid. Yep. It's where your hands fell on that unit. And it's changed ergonomically over the years, obviously. But it's like, it's, what's funny is now that it's sort of like it used to be Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2098.365" data-end_ts="2098.485" title="2098.365" id=c_"2098.365">__C__</span> live, but that, that's another conversation. But the, but that MPC was fantastic and it taught me sequencing and it taught me, or techniques for sequencing, it really engaged me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>And then I was able to take something like op code's vision, which had that same sensibility as in regards to stepping sequences together. Yes. In any way that you wanted to. So you could take sequence C twice, play sequence a once, tap, tap, tap, go to sequence E twice and back to to C and then play it back. And your magical thing would happen. And it was like, well that freaking worked and that would motivate me to just burn the candle. And I, I don't think I slept from <laugh> 1889 to like 95 or nine six or something. I just, all <span style="color:red" data-ts="2142.685" data-end_ts="2142.805" title="2142.685" id=c_"2142.685">__I__</span> did was work. And I think that's a big, you know, the 10,000 hour Yeah. Yeah. Thing like that's that's that's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's real for you. Huh? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>I got that one. You know, it's, yeah. And I preach that, you know, it's like, get your 10 K. Yeah. But when you, if you really wanna have a conversation and break it down, I can, I'll break it down for you. 'cause there's sure, like yourself and me and other people that <span style="color:red" data-ts="2162.085" data-end_ts="2162.245" title="2162.085" id=c_"2162.085">__are__</span> kind of grew up in that era where we transitioned from standalone hardware to suddenly onboard sequencing things like Corgan ones and pioneering stuff to, to digital works, audio workstations. Like Yeah, we saw all that. We were syncing stuff up back in the day. And 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, well the other thing though, back in the day was that you, you sort of were stuck with having to spend a lot of time with the gear that you bought. Right? I mean, unless you really did have limitless money, what you tended to do is you tended to buy one piece and you learned every in idiosyncratic corner of it, you know. So it's interesting you talk about the MPCs 'cause that was one of my things. Although one of the things that's funny to me is that everybody who's like an MPC head for them, the actual best MPC ever was the first one that they had. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2212.865" data-end_ts="2213.085" title="2212.865" id=c_"2212.865">__Oh__</span>, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>So Darwin, I still have that MPC Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Do you really? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>That's, it's in a case, my friend Peter Jacobson has it, Uhhuh <affirmative>. It's, it, he and I shared some studio space back in the day. He, yeah. It's still attainable. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2224.705" data-end_ts="2224.925" title="2224.705" id=c_"2224.705">__Oh__</span>, that's awesome. It's a pa It's, it's, I'm telling you, it's like, that was a, it was a stalwart piece. Like I remember everything about it. That piece was so early and so ahead of its game that you actually had to take a floppy disc and put it in and enter a whole bunch of numbers just so you could go into like local mode <laugh>. Like it wouldn't, it was, it, it was ahead, it didn't know what to do with itself. Right. Outside of its inert ability inside the box. And so when you would want to connect a Corgan one or a TR 7 0 7 or <span style="color:red" data-ts="2255.845" data-end_ts="2256.005" title="2255.845" id=c_"2255.845">__what__</span>, whatever, you'd have to sort of do all these things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>But when you got it, it was, it still came down to just sequencing and stepping things together in this elegant way as opposed to pushing 10, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2267.895" data-end_ts="2268.245" title="2267.895" id=c_"2267.895">__enter__</span>, enter, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2268.485" data-end_ts="2268.765" title="2268.485" id=c_"2268.485">__enter__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2268.765" data-end_ts="2269.005" title="2268.765" id=c_"2268.765">__enter__</span>, push, enter, you know, the rolling mc five hundreds, the QX seven Yamahas, all that stuff that probably <span style="color:red" data-ts="2274.365" data-end_ts="2274.565" title="2274.365" id=c_"2274.365">__hack__</span> your listeners on this podcast right now are probably Googling right now.

It was this one of these pieces that was always there to save your ass in the studio. It was called a Russian dragon. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, the Russian dragon. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>Do you remember the Russian dragon? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, you bet. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>That shows you the era and the, and the sheer amount of like, chaos we had to deal with of like, okay man, are we ready? Hold on a second. Is the Atari Okay, good. Did you strip a track? No, you gotta strip two tracks, dude. 'cause it's gonna bleed. Okay. Alright. We're ready. Okay. Go. And you would go and you would like, please, please don't get, get outta sync. Don't get outta sync. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="2316.58" data-end_ts="2316.7" title="2316.58" id=c_"2316.58">__it__</span> would get stay in sync. You're like, yes. Pass number one, the label's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Gonna happen. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>Yeah. And 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You know, it's, yeah, it was like, it was like one out of four tracks would actually say sync through the whole run 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>It. But the MPC was a magical piece. I knew that's what I wanted. I I saved all my money. But what's what's interesting is it wasn't too far after that that my buddy Randy was walked in my studio. And at that time I probably had 40, 50 synthesizers on the walls. And it was this massive setup and I was just working, working, working. But I was in pc, Randy, this jazz player friend of mine walked in, formal jazz player, heavy Cat comes in and he's like, Hey, I have this extra install of this sequencer for the max called Vision. You should, you, you need to check this out. And I'm like, well, I got Max <span style="color:red" data-ts="2362.565" data-end_ts="2363.005" title="2362.565" id=c_"2362.565">__Attracts__</span> pro. And he's like, no, no, no, no, no. Totally different game. And that was it. And I think according to Paul Benedictus at Op Code, I was the last user that I hung on <span style="color:red" data-ts="2374.925" data-end_ts="2375.085" title="2374.925" id=c_"2374.925">__to__</span> the very end. It's like 2002 mm-Hmm. <affirmative> something. That's how, and that's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2378.245" data-end_ts="2378.325" title="2378.245" id=c_"2378.245">__what__</span> you talk about MPC Legion. Yeah. The op code Vision Legion of users out there. Yeah. Who some of 'em probably listening right now. That's that's a group. That's a group that I like to get together for a big breakfast one day. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That would be a hoot, wouldn't it? And 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>Get Dave Oppenheimer and all the guy, the creator, and we all just get it and we just reflect. Yeah. We just like, 'cause that was the game change. I mean, mo two performer absolutely. Stalworth piece, you know, that's carried through in those days too. But man, something about Vision. Vision, actually, Darwin, I'll be honest with you, vision actually kept me focused on this career. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>And moved me <span style="color:red" data-ts="2415.625" data-end_ts="2415.845" title="2415.625" id=c_"2415.625">__con__</span> it it, as opposed to sort of maybe moving into some other areas of, still related to this field. But it was like vision kept me glued in the studio. It kept me in my chair <span style="color:red" data-ts="2425.705" data-end_ts="2425.925" title="2425.705" id=c_"2425.705">__and__</span> burning the candle. I'm just trying to figure out new ways to, to sort of branch into other areas and 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, one of the things, yeah. One of the things I felt with, with, studio vision was it actually, it was the thing that kept me making music instead of just evolving into sound design. Right. Because with samplers and synth setups and all that kind of stuff and, you know, turbo vision and, and all this, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2454.905" data-end_ts="2455.125" title="2454.905" id=c_"2454.905">__or__</span> turbo Turbo synth. Yeah. Turbo synth. Right. But, with Turbo Synth and those kind of things, I mean, I would've dove off into, you know, that little patio where, the people that drool on their chest live as they <span style="color:red" data-ts="2471.065" data-end_ts="2471.485" title="2471.065" id=c_"2471.065">__design__</span> the next sound. Right. But there was something about vision and especially this ability to integrate your midi <span style="color:red" data-ts="2477.845" data-end_ts="2478.005" title="2477.845" id=c_"2477.845">__work__</span> with your audio work. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, I too, you know, had a hardware background. And so there was, there was a sense where it felt really similar to that in a way that performer didn't to me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>Yeah. Well, I, I wasn't really afforded performer. I, I, I, sometimes I reflect on this in conversation too. Randy May have walked in with performer that day. Yeah. You know what I mean? Been a different person. It's funny how we <span style="color:red" data-ts="2502.275" data-end_ts="2502.765" title="2502.275" id=c_"2502.275">__changed__</span>. It's of, and that's sort of life. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. That person you meet is the one, you know, or whatever. Sure. And that sort of changed, but it's like, it was vision for me and, and it just, yeah. I, I just, I think too, I was very much into the OMS, the open music system capacity that they, that they offered with that program. And basically for anybody that's curious, what that allowed you to do was have this seamless integration of midi addressing your MIDI from your desktop. So you could have six synthesizers on a wall stacked up, zoned out, and then stacked or synced to something else, all within a single name. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>And so I could, I could create these monstrous patches and all this stuff. Like the midi memory mode layered with the rolling J 800 with the Kauai G mega module made this crazy ethereal space pad. But it was just named Space Pad. Right. And you could click, but, but because of that, and I still have the old patch sheets for this, and this is what I was referring to <span style="color:red" data-ts="2563.715" data-end_ts="2563.915" title="2563.715" id=c_"2563.715">__it__</span>, Paul Benedictus had told me that that OMS rig was so large that it just, I used to fax it, we used to fax it back and forth <laugh> to op code, and I think they were in Cupertino or somewhere. And we would, I would send it to those guy and they're like, oh my God, <laugh>, this is the biggest, this is like 160 different things going on. I'm like, yeah, dude. But it, 'cause there was just a few of us really doing that stuff on that level. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2586.435" data-end_ts="2586.755" title="2586.435" id=c_"2586.435">__There__</span> was, Mike McKnight was kind of doing the LA thing. I was doing the Atlanta thing. There was, Donald Parks doing the thing in New York. And so we all were sort of these programmer guys Right. That were just completely off our rocker on midi. Like, it was just insane. And, but it was like, but op <span style="color:red" data-ts="2602.795" data-end_ts="2603.035" title="2602.795" id=c_"2602.795">__code__</span>. And so when they went away in that big fiasco back, you know, a decade and a half ago or whatever, right. You know, they just retired. They just went away. A lot of people's like, look back on that. It's like, well, they were bought out and it got screwed up. It just, we moved on. I think for me it was logic, you know, and for a little while, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2619.875" data-end_ts="2620.115" title="2619.875" id=c_"2619.875">__Yeah__</span>, it was, it was logic for <span style="color:red" data-ts="2620.995" data-end_ts="2621.075" title="2620.995" id=c_"2620.995">__me__</span> for a while too. But I'll tell you, I was not nearly as productive until Ableton came along. Yeah. Because, yeah, right there. It, it just never clicked with me in a way. And then Ableton came along and it kind of had that, that kind of feeling too. But before we go too far down that road, despite the fact that you had this enormous rig, first of all, you're based out of Atlanta, which I assume you were primarily doing, doing hip hop gigs then, right? Or, and probably like, like commercial and jingle type stuff too. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>It's kind of, well, it's interesting, you know, Atlanta and still is to this day, Atlanta was also a very formidable, multimedia centric town. 'cause we had CNN and Turner. Right, of course. And so there were guys, I can name them too. I mean, there was a, on one hand there were guys who were totally into that craft and they were, they, they were nailing the, the multimedia stuff internally for like CNN and Turner and the, and the budding era of Cartoon Network and all that kind of stuff. But musically, the landscape was definitely hip hop. It was that whole kind of the birth of the new Jack Swing era. Right. And Dallas, Austin, Jermaine Dupree and, and all that kind of stuff. And, and, and TLC. And I'll tell you what the game Changer was for the Atlanta scene and also for me was when La Reed and Babyface and LaFace music moved to when they relocated to Atlanta and they brought MCA records with them. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>And so under MCA and Universal, that opened up a lot of work for folks like me. But I had also established a really good relationship with, with Babyface and Darrell Simmons through an individual named Donald Parks, who was their programmer. Okay. Who was another mentor of mine. Different capacity and different approach to doing sound design and doing MIDI work and things like that. But that's got me a ton of opportunities to be in studio scenarios where, and sometimes where I wasn't even really working, I was just sort of there as a, as a backup or to help or something where it was like, Hey, can you bring your MK S 80? We want to stack that with this thing, can we? And it's like, yeah, I'll just bring it down. I'll hang out <span style="color:red" data-ts="2743.525" data-end_ts="2743.645" title="2743.525" id=c_"2743.525">__and__</span> I'd just hang out. But I'd watch and I'd listen and I'd watch guys like Dave Sato or John Gas or Dave <span style="color:red" data-ts="2749.405" data-end_ts="2749.605" title="2749.405" id=c_"2749.405">__Wade__</span> or these guys like sitting next to them in a console and just kind of going, huh. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>So you actually create an Uggs and you print that, but you actually leave one channel free for. Okay. And I sort of make these mental notes on like, Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I see what you're doing there. And I would take that and I would, microphone technique microphones, like different ways those were used. Miking a piano, miking, a vocal miking a guitar. And I would take those attributes and I would go back to my studio and I have a big passion for, for guitar. That's one of my favorite things in the world to record and to work with and interact with. And I would use miking techniques on vocals and guitars. It's the same way that I would see these individuals using it in these major sessions. And so my sessions, I mean, they weren't small or tiny or regardless, but they certainly weren't in the capacity of $2,000 a day productions. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>Right. You know, but I would take that and I was like, okay, cool. I need to do my vocal booth like this, or I need to up my game with a synchronizer this way. Right. Or maybe I don't need this. And it was, it was interesting. The Atlanta landscape, again, really fortunate because that was a really heavy time in Atlanta <span style="color:red" data-ts="2818.385" data-end_ts="2818.605" title="2818.385" id=c_"2818.385">__at__</span> 92 to around 98, I wanna say in there <span style="color:red" data-ts="2821.165" data-end_ts="2821.485" title="2821.165" id=c_"2821.165">__place__</span> was blowing up. Yeah. It was crazy. And I was right smack in the middle of it. And to this day, there's a circle of us, a good dozen or so, maybe a little few more. We're all still doing the thing. And we are in touch, we're in touch through <span style="color:red" data-ts="2833.845" data-end_ts="2834.005" title="2833.845" id=c_"2833.845">__ris__</span>. We're in touch through different guilds. And we organizations we're, we're in touch and we're like, Hey man, how's the studio? Or Hey, what are you doing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>And it's like, you know, this person's still working with Elton John <span style="color:red" data-ts="2842.425" data-end_ts="2842.645" title="2842.425" id=c_"2842.425">__and__</span> still a person's still engineering this. And, and it's Oh, that's cool. It's a good family. It's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2847.045" data-end_ts="2847.085" title="2847.045" id=c_"2847.045">__a__</span>, so to answer your question, it was, I found myself in the hip hop <span style="color:red" data-ts="2850.565" data-end_ts="2850.845" title="2850.565" id=c_"2850.565">__sort__</span>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2850.845" data-end_ts="2851.125" title="2850.845" id=c_"2850.845">__What__</span>? Really? It was more <span style="color:red" data-ts="2851.845" data-end_ts="2851.965" title="2851.845" id=c_"2851.845">__r__</span> hip hop wasn't even the thing. It was <span style="color:red" data-ts="2854.205" data-end_ts="2854.325" title="2854.205" id=c_"2854.205">__real__</span>. I wasn't <span style="color:red" data-ts="2854.685" data-end_ts="2854.805" title="2854.685" id=c_"2854.685">__when__</span> the r <span style="color:red" data-ts="2855.085" data-end_ts="2855.205" title="2855.085" id=c_"2855.085">__and__</span> b scene as a session player Mm-Hmm. And as a programmer. And I made a living doing that. But I was also a record producer in my own environment working with singer songwriters, doing a lot of pop stuff. And I was recording instrumental music with a lot of guitarists and violinists and doing instrumental records and then putting my flavor underneath and creating these sort of modern, classical instrumental pro projects out of my studio. And it was like, I was afforded a great opportunity, 'cause I developed a decade plus relationship with a guy named Paul Diaz who owned a studio named Tree Sound. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>And we sort of built this studio up, but I had part of that facility as my own. So I had two SSL rooms to my left and right. And I'm upstairs in my room, you know, doing I think. So I was, and it was really, again, really fortunate thing. And I was able to maintain that relationship and foster that and be able to step outta my room, take the masters down, do a quick, do a quick tracking session in the A room, but then walk back upstairs to my studio. And I had that studio at about oh four. It was right around the time I started <span style="color:red" data-ts="2921.105" data-end_ts="2921.325" title="2921.105" id=c_"2921.105">__it__</span> live. And now a friend of mine runs that. But so it was a, it was a, it was a very diverse scene in Atlanta and it was broadcast, multimedia, hip hop, singer, songwriters. 'cause you gotta look at the, it's definitely in the earth in Georgia, you know, the Sean Mullins and rms and all this kind of, so it's more than just that huge budding RB scene. But it's, I think that mixture, and even today, so many formidable artists, formidable artists and producers are still in Atlanta or coming out of Atlanta that are paving the way, you know, still today. It's an, it's an interesting thing. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It is at, you know, at one point you're, you're running 40, 50, 60 cents, but that was also the timeframe when all of a sudden virtual instruments and virtualization in general gets to be the thing. Right. How hard was it for you, first of all, to make the transition from hardware guy to software guy? And secondly, did you bail on all the hardware or did you, did you keep it or did you put it in a storage container somewhere? How did you, how did you deal with that transition? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>That's a great way to put it. And that this sort of, I enjoy talking about this aspect because there's different ways to look at it from, from fanatical collector. I don't know what I'm doing aspect to true diehard synth purveyor back in the day still doing it, guy. Right? I know that's a lot of information, but I want to, I always earmark it as 2000 and I, and I also earmark that era of the software synth moniker as Apple Loops era. So it's like one day we're all in the studio and we're doing our thing and then suddenly there's this apple <span style="color:red" data-ts="3026.205" data-end_ts="3026.485" title="3026.205" id=c_"3026.205">__loop__</span> shit and it's like, what, what is it? What, what's going on? You can just drag this in and it just plays these awesome grooves. And it's like, yeah, cool. Let me, let me drag this Apple loop into track four against this pop tune and oh, okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>And then suddenly it's like, Hey, you know, there's this ESX ES one, or hey, there's this Rob <span style="color:red" data-ts="3045.055" data-end_ts="3045.405" title="3045.055" id=c_"3045.055">__Papin__</span> albino right thing check, or, or I think one of the early ones I remember was the Ovation base station or something like that. There was one, some kind of ovation plugin and it was cracked and everybody had it, the Jewel case with a Sharpie, serial code <laugh>. And it was kinda like, okay, I'll put this in. But I was a, I was an adopter to it, but I, it was very slow because I basically, at the end of the day, I, I was making a living and I had to work and it was like, I didn't really have time to sort of go, oh, cool, let's kick our feet up and dick around with this, this software synth. It's cool. You know, and I'm playing it and it's, it's, that's pretty nice. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>And I remember I would, I would kind of toy with it sort of, I, I envisioned probably the same way people sort of toy with Ableton when they first get it. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> put a couple clips in clip view session view launch a clip. Okay, that sounds cool. Now do what I do with it. And so that's, but I, but the jump was pretty quick. 'cause I real, I remember looking back on, albino for example. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> as an example. And the ES one, I didn't even think it was called the ES one back then 'cause it was still iMagic or something. But I remember tooling around with this from the sound design perspective and being such a huge fanatic of sound and, and synthesis. I actually got, got into it, it sounded different. And I, and I, and that connection between what's happening from the wrist down into the computer was, was definitely a disconnect as opposed to my hands on an OBX. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>Right. You know, or memory mode. Turning knobs and making obvious changes to my ears while I'm turning a knob. But it kind of didn't really matter at the end of the day because it, it sounded pretty good. I was sort of entertaining myself and I was, and then I found myself making presets, saving them. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and then going Dear Rob Paman, Hey man, I got these presets. You want 'em say Yeah, sure. Or Hey Greg Teague Emagic, do you want these presets on this ES one? I'm sticking around with it. You're welcome to have 'em. And I <span style="color:red" data-ts="3166.185" data-end_ts="3166.305" title="3166.185" id=c_"3166.185">__would__</span> sort of play with it, but nothing ever really got into my workflow. It was this sort of bastardized external thing. Oh, interesting. Like literal, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3174.305" data-end_ts="3174.425" title="3174.305" id=c_"3174.305">__I__</span> I hadn't really thought about that <span style="color:red" data-ts="3175.545" data-end_ts="3175.745" title="3175.545" id=c_"3175.545">__until__</span> you brought that question up. It's like they, I really didn't start incorporating, I'll frame it for you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>The timeframe around 2003, there was this plugin that came out. It was a beast of a plugin. It was called the Time Warp. 2,600. Yep. And it was this arp 2,600 emulation by this guy named Jim, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3191.005" data-end_ts="3191.225" title="3191.005" id=c_"3191.005">__he__</span> way out <span style="color:red" data-ts="3192.265" data-end_ts="3192.425" title="3192.265" id=c_"3192.265">__wear__</span> one. Right. Yeah. Way out <span style="color:red" data-ts="3193.945" data-end_ts="3194.145" title="3193.945" id=c_"3193.945">__where__</span> amazing, dev guy, just coder. And he's just, he made this thing and it was, it was great. And he emailed me or contacted me and he was like, Hey, I'm looking for guys to do some presets 'cause it's gonna debut it <span style="color:red" data-ts="3206.365" data-end_ts="3206.565" title="3206.365" id=c_"3206.365">__now__</span>, blah, blah, blah, whatever. And I was like, sure man, I'll do those for you. That sounds great. And he's, and I think back then he actually had to mail me the box. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. 'cause we didn't, you know, you couldn't download anything. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Not something that big. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>Right. Not, or whatever. So anyway, I remember that a bunch of the raw paper and stuff, a company called Sample Logic and a few others, I just started diving and exploring. It was more of an exploratory thing, but I really enjoyed it. But I, but they still, I could not get them involved in my production process. 'cause at that point I was like pro tools mixed with logic mixed with hardware. And I was just, I was working day to day. I was, you know, record label budgets, all this kind of stuff recording. And it was sort of like, eh, I'll get <span style="color:red" data-ts="3249.485" data-end_ts="3249.565" title="3249.485" id=c_"3249.485">__it__</span>, I'll get to that later. But then it just, like overnight, suddenly I found myself like, why wouldn't I put this tune track, easy drum <span style="color:red" data-ts="3257.605" data-end_ts="3257.765" title="3257.605" id=c_"3257.605">__or__</span> drum kit to replace these certain drum stems. Like, it just made sense. And it,

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's interesting for me to hear that it took so long for you to it to integrate into your thing because, and, and maybe it's because you were comfortable or, or the work environment that you'd gotten used to was different than mine. One of the reasons that I ended up jumping in quick was because the frustration of working on a track and then all of a sudden you get the call and, oh, I gotta work on this other track. So you reset everything and then you're going back to do the first track and you're like, okay, I gotta get my 20 cents back to what was the environment on that thing? Oh shit, that's never gonna happen. Yeah. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>Absolutely. Well, I think that is attainable to the type of hardware that you have. I mean, for me, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3305.865" data-end_ts="3306.085" title="3305.865" id=c_"3305.865">__as__</span>, as opposed to a piece of hardware that's total analog, non-control versus an MKS 70 with preset configuration. Right. So I could still get that call and say, okay, cool. Bank B patch 42, that was the base, the slippery base that was right. Okay, cool. As opposed to a memory mug, a profit five, a pro one, a modular, you know, whatever. Yeah, sure. I totally get that. Like, it's like, oh man, patch sheets everywhere. It's like, you know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And still it never <span style="color:red" data-ts="3335.085" data-end_ts="3335.285" title="3335.085" id=c_"3335.085">__was__</span>. You would always end up, because the, the problem with that was that in your head you would always think it sounded a whole lot better than it probably did. You know? So if you didn't burn, if you didn't lay down the track on the tape or onto a hard drive, absolutely. You inevitably would come back to it and you, you'd follow the patch sheet and you'd think that it's humping along, but you're like, yeah, but it was so much cooler. It, it had this like, breathing thing before and I can't get that back. And all this 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>Sucks. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="3360.925" data-end_ts="3361.205" title="3360.925" id=c_"3360.925">__look__</span>, so look back on, there was a time to look back at a time when we actually ran a free wheeled dat tape Yeah. To capture just case <span style="color:red" data-ts="3370.245" data-end_ts="3370.445" title="3370.245" id=c_"3370.245">__all__</span> the shit we were doing in the studio because of that reason. It's like just in 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Case, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>Hey, hey, what was two 30 today, man? What the, what? Remember that thing of the, it's like, yeah, go back on the, I swear to God we would run this and I still have these cases of dat tapes and zip drives and all these things and the gear locker just, I look at 'em and, and it says session one, six hour, blah, blah blah. And it's like, I gotta listen to this man. Yeah. Right. And it's just these spotty random with breaks in between of like, sounds <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="3399.145" data-end_ts="3399.365" title="3399.145" id=c_"3399.145">__And__</span> it <span style="color:red" data-ts="3399.525" data-end_ts="3399.605" title="3399.525" id=c_"3399.525">__is__</span>, and I probably should, I should probably incorporate that into my role now. It's like make some sample library of, of stuff. But, but today the modern version of that is when you, how many times you take out your iPhone and take a picture of your modular rig. Yeah. Right. You just do it and you know you're not gonna go look at that shit <laugh>, you know, when you snap that iPhone right. Of your three of that one space rack of the, of the patch cable, you're not gonna go back and look, go 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>No. Well and again, and even if you do, you're gonna have built up some kind of mythology that you're, that means that even if you exactly replicate it, you're still gonna believe that it's not the same. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>It's not. And that's a great point, what you said earlier, it's never, never quite the same maybe on a MiniMogue d or something may those, but when it comes to modular or something more expansive Yeah. Like where you have to, you take those patch sheets, we all have our method. It's kind of funny actually. It's somebody put out a small little book on it of like patch sheets from Darwin, pat sheets from <span style="color:red" data-ts="3458.785" data-end_ts="3459.005" title="3458.785" id=c_"3458.785">__da__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3459.005" data-end_ts="3459.165" title="3459.005" id=c_"3459.005">__da__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3459.165" data-end_ts="3459.285" title="3459.165" id=c_"3459.165">__da__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3459.505" data-end_ts="3459.725" title="3459.505" id=c_"3459.505">__to__</span> patch sheets. Like all the different ways that we, so you look at, it's just kind of hysterical. Yeah. It's like the, the person who's totally OCD on their patch sheets as opposed to the person like me who's just fly by the seat of his pants. Like, oh, you mark, mark, mark and then play it back three days later. You're like, no. Right. That is not the way that OBH should be sounding by any means. <laugh>, I think dynamics come into play there. Oh yeah. Because there's a lot of times where you've got your chain, your signal chain, and you're running some of this analog centric gear and you've gotta switch, you've gotta do something else. You're closing a session out, you come back to it, whether it's a personal session or, or work for hire. And it doesn't sound the same. It's like, you gotta look back. It's like, well, was that, what was I running that through? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Right. What was my gain setting on the channel when I, I split off into a pair of compressors? Was 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>I malting that amp? <span style="color:red" data-ts="3511.245" data-end_ts="3511.445" title="3511.245" id=c_"3511.245">__It__</span> was it, what, what, where was my mic pre? Shit, I can't tell you many times. I mean, do you really think how many people today are using wax pencils in their studio? It's just, it's not happening. It's just not happening. Right. It's not happening. It's like, it's all about saving those notes, which is great in the, in the computer. And you, just back to that original question you had on my transition. Eventually I just went full force and it was just like, this is just a mixture. And I wouldn't, and it wasn't until Ableton Live introduced the external instrument device, which allows you to basically merge an audio midi <span style="color:red" data-ts="3545.005" data-end_ts="3545.165" title="3545.005" id=c_"3545.005">__track__</span> into one. Right. With low latency granted, depending on your interface, I was able to do that. So now I can, and I have been for a decade plus, like able to mix and match dozens of pieces of analog synths and drum machines and modular gear, for example, you know, in live completely integrated, layered with not just virtual instruments, but editors. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>Like I treat device chains in live within a master device. Sometimes I have the editor in there as well, but a lot of the mug stuff, for example, so I can tweak a knob, it tweaks the parameter and the software version or the software <span style="color:red" data-ts="3582.205" data-end_ts="3582.445" title="3582.205" id=c_"3582.205">__live__</span> editor, and then that's all saved as an instrument rack. To me that's just, it's fascinating and it's fun and it's proactive. And if it could get me from point A to point B quicker, I'm all about it. Right. But at <span style="color:red" data-ts="3595.245" data-end_ts="3595.365" title="3595.245" id=c_"3595.245">__the__</span>, but in the end it comes down to the sound. I mean, it has, I have to have that passion for making that sound the way I want it. And if it's not right, I'm gonna go back and do it again. And now, especially making sound full-time, aside from doing it on the outside of that realm too, it's like the software instrument aspect of being able to save on the fly, save a different version even, and then come back later and mix and match and stack and change is a fantastic thing for me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>And it's only getting better the sound of some of the Yui products today and the sound of some of the raw paper and stuff like the Predator Two and that new pro one thing from u <span style="color:red" data-ts="3635.855" data-end_ts="3636.055" title="3635.855" id=c_"3635.855">__he__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3636.055" data-end_ts="3636.335" title="3636.055" id=c_"3636.055">__though__</span> you listen to that stuff, a keys scape, Omnisphere, it's like you listen to that stuff in a good room and people say system, I, I sort of attribute it to the room. You listen to that stuff on a good playback system and you're putting some force into playing those software instruments the right way. You, I mean it's to the point now to where it's just, it's unbelievable sounding. Yeah. Like if you can't make music now, you don't, you don't really have a lot of excuses now. It's sort of back in the day you could be like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3664.855" data-end_ts="3665.055" title="3664.855" id=c_"3664.855">__nah__</span>, this didn't sound right. I'm, I'm gonna go back to my cords one dude. It's like, well, you go ahead and do that. I'm, you know, but now it's kind of like good stuff. Like 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The, the question I have for you is, how much do you think that that actually affects the level of, the level of complexity that people are willing to embrace anymore? Because at this point, if something's hard, I mean, go back to your DX 27. When you first got that thing, there was a bunch of stuff that was just but hard about it. But you didn't have a choice. You didn't have a choice. It was the only damn synth you had. So you had to figure out all the hard stuff. Now it strikes me that, and I hate to sound like get off my lawn, right? But I mean, it does seem like right now, if you buy a thing and it's like, oh, this interface is a little hard, you know, screw it. I'm gonna get something else, or I'm gonna download something else. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>You know, I think as a, a big attribute to decisions that are made today, number one, it's influence from formidable artists or names that you can go, someone can go on a social channel or they can go online or whatever, or in passing. And they're like, oh well, so-and-so's using that. I'm gonna go check it out. You know, dear Sweetwater, dear Guitar Center dear whatever. Right. But the thing that I, that I think that the Game Changer was six, seven years ago is the proliferance of YouTube tutorials. And it comes back to my comment about, if you can't make music today, right, with technology, I mean, it's there. I can't tell you how many times. It's not a lot. But, you know, several times a week I'll, I'll hit a note back to someone who has a question about something and I'm like, Hey, I'm sending you this Ask audio feature they did on External Instrument. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>I think it's one of my, it's one of my favorite ones. Here you go, mark. And then they hit me back and they're like, dude, that was it. That's all I needed to know. And it's like, all it is is a video man. It's, it's great. So it's like, if you can literally type it in, you just type in Velocity, velocity Moog, and there it is. It's like, oh, I see now I can do my mother 32 this way. 'cause there's 17 versions from 17 different guys. Some of them shitty, some of them silly, some of them know only makes, you know, the guy gets on, you can't even understand what they're saying. But it's like, you're gonna figure it out. And I think the advance sort of breadth of, of like, oh, this is too much for me to absorb. I think a lot of folks are realizing now, this maybe was different a couple years ago, even as soon as a couple years ago in 2017. I think a lot of folks demographically too, even down early age, young to veterans, they, they, you know, you can go online, you can even, it's surprising the, the, the amount of people that sign up for courses too. Yeah. 'cause it's all out there. Like stuff I don't even know about it. I'm like, oh really? They have a course now on Isotope? Right. No shit. And it's like, yeah man, I did this, I did the 14 part series on Ozone <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>And I'm a, and I'm, and I, and I'm, I'm not really poking fun of that. I'm, no, I'm just amazed that you can actually go for $20 or whatever, you can go to this site and kind <span style="color:red" data-ts="3845.805" data-end_ts="3845.925" title="3845.805" id=c_"3845.805">__of__</span> learn about synthesis, the differences between A TVF and A DCO or whatever. It's like from whomever. I'm not gonna say names. I mean, there's dozens of them. A lot of these people I know, a lot of people have actually asked me to do stuff for them. And it's like, it's great. I, I really enjoy passing that information. Like sometimes I'll see that email at the corner of my eye of like, here comes <span style="color:red" data-ts="3867.085" data-end_ts="3867.205" title="3867.085" id=c_"3867.085">__a__</span> question <laugh> or whatever, and that's cool. But, or, or a text or something. And you can always tell the way that they're started what it's gonna be. Yeah. Like it's like, if you can see where it says, Hey man, quick question for you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>Then you're like, oh shit, here it comes. But it's like being able to send just a link. Yeah. From whoever. It's, it's, it's awesome. And so I, I didn't have that back in 2003, 2004 when I started with live. I'm a little bit of a late bloomer to live. I have a heavy respect for cats that really <span style="color:red" data-ts="3895.965" data-end_ts="3896.165" title="3895.965" id=c_"3895.965">__jumped__</span> on live at the beginning. I remember meeting Gerhardt at their first trade show. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But I remember him handing me a demo and me just sort of like, okay, I don't really know what's happening with this. Once I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Got it, well it seemed, it seemed improbable because at that time we had Cubase, we had Logic, we had studio, we had all these things. Last thing anyone needed was another DAW. So even though I knew them from, you know, both their work as, as Mono Lake and as well as being Max users, it was sort of like, yeah, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3926.395" data-end_ts="3926.685" title="3926.395" id=c_"3926.395">__rock__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3926.705" data-end_ts="3926.925" title="3926.705" id=c_"3926.705">__on__</span> guys. Good luck with that. And then I got a chance to try it out and it was like, oh shit, this is different. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>Yeah. It took me like, I wanna say four times of really going at it. There was the early sort of <span style="color:red" data-ts="3939.035" data-end_ts="3939.525" title="3939.035" id=c_"3939.035">__whether__</span> there's a version I got from Gerhart, which I rem remember specifically the moment that happened, I think it was that NAMM show 2 9 99 2000 or something, maybe as or something. But then it started floating across my desk in the studio. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>So cracked version, whatever version two, this, that green, yellow, blue. Right. And it got up to about version four. And I remember I would do it sort of like when you asked about how long it took me to transition to software since over hardware. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I would do it sort of after hours, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>I wanna say it was even on a separate computer. And I would, I'd put these stems in or whatever. And I, I remember specifically, I was working on a Matchbox 20 record, and I had all these stems of Rob Thomas and all these outtakes and stuff just sort of inpro tools. And it was really late one night. And I took, I was like, you know what, I'm gonna, let me just call up live. And I called it Live four, and I drug some stems in, and then I just put a beat under it in another clip slot. The light bulb started to go off. But then it wasn't just a session launching and sort of the warping thing. Right. Which even at Live four was a little, it wasn't primitive, but it was still, it was interesting. It was an interesting sort of process to behold. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>Yeah. Yeah. And I, but I remember I changed the tempo, but then it was the global record. Hmm. And I spoke about this over the many years once I started working with live about that light bulb moment. And it was when I realized that I could take multiple clips of different loop areas of that original clip across an entire outlay of clips and be able to arrange them like I wanted in scenes, but record all that on the fly. Right. And then hit that tab key. And once I saw that linear view of what I just did <span style="color:red" data-ts="4036.905" data-end_ts="4037.125" title="4036.905" id=c_"4036.905">__as__</span> sort of <laugh>, I remember giving the demo to Matt, the producer for Matchbox and to Rob and the guys. And I'm like, Hey man, check this out. And they were like, dude, that's awesome. Let's, let's release a remix. Yeah. Yeah. I'm like, yeah, it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="4048.445" data-end_ts="4048.565" title="4048.445" id=c_"4048.445">__this__</span>, this <span style="color:red" data-ts="4048.765" data-end_ts="4048.925" title="4048.765" id=c_"4048.765">__thing__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="4048.925" data-end_ts="4049.165" title="4048.925" id=c_"4048.925">__It's__</span> Ableton stuff, man. It's pretty cool. But at that point it was still sort of like burning the candle for me. It was kind of like, okay, I'll go spend some time <span style="color:red" data-ts="4056.125" data-end_ts="4056.325" title="4056.125" id=c_"4056.125">__with__</span> live. But that's when I sort of dug in. And then right around version five or so, I'm gonna say 2005 or so, that's when basically the way I referred to it is that's when my logic key came out. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> it just came out, sat on the desk and I was just all, I was all in. I was literally all in. It was just Ableton, Ableton, Ableton Pro Tools. And eventually the HD system just started going dark. Right. You know, the audio improved, the mid improved, I started working for the company. That didn't hurt. I started associating more with live users and this whole army of like hardcore longtime users. And then it rolled over into my sound design and I started doing all my sound design work in live with the macros and with ma midi, you know, mapping control and all this kind of stuff. And that was it. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I'm afraid that we have more than burned up the time that I wanted to take from you. And we haven't even really gotten to talk about like, half the stuff that I want to talk about. So I'm gonna, we're gonna plan on doing this again relatively soon because talking about things like sound design, especially now that you're focused on PAC development, talking a little bit more about the process of being a, a clinician, but also how that moved into education and all that stuff. I really want to get into that, but I'd love to, we don't have the time to, so let's plan on doing that again soon. All right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>You got it, man. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You know, before I let you go, one of the things I do want to do is ask you, ask you one thing, which is you have had the opportunity to, to touch, hold and love practically everything out there. Right. What, to you still remains like the holy grail, whether it's hardware, software, it's a, a sample set or an effects plugin or maybe a, a rack mount effects tool? Or what, what is the thing that you, that still to you represents like kind of the epitome of music making tools? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>I would say it's definitely hardware. And I would say this is, it's twofold, but I would say a combination of hardware being my diehard <span style="color:red" data-ts="4190.325" data-end_ts="4190.565" title="4190.325" id=c_"4190.325">__mode__</span> pieces. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> mini <span style="color:red" data-ts="4192.275" data-end_ts="4192.565" title="4192.275" id=c_"4192.275">__mode__</span> and Roland J 800, that type of air that, that, that nineties sort of like, yeah, <span style="color:red" data-ts="4199.045" data-end_ts="4199.165" title="4199.045" id=c_"4199.045">__I__</span>, you know, and, but I gotta be careful because this is that worm, this is that little rabbit hole you can go down when you ask this question. Then it turns into like a 92nd sort of testament to 7,000 pieces of gear. But I sort of look at like the desert island question. If you had to be on a desert island, sure I would want Omnisphere and sure I would want my push. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But on a desert island, technology wise, playing <span style="color:red" data-ts="4224.285" data-end_ts="4224.525" title="4224.285" id=c_"4224.285">__wise__</span> and being satisfied, it's a cross between a mog just for that sheer brute sound of just getting what I want. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, albeit monophonic, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="4236.035" data-end_ts="4236.525" title="4236.035" id=c_"4236.035">__rolling__</span> era of the JD coming outta the MKS era. Right. And a well tuned, well honed fender roads that, I mean, really at the end of the day, I'm the guy that's gonna stay in the room while everyone else goes out for a beer. If I'm sitting in a roads or whirly that's, that's, that's tweaked. It's like, that's all I, that's kind of all I want, man. <laugh>. But that's getting a little personal. But I think technology wise, I can't get enough of my push. I think that's probably evident on my Instagram page, but I just, I absolutely love where we are with current technology, but I also love the fact that we can integrate the older more heritage pieces into that workflow. And so I think, you know, if I had to to walk away with a couple of pieces, it would be a combination of some old rolling and hardware and a and a and Moog. 'cause I could make some music with it. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>You know, I could make some music, I could run a Zoom recorder and I could literally do something that I feel good about Right. To present and to throw up on band camp or whatever and say, you know, man, this was fun. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>This was, yeah. And I was, I was stuck in a desert island, but I had a hell of a time 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>I, I had power. I had, you know, <laugh>, it's like I tell folks these days, like, look, sound design, I can do sound design on a mountaintop in Utah, man, as long as I got wifi to send the stuff away, once I'm done, I'm good. Yeah. Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="4312.805" data-end_ts="4312.925" title="4312.805" id=c_"4312.805">__So__</span> I don't, I don't need a whole lot. Yeah.

Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> question in a way. It's kind of like, but I hope I answered it clearly enough. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. And then the flip side, if, if someone came up to you as they probably do all the time, but if my 16-year-old son comes stumbling up to you, it's like, I'm really getting into this thing and, but I need your advice. How do I, how do I take the next step? How do I get to where I could be a professional in this world? What is the, what is the advice that maybe it wasn't, <span style="color:red" data-ts="4359.045" data-end_ts="4359.325" title="4359.045" id=c_"4359.045">__that__</span> it wouldn't have been appropriate for you at the time when you were coming up, but what would you give advice as advice to people coming up now? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>I would, well I would say immerse yourself with proper gear that's in your wheelhouse. Don't step outside those boundaries. If you really want to make electronic music or you want <span style="color:red" data-ts="4381.765" data-end_ts="4381.885" title="4381.765" id=c_"4381.765">__to__</span> make sense <span style="color:red" data-ts="4382.245" data-end_ts="4382.485" title="4382.245" id=c_"4382.245">__based__</span> music, get yourself a micro <span style="color:red" data-ts="4384.585" data-end_ts="4384.805" title="4384.585" id=c_"4384.585">__bro__</span>. You know, get something that can give you a great sound. Get the job done. If you want to be a producer, get yourself in a scenario where you can interact with individuals and record them, whether it's in a rehearsal space or a shared office park venture where you can, you can set up your gear and you can record bands or vocalists and, and start getting in that world because you can stay in your bedroom forever and you can stay in your headphones forever. But if you really want to, if you really want to get diverse and you really want to get into the role of producing and arranging and having an understanding of how this business works as in regards to songwriting, you gotta get yourself out in it unless you've been put in that environment in another situation. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>So as a 16-year-old, you know, as a college kid or high school kid, or even K through 12 like younger, that's like, I really want to get into this. You know, get yourself a controller. Simple, you know, pad controller, get a program like live and just watch the living shit outta every YouTube tutorial that you can. And if you, if you can. And the other thing is, if you can sit side by side with someone that's already advancing in that particular wheelhouse, again, like producing EDM, music, scoring movies, producing bands, writing your own songs, whatever that is, try to connect with that person on a weekly basis. If you can laptop to laptop and watch what they're doing. That speaks volumes. And I, I recommend that to everyone that's starting out, especially with sequencing and recording. And it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="4480.685" data-end_ts="4480.805" title="4480.685" id=c_"4480.685">__that__</span> you can get with a mentor, someone that you respect, someone that's gonna allow you to sort of hang with them for, for a bit and just sort of take mental notes and then immediately go back to your environment and your studio and don't stop until you get it right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>That's, it's, it's dedication. It's no different than any other task that you're trying to achieve. It's just, it's just, we're in this music business. So it's this loose kind of out there thing. It's like, oh man, making music. That's the, that's the hopefully encouraging advice that I could give someone, especially when they're, they're getting into it. There's a difference between the 45-year-old nine to five lawyer guy who can afford to go buy a ton of gear. And now he suddenly wants to get into, you know, dinking around with beats and putting some stuff on SoundCloud as opposed to that really hungry 16-year-old who's got a little bit of some funds, but he wants to make sure he is making the right choice of what to get started with and not be overwhelmed. It's like, no, you don't need to go buy a whole rack of UAD stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>Right. And all this other really crazy stuff. Start with the basics. Get a micro boot, get a pad controller, get a get live intro, whatever. If you're gonna record bands, you know, get yourself a dog, get yourself a nice PreSonus mic, pre the basics. But YouTube, I'm telling you, it's like, it's, it's unbelievable. We all do it. Like, you get on there and you surf around on YouTube and you, you <span style="color:red" data-ts="4565.225" data-end_ts="4565.425" title="4565.225" id=c_"4565.225">__get__</span>, it really gives you an overarching view of like how much knowledge is out there to learn. You can just, you can just dial it in. It's like proper game stage on recording vocals with a road mic. And literally there will be a title of a YouTube with that exact verbiage. Like, it's right there. It's like, oh, it's like, Hey, my name's Nathan <laugh> and today I'm gonna tell you how to record and today I'm gonna tell you how to set the anter to get that flippy weird effect that's on the T-Pain stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="4593.545" data-end_ts="4593.745" title="4593.545" id=c_"4593.545">__And__</span> you're like, oh, well there you go. Cool. That's all I need. That's all. And sometimes you don't even have to go more than 30 seconds in sort of like learning how to work your GoPro, how to do this on the setting of the GoPro. Oh, there it is. 10 seconds in. That's all I needed. Right. I'm done. Yeah, I'm done. I mean, there's a whole nother demographic coming up, you know, and times, you know, three or four back that are hungry and they're ready to work and they want to learn. And it's exciting and it's, it's hopefully, you know, folks like us can encourage a lot of these individuals to, to make the right steps. <span style="color:red" data-ts="4625.535" data-end_ts="4625.825" title="4625.535" id=c_"4625.535">__Okay__</span>. It's something I enjoy, like hopefully that they can walk away and be like, huh, okay, these are the tools that I need aspo as opposed to overwhelming myself. It's kind of like, like the modular rabbit hole. Yeah. You know, and those, and those websites, you know, trade, trade modular gear.com, you know, hey, modular community, I'm upping my game and I'm getting rid of these 17 pieces willing to trade. It's like, dude, you just just just come out and be honest. Yeah. Right. Yeah. You filled your credit card. You have no idea what you're doing. You're 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>A baseball card collector. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>It's, it's, it's good for us 'cause we can buy it cheap, but just, yeah, maybe go buy a micro <span style="color:red" data-ts="4664.065" data-end_ts="4664.285" title="4664.065" id=c_"4664.065">__bro__</span>. And you, you're good. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright, you, well thank you so much again for your time. I really had a blast talking and, and getting a lot more details about your history. Amazing stuff. Thank you so much. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Huston: </b>Me too, man. I enjoyed it. I'll see you, I'll see you next month 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Actually. Sounds great. I'll see you then. Alright man. Okay. <span style="color:red" data-ts="4680.445" data-end_ts="4680.805" title="4680.445" id=c_"4680.445">__Thanks__</span> you later. Bye. Hey, many thanks to Houston for the great chat. The guy's got such history. I'm really looking forward to kind of having a second pass with him. We can talk in a little more detail about some of his work and his perspectives on how to do presentations and how to do sound design too. So hopefully we'll get on that, soon, sooner, not later. I want to thank everybody for continuing to listen and I will be <span style="color:red" data-ts="4714.285" data-end_ts="4714.525" title="4714.285" id=c_"4714.285">__catch__</span> you next week. See you later. Bye.
