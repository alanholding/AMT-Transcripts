      <i>All right. You don't need to hear from me. Let's go right to the interview with Mark Verbos Here we go. All right. This week we are talking to a person I've known for a long time. I consider him a friend, if nothing else, he's
        the guy that I've always been able to share jokes with when we meet up at, at trade shows or whatever. But he's a phenomenal talent in the, inventing in the modular world. His name's Mark Verbos And he has set the world of buzz with a new set
        of modules for your rec system. We're going to hopefully talk about all that stuff. Hey Mark. How you doing? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark Verbos: </b>I'm doing well.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>I'm great. Thanks a lot for taking the time out to talk to us. I'd like to start off by just having you, kind of explain what you do and give us a little bit of background about how you got there. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>
      Okay, well, as you've already mentioned, right now, I'm going around the world, introducing my new line of your rack modules, but, the Genesis of all this is that, I've been for the last 20 or so years, working as a recording
      engineer and as a musician myself and slowly becoming more and more of a music equipment, engineer or designer. And the way that that happened really was that I, I started out going well, making my own music as a teenager, electronic music,
      particularly. And then I went to school for recording engineering at full sail in Florida. And then, right around the time that I came back, I grew up in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, of course, you know, that, that maybe no one else that era around
      the time that I came back as a, I guess, 19 or 20 year old, I, I met, grant Richter who at the time who's pretty well known to the DIY community and also known for the, the stuff he does now with Malacca.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>
      But he was in the process of creating his own new modular system in the mid nineties when nobody was making new modulars. And because he was from a generation before me and, and a really sort of serious, electrical engineer,
      classically trained, but also a musician. He kind of became a mentor to me in this of thing. And at the time he was the King of repairing the old <span style="color:red" data-ts="184.42" data-end_ts="184.78" title="184.42"
        id=c_"184.42">__Boopa__</span> systems, which there aren't that many of them, but, if somebody had one, generally he was doing the repairs on it. And somewhere along the line through what I learned from him and whatever kind of torch passing
      happened, somewhere along that line, I became, 10 years after that he can the guy who was fixing all the <span style="color:red" data-ts="204.85" data-end_ts="205.03" title="204.85" id=c_"204.85">__boots__</span>, <span style="color:red"
        data-ts="205.06" data-end_ts="205.15" title="205.06" id=c_"205.06">__the__</span> systems, and that launches us forward to today where, I'm trying to take some of what, what, John Luca did back in the day. Some of the things that, that I've
      done with that system to, to, sort of fill in the holes with my own ideas and work with two big things that work with <span style="color:red" data-ts="229.06" data-end_ts="229.36" title="229.06" id=c_"229.06">__Buco__</span> systems, bring all
      these ideas together, as well as some of my fresh ideas and, and bring them into the Eurorack format, which is really exploding right now. Last I heard of something like 80 manufacturers. So it's a, it's a big, it's a big buzz,
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Right? Indeed. Well, it's, that's a really interesting background because, it kind of on one hand, it flies all over the map. And at the other, on the other side of it sort of looks like you had planned this all along, even
        though I'm sure that's not how it feels in real life. So let's, first of all, talk about, your background is both a performer and recording engineer. I know that, way back when I was in Milwaukee, you were really active in the electronic
        music scene. In fact, I think the first time we met, you were advertising the paper looking for analog synths. I had an old MC tool too, that I was trying to move to a new home and, we struck a deal over that. But I remember talking to you
        and, and you were, you were very excited about the electronic music thing and you seem to be sort of like really embracing that. How did you move from electronic music into wanting to do recording engineering? Was it, did it seem natural or
        was it something where you were trying to make a career given what you were interested in? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>
      I think the way that that happened was because as a, as a child, I, I was raised as a musician playing instruments and, and in school taking classes about music and music theory and whatever. And, at some point it became clear to
      me that I'd rather be making my own music than informing someone else's music. And, as I got more into recording, you know, I had bands and, and my own electronic stuff, as I got more into recording it, I wanted to be able to do it all myself.
      So it seemed to me that as a teenager, I don't think I really knew what a producer or an engineer did, but it seemed to me that I had to be one of those or both of those in order to do it all myself. So, I just wanted to, to, to be exposed to
      all of that, to the equipment and to the, techniques for how to record.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>
      And when I got out of school, then I went on to, to work as an intern and then assistant engineer and then engineer in a kind of big time mainstream studio in Chicago. And, ultimately came to the conclusion that maybe that's what I
      wanted to do, but it's a good tool set. And, I've always, well, while I was in school, I learned a little bit about, about, repairing gear and about, you know, reading schematics and that kind of stuff. And I was always interested in that
      stuff. And I always kind of thought that the process of recording music, the process of making electronic music and the processes building electronic instruments is all pretty closely related.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>So how did the work with grant and, the recording studio stuff? How did that mission turn in time? I mean was, because I think, you know, I'm trying to put together the timeframes in my head, and I know that, I would like meet
        you at a, a S in New York and you were heavily involved in the recording studio stuff at that point. But I also remember at some period of time, when you were working with grant, you were also really active in designing your own kind of mini
        systems. You were doing like little sequencers and stuff like that, just kind of for your own use as well. How do those lineup, in terms of time, did you work with grant before or after or during the recording studio period? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>
      All of these things kind of happened on top of each other, but I, I, when I came back from, from school in 95, I guess, I knew that I wanted to build synthesizers. I had a few books and I had a little bit of information and I was
      falling around in the internet, and some of the lists and stuff, but I wasn't, I wasn't equipped to really do it. There <span style="color:red" data-ts="513.79" data-end_ts="513.85" title="513.79" id=c_"513.79">__were__</span> some, there was
      some parts of the process that were still a mystery. And when I met, well, I actually bought this, EMS Putney from, an 80 year old man and it didn't work and I, I attempted to fix it and wasn't successful. And then somebody gave Grant's phone
      number saying, this is a guy who can fix this. So I called him without, without ever having met him, just cold called him.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>
      And he immediately said, no, he said, I don't fix stuff anymore. I learned my lesson on that. And then he couldn't resist. He said, wait, where, where are you getting this stuff? You know, it's just bringing it over. I hate to see
      these things not working. So, you know, when I got to his place and I went into the basement and saw, a museum of electronic music, you know, the blue clothes and, a big surge and 2,600 and EML stuff and putting me in a Synthi and just on and
      on and on, it became clear that this was the guy that, that was, was, was going to expose me to a lot of things that I never would've had the opportunity to get near. And then he pulled out his prototypes of what he was putting together that
      would become what he was calling weird then, but then ultimately came wired.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>
      But, and that was the transition where things like, how do you make a circuit board? Finally there was an answer to that question because he was somebody who was doing it. So it became a thing within, I started to do my own and
      when they didn't work, I could always go to him as a sort of safety net. And in that process, I think you and I were both kind of guiding him in what he was putting together, telling him there's no way that, you know, somebody making techno
      whatever use it that way, or, you know, trying to get him out of, his technique for making music and more toward ours. And, we were all learning at the same time. And, he had, he had a lot more formal training in electronics, obviously since
      that was what he studied.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>
      And he was working at that time. I think he was designing a metal detector per se, but, he, he just enabled me and also my, my friend, good Catanzaro, who was at the time studying in my head. He was going into the labs at, at my,
      the, my Milwaukee Institute of art and design going into the labs and building enclosures. So I would build the electronics and Gabe would build these boxes with folding up plastic to create boxes or metal or whatever. And, and grant would
      always be there to save me when I got in over my head. So it was <span style="color:red" data-ts="707.55" data-end_ts="707.67" title="707.55" id=c_"707.55">__a__</span>, you know, a little bit at a time, but, yeah, during that time, when was
      over there a lot, I was, there was a, a year or so maybe 95, 96 when I was living in Milwaukee and going over to his place all the time to, either bring something to mind that didn't work to be fixed or solder wires on the pots for him or
      whatever. And then I started working in a recording studio in Chicago, and I was up there all the time, back and forth between Milwaukee and Chicago, always learning more from him. And he's, he has a lot more to offer than just being an
      electrical engineer. He's also, rec and tour of, of all things underground and a really sort of quirky, interesting person.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      Right. I think it's, yeah, I think it's interesting because I, I think for as much props as grant has maybe gotten for his work, I still think it's like, there's so much more that people could discover about him. I mean, between
      his love of modular synths and his love of Vespas and his, love of, ridiculous old, obscure music. I always felt like every time I had an opportunity to spend an hour with him, I would learn something amazing. So he was a, he's an incredible
      guy, and I hope that history treats him appropriately for that, you know?
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>
      Yeah. It's a strange thing. How, how the, the, the history of, of electronic music and the history of, of instrument design, is different because of the, the nature of the technology that, it must have been very, very difficult to
      find out about a synthesizer in the seventies when there wasn't really anywhere to advertise them. And then now we have the internet. So in a way everybody's a star, but in another way, nobody's a star. So it's, it's a, you know, it's a smaller
      world than ever, but in some ways it's a bigger world than ever. So he, he still is, a hero to me and really, a trailblazer in, in the idea of, of bringing all of this very forgotten technology back to life for musicians, because, you know, for
      guitar players, the idea of using 50 year old technology is just normal.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>
      I mean, pretty much never got past two bands, right. But for, for electronic music, there, there was for a long time, a lot of momentum into new, new, new, new, and, and, you know, forget about the old and put it in a closet and
      never touch it again. And then somewhere. So I don't know when the official turning point is, but somewhere it became acceptable to, to try out what, in some ways is really obsolete ways of doing things. And it's, it's interesting to see, to
      see, a new generation of, of users, cherry pick, whatever parts of this stuff they want and package it together in new ways. And what's, what's happening with your IRAC is really interesting because there are some manufacturers that are focused
      on I'm doing clones or reissues or old style things. But then there are also brands that are only doing modules based on microprocessors and doing things that weren't possible in the seventies and are kind of a fusion of old and new and, you
      know, creating some, some new middle ground it's an old way of addressing a new idea or something like that.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      Yeah. I agree with that. And in fact, this, this idea of exploring the note, the oldest part of kind of a hybrid music development <span style="color:red" data-ts="968.83" data-end_ts="969.25" title="968.83" id=c_"968.83">__stylist__</span>,
      not just in modular sense, I mean, you see it in a recording. I just had a talk with a student yesterday who is just infatuated with old cassette multi-track decks and their peculiarities and the T bop crew
      is very much embracing of a hybrid of old and new. So it is, it is really an interesting time to watch not only electronic music, but music technology in general make that kind of shift. So, at some point you moved to New York, which must've
      been, growing up in Milwaukee, boy, that must've been a bit of a trip. Did you sort of like bring your music and recording career with you there? Or did you start fresh when you, when you got to New York?
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>
      Actually, I, I spent three years in Berlin Germany between, yeah. I, basically I, I got to that point in the recording studio, working as a staff engineer where I became really frustrated with, with the work that it was doing, I
      kind of felt like, like I was never going to get a great projects because any great project that came to our studio brought their own engineer. And so I was ending up with a lot of the projects that were like the kind that call and, and, and
      ask, how much is your room, you know, per hour. And then when they arrived to the session, they, they say, wait, there, isn't an engineer included. So, you know, get me, so, it's important. I said, I, I can't do this anymore. And I lived in
      Germany and just did my music and, and worked out my synthesizers.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>
      And really at that time, my music, my own music was, was my primary focus. But in 2003, I moved to New York and, whatever stuff I had in my, my dad's basement, equipment wise that I didn't take with me overseas and whatever I had
      in various places in Chicago and whatever, I packed it all up and brought it to New York and then set up shop here and started doing, engineering and producing, doing a lot of the mixes and working with some bands and that kind of thing, in
      addition to doing my music and all the while, doing the, the synthesizer building, but as a hobby, really, building my own stuff, but never actually selling anything. And only, maybe around 2005 started to do some custom, more, can do a lot of
      repairs of Fuqua stuff. And, that, that transition more or less happened because I had such a presence in the, the community on the internet for the, the followers or the, obsessors of the bluegrass stuff.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>
      And, I D I had experienced using it, and I was definitely interested in owning it, but, mostly my experience at that point was, was <span style="color:red" data-ts="1165.23" data-end_ts="1165.33" title="1165.23" id=c_"1165.23">__it__</span>, as
      far as the electronics were concerned was with building, some of the circuits and modifying some of the ideas. And, and I had the experience through grants of seeing a lot of them taken apart and him doing
      repairs for people and, and telling me what he was doing and whatever. And I had all of the documents from him, but really it was around that time also that he decided that he couldn't, he couldn't do the electronics work anymore. At least not
      the hands-on portion of it. He's still doing the design, but he he'd gotten to a point where, his hands weren't feeling very, very great
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      Physically. He was having difficult, too difficulty doing it. Yeah.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>
      So in a way, he, he, at that point, certain to, to pass that work to me because, because he felt like I could handle it and he didn't want to do it, or couldn't do it. So maybe coming more of a, of a technician and not that I ever
      stopped engineering or that ever stopped making my own music, but it becoming a bigger part of my life to do the sentence designing. And since preparing really just happened kind of naturally I didn't one day decide, now I'm going to start
      doing this too. Or instead, you know, it kind of a little bit at a time that can a bigger and bigger part of my life.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      You know, it seemed like your embrace of the Buchla stuff. And the internet sort of coincided in a pretty handy way, because that was the point at which people who had a bookless system sitting in a closet and wanted to resurrect
      it actually had a mechanism where they could kind of look around for people to help out. And you really became the go-to booklet guy, such that not only were you doing repair work, but you were actually developing new modules for booklet
      format. Right. It seems like kind of an intimidating thing to say, you know, Buchla, you know, he's sort of in, in many eyes is sort of a master of this kind of stuff. It seems a little intimidating to say, well, and then I'm going to put
      something in a box to sit right next to it. How much did you sort of like worry about honoring the goals and the techniques of what booklet had been doing with his early systems?
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>
      It's definitely a concern. And the first time that I had a module not belong inside of someone else's system and they had a picture of their cabinet and it was a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1322.43" data-end_ts="1322.68" title="1322.43"
        id=c_"1322.43">__blue__</span> system with one of my modules in the middle. It was definitely a, I guess it's the same kind of thing it's like sending your kid off to college, you know, you're, you're, you're proud, but you're
      also a little bit concerned that maybe, maybe they're not up to task, but, the, the way that it happened really was that I had, a client here in New York who, who has more booklet modules probably than anybody he mentioned to me that, that he
      was looking around for a two 42 programmable Pulser, which in addition to being probably if not the rarest, one of the rarest, Buka 200 modules, which doesn't necessarily make it any better.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>
      It just makes it rarer. But he's, he's a, a musician and he uses his blue play every day to make music that ends up on TV. He he's done themes for TV shows and all sorts of big time work. We got into the conversation about, about
      that module. And I said, it seems crazy to end up spending. I mean, at the time, I, I, I don't know what, what amount of money I expected, but I'm sure it would be very expensive and now much more than then. If you found one to, to, to make it
      yours and good luck even finding one, but then at the end of the day, it's 12 steps long. It's three rows of, of pulse, like programmable pulses. And there's no reset. And it's a very primitive and sort of, not that, not that powerful of a
      module. And I said, wouldn't it actually be more suitable for what you're trying to do.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>
      If, if we just designed the ultimate program <span style="color:red" data-ts="1423.04" data-end_ts="1423.2" title="1423.04" id=c_"1423.04">__will__</span> Pulser had had all the things that you want it to have. So at that point, I
      drew up a sketch about what I thought that might be. And he looked at sketching, made a couple comments, and then he said, yeah, let's do it. And we made the, the agreement that I would make one for him. And one for me, which, which I thought
      was really cool, right. So I made one for him and one for me. And then he put a picture of his, his system somewhere on the internet. And people started calling, contacting him and asking what that was and could they get one? And then the next
      thing we knew, I was making five of them. And then the next, you know, shortly after that, it was 10 and that was the beginning of it.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>
      So, the thing that was important to me was that I try to understand what the, what the philosophical, platform that, that the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1481.11" data-end_ts="1481.42" title="1481.11" id=c_"1481.11">__bucco__</span> 200
      was built on is, and tried, tried to match that, you know, try to stay, stay in with that. And among the things that are important, in the, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1494.29" data-end_ts="1494.64" title="1494.29"
        id=c_"1494.29">__Buccolam__</span> manifesto, are all the signal levels being the same and the, the control, all of the parts that are used on the panel from the same, really longstanding high-end, brands
      like the switches are all C and K and the jacks are, Johnson, banana jacks, and switch craft, audio jacks, and all of that stuff. But also that, that, that, that it, and that it fits obviously in <span style="color:red" data-ts="1524.77"
        data-end_ts="1524.86" title="1524.77" id=c_"1524.77">__the__</span>, in the case of like everything about it, you know, matches with the, with the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1529.39" data-end_ts="1529.78" title="1529.39"
        id=c_"1529.39">__booklet__</span> system.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>
      So, to, to build something that maybe was a hole in the system, like something that doesn't never did not to take an idea that Don had and try to one up him not to compete with him, on, on building, but, you know, trying to show
      what he did wrong and do it better, but, you know, maybe something that, that wasn't there, that that would be nice for a user to have. And so the idea from the beginning, wasn't, wasn't for me to, to, to make modules so that you don't have to
      buy a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1564.1" data-end_ts="1564.27" title="1564.1" id=c_"1564.1">__blue__</span> glove, but also, but to make some, some extra things that could be added to exist in <span style="color:red" data-ts="1570.46"
        data-end_ts="1570.97" title="1570.46" id=c_"1570.46">__glucose__</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Yeah. Well, that's, that's a real interesting point because, when I take a look at the modules that you were kind of responsible for, it did seem to be, if anything, it made the whole system more viable musically. And again,
        but it, but like in a very reverential way, w what do you think Don thought about you doing this? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>
      Well, I talked to Don about it a little bit, and, and he, his attitude was, was, has always been the, he doesn't want to go back. He never wants to repeat anything that he did before. And he wants to always look forward to, to
      doing things that are new and more advanced, but he all in one conversation that I had, where, fairly early on in, when I was doing this, there was a kind of uproar in the users group about, about this stuff. And, and, so I got on the phone
      with him to talk with him about it, and he basically said, there's nothing I can do about it. So I don't want to do anything to you. And there's nothing that I could do, so do whatever you want. But then he turned around and gave me, I don't
      want to say a lecture because it was actually very polite, but he gave, gave me a lot of points or, pointers or, or, or, experienced stories about what it's like to design things to the music industry and ways of protecting myself against
      getting ripped off recommendations for how to deal with things.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>
      And he, and he told me stories about, doing weather research for NASA and all kinds of really interesting things. So I think for him in a way it was, I can't speak for him, but I think that it was kind of, what I was doing was sort
      of silly or like, it wasn't interesting because it was well, part of it was that he said, you only thing that you have to worry about is an ethical problem. And I thought, Oh, no, if you think it's ethical to sell people, obsolete technology,
      which is something that had never even had occurred to me. I mean, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1717.62" data-end_ts="1717.77" title="1717.62" id=c_"1717.62">__it's__</span> the thinking of mine was that it's ethical to sell people,
      anything that they want to buy. Right. So if, you know, if somebody told you that if you didn't know anything about guitars, and then someone told you that the amplifier technology that we all prefer is from the forties, you would think he
      would think that that's crazy.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>
      And that there must be a better way of doing it. And, you know, on paper, there's a better way of doing it transistors or whatever, new digital amplifier techniques or whatever the user is prefer. Something that's from an
      electrical engineers side, incredibly obsolete, right? So the most important thing, and Don didn't say this to me himself, but I read it in, in an interview that he did. He, he said that the kind of paraphrasing, but that the most important
      thing is to design the instrument panel first and then make the electronics, do whatever you need, because then when the electronics go obsolete, the device itself never will.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>All right. That's interesting. That's really great advice. I like how you, you sort of frame that as, Don always wanting to move forward because, I remember it even back, you know, when, when I was hanging around with grant
        and playing around with this Buco system in the basement, I'm like, how could he ever have left this behind? And then you'd look. And it was like, well, you could see he got excited by different technologies that came along. And next thing
        you know, he's doing the, the thunder and the lightning, and he's really into like performance movement and stuff like that. You could see that he had a desire to change what he was working on and the way that he was approaching problems. And
        so he himself sort of has a philosophy that's built around that. A result of all of what you did with the book <span style="color:red" data-ts="1841.94" data-end_ts="1842.09" title="1841.94" id=c_"1841.94">__was__</span> stuff led to this new
        series of your rec modules that you created. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>And my God, did you create a storm with that? I mean, first of all, because, because they're beautiful and they look unlike anything else, secondly, because you announced it and they were like ready to go that day, which is
        like, so the opposite of not only the modular systems, but the music industry in general music industry tends to want to give you nine months to worry about being the first person to get a thing before, you know, and so all the
        pre-announcement and the dates for plan shipments, and then the revised dates for plan shipments, and you just kind of like blew it up, which was really interesting. Cause it happened just before Nam. So you were able to get a lot of
        attention from that, too. How much of your book load design booklet system design experience and background was brought to bear on this and how much did you sort of have to push yourself in terms of making a new, new module design, a new
        circuit design? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>
      Well, there's no question that I'm modifying my, my instinct for how to design something was, was a bit of a chore because the power supplies are different. The voltage ranges are different, the ergonomic situation is different. So
      in a way it's almost like I'm starting from scratch with a lot of the, a lot of the directions that things have to be taken. And among the things are the fact that, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1953.33" data-end_ts="1953.66"
        title="1953.33" id=c_"1953.33">__***<inaudible>***__</span> system, the smallest module is, seven inches high by four and a quarter wide. And in a Eurorack, the smallest something could potentially be as small as one HP, which is, I don't
      know, a third of an inch <span style="color:red" data-ts="1972.43" data-end_ts="1972.85" title="1972.43" id=c_"1972.43">__wide__</span>. So <span style="color:red" data-ts="1975.91" data-end_ts="1976.17" title="1975.91"
        id=c_"1975.91">__when__</span>, what you find is that in a, in a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1977.77" data-end_ts="1978.13" title="1977.77" id=c_"1977.77">__Buka__</span> system, some of the modules are like four of this, six of that.
      Some, a lot of like multiple things where the, the two 81, quad function generator is for attack release envelopes in, in one module.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>
      And the, the low pass gate is for low pass Gates and one module. And the source of uncertainty, two 66 is noise and fluctuating, random voltages, a couple of times, and a few different stored randoms and <span style="color:red"
        data-ts="2010.86" data-end_ts="2011.04" title="2010.86" id=c_"2010.86">__a__</span> integrator and sample and hold all in this one module. And when you get into your rack, you don't really see that, that kind of thinking it's more like each
      of those things is broken up into its own module, right. And part of the, the Buka philosophy, at least by the, the later 200 series stuff was to, to package, the building blocks together in such a way that a musician could get to certain
      techniques just by flipping a switch and, and introducing new thing and have it all doing a lot of the work of getting to that patch already configured behind the scenes so that it isn't like a laboratory experiment to create the patch. And I
      wanted, I wanted to bring a lot of that, kind of thinking in, into what I was doing. So the tendency is for my modules to be a bit bigger physically than most of the uric stuff, right. Because of where I'm coming from.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      Well, they're, they're bigger, but they're also packaged in interesting combinations, which also seems to be something that you drew from the booklet design class, if you saw, you know, if we take a look at like your, what would
      be your VCA, it actually has some tone controls, a little resonant filter built in. It's got, it's got a nice array of, tenure murders all available. And so it's really a package that has sort of like a musical entity to it. It's the final
      piece in a voice, right?
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>
      Yeah. And as far as the, the, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2121.85" data-end_ts="2122.2" title="2121.85" id=c_"2121.85">__tenure__</span> murders or reversing attenuators or whatever, we call them, I try to put them on
      pretty much every CV input, because as a, as a modular user, I find that it's frustrating to not have the ability to, to scale the voltage coming in. I mean, it's, it's, it's, it just seems like the only solution to me. Right. But it doesn't
      really require much more in the electronics it's, you know, it's a pretty simple circuit, so <span style="color:red" data-ts="2156.34" data-end_ts="2156.39" title="2156.34" id=c_"2156.34">__you__</span> might as well throw it in there anywhere
      that it might. And part of, part of the philosophy that also something that I, I am drawing from blue <span style="color:red" data-ts="2166.9" data-end_ts="2167.11" title="2166.9" id=c_"2166.9">__glove__</span> is, is the idea of using
      different size knobs for, for different controls. And trying to, trying to give you the most obvious control for each module is, is on a big knob.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>
      And then everything's kind of built around that physically and try to have kind of a signal flow feel and, and just make it so that, so that again, so that you can get the, the patch without, without thinking of it like a, like a
      scientist, but thinking of it like a musician. And I think that, that's the biggest thing that, that I learned from when Buco was, was to design, to design the front panel. And then after that figure out how to make that circuit, because, the
      other way around doesn't really make sense from a musician's perspective, there are definitely instruments that are, are, are designed were more like on breadboard experiments that turned into something that had a lot of possibilities. So then
      they thought, okay, let's just put jacks for all
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      Of these things.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>
      Yeah, yeah, exactly. And at the risk of actually, you know, sounding <span style="color:red" data-ts="2245.26" data-end_ts="2245.56" title="2245.26" id=c_"2245.26">__critic__</span>, I mean, there, there's more than one way to skin
      a cat, but I think that the, some of the, the search circuit struck me as that, where it feels like that anywhere that may be, it's almost like circuit bending level, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2259.72" data-end_ts="2259.86"
        title="2259.72" id=c_"2259.72">__like__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2260.71" data-end_ts="2261.07" title="2260.71" id=c_"2260.71">__maybe__</span> you could do something with the, with the signal and we might as well put a Jack
      there, you know, and I try to be a bit more deliberate about the way that things work and the, you know, the, the, some of the circuits that, that are in the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2279.04" data-end_ts="2279.31" title="2279.04"
        id=c_"2279.04">__third__</span> system can do 20 different things depending on how their past. Right. But the danger I think, is that people won't really remember or understand how to make those patches. And then that gets in the way of the
      musicality. Sure,
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      Sure. Well, of the, of the modules that you have out currently, I mean, you have, what is in essence, a pretty full voice of, I think it's about the only thing I would say is just not a very clear, like on envelope system, but
      other that you <span style="color:red" data-ts="2315.5" data-end_ts="2315.74" title="2315.5" id=c_"2315.5">__here__</span>, you have like a pretty full false, which of the current modules do you kind of consider, like your baby, your, the, the
      thing that really represents your, your favorite circuit or your favorite design?
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>
      I think that that, that position is, is shared by the voltage multistage and the harmonic oscillator. And the reason that I, in part, it's not a coincidence that those two circuits are, are ones that, that I'd done as Google format
      modules and then adapted into, this, this line, because those are, they're built on old ideas in a way, but they're ultimately like unique, unique ideas <span style="color:red" data-ts="2366.61" data-end_ts="2366.69" title="2366.61"
        id=c_"2366.61">__and__</span> the way that they're, that they're presented unique to my design.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>
      And they're, they're the, the most popular modules. So far in the marketplace, in addition to being the ones that I'm the most invested in. So that's actually a payoff for me, but, the specifically the harmonic oscillator, it was
      there in the sixties. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2394.15" data-end_ts="2394.51" title="2394.15" id=c_"2394.15">__Buco__</span> made, an oscillator that, that had <span style="color:red" data-ts="2397.36" data-end_ts="2397.51"
        title="2397.36" id=c_"2397.36">__that__</span> used, this wave folding technique to create all the harmonics, from, from the crime or in his case, it was from a saw tooth core oscillator and then turned into a triangle and then folded across,
      and I'm using a triangle cord, but that idea existed. But in the time that he did it, first of all, it wasn't possible to get the waves very pure because, there's a lot of matching involved in a lot of, of, of mixing signals together. And they
      have to be scaled properly in order for the, the wave from period to be any good.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>
      So the I've worked on a few of that, one 48 oscillator and, it sounds kind of green wave cabling, but that, but also that module had just, just CVN for the, for the pitch and then outputs for the harmonics. And, and that was it.
      And really what I brought to the table that I think makes it musical and makes it really useful is that all of the, the harmonic outputs are mixed with a voltage controlled mixer with slides here. So you can draw the mix, but also individual
      <span style="color:red" data-ts="2478.44" data-end_ts="2478.93" title="2478.44" id=c_"2478.44">__CD__</span> and for all of all of the harmonics, and then also controls where you can sweep across in various ways and actually plug in some sort
      of external control voltage source and select individual harmonics, or, open up a whole bunch of sweep across them and open them up in, in a way almost like you would open up a low pass filter, right.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>
      And it's been really interesting things happen that are completely fresh. It's additive synthesis, but doing additive synthesis in analog is, is a fresh perspective on, on synthesis. And, and it's, it's interesting because there is
      no, there's nothing to compare it to. So, when I see what I see people use that module for the first time, I usually see them walk up with some skepticism and then there's a kind of Eureka moment where they realize that there are things that
      they can do that had, there's never been a way to do before. And it's so excited and suddenly have a whole bunch of ideas. So that's really the, the reason that you make this stuff is to try to inspire people to do, to make music and to do
      something different than they've been doing over and over.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      Well. Absolutely. And I, I just think it's really exciting to see not only an opportunity to do some additive synth brought to the Euro table, but also, have it, have it be packaged in such a smart, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2587.06"
        data-end_ts="2587.15" title="2587.06" id=c_"2587.06">__you__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2587.15" data-end_ts="2587.21" title="2587.15" id=c_"2587.15">__know__</span>, such a smart way, cause <span style="color:red"
        data-ts="2589.49" data-end_ts="2589.84" title="2589.49" id=c_"2589.49">__edit__</span> synthesis, you know, there there've been people that have tried to do it, but it's very from a very digital standpoint. And I think to
      have this more pure analog, pathway to attack it, but also one that has such a clear and straightforward presentation does really open up some neat options. Well, we're just about, at the end of our time here, but I wish we had more because I'd
      love to talk to you. I mean, one thing I'd like to know is can you give us any hints about what the next things that might be coming from for both electronics might be,
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>
      Well, I have a touch plate keyboard sitting on my work bench right now, but yeah, it is working. It has a couple of bugs that need to be higher now, but that's right around the corner and I'm working on a dedicated envelope
      generator that <span style="color:red" data-ts="2645.02" data-end_ts="2645.35" title="2645.02" id=c_"2645.02">__will__</span> we'll have some, some, some corks I don't really want to do. I don't really want to do, something that's like the rest
      of the pack. So I have a couple of ideas for how to make something that is a little bit special and, you know, a couple of other ideas, but we'll let those come out <span style="color:red" data-ts="2669.66" data-end_ts="2669.92" title="2669.66"
        id=c_"2669.66">__match__</span>. Well, one
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      Of the things that, a couple of what I told a couple of people that I was going to <span style="color:red" data-ts="2675.49" data-end_ts="2675.55" title="2675.49" id=c_"2675.49">__an__</span> interview, a lot of questions were
      about the, the design work of your modules. So first of all, apparently there's quite a Twitter about, about where did you get those incredible knobs? Those are so cool, but everybody talks a lot about the, the graphic design and the physical
      design of the module face plate. Did you do the graphic design or did you work with someone else on that?
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>
      I did all the design of the modules themselves. I have a designer who did the logo, which doesn't appear on the, on the modules, but is on the website and on all the letterhead and media and stuff. So, no, I was, I was a little
      bit, reluctant to let go of the reigns of the panel design because I thought that was such an integral part of the, of the designing of the module. Right. So, so if people like it, then that makes me extra happy. Yeah.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      People, people are blown away by it. It's, that it really brought a level of, a lot of people talk about bringing a new level of graphic design to the module thing. So instead of everything looking sort of like grunge, meth
      addict, you know, graphic design, this stuff is so classy and so beautiful. So congrats on that, that has caused quite a stir as well. So before we leave, there's a couple of things I want, I want to raise. First of all, you talk about this
      kind of a string throughout your entire careers. And really, since you were a teen has been doing your own music, are you still doing music?
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>
      I am. And actually it's been a kind of, interesting thing too. I think you said before that I was doing performances and had been doing that all along. But, since I launched this product line, I've done, a few performances using my
      synthesizer as the main instrument. And it's been kind of a, rebooting of my, my, my operation as a musician to now kind of combine these forces together and in an additional new way. And, it's been pretty cool. I, I just came back on Sunday. I
      came back from Germany and I was at the music Mesa trade show in Frankfurt. And then I was in Berlin for a week, with doing some in-store and some demos for the, people Promax four and national there's Loudon. And I did a performance at the
      arena club in Berlin using this, and some, so <span style="color:red" data-ts="2854.15" data-end_ts="2854.51" title="2854.15" id=c_"2854.15">__yep__</span>. Still doing it
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      Well. That's cool. Do you, have you had any re releases lately that you can share?
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>
      I haven't done any in the last two years. I haven't done any releases of my own. Yeah. I've done lots of that kind of stuff. And, and produced bands. And there's a band, a band called Minx that I produced this year or last year, I
      guess. And, ultimately it's kind of a one man band. So I even after the, the album was finished, I played keyboards in the band and went to Japan with <span style="color:red" data-ts="2893.98" data-end_ts="2894.1" title="2893.98"
        id=c_"2893.98">__them__</span> as a member of the band.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      Well, that's great. And then one last thing, you are a self-made electronics guy to the point that you're doing this, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2909.23" data-end_ts="2909.37" title="2909.23" id=c_"2909.23">__make__</span>
      this amazing work and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2910.53" data-end_ts="2910.73" title="2910.53" id=c_"2910.53">__mouse__</span>. Some of that it comes from, you know, spending 20 years dedicating herself. And some of it comes from
      spending time in the basement with <span style="color:red" data-ts="2919" data-end_ts="2919.33" title="2919" id=c_"2919">__grant__</span> Richter. Not everybody has those opportunities. If someone wanted to get into a synth design or module
      design or just musical electronics, what would you say kind of in the world of now would be a way to approach that?
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mark: </b>
      It seems to me that now is a better time to learn, learn this stuff than ever before. Thing is that if, if you would go to school for electrical engineering today, you wouldn't learn about any of this stuff. You'd learn more about
      programming. So in a way, this is, this is the music electronics, or specifically analog synthesizers are interest. It wouldn't actually even be something you could go to school for anymore, but with all of the kids and the community sort of
      crowdsourced, projects that are out there now, it's a much, a much safer world than it was 20 years ago when this was kind of a deeply guarded black art, where if you didn't meet somebody like grant, then you would never actually get the
      information. We now it's all over the internet and there are even new books about it. The books that I had when I was starting out were 20 years old at that point, but now <span style="color:red" data-ts="3007.09" data-end_ts="3007.29"
        title="3007.09" id=c_"3007.09">__this__</span> know current information, there, there are people with blogs or with websites that are very supportive and, and really kind of give it all away. So it's, it's really a good time to be, to be, an
      enthusiast, I think.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      All right. Well, thank you so much your time. Again, I have probably two hours more stuff I'd love to quiz you on. Thanks again for taking the time and congratulations on, not only, getting the Verbos electronics modules out, but
      congratulations on the tremendous amount of attention that you're getting for that. I hope I hope those translate into, a long history for your company.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thanks a lot. And we'll talk again soon.
