<b>Darwin: </b>All right. This week I have a very special guest, somebody who's gear I've used over the years. Someone who I run into, on a fairly regular basis at trade shows, but someone who, has kind of developed a, an aura around his name and personality. I'm going to be talking to Mr. Suit, suit and tie guy. Welcome to the podcast. How are you doing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>I'm fine. Darwin 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thank you so much for taking, taking some time this evening to, to chat. I've got about a million questions to ask you, so, I am kind of raring to go, but, first of all, I, I'm wondering if you could just give a really quick overview on your moniker. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>Well, first of all, I wanted to, yeah, thank you for the very kind introduction and, basically, my name is Suit and TGA because I was told that my name was Suit and TGA 20 years ago, and I just, lived with it. So that's my name. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. It's a, <span style="color:red" data-ts="78.515" data-end_ts="78.635" title="78.515" id=c_"78.515">__i__</span>, it's, it's a really distinctive thing, and you've done some neat stuff with iconography and with, with sort of like the typeface you use, and it's really become a kind of a thing. And, and quite frankly, when I see you at trade shows, you're always wearing a suit and tie, so you're like immediately identifiable. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>I am a, a walking advertisement for myself, <laugh>. So, well, that's, and, <span style="color:red" data-ts="102.075" data-end_ts="102.195" title="102.075" id=c_"102.075">__and__</span>, and it's always been that way. That's why, that's why they, that's why those, those people named me that when they did. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. There you go. So you were, you were actually a suit and tie wearing guy before you got the name. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>Yeah. For some reason, I just, that's like, I don't wear a tie every day, but anytime people are gonna, when I go out in public, I like to, that's cool. You know? And, but yeah, I always performed music under that name, back, like in the nineties when I was working in, in publishing. And then, from publishing and pre-press, I moved into, I, I worked at a television station, in the, in the audio department of, a TV station. So I was the, I mixed audio during the newscasts and had to also do some, screen graphics and whatnot. Those who know me know that, like, one of my, one of my interests is, news dissection and, criticism and alt media and whatnot. And one of the reasons why these things fascinate me is because I, before I built synthesizers, the only thing that, the most interesting thing that paid me money was mastering records. And then before that, the most interesting thing that paid me money was working in, in TV news. And then also I also worked, at a newspaper, as well. So I saw, I saw news from both the print and the broadcast, and I recog, I, I wish everybody could have that experience because I think that they would be, they would be much more, skeptical and actually like, adversarial and belligerent about the media that they consume <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, so <span style="color:red" data-ts="205.905" data-end_ts="206.125" title="205.905" id=c_"205.905">__you__</span>, you actually really got to see sort of like the making of the news from the back door. And I can imagine that, that, that makes you pretty skeptical. What, what were the kinds of things that you saw that irked you the most? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>I was bothered, by the way, well, on the newspaper side of it, the print end, I was bothered by the way that wire stories were wire stories displayed. Their slant by the way the information was loaded into them. The, the author of a wire story from like AP or Reuters or Knight Ritter or whatever, will load the information that they want people to see at the front of the story, because they know that the story's gonna be cut from the back. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>So, so, and then, like, I, I was a paginate. I laid out the paper, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I, I laid out the paper and I also wrote captions for photos. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I wrote headlines and I <span style="color:red" data-ts="263.645" data-end_ts="263.845" title="263.645" id=c_"263.645">__wrote__</span>, wrote or edited headlines or whatever. And so I was <span style="color:red" data-ts="267.565" data-end_ts="267.685" title="267.565" id=c_"267.565">__at__</span>, I actually was considered editorial staff. I mean, it's not, it's not, it's not a graphics job when you're doing that. You have to, you have to have an exercise judgment, right. And then run it by the editor. Sure. And I, I was bothered by, you know, sometimes I would go through stories with the editor and be like, look, I don't like the way this is, I don't like the way this story's loaded. Let's move this paragraph to here, and this paragraph to here and whatnot. I was able to correct some of the things that I saw coming through. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>Also, I don't like the, I don't like the terms red state or blue state, and I worked really hard to get that language out of any, headlines. Sure. That I authored while I was there. So I'm proud of that. That's cool. Yeah. And the, the news, like the TV news, broadcast news is, is more interesting from like a critical point of view, because newspaper people generally are fairly competent, at least the ones that I worked with, even at the small town newspaper is the peak in Daily Times. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, which isn't an AP award-winning newspaper, believe it or not. And, they, they really, you know, they really had their, their act together, but it was working in, in TV that I saw that like, yeah, these people, these, these people that read the news, they, they can't even spell. Okay. <span style="color:red" data-ts="342.345" data-end_ts="342.565" title="342.345" id=c_"342.345">__Mm__</span>. Like I was, I was offended by their, their, lack of <span style="color:red" data-ts="348.885" data-end_ts="349.005" title="348.885" id=c_"348.885">__a__</span> ability to use the English language when they had to, to write things themselves. And yeah. So I mean, that was, that's where it starts, you know, it's interesting, but like interesting, but like, the whole thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. It's interesting you say that because if, when you think about it, there's no such thing as a face in newspaper land, right? Or not much of <span style="color:red" data-ts="368.085" data-end_ts="368.325" title="368.085" id=c_"368.085">__much__</span>. No, not much of one. So, so you don't get the job because you look right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>No, you do not. But, looks are pretty important on tv. So, you know, obviously there are a lot, a lot of pretty faces, but I could go on about this all day. But <laugh>, we're, we need to talk about <span style="color:red" data-ts="383.725" data-end_ts="383.805" title="383.725" id=c_"383.725">__some__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I, I know, I know. I just, I, I just really get fascinated because one of the things that always blows me away is the backgrounds that people bring to, to the work that they do in the art that they do. So let's jump ahead and then, and then we may come back and visit, revisit some of this. 'cause I <span style="color:red" data-ts="399.245" data-end_ts="399.325" title="399.245" id=c_"399.245">__mean__</span>, I'm curious, but 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>Before we go on, I'll leave you with one thing. Okay. And this should be with the rest of the information in the podcast. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> is that if you're ever suspicious <span style="color:red" data-ts="409.635" data-end_ts="409.925" title="409.635" id=c_"409.635">__that__</span> the news media is intentionally lying to you back up because it's, they're not competent enough for that. Okay. <laugh>, they're lazy. They rely on their government sources. Right? They don't want to do any real work. So they listen to whatever their friends from like, you know, ex Pentagon or <span style="color:red" data-ts="428.245" data-end_ts="428.445" title="428.245" id=c_"428.245">__their__</span>, their friend from, oh yeah, I got John here from the Council on Foreign Relations. He's gonna tell us all about this. Oh, yeah. So you're basically a mouthpiece for these people, right? They're like, news media is not intentionally manipulating you. They are just lazy. That's it. Okay. They're just lazy. That's why I think alt media is more important nowadays. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I wanna talk a little bit about your current, your current work, which is, running the organization called STG Sound Labs, where you make a bunch of really interesting modules. Thank you. Now, you first came on my radar because you had a really interesting wave folder, and I've always been a little obsessed with, different kinds of waveform manipulators. But when I started looking into it and I started talking to other people, what most people really got obsessed about were two different systems. One is the Mankato filter, and the other is what I can only call a deconstructed sequencer, which is your combination of modules that become a sequencer. Right. And I would like <span style="color:red" data-ts="502.885" data-end_ts="503.005" title="502.885" id=c_"502.885">__a__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>Modular sequencing network. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Modular sequencing network. Sure. That's what we'll call it. I'd like to talk about those two things in specific, because they really capture people's imagination in an interesting way. Let's talk about the filter first. Cool. First of all, where's the Man Cato filter come from? And, in your case, you have a very specific layout, at least in the five U version. I don't know what the Euro version looks like, but the five U version has like this circular entity to it that's just really unique. It kind of like deals or, or looks like, at least, like it deals with the phase, phase relationships of different outputs of a filter. Can you talk a little bit about what the Mankato is and where it came from? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>Yeah, I'd love to. The Mankato filter was originally designed by Thomas Henry of, and he lives in Mankato, Minnesota, which is why it's called the Mankato Filter. And what Thomas Henry did was he took, if you're familiar with the con, the design or theory of a voltage controlled lowpass filter, say like the bob, the classic Bob Mogue four pole low <span style="color:red" data-ts="570.765" data-end_ts="570.965" title="570.765" id=c_"570.765">__pass__</span> filter. It is four RC networks in series Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, where the resistors are replaced with voltage control gain element. In Bob's case, they were transistor pairs. And what Thomas Henry did, it is so genius, is that he replaced those transistor pairs with logarithmic gain cells of a, of a quad VCH ship. Okay. Okay. It was made by, analog devices called the SSM 2164. Right. So there's four, and this was a, this was a VCA designed for audio applications. So they're, they're logarithmic, VCAs, they're not linear, so, okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>So they have an exponential response to, to control current. The reason that this is so, is so clever is that one of the hard things in any voltage controlled circuit that has a pitched element is that pitch has an exponential relationship to frequency. Electronics are linear, okay. But our ears are exponential. Right. That's one way to look at it. There's like, depending on how you want to stand, you could put it any way you want, but things like amplitude, you know, perceived amplitude, perceived pitch or whatnot, these things are all exponential in nature. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, our ears are exponential. Right. So, one of the tricky things with any pitched device that is analog in nature is that at some point you have to convert a linear control signal to an exponential current to either charge an oscillator or to control the, the FC of a filter. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>Okay. Okay. So what Thomas Henry did that is so brilliant by using this, is that he integrated this exponential converter into the filter ladder itself, because these gain cells have a logarithmic response. Right. And they're all, they're all close together. The thing is extremely stable, has an extremely stable control response. Okay. Very and very consistent across the spectrum. That's what's special about the Mankato. Now then, Tim Parkhurst took this four pole filter, and then he, he's like, Hey, wouldn't it be neat if we also had like four more outputs, <laugh> We'll just invert all the outputs. Okay. Okay. And then you've got, you have the, you have the positive and negative of all four filter poles. Right. Okay. And then you can add, you can add them to make different shapes. You could use them in quadrature, applications. Right. Okay. Right. And so you have this, this nice pallet of different, tams and phases of the resultant, resonance. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So when you, when you said it was like a four, a four channel VCM, like, so how do you get eight outputs? But I see you just, you just invert the invert the result. Yes. And now you have really sort of like a pallet of quadrature related outputs to play with. You could do some interesting design with that. Al bet. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>I laid out that panel in 2006 or 2007, Uhhuh <affirmative>, and, which I guess it's 10 years ago now, because I was, I, Tim Parkhurst and John Mahoney at the time had a website called Magic Smoke Electronics, and they sold, they were selling these boards, and they also sold like Thomas Henry books and whatnot. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, they were kinda like a, a retail outlet for Thomas Henry related things. Oh, sure. Okay. John said, Hey, you know, it would be neat to have a layout for the, for the Mankato. So I did the Moog format layout, and I, I laid it. I, I'm not real fond of the circle in electronics. I think that I, I think that it's, I don't think that it's relevant to the design of a sequencer. 'cause everyone, like, there's a lot of people that like, oh, it would be really neat if I put all these knobs in a circle. I know. And I think that's, I don't think that's, I think that's dumb. That's not the way, that's not the way things work. You know, I don't look at a piece of music, of sheet music and everything's written <span style="color:red" data-ts="821.765" data-end_ts="821.965" title="821.765" id=c_"821.765">__in__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="821.965" data-end_ts="822.085" title="821.965" id=c_"821.965">__inside__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="822.085" data-end_ts="822.285" title="822.085" id=c_"822.085">__and__</span> one 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="822.505" data-end_ts="822.725" title="822.505" id=c_"822.505">__And__</span> one e 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>Alternator <span style="color:red" data-ts="823.365" data-end_ts="823.485" title="823.365" id=c_"823.365">__around__</span>. It goes from one side to the other. There's a reason it goes from one side to the other. We think about musical lines as they're musical lines, not musical circles. Right. So, but in this scenario, it's actually extremely appropriate, right. To put these things in a circle so that you can understand their phase relationship, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="844.005" data-end_ts="844.205" title="844.005" id=c_"844.005">__The__</span> phase relationship. Right. Yeah, absolutely. It's pretty brilliant. Well, the other thing that's cool about it, thank you. And again, kind of in an iconography sort of way, you can see one of those things from like across a stadium <laugh>. Right. And it really jumps out. Yes. And so it's, you know, there's, there's a value in that too. You know, I always think back to recording equipment. Back in my days in the recording studio, you could always see a focus <span style="color:red" data-ts="870.255" data-end_ts="870.605" title="870.255" id=c_"870.255">__Right__</span>. Mic pre from like, across the studio, because it was the only thing that had red panel. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>Or a even tight H 3000 is like that too, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yep. Yeah. And so these things kind of jumped off the rack and it, and it ended up being, you know, they were good pieces of gear, but it also helped that they were really unique looking. And so, so you'd be able to tell, you'd be able to see one coming. Right. Now let's talk about the se sequencing system, because this is fascinating to me. I, I had never, before I saw you do this, I'd never really imagined deconstructing the concept of a sequencer this far. But it's, it's seems pretty brilliant. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>Thanks. I can, it starts from a couple of places. The first and most important is that in 2001, I was having a phone conversation with a friend of mine that I had been friends with since 1997. And we played music together and we were looking for, it was improvisational music, and we wanted sequencing that we could interact with. We were looking at, we started to look at hardware. He called me up one night and he said, Hey, is there any way to control the length of one analog sequencer from another analog sequencer? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I said, no, there isn't. 'cause at that point, there was not. Right. I'm not even sure if there is now. So he said, well, then I'm gonna write my own sequencer then. And, this man's name is Jim Coker. And, oh 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>My 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>Goodness, over the next three years, we developed numerology where like numerology is a modular sequencing environment and audio unit host for the Macintosh. And everything that I wanted to see in a sequencer was implemented into numerology. And for three or four years, I played every electronic show that I played. I used the freshest alpha <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>The freshest to build of numerology yet, and it never failed me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You were the never, you were the torture tester 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>Even. Yes. Yeah. And like, and, Jim is, an extremely talented programmer, and, systems architect. And, he is one of my best friends, and I am very proud to, have been involved in numerology to have like, birthed it with him. And, he's doing a great job with it. I don't use it anymore because I don't use a computer for composing anymore. Really. I use hardware for composing. So, but, it just came a point with, me and numerology where I had to do something else because I, it was really just enough for, there's only room for one person on that boat, that's, that's pulling the, pulling the numerology barge. And, I needed to do my own thing, so. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>So now, now that, you know, I was involved in numerology, you can see why I have a modular hardware sequencing environment, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. I do. And, and why it looks the way it does. Right, exactly. I didn't, I had no idea. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1052.505" data-end_ts="1052.725" title="1052.505" id=c_"1052.505">__See__</span>, I've been a numerology fan from the Get-go. I've loved that thing. And, it, what you have sort of looks like, it looks like a physical manifestation of it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>Yeah. That the, I, that's the, that's the idea is that like, that's where, you know, like using numerology allowed me to separate the concepts of Pitch and time. Right. And Timur Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and deal with them independently, and gave me a long, a long period to work with those ideas and develop them naturally. I work with analog sequencers like this. And one of the things that I find extremely disappointing about electronic musicians in general, and especially in the boutique modular community, because they should know better <laugh>, no people are gonna think I'm being really critical here, but I don't have a choice, is that people think too much. They can think about patching up a sound, but patching up the sequence that makes the sound, they don't have as much imagination with. They tend to think of everything that they've learned about signals and controls and and whatnot. It goes out the window as soon as they start thinking about notes, like Right. People who should know better asking like, why isn't there a rest on that voltage sequencer? <laugh>, well, define a rest. What are you talking about? Right. You can't have a rest on a voltage sequencer, <laugh>. It's always putting a voltage out. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's always sending a voltage. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>And a trigger sequencer, it is either putting a trigger out or it is not putting a trigger out. There's only two states. The way that I use my sequencers most of the time is I actually use the trigger sequencer to drive the voltage sequencer and fire the envelope generators off. Okay. Because I can interact, it allows me to easier interact with the notes that are going on <span style="color:red" data-ts="1164.545" data-end_ts="1164.765" title="1164.545" id=c_"1164.545">__in__</span>, in a more dynamic fashion than when you're just looking at, notes on a grid. Basically, when you're thinking about notes on a grid, you have to, you have to break free of that, and you have to start thinking about pitch patterns and rhythm patterns and how they can interact and where you want them to restart and whatnot. And you get more interesting results that way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that's actually <span style="color:red" data-ts="1187.885" data-end_ts="1188.005" title="1187.885" id=c_"1187.885">__a__</span> really interesting point, because if you think about it, that, that ends up almost being rag alike or something where, where you're, you're involved in the development of a phrase rather than the development of a series of notes, right? <span style="color:red" data-ts="1202.435" data-end_ts="1202.925" title="1202.435" id=c_"1202.435">__Correct__</span>. And so doing that kind of thing gives you <span style="color:red" data-ts="1205.505" data-end_ts="1205.725" title="1205.505" id=c_"1205.505">__be__</span>, if you're driving the pitch sequence from a trigger sequence, now all of a sudden this idea of it's always sending a voltage is tightly integrated to the phrase, the rhythmic phrase that you create. And the whole thing kind of unifies in a really cool way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>Yeah. And it, it also, when you start thinking about pitch and time and timur independently, it changes the way you look at a lot of other things in, in music. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I, I can't really describe it. Sometimes you want things to happen exactly when you want them to happen. Right. And sometimes you want to think about having a series of things happen and then deciding later on when you want them to happen. Okay. I, I, I can't describe it. But another, another person that like has very successfully, like separated these concepts is my friend Corey Flanagan. He's a drummer, and he plays synthesizers and drums at the same time using, he uses, alternate mode cat controllers, like the trap cat and the drum cat, and he uses them with synthesizers. But all the drums that you hear are acoustic. He, he plays the acoustic drums along with, he has some sequenced elements, but, he works a lot with, the cat stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>You can set up a, a chain of notes on a pad, uhhuh <affirmative>, so you can have a pattern of notes and then like, hit the pad to step through the notes. Oh. It's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1294.645" data-end_ts="1294.725" title="1294.645" id=c_"1294.645">__like__</span>, or stored in the pad. Okay. Sure. Right. And then there's a pad to reset things. And he has developed over the past five years, a musical voice entirely based on this concept. And he, he'll have like, multiple chains set up on different pads and then play a pattern on those pads to generate his melodies. Oh. Like, it's very, very, like he's, he's working with concepts that, like, this is, this is ridiculous stuff. And I, I keep on, trying to get him to do some YouTube videos where he plays one of his songs and then goes over all the techniques he used to make the song. Right. Because like, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1334.965" data-end_ts="1335.085" title="1334.965" id=c_"1334.965">__the__</span>, I, I understand not wanting to, he's worked really hard to develop these techniques, and I think that they are special. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>Okay. They are very special. Right. But he's been doing this for five years. There's no one that's gonna like, I mean, you, you could have to, you gotta run really fast to catch up with that guy. <laugh>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1352.195" data-end_ts="1352.485" title="1352.195" id=c_"1352.195">__like__</span>, I don't know. I don't know how to put it to you, man, but like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1355.385" data-end_ts="1355.605" title="1355.385" id=c_"1355.385">__he__</span>, I, it's, I told him, I said, like, don't, yeah. So the other, the other thing that, was kind of in, you know, that inspired me to think about hardware sequencing as a network instead of a, you know, like a monolithic fashion. I call them monolithic sequencers. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, those big sequencers that are integrated <span style="color:red" data-ts="1375.265" data-end_ts="1375.485" title="1375.265" id=c_"1375.265">__and__</span> supposed to do everything, like anything that has a voltage row where there's like a trigger control and voltage Right. On every stage or something like that. One of the things that made me want to go in a more modular fashion was I saw a guy named Dave Bradley, who he lives in Iowa. He and Larry Hendry are the two guys that made the MOTM format viable by doing all of the infrastructure work and panels for DIY modules that Paul couldn't do. Paul could barely supply people with his own modules. Right. Because there was so much demand for them. Right. But everyone was loading them into cabinets that had rails that Larry Henry made. Larry, Larry died a few years ago <span style="color:red" data-ts="1421.905" data-end_ts="1422.125" title="1421.905" id=c_"1421.905">__on__</span>, I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Think. Wait, he's the guy that came up with this stooge thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>Right. The stooge bracket is called the STO bracket because Yeah. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="1430.685" data-end_ts="1430.845" title="1430.685" id=c_"1430.685">__the__</span>, like they, there was, Larry and Dave, and there was another guy, I can't remember who was the third sto, but like, they just called themselves the three Stooges. Stooges. Okay. And, and so Dave, he, his website is hot rod <span style="color:red" data-ts="1447.625" data-end_ts="1447.845" title="1447.625" id=c_"1447.625">__mo__</span> tm.com, I think. And he had this concept on his site of a modular sequencer that was even more deconstructed than mine, as in like his voltage controller idea. It couldn't even step on its own. His idea was to have a stepped voltage generator that would address the, a voltage controlled stage selector on the, on the voltage sequencer. Right. Okay. Sure. Which is a little bit beyond, that's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1479.005" data-end_ts="1479.045" title="1479.005" id=c_"1479.005">__not__</span> over the top really what I want to, right. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. But, but his idea was that it should, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1484.205" data-end_ts="1484.445" title="1484.205" id=c_"1484.205">__that__</span> was that the sequencer should be as modular as the synthesizer was. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>Sure. So I, I just wanted to lake also, you know, give a shout out to him too. He probably won't ever hear this, but <laugh>, you know, he might, he's a, he's a great guy. He's also a fellow Hammond player. So the, like, I think the most important aspect of our sequencing network is that to drive everything, we use what most people call D nsync, which is the, the sync between say a Roland 8 0 8 and, a 3 0 3. Okay. We took Dsy, which is more appropriately, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1517.365" data-end_ts="1517.485" title="1517.365" id=c_"1517.365">__a__</span> more appropriately called Sync 24, and turn it into a little connector, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1522.685" data-end_ts="1522.805" title="1522.685" id=c_"1522.685">__a__</span> little three pin connector, and we have a din <span style="color:red" data-ts="1525.405" data-end_ts="1525.685" title="1525.405" id=c_"1525.405">__sync__</span> inlet into the system, and there's a distribution card. And this distributes sync to everything that is tempo driven that I make. Okay. And we have the voltage sequencer, we have a trigger sequencer, we have a clock divider called the time divider, which gives you, listens to the Sync 24 stream and gives you musically useful clock divisions. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you can change it from trigger mode to gate mode, and you can rhythmically invert those divisions if you want. Okay. Our voltage controlled switch has, which is not out yet, but should be this year. The, the voltage controlled switch, has this bonus feature, which is that it also hooks into the sync bus. And the four inputs to the voltage controlled switch are normalized to A CPU listening to the Sync 24 bus. And it is spitting out clocks at eighth notes, 16th notes, 16th triplets, and 32nd notes. So you can do tangerine dream style ratcheting with this thing. Right. Yeah. By the way, I, I coined that word. So everyone using the term ratchet to describe that owes me a royalty <laugh>, <laugh>. But like, so the first, you know, and that's, that's why gate divide on numerology exists is that was, I was our way of implementing that idea. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>Sure. In numerology and gait divided numerology, it can go up into the audio rate actually, because everything in numerology is audio rate, but no, in, all you really need to sound, you know, if you want to do the tangerine dream style ratchet rhythms, you need to have those four value. You need to have a eighth 16th, 16th triplets, and 32nd notes. You know, so you take an eighth note voltage sequence and you pump it into the voltage select input on my switch module, as long as it's hooked into the sync bus, and it'll spit out, it'll spit out that stream of, of notes. And then if there's, if your voltage is all the way down, then there's, there's no rhythm spit out. If your voltage is five volts, then it's 32nd notes. If your voltage is four volts, it's well between four and five volts, 32nd notes between three and four volts, it's 16th triplets. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>If it's between two and three volts, it's 16th nodes. And if it's between one and two volts, it's it's eighth nodes. Now also, we have these envelope generators that we're working on that should also be out this year that connect to the sync bus. And this is, so you can have vols, you can have tempo synchronized envelope stages. So if you want Awesome. The decay <span style="color:red" data-ts="1682.635" data-end_ts="1682.925" title="1682.635" id=c_"1682.635">__Yeah__</span>. Right. To be exactly one, one eighth note. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> you can do it with, with this stuff, you know, so it's not just the sequencing network that benefits from, from the sync bus. Right. And eventually we'll have other sequencers as well. Ire, I'm, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1699.925" data-end_ts="1700.125" title="1699.925" id=c_"1699.925">__it__</span>, I'm itching. I'm itching like mad to discontinue that trigger sequencer. I hate building it 'cause of all the switches that are on it. Oh, sure. It's such a pain in the ass. Right. You know, I want to do something else. I don't want to go into detail about what I'm gonna do. Yeah. There's, there's other, I'd like to, I'd actually like to, to do a module that'll, interface with the, the Archangel Sink bus too, because we have this, add-on for the archangel called the Huffer. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I wanted to ask you about the, the archangel, because I'm not clear on what interaction you have with that thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>Okay. Basically, the design process for the Archangel was very, very similar to the design process for all the STG <span style="color:red" data-ts="1744.045" data-end_ts="1744.205" title="1744.045" id=c_"1744.045">__Sound__</span> Lab stuff. Okay. Which is that I work with an engineer, his name is Joe G Risso. He is one of the smartest people I've ever met in my life. Like, we needed to develop a product for him to sell. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>I, I was like, you know, here, here's my, here, you know, like we need A-A-A-T-K-B for the rest of us. Right. And that was, that's basically the, the, the design process of the archangel is A TKB for the rest of US <laugh> or A TKB for the 21st century. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Good choice. That's a cool perspective. Now, I'm, I took a quick look here at, analog Haven and I see that you have pretty much equivalent of this whole deconstructed sequencing system in both Euro and five U. Are these like identical boards just behind different faces, or do you have to redesign them to work? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>Yeah, the, well we do a lot of, we leverage the hell out of this shit, man. Okay. We leverage the hell out of it. So there is one main board that drives all four sequencers in Moog and Eurorack format. Okay. And, and it's important to say Moog format instead of five U, because five U does not necessarily mean Moog format. Right. Sure. I'm, I'm done building an MOTM format. Okay. So, if someone else, you know, wants to, I, I just, I, I had to focus, I had to roll back, in like 2009 or so and say like, I'm gonna focus on Euro rack and Moog format and that's it. Okay. Alright. So I don't build in frack rack anymore either. Got it. But, yeah, so there's one main board that drives, the sequencers in both formats. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>Okay. If you see, there's also, we also have a, a board, that has, it's got a CPU and some buffers on it. And depending on what software you load in it, it's the time divider or it's a regular old <span style="color:red" data-ts="1873.945" data-end_ts="1874.265" title="1873.945" id=c_"1873.945">__pulse__</span> like clock divider. It depends on like how the board is used. Right. You know, so like, sure. The board actually has footprints for jacks on it, and if you load Jaxon it, it's a little four hp, divider module for your rack. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But, there's also a header on it, or you know, a footprint for a header on it. And so you can, clamp it to the, to a front panel and it can be something else. Right, right. The, the.com, which is a comparator and sub <span style="color:red" data-ts="1907.185" data-end_ts="1907.465" title="1907.185" id=c_"1907.185">__active__</span> generator. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> in your rack format is also the pulse matrix in MOG format. That's the same, it's the same board on the inside, but in the pulse matrix has like a, has a front panel PCB and it, it gets a, attenuator for the, the threshold input. Okay. So, so yeah, there's like, and with the, the, the envelope generator as well. There's one main board and we have actually four envelope generators planned out of it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. So, interesting. So, I don't want to get into the, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1946.315" data-end_ts="1946.665" title="1946.315" id=c_"1946.315">__which__</span> is better thing because I use both, Moog format and Euro, because of space constraint. Right now I'm focused primarily on Euro, but, I've <span style="color:red" data-ts="1959.665" data-end_ts="1959.885" title="1959.665" id=c_"1959.665">__had__</span>, I still own many, many MOG format modules and I love them. From your perspective, you have, you kind of wear many hats. You, you're a live performer. And I want to talk about a little more about the, in a second, but you're a manufacturer as well. Where do you, when you're making decisions about, like, for your performance, let's talk about your performance when you're making decisions, how do you decide which systems you're going to use? Because obviously you make 'em both, you probably use 'em both too, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>No. I actually like, have never used Eurorack live until like this Valentine's Day. Oh, really? I played a, yeah, I played a gig 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Where I, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2002.285" data-end_ts="2002.405" title="2002.285" id=c_"2002.285">__is__</span> that the chili gig that I, that I listened 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>To? Yeah, yeah, yeah. The, the sixth annual old Chili Cookoff or <span style="color:red" data-ts="2008.245" data-end_ts="2008.525" title="2008.245" id=c_"2008.245">__sent__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2008.525" data-end_ts="2008.645" title="2008.525" id=c_"2008.525">__the__</span> chili Cookoff. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Well, that was, frankly, that was when, you mentioned that you used your urac like demo unit there. And I think that was the first time I'd ever seen you in a picture actually using a Eurorack system live really 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2025.285" data-end_ts="2025.565" title="2025.285" id=c_"2025.285">__<crosstalk>__</span>. I have, I have one five you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Or the 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>Yeah, yeah. I have, I have one other photo of me playing live with the URAC system, and the gig was not recorded <laugh>, so it doesn't exist, which is sad. But I played, I played, at, there's, okay, there's a brewery, in Avington Virginia, called, Wolf Wolf Hills. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> Wolf Hills Brewery. Anyway, and I, I played there in July of 2014. I played the first gig in public with a Moog sub 37. I was very happy about this. Nice. And, I, I just spent a week in Asheville, like doing beta testing and patch programming for Moog. And then, drove up to, see my friend Watson in Bristol. And Abingdon is just up the road from Bristol. And I had booked a gig there. And, I used the sub 37 and I used my Eurorack demo system at the time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>And, I had built this keyboard rig that was supposed to be able to fit in my trunk that was based around like an MT eight and a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2104.065" data-end_ts="2104.285" title="2104.065" id=c_"2104.065">__mug__</span> mini tar, and a cord micro station, and a Innovation Ultra, or a mini Nova. And, a couple of other things. And I enjoyed playing the gig. It did. It was a, it was really unusual for the people that were there. They didn't really know what to make of it. The bartenders liked it. No one really, no one really complained. There was a couple people that got a little cranky, but I, I like to have a little friction in gigs. Sure. You need to set out to make music that's enjoyable to listen to. And I don't think that you need to <span style="color:red" data-ts="2142.145" data-end_ts="2142.365" title="2142.145" id=c_"2142.145">__pay__</span>, you don't need to pander to a crowd, but you need to make music that a reasonable person will enjoy. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>If you can do something that also irritates unreasonable people at the same time, <laugh>, that's a good goal. I'm not gonna say that I, I'm not gonna say like I want to outright antagonize a crowd, but I, I would like, there is an adversarial element to the music that I do because it is a little, for some people challenging. And I, this was, I, but I, this is the same way that I approached gigging with a soul band. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know, like I had this band where I played Hammond Organ and there was a guitar player and a drummer, and we would play some, some jazz and some <span style="color:red" data-ts="2190.785" data-end_ts="2191.065" title="2190.785" id=c_"2190.785">__soul__</span> tunes and some pop tunes. But it was the combination of the material. You know, you, you play like, okay, you play like, you know, Nelson Riddle Stolen Moments. Yeah. It's a great tune. Anyway, so you play Stolen Moments, followed up by an Isaac Hayes, cover <laugh>, and then an everything but the Girl Cover Uhhuh <affirmative>, and you're an organ trio. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>Right. Like, there are some people, it, it wasn't difficult to listen to. We weren't making difficult music. Right. But the, the music that we were playing basically represented what I'm into, which is I'm a wide variety of things. Sure. You know, I would listen to Isaac Hayes and then Nelson Riddle, and then everything <span style="color:red" data-ts="2234.305" data-end_ts="2234.465" title="2234.305" id=c_"2234.305">__with__</span> the Girl Uhhuh <affirmative>. But you know, some, most, a lot of people that like really like your, your Blues jam might not like it when you sing a pet shop Boys tune, even though for you it's all, it all, it's all very meaningful to you. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2250.025" data-end_ts="2250.185" title="2250.025" id=c_"2250.025">__You__</span> know, it's a natural fit. So. Well, it's, it's interesting 'cause what you're, what you're saying is that you want, you want the crowd to have a relatively large intersection point between a lot of different kinds of musics, or at least be able to enjoy them. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>Yes. Yeah. Yeah. And like, and the people that get irritated when they see that intersection, I relish antagonism 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Well, that's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>Awesome. Like, it, it, you know, or another <span style="color:red" data-ts="2278.705" data-end_ts="2278.945" title="2278.705" id=c_"2278.705">__thing__</span>, another way to put it is if you don't got haters, you ain't shit. Right. Okay. Yeah. And like <laugh> and I have always, I've always tried to live my life like that, so <laugh>. That's, that's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2289.785" data-end_ts="2289.865" title="2289.785" id=c_"2289.785">__true__</span>. But, I, I was, I was a little bit more rambunctious, say 10 years ago than I am now, but, I it's, it's still, it's still there. And so, like, I, I, I took the URAC system out on Valentine's Day because I, I, I was only gonna play for 30 minutes and I'd been playing a lot of piano playing, like, I'm, I'm an organist that just picked up piano like a year and a half ago or so when someone gave me a CP 70. Right. And so I'd been developing my piano voice, you know, and like I, through music that I was already a little, you know, that I was already familiar with and in love with, like, I have an arrangement of the Dr Who theme, you know, like the force melody from Star Wars Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b><affirmative>, stuff from Blade Runner, you know, and these are songs that I play when I, I, most people don't know this.

I have, I have a, I have a steak dinner, and I sit at the piano bar and drink old fashions and hang out with the, the married couple that plays there.

So I, I'd been working on this stuff with the piano, but I, I, it's like, first of all, like I'm supposed to play synthesizers at this thing. I don't wanna be a total dick and just bring a piano. Right. And I need, so I need some other textures, you know. And I added the Juno six on top, and I had just got the, TC electronic Ditto X four or Barringer Ditto X four as I'd like to call it <laugh>, because Behringer now owns tc. So keep that in <span style="color:red" data-ts="2417.685" data-end_ts="2417.765" title="2417.685" id=c_"2417.685">__<crosstalk>__</span>. Oh, do they really? I didn't know that.

I'm like, well, I could bring the MiniMogue, but I could also just bring my URE system <laugh> use this two octave keyboard controller <laugh>. Right. So that's, so that's what I did.

And you need to have something that does base pl. So I had the, between a combination of like the sustained button on the Juno and looping, I had that, that was that element. So the Juno six went through the ditto X four for looping, and then through the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2526.725" data-end_ts="2527.125" title="2526.725" id=c_"2526.725">__Eventide__</span> H 3000, I basically use my, my textural looping is basically I'm copycatting like nineties Robert Fripp, basically. Right, right. It's the, yeah.

</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b><laugh> and I, so I use the, so the, the, the two things that I need is I need a saw <span style="color:red" data-ts="2545.605" data-end_ts="2545.765" title="2545.605" id=c_"2545.605">__tooth__</span> wave with a filter cutoff. I need a looper and I need uneven tide. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I, I, you give me those three things and I can, I can sound close to Robert Fripp all night long if you want. Sure. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2559.785" data-end_ts="2560.005" title="2559.785" id=c_"2559.785">__If__</span>, if you, if you're talking about like, radio phonics, blessing of tears, 1999, like that, that period. Right. But, so that gave me that element. And then I played the piano, and then for the bass plex, I used the, yeah. And I, the, the piano is going through, a Corg SDD 3000 pedal and a lexicon, Alex Reverb, I love the mid nineties lexicon stuff. Uhhuh <affirmative>. It's, it's fantastic. I, you know, it's still, it's still <span style="color:red" data-ts="2589.365" data-end_ts="2589.565" title="2589.365" id=c_"2589.365">__hard__</span>. You cannot get a better reverb for $80 than a lexicon, Alex. Right, right. Especially when you open it up and change the game stage so that like, it, it doesn't hiss like a motherfucker. Oh yeah. You, well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>One of the things that I recognize, or 'cause I've long loved playing with reverb and drenching everything in reverb, it's a particular love of mine. And, there was a change in the lexicon reverb sound that happened in the two thousands as a result of something. I don't know exactly what, you know, changing tastes or changing algorithms or something, but 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>All of a sudden, I, I can tell you exactly what happened. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>No, please do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>Lexicon was acquired by Harman International in the mid nineties. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>Two things. A lot of the sound like the lexicon had application specific integrated circuits. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Okay. Called the, the Lexi ship. Okay. They basically, like, they had been working for like 15 years. They worked on taking like the big stuff like, the two 40 or whatever. Right. And then like condensing it into smaller and smaller electronics until they arrived at the Lexi ship. And the Lexi Ship two, which are what the, like, so the, the MPX 100 mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, the MPX one, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2666.325" data-end_ts="2666.605" title="2666.325" id=c_"2666.325">__Alex__</span>. Right. They have the Lexi ship in them. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And what the, the Lexi <span style="color:red" data-ts="2671.395" data-end_ts="2671.685" title="2671.395" id=c_"2671.395">__chip__</span> is, is it's, it's this, it's a processor designed totally to do the mass modulated delay cluster. That is the lexicon reverb. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>It's totally optimized for this. Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>And when they stopped using the Lexi <span style="color:red" data-ts="2693.955" data-end_ts="2694.245" title="2693.955" id=c_"2693.955">__chip__</span> and they started using commodity DSPs, it lost the, it lost a lot of that character. Okay. I see. It's like why the even Tide will never make anything that sounds like a 3000 until they make me a product developer for them Uhhuh <affirmative>. Okay. Because they will not do what needs to be done to model what the 3000 <span style="color:red" data-ts="2719.225" data-end_ts="2719.445" title="2719.225" id=c_"2719.225">__can__</span>. They don't understand that the 3000 is what people associate with <span style="color:red" data-ts="2723.125" data-end_ts="2723.565" title="2723.125" id=c_"2723.125">__Eventide__</span> sound. I won't use any new <span style="color:red" data-ts="2724.845" data-end_ts="2725.285" title="2724.845" id=c_"2724.845">__eventide__</span> stuff. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, it all sounds terrible. Like it's so clean and like, I mean, I'm sure it sounds great for if you want to, if you want the sound of an Orville, that's great. I don't want that sound. I want the 3000, the 3000 is what's on the pop, the all the pop records and the, you know, like all the, the crazy electronic records that make you won an Eventide Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>Used <span style="color:red" data-ts="2746.445" data-end_ts="2746.565" title="2746.445" id=c_"2746.445">__to__</span> 3000. Right. They didn't use the DSP series, you know, so like the, the more that like advanced, the, the, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2753.425" data-end_ts="2753.645" title="2753.425" id=c_"2753.425">__you__</span> know, I hope someone from Eventide is listening so their blood can boil when they hear me complain about it. You know, the, the reason that the 3000 sounds, the way it does is because of the programming and also the fact that it has, it has this weird architecture that's created by like, the kind of DSPs that they had to use at the time. They had to use three dss, three DSPs in the 3000. Oh, interesting. And they're very primitive DSPs. They're not mo they're not Motorola 56 K based. Okay. You would have to have the corporate backing of a company like Eventide to even attempt to copy what is in the 3000. You have to have access to the ip. You also have to have, like, you have to have a really well <span style="color:red" data-ts="2797.925" data-end_ts="2798.125" title="2797.925" id=c_"2797.925">__hung__</span> electrical engineer. It is possible to copy what's in the even <span style="color:red" data-ts="2802.355" data-end_ts="2802.645" title="2802.355" id=c_"2802.355">__Tide__</span> 3000, but you're not gonna just, you're not gonna do it with a 56 K ship, that's for sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, one thing I was gonna ask you about in regards to this is if you found any like software things that work for you, but it sounds like you don't really mess around with software and synthesis at all, or software and recording. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>No, I don't. No. No. I, I use, I use software for compositing. I'll tell you what, what plugins I use. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I use, I use whatever comes with digital performer. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2834.235" data-end_ts="2834.525" title="2834.235" id=c_"2834.235">__Okay__</span>. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Alright. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>I don't, I don't use any third party plugins. None. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. Well, that's, you picked a good use. You picked a good, a good one to hang your hat on because the, the plugin development work that they do at MOTU is pretty outrageous. They, they've made some amazing sounding stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>Oh, yeah. Yeah. And also like, I mean, I, like, I have a, I've got a drum and bass track that I haven't released yet. I did a, a few years ago actually, I'm just waiting for, I'm waiting to get around to doing another drum and bass track so I can do like a, a 12 inch of that. Right? Sure. I basically have a, I did a deep house 12 inch, a couple years ago. It was a remix of a Dorian Electric song called Fast Cash, which is about the, the dangers of low interest rates. It, it came together pretty quickly because I had, I had enough material that like fit together to just, you know, make it happen. But I have like half completed dance, 12 inches like lying around. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2894.285" data-end_ts="2894.365" title="2894.285" id=c_"2894.285">__I__</span> need <span style="color:red" data-ts="2894.445" data-end_ts="2894.525" title="2894.445" id=c_"2894.445">__to__</span> finish. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>Right. You know, so I'm, I'm definitely most interested in doing more dance 12 inches even though it's, it's a, it's a completely pop. 12 inches are one thing, but like DJs don't use records anymore. Right. So, you know, like the only way that you can go more archaic than doing vinyl is to do dance vinyl <laugh>. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, you can always pull out the eight track recorder if you need to, but yeah, that is some, that is a bit of obscurity at this point. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>So I, when I made the, I made this drum and bass track, which basically sounds like, like a early nineties LTJ Bookham thing, that was kind of where I was going for. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>I took a, I took a drum part from this band that I had recorded this blues band from Springfield that I had recorded in my studio. The track was called L Loving Ways, whatever. Anyway, great. Really, really neat band was called This Band's, the band was named Black Magic Johnson anyway. Okay. Really, really, really cool, really cool band. And, I took this two <span style="color:red" data-ts="2956.705" data-end_ts="2956.925" title="2956.705" id=c_"2956.705">__bar__</span> drum loop or two bar drum intro, and then I pitched it up. I, I basically like chopped it into eighth notes and loaded it into the drum sampler in performer. Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>And it did everything I needed a sampler to do. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2975.465" data-end_ts="2975.685" title="2975.465" id=c_"2975.465">__Oh__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>You know, if, like, if you can't make a, if you can't do breakbeats with the sampler that comes with digital performer, then you're, you're just, you're not trying <laugh>. Right. Right. I don't know how <span style="color:red" data-ts="2988.045" data-end_ts="2988.165" title="2988.045" id=c_"2988.045">__to__</span> get it. Like, it sounds great, like Yeah, it's fine. You don't, you don't need contact. Just use that. Don't complicate your life. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Well, I think, I think a lot of it is getting the right source material too. I mean that you had Oh, yeah. You know, obviously you'd identified in your head that here was, here was a groove and a, and a drum sound and a drum track that was gonna make good source material. And I think that goes a long way towards getting a decent break beat too. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. But you know, I'm just saying like, if you do have the right drum loop, you have, if you do have the right source material, like if you wanna do chopped up drums, like I think it's called Model 12 or something like that is the Right, so is the, is the drum sequence? Yeah, the drum sampler plugin. Like it's, it's fine. It's fine. The, sometimes I use the con revolving reverb in performer, but usually, actually I will say the, the only, the, the two third party plugins that I use the most are the Eventide H 3000 and the Lexicon PC M 80. And I just like run audio out to them and then run it back in <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah. That's smart. That's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>Smart. I also do some, my only outboard compressor is a, is a, is a Deni tape recorder. Oh, really? That I, yeah, I, because it, you can monitor off of, you can, there's a <span style="color:red" data-ts="3067.695" data-end_ts="3067.895" title="3067.695" id=c_"3067.695">__monitor__</span>, there's a separate monitor head, so you can actually like record to it and then monitor in real time what is being put to tape. So you can use it as a short tape delay. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>And then saturate the hell out of it. And you can actually, like, that's cool. The, like, one of the problems with doing that with most tape decks is that the analog input section of most tape decks, the analog section, both input and output cannot handle the hot levels that you get when you're actually saturating cassette tape. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Okay. So you need to have a really high quality deck to be able to do this. Right. And that's, so that's why I use that deni for <span style="color:red" data-ts="3114.115" data-end_ts="3114.195" title="3114.115" id=c_"3114.115">__that__</span> denon. Sure. And it's the, the drums on that, on that drum and bass track. I, I did that drum loop did, I mean the, the drum take went through the tape deck and back in, you know, the other, the other plugin that I use is, the other side of my building. I have a mic over there and basically like, when I'm tracking drums or whatever, I record <span style="color:red" data-ts="3139.005" data-end_ts="3139.355" title="3139.005" id=c_"3139.005">__waste__</span> level side mics on the drums, using large diaphragm dynamics or large diaphragm condensers, like I think IAKG C3 thousands. Right. Okay. I've got a, a bass drum mic, can't remember which one it is. It's some Sure. And a beta 57 on the underside of the snare. And then I got another beta 57 in the, in the next room. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And it just listens to that room and I record that on a fifth track and it's the best drum sound I've ever heard <laugh>, so. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's awesome. Yeah. You know, it's, it's funny if you look at the history of some of the great recording studios, so often there's a story like that, like, you know, we set up a, a mic in this one spot and it was like the magic thing that actually made this room great. You know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>It's cool. Well, I don't think it's there. I don't think there's a man, like, I'm not gonna try to claim that I have a magic spot for the mic. I'm just getting the sound of the drums reverberating, like the drums are moving from my room and then bouncing into the room next door. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and then bouncing around that room. I don't think it would matter where I pointed at <span style="color:red" data-ts="3207.045" data-end_ts="3207.205" title="3207.045" id=c_"3207.045">__my__</span> camera 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Right. It just would end up good in there. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>Yeah. You know, everybody's favorite, like everyone says like, I want it to sound like John Bonum or whatever, <laugh>, you know, it's like, like I have a basement, it's like eight feet, like my basement is seven feet tall and it's, the room's about 10 by 13. How do I sound like John Bonum? Right. I'm like, you're never gonna sound like John Bonum in that room. Yeah. Like, like when the levy, like the drums on, when the levee breaks, they had, they recorded those drums in the foyer of this like four story mansion. They put <span style="color:red" data-ts="3240.325" data-end_ts="3240.545" title="3240.325" id=c_"3240.325">__dr__</span> they put a couple drums on the drum kit, but then they put another mic, like four stories up and pointed at the ceiling. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> or something. It was something like that, you know, it's like that's, it's, it's the room. The room sounded like that. You know, I like, I love electronic reverb and I don't just like electronic reverb. I love it, but I love it on electronic instruments. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. One of the things I would say is that you're actually really particular about your equipment choices. And it unlike, unlike a lot of people that I, that I have interacted with, you don't seem to have, there's, there's not a like time-based Catholicism Exactly. To it. Right. Because you do use, you do use some modern stuff and you use some stuff that's related to the music you love, but you're also like really informed and you're using techniques and concepts from, from ages ago. Then when I look at pictures of your gear, I mean from the chili gay gear, I <laugh>, I saw that picture of you at the, at the, at the Chili Cookoff thing. <laugh>. And my first, and my first thought was, Hey dude, how's your back doing? Because you have like, except for Hammond, Oregon, which apparently you didn't bring that night. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You have every backbreaker in the business practically. Oh, you don't have a roads with you, but you have a CP 70, which is just a killer to haul around. You got a big old June <span style="color:red" data-ts="3331.465" data-end_ts="3331.665" title="3331.465" id=c_"3331.465">__oh__</span> six, you got a rack <span style="color:red" data-ts="3333.245" data-end_ts="3333.465" title="3333.245" id=c_"3333.245">__of__</span> outboard gear, you got a modular synth and you know, but you are obviously making some very thoughtful choices and I'm curious to hear from you, what is it that makes things work for you? What is it about a CP 70, or what is it about a Hammond or why the June <span style="color:red" data-ts="3355.865" data-end_ts="3356.065" title="3355.865" id=c_"3355.865">__oh__</span> six versus the 60 versus the 1 0 6? You know, there are choices to be made here. What, how do you make those choices? What are the things that speak to you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>This is a very, very, very good question. So let me start by saying that my normal keyboard rig is carried in a trailer and, and the, what I took to the empty bottle was a light rig <laugh>. Okay. Jesus. So my normal keyboard rig, goes, yeah, goes in a trailer. There is a five and a half foot tall rack. There is a road case for the 60 <span style="color:red" data-ts="3400.745" data-end_ts="3400.965" title="3400.745" id=c_"3400.745">__mo__</span> unit modular system. I have, a drum machine case called the Hot Mix five that has, corgi SX 9 0 9 8 0 8 <span style="color:red" data-ts="3413.125" data-end_ts="3413.245" title="3413.125" id=c_"3413.125">__a__</span> Twoo 60, and a Xox <span style="color:red" data-ts="3415.165" data-end_ts="3415.365" title="3415.165" id=c_"3415.165">__box__</span> in it. And, it actually, that case goes on a custom cart. It can only be moved on that cart. And it, the, the case is 30 inches wide and it's 60 inches long. And then another case goes on top of that that has my, had my mini mug, now my sub 37 and the Blow Feld in it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>And then there's also, a Corg, Kronos and a Kronos gets <span style="color:red" data-ts="3449.965" data-end_ts="3450.205" title="3449.965" id=c_"3449.965">__carried__</span>. I'm still working on the case for that station. I'm trying to work everything into, so that it fits into a certain number of, of, like a, like the, the hot mix. Five is its own case. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, the keyboard station that has like the, the sub 37, the Feld, that's its own case. Haven't quite got the case together for the central station with the, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="3473.475" data-end_ts="3473.765" title="3473.475" id=c_"3473.475">__cord__</span> Kronos and the King cog, which also has the, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3479.625" data-end_ts="3479.845" title="3479.625" id=c_"3479.625">__cog__</span> pad control to control two Oberheim echo plexes in the main rack. And, and a boss RC 5 0 5 Looper, which is what the king cog goes through. The Echoplex is for looping of the Kronos. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And then also next to the RC 5 0 5 is a two octave MIDI keyboard controller to transpose the modular. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>Now, that is one of two, two octave keyboard controllers that are in my live rig to transpose the modular. The other one is underneath the modular. The reason that I have two keyboard controllers for this, they get merged in a mo <span style="color:red" data-ts="3513.685" data-end_ts="3513.845" title="3513.685" id=c_"3513.685">__two__</span> midi time piece, and then spit back out into the midi <span style="color:red" data-ts="3519.625" data-end_ts="3519.845" title="3519.625" id=c_"3519.625">__to__</span> CV module on the synthesizer is that if I'm soloing on the sub 37 or something, you know, if I'm pointed in the direction of the keyboards at the front of my rig, I wanna be able to transpose the modular there as well as when I'm Oh, sure. Of course. Facing the modular. Right. You know, so when I'm facing the modular, I can do, I can transpose the sequences, I can transpose the modular with that little keyboard. But I also am changing chords on the Juno 60, which is almost always being used for some sort of rhythmic arpeggiator thing that is being, I don't, I'm not using the Juno to play chords in my, in my live, in my live rig. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>The main, the main rig, the, the, as Chris Pearson calls it, the hover tank <laugh>, the Juno that I brought to the empty bottle was a Juno six instead of a Juno 60, because the 60 is in my, the other rig. Okay. They both sound the same. I actually prefer the sound of the <span style="color:red" data-ts="3582.915" data-end_ts="3583.205" title="3582.915" id=c_"3582.915">__Juno__</span> six. But the, the, my Juno six needs a little bit of work. I actually have three Junos. I have a, a Juno six that I got in 1995 from one of the two guys that named me suit and tie guy, I should add. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, that <span style="color:red" data-ts="3601.845" data-end_ts="3602.135" title="3601.845" id=c_"3601.845">__Juno__</span> six is actually signed by Bail <span style="color:red" data-ts="3603.375" data-end_ts="3603.535" title="3603.375" id=c_"3603.375">__of__</span> Fleck <span style="color:red" data-ts="3603.735" data-end_ts="3603.855" title="3603.735" id=c_"3603.735">__and__</span> the LEC <span style="color:red" data-ts="3604.135" data-end_ts="3604.375" title="3604.135" id=c_"3604.135">__tone__</span> <laugh>.

</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>But I have, I got a <span style="color:red" data-ts="3622.725" data-end_ts="3623.015" title="3622.725" id=c_"3622.725">__Juno__</span> 60 from Angelo Metz traded him some trigger sequencers. He gave me a <span style="color:red" data-ts="3627.165" data-end_ts="3627.455" title="3627.165" id=c_"3627.165">__Juno__</span> 60, and then, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3629.565" data-end_ts="3629.855" title="3629.565" id=c_"3629.565">__Juno__</span> six came up for sale in Chicago so cheap that I had to buy it immediately. So that's why I have three Junos. The Juno is like my favorite keyboard. Yeah. Basically, because like, it always sounds good and you never, you, you, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3644.435" data-end_ts="3644.655" title="3644.435" id=c_"3644.435">__you__</span>, it just always sounds good, you know, you just set the knobs to whatever. It'll sound good, I promise.

It's not that important. I definitely prefer either to the 1 0 6. Reason number one is the arpeggiator. The arpeggiator <span style="color:red" data-ts="3664.615" data-end_ts="3664.815" title="3664.615" id=c_"3664.615">__on__</span> the June oh six is the best arpeggiator ever made until the sub 37 came along, which has a better arpeggiator because I was involved in, in making in, I was involved in that. So <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>And the reason I took the CP 70 instead of a digital piano is that I don't own a digital piano. I played one gig with the CP 70, and I said, I'm never gonna do this again. I immediately like called up Cassio and was like, I want a PX five s like dollar for dollar. I think the Cassio PX five s is Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> is, it's, it's what I went for. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. I've got a Kronos, it's got a great piano sound on it, but I don't like the new Corg. I don't, I don't like the corg weighted keys. They're really, really hard on your hands. Yeah. I don't even like the new Yama key beds. Yeah. The ca like the Cassio is my favorite key bed right now. So as far as like a weighted keyboard goes, but as you know, like carrying the organ is one thing. It's easy to move an organ around because you just <span style="color:red" data-ts="3720.175" data-end_ts="3720.335" title="3720.175" id=c_"3720.175">__had__</span>, it's on wheels, you know, you just put wheels on it and wheel it in, take it to the gig. You take the wheels off and put the pedalboard on. You're, you know, Bob's your uncle <span style="color:red" data-ts="3728.965" data-end_ts="3729.255" title="3728.965" id=c_"3728.965">__that__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Makes CP 70. That makes a great assumption that you don't have to carry it up many steps. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>Yeah. Well then you just don't take gigs that have <span style="color:red" data-ts="3736.015" data-end_ts="3736.255" title="3736.015" id=c_"3736.015">__stairs__</span>. I did my last stair gig in 2006 and I said, you know what, never ever again am I gonna go upstairs. Ever. And then you just, you know, what happens when you, when you make that decision, you wind up not ever having to play a gig that has stairs involved. Right. Ever again. Right. You know, don't just take a gig just because someone's offering you a gig. You don't have to, you know, I don't care how much somebody pays me, but I don't want them to make my life hard. Right. To play the gig. Okay. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3763.755" data-end_ts="3764.045" title="3763.755" id=c_"3763.755">__Yeah__</span>. Like, I will drive, I'll drive six hours and play a gig in a cornfield for fucking a hundred bucks when I have done that. But they treat me really well, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3773.545" data-end_ts="3773.765" title="3773.545" id=c_"3773.545">__and__</span> they treat me with respect, and they don't ask me to go upstairs. Right, right. You know, someone asks you to go upstairs, they're not respecting you, you know, have some self-respect when you're gigging. So I, so I don't do stair gigs, and I have taken a Hammond organ upstairs. I have done four gigs, three gigs, three or four gigs where I took the organ upstairs. So my, my suggestion is, don't ever do that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Well, clearly you'll learn something and, and, we're able to change your lifestyle to fit beyond, beyond some of those things. Like, like your choice of your choice of effects or your choice of microphones or your choices of recording gear and stuff like that. How do you make determinations? Does it generally, and, and I guess I would, I would ask this way. Do you tend see for me, if I really, if I'm really self, if I'm really thoughtful about things, far more has to do with the feel than either the sound Yeah. Or the performance of anything, whether it's software or hardware. A sequencer. A synthesizer, a key bed, or even I'm a guitarist or a guitar or whatever. I can accept a guitar that sounds funny. Or it might be green with pictures of Gilligan's Island characters on it, <laugh>. But if it feels right, I'm buying a damn thing Uhhuh. Right. And so you would 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>You, would you play, I wanna know, would, would you, would you play like a Teal Green Ivanez Iceman covered with, with Happy Face stickers? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, you bet. I would if it felt right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>Okay. Cool, cool, cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Because I've been, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>I just like a friend of mine has a teal green iceman covered with that's with yellow Happy Face 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Stick, you know? But I can tell you, I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>Probably, he plays the ambient stuff 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>On it. I probably actually wouldn't because the feel of that body, it wouldn't fit right on my body, I don't think. Of course. Who knows, maybe, maybe it would, maybe my body is malformed enough that it would be perfect. I don't know. Yeah. <laugh>. But anyway, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What are, what are the things that you look for? Because it <span style="color:red" data-ts="3897.605" data-end_ts="3897.885" title="3897.605" id=c_"3897.605">__sounds__</span>, seems like a lot of your stuff is really oriented towards sound. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>I would say like sometimes I'm really particular and sometimes I'm, I'm not. Okay. It's like I might have mentioned that I had, that I used like C3 thousands 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>To mic up a drum kit. Okay. The reason I <span style="color:red" data-ts="3915.325" data-end_ts="3915.485" title="3915.325" id=c_"3915.325">__use__</span> C3 thousands is because that's what I had laying around. Now they're, they're nice C 3000, they're like the Austrian C3 thousands before a KG started building their stuff in China. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But, you know, they're just like a pair of mics that in the nineties when I was putting on punk rock shows, which is something we didn't talk about, but it, it, I it's something I did was like, locally, I was a, I was the primary punk rock show promoter in Peoria for about a three year period. My, my friend James got into recording the gigs or the, the shows. Okay. So I have this large dat archive of shows from Peoria punk rock shows from 1996 to 1999 <laugh> Cool. Which is kind of funny. But, we, we, he, he bought everything in pairs. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>So we had pairs of C 1000 mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know, a pair of C3 thousands. He got these BSS Mike Preempts as a pair. Right. Because Sweetwater was blowing them out. 'cause no one wanted them. But this <span style="color:red" data-ts="3977.485" data-end_ts="3977.725" title="3977.485" id=c_"3977.485">__Mike__</span> Preempt cost a thousand dollars in 1997. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> 1997 money, a thousand dollars for Mike. Pre-EMP was a lot of money. It's real money. So, and, but you go looking for information about the, about the, what is this? The BSS ffc S nine 16, you'll never find it on the internet. There's like one review of this thing for Mixed Magazine in like 1996. And it wasn't even a review. It's like a mention in like a rundown of like what preamps are available this year, you know? And, so I don't, I don't have these BSS preempts because like, there's some sort of magical preamp. They're just what's around. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>I wound up getting all of his stuff when he he liquidated. I see. You know, so I got, I got that stuff. The reason that I have the PV PV five 20 I, large diaphragm dynamic for doing podcasts is because in 1996, I needed a, I put on a show, or 97, no, it was 97. I put on a punk rock show where I needed, I was short on mics and I had to go to the music store and like rent a microphone. And they rented me a pair of these things, and I thought they were brilliant, and I promptly forgot about 'em. And then like one day, like last year or a year, two years ago, I was like, Hey, I, I could probably afford one of those. I bet I could get a couple of those PV mics now. And lo and behold, I got, I found four, I found, I found two pairs at two different new old stock pairs at two different times. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>The first pair I bought for myself and my friend Caleb came over and fell in love with it. So I bought one for him. And then there's a podcaster that I really, that I really like that I wanted to, I wanted to help him out. He had a really shitty mic, so I bought one as a gift for him too. And he, he still uses it. So like, that, that choice was kind of an, that was an ad that was accidental. Okay. Uhhuh, <affirmative>. The other things I'm very particular about Loopers. Okay. There's, there's the, the best looper ever made is the Oberheim Echoplex period. And there's, there's no, there's no getting around it. I use the boss RC 5 0 5 because it's the, it's the, it's the second best. Looper. <laugh>. Okay. And then, third best Looper is the, is the new, the Beringer. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>Ditto. X four mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, which they've, they've finally made, Beringer has finally made a, or TC electronic or whatever you wanna call 'em now, has finally made a looper that has a feedback control on it. Oh, well, this thing, the Ditto X four does things that up until now could only be done with an OB iPlex, which is going from record <span style="color:red" data-ts="4138.745" data-end_ts="4138.965" title="4138.745" id=c_"4138.745">__in__</span> a lot of, some things have done record into overdub record into overdub is very important. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But what if you want to go from record immediately into reverse? Right. Well, the Ditto X four can do that. This is the only looper other than the Ober Echoplex that can go from record into reverse or from record into half speed. It can pull a trick off that even the Echoplex can't, it can go from record into reverse and overdub at the same time or half speed and overdub at the same time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>You know, so like, so yes. Like that, that thing right there. It's very, it's very particular, you know, my I music instruments or re you know, reverbs effects are very particular. Like, you know, like I really like lexicon reverbs, I like <span style="color:red" data-ts="4183.605" data-end_ts="4184.165" title="4183.605" id=c_"4183.605">__eventide__</span> alien landscape <span style="color:red" data-ts="4185.365" data-end_ts="4185.565" title="4185.365" id=c_"4185.365">__or__</span>, you know, reverb, you know, but I'm, I don't ha I don't fetishize things just because they're old. I have an 8 0 8 and a 9 0 9 like, and they've been in my live rig. I've been using 'em live for six years now. Okay. I've been, I've been using a 9 0 9 for 13 years. I love it. It's my favorite drum machine. But you know what, I just got two T eights and the T 8 0 8 and the 9 0 9 are going to leave the hot <span style="color:red" data-ts="4211.465" data-end_ts="4211.685" title="4211.465" id=c_"4211.465">__mix__</span> five, and they're now going to stay in the studio and I'm gonna use a pair of T eights. Wow. The T eight sounds that good. Okay. That's cool. It sounds that good. And it is that easy to use. And, you know, you set one TR eight up with 8 0 8 sounds, the other one with 9 0 9 sounds so, and I think it'll improve my music because it's easier to interact with than <span style="color:red" data-ts="4233.765" data-end_ts="4233.845" title="4233.765" id=c_"4233.765">__the__</span> old stuff. So no, I'm not, I'm not a historical fetishist. I just want, I just want the best things right 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now. I, I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>Took the mini <span style="color:red" data-ts="4241.725" data-end_ts="4242.005" title="4241.725" id=c_"4241.725">__mode__</span> outta my rig and I use a sub 37 instead of the mini <span style="color:red" data-ts="4244.785" data-end_ts="4245.005" title="4244.785" id=c_"4244.785">__mug__</span>. Now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, one of the things I'm curious about, though, now, because you mentioned two devices that I've used the TRH some, but I was really into the RC 5 0 5 for a while, and eventually one of the things I notice happens to me sometimes is I'll find a thing, it may do a hundred percent of what I want it to do, but if there's something else about it that really irritates me, eventually it's gonna like worm into my spine until I just am like, I gotta get rid of it. <laugh>. You know, and that was the case with the RC 5 0 5. I loved the way it worked. I loved, I mean, I'm not normally a big fan of like the, the neon lights on Broadway style of user interface. Right. But yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>I, I like the feedback on the 5 0 5. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I was gonna say, I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>Think it's really 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Informative in their case, the way that they do that moving ring. It really lets you know where you're at in the loops and stuff. But the, the effects that are built into that, I don't know how, I don't know how Boss can put their name on something. Boss is a company that makes effects. How can they put their name on something that has such pitiful, pitiful effects? Right. And it was one of those things where I like the Looper and I like the fact that I could do either synchronized or Desynchronized loops. Everything about it was right. But those, those effects, they were there and they could be used, but I, you try to use 'em and they sounded so bad. And finally I was like, I can't even stand having this thing around because of this like, flaw. You know, it was almost like, it, it almost like upset me, in a way that I couldn't get over. And I mean, you surely run into that because you've got a lot of gear and you've interacted with a lot of gear. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>I, I use, I use what, I use things for what they're good at. So I don't, I don't use the shitty effects on the 5 0 5. I use the good ones. The good ones are, the, the Slicer. Yeah. And, slicer and scatter and that's it. Like I, I, I love, I love the slicer on that thing. Like, you just load up. I mean, I want to get a Boss Slicer pedal now because I didn't realize how cool it would like. Okay. So like one of my, one of my big influences is <span style="color:red" data-ts="4393.525" data-end_ts="4393.645" title="4393.525" id=c_"4393.525">__the__</span>, is the KLF and the KLF were the first dance act to incorporate a technique of taking a <span style="color:red" data-ts="4402.125" data-end_ts="4402.325" title="4402.125" id=c_"4402.125">__pa__</span> taking a track or a pad running through Noise Gate and then keying the noise gate from the high-hat track. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> the Shaman or the Shaman or whatever. They took that technique and went crazy from the KLF and then built a whole sound out of it. Right. But it's a really important part of the KLF sound. And like, it didn't occur to me how handy it would be to have something like that until I got the 5 0 5 and it had the slicer integrated, you know, this, the, the slicer integrated into it. So I'm always like using that thing live. The other thing that I use is the, I can't remember the name of the effect now. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I know what you're talking 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>About. You turn it. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. You turn 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>It, you turn it on and <span style="color:red" data-ts="4445.605" data-end_ts="4445.685" title="4445.605" id=c_"4445.605">__it__</span> like, like 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You determine like how stutter, how deep it, I think it is stutter. You determine like how much it's going to, it, it reminds me of a lot of like the beat 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>Repeats kinda thing. It loops as soon as you engage the effect, it just starts looping a current, like whatever's current, like Right. It loops a certain amount of time. Like, goes all the way from one bar down to like 32nd notes. Okay. Right. And like <span style="color:red" data-ts="4474.675" data-end_ts="4474.965" title="4474.675" id=c_"4474.675">__that__</span>, that effect, I use that all the time. I use it in a, apparently, like, it took me about a year to figure out that it had a reverse mode. So it'll like, it'll like stutter in reverse. So I'll have a loop going on it and then like, I'll like reverse the track for like, just, just a moment as like a, as like a part of a fill or like leading into a new part coming in or something like that. You know. So I, I don't know. Like, I just, I don't use the reverb on it. I don't use the reverb on any of my keyboards 'cause it's all terrible. It is all terrible. Like when you, when you've got a lexicon PCM 80 in your rack, you're not worried about why are you gonna use the reverb on your 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Chrome not gonna use 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>When you've got a lexicon. Good point. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>So, so I just, I use things for what they're good at and if they have enough for what they're good at to make me happy, then I get excited about 'em. Like, and also the other thing that, the other thing that's really important to me is how effective a tool is for how much it's worth. There are, there are synthesizers out there that sound better for virtual analog sounds than a king cog, but the King cog is only worth $800 if I have to replace it. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know, the value of the TR eight versus the value. Like, I, you know, one of that, one of the considerations in moving from the 9 0 9 and the 8 0 8 to a pair of T eights is that if I replay, like I was able to get a pair of T eights, like I can't even tell you how much I paid because like I tr like, you know, I got them, I can't tell you how much I paid because I got them from one of my dealers. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>Right. You know, like I can replace tier eights very easily. Right. If someone steals my 9 0 9, it's gonna kill me. Sure. You know, like, I mean, I'll never be able to replace it. So like, you know, taking like $6,000 worth of drum machines out of your rig and replacing them with a thousand dollars worth of drum machines, that <span style="color:red" data-ts="4599.675" data-end_ts="4600.025" title="4599.675" id=c_"4599.675">__makes__</span> a lot of sense. That sound just as good. <span style="color:red" data-ts="4601.855" data-end_ts="4602.145" title="4601.855" id=c_"4601.855">__Yeah__</span>. Yeah. Yeah. It makes, it makes sense. So like, you know, like I have a, I have a chord Kronos, you know, but I don't have like a Kronos 88. I don't even have a new Kronos. I've got the first generation Kronos Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know, it's like, the sub 37 sounds fantastic and it costs less than a mini Moog d you know, so like if something happens to the sub 37, you know, I can call up Moog and <span style="color:red" data-ts="4625.495" data-end_ts="4625.785" title="4625.495" id=c_"4625.495">__give__</span> another one, give them some money and, and they'll give me another one. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>But if I had, if I lost my mini mog DI can't, how effective something is for how much it costs is an important consideration. Not just, not just for replacement aspect, but also for respect. As in like when something does a really good job and it's cheap, I like it even more <laugh>, like the Ditto X four, you know, this is a stereo 24 bit looper that has feedback control and can go from record into reverse and it costs $250 and it synchronizes to midi. There's nothing, nothing <span style="color:red" data-ts="4662.445" data-end_ts="4662.765" title="4662.445" id=c_"4662.445">__better__</span>. Like I can't even, I mean, the Echoplex is still the God emperor of Loopers. Okay. But I can never recommend that somebody buy an Echoplex now that the <span style="color:red" data-ts="4672.525" data-end_ts="4672.645" title="4672.525" id=c_"4672.525">__video__</span> X four is available, even though I hate, I hate Beringer with a passion. And it's for professional reasons, by the way, because the Beringer's chip fab fucked up an order and have, have not fixed it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>Okay. So like the chips <span style="color:red" data-ts="4686.685" data-end_ts="4686.765" title="4686.685" id=c_"4686.685">__in__</span> the Mankato, the, the 2164, I have to buy them from Beringer's Chip Fab, it's called Cool Audio. They're the only people that still make this chip. The last time I ordered from Cool Audio, they sent me the wrong chips. They wouldn't fix it. And it delayed releasing the man re-releasing the Mankato for five months trying to deal with this because I had the investment of the chips that I had to recover from. I'm not, I don't, I'm not rolling in dough over here. Right. So when somebody, like, you know, when somebody rips me off on an order like that, then it makes, it makes me angry. Yeah. And I kind of like made a scene at NAMM this year when I was at the T like when I was at the Beringer booth and like had to deal with people that didn't even like people who work for Beringer that don't even know they have a chip fab. Right. They don't even know, like, they don't like <span style="color:red" data-ts="4737.765" data-end_ts="4738.045" title="4737.765" id=c_"4737.765">__people__</span>. Beringer is so big now, people who work for Beringer don't even know like how many companies Beringer owns. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Someday I have to do a podcast where I just talk about some of these practically everything that we saw at the NAMM show was controlled sort of by a couple of companies. You know, I think a lot of people never really caught that Beringer scooped up Midas and, you know, and, and these things kind of happened. Yeah. And there's a result to that. There's a result to the industry when, you know, only a few players are responsible for making the majority of the gear. And, I think that there's, you know, that has the potential for being a dangerous track <span style="color:red" data-ts="4778.705" data-end_ts="4778.925" title="4778.705" id=c_"4778.705">__or__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="4778.925" data-end_ts="4779.125" title="4778.925" id=c_"4778.925">__say__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="4779.125" data-end_ts="4779.325" title="4779.125" id=c_"4779.125">__That__</span> Well that's, but that's, that's the importance of the boutique market, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>Is that like we, like, whereas like that consolidation is going on up there, it's like the boutique is getting more, you know, like my booth was across the aisle from Hammond. I got to be Isle buddies with my friends from Chicago that make organs. Right. The Hammond Hammond, like my, I mean Hammond a name that has been around since <span style="color:red" data-ts="4805.685" data-end_ts="4805.925" title="4805.685" id=c_"4805.685">__nine__</span>, like 1938 to now, okay. 75 years this company has been making organs and they're still the best Hammond organs. Okay. Like what Hammond makes, there's nobody that can touch what Hammond does. Their clone wheel organs are better than everyone else's. Period. Hands down, no contest, no argument. Will, will, arm wrestle all night about this and to be across the aisle from them. Like, it was exhilarating for me. You know, like I turn around and like Dr. Lonnie Smith is like right there, you know, like, Hey, Lonnie, come over. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>Like check the this thing out. I'm calling it the carpet bagger. And he just like, laughs a little bit <laugh>. You know, he, it's not like I'd already met him a few times. You know, I've, I I think I, the first time I I saw him play was like 1999 or 2000 or something. But being able to see, you know, like have this comfort, like it was just amazing. So like, but that's the boutique. And now you see the larger companies, they are taking cues from the boutique market. Okay. Right. So now the boutique is what is driving things ahead, because what the big guys focused on for so long are rompers and workstations. And then, you know, and then you had this period where nobody was building new hardware because everyone was, it was all like, it was all like, hardware's dead. You know, we're just gonna, I'll use laptops and shitty fucking USB controllers that'll break after three gigs. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>So what that, what that period, that seven, eight year period in electronic music did was destroy the major company's ability to make mid-range instruments. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And that prevented, that presented a market vacuum for people like me to come along and thrive. And I'm totally thankful for it. I'm not gonna lie, I foresaw this happening when it was going on because here I was playing like hardware, you know, I did this show and like, I played a show with Richard Devine in 2005 in Atlanta. And like, everybody was like laptops. Yeah. You know? Yeah. And, and here I am, I've got like my, my hardware, which I'm still controlling from numerology, but for some reason I said that numerology never failed me. Well, other things would <laugh> and that night, it was the 9 0 9, it was the nine oh nines midi <span style="color:red" data-ts="4953.135" data-end_ts="4953.335" title="4953.135" id=c_"4953.135">__sink__</span> that failed me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So I had to use the 9 0 9 as a midi clock master instead of a clock slave. So I, you know, I'm playing this gig and it's like, I'm not even, I just shut the laptop after about five minutes and, and built a set that was all hardware. And I'm looking at everybody else and, you know, it's like, you guys are just laptops now. Like, that's cool. You can go on an airplane, I guess. Like, that's cool. You know, I don't, I guess if you're into airplanes, I'm not. I drive everywhere, you know, it's like hardware. I knew that like hardware was gonna come back. I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Have to say, I was, I was lured in by the, siren song of the laptop. It was the laptop that was like, oh man, you know? Because one of the issues that I had was I had a massive amount of hardware, you know, just on the edge before it was ridiculous to buy old analog stuff. I had the opportunity to buy a bunch of it. I, I was not great at electronics at the time. I barely knew which end of a soldering iron got hot. And so I would get this old gear, but first of all, a bunch of it I bought off of this total zero in San Francisco named <span style="color:red" data-ts="5022.105" data-end_ts="5022.325" title="5022.105" id=c_"5022.105">__the__</span> Longo, who would sell everybody broken gear. It was pretty much sweat. Right. <laugh>. But secondly Yeah, I remember. Yeah. And, and secondly, there was just a lot of gear that would break all the time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And so I just felt like after a while I got really tired of this idea that, you know, everything, you know, at any given point in time, 25% of my studio was non-operational. Right. And that really, that was another one. Those things kind of got under my skin. And so the laptop, you know, a plugin never breaks hardly <laugh>. And when it does, you don't know. Yeah. You can't do anything but reboot the machine anyway, so it seemed, it seemed at the time cleaned. But, what I noticed was that my, the, the quantity and quality of the music I was making went directly downhill at that point. There was something about working with hardware that gave me the freedom to do things and record 'em that obsessing by looking at the laptop never did. And it was, it was something, it took me a long time to realize that that was the issue at play. And you know, luckily for me now, a lot of the things I like in hardware boutique manufacturers or even some people like Roland and Cork are making things that sort of have the, the heart and, some of the ghosts of some of that old equipment I had, but are in a new form factor and, and built in a way that it's probably not, I don't have to worry about my studio being half broken all the time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>Yeah. And also, like, I, I'd point out like, you know, I think that <span style="color:red" data-ts="5118.795" data-end_ts="5119.085" title="5118.795" id=c_"5118.795">__Corg__</span> is gonna keep on making Odyssey and Ms. Twenties until, I guess I could see a future where, where they don't make them, but like your mayor's name is Master Blaster and 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Not 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>Really looking forward to that future. Like, I just don't see it as being very likely. Right. You know, when we're all, we're all like, we're all driving around in, in, desert rods and dune buggies and wearing bondage gear. Like Yeah. Like Cory will probably not be making Odyssey <span style="color:red" data-ts="5147.685" data-end_ts="5147.845" title="5147.685" id=c_"5147.685">__in__</span> Ms. Twenties at that point, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And we'll, we'll be worried about doing stuff more than 12 inch dance. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>Yeah. You're not gonna be worried too much about making hot dance singles. Like when, when, when you, when you gotta worry about surviving beyond Thunderdome. Right. It's a, it's a nice time. We're in the, we're in the golden period. I mean the, the keyboard market is finally where the guitar market was in the nineties, is the way that I like to put it. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, the guitar market got to where it was in the nineties and it's pretty much stayed there since then. Right. You know, guitar products have had a little, there has actually been a loss in market share in the guitar market of the overall mi market. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> like the percentage that like guitar products have, it has gone down over the past five years. But it's not gonna go away. No. It's always gonna be there. Right. It'll always be very strong. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>I'll probably always be stronger than keyboards. Right. But this isn't a fad, this is a stabilization, this is a cultural stabilization that we're living through that's being caused by the death of monoculture. Okay. So like, we're no longer in a period where like the record company says dance, you know, and you say like, how high? Okay. That just doesn't, it's no longer the case. You don't go buy the new Cherry Pop and Daddy single just because like the record company is like paid enough fucking record stations or radio stations to play the tune and convince you that it's the number one hit single in the country right now. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, we choose our own art now it's things have become fractionalized. I see a lot of people on social media whining about it sometimes, but I don't really care. I'll take this any day. Any day I'll take the situation we have now over the situation that we had in the nineties. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. I totally agree. Alright, well man, we've, <span style="color:red" data-ts="5252.685" data-end_ts="5253.005" title="5252.685" id=c_"5252.685">__burnt__</span> through a lot of time. I really appreciate you, Ty, taking time outta your schedule to talk to me and Fantastic. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>I hope people listened. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, I'm sure they will. I still feel like I have still a half a million questions. I wanted to talk about <span style="color:red" data-ts="5266.345" data-end_ts="5266.565" title="5266.345" id=c_"5266.345">__Nab__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="5266.565" data-end_ts="5266.765" title="5266.565" id=c_"5266.565">__Con__</span>. I wanted to talk more about the Hammond. I wanted to talk more about what your NAMM experience was, but that'll have to wait for another time. But what I like asking when I, when I see somebody who's got a wide range of, of gear and stuff like that, I don't like to be too gear focused, but I do like finding out a little bit about favorites of all your instruments and all the stuff you work with. What's your favorite thing? The favorite thing that you don't make? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>The the Hammond and the, the, the a b three and a Leslie 31 H and a Leslie 1 22 all running at once. It 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Still does it for <span style="color:red" data-ts="5306.725" data-end_ts="5306.885" title="5306.725" id=c_"5306.725">__it's__</span> the best in the world. Yeah. Interesting. Oh 
</p>

<p>
<b>Suit & Tie Guy: </b>Yeah. Yeah. That's <span style="color:red" data-ts="5310.005" data-end_ts="5310.085" title="5310.005" id=c_"5310.005">__cool__</span>. Yeah, I don't like, I like building synthesizers, but I would be just as happy playing four nights a week in a supper club in the south end of Peoria in 1968. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. That's awesome. Well, so thank you so much. I hope that thank you take the opportunity to go out, take a look at, at the work that you've been doing both musically as well as with making your gear. And, with that I'm gonna say goodbye for you tonight. See you later. Cool. Thank you Darwin Alright, thank you. Bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Many thanks to suit for the very interesting and frankly opinionated, chat. I always like it when people come to the deck with a reason to talk. A couple of quick things. First of all, thanks again for your support for continuing to help me out with this podcast by listening and keeping my numbers up. Also, I want to let you know that if you are interested in modular synthesizers and learning more about them, feel free to drop an email to the email address book zero, that's B-O-O-K-Z-E-R o@twentyobjects.com. And, you can get a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data">PD</a>F copy of the first book of my series. It's called Book Zero, the four, for primary patches <span style="color:red" data-ts="5396.555" data-end_ts="5396.775" title="5396.555" id=c_"5396.555">__of__</span> modular syn, something like that. But, it's really interesting way to look at modular synthesis. So if you're into it, check that out. Otherwise, I'll check you next week. See you later. Bye.
