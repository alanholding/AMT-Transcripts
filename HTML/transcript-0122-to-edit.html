<b>Darwin: </b>All right. This week I am pleased to introduce yourself and to get to know for myself, somebody that was introduced to me by my friend Gregory Taylor. His name's Jay Anthony Allen. We're gonna call him Jay. And he is, well, I'll just let him explain yourself. So I'll just, I'll just kick off with Hi Jay. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>J. Anthony Allen: </b>Good, how are you? Good to be here. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright. Yeah, thanks a lot for, joining us in <span style="color:red" data-ts="35.285" data-end_ts="35.445" title="35.285" id=c_"35.285">__the__</span> podcast. Rather than me trying to explain, what you do and, and, and, who you are, why don't I let you do that? So give us a little overview on what, what your work looks like. 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>Well, I do a lot of different kinds of things lately. My background in a nutshell is, in composition. So I'm a, I do a lot of music writing for different things. I'm also, I started this, my own little school. So I teach, music composition at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota. And, but I also started my own little school called Slam Academy, where we teach more. I don't know. The, the term that gets used a lot is commercial music, which I don't really like, but more popular styles of music. We in electronic music, so we teach DJing production, sound design, a lot of Ableton live, that kind of stuff. I also do a lot of freelance just online teaching on my own, and through Slam Academy, but also just on my own. And the, I guess last thing that's a major part of my plate right now is I have this other company that I'm involved in called Ion Concert Media that does a lot of, developing new ways for concert music to use video and live performances. Interesting. On kind of the orchestra kind of scale. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Wow. Interesting. That's, you sound like you have a full plate. 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>Yeah, I like to keep busy. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. I hear that. That's cool. So, one of the things I like doing in my podcast is talking to, talking to people about how they got where they are. And I find it especially interesting with educators to find out what is it in your background that not only gave you the skills to be able to, you know, to be skilled enough at something to, to be able to teach it, but also sort of the, the passion necessary to be a, an effective educator. What'd your background look like and how'd you get to be the, the artist slash educator that you are? 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>Well, I think when it comes to being an educator, I could really narrow it down to the people that were really inspiring me. I think that probably goes for both as an artist and an educator. You know, the music I write is like, most artists is influenced by the people that have inspired me as composers or producers or artists. But also I think I got into teaching because I had some very exceptional and inspiring teachers that while I was taking either lessons or classes or whatever with them, I kind of saw myself as, you know, becoming, getting into the shoes that they're in and thinking, you know, that's the kind of job I want, but also kind of the person I wanna be in a way. So I think that's how I got into education is I had a couple teachers, kind of, a lot of teachers actually along the way. I was very lucky in the teachers I had, that were just really inspiring. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So where were some of these teachers located? Are we talking like junior high in high school, or are we talking in university? Where, where did you find the people that, I mean, 'cause what you're talking about is you found people that whose lives you wanted to model, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>Kind of. Yeah. Yeah. At least for starters. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Where did you find them? 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>I can think of a few high school teachers, two in particular that were particularly inspiring. One, especially my music teacher in high school, obviously. But even in those cases, I don't think either of them. I think I was probably too young to say, I want to be a teacher. Right? 'cause you are a good teacher. But my music teacher definitely inspired me to be, become a musician and take music seriously. Also, I would actually point to the guy, I took guitar lessons from when I was, you know, in eighth grade. You know, he was an inspiring guy. He was like a kind of a eighties rocker dude, but, you know, to a 14-year-old or whatever I was then, you know, that was, that was someone I really looked up to and I wanted to practice a lot and, you know, be just like him. Luckily I'm not an eighties <span style="color:red" data-ts="299.895" data-end_ts="300.135" title="299.895" id=c_"299.895">__walker__</span> <laugh>. That never panned out for me. But, but mostly I would say in college, when I was an undergrad, I had some really excellent music teachers that were hard but inspiring. You know, they were hard teachers, but they, they were good at cracking the whip and getting me to do that. I did my undergrad at Grand Valley State University. It's a liberal arts college in Michigan where I grew up. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>And then I went, I did grad school at Peabody Conservatory and then at the University of Minnesota. And in both those places I had some, some teachers that I found to be really inspiring and some that weren't, to be honest. Which is, I think actually also maybe one of the things that drove me, not drove me, but influenced the way I teach definitely is the bad teachers I had. Right. The teachers that I didn't think were very good and I, I picked up the things that they did that I thought were not effective. And I've, you know, incorporated that into my teaching to be sure I don't do that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. The, the concept of anti-patterns, right? Yes, 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>Exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That's cool. So your music education in college, what did you, what was actually your area of study? 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>When I was an undergrad, my, I have a bachelor's in music, with guitar performance. So classical guitar basically. Yeah. And then my master's at Peabody, I did a master's in composition. And then I also did a master's at Peabody in electronic music. They have a, a pretty cool electronic music program, which you can get a master's in, specifically electronic music. And then at the University of Minnesota, <span style="color:red" data-ts="403.615" data-end_ts="403.815" title="403.615" id=c_"403.615">__it__</span> was a PhD in composition. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I didn't realize that Peabody had a electronic music, master's degree. What, what kind of things did you, what, what did that look like? I'm, I'm curious. 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>You know, it's, it's a program that's been around for a long time. Actually, it was one of the early, not the earliest, obviously. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, but one of the earlier electronic music programs at a conservatory there, they have a couple studios. It was a lot of, it was a lot of max, it was a lot of synthesis programming, a lot of, a good amount of code, if you know, chiro fuga. Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="442.235" data-end_ts="442.455" title="442.235" id=c_"442.235">__Is__</span> that name ring a bell? Yeah, he's, he's now at McGill. He was there when I was there. Oh, he was at, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, interesting. Okay. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>And, McGregor Boyle is the more composition teacher who's there uhhuh in the electronic music side. So it was, it was a good environment. It was a smaller studio. They had, and I don't know if they still do it this way, but they had kind of this three track thing where you could do electronic music performance was a master's and electronic music composition, which is what I did. And then I think the third one was a research focus thing. So I was doing obviously the composition route, but Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So what is it about composition that caught your fancy? Because, you know, you started off being influenced by guitarist and I mean, that's, that's sort of my story. I had a, you had a eighties rocker. I had a seventies folk rocker. Right. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But nevertheless, you know, you, you get influenced by, you know, to be a guitar kind of performance person, and then at some point you decide to take a, take a turn, and now you're more focused on composition than playing. What, what was the thing that, that brought you there? What was the thing that took you there? 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>You know, I can't pinpoint a moment, but I could say that, you know, when I was in college, well, actually before I was even in college, I was, I was doing composition, you know, like, like a lot of, you know, I see a lot of my students now come into college having written, you know, two symphonies and doing like the, the, the thing where they write the biggest thing they can imagine, imagine as a really young, young kid. So I, you know, I was foolishly doing that, like a lot of kids <laugh>. And I, I had written in high school, I was, you know, I was playing jazz and stuff, and I had written a couple jazz charts for me and my friends that I, in hindsight, I'm sure they were no good, but they were fun. And so I was really into composition ever since I was younger. 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>And I'm not exactly sure what, where I got the, the bug to do it, other than I, I just felt like it was something that people did. Right. So like, there were people that wrote music, and as soon as I kind of learned that I wanted to try to try to write some and see if I could do it. And then in, in college, we didn't have a composition major where I was at the time. I don't know if they do now, but we didn't have a composition major. So the guitar performance was a bit of a secondary thing. I was taking composition lessons and we had composition teachers. There was just no major. And I had some really excellent composition teachers actually. So I did a composition recital and, and everything. But it wasn't a degree. And I think maybe one of the things was when I was in college, there was, I was playing in a rock band, you know, a college rock band, and we were doing pretty good. 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>We were playing a lot of shows and doing some Midwest stuff, but at some point there was just kind of a artistic on <span style="color:red" data-ts="632.765" data-end_ts="632.985" title="632.765" id=c_"632.765">__we__</span> of the music. I was playing <laugh>, that's a weird phrase I don't think I've ever said before. But, <laugh>, I was, I was just kind of bored and wanted, wanted, I, I, you know, I liked playing in rock bands. It was fun, but there was something that I just, I just needed to do something more musical, I think, or something like that. And, and then, you know, that was shortly before I shipped off for grad school. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's really interesting you say it that way because, I know for my, for myself, there was a point, this idea of sort of like a, a musical en <span style="color:red" data-ts="670.975" data-end_ts="671.195" title="670.975" id=c_"670.975">__we__</span> really rings a bell for me because for me, I was like, I was trying to write like alt pop talk talk songs and stuff like that, right? And then all of a sudden one day I was like, I'm done. I'm done with it. I don't ever want to hear it nor do it ever again. And I just like, sort of like packed up my pencils and paper and just went a different way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>You know? I got that way with the guitar, the entire instrument, guitar <laugh>. Yeah. No, I'm serious. I, there was probably about two or three years where I didn't wanna hear any music with a guitar. I didn't wanna pick one up. I was just sick of it. It was just, I was just tired of hearing the guitar and like, all this music, and I just thought, why can't we be more creative than putting guitar even in pop songs? Like, there are, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So I know slapping it on everything. Right. Yeah, I hear you. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>So I, I, I didn't wanna have anything to do with it, and I was, I think probably a bit of a snob about it. But that was after I had kind of fallen in love with all the electronic stuff which came, you know, so I was in, I was into composition and everything, but really in kind of the chamber music setting. And then at some point I got turned onto a couple albums where I was like, you know, that's it, you know, electronic is is where it's at. And then I kind of leveled off in doing some of both, but 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So what, what were those albums? 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>There were two and there with this, I can't think of this specific thing that happened, these, these two albums that I picked up that I just thought, oh my God, that's just, I could never do anything like that. It was just really mind blowing. One of them, and I think I picked them up in like the same run to the music store. There was this one day I picked up these two albums. One of them was, I Care because You Do 'cause <span style="color:red" data-ts="784.345" data-end_ts="784.425" title="784.345" id=c_"784.345">__the__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="784.485" data-end_ts="784.705" title="784.485" id=c_"784.485">__aec__</span>, apex Twin Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And the other one is one that I still <span style="color:red" data-ts="791.545" data-end_ts="791.825" title="791.545" id=c_"791.545">__love__</span>. I still love that Apex Twin album, but this other one I still listen to all the time. And whenever I tell people that this is one of the albums that really inspired me to do electronic music, I tend to get laughed at because it's not a celebrated album. Yeah. I don't know why. I think it's brilliant. It's, the seduction of Claude Debussy by The Art of Noise. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Well that's not as embarrassing as mine, but I'll let you have it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>Well, what's, what's yours? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Mine, the, the thing that actually got me excited about just, somebody gave me, boss Drum by the Shaman <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b><laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And, you know, and now people are like, what? And I'm like, sorry. It just, it was so different from anything. And I think that's what some of this stuff is. The electronic stuff is, and certainly Apex Twin was one that did it for me too, but there's something about this thing that it's like, it's so different Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> that it kind of shakes you awake. 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>Right? <span style="color:red" data-ts="859.975" data-end_ts="860.265" title="859.975" id=c_"859.975">__Yeah__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And I think that that's useful. And Art of Noise is actually, that's a, that's a actually a really good take because they sort of like messed with a lot of different artistic, artistic concepts in, with the musical concepts and technological concepts. And that's pretty, that's pretty interesting. And it actually, they're, they're kind of an interesting play because it seems like a lot of the stuff you talk about teaching now has a real heart in the kind of stuff that they were doing. They're doing really creative sampling, you know, just kind of pushing envelopes that no one even considered being musical at the time. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>The reaction I tend to get when I tell people that is, you know, the Art of Noise makes a lot of sense that you would say that, but not that album. Not 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, I hear that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>But I, I love that album. I just think it's gorgeous. It's a bit dated, but not as much as it should be. Right. For how old it is. And just, I think it's the first album that I heard that was both blended acoustic and electronic elements. And I could listen to it as though it was a multi movement work. You know, the entire album. I, it was like really kinda locked in that, like, this is like a multi movement chamber piece essentially, which I never listened to, you know, commercial music in that way before. And it just made me think, oh, I could actually do this kind of stuff. And that's, you know, it's okay to think that way. I don't know. It was, I still love that album and I'm, and I'm not gonna be ashamed of <span style="color:red" data-ts="957.255" data-end_ts="957.375" title="957.255" id=c_"957.255">__it__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="957.375" data-end_ts="957.575" title="957.375" id=c_"957.375">__anymore__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Well, and especially now when you can point to me in my frigging shame and obsession. That's 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>True. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>There's that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>I'm not as bad as Darwin 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Not as bad as Darwin <span style="color:red" data-ts="967.295" data-end_ts="967.535" title="967.295" id=c_"967.295">__Gross__</span>. Right. Let's talk, some about the teaching that you do now. So, first of all, what is it that you teach at St. Taos? 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>I teach composition, music technology. They have a recording arts program, so I teach recording, and some production, but it's mostly recording and, some of the music theory curriculum. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Got it. So that's, that's really interesting. But that's sort of like, a lot of that is really classical university music instruction. Yep. And you're balancing that with Slam Academy. 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Which is, so first of all, is <span style="color:red" data-ts="1008.655" data-end_ts="1008.775" title="1008.655" id=c_"1008.655">__a__</span> teaching load not enough for you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>Well, or 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Is it that you really have a, have a handker to also do education in these more modern techniques? 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>I like the, I like the modern techniques and I just kind of like everything about Slam Academy, but I kind of also like having one foot in the traditional. I mean, I, I think that statement is true both in my career choices and musical choices, <laugh> in ways, you know, I like being part of the, you know, the normal university system somewhat. But also doing this, you know, thing where we're teaching people how to DJ and make beats and things like that. So, it's not that hard to split my time that way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Do you see much overlap between the two? I mean, even like in the music technology, I would think that the kinds of things you're teaching in university isn't really the same thing as you're likely to be teaching at Slam Academy. 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>More and more I do actually see overlap. Oh, really? Yeah. I kind of equate it to, you know, at some point, at some point the, the academy, you know, the universities and such was started to take jazz seriously as something to be studied. Right. And I think, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1089.605" data-end_ts="1089.825" title="1089.605" id=c_"1089.605">__it__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1089.825" data-end_ts="1089.905" title="1089.825" id=c_"1089.825">__was__</span>, it was, embarrassingly late in the game that that happened, but, I'm starting to see that a little bit in academia. I think when with electronic music, I mean, I can talk in a music theory class about Apex Twin and not get reprimanded by the dean. Right. You know, like, it's kind of okay now. And, and I have students that come to me where for private lessons in composition, and that's fine, but some students come to me for private lessons in laptop performance and it gets written off on, on, on, the paperwork for the university. 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>It's, it's a composition lesson, but everyone knows that it's, it's a laptop thing. That's what we're doing. And that's okay. I do now at the university have a, you can sign up for lessons under the kind of course name of composition lessons or something else. And I, it's weird, but I think it's, I think it's something like electronic music production. It's weird than that. But that's basically, so students come to me at, at university to take lessons in, you know, like synthesis and making beats and stuff like that. And, and that's okay. It's not gonna be a required class for anything, but as an elective they can do it. And it's, it's allowed. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>So there's some overlap, growing, I think, out of that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And what do you see as sort of the bleeding edge? So I, I assume you would see this either through your private lessons or your work at Slam Academy. What are the things that students are drawing you towards and saying, I gotta know more about this? 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>Hmm. . That's a good question. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Or do they come to you expecting you're gonna tell them? 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>No, well, there's, there's some of that, but it's much more interesting when they're telling me what's cool. What I'm mostly looking for, when students are telling me what they're into is, is artists, you know, because, so that I can keep up with, with what, I actually keep a list of every band or artist that a student mentions. And so whenever I have time, I just work through my list listening to whatever they're giving me. But, you know, there's a lot of students that are coming to me because they hear, you know, probably more than not at the university, they hear through the grapevine that, that there's an Ableton guy, <laugh>, there's an Ableton guy somewhere on the university <laugh>. So you should take lessons with him. So I get a lot of people that come to me specifically with, you know, wanting to know Ableton better or with just Ableton questions. 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>Right. And that's cool. And I like that. So I think that's probably a lot of what they're coming with is, is Ableton. And then, you know, a lot of the sounds I'm hearing out of my students is that kind of, that kind of new funk thing that's happening. I'm hearing a lot of that coming outta students, which is fun. I dig it. And it requires a sufficient dose of music theory to really get Right. Right. So that a lot can I, can, I can, you know, talk about harmony quite a bit with that, which is fun for me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Yeah. That's not something that comes up in like g Techno or anything. <laugh>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1302.225" data-end_ts="1302.445" title="1302.225" id=c_"1302.225">__No__</span>. Tell me a little bit about your approach of teaching something like Ableton, because I, I'm curious. I, I teach Ableton <span style="color:red" data-ts="1310.125" data-end_ts="1310.325" title="1310.125" id=c_"1310.125">__at__</span>, in one of my classes, I teach in a, in an art department, which is kind of unique. And so teaching sound design and sound art and, and Ableton in that environment is kind of different than in a music music <span style="color:red" data-ts="1323.605" data-end_ts="1324.045" title="1323.605" id=c_"1323.605">__focused__</span> environment. 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So I'm curious to hear what is, what is the approach you take, first of all, can you assume that they understand harmony and scales and all that kind of stuff sufficiently? Or do you have to teach at at that level? 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>Sometimes it's kind of 50 50. If a music major is coming to me, then I can assume that, but a lot of students are just getting that word of mouth thing. I see. And I can't assume it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see. 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>For me it has to do with less about if, if I'm just getting someone started on Ableton, if they're a music major, the big analogy I can use is the score. Not so much harmony, but the, you know, left to right reading of the score. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And we can easily start on arrangement view and they can understand that pretty quick. And then we can move 'em over to session and all that stuff. If, if they don't understand like how a score works, 'cause in score, they'd also understand tracks as staves and all this other, this, this analogy works in many ways. Right? Yeah. But if they don't understand that then, and if they just wanna dj, then we don't start with arrangement view at all. You know, we start with session view and we just kind of rock out for a while. So, yeah. I can't really assume either, you know, who, what the background is that they're coming to me at, at the university. I can a little bit better at Slam, I can assume their background that, that they don't have a background reading music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. They're enthusiastic about music, but not necessarily knowledgeable about theory. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Even theory, you know, we have students that come in all the time that are making awesome music and don't know anything about theory and that's just fine. Theory isn't required at Slam Academy. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> at all, really. It's an option though that we offer. But the way I teach Ableton is pretty much no matter who's coming to me, I do it. The, the approach I take is we are going to learn how to think like a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1446.775" data-end_ts="1446.995" title="1446.775" id=c_"1446.775">__DA__</span> is the idea. I don't like to just teach Ableton. I like to teach, you know, how, you know, multi-track software works. I use Ableton for example, all the time 'cause that's my bag, but sometimes I jump between, so in my teaching studio at St. Thomas, I have, Ableton Logic and Pro Tools. So sometimes I'll teach a concept and bounce between the three just so that they can see Okay. You know, buttons are labeled different things, but you know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Concepts are the same for 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>Me. Concepts are the same. Yeah. So I like to teach students how to learn the new software so that they're always in shape when, you know, a new update comes and they can, or a new piece of software comes and they can figure it out because they understand how the thing works, you know, at the core level. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Now I'm curious about one thing. So I know Slam Academy, when, when you guys first started, it was really sort of like production and DJing, right? <span style="color:red" data-ts="1511.665" data-end_ts="1511.955" title="1511.665" id=c_"1511.665">__Yeah__</span>. But it seems like more and more DJing is kind of becoming like an extended technique of production and not actually a thing of its own. 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>Yeah. I think that's probably true. The way we do it is we have our, our kind of big meaty programs where we really get into everything. And those are centered on, we have kind of two separate like tracks of those. One is, like a production program focused around Ableton, but it's a, you know, producing stuff, making music stuff. Right. And then we have another one that's, a sound design one, which is kind of like an advanced version of the first one. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, it's more synthesis, more, you know, down in the trenches kind of stuff. And then we have the, our a DJ program, which is a shorter program that works well with the Ableton program. So all that really is to say is that we don't spend a lot of time on during the production course on how to read the audience, you know, do these DJ specific things. But you're right, I mean, in the production class, a lot of the time they are preparing tracks to be performed from some kind of DJ setup 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Now, do you, do you teach vinyl at all or is everything off of, I mean, for DJing, do you teach vinyl at all or is everything off of digital now? 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>No, we do some vinyl stuff. You do? Yep. I don't actually teach the DJ in class, but the guy who does is a awesome DJ in town named Leon Jay. He teaches most of the DJ class, and he starts the, the class, I think the first two weeks I think are vinyl. Ah, okay. Not expecting students to adopt vinyl or master, you know, beat matching on vinyl or anything like that, but to use it as kind of the template to understand how some of the more modern tools work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>So, but we do have a set of tables set up and kids come in all the time and just wanna rock out on vinyl. So it's fun. That's cool. I like doing it too. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Do you keep like a crate of great, yeah. A great vinyl for people to mess with? 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>Yeah. We have a few crates, <laugh>. Okay. Mess around it. That's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Cool. So now you talk about, a little bit about performance for yourself. What, what do, what do your performances look like? 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>Well, right now I'm kind of on a little bit of a hiatus with performing. I haven't done a lot of performing in a while. I did a big thing, for many years, kind of my, my, my bag was this like a, a data glove thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>Yeah. So I was doing, see, it's funny because when I say that to you, you're like, okay. But other people are like, that's just the weirdest thing in the world. I've never heard of that. It's funny. But yeah, I was doing a data glove thing for a long time. I did a lot of shows <span style="color:red" data-ts="1696.765" data-end_ts="1696.965" title="1696.765" id=c_"1696.765">__in__</span> that I even played in like a rock band doing the data glove thing, a couple years ago for a little while. But I kinda got tired of it. It was a lot of stress, you know, it was a lot of, you know, programming and hardware <span style="color:red" data-ts="1710.285" data-end_ts="1710.565" title="1710.285" id=c_"1710.285">__keep__</span> upkeep and I just didn't feel flexible enough on them. So I kind of put that aside for a while just to focus on writing and I'm starting to think about performing again. I've done a couple laptop performances with APCs similar, you know, APCs launchpads and similar stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>But I'm starting to think about a performance again. I actually just bought, like a month ago, bought a new electric guitar, which I haven't bought an electric guitar in 15 years. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1744.315" data-end_ts="1744.515" title="1744.315" id=c_"1744.315">__It__</span> was the last time I bought an electric guitar, and I still have it. It's a great, you know, it's a Strat, it's a great guitar. I just bought a crazy, 10 string guitar and devised a weird tuning method for it. I'm not exactly sure why. I think I want, I want to, I want to have it in a, in a set somehow, but I don't wanna like just play guitar. I wanted to do something weirder. And so I kind of had these ideas for playing guitar in this very different kind of way. So I found this, you know, kind of custom shop that would make this this thing that I wanted. And it's incredibly difficult to play. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Was some of it that you were trying to get out of like the licks and stuff that you would naturally play when you'd pick up the instrument? 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>Yes, absolutely. That is a huge part of it. Yeah. That's why I tuned it different. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>And, went for something that was more than six strings and Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1799.745" data-end_ts="1799.965" title="1799.745" id=c_"1799.745">__And__</span>, a lot of it was thinking about the jazz, the jazz stuff that I've been into for a long time. I'm, I'm still into, into some of the jazz guitar players, particularly the people that are a little out of the box. Like Charlie Hunter is this guy. Do you know him? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I've heard of him. I heard of him from, actually another person I did an interview with, they were, they were pointing at him as, as an amazing cat. 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>He does this like eight string guitar thing. That's really cool. And even without the eight strings, just his, his choice of, of notes. I'm sure if he was even on a six string, it would be really interesting playing. But he does this cool kind of eight string thing, and I've always kind of been into that, so I thought I'd take a stab at it. It's gonna be a long time before I go any <laugh>, this crazy tennis <span style="color:red" data-ts="1848.085" data-end_ts="1848.325" title="1848.085" id=c_"1848.085">__string__</span> guitar. But, I try to devote some time to practicing it every day and we'll see where it goes. Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So you're based out of Minneapolis, which is Yeah. It's soon to be my home, or I will really still be moving that. Yeah. I'm gonna be moving, I, June 1st. I'm gonna be moving up in that area. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>Oh, we'll have to get you down to do some stuff at <span style="color:red" data-ts="1870.525" data-end_ts="1870.725" title="1870.525" id=c_"1870.525">__Islam__</span> Academy then. I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Think that'd be fun. That'd be a hoot. If nothing else, just to see what you guys are doing, that'll be great. But, tell me a little bit, so I'm, I'm obviously curious, what is the, what's the scene like for music in, in Minneapolis right now? What kind of things seem to be, exciting, exciting things to do, or exciting things to see? Because I, for me, Minneapolis will always hold a really special spot because, I loved doing the Spark Festival. Yeah. Whether I was playing or whether I was visiting. I just loved it. And I, I really missed that festival, frankly. Well, you were actually involved in it, I understand, 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>Right? Yeah. I was kind of the number two mm-Hmm. <affirmative> of the Spark Festival. So it was, spark was, started by Doug <span style="color:red" data-ts="1920.405" data-end_ts="1920.685" title="1920.405" id=c_"1920.405">__years__</span>, who was my teacher at the U so at the University of Minnesota. So he <span style="color:red" data-ts="1926.265" data-end_ts="1926.485" title="1926.265" id=c_"1926.265">__st__</span> I believe he started it. And then the first year it was, you know, kind of a small, it was a really small thing. And then the second year is when I showed up, and then the third year is when I was like, actively involved helping Doug. And then, yeah. And then, and then we, we kind of built it up into a, a, a big awesome thing, but it 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Was amazing. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>The Spark Festival is gone, but if you, if you trace the lineage of the Spark Festival and went from the people involved with Spark and the, the goals of Spark, that we were trying to have, which was really community focused, really like getting awesome people together to make music, talk about music and all of that. What happened to Spark after it ended still exists because you can trace the lineage of Spark to, slam Academy. Right. Slam Academy is the modern implementation of the Spark Festival, as far as I'm concerned. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1993.565" data-end_ts="1993.685" title="1993.565" id=c_"1993.565">__Well__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1993.685" data-end_ts="1993.925" title="1993.685" id=c_"1993.685">__Sort__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1993.925" data-end_ts="1994.005" title="1993.925" id=c_"1993.925">__of__</span>, you and JP were both really 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Jp Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>JP did all of the, the nightlife stuff. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I remember that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>He was, which was some of the craziest stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's hilarious fun. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>And the idea of, you know, community and putting people together to make the same thing happen. It's still how we run Slam Academy is still under that exact same philosophy. So we really see Slam Academy as the modern, well, not the modern, but the, the current implementation of the Spark Festival. You know, interesting. We don't have our own festival yet. Right. But maybe someday we will 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. So what, what other stuff is happening in town right now? What's, what seems to be hot? What's, what's going on in Minneapolis that, that I need to, I need to make sure I'm aware of. 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>Well, how do you feel about Prince? He's a big deal here. You know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, so I've heard <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>Well, there's, there's a lot of cool stuff. I mean, I love the scene here. I mean, I, when I moved here to go to school, I had no intention of staying, but Right. I kind of fell in love with the city. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That seems to happen a lot. I've met a lot of people. That's, that's one of the things when we were looking at moving and, you know, moving back to the Midwest, I was like, so often I've run into people either who never meant to stay in Minneapolis and did, or had to leave Minneapolis and miss it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Except for the cold 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b><laugh>. Well, yeah. It's cold. I mean, but you know, everyone's gonna tell you that, but it takes you, you know, a month to get over it. Right. You know, then you're like, okay, yeah, it's cold. You know, like, I gotta, I gotta get warmer <laugh>. It's not, you know, it's not gonna kill you. Right. Unless, unless, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Unless it does <laugh>. Unless it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2104.525" data-end_ts="2104.685" title="2104.525" id=c_"2104.525">__us__</span>. Unless 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>You're really into, like, running around the streets naked in January, then you might, you might regret that. But, now I think the thing for, for me, and for a lot of people like me that is so attractive about Minneapolis is in general the support for the arts here. And it's not just, you know, the galleries and the venues, although there's a lot of those, there's a lot of people making art here, but there's also just this incredible support for it. There are, there's a lot of foundations that are helping artists in terms of money mostly. So, you know, there's, there's opportunities to find some money for projects. There's a lot of opportunities to find money for projects. We have this incredible, state sponsored grant program, that gives a lot of tax dollars to artists. That's, one of the biggest things that's happened in the last couple years. We have state arts board. There's a lot of nonprofits doing stuff. So there's, there's just an incredible amount of support for the artist community in all arts and music. And, you know, in music, it's the home of the American Composer's Forum in, it's one of the biggest, i I, there's some statistic that people say about theater. Like it's the most theaters of any city in the United States per capita, aside from New York. Oh, wow. There's something like that. I mean, there's a lot of theaters. That's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>It's just a good community. And, you know, there's this weird thing where the, the spring in the art world, art and music world is like, you know, in the winter everyone kind of holds up and works on their new stuff. And then in the spring everybody comes out and they've got all this new, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>All this new stuff. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>Paintings there, new tracks there, new compositions <span style="color:red" data-ts="2213.725" data-end_ts="2213.845" title="2213.725" id=c_"2213.725">__there__</span>, new everything. So, everyone's kind of popping out being like, look at what I did over the last five months when no one knew <span style="color:red" data-ts="2220.445" data-end_ts="2220.565" title="2220.445" id=c_"2220.445">__what__</span> it was. Right. We used to say six months, but global warming we're down to five months. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I'm, I'm expecting that by the time I make it up there, it's gonna be just this side of a desert. So <span style="color:red" data-ts="2231.015" data-end_ts="2231.365" title="2231.015" id=c_"2231.015">__there__</span> we go. And what is, what is the community like in <span style="color:red" data-ts="2235.485" data-end_ts="2235.605" title="2235.485" id=c_"2235.485">__terms__</span>, 'cause one of the things that can happen when, when there is a fair amount of, money available, what sometimes you see is it gets, it gets a little bit parasitic where because there's a little bit of money available, people gravitate towards the money and then it starts becoming uncivil, right. Amongst artists. Do you see much of that? Or is it, is it pretty, pretty cool? 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>It's pretty cool. I have seen that there's a thing, there's a, there's a thing that I've noticed that can happen on occasion, amongst composers that I've, I call the composer Cold War, where on occasion you might apply for a, there's like one big composer grant happening and we all apply for it. And you don't talk about it. You don't talk about what you, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2288.965" data-end_ts="2289.125" title="2288.965" id=c_"2288.965">__you__</span> what, what your strategy was in your application this year and things like that. It doesn't happen too much, but sometimes there's a little bit of that. Like, did you apply? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I applied. Okay. Let's not talk about that <laugh>. But, in the most part, it's not a competitive scene. It's a, it's a supportive scene. It's a community. I haven't felt the kind of competitive that I've, competitiveness that I've felt in other scenes. Of course, I was a lot younger when I was in the other scenes, but, but no, that, that parasitic element doesn't creep in very much. At least not in my world. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's great. So then one last question for you before I let you go, which is, I mean, this is gonna be a total left turn from everything we've talked about to this point, but everything we've talked about to this point has been related to being a musician and an educator. But there's one other thing that it seems like you actually have to do is, is given the common <span style="color:red" data-ts="2349.465" data-end_ts="2349.885" title="2349.465" id=c_"2349.465">__nation__</span> of things you're doing, there's at least a certain element of businessmen that has to creep into it, right? Yep. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>How, how is that work? How does that fit into your, like, self image? Is it a necessary evil? Is it something that just came natural? Is it something you don't think about? Is it something you have someone else handle for you? How, how does that work? Because, you know, frankly, a lot of people would look at what you're doing saying, boy, that's a life I would like to live. I mean, you know, you talk about how people modeled for you, it seems like you're modeling a very contemporary version of what a composing artist would look like, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>Yeah. I mean, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But there is a business aspect to it. Yeah. How do you deal with that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>It's, it's a bit of a love hate relationship. There are parts of it I like, and there are parts of it. I don't, more and more I think I enjoy, I enjoy a lot of it. I enjoy a lot of the business stuff, and I get, there's like the part of my brain that gets excited when I like, have like a, a really good performance of like a string quartet. You know, like I feel this gratification, that same part of my brain kind of goes off when we hit some kind of milestone at Slam Academy or at one of my other companies. There's a certain artistic reward that I feel from doing that. So I don't think the business side of it is actually close. It's, it's kind of an art Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> in a way. And I don't know enough about business to explain that further other than I get a similar satisfaction out of the business side of it that I do from as an artist. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's very interesting and probably pretty useful. 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>Yeah. Well, I, if it, if that wasn't true, I'd be in a lot of trouble right now. But, you know, and there's parts of it that I really enjoy when, you know, we we're, we're building this thing, you know, like we're, and, and it's going well, you know, we're, we've, it, it feels successful and, and, and I, I get to work with these great kids and I, you know, the, the most rewarding thing is sitting in on the classes at Slam Academy that I'm not teaching. Like when one of my colleagues is teaching like j JP or Leon sitting in on one of their classes, just sitting in the back of the room and listening and just thinking like, this work, even like the bullshit that we have to do to keep this business going, like, this is why we're doing it. And I don't mean to sound all like warm fuzzy about it, but it does feel really good to be like, these kids are loving this class and, this teacher is having a great time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>They probably couldn't teach either this content or in this style at a traditional university. And they're all amazing teachers. So we see, you know, students are loving it. They're having a great time, they're learning so much. And, I just, I've, I've kind of made it a thing that at least once a month I have to sit through, one of their classes just to kind of get that back in my head that like, you know, this is why we do it. And it feels good. On the other hand, sometimes we have to let people go from the company, which is not something I enjoy. Yesterday we had to have a long talk about with our insurance agent about all the potential things that can go horribly, horribly wrong for us, <laugh> Yeah, I know. And how we need to be covered for these things. And it was miserable. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's like having the grim Reaper come visit. It 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>Is, it is. But I mean, those are the things you have to deal with, and that's okay. And so there are, there are good things and bad things, but on the whole, I, I enjoy it. I might say the opposite tomorrow, <laugh>, it kind of changes, but, but I, I like the business side of things sometimes. As long as I don't let myself get too, you know, as long as I don't let myself forget about the artist part of my life, I think that's when I start to hate the business stuff. Sure, sure. That makes sense. When it feels like that's all I am. Yeah. But as long as I keep writing music and, you know, putting stuff out, even though it's at a little bit slower pace because of all the other things I'm doing, I still kind of have to identify as an artist first, or else I'll get, I start to get really bogged down and kind of miserable about the business stuff. But if I don't do that and if I just pace myself well, then I, I, I generally enjoy the business stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That sounds great. It sounds like you have developed a really interesting and fun, fun gig man. Yeah. I'm really glad for you. That's awesome. Well, thanks again so much for your time. I really appreciate it. And, let's get together and, and talk soon, maybe when I'm up in your neck of the woods. 
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>Yeah, definitely. Let me know as soon as you get here. I'll be happy to show you around town. Maybe we'll zip out to Prince's house and take you over to Slam. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sounds like a deal, man. Alright, I'll catch you later. Bye.
</p>

<p>
<b>J.: </b>Thanks, man. See ya. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Hey, thanks to Jay for spending the time. I really appreciate it. It was a lot of fun and I'm looking forward to seeing him when I make my move up to Minneapolis. Thanks everyone for listening, for sharing with your friends, your enemies, your, most beloved and least beloved. Keep on listening and I'll catch you next time around. Bye.
