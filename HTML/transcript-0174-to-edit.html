<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today I have the great pleasure of getting to talk to somebody I've known for a while, but kind of in a cursory way, and this is gonna give us a chance to get to know each other a little better. His name is Doug Gears, and, I ran into him when I was at the Seamus Conference last weekend. He was the first person I met when I got there, and so it was, it was prescient. The, one of the first things I did was like, breathlessly say, can I interview for you, you for the podcast? And he was gracious enough to agree. So here we go. So let's say good morning to Doug. Hey, Doug. How's it going? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Doug Geers: </b>Oh, life is good. I have my coffee in hand and I'm, I'm pretty chill this morning, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. That's awesome. That's perfect. So, why don't we start off by, introducing you to the listeners by having you describe a little bit of what you do and what your current work is like. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Doug: </b>Okay. I am a composer of experimental electronic music. I studied, with Brad Garten, when he was at the Cincinnati Conservatory and then later at Columbia University. And, I am very interested these days in trying to find ways to create immersive experiences for audiences to combine music with other media, to build instruments and perform electronic music. So, but most of it is kind of on the strange and odd side, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, it's interesting because I had actually, even before I had met you at, at Seamus, I, I was talking to Gregory Taylor, my friend Gregory Taylor, and he was like, oh, you ought to talk to Doug. And, he kind of pointed out some of your work, but it was after we talked and I went on your website and I actually got a really good chance to kind of review some of, some of the work you've done. And you're like really pretty prolific too, <laugh>, you, you know, just the list of work that you've done in 2016, for example. You know, it's a pretty, pretty decent body of work and you're very active. This is all in the New York area generally. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Doug: </b>I love to travel 'cause I love meeting new people. Okay. But since the birth of my daughter in 2011, I've been a little bit more of a homebody and, have not traveled quite so much. So a lot of it these days is happening in the New York area. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That, that makes a lot of sense. Well, I would think, too, I'm gonna put up a note for the listeners to be able to, jump on your website and start checking out your work. Sure. But, one of the things I would imagine is being based outta New York, you actually have access to musicians who are not only able, but willing to play your work as well. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Doug: </b>Yeah. That's one of the, the beauties of the, the city is that it's a place where there are so many people who are so amazing at what they do. It's just, a wonderful thing to find people who you say, oh, I have this new piece, you know, the score is entirely pictures of famous mustaches, <laugh>, and, some drawings, would you play it? And they're like, yeah, sure. This is great. Which just happened this spring. So, you know, it's, it's a really fortunate place to be. Paying the rent every month is gonna be more difficult than if I lived in Iowa or Colorado. You know, that's the, the payback, you know. But as a daily experience, it, it's pretty fabulous. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Now, one of the ways, the way that I got to know you first was when you were based out of Minneapolis Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And you were involved in the creation and expansion of the Spark Festival. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Doug: </b>Right. Yeah. That, I mean, that was, I look back on those days as being just such a fabulous time. And, the people who worked to put that together and make it happen every year, I mean, it was a real labor of love. And, you know, from j Anthony Allen, JP Gelman, David Hill, <span style="color:red" data-ts="255.905" data-end_ts="256.325" title="255.905" id=c_"255.905">__Philip__</span> O'Toole, you know, just so many people, and, dozens of students over the years who came through, who were part of it. It was really a wonderful experience to be part of that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and a lot of those people, I've, I've interviewed some of them for the podcast, and I've just met others now that I'm in the area. And so many people talk about that as being sort of one of the highlights of their creative lives as well. So it was, it was something that you, you know, you you were involved in that was really, really a sparkler. I know for myself, it was one of my favorite, like festival things to go to. I I looked forward to it every year, and I always, you know, sometimes I got the chance to perform, but I was al I always seemed to get the chance to be inspired in ways that I hadn't expected. So that was, that was a really neat thing. How hard was it for you to leave, leave that behind? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Doug: </b>It was difficult. I mean, there was the allure of being in the big city, and I'm now, based at, Brooklyn College, which is one of the campuses of the city, university of New York. And that was, the Center for Computer Music here was founded by a composer named Charles Dodge in 1978. Right. Had a real historical place, especially in the eighties in computer music. Yeah. But the Twin Cities are really a fabulous place on this planet, and the people there and the support there. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="342.065" data-end_ts="342.285" title="342.065" id=c_"342.065">__as__</span>, at least in the time when I was there, the amazing convergence of cool, open-minded people and the ability to make things happen was just mind blowing. The first year I did spark, I, I just thought, I wanna make something happen, you know? And so I had just a little bit of money from being hired. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Doug: </b>They give you a little bit of money to help make things happen sometimes. And so I brought in Paul Lansky, a composer who you've probably heard of. Yes. <span style="color:red" data-ts="369.465" data-end_ts="369.685" title="369.465" id=c_"369.465">__He__</span> used to teach at Princeton, and this drummer named Greg Beyer, who now teaches, I think in Wisconsin or Illinois. And, but Greg had written a book called How Learn to Play Drums with Metallica <laugh>. So I made this poster where I said, like, Paul <span style="color:red" data-ts="383.215" data-end_ts="383.565" title="383.215" id=c_"383.215">__Lasky__</span> sampled by Radiohead, you know, like in Six Inch Letters. And Greg Byer, who wrote the book about playing drums with Metallica, you know, like, you know, just to get attention, you know? Right. And, and it kind of worked. People came and they noticed and said, Hey, you know, if you ever do this again, let me know. And so I started making a list of people, <span style="color:red" data-ts="404.305" data-end_ts="404.525" title="404.305" id=c_"404.305">__and__</span> the second year brought in some of the, Jay Anthony Allen joined the team, and Philip O'Toole, who was the engineer at, at the, university and David Hill, who ran this venue at the Student Union called the whole, which would bring in, you know, Reese Chatham or, you know, experimental musicians and, and, avant-garde rock people and stuff like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Doug: </b>So, you know, the, the team just sort of, people just sort of came forward. It was just amazing. And, everybody was willing to, lend a hand and contribute ideas. And, you know, I feel like more than anything else in life, I'd like to be a community organizer. You know, I just like to be with people, bring people together and see amazing things happen. So as Spark developed, I really felt like my role was kind of like to give people space to do the cool stuff that they had the idea to do. You know? And then of course, you know, JP came on like in our third or fourth year and just blew up the whole late night thing that we had been trying to do, you know, and, and just took it to another level. Yeah. It was just, a fabulous experience, I think, for <span style="color:red" data-ts="474.325" data-end_ts="474.525" title="474.325" id=c_"474.325">__<inaudible>__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. JP is a force of nature. He's something else. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Doug: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Before we get, you mentioned the mustache piece, I, I really want to talk about that, but before we get there, one of the things I'd really like doing in my podcast is talking to people about where they came from and, and you know, what their beginning stories are, how they got to be the artists that they are. And I'm really curious for someone who came up, you know, during the timeframe you did and stuff, what were the things that steered you towards becoming a composer of contemporary music, of electronics? You know, what was the convergence of things that influenced you? I'm, I'm really curious about that. Could you tell me a little bit about your <span style="color:red" data-ts="514.125" data-end_ts="514.365" title="514.125" id=c_"514.125">__start__</span>, your beginning story? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Doug: </b>Yeah. You know, I kind of think of my life story as just being a series of me stumbling into incredibly lucky situations. You know, when I was a kid at the age of six, the church my parents went to hired this fabulous guy named Dan First, who was their choir director, and he formed a children's choir. So I started singing in a choir at the age six, learning how to read music, learning how to stay in tune more or less, you know, and all of those things. Then, you know, when I was in fourth grade, I decided, Hey, you know what? I think I want to be the Beatles, you know, or a rock star of some sort. My parents borrowed a guitar from someone, and I started taking lessons. And then after about two years, I realized, wait a minute, this is classical guitar that I'm studying <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Doug: </b>That's not the same as what Eddie Van Halen is doing, you know? But I was already doing that, you know, and, and the Rock thing probably never would've worked out for me too well, although I did play in some pretty bad rock bands in, high school and college a bit, and, some bad, I mean, you know, a a school jazz big band. I was the electric bassist in the band later in life. But, you know, a couple of things that really, I look back on that as being really pointing me in the right direction were that when I was a kid, I had a, a cassette recorder, actually, we had two, and I could record things and play them back and overdub with these two cassette recorders, and I wrote little shows like radio shows, and my brothers and I acted them out, and we recorded things off the radio off of TV and spliced them together to make crazy mashups. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Doug: </b>And, like, we recorded this NPR Star Wars radio show, and we'll like, play back just phrases from Luke Skywalker and have conversations with him and things like that. And so this idea of the tape and being able to cut and manipulate and build things with the recording just was something I was doing starting at about the age of seven or eight or something. Then another thing was when I was a little bit older, my dad loved computers, and he bought an Atari 800 computer and brought it home. And unlike most dads, he, he did buy a few video games, but then he said, okay, I'm not buying you any more video games. Here's the basic programming language, and here's assembly language, figure it out, you know, <laugh>. And I was this naive tween, you know, in Cincinnati, and I thought, well, I guess this is what people do, you know, they just write their own video games, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Doug: </b>And so I started reading books and magazines about programming and, you know, started doing that. And meanwhile, I was in the school choir and the school band and, you know, doing the stuff with the tape recorders. Then when I was in college, I was a late night DJ from like 2:00 AM to 5:00 AM on the college radio station. But all of these things seemed totally separate to me. You know, like I had the, the DJ thing and the recording studio, and I had the music thing where I was playing instruments. I had the cassette manipulation stuff that was just this goofing around, and the programming <span style="color:red" data-ts="690.365" data-end_ts="690.485" title="690.365" id=c_"690.365">__in__</span> the computer, like these were all like, separate, totally disparate parts of my life. And then through a fluke of the way that, US financial aid worked at the time when I was finished with my bachelor's degree, I found out because I was an impoverished 20-year-old or whatever, that I was eligible for one more year of basically free funding at the local university. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Doug: </b>And so I thought, you know what, just for fun, I'm gonna take a bunch of music classes. And one of the first ones was Introduction to Electronic Music. And I can so vividly remember walking into this room in a building which has now been demolished at the Cincinnati Conservatory, lined with egg cartons on the walls, and, you know, a thein, a gigantic emu analog synthesizer, a DX seven, an FZ one sampler, an old Macintosh, you know, a quarter inch two track machine, a one inch eight track machine splicing blocks and all this stuff in the same room. And I just thought, oh my God, you know, the computer, the musical instruments, the microphones, the tape recorders, this is me. You know, I just thought what my life is about, it's all in one place. And so, you know, I just became a studio rat and just lived in the studio and spent my weekends, you know, noodling around and plugging in patch cords and turning knobs and recording things and learning what MIDI was, <laugh>, and it was all there at the same time. So it was like this mishmash, you know? But, you know, I took out a student loan and bought, you know, a computer and a synthesizer and mark of the unicorns performer before it was digital performer, you know, it was just midi and, I thought, this is what my life is about now, you know, so it was pretty, you know, I just kind of stumbled in in that way, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, it's, it's interesting when you come into a situation where you never understood that there was a place for place for all of your interests in one spot, right? Yeah. And it seems like that room was literally that for you, <span style="color:red" data-ts="814.305" data-end_ts="814.525" title="814.305" id=c_"814.305">__it__</span>, it was like walking into the treasure, treasure room or something of the castle, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Doug: </b>Yeah, exactly. And the interesting thing about it was, it was the stuff and the playing around with the stuff that attracted me more than maybe, there wasn't, it wasn't like there was one piece of music I heard and said, oh my gosh, I have to write weird electronic music. You know? It was more like I became intrigued with the idea of the process of being able to build things and play things and connect things together. And, you know, that was really the fun for me, and to a large degree still is, you know, and I do have a goal that, you know, I wanna write music that I like, you know, I don't wanna write music, just like, you know, sometimes people, composers talk about desk music when you have a bunch of like rules or algorithms that seem really fancy schmancy, but then the music sounds terrible, you know? I try to avoid that, you know, but I also want to play around and experiment and push things and see what happens if I try to combine like a big band with spectral chords, you know, and see what, what comes out the other side or whatever, you know, for me, that's definitely part of fun. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's interesting you talk about this idea of desk music, because Yeah, there certainly is, there are a, a lot of instances where the concept so much exceeds the actual implementation in of the music, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Doug: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="899.235" data-end_ts="899.525" title="899.235" id=c_"899.235">__Yeah__</span>. And so, it's interesting that you, that you actually are trying to, extend past that. That's, that's very admirable, and I think sometimes difficult, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Doug: </b>Yeah. You know, I was saying earlier that I think of myself as a community organizer in a lot of ways, and that's probably because I think at least I'm from a large family, I'm one of nine children. And, so it was all about being together and working together from childhood. And even now, both as an artist and a teacher, I'm, I'm really concerned, you know, I understand that not everyone is gonna like the music I do, because not everyone likes KD Perry. Not everyone likes Radiohead. Not everyone likes Bjork. Not everyone likes John Coltrane. You know, people have their own tastes and, you know, and I'm okay with the fact that people might think I'm a nice guy, but that my music sucks <laugh>, you know? Right. It's okay. You know? But definitely for me, you know, part of the fun is being in a space where there are people coming together from different points of view and sharing. And I might say, wow, this guy is such a sweet guy, and he's explaining all the stuff he's doing. It seems so intriguing, and actually what he does, you know, I'm not so blown away by it, you know? Or I might think, gosh, you know, why did he make this 15 minutes of music? It would've been a pretty interesting four and a half minutes of music, you know? Right. That sort of thing. But the getting together and sharing ideas and learning new things always really turns me on. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Now you say that you were really attracted to the gear, maybe more than initially the music, and, and I have to admit that that kind of resonates with me. I, you know, I, for me, a porta studio or a digital reverb, when I was first getting started was a lot more interesting than some of what I heard it being used for. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But I remember that, like a turning point for me was a classroom scenario where they were doing like senior recitals in college. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And one of the people did a piece of, computer tape music, you know, his computer music recorded on tape. Yeah. And then he played along with it with a bassoon Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And it, it was just an anonymous guy. I wouldn't be able to pick him out of a crowd or a lineup. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And I can't even remember what it sounded like, but I remember that the idea of the acoustic instrumentation combined with the electronics and, and sort of like the pure clarity of the computer music Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, which just like opened my head to consider this as a possible direction. Right. Yeah. What were the things, what were the musical things that sort of took you beyond just being a gearhead, right? Because like getting into the gear means you might have gone on to be literally a studio rat, you know, an engineer or a, something like that. But obviously you took a jump to be a composer. What was the, what were the musical things that drew you that direction? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Doug: </b>Well, I think definitely as a teenager, and probably a lot of people have had this, you know, experience, I listened to like, tons of pop music, and I thought, okay, I wanna write my own songs. And I started writing my own songs. And, then I thought, you know what? I kind of feel sorry for people like Paul McCartney <laugh>, who, you know, he never learned how to read music. And, you know, he's kind of, you know, I kind of looked forward to myself at 40 years old and thought I'm gonna be bored unless I learned more about how this works. You know? So I wanted to kind of expand my purview because I thought, okay, that way I'm gonna have more fun later, you know, like an investment strategy. It's weird looking on it. But I remember in the first semester of electronic music class, we, he, you know, they assigned pieces for us to listen to. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Doug: </b>And I heard, Morton Niks Wild Bull, which was, I think the second big Buchla piece that he put out on Nonsuch Records back in like 1968 or something like that. And I found it really intriguing. You know, I thought what he was doing at the time really was different than what a lot of the other, sort of experimental computer or electronic music composers were doing back then. You know, it was very pulsed. It had riffs and felt very performed, you know? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I think that was a big early inspiration for me, that piece. And the idea Nik also came and visited our school and did some performances with live instruments of electronics, which I also found interesting. And then of course, Brad Garten came to teach at, the Cincinnati Conservatory because he was pretty sure he would not get tenure at Columbia University. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Doug: </b>And he opened me up to all kinds of cool stuff, including people like Paul Lansky, but also Apex Twin, you know, and, . Other weird, diverse things. And I always tell my students that I think none of us is really unique, you know, you don't wanna have to feel in <span style="color:red" data-ts="1191.325" data-end_ts="1191.525" title="1191.325" id=c_"1191.325">__life__</span> that you have to reinvent the wheel. Right. But hopefully you open yourself up to many, many different things, and then your brain, the blender of your brain sort of like stirs them around and something comes out, which is you, which is your voice and your unique point of view on things. And so that's kind of, you know, like looking back, I think that's, that I've tried to pursue, you know, I went through a huge John Coltrane phase. I would be at the studio in Cincinnati until about midnight, because I knew that at midnight there was this DJ on who would do like these big jazz history things, like tonight part three of the Billie Holiday story. And I would drive home listening to like, you know, an hour of Billie Holiday, you know, and him commenting on it. And yeah, I feel like all of these things were, were inspirations. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's interesting that the number of people I've talked to who have been sort of like influenced and inspired by Brad Garten is, is pretty crazy. He's like the Johnny Appleseed of computer music in a way. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Doug: </b>It's, it's for real. I mean, you know, that experience of having him there in Cincinnati, I mean, obviously it completely transformed my life. You know, I think that if Brad Garten wouldn't have dropped into my life there in Cincinnati, I would be like, you know, a manager at a Kroger grocery store, <laugh>, or who knows what, you know, I can't even imagine where my life would've gone, you know, for all kinds of reasons. You know, you know, eventually when he knew he wasn't gonna stay at Cincinnati, he said, you know what, Doug, I wanna try to apply to the graduate program at Columbia, which would never in my life have occurred to me to do. You know, I just was this sort of mild-mannered, very shy, little Cincinnati mirrored. And I, I just had no idea that this whole world was possible. You know, I just didn't, didn't dare to think that I could go to the, to that, that level, you know? And, but he did. And I went there and lived at the CMC then for like, the next six years, and met my wife there, who was a fabulous violinist. And she also transformed my life, you know, and all kinds of ways, including understanding what performers think and how to write music that engages a performer as well as an audience, you know, and thinking about how those things connect together and all these wonderful things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So did you grow up in the Cincinnati area, or where did you grow up? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Doug: </b>Yeah, I was born in Cincinnati. Grew up on the west side of Cincinnati. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1344.885" data-end_ts="1345.005" title="1344.885" id=c_"1344.885">__I__</span> see. And, you know, when it came, came time to go to college, I had no idea what I was gonna do. I thought I would love to go to Oberlin, which is a fabulous school. But, the family finances didn't look, you know, viable. My parents were wonderful people, but very naive. Neither of them had gone to college. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And so I wasn't sure what I was gonna do. And I got a phone call from Xavier University, which is a little liberal arts school in Cincinnati. And they said, you know, if you apply, you might get a scholarship. And so I applied and got this full ride scholarship. And it was really lucky for me, because again, I never would've, I never would've been able to get into the Cincinnati Conservatory at that stage. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Doug: </b>But at Xavier, being a liberal arts school, they just let everybody in. Right. And I just started taking music classes for fun, thinking, this is just my hobby. I'm just having a great time doing this. You know, eventually they said, well, you know, you have to be a music major to take these classes. And I said, okay, I'm gonna register as a music major, but I'm full on them. You know, I'm never gonna actually get this degree. I don't give a damn about that. And then they eventually said, you know what? You only have to do two more things and you'll get the music degree <laugh>. And, and so I said, okay, I'll stay one extra semester and, and like, finish my piano class or whatever, and write a paper on music theory, you know, on <span style="color:red" data-ts="1418.765" data-end_ts="1418.965" title="1418.765" id=c_"1418.765">__Eric__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1418.995" data-end_ts="1419.285" title="1418.995" id=c_"1418.995">__City__</span>. And that was the lucky thing that enabled me to have another year of financial aid. And then I simultaneously started at the Cincinnati Conservatory, you know, and took the electronic music class and a counterpoint class and, you know, music, history of music in the 20th century class. And all these things were just like blowing my mind. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's interesting the way that you kind of couch this idea then of like, you know, stepping into each of these roles, because I think that the way you talk about it is, it's a very common story for people from the Midwest us, which is that we don't even consider the option of going to New York City. You know, only, only stars go to New York City. Right. Only amazing people go to London <laugh>, or only only movie stars go to la. You know, it's our job to stay in our place. Right, right, right. How difficult was it for you to, at each step of the way kind of drum up the balls to do it, to, to just say, you know what, it doesn't seem like it could possibly work, but I'm in there 
</p>

<p>
<b>Doug: </b><laugh>. Yeah. I think it, it like happened in stages. 'cause you know, one of the luckiest things in my life is that was when I was in high school, I was forced to take a typing class. And so when I was in college, I was able to get all these temp jobs working in offices, like typing up doctors reports and things like that. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And so by the time I was finishing my bachelor's degree, I thought, you know what? I can make a living doing this office work. People, they, they loved anyone who would show up on time and sober and do the work, you know? And I thought, okay, I can mostly do this, you know? And, so I thought, well, I'm gonna take a risk and do this conservatory thing because I know I can make a living. You know, I, I'm not gonna like die. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Doug: </b>And then when I went to New York, that first semester in New York was one of the loneliest times of my life because I was confronted with the big city and didn't know what to do. But luckily, I started making friends, especially people who are hanging out at the, computer music center and then really started stretching out and, and exploring the city and, and, becoming at home in it, you know, but it, it did, you know, like moving to New York was a, was, was scary for me at that stage. 'cause I was so naive. But it transformed my life. It really was a wonderful thing. But again, I think without the guidance of people like Brad, you know, I have no idea where I would be today. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. So, I wanna talk a little bit about, some of your work. First of all, I want to thank you for something which is that, on your website, in your list of works, in addition to, giving people the opportunity to maybe jump over to a video of a performance or something like that you actually provide or some scores for people to review. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Doug: </b>Oh, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. And I think that that's critical because a lot of times when people hear about, modern music, particularly modern music with electronics and especially ones with sort of like a classical bent to it, yeah. It's hard for people to even wrap their heads around how this might be documented <laugh> Yeah. What the opportunities might be for them if they want to document their own work Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> or, you know, what kind of formalism could possibly exist. Yeah. And I think that the, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data">PD</a>F documentation that you provide there is really pretty amazing. Now, your, your vision, you tend to do, graphical scores, but still using sort of the classical staves and a lot of standard notation kind of with like enhancements that bring the tams and the electronics into the score. But you're still kind of stave function on functional with standard scoring, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Doug: </b>Yeah. Yeah. This mustache piece I mentioned earlier is really a, an anomaly for me. Most of my scores are notated pretty conventionally. 'cause my strategy always has been <span style="color:red" data-ts="1648.995" data-end_ts="1649.285" title="1648.995" id=c_"1648.995">__what__</span> I want it to be, that if a person picks up the score and looks at it, it looks as easy as possible. You know? Right. So if they say, oh, I can play this, you know, and there's some that look really scary and complicated, but generally that's my idea, is I wanna make it look as easy and transparent to the performer so that they, there's no barrier for them to sort of join. And even with the electronics, 'cause I've done a slew of pieces with MaxMSP in which the person is playing and there's a max patch that grabs their sound and processes it, or cues and or cues other sounds along with them. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Doug: </b>And the scores really hide most of that, because I think of it as being a duet really, in which there's a soloist or a group on stage, and then a performer who's kind of performing the Max patch and driving it and sort of finessing it and noodling with details during that, that enterprise, you know, of the performance. But, you know, I really want, for the performer, I want them to feel free to just play music. And like, for instance, at Seamus, there was this panel session about performance, and one person mentioned that they, one of the performers mentioned that she hates Click Tracks. And I have to say, like, I hate click tracks <laugh>, you know what, if you're recording to, to film in the studio, of course, okay, that's cool. But on stage, you know, I want people to feel free to play. And I always love it if the electronics can follow the people rather than people feeling like they're in a, a tourniquet. Like, and they have to lock into a track that might not be at the right tempo for them all the time and things like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>How much of the, the use of standard notation, you kind of mentioned it this way, but I just want to clarify, is, is some of the use of standardization then just literally to make it so that the performers will at least initially be comfortable approaching the work? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Doug: </b>Yeah, exactly. Exactly. So I want them to say, I want them to glance at it when I say, will you play this? And they glance at it and say, oh, yeah, this looks fine. And then later they might say, oh my gosh, there's some really tricky stuff in here. Oh dear, what <span style="color:red" data-ts="1771.325" data-end_ts="1771.485" title="1771.325" id=c_"1771.325">__am__</span> I get myself into? But by then, they're committed, you know? <span style="color:red" data-ts="1773.605" data-end_ts="1773.685" title="1773.605" id=c_"1773.605">__Right__</span>. And hopefully they'll, the time to figure out the tricky bits, it's kind of weird, but in life, I just feel like, honestly, we all need to respect one another. And part of respect to a performer is that I have some idea how your instrument works, and I wanna write something that you can play on the instrument. It might be challenging, but it's gonna fit the instrument and it's gonna feel good. And ideally, I want you as a performer to be able to show off a little bit and sound great, you know, and, and be happy doing this performance. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Doug: </b>You know, I, I really feel like it's, it's a matter of respect to the performer to make it not look scary, to make it feel okay. And they understand, like, here and there it might be kind of tricky, but generally I'm on their side. You know, there's so many composers who for reasons I cannot fathom, you know, have this sort of elitist mentality of like, I am the genius and you are the robot who's gonna perform my music. And I find that so disheartening. You know, to me, again, it's the community organizer thing. Like, we, we are working on something together. We're trying to make something happen. You know, we're partners in this, you know, that kind of attitude is, I try to put that into everything I do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. So what is it then, with this latest work, entitled Teach Some Cheat Sum <laugh>? Yeah. That basically then you threw away all that stuff. And this is based off <span style="color:red" data-ts="1854.345" data-end_ts="1854.565" title="1854.345" id=c_"1854.345">__of__</span> what I understand and what I hear you saying is that this is based off of drawings of mustaches, really? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Doug: </b>Yeah. Yeah. So, so I did a work a couple years ago called Sapling, which was for piano and Max MSP. And it was one of the most complicated scores I wrote for the performer. It, again, it doesn't look super scary if you glance at it, but it's nearly impossible to play. And I've had a few fabulous pianists play it. But for the newer piece, first of all, I had a deadline to write a piece, and I thought, you know, I'm not gonna, I have to strategize, like, what do I wanna work on in creating this piece? And what do I want the experience of the performers to be? You know? And I decided I was really interested to try to hack some object. You know, there <span style="color:red" data-ts="1899.805" data-end_ts="1899.925" title="1899.805" id=c_"1899.805">__was__</span> some famous pieces of art where people have like hacked video games. So like, you're in Mario Brothers world, but it's just clouds floating by and there's no game or, you know, other things like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Doug: </b>So I stumbled upon on the Spark <span style="color:red" data-ts="1912.885" data-end_ts="1913.165" title="1912.885" id=c_"1912.885">__Fund__</span> website this, voice synthesizer chip called the E <span style="color:red" data-ts="1916.945" data-end_ts="1917.165" title="1916.945" id=c_"1916.945">__Mic__</span> two, which you can drive and, you know, make it say things, you know, it's very much like the old fashioned kind of Stephen Hawking 1980s voice synthesizer sounds. And I thought, I don't know why, but I'm really intrigued to hack this thing and make it spit out gobbledygook <laugh>. And so that was kind of my thought, like, okay, I wanna write a piece in which I make a voice synthesizer babble. And, it actually turned out to be a lot more difficult than I thought it would be to make it babble, because it's designed for schmos who just wanted to talk. And so anytime it would say something that was not coherent speech, it would flag an error. And the big problem is that all its errors are spoken. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Doug: </b>So, you know, it would say like, blah, blah, blah, blah, command error, you know, <laugh>, and I was doing this for like two months, and my little five-year-old daughter was walking around the apartment saying, error in command, you know, command error in parameter, you know? And I was like, oh, no, I don't know what her teacher thinks I'm doing at home. But, but so I thought, I want this thing to interact with live musicians, and I want it to be alive in a way. And, this hacked synthesizer chip, and I don't want the musicians again to feel like a click track thing where they have to like be locked in with it and all of this stuff. And I wanted it to be fun. You know, I just, I'm interested to explore different things, and I wanted to have a lighthearted piece. So I was applying for a grant, and they had to come up with a name for the piece somehow. And I don't exactly know how the idea of like famous mustaches just floated into my head, like Frank Zappa or Salvador Dali, you know, or John Waters, or Ned Flanders. So I thought, you know, I wanna make this piece about mustaches. And so the, the title of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2020.425" data-end_ts="2020.645" title="2020.425" id=c_"2020.425">__the__</span> piece is Teach Some Cheat Sum and Teach Some is an anagram for Mustache and Cheat Sum is an anagram for mustache. So, it's my mustache piece. I love anagrams. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I've noticed that in a number of your works there, <laugh>, you have the anagram names. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Doug: </b>It's kind of silly. And some of the ones that seem indecipherable are anagrams of the names of people. Like, I'm doing a series of pieces for people in my family and their anagrams of their names and pieces going back several years now. Every now and then I'll be like, oh yeah, this one's from my brother Chuck, or whatever, you know, that sort of thing. Chuck's a great guy. He deserves a piece. Actually, I don't think I've done Chuck yet, so I have to put that on my list. Yeah. So in this piece, for the performers, you know, it's also my homage to Pauline <span style="color:red" data-ts="2061.855" data-end_ts="2062.205" title="2061.855" id=c_"2061.855">__Alora__</span>, who tragically died almost a year ago now, and on Thanksgiving day of 2016. And I found her to be an inspirational human being. You know, she's another one of these people who seemed to embody something magical, and I can't explain exactly why there's no one piece of her music that <span style="color:red" data-ts="2083.605" data-end_ts="2083.725" title="2083.605" id=c_"2083.605">__it__</span> would point at and say, this music blew my mind. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Doug: </b>But there's something about her and her attitude towards life and music and music making, which I find to be just highly amazing. And, in fact, I'm planning now to do a symposium at Brooklyn College next fall, serve in honor of her, which I'm calling legacies of Pauline <span style="color:red" data-ts="2104.845" data-end_ts="2105.325" title="2104.845" id=c_"2104.845">__Oliveres__</span>. And we're hoping to, you know, put out a call for people who wanna write a paper or give a talk about Pauline. We'll have some performances and stuff. But, so I wanted to do something in homage to Pauline, but on the other hand, I'm not Pauline and I'm not going to just imitate Pauline, but I, I know a lot of her pieces have instructions for people to work together to do something. And some of the pieces are almost like games. And so this cheat <span style="color:red" data-ts="2129.745" data-end_ts="2129.965" title="2129.745" id=c_"2129.745">__sum__</span>, teach some piece or teach some cheat <span style="color:red" data-ts="2131.665" data-end_ts="2131.885" title="2131.665" id=c_"2131.665">__sum__</span>. It's kind of like a game. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Doug: </b>And, the two players are musically drawing mustaches, and they can use any sort of musical sounds they want and ways of mapping a mustache shape onto sound that they want. And they can start half a mustache as an invitation for the other person to complete the mustache. They can draw a complete mustache, they can choose among different mustaches <span style="color:red" data-ts="2153.405" data-end_ts="2153.565" title="2153.405" id=c_"2153.405">__and__</span> different parts of the piece. And then, you know, after about a couple minutes of the piece, the voice synthesizer starts, blurting sounds into their mustache games and kind of disrupting things. And they have to sort of change what they're doing based on, what the voice synthesizer does. And it starts, you know, it's blurts kind of change. And near the end of the piece, mostly says just consonants, like, you know, and then near the end of the piece, it actually starts saying some vowels, you know, and that's like an arrival point for me. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So it's very goofy, and I'm not sure how much fun it is, you know, from the audience. You don't know exactly what's going on. And I may add video to it when we do it the next time, actually, to make a little bit more clear to some degree for the audience what's happening. But the whole idea was to kind of create a game for the players so that every time it's different, but that they have a pathway through, you know, to try to make it engaging for them. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I would say having, having gotten a chance to look at a bunch of your work, it is, even though you took a diversion with how it was notated, it actually struck me as being, you know, sort of of a form with your other work in that it uses some traditional instrumentation, which is too violinists. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2227.425" data-end_ts="2227.645" title="2227.425" id=c_"2227.425">__Yep__</span>. But it also, they're offered the opportunity to vocalize some things. So they start off the piece, make it with little vocalizations and stuff. It integrates kind of this external device, which is the, the speech synthesizer, but you also have a laptop, which I assume is doing some of the score direction or something. I don't even know. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Doug: </b>It's Yeah. Basically timers so that they Oh, okay. Kind of have an idea of where they are in the piece. Got 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It. Just, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Doug: </b>You know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Doug: </b>It's a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2257.855" data-end_ts="2258.205" title="2257.855" id=c_"2257.855">__match__</span> <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. But, you know, and then, another work I saw was a piano thing, which <span style="color:red" data-ts="2262.765" data-end_ts="2262.885" title="2262.765" id=c_"2262.765">__was__</span> a very complex piano thing, but there was also some manipulation of the string, some hand motions and hand attacks on the wood of the instrument. Yeah. But, you know, also, some implication of electronics you've done. You've gone so far as to do work with like choir and electronics and stuff like that with large form ensembles. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, I'm just wondering, what is it about, you know, if we say that electronics plus like extended technique plus traditional technique, really the combination is all a part of your work. What is it that, what is it that makes you want to see all of those things? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Doug: </b>I guess part of it for me is that I, I mean, this might sound really hokey, but I kind of want to create magic. You know, I think that all performance is a kind of theater, and I've done things with theater in my works too over the years. I'm really interested to <span style="color:red" data-ts="2320.245" data-end_ts="2320.405" title="2320.245" id=c_"2320.245">__keep__</span>, keep doing that kind of stuff. But I think that, you know, when someone comes on stage, whether they're playing a Beethoven string quartet or whether it's, you know, a Beatles cover band or, or if it's Led Zeppelin or you know, whatever, that there is an element of theater when you take on the stage and the, the performance of a piece has this dimension of pulling people in and things happen that we don't know how it happens or why it happens. And I feel like technology and electronics today give us a fabulous set of tools to make things happen that seem magical. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Doug: </b>And you know what I, I kind of feel like, you know, it varies from piece to piece and the moods change. Like, I have pieces that are morose and sad, and I have pieces that are, you know, playful. But in every piece, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2367.245" data-end_ts="2367.445" title="2367.245" id=c_"2367.245">__wanna__</span> take people out of ordinary life for a while and give them some kind of different mental experience, take them some place, you know, take them on a little trip and then release them back into ordinary life. And, you know, whether or not they've had a good time or how it affects them, I don't really know. But you know, it used to be that my dream was to have a moment in every piece that would be like, the clouds opening up, you know, and the finger of God comes down and touches your nose or something. I don't necessarily try to be that melodramatic anymore, but it still happens sometimes. It's about trying to conjure an experience for people. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I think that's appreciated though, because quite frankly, one, one of the problems is, I, I'm not sure that all performers have caught up to the fact that now people tend to walk around with pieces of magic in their pocket, right? I mean, if you think about what an iPhone is and what that would've looked like to someone 10 years ago, it would've looked like a box of magic, right? Yeah. You know, so the idea of like getting out in front of people's expectations of what technology provides, I think is difficult. My question for you then is how do you engage with the technology? Are you a coder? Are you comfortable doing electronic? You know, do you, do you, have, clouds of solder smoke, rolling out of the windows of your apartment? Or how, how do you engage with the technology? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Doug: </b>I, I, one of my big problems in life is that I just love everything and everybody. And so, you know, when I first got into computer music way back when, you know, Brad Garten was teaching us how to do cmix on a next machine, you know, it's kind of dating myself there, you know. But what was great about that experience was that I learned how to talk to the computer and I had already done basic programming in a little bit of a assembly language on my Atari at home. So the coding aspect of that, you know, the scripting and coding all made sense to me right away. And, that was great. And the other cool thing about back in the day when it was not real time, and maybe this is something I got from Brad specifically, was the idea that it should sound good. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Doug: </b>And part of that is the production of the piece. You know, I remember going to computer music conferences and hearing these people saying, I'm doing this in real time, it's amazing. And then I would listen to it and it would sounded like, you know, like a proteus module spinning out random sounds. And I just thought, this sounds terrible, you know, I don't care if it's amazingly produced, but it sounds terrible, you know? So, you know, partially the sort of like listening to the sound itself, partially coding that has guided me, you know, over the years and when I first started doing MSP in 2000, my instant thought was, I'm doing this big piece, but I wanna build a pile of modules that I can jam with. You know, and I still use some of those modules today that I started building in like 2000, 2001, partially because I'm lazy, I guess. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Doug: </b>But, you know, it's, you know, about building instruments that then can be used and played and experimented with. So one of the, lucky things later on was that, once I moved back to New York, Douglas Edo was at the Columbia Computer Music Center, and he was teaching this class in <span style="color:red" data-ts="2562.965" data-end_ts="2563.125" title="2562.965" id=c_"2562.965">__our__</span> duino, and I just came and audited his class. Maya and I both audited his class one semester, and then I got the hardware bug, and, I bought, Nicholas Collins' book, handmade Electronic Music, which is fabulous. And, started putting together little 26 cent chips and resistors and capacitors and, you know, that whole idea of hardware hacking really. And using sensors, you know, I really sort of got into that. And so now in my, Sonic Arts program at Brooklyn College, you know, we have, you know, basically I'm trying now to create a program, which is everything I wish I could have studied as a student. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Doug: </b>So, you know, we have the hardware building electronic music instruments part. We have interactive music with Max MSP, and Arduino, and we have recording and mixing classes and, you know, trying to like, have this whole panorama of possibilities for people. And, you know, some of this I'm still learning myself, you know, and life is this process of following paths and, and, and following your bliss, you know, as Joseph Campbell used to say, trying to, keep yourself engaged and alive, you know, I think that's crucially important to not fall into a rutt, you know, and get stuck there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, it's interesting you say that because the one thing I was curious about was, in your role as a composer, do you ever feel like you get your, you're by coding some of your own tools and especially these module type things that you use over long term, or building certain or being comfortable with certain kinds of electronic and electronics building. Do you ever find, or do you ever have to like battle a desire to go down a certain path because you already have the tools or you already have the knowledge, or you already feel comfortable with that stuff? Or do you not even consider that a trap? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Doug: </b>I'm not too worried about that. Like, oh no, I've used reverb before. I shouldn't use reverb. Like, ah, but, I guess I am always, I'm curious. So part of that is that, okay, I have my flanger, I have my, you know, pinging pong delays and I have my other things, these stacks of instruments that create riffs and other things. But, you know, those riffs I did last time, they're kind of lame. You know, I wanna take that and hack it and try to do something new or, or, you know, this time I'm, you know, interested in a different thing and I'm gonna try to, build something else, you know? It's tricky because I think that some people do get, they do fall in a hole of just building tools and not actually making music. I don't think it's bad to just buy a tool and play it and explore it and learn it, you know? We have a couple analog modular systems at Brooklyn College now. We bought two reins last year because those are beautiful instruments, you know, it's okay to not build your own instruments, I think. But there's also a fun for me in getting under the hood and seeing how things work and be able to muck around a little bit and do your own nefarious twist on something that's been done before, or just learn how it works. You know, it can be fun. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure, man. I'll tell you, I have like 50 other questions I'd love to ask you, but our time is pretty much already shot. So I'll have to save some of these for the next time we talk <laugh>. But, one last question before we go. You're a person, I mean, you're openly admitting that you like, kind of pushing yourself and constantly learning. What are some things that you're really excited by right now? Some things that have caught your attention in, you're trying to get your head wrapped around? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Doug: </b>Well, my, my engagement with hardware electronics is an ongoing journey, you know, because, you know, it's taken a while to just figure out basics of how electricity really works. Like what is a capacitor doing, you know, and things like that. There's a really cute book that I read about two years ago, which I love called, there Are No Electrons, by a guy named Ken Amdal. I think there are no electrons. And it's a science fiction story about, how electricity is actually a bunch of little green aliens running through the wires and not electrons. And it's incredibly silly, but it really explains electricity in a fabulous way. It's a great book. Not the sort of boring typical textbook thing, you know? So for me, that's really important. You know, I think learning is hands-on to a large degree, like learning, touching, doing, you know, is, is exciting for me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Doug: </b>And so I'm still very interested in exploring the hardware. I'm really interested to create instruments for myself. I'm a very clumsy and awkward person, and I've seen some nerdy composers on stage try to do like performance art, dance and stuff like that. And it looks really, you know, kind of, you just feel like, oh dear, this guy, I feel so sorry for him. He has no idea how silly he looks, but yet it's taking a leap. And so I have some designs for some hardware, instruments I wanna build that I would perform with physical motion being part of the performance, not just moving a fader, which is pretty much what, you know, I've done traditionally, partially because of the former shy, you know, aspect of myself. And that's how I be. Another reason I became a composer is I was super shy on stage and had incredible, stage fright, you know, so, so I really want to explore physicality of performance, building my own instruments, adapting instruments, and continuing to pursue like multimedia. And I have ideas for some more pieces that went integrate theater and stuff like that. Another program we have at Brooklyn, we have this MFA program called Pima, which is Performance and Interactive Media Arts. And it's basically people from all arts backgrounds getting together and creating multimedia performances. So dancers and coders and visual artists and actors and musicians. And so to me that's really inspiring too, seeing all these people get together on a team and, and produce crazy far out work. It's really exciting to, to watch happen.

<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that sounds really exciting, and certainly it's a program. I would love to come and stick a nose in sometimes, see what, see what y'all are doing. It sounds fascinating. Doug, I wanna thank you so much for the time to, of talking. This has been really interesting to get to kind of hear some of your, your flow and stuff. It's very inspiring for me because actually there are so many parallels between your story and mine even so far as things like, you know, how you deal with, personally, interact with your stage fright is part of, part of stuff. Again, I, so many questions I would love to pose for you, for, for I guess a future talk. So we'll get together again soon to, to follow up on this. All right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Doug: </b>Yeah, this was great. Thanks so much for having me. It was a blast. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, thank you for being here. I really appreciate it. And with that, I'll let you have the rest of your day. Thanks and okay, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Doug: </b>Bye-Bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thanks to Doug for hanging out and talking, and thanks to you for listening. Really appreciate it. And I saw a great show last night, which reminds me to remind you. Don't just sit in your basement, get outta your mom's basement and go out and see some shows. Support local musicians, support national musicians, or whoever the hell shows up in your backyard. Make sure you get out there. It's really important. Thanks a lot. If you have any questions or comments, drop me a line, DD <span style="color:red" data-ts="3017.125" data-end_ts="3018.885" title="3017.125" id=c_"3017.125">__g@cyclingseventyfour.com__</span>. Otherwise, I'll catch you next week. Bye.
