<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. This week I have, a great opportunity, and this one came to me sort of, by the wiles of, of Facebook trying to tell me what I'm sure I'm going to like. Facebook pointed me towards a blog posting about, the endangered guitar, as, as created by today's guest, Hans Toman. Endangered guitar is a really interesting kind of, combination of standard, standard and enhanced guitar technique with computer systems. And we're going to, kind of be quizzing ha about that because so often we find that guitarists don't really like interacting with a computer. So it'll be interesting to hear his take on it. But with that, I'd like to introduce you to Hans. Hans, how are you this evening? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Hans Tammen: </b>I'm great. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thank you so much for doing the podcast with us. I, I really appreciate it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Hans: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="66.74" data-end_ts="67.03" title="66.74" id=c_"66.74">__Well__</span>, thanks for having me here on your show. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, I am curious, I, when I look at your bio information, actually, you and I have interacted over the years, . <affirmative> particularly, in relationship to your work with, harvest <span style="color:red" data-ts="81.28" data-end_ts="81.63" title="81.28" id=c_"81.28">__Works__</span> in New York. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. But, I, I've known you for a while, but it was interesting when I started looking through your bio information to prepare for this, for this podcast, I was kind of blown away by the number of different groups and ensembles that you've put together, number of releases you've done, you've, you've been a very, you've been a very busy man, <laugh>. And, what I'm curious about, and one of the things I really like asking people is to tell me about, about the background, their background, and how they got to be the artist that they are. And especially in your case, where you are constantly exploring the front edge of experimentalism, both as a solo artist and as part of an ensemble. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, I'm really curious what your background is and how, how you got where you are. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Hans: </b>Well, let's talk about the art first, if you can separate it from, the rest. I started out as a guitarist like way over 40 years ago in the seventies. I wanted to be the new Richie Blackmore in the eighties. I was playing jazz all the time. In the nineties, I was more, connected with British improviser scene, <span style="color:red" data-ts="160.83" data-end_ts="160.95" title="160.83" id=c_"160.83">__a__</span> certain kind of style that prides itself in like, you know, fast reactions, very sound oriented playing, stuff. And, well then towards the end of the nineties, you know, when you play sounds, when you draw sounds and noises from, the guitar and <span style="color:red" data-ts="183.84" data-end_ts="184.04" title="183.84" id=c_"183.84">__when__</span> you wanna expand your palette, when it comes to sound, the the next step is really electronics, because that's what, for me, electronics is really good for, you know, for Tamra sound and noises and, and these things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Hans: </b>So, since roughly the year 2000, I did a lot with electronics, notably with Maxims <span style="color:red" data-ts="208.52" data-end_ts="208.64" title="208.52" id=c_"208.52">__p__</span> and, you know, in the last couple of years, I expanded my horizon, much beyond the guitar as the instrument. Well, that kind of like is my, my artistic, background. Sure. I have a degree in, adult education and, the nineties I was a union organizer in Germany who, focused on issues of video surveillance and data monitoring and <span style="color:red" data-ts="236.84" data-end_ts="237" title="236.84" id=c_"236.84">__on__</span> the workplace. And, since, two thousands, I have worked for 14 years, for <span style="color:red" data-ts="243.12" data-end_ts="243.28" title="243.12" id=c_"243.12">__Harvest__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="243.28" data-end_ts="243.6" title="243.28" id=c_"243.28">__Works__</span> Digital Media Art Center, to help artists creating their interactive artworks, which I quit in December because, I wanna actually go back to teaching, and I'm glad right now that I teach at School of Visual Arts in Sarah Lawrence College. Right. We'll see how that goes in the future. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that's, that's really pretty cool. So you're, you're teaching in the College of Visual Arts? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Hans: </b>Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And, so what is your, so almost everything I know about you is, is primarily coming from music and, and, experimental sound. Ha. Do you have a background doing video art as well, or are you bringing kind of sound art concepts into the school of Visual Arts? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Hans: </b>No, it's just like, it's really visuals. I teach, max and processing. Oh, I see, okay. <span style="color:red" data-ts="293.96" data-end_ts="294.04" title="293.96" id=c_"293.96">__But__</span> it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="294.16" data-end_ts="294.2" title="294.16" id=c_"294.16">__an__</span> art course. It's an art course, for visuals. I mean, when you work at Harvest <span style="color:red" data-ts="300.13" data-end_ts="300.48" title="300.13" id=c_"300.13">__Works__</span>, I mean, we had a long history, we have a long history as a sound out place, but in fact, the vast majority of clients that came to harvest <span style="color:red" data-ts="310.03" data-end_ts="310.32" title="310.03" id=c_"310.03">__work__</span> were visual artists. So <span style="color:red" data-ts="312.78" data-end_ts="313" title="312.78" id=c_"312.78">__you__</span>, you get some understanding of visual arts, interactive arts with visuals. And, so I just, was very interesting. Right now I'm also interested in expanding my, my horizon to that. So I'm really planning on working with a large ensemble of electronic musicians and, light artists. Which, I had done a couple of experiments in New York already with visual artists, with light artists, laser artists who, who, I conduct and I play with. So I'm expanding my horizon in that area today, as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What are some of the areas of that that you're personally finding really interesting? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Hans: </b>Personally finding interesting, any kind of like maybe socially conscious, data visualization? One of my students at S VRA right now is, working on a piece that takes life internet data from, Beijing about the air pollution, and maps it, onto, a thousand year old, brush painting that depicts, nature Rivers and stuff, from China. And that paintings 11 meters wide, and he displaces the pixels according to the <span style="color:red" data-ts="396.76" data-end_ts="396.96" title="396.76" id=c_"396.76">__PA__</span> Beijing air pollution. I found this very beautiful. It's gorgeous, and it's, has an interesting message, that we should look at. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That sounds amazing. Now, in your, in your time at Harvest <span style="color:red" data-ts="410.69" data-end_ts="411.04" title="410.69" id=c_"410.69">__Works__</span>, one of the things that you kind of did was help organize and help help people through the process of making their projects. And I think one of the things I think would be useful for those people who don't know much, those listeners who don't know much about, about Harvest Works is to kind of, give us a quick capsule overview of what that represented, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Hans: </b>What Harvest <span style="color:red" data-ts="436.84" data-end_ts="437.12" title="436.84" id=c_"436.84">__work__</span> represented. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Hans: </b>Yeah. Okay. Well, harvest Work was founded in 1977. It started out as a place, that, gave composers of electronic music access to synthesizers. You know, at that time, you either were part of a university where had a lot of cash in your hand to buy a, a synthesizer, and there were a couple of people <span style="color:red" data-ts="458.64" data-end_ts="458.88" title="458.64" id=c_"458.64">__that__</span> got together and made a non-for-profit, got these synthesizers and rendered them out for $3 an hour or something like this. The next step was, of course, to record these materials. So Houseworks also became a recording studio. Then the next step was, publish the Materials and Houseworks, also started to have a record label <span style="color:red" data-ts="479.27" data-end_ts="479.56" title="479.27" id=c_"479.27">__tell__</span> us, that, brought out a lot of materials, over the years. And since I was there and I was riding the wave, the 2000 <span style="color:red" data-ts="489.22" data-end_ts="489.44" title="489.22" id=c_"489.22">__was__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="489.44" data-end_ts="489.56" title="489.44" id=c_"489.44">__a__</span> a year where, interactive art really took off with like everybody having, laptops and, so on. And so we started selling less studio space or synthesizers or stuff that were already thrown away many years ago. Right. But we started selling Brain Power, people who know programming, people who help, with building your project. And, so also the education program, took off, a lot, and that was the time that I was there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. I have been blown away by the number of different situations where I'll be performing with someone or somebody will be in town and I'll talk to 'em. And when we talk about the work that they're doing, they point to, they point to time spent at Harvest Works as being the thing that launched them into their most productive, or most, or the, the, the phase that helped them develop their ultimate mm-hmm. <affirmative>, or, you know, at least pent ultimate, work. I am thinking that you must have seen an extraordinary amount of great work coming through that place. I mean, just because I keep on running into people and they say, yeah, I did this thing at, you know, I did this thing at Harvest <span style="color:red" data-ts="576.09" data-end_ts="576.44" title="576.09" id=c_"576.09">__Works__</span>, and I worked with Luke, I worked with Matt or somebody mm-hmm. <affirmative>, and, and I've been working that, that just blew my mind open. I've been working on that ever since. You must have seen what hundreds of these, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Hans: </b>Well, we had good times where I had like, the maximum, I had, what, 280, artists a year in, in, in a year, <laugh>. And that does not mean, that I have been involved in depth with each of their projects. Sometimes there were only people who signed up for a class, but most of them also talk with me about, what class is the right one for their project and so on. We were specialized, not in like some, you know, like some one fits all concept. We were specialized in working with artists on their individual project, so I had a good time. Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> Well, one of the things, yeah, you, you say that there's this project orientation, and I would say that that's how everybody frames it. I mean, they may have taken like some of the, the standard classes, but the way that they, the thing that they viewed as the most important work was them working on their project. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> <span style="color:red" data-ts="655.48" data-end_ts="655.52" title="655.48" id=c_"655.48">__with__</span> the help of, of Harvest Works. And this kind of goes back to what you were saying about where you change from being a center with synthesizers to being a center with brain power. And that's, that's a really powerful twist, but something that certainly, certainly has helped an awful lot of artists make their way. Who were some of the people that were working with Harvest Works that that helped, helped with these projects? I know Luke Deba did some of it, right? Mm-hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Hans: </b><affirmative>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Hans: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="684.06" data-end_ts="684.28" title="684.06" id=c_"684.06">__Oh__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="684.28" data-end_ts="684.52" title="684.28" id=c_"684.28">__Luke__</span> worked for us, a little bit. Then in, I think the bulk of the work for many years was done by Dafna <span style="color:red" data-ts="692.31" data-end_ts="692.8" title="692.31" id=c_"692.31">__Naftali__</span> and Matthew Ostrovsky. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And then we had people who were with us like for two or three years, and then took totally off, to better pastures like Zachary CELs, for example. Oh, yes, Adam Rockar. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And in the area of like hardware, we had Eric Singer working for us, Nicole Carroll. And, that was all good stuff, and I always was trying to keep people with us for a long time because, if you can trust your engineer and, you know, at some point you just talk to the client, talk to the artisan, you send them over, and if you're lucky, you'll never hear from them again, <laugh>, because they're totally taken care of by Matthew from the beginning to the end, you know? Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Ma Matthew's actually really a mm-hmm. <affirmative> a particular thing. He's somebody I should interview at some point, because the number of people that have been touched by him has been, is really amazing. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. But what's interesting to me is what you, the, the list that you gave is sort of like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="760.56" data-end_ts="760.68" title="760.56" id=c_"760.56">__I__</span> is sort of like, the roster of up and coming media tech artists, it's, it's pretty amazing that you got to work with <span style="color:red" data-ts="770.48" data-end_ts="770.68" title="770.48" id=c_"770.48">__the__</span>, with them. And I, you know, a lot of that is because also it's New York and there's some amazing talent available there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Hans: </b>Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah. I mean, there are a lot of people who apply to work for Harvest <span style="color:red" data-ts="783.77" data-end_ts="784.12" title="783.77" id=c_"783.77">__Works__</span>, and too bad we didn't have 10 times as much, work to give to everybody, would've been great. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So let's talk about your work a little bit, and particularly this concept of the endangered guitar. So I read this blog post, and, and it was a, it was a nice but relatively short overview of what you, what you were doing. And, I'll put a link to it up on the website, but I'd like it if you could kind of explain the process of getting to where you are with that, because it's, it's a pretty, just, the short story is pretty interesting, and I guess I would like to hear maybe the longer story. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Hans: </b>Yeah. Yeah. It was just because the Almanac, that it was published was in Berlin that I did <span style="color:red" data-ts="830.72" data-end_ts="830.84" title="830.72" id=c_"830.72">__a__</span> lecture last year. They only wanted like 500, words or something like this. I see. So I had my previous publications, I had to like, seriously, scale down. However, how it came, if we wanna go back to the eighties where I was a jazz <span style="color:red" data-ts="845.86" data-end_ts="846.08" title="845.86" id=c_"845.86">__ski__</span> guitarist, there's this first, the main thing between what I did in the seventies and eighties. And, what I did after that until today, is the difference between, I was interested before in like, melody and harmony, and after that I was interested in sound, <span style="color:red" data-ts="862.37" data-end_ts="862.72" title="862.37" id=c_"862.37">__tamra__</span> and rhythm, and then I would also add dynamics. And how it ha happened was towards the end of the <span style="color:red" data-ts="869.68" data-end_ts="869.92" title="869.68" id=c_"869.68">__eight__</span> eighties, I was playing, the usual kind of jazz stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Hans: </b>And towards the end, I, I started to get more and more interested in these long intros or <span style="color:red" data-ts="881.32" data-end_ts="881.48" title="881.32" id=c_"881.32">__outdoors__</span>, these intros, especially where everybody's very careful <span style="color:red" data-ts="884.7" data-end_ts="884.92" title="884.7" id=c_"884.7">__of__</span> what we are doing right now. You know, we, we try to find sounds to come together, and then somebody counts in the head <laugh>, and the whole energy drained out of me, right. <laugh>. And so that's why I make the joke usually today that I'm only playing the intros and outros <span style="color:red" data-ts="902.6" data-end_ts="902.8" title="902.6" id=c_"902.6">__too__</span> these days. And that's about it. So what it is, is behind the scenes <span style="color:red" data-ts="907.62" data-end_ts="907.84" title="907.62" id=c_"907.62">__is__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="907.84" data-end_ts="908.08" title="907.84" id=c_"907.84">__this__</span> change to like, that my ears got bigger, more interested in Tamra and in sound. Well, the first step, of course, what you do when you're a guitarist and, you wanna do sound, you get like all these, you know, distortion pedals and crap like this. So I had, I mean, remember this was like 1990, so I bought this amazingly expensive, harmonizer and the, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="940.12" data-end_ts="940.36" title="940.12" id=c_"940.12">__loop__</span> pedal that had a fixed lube of two seconds, <span style="color:red" data-ts="943.18" data-end_ts="943.4" title="943.18" id=c_"943.18">__you__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="943.4" data-end_ts="943.48" title="943.4" id=c_"943.4">__know__</span>, this kind of stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Hans: </b>And I had several of these things in a row, and I was like creating this amazingly loud and dense wall of noises. The problem with that is, of course, that these pedals are not dynamic at all, right? It's also with this, approach, you can even sing into it, and it's all makes the same sound <laugh> and nobody can play with you because you make that much, noise. You know, like everybody else can go to the bar and drink while you're like burning the place to the ground. So I had a good time with that for a short time. But then when you wanna really, draw sounds off the guitar, the guitar is great when you work with gadgets, stick stones, mallets, motors, and stuff like this, and start like, you know, getting noises out of the instrument. Fred Fri style, if you wanna see who popularized that kind of like, approach to the guitar, that was for us, Fred Frith. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Hans: </b>Right. And so the next, 10 years I spend really doing that kind of guitar, playing the guitar flat on my lap, using pot scratchers, vacuum cleaners, all kinds of materials, self-made motors. I I equipped the guitar with lots of other, you know, pickups and made, you know, these long solo concerts or play together with people that, approached <span style="color:red" data-ts="1030.34" data-end_ts="1030.56" title="1030.34" id=c_"1030.34">__the__</span>, their instruments, like the saxophone or the percussion the same way I approached the guitar. And again, towards the end, of the nineties, the, what do you do? Like, I mean, first is I was looking still for new sounds, and I started using pedals again and started complicated routings with like mixers and stuff. And, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1059.15" data-end_ts="1059.44" title="1059.15" id=c_"1059.15">__that__</span> what became just too complicated. And then all of a sudden this shift happened where laptops became affordable and everybody had them. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Hans: </b>And it made, all of a sudden it made sense to take a laptop with you <span style="color:red" data-ts="1074.9" data-end_ts="1075.12" title="1074.9" id=c_"1074.9">__on__</span> to a performance intel instead of schlepping like a big, desktop machine with you, with monitor and stuff like this, and was kind of normal. And many artists actually have this approach. You have a setup, and now you wanna move the entire setup onto your computer. And that's what I did. I moved my setup on the computer programming it in max m s <span style="color:red" data-ts="1099.24" data-end_ts="1099.36" title="1099.24" id=c_"1099.24">__p__</span>. But of course, as you very well know, it, didn't take longer than a month or two that you figure out what else you can do, what you would never be able to do with cables and pedals and in real life in the real world. So I just got completely off, into a different area. I got a headstart, I have to say, because my, usual explanation is, I wanted to learn Max. So I married a max programmer <laugh>, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1128.21" data-end_ts="1128.56" title="1128.21" id=c_"1128.21">__Dafna__</span> was already programming and teaching Max for 10 years. So I got of course, a, a head start with that, right. Except the rest I, I had to learn by myself, because the last thing, what <span style="color:red" data-ts="1138.88" data-end_ts="1138.96" title="1138.88" id=c_"1138.88">__you__</span> wants to do is when become home late at night is like talking about Max s p 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Do more max programming, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Hans: </b>Yeah. Yeah. So, and, so that where the origins of, of that kind of programming are coming from this, this interest and this desire of working with sonic explorations, with textures, with sound and with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1163.28" data-end_ts="1163.52" title="1163.28" id=c_"1163.28">__chamber__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So what are, first of all, what are the kinds of effects that you used to have as pedals that you're now doing on the computer? And then what are the things that you found in the computer that were different than you would ever find in a pedal? What are some of the, what are the, some of the devices and mechanisms that you personally are part of your voice? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Hans: </b>Well, let's say when I started, programming with the idea of mimicking what I had in the real world, in the virtual world, which, again, went down the drain, within a few, months, I had a couple of, these, complicated, these complex digic pedals, that do forwards backwards <span style="color:red" data-ts="1212.14" data-end_ts="1212.36" title="1212.14" id=c_"1212.14">__or__</span> kind of like weird harmonizing, stuff, and, so on. So these, these were interesting. And also, I didn't have any loop pedals anymore because I figured out, when I use loop pedals, I use it always in moments when I'm musically weak, when I'm getting, what am I, doing now? And then it's always to press a loop and start thinking, but it always got boring. So I sold the loop pedals. It was a conscious decision to sell them so that I can be challenged and can be on the edge of my seat and, not get lazy when I'm performing, which I mention right now because it's an important concept, that I'm coming back to when it comes to me performing with what in whatever concept, I'm, performing with. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Hans: </b>So I had these pedals, but again, after a short, period of time, those were out of the window because, the first thing that I have worked on in the two thousands was, was sample manipulation. And you can, of course, with a computer do way more things with sample man manipulation than what you can do with a loop pedal or any other kind of, pedal. Certainly, you know, what you can do with pedals is playing forwards backwards, higher and lower. But here what you cannot do is usually taking, certain parts of it and rearrange, a live plate material, and, and so on and process certain parts of the sample, with different parameters and so on. And I figured quickly also that I could control my parameters with my playing style, which you cannot do with pedals. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Hans: </b>And so this is where, where this whole thing became like interactives, a little bit. So that I say, it's not only the sounds that I create are the sounds that are, that are processed, but the sounds that are, are created by draw, getting some information from it, by analyzing it, are also the sounds that control the processing of the sounds. In fact, it's of course that the moment I play, now I process the sounds that I played, a second ago because I have to run into a buffer. So there's always some kind of a delay in there. Right. But this is a basic concept, how I started with that, that I control my sounds, the processing of my sounds with the sounds that I'm playing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, that's, that's really interesting. And that kind of rolls into something you talked about as like the areas of interest, which is dynamics, because one of the ways that you can really have an expressive kind of control system is by having a highly dynamic playing style and then a system mm-hmm. <affirmative> mm-hmm. <affirmative> that can respond to those high dynamics. So what, first of all, what are the kinds of things that you control with your playing style and with the dynamics, and how do you have to, how do you have to change your playing technique in order to pull it off? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Hans: </b>I always say, here I'm playing fiddle. I'm not playing guitar. I'm playing fiddle, but fiddle. Although there might, there are meanwhile other pitch and, velocity trackers out there, that's the core of my patch for 15 years now, and this is what I have the feeling I somehow control where, you know, it's like a certain amount of like banging on the guitar. I have a feeling that I understand the response to a certain point, and also how to deal with pitch. It's, I mean, I have tried a lot of things, but when it comes to analyzing sound, I'm mostly still going. I'm, I'm back to mostly using pitch and velocity to control thing. But let's say if you play, normal guitar sound a c that will be easily analyzed as a C but that's not the way I'll work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Hans: </b>If I have a pot scratcher that scratches on the strings, there's no discernible pitch in the traditional sense. It's just like some kind of noise that comes in. So <span style="color:red" data-ts="1498.5" data-end_ts="1498.72" title="1498.5" id=c_"1498.5">__fit__</span> will still derive some kind of a fundamental out of this crap that's coming in and saying, oh, this is a, F <span style="color:red" data-ts="1507.56" data-end_ts="1507.84" title="1507.56" id=c_"1507.56">__sharp__</span> or whatever, <laugh>. But, you know, this is really not so controllable, but I have the feeling that the way how I work with, my gadgets on my guitar after 15 years, I have some kind of a feeling and can predict what, will happen. Not exactly as, as I say, like there's an F Sharp, but, whether, for example, fiddle gives me a lot of crappy data that's coming out or and goes all over the place, or whether it's more steady stuff like this, I, I, I have a feeling for, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. I think for those people that aren't familiar with the Max Object fiddle, it's something that was developed by Miller <span style="color:red" data-ts="1553.76" data-end_ts="1554.08" title="1553.76" id=c_"1553.76">__Pocket__</span>. It, it's a pitch tracker, and it's a pitch tracker that just generates a ton of information about, about the, the data that it sees coming in through, say, a microphone. And, but as you say, if you feed it sort of nonsense material, it will try really, really hard to give you a pitch <laugh>. Right. But what I, what I think is interesting about that is that if you consciously try to make a pitch, you know, you're gonna pretty much hit it every time. And fiddle is going to pretty much detect it at the same every time. Yeah. Yes. But when you attack something with this kind of random noisiness stuff, every time you work with it, it's gonna give you different results. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Hans: </b>Yeah, exactly. Although the question is what is a different result? If I say like, oh, with my pot scratcher example, I know that it gives me totally a lot of data and all over the, frequency range, and as much as possible, this is something that I want to have at this, point of course. Right. And this is, if I want to have that, then it's predictable, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? Indeed. Well, you know, it's what's, I guess the reason I think of it in terms of predict of not predictable results is that it's sort of unpredictable in the same way that, like, say circuit bending is not predictable. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, you know, if you're doing circuit bending, when you go to kind of like, you know, lay a wet cloth on a certain part of the circuit, it'll react similarly, but it'll never give you the exact same squeals and farts and stuff. Right. <laugh>. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Hans: </b>Yeah. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. And so what it strikes me is that your use of fiddle is almost like a computer-based circuit bending 
</p>

<p>
<b>Hans: </b>Mm-hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative> because of the way that you approach it. That's really interesting. That's pretty cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Hans: </b>Yeah. But then there's also, I need to add here, and we are coming back, to another important thing. I wanted to, you know, explain with this article, where I wanna go into what is actually interactivity here, right? <span style="color:red" data-ts="1691.95" data-end_ts="1692.24" title="1691.95" id=c_"1691.95">__That__</span> I say that I program deliberately some, controlled randomness into the machine so that it surprises me constantly. And I am, as I said before, I'm sitting at the edge of my seat. I have to be, alert and awake to really, so that I stay, stay on top of, what I'm doing and not falling back into like the same routine over and over again. Going back here, towards the end of the nineties, I also, felt that my improvisations, were very predictable. You know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1729.8" data-end_ts="1730" title="1729.8" id=c_"1729.8">__if__</span> improvisation is just something that you say, I'm just not writing it down, and you have a finite amount of musical expressions, like in a toolbox, and it's just like you take your tools every time out of the box, but just you rearrange them every time, well, then it is an open form composition, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Hans: </b>That was okay. But in my case, it was also, it became boring. It, I think it became also boring for my listeners. And it is really, and it just would simply say it's a matter of personality. I can work very well with like, uncertainty with things that I have no idea how to solve a problem right now. And it actually in my music, is, clearly visible that if things happen, if problems arise, something breaks, if, something's happening that I do not immediately <span style="color:red" data-ts="1791.83" data-end_ts="1792.12" title="1791.83" id=c_"1791.83">__know__</span>, know how to handle, then my performance are actually getting better because it keeps me alert. So you could, of course, write a software that does exactly what you want all the time, but I know that in my case, it would get boring and predictable and I would repeat myself over and over again instead of having everything as controllable as possible. I put some controlled randomness into, the machine, so that, it is not always, doing what I want, but sometimes surprises me with some totally different outcome. And that helps. Sure. And I do <span style="color:red" data-ts="1833" data-end_ts="1833.28" title="1833" id=c_"1833">__also__</span> with other ensembles when I conduct my 16 piece chamber ensemble or my, my, 15 piece electronic ensemble or so, if things are happening that are mistakes or something, something's breaking, somebody does something unexpected, somebody does something that was, just a mistake or something, it's actually good. It always keeps me awake. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. I think that's really interesting, an interesting point because what it also shows is your development as an artist and how that kind of is different from the way other artists approach their craft. So, for a lot of musicians, one of the goals is to become good enough at, at your instrument and good enough at a style of music so that you can, you can play things without making mistakes. And as I think you identified, one of the things that happens is you lose the sense of risk. And when you lose the sense of risk, you, you start boring yourself. Yeah. And I, and I think that the audiences get toed into that immediately. I've always felt like audiences are at the peak of their attention when or at, at, at their peak when they're sitting on their edges of the seat wondering if you're gonna go down in a great big ball of flames. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Hans: </b><laugh>. Yeah. I think it is something that transpires through the room, you know, whether you're like, like another concert like this Snore Away Press Your Buttons, or if you're like alert if you are there and you know, the tension, is there and like the audience. I see it also when I'm at concerts. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. So let's talk a little bit about your, your ensembles, your large format ensembles. You have two of them, the third eye chamber orchestra and the Dark Circuits Orchestra. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. First of all, what's the difference between the two? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Hans: </b>The <span style="color:red" data-ts="1958.07" data-end_ts="1958.36" title="1958.07" id=c_"1958.07">__Dark__</span> Third Eye Orchestra is, the, ensemble of acoustic instruments, a chamber ensemble with life sound processing, which, Dafna is doing because she's specialized in that. Right. The other ensemble is all electronics mostly, or usually with people who built their own instruments. I find one of the most interesting things with electronic music performance is that we still have so many people who designed their instruments. And, but recently I had also David Watson back <span style="color:red" data-ts="1991.12" data-end_ts="1991.36" title="1991.12" id=c_"1991.12">__Pipe__</span> with it. So probably the Dark Circuits Orchestra will morph into all electronics with one acoustic instrument while the other one is, all acoustic with one electronic instruments. Both I, I see both have the, what I call myself, the third eye concept. I write the materials out for the entire ensemble for usually one hour performances, but these are all on individual, sheets of paper that are numbered with letters and numbers. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Hans: </b>And I improvise as somebody who puts these, calls these units in with flashcards and hand signs, which there's only like a few, you know, play E two and I count them in or something. So that it's a real open form composition in that, the material will be played, some of the material will be played several times, other material might not get played. Nobody knows how I start, how I end what's happening in the middle. And, but I improvise as the conductor and put it all together live, on stage. Again, this is the way for me to work because, if I write stuff out and I had that already with my jazz performances, if I write it all out, it gets boring already when I go on stage and I have to play it the second time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Now, the material that you're writing for people, is it standard notation or are you doing like graphical notation or do you mix and match, or do you do like Pauline Olivarez, like word style word poem work? <span style="color:red" data-ts="2092.83" data-end_ts="2093.12" title="2092.83" id=c_"2092.83">__Yeah__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Hans: </b>For the Chamber ensemble, it's all written, and arranged to the entire ensemble. Quarted, quarted, several keyboard synthesizer, then voice, and so on for the, electronic ensemble, it's graphic notation and sometimes words, that text that I wrote down with some telling them like, play a, field recording sample with natural sound, stuff like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see. Interesting. So it's, you know, in terms of like visualizing this in my head, when you talk about the Chamber ensemble, it's easy to imagine, you know, these different groupings and, and the pianos and the bass mm-hmm. <affirmative> and this kind of stuff, because we all recognize what those instruments are. With dark Circuits, you're saying that a lot of these things are sort of like personally built. How do you know even the capability of, the instruments that the players have so that you can write for or you can, 'cause even if you're improvising, you kind of have to do it in a way that honors the instrument that the person has in front of them. Right? Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Hans: </b>There are two, ways to handle it that I'm doing. First is, well, the Dark Circuits Orchestra has been mostly a workshop orchestra before, but now it's, orchestra of, more or less fixed, people who I know for a long time. And I, in most <span style="color:red" data-ts="2185.64" data-end_ts="2185.92" title="2185.64" id=c_"2185.64">__case__</span>, I played with them also for a long time, so I know what they're doing. This is one approach like Michel for <span style="color:red" data-ts="2191.84" data-end_ts="2192.12" title="2191.84" id=c_"2191.84">__Failed__</span> with <span style="color:red" data-ts="2192.4" data-end_ts="2192.56" title="2192.4" id=c_"2192.4">__this__</span> Light Bulbs. I played with this guy since 1992. Sure. Second, I meet with everybody beforehand, and before, when I did my large performance last year at I-Beam, I met with them for a long time discussing all the little details and asking them even some simple questions was like, how do you control your volume? Mm-hmm. Because if you work with <span style="color:red" data-ts="2218.08" data-end_ts="2218.52" title="2218.08" id=c_"2218.08">__<inaudible>__</span>, they have no idea, oh, should I control my volume? But Matthew, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2222.46" data-end_ts="2222.68" title="2222.46" id=c_"2222.46">__you__</span> gives you an answer like, oh, with my little pinky. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2226.47" data-end_ts="2226.76" title="2226.47" id=c_"2226.47">__Some__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Hans: </b>Motion controller to control stuff, or, you get it just like, really, you should look at the notes that I did when, when I talked to my people from this osso, what, what weird answers I got. And of course, some people do not do certain things. Some people do not do rhythms, others do not do Glee Sunday. So these, things have to be considered, and, you have to examine and interview everybody a long time beforehand and, and then write the score. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Okay. That's, that's why I asked, because like you mentioned, you know, one of the instructions might be to play a sample of a field recording of a nature sound, except if that, if that player doesn't have access to samples, you know, that would be a little rough. But I see what you're saying is, especially if, if you have an ensemble that's pretty much a set cast, they represent probably just about as stable of of groupings as your winds and your strings in the third eye orchestra. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Hans: </b>Exactly. And I mean, you approach, the string quoted differently than the base clarinets, in that section and here and the Dark Circuits orchestra, you approach the people <span style="color:red" data-ts="2303.72" data-end_ts="2303.88" title="2303.72" id=c_"2303.72">__who__</span> can do samples differently than the ones that are more in the circuit bendy kind of, area. Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. That's actually interesting, and it makes a lot of sense on how you could manage about the biggest electronic group I've heard of to date. So, well, we're just about on just about done with our time this evening, and I really appreciate you taking the time to talk to me. I am curious, because you are, to me, one of the people that really is on the front edge of a lot of experimentalism and also having, a really deep history so that there's a lot of depth to the work that you do. I'm curious what you see as the most fertile areas of exploration for the future. And I'm thinking kind of the near future rather than the way out future. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Hans: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2353.18" data-end_ts="2353.4" title="2353.18" id=c_"2353.18">__Oh__</span>, that's a good question. I have no idea. <laugh>. It's, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2361.92" data-end_ts="2362" title="2361.92" id=c_"2361.92">__can__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2362.24" data-end_ts="2362.36" title="2362.24" id=c_"2362.24">__<crosstalk>__</span>. That's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>A great, that's a great answer. I really appreciate that answer. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Hans: </b>First is I can give you of course my, my personal area where I, I need to go. And this is like, you know, really working more with my larger <span style="color:red" data-ts="2378.32" data-end_ts="2378.76" title="2378.32" id=c_"2378.32">__results__</span> right now. But in terms of like looking to the future, you know, my, my favorite story is the idea when people came up with, with airplanes. And of course when people came up with airplanes, it was became so clear that the nation states will disappear because we can now fly over the borders. And you and I know where this ended up, you put a machine gun on your, airplane and then, the whole, theories out on of the window. Right. And so then I'd like always, if I get asked like, how will the future look? That always comes to my mind. I had done so many predictions in my life was <laugh> turned out differently, you know, <laugh>. So I don't know, my students right now wanna work with <span style="color:red" data-ts="2425.48" data-end_ts="2425.6" title="2425.48" id=c_"2425.48">__a__</span> Mayo, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2426.43" data-end_ts="2426.72" title="2426.43" id=c_"2426.43">__Mayo__</span>, Mayo. So maybe there's still something to be done, in the area of, controlling your computer with anything else than the computer keyboard. I don't know. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You know, going back to your endangered guitar system a little bit, how, what are, what are the external controllers that you use to control the computer? I mean, when, when I look at the array of your playing area, you have a lot of things that you used for sort of prepared guitar type work, or like you said, the pot scrubbers and stuff like that. But <span style="color:red" data-ts="2462.38" data-end_ts="2462.6" title="2462.38" id=c_"2462.38">__you__</span> don't really, it doesn't seem like you have a big array of like controllers or anything. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Hans: </b>I had worked with, a bunch of controllers, on and off, which is, you could see like, Hey, you play AP for a while and then you don't play the piece anymore. I had for a while, I had an infrared sensor from infusion systems in front of, me that allowed me to turn things on and off with my head movements. That's what I used it for. I have used, accelerometers at the beginning. I have, I have experimented with a lead motion controller. I have done a lot with an iPhone, because an iPhone, if you put a metal case around it and use the accelerometer, it's like a very good bottleneck that you can use and then move around. But each one of these, you know, a year or two and then I got tired of it. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That seems to be, and, and maybe that is, that is a pointer for the future, which is that, it seems like with a lot of these controller systems, they do have a relatively short shelf life mm-hmm. <affirmative> because the, there's a difference between a, a controller box with knobs on it, or keys or buttons or pads and something like a guitar. There's, there's something about a guitar that, that screams instrument that no box of knobs seems to yet have captured. And, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Hans: </b>Yeah, it's a subtlety into it that you can't, can't get with anything with a box. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Is there anything that you've tried or you've felt, so as a guitarist especially, you're kind of tuned in to the feel of playing and the feel of, you know, of change. Is there anything that you've worked with that really struck you as saying, well, this could actually become an instrument? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Hans: </b>No, I, I could also add the connect, to my list and the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2595.5" data-end_ts="2595.72" title="2595.5" id=c_"2595.5">__qio__</span> that I'm still working with when I'm not using the guitar, but I process, somebody, somebody else. Okay. This is all, it's, it's, not the same. And then I was, experimenting with an iPad and the concrete performer, which is very interesting because it's like the old limo many years ago. Right. You can put all your 10 fingers on it and move. It's all cool, but, it's not still the subtlety that I'd like to have. I mean, at some point we have probably like brain controllers that really work, although with the brain controllers that I have worked in the past, they don't work with me because I don't seem to have a brain. There's nothing <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That's, I'm, I'm always afraid to use one of those because I'm scared to find out exactly how little, little activity there really is. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Hans: </b>Yeah. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I want to thank you so much again for the time. This was a fascinating, look into your work as well as, kind of the arc and vector of your, of your growth. And I think it's always interesting for people to hear how others go through that. 'cause it kind of informs us of possibilities for ourselves. So I want to thank you for opening those doors for us. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Hans: </b>Great. And thanks for having me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>All right. Well I will talk to you soon. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Hans: </b>Take care. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So that's Hans <span style="color:red" data-ts="2692.32" data-end_ts="2692.44" title="2692.32" id=c_"2692.32">__his__</span> story. I'm pretty sure he is sticking to it. I have a bunch of links for his stuff, including that article that I mentioned, from the prepared guitar. Please feel free to, check it out. It's on art music tech dot Libsyn, L I L I B S Y n.com. And you'll find the links there. I also, it's the links that you'll get if you check out the postings on Twitter or on Facebook. Thank you so much for listening. Keep on keeping on and keep on sharing this with your friends, family, enemies, whoever you can get to. Listen. That's great. And I will talk to you next week. Bye.
