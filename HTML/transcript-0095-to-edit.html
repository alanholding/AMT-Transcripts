<b>Darwin: </b>All right. This week I'm happy to, present somebody that we're gonna get to know together. Actually, that's not completely true. Yesterday I recorded an interview with this guy and, nothing recorded. So this is my second recording with him, your first thing that you're gonna get to hear. But it'll be great because, I really had a nice time talking with him yesterday. His name is Floran. He's, he's a friend of Todd Reynolds. Todd suggested that he would be a good, subject for a chat, and, I'm glad to talk to him. So, with that, I'll say hello to Flora. Flora, how are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Florent Ghys: </b>I'm good. Hello, Darwin I'm very happy to, to be a part of this podcast surrounded by so many amazing people. It's an honor to be here. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, it's, I feel really lucky that people will actually talk to me. So there's that 
</p>

<p>
<b>Florent: </b><laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. So why don't we start off by having you explain to people what you do? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Florent: </b>Okay. So I am, <span style="color:red" data-ts="73.845" data-end_ts="74.245" title="73.845" id=c_"73.845">__<inaudible>__</span>. I am come from France. I'm a composer, so I write music, for ensembles and performers for like classical and contemporary setups. I also composed music for, a few movies and documentaries. I, I'm also, double <span style="color:red" data-ts="95.875" data-end_ts="96.165" title="95.875" id=c_"95.875">__bass__</span>, player. So I, I have an education in double <span style="color:red" data-ts="99.635" data-end_ts="99.925" title="99.635" id=c_"99.635">__bass__</span>, classical, and a contemporary performance. I played double bass in a few EMS and orchestras. I'm also doing, weird experimental music, videos. So, I have absolutely no education in that, but I'm just having fun messing around with musical ideas and videos and, and for now I'm just doing that for, for myself. But, a friend of mine asked me to do the music video for a piece of him. So it's gonna be the first time that I'm gonna do video for a project that's not my music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Florent: </b>And also, as much <span style="color:red" data-ts="143.085" data-end_ts="143.205" title="143.085" id=c_"143.085">__I__</span>, as I, I have a hard time describing myself as a programmer, because I'm not a programmer. I'm not a coder. I don't really, write lines of code, so I don't feel good with that. But, I happened to have learned, max in 2007, 2009. I was working as a part-time, superintendent in a building. And I, I was bored and I would just like, did the tutorials by myself. And so, even though I, I still need to learn a lot, and I don't, I wouldn't say that I'm the best max programmer. I, I usually manage to make the stuff I want, work. So I've, I've done a few max patches for, for myself, for my music, for other people. And somehow a few years ago I tried to combine all these different things into a solo, for double <span style="color:red" data-ts="195.995" data-end_ts="196.285" title="195.995" id=c_"195.995">__base__</span> laptop and videos using Mac and playing my own music, and yeah. This is what I'm doing, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Yeah. Well, that's a lot of different things, and that's pretty exciting stuff. Let's talk a little bit about this combination of working with <span style="color:red" data-ts="215.105" data-end_ts="215.325" title="215.105" id=c_"215.105">__Max__</span> and I assume with a laptop and, 'cause the pictures I've seen of you use the laptop, and the double <span style="color:red" data-ts="223.445" data-end_ts="223.565" title="223.445" id=c_"223.445">__B__</span>, it seems like kind of an odd combo. What is it like just even interfacing those two tools? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Florent: </b>Yeah, that's an odd combo, but I, I think there's something I like about it. The idea of mixing like this old, wood instrument, that's been, you know, around for centuries and this like, totally new technology. The thing is, I also, I kind of like the idea of, not seeing the computer on stage and having the, the, the, the tech kind of disappear from the show, right? But at the same time, I have a sort of, how do you say, like maybe a, like an avatar of the computer, because I have this iPad, this tablet that's on my, on my double base, it's attached to it. So yeah, I put it with like this, you know, this paste where you, you, you can attach busters to a wall. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, yeah. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Florent: </b>So I just put that and it works great. And 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It doesn't, it doesn't harm the base. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Florent: </b>No, it doesn't, it doesn't hurt the, the varnish. It's, it's totally fine. Okay. So yeah, it's really like this mix of like, new technology with like, old technology. I really like it. And, and also what I like is that, it's kind of like a transparent, thing where, people can see what's going on on the iPad, even though they're not really gonna understand what's going on. There are like colors, there are dials turning. I have a metronome, stuff like that, that I like this idea of having a, a computer that's transparent because, you know, if you, if you go to see a, a solo laptop performance, unless you go on stage in the back of the guy, you don't really see what's going on on his screen and what he's doing. So I, I kind of like this idea of having a, a sort of computer that's disappearing, but still it's there and it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="350.205" data-end_ts="350.365" title="350.205" id=c_"350.205">__solely__</span> transparent and people can check out what's going on. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It seems to me like you're doing a lot to sort of break down some of the problem areas of, of doing laptop based performance. Because if nothing else, the, the double base, it's, it's big. It's imposing, it, it sort of like forces, forces itself into the, into the consciousness of the people watching you perform, right? Mm-Hmm. And, and also the, the sound, it makes almost as a physical nature to it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Florent: </b>Yeah. That's, that's something is like, I feel like doing a performance with a double base and a laptop is really not balanced because, because the double bass is a pretty big instrument with like, very low frequencies. And, and, yeah. I feel the computer can, can do like so many things. It's, I don't know. I like, I, yeah, I like being on stage with a, with my bass. I feel more comfortable being on stage solo with my bass than solo with a computer <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That makes sense. To what extent does the fact, I mean, I, you know, if I just put myself in your shoes with that, there's actually a lot of things that, that occur in that kind of environment that are probably comfortable. So not only is it an instrument that you've, you know, apparently spent a lot of time on, but also it's something that you kind of wrap yourself around. It sort of speaks through you through your own body, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, but you can also kind of hide behind it because it's so big. Yeah. And, you can shock people by, you know, the, the acoustic volume that it's able to produce. So I, I can imagine that there's a lot about working with that. That's kind of a, an additional comfort factor when you're doing performances. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Florent: </b>Yeah. I don't really think about it because it's just my instrument, so it's just what I'm doing. But yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Let's talk about that now. How did you, I mean, given all the things that you do, and we're gonna get into some more detail on that in a bit, but I'm curious about what is the road that you've taken to become the artist that you are? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Florent: </b>Okay. So I, I grew up, I, I, I come from Bordeaux in France. It's in the south of France. I grew up in this residential neighborhood in Bordeaux. Kind of boring, nothing really to do there, from a family of non-musicians at all. My parents really don't listen to music. They're listening to a lot of radio, though. They always have the radio on. And then I, I believe around like five, I began starting, I began studying, classical guitar, from five to 10 to, or 11, something like this. Then around 11, I I was listening to a lot of, like, I don't know, I had a poster of slash in my, like, the roses guitarist in my bedroom. I was listening to Nirvana and, and, and all these like, metal and hard rock bands. And so playing like Bach <span style="color:red" data-ts="555.395" data-end_ts="555.885" title="555.395" id=c_"555.395">__Manette__</span>, on the classical guitar didn't work for me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Florent: </b>So I switched to the electric guitar, which was much more fun at the time. And I had long hair, and I was playing in rock bands. That was also at the time where I was like a big, big, video game player. I played a lot of NES Nintendo Entertainment System. And, I think, I believe it's around when I was like, yeah, 12 or something that the Super Nintendo was released in France, and it was like a mind blowing thing for me. And then, I don't know when, <span style="color:red" data-ts="587.645" data-end_ts="587.925" title="587.645" id=c_"587.645">__when__</span> the bass player of, of of rock band I had was pretty bad, and I remember I had to show him the baselines, the, on the electric base. And, I remember liking it right away. I was like, I like this low frequencies, the role it has as being like the foundation of the piece of music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Florent: </b>So I began playing the electric bass, for a few years in like, jazz funk, rock bands and stuff like that. Right? That's, at the time also where I signed up for the computer music class at the conservatoire of Bordeaux at the time was pretty limited. But I was, I was really interested in the idea of like combining this like video games, thing and this attraction I had for computers with the music I was making, even, even though it was very limited, it was fascinating at the time. And then I went to the university, I went to Musicology, and I started, the, the classical, the upright bass, the double bass. I started to learn that I, I graduated a few years later with <span style="color:red" data-ts="662.085" data-end_ts="662.205" title="662.085" id=c_"662.085">__a__</span> master's in ethnomusicology where I worked on, Egyptian music. And then I decided to focus on double <span style="color:red" data-ts="670.155" data-end_ts="670.445" title="670.155" id=c_"670.155">__base__</span> performance. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Florent: </b>So I went to Paris, and, I really worked on like the classical repe repertoire and, orchestra playing and stuff like that. And then, yeah. And then I was in Paris and I was, I was kind of not super excited. It was like 10 years ago or something, 2004. I was about to get graduated. And, I was feeling a little isolated from the mu with the music I was beginning to do. And, and also I feel like the music scene at the time in Paris were, was very in, boxes. So you had to do classical or contemporary or electronic, but you couldn't do something that was in between. It was a real issue at the time. I discovered, bang <span style="color:red" data-ts="723.245" data-end_ts="723.445" title="723.245" id=c_"723.245">__on__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="723.485" data-end_ts="723.605" title="723.485" id=c_"723.485">__a__</span> can, the New York based organization, at the time on internet, I was just checking out. And, there are these three composers, David Lang, Michael Gordon, and, Julia Wolf, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Florent: </b>And I discovered their music. I was by myself in Paris, and I was like, wow, this is the best thing ever. I wanna meet these guys. And it happened that <span style="color:red" data-ts="747.565" data-end_ts="747.805" title="747.565" id=c_"747.565">__they__</span> had this summer festival, every year in Massachusetts at MassMoCa, and Steve Reich was the guest, and I was like, I need to go there, <laugh>. So I went there and it was like a, a real life changing experience because I met all these amazing people, amazing players who had exactly, not exactly, but like, kind of the same backgrounds as the one I had and everything. Everybody was happy. And, I was like, wow, this is, this is the place where I wanna be. So from, from that time, I, I was back and forth, between Paris, Bordeaux and New York. <span style="color:red" data-ts="785.525" data-end_ts="785.645" title="785.525" id=c_"785.525">__I__</span> was trying to go back, once a year or something. And then I decided a few years later, like four years ago, I decided to go back to school. And I had a master's at NYU Steinhardt, New York University Steinhardt, where I studied music composition with Julia Wolf. I graduated, two years ago, and now I'm doing a PhD at Princeton University. <span style="color:red" data-ts="811.105" data-end_ts="811.325" title="811.105" id=c_"811.105">__Woo__</span>. That was long 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Yeah. Well, but that's a, that's a heck of a trail that you're cutting there. A couple of questions. First of all, you didn't start learning base until you were in, at the university? Yeah, <span style="color:red" data-ts="825.175" data-end_ts="825.525" title="825.175" id=c_"825.175">__piece__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Florent: </b>I started around 19, 18. 19. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Florent: </b>19, I think. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>How hard was it? I mean, typically people, by the time they're in university, they already kind of have an instrument that is, they're instrument, and they're already pretty good at it. Yeah. It seems a little odd that you would start that late. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Florent: </b>Yeah, I know. I mean, it's not that odd for double <span style="color:red" data-ts="851.795" data-end_ts="852.085" title="851.795" id=c_"851.795">__base__</span>. Usually double <span style="color:red" data-ts="853.325" data-end_ts="853.605" title="853.325" id=c_"853.325">__base__</span> is an instrument. You can start late. But, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Why is that, why, why is that particularly 
</p>

<p>
<b>Florent: </b>The case? I think, I mean, <span style="color:red" data-ts="862.725" data-end_ts="862.925" title="862.725" id=c_"862.725">__there__</span>, there are some kids starting the double base, but it's not very, it's not the most, rewarding instrument when you're a kid. Yeah. And, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Also it's probably physically demanding too. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Florent: </b>Yeah. It's pretty physical, so I, I, I believe it's why, <span style="color:red" data-ts="879.485" data-end_ts="879.805" title="879.485" id=c_"879.485">__white__</span> people can start later. But yeah, for me, I had, I had issues because I had to pick up an instrument from the conservatoire, and I was, at the time, I remember I had dreadlocks, and I was, I was playing the electric guitar. I was playing flamenco on the, on the guitar. I was playing <span style="color:red" data-ts="897.965" data-end_ts="898.245" title="897.965" id=c_"897.965">__both__</span> Anova. I was playing the electric bass. I was playing the djembe, the DJJ <span style="color:red" data-ts="903.025" data-end_ts="903.245" title="903.025" id=c_"903.025">__do__</span>, I was doing weird computer stuff. And, nothing was really working in a, in a classical conservatoire at the time. So I went back doing like what I've done when I, when I was a kid, was, which was classical guitar, but I don't know, something was not really working for me. And, and I figured that I could start this instrument and actually go pretty fast because I, I already played a few instruments and I, I was already a musician for a few years, so I could actually catch up and, go pretty fast at it. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So you eventually, focused on ethno musicology? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And you said that, that your kind of specialty was Egyptian music. <span style="color:red" data-ts="949.035" data-end_ts="949.325" title="949.035" id=c_"949.035">__Yeah__</span>. Which I have to admit, I don't think I know any Egyptian music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Florent: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. So what does that mean, and what effect did that music maybe have on you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Florent: </b>I don't, I don't know what effect it has on me. I think it, it happens on a, on the lower level thing where, you know, you, you listen to a lot of things and somehow you digest these things, and somehow it comes out maybe unconsciously in the music. So I'm not really thinking about like, quoting Egyptian music <span style="color:red" data-ts="983.815" data-end_ts="984.165" title="983.815" id=c_"983.815">__night__</span> pieces. Okay. But maybe some stuff happens. I'm, I'm not sure, should definitely check out Egyptian music. They're very beautiful things in the, in the seventies and eighties was like the golden age of Egyptian music. Cairo was like the center, the art center of the Arabic world. They are like tons of amazing singers and composers writing this like hour <span style="color:red" data-ts="1010.475" data-end_ts="1010.765" title="1010.475" id=c_"1010.475">__long__</span> pieces for orchestra and singers incorporating like electric guitars and, and quarter tones on the violins. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="1019.585" data-end_ts="1019.805" title="1019.585" id=c_"1019.585">__you__</span>, there're like really, really beautiful works. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. What are, what are the things that make Egyptian music unique with the use of electric guitars and stuff? Maybe it's changing now. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But, what's, what are the things that, that you could kind of hang your hat on from an ethno musicologist's standpoint? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Florent: </b>Yeah. What I, what I was really interested in is that I don't, I don't really know, what's going on today in, in Egyptian music at all. But what's in, what was interesting for me is that, traditionally Egyptian music, and Arabic music was just one melody, a monody or, homopho, I think we call that, where everybody's playing the same melody at the same time. Right. But it's approximately the same melody, in the way that there are improvised ornaments. So everybody's kind of playing the same thing at the same time, but it's not exactly the same thing. So it's like this thick melody. So that's like the traditional Arab Arabic music or Egyptian music. And somehow it, it like, transformed into a more western system with harmonies and chords. And, and somehow the baseline played a part in that transition from a monod to a harmony world by becoming independent, the best baseline, implied harmonies. And, so I, I, yeah, I, I was interested in like the, this transition and how the base played a role in that transition. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, that's really interesting. I, the one thing that I have heard of or kind of studied in the past that kind of had that mechanism was, the changing, the changing music of Jamaica and how it became reggae through sort of like this influence of western music <span style="color:red" data-ts="1142.795" data-end_ts="1143.085" title="1142.795" id=c_"1142.795">__Yeah__</span>. Uhhuh <affirmative>, but how they also use some of their own sort of like, unique perspectives and unique, indigenous musics to sort of, make, make a very unique end result. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Florent: </b>Yeah. That's, that's very fascinating. I think that's, I mean, for me, that's, that's something that's the best in, in the, globalization. It's, it's that, the acculturation, it's when a culture takes something from another culture and makes it, its its own and, and is going to use like Western instrument, but in a different way. Right. It's really, and it's interesting too, because I remember at the time when I was working in ethnomusicology, that's something that's really not valid, because as soon as there was like electric guitars or synthesizers in Egyptian music, ethnomusicologists would stop studying <laugh> saying, this is not Egyptian music anymore. This is bad music. And I was like, no, it's been there for like 20 years now. Maybe we could consider it and we should analyze this music too, you know? And it's, and it's actually very interesting because they're using synthesizers with quad <span style="color:red" data-ts="1218.275" data-end_ts="1218.565" title="1218.275" id=c_"1218.275">__tone__</span> and stuff like that. So why not analyzing this too. And, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That is such an amazingly sort of like western view of things, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, which is like, you know, we really want those primitive people to stay primitive. Well, nobody themselves actually wants to stay primitive. They just want other people to do it. Right. So you say that you don't think that it's, it's really affect you or no, more than other kinds of music? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Florent: </b>Yeah. I don't, I don't know know. I've, like, one of the basis of, Egyptian music is to use quad tones and these maccombs, which are these, modes, scales they're using. And I'm, I've never used that in my music. So, yeah, I don't know. It's, it's hard for me. I'm, I, I, sure, I think I'm not thinking really about what I'm doing. I'm just doing the things I'm doing. And then maybe after a few months or years I can actually be like, oh, I totally still steal that, that idea from this piece, you know? But I, I don't really realize it right away. Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1282.705" data-end_ts="1282.925" title="1282.705" id=c_"1282.705">__So__</span>, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So you said that now you are, at Princeton, studying for a PhD. What's, what's, what's got you interested in doing a PhD? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Florent: </b>
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Because it seems, looking at your resume, it seems like you're doing a lot of stuff that people want <span style="color:red" data-ts="1300.125" data-end_ts="1300.205" title="1300.125" id=c_"1300.125">__to__</span> do. You're composing, working with the bang of the can people and others, you are doing soundtracks and all this stuff. It seems like you're already in the game. What, what is it about a PhD that's going to enhance that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Florent: </b>Yeah, I already spend a lot of time in schools and yeah, I, I don't really need to spend more time in school. You're right. But at the same time, I've, I've spent a, a few years outside of school and I was, as I was saying earlier, I, I had this feeling of being very isolated and, when I was in France, so I moved to New York, and what I'm really enjoying here is to be surrounded by all these amazing teachers we have. And the students are pretty awesome to, everybody's like doing his own thing. And it's, it's a great energy. It's very inspiring when you get stuck, you can talk to people. You have these facilities where, we have a few recording studios that are open 24 7. It's just like three minute walk from my place. So it's just an ideal situation for just not spending time with boring stuff and just focusing on, on your art. And, it's, it's just ideal. It's, it's almost like a dream. I feel like I'm in, I'm in a, a weird <laugh> place where everybody's happy and everybody's doing great things. And, it's, it's pretty good. I'm really enjoying that. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>At Princeton too, you have some access to some of the nicer people in the composition and electronic music world. I mean, Dan Truman's just a wonderful guy to work around anyway. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1405.965" data-end_ts="1406.255" title="1405.965" id=c_"1405.965">__Yeah__</span>. And, Jeff Snyder's there right now, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Florent: </b>Yep. He's, he's there too. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>He's, he's an incredibly talented and, and interesting guy as well. So I can, I can see where you can get a lot of inspiration from that. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But now Princeton isn't, that's in New Jersey, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Florent: </b>Yes, it is. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>How far from the city, how from new, from New York are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Florent: </b>It's like an hour and a half south. It's, it's halfway between halfway between New York and Philly. Oh, okay. Yeah. An hour, an hour and a half, depending if you're driving or taking the train. I see. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. That's not so bad then. And, and boy, if you want a place where you're not gonna be isolated, New York is gonna be it. Yeah. You're gonna be able to find a thousand people of, into whatever you are, no matter what you're into. I think. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But, that's fantastic. So how are, how do you find it to be, you know, having come from France and, and kind of dropping in New York, how difficult was it for you to establish yourself in that environment when it is kind of an aggressive place in terms of, you know, people want to work with the best people, that's why they're there. How, how hard was it get to get established in the city? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Florent: </b>I don't, I don't know. I think it was, it was harder for me in France, and even though in Paris, it's in, in New York, it's, it's stuff. And there are like so many people very talented doing a lot of things. I always felt there is something very cra encouraging about New York people. I don't know. There people are nice and like encouraging and nobody really caress about where you're coming from or what studies you've done. It's more about, I mean, it's more like the American way of like, show me what you're doing and if I like it, you know, that it's great. In Paris, it's more like, who are you? Who did you study with? Oh, yeah. And if, if that's cool, I might listen to what you do. I mean, I'm talking also like Paris like 10 years ago. So Yeah. It sounds like it's, it's changing a little bit too nowadays. But yeah, there is something I really enjoyed in New York <span style="color:red" data-ts="1534.665" data-end_ts="1534.885" title="1534.665" id=c_"1534.665">__is__</span> this idea of accessibility. Or you can go to a concert or a show and then talk to the guys, even if they're like super famous and usually they talk to you, which is pretty awesome. And, it never happened to me in Paris, for example, where if you're not introduced or if you're not in a circle of people, it's, it's harder I feel to get in touch with the artists. And, so yeah. I don't know if I really answered your question. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, sort of, I mean, it, it's interesting 'cause I hadn't thought about it that way, but the different environments, you know, depending on how, how much people respect like authority and bureaucracy, that's gonna change the way that they interact when a new guy shows up. And, and certainly in New York, my experience is there as well, have been that if you can do something, well, people wanna talk to you about it and find out about what you can do, and maybe you can collaborate or maybe you can help them with something, or maybe they just wanna see what you're doing. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But it does seem to be a very open from that standpoint. You don't have to have, you don't have to show your credentials Yeah. Before you show your work. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Florent: </b>Exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And that's pretty, that's pretty encouraging. So do you still, do you still get into the city pretty often? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Florent: </b>Yeah, I do. I, I fight, I take the shuttle, the New Jersey Transit with my double base and <laugh> the subway stairs, and yeah, I'm doing that pretty often. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That, that's gotta be a trip hauling that around on the train. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Florent: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1627.925" data-end_ts="1628.215" title="1627.925" id=c_"1627.925">__Yeah__</span>. Thinking about getting a car, but I don't have a car yet, so I'm just taking the train. <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Does, have you thought about like finding some like incredibly tiny base to use instead? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Florent: </b>Do I actually do have a, a travel base, which is a, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1646.655" data-end_ts="1646.775" title="1646.655" id=c_"1646.655">__a__</span> like a stick? Oh, yeah. Yeah. That, that fits in a sort of like, golf bag. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Florent: </b>But I don't know, the idea of it is great. It's like a foldable neck, right? It's, it's actually pretty small and pretty light. And, I like the idea of it, but <laugh> then, playing it is just a different thing. Sure. I don't, I don't like playing it. I don't, I don't feel the same things. I don't, I don't, I I never find a way to get the sound, so it doesn't really have any base. So I, I need to, to, to put up with that and like add more bass in my pickup. And I never managed to find a good sound either, so I don't, I don't know. I, I like the idea of it, but it's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Not, the reality isn't there. Right. Yeah. That's kind of funny. I, I have to admit that I have tried using some of these kind of travel instruments. I was guitarist for a long time. Yeah. And I tried, a number of these instruments that were gonna be conceivably easier to travel with. And the problem was, for me at least, the complete lack of any feeling of resonance to my body. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> just made it felt like I was, it felt like I was playing the instrument from across the room. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Florent: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Didn't seem like I could connect to it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Florent: </b>Yeah. It's, it's interesting. I, I hadn't played the, the electric bass in <span style="color:red" data-ts="1738.015" data-end_ts="1738.135" title="1738.015" id=c_"1738.015">__a__</span>, in maybe a few years or something. And I, I plugged an electric bass the other day, and, for me, the first reaction was exactly what you're describing was that the sound was coming from the amp <laugh>. And it was so weird for me that the sound didn't come from the instrument itself. I mean, it's coming, but the, the, that's, that was interesting, this idea that the source, the, the sound source is not coming from the instrument. I was like, so different. This is so different. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. So now I, I'm, there's another thing I want to kind of quiz you on, which I'm really curious about. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you said that, you were not trained as a programmer or really kind of as a technologist at all. Yeah. But you've sort of, you got a job, a part-time job as a super in a building. You were bored and you learned Max. That sounds like, that sounds like a very improbable tale. <laugh> It also sounds like an interesting one. How did you just, you know, because a lot of people first learn max through a class in university or something like that. Yeah. Or now there are a couple of really good books out that can kind of help you get started, especially from a musical perspective. But I'm curious, what was it like, what was it like learning this kind of in isolation, but also how did you, how did you decide what, what to learn? Because with Max, there's 700 things you can learn. Yeah. And picking the picking one or the other is actually kind of a lot of work. How did you make those decisions? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Florent: </b>For me it's, it's, first, it's, it's because of a friend of mine, Flo, who is a, a composer based in Paris. I was, at the time, I was using a Bolton Live was like maybe 10 or 11, 12 years ago, something like that. Okay. I was using Aon Live and, I believe it was Live four or something, which was pretty limited. And there were like a lot of things I wanted to do that I couldn't really do in live. And this friend of mine, Floran came to me and he wrote that piece for double bass and electronics that I played several times. And it involved <span style="color:red" data-ts="1875.965" data-end_ts="1876.085" title="1875.965" id=c_"1875.965">__a__</span>, a max <span style="color:red" data-ts="1876.615" data-end_ts="1876.965" title="1876.615" id=c_"1876.615">__batch__</span>. And it was the first time I actually saw a max <span style="color:red" data-ts="1880.765" data-end_ts="1881.085" title="1880.765" id=c_"1880.765">__batch__</span>. And, and I began like editing it and checking out and asking him questions about it and being like, okay, but if I, if I press the pedal and can I have like a decrescendo after 10 seconds? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Florent: </b>And then it stopped the samples, it was like, sure, look, <laugh>, blah, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1899.605" data-end_ts="1899.805" title="1899.605" id=c_"1899.605">__blah__</span>. I was like that. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1901.465" data-end_ts="1901.685" title="1901.465" id=c_"1901.465">__It__</span> was another mind blowing experience for me. Like all in a sudden I, like, it totally changed the way I was thinking about, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1910.995" data-end_ts="1911.285" title="1910.995" id=c_"1910.995">__comp__</span> using computers because everything sounded free and I was free to do whatever I want. And this idea of building something to, this idea that I've, I've never built any objects or anything. And on, in <span style="color:red" data-ts="1926.685" data-end_ts="1926.805" title="1926.685" id=c_"1926.685">__the__</span> sudden I had the power to, I mean, I had to learn before, but I, I could have the power to, to build, things on the computer. And it was, yeah. It was pretty, impressive. So at first I kind of like tried to just reuse the patch he did, and like copy and paste and make it bigger. And, and then I was like, okay, I, I really need to understand, deeply what's going on. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Florent: </b>And so I just started with, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1959.395" data-end_ts="1959.685" title="1959.395" id=c_"1959.395">__with__</span> just like, I think it's the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1960.845" data-end_ts="1961.005" title="1960.845" id=c_"1960.845">__tutorial__</span>, the, the first tutorial. It's like, I just started in the order Max, and then I did MSP, and then I did a few years later, jitter. Right. And then, yeah. I don't, I don't know. I've, I've always been also very interested in, that's a project I'm, I'm still working on. And the idea of using, max as a, as a composition tool, as a, a way to create media material Oh, I see. Right. For compositions, I'm using that a lot, like random <span style="color:red" data-ts="1994.795" data-end_ts="1995.085" title="1994.795" id=c_"1994.795">__note__</span> generators, but like kind of elaborated random note generators where you can control the density and like the scales and stuff like that. And, I'm also work working with, the library back, or B 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yes. The back library. Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Florent: </b>The music notation stuff. Yes. And I'm really interested in the idea of doing a real <span style="color:red" data-ts="2016.405" data-end_ts="2016.645" title="2016.405" id=c_"2016.405">__time__</span> composition stuff where performers would, sight read the music that's generated in real time. Right. Stuff like that. So I, I began with, with Max and, and then I, I was like, okay, now I know Max and I, I, I'm gonna try to do what I was doing in life, but in Max, and then I, I learned, MSPI still <span style="color:red" data-ts="2041.005" data-end_ts="2041.285" title="2041.005" id=c_"2041.005">__have__</span> a lot of things to learn and a lot of things that I don't really understand yet, but I'm getting better. <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>One of the things that I find it's really kind of peculiar among musicians and artists is that they get frustrated when they talk about doing programming or coding because they feel like, well, I don't know, there's a lot of things I don't know. So that makes me not accomplished at programming. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But if you talk to them about their instrument or about music composition or whatever, they're more than happy to say there are 10,000 avenues in composition. And I know a few of 'em that I really enjoy. And so I focus on that. You know, it's sort of like for composition, it's okay not to know everything, but in programming, somehow that's not acceptable. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Florent: </b>Yeah, you're right. I don't, I don't know what, what it is about it. There's something, maybe the opposite is true to, we should ask, a programmer who's not a composer, <laugh>. Yeah. If it's, if it's the same feeling, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2109.145" data-end_ts="2109.365" title="2109.145" id=c_"2109.145">__but__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>If it's Right. That's a, that's actually a great point, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Florent: </b>I feel, yeah. For me, there is something very impressive because I'm always, I don't know, there is something about confidence, and the more you do something, the more confident you get about it. And then you can just, like, even like me, when you <span style="color:red" data-ts="2126.245" data-end_ts="2126.445" title="2126.245" id=c_"2126.245">__asked__</span> me at the beginning of this talk, what I was doing, just me saying that I'm doing videos, it's kind of a new thing, and it's something I've, I've been doing for years. It's just that now I feel a little more confident doing videos because I worked a lot on it. And I'm, I'm like, okay, I can say I'm doing videos. Right. And I think it's the same thing with programming. It's like, it's so big and so impressive, and they're like all these words and all these like technical things related to the way the computer works. And there are a lot of things that at first it's, yeah. It's like, it's very impressive. And, and when you do your first max batch that works, you, you don't say I'm a programmer. You're like, oh, I don't really know how, but I make this work. You know? And, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well that is, that is a great point, which is that you have to kinda work yourself up to being, to, to being willing to call yourself a programmer. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Florent: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Or whatever. It's also, to me, it's really fascinating to hear that you actually started with Max by working with someone else's Max Patch. Yeah. Which, I think that that's unusual, but maybe it's not unusual for you because, you know, one of the things that we keep on reiterating when we talk about stuff is this desire not to work in isolation. You like working with other people and interacting with them. And, and in fact, with some of your Max patching, you've actually done max patching for other people as part of their work, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah. So that's, that's kind of interesting that you found a way to make programming, or at least max patching you find <span style="color:red" data-ts="2230.925" data-end_ts="2231.045" title="2230.925" id=c_"2230.925">__a__</span>, found a way to make it sort of a social part of your life. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Florent: </b>I mean, for me, I really had to see, max in action for me to be willing to spend that time to learn it. Sure. I, I already had a few years before I had like an introduction to Max, and as, as much as I totally loved this introduction, it was too abstract. And I was, I was like, I'm not a programmer. It's too much work for me. I'm a musician. I don't have time to do this. And then I, it's really when my friend like, put this patch on my computer and I was with my computer checking this out, and I, I really had to see it with my eyes. Right. And then when I saw it, I was like, I realized all the possibilities that, that could, that, that I could do with it. And, but I had to see it with my eyes. And then, I don't know, I spent a lot of time on internet, on the forum, on the, just asking questions and, and, and asking my friends too. I have a few friends who work in <span style="color:red" data-ts="2296.665" data-end_ts="2296.885" title="2296.665" id=c_"2296.665">__Max__</span> as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So let's talk a little bit about your explorations into video. How, so one of the things that's interesting to me is that when I look on your website and I do a little research on you, sort of your interaction with video is kind of a, is kind of a big, big deal. You know, it's, it's getting notice. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, or at least it seems to me. What, how long have you been working with video? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Florent: </b>It's been, something like 10 years or something. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Florent: </b>Yeah. I don't know. Like I, I began like 10 years ago doing weird, stuff with weather reports. And using the speech melody where you use the, the inflections, the inflection of the speaking language to, to build a piece of music, I, I used that. And, but at the time, like it was hard to do videos on, on the laptop, and now it's getting much better. So, I'm doing more things now. What was your question again? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I mean, so no, you answered the question, which is how long you been working with it? How long have you been performing now with it? Because <span style="color:red" data-ts="2370.145" data-end_ts="2370.565" title="2370.145" id=c_"2370.145">__videos__</span> kind of a part of your performance, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Florent: </b>Yeah, it's a very new thing. It's, so I released my, my album television, in November, and I began playing this, these pieces in November. So it's, it's only been a few months, that I'm, I'm doing this with videos in real, yeah. On the live performance. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Now, one of the things that's I always find fascinating is how people cross over from one kind of media art to another. So you're a very accomplished musician and composer and stuff. What is, how hard did you find the transition to the visual world and, what's been the reception of people to this, to this work? I, I tend to find that people who are coming at video from sort of a music background actually tend to do very interesting work. 'cause they have a different perspective on the value of video, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Florent: </b>Yeah. Exactly. I think for me, I, I really enjoy, working on videos because I feel like a kid playing with toys and, I'm not really thinking about what I'm doing. I'm just doing experiments and I'm having fun. And I don't feel the weight of history that sometimes I feel because I, I, when I write music, because I studied a lot music, you know, when you have to write a string quartet and you spend all these years studying music history, you know, about what's been written before, and it, you always have this kind of like, pressure, pressure of what can I do to make this string quartet interesting? Or to make this string quartet mind and all these like considerations. I really like the, the playful aspect of, playing with the media. You actually don't really know and you are learning it at the same time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Florent: </b>And I'm coming up with all these ideas and things and, and I have a few friends who are filmmakers, and when it's, they see my videos, they always see like the bad things and they're like, oh, this is, this is, the focus is bad and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2508.925" data-end_ts="2509.125" title="2508.925" id=c_"2508.925">__the__</span> <laugh> is bad, and the idiots are going way too fast. And, and I'm like, in a way, you know, I'm, I'm, as much as I really want to get better and improve in videos and learn more, I also don't really care. I'm just doing the stuff I want. And, I'm really enjoying that idea of playing with, with the media that I don't really know that much. Right. Has like a fresh, aspect to it. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You get to kind of find your own naive voice too, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> instead of, instead of, like you said, having to have everything weighed down with the centuries of history. That's cool. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2549.955" data-end_ts="2550.245" title="2549.955" id=c_"2549.955">__Yeah__</span>. So, we've already burned through our time. It's okay. Unreal. But, before we go, I do want to ask you, a question that I like to ask people, which is, if you could meet like a 18 year old version of yourself, what would you tell that person to make? Either make things easier or make things more focused, or maybe make things harder? I don't know, but what, what would you say to somebody in order to help them on their way? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Florent: </b>It's, it's, it's a hard question because I feel like times have changed so much since I was 18 that it's not the same world we're living now. But, I think I would say be yourself. Don't try to copy, don't try to copy things and just try to be yourself and be happy in what you're doing. I think that's the main thing I would say to myself or to someone who's 18 or 20. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That's great advice. Well, Floran, thank you so much for your time. Where can people go to find your work? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Florent: </b>I have, I have a website, Flo, F-L-O-R-E-N-T, GHY s.com. It's my name. There are like, a lot of things on my website.

And that'll have routes to like, 'cause I ran into some of your work on YouTube. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, which I found really cool. All that stuff is all linked from your site, right? <span style="color:red" data-ts="2636.925" data-end_ts="2637.215" title="2636.925" id=c_"2636.925">__Yeah__</span>.

It was really interesting particularly to, to hear about how he thinks of both working with the base as well as working anew with, with the medium of video. So thanks for that. Thanks to you for listening. I hope you enjoyed. If you have any ideas for people that I should interview, I've been getting emails about it. I'm sorry if I haven't got back to you, but don't think I'm not reading 'cause I am. But send me your ideas or particularly if you yourself think you should be interviewed, drop me a line and I'll reach out to you. Thanks a lot. And I'll talk to.
