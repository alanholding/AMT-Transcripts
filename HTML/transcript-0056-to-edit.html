<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Happy post Thanksgiving turn of the, month and almost new year, kind of, day. I am sitting here in my, dad's study after having consumed way too much Turkey, and, getting a chance to talk to somebody who I'm really excited to talk to. His name is Brian Funk He goes by the name of Afro DJ Mack. And I think if you are in the Ableton world, you absolutely know who this is. If you're not, you're probably gonna want to go and do a little digging, because he has done an amazing sets of tutorials and, of content. I got to know him a little more directly through my friend Mark Moser, who introduced us and strongly suggested that, that Brian be a part of the interviews. And the more I dug, the more excited I was to do it. So, with that, I introduced you to Brian Funk Hey, Brian. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian Funk (AfroDJMac): </b>Hi. How you doing? <span style="color:red" data-ts="71.72" data-end_ts="71.96" title="71.72" id=c_"71.72">__Darn__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm doing great. How did you do for Thanksgiving? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>I did very well, kept it at home. My girlfriend Courtney created a masterpiece of a dinner, which, you know, I, of course gorged myself on. And, everyone was happy. Everyone was thrilled. It was, it was a great experience, you know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's cool. Yeah. Did you, I'm surprised it's Black Friday and you aren't running around shopping like a 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b><laugh>. You know what, that's like exactly the opposite of what I wanna be doing. The stores to begin with <span style="color:red" data-ts="105.42" data-end_ts="105.64" title="105.42" id=c_"105.42">__are__</span>, you know, I kind of get overwhelmed with, yeah. Black Friday is like that feeling times a hundred. So <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's the antithesis of how you wanna live your life. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Oh, yeah. I've like Amazon Prime, you know, I, I'd much rather sit in my house and just, you know, let it come to me. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I hear <span style="color:red" data-ts="121.76" data-end_ts="121.92" title="121.76" id=c_"121.76">__you__</span> <laugh>. So, you mentioned in our, pre-interview that you actually, listened to the podcast. I am, quite honored for that to be the case. But that means you probably know how this starts off, which is, my first question is always is for you to tell me a little bit about your background and kind of the things that have made you the artist that you are, but also let us know what it is that is, you know, represents your current work and the kind of things that you're most proud of as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Okay, great. Yeah, I love the podcast, so this is an exciting experience for me as well. So I started playing guitar when I was about 14 years old. My friend Mike showed me how to play Enter Sandman on the guitar <laugh>. And to be honest, at that point in my life, it never occurred to me that if I got a guitar, I could learn those songs that I heard on the radio. I don't know if like rock stars were just like so much larger than life to me that it just seemed something that was out of my, you know, realm of possibilities. But, it blew my mind. And, I was hooked ever since. And, you know, we played music together all the time. And, we were in bands, rock bands throughout high school, and that's where I really spent most of my time was rock music, indie Rock, Beatles, Nirvana's, the stuff I learned on. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>And I guess what really got me into, where I'm now is I, I loved recording, you know, I, I got my first four track tape recorder, this little <span style="color:red" data-ts="213.21" data-end_ts="213.56" title="213.21" id=c_"213.21">__Tacan__</span> port Studios, right. I loved putting sound together and, all along, you know, kind of craving for like, the capabilities of a professional studio. We had eight <span style="color:red" data-ts="224.84" data-end_ts="225.04" title="224.84" id=c_"224.84">__app__</span> machines for a little while, we got off of eBay and, playing in bands all along. And I think it was really like listening to the Beatles and how they would take, you know, unusual sounds, and turn 'em into musical instruments and melodic components to their music that got me into experimenting with electronic music. So once, you know, I, I sold regrettably, I sold a 24 channel, task <span style="color:red" data-ts="252.22" data-end_ts="252.44" title="252.22" id=c_"252.22">__and__</span> mixer to get my first laptop. And that's when I got into, <span style="color:red" data-ts="257.68" data-end_ts="257.8" title="257.68" id=c_"257.68">__I__</span> started with Pro Tools, moved through Logic, and went up with Ableton Live. Just what really got me with Ableton Live was the ease of, creating my own sounds and instruments. And I just went to towns sampling everything I could think of pots and pans and, you know, all the way up to just like, lawnmowers and whatever made noise. And that's just endlessly fascinating to me 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right now. When, when I look at your site, and for those of you who <span style="color:red" data-ts="288.44" data-end_ts="288.52" title="288.44" id=c_"288.44">__are__</span> listening, that's Afro dj mac.com will, sort of like introduce you to the work that, that Brian's been doing. It seems like you're really focused on instrument building, and that kind of aligns with what you just said. What is it about creating an instrument in Ableton that that's more, I don't know, that, that you find more interesting than doing it in like contact or something like that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>I think it's just, it's a very like, easy experience for me. I, I had a little bit of time I spent doing it with logic, right. And, it was a lot of fun, but it felt very like mathematical and computery plugging in numbers for the loops start and the loops and, you know, and it, it's just, I just found doing it in live was really, quick, simple, and I got results much faster. That that's really all it was, I suppose, was just the, getting to the results faster. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Now, you've also in, in looking over the list of the things that you've worked on, there's a lot of retro machine mm-hmm. <affirmative> machinery that you play with, and particularly stuff that wouldn't prototypically be called great sounding. Yeah. <laugh>, you know, so you do a lot of things like with old, Casio type <laugh>, devices. And, I don't know, it, you have one that's called the, super eight <span style="color:red" data-ts="382.9" data-end_ts="383.12" title="382.9" id=c_"382.9">__Bit__</span> live pack, which I think is, I, I just love those kind of sounds and I think it's really cool that you latched into 'em. What is it about sort of the low tech, low fidelity stuff that, that interests you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Well, probably a lot of things. I think one of the biggest ones is nostalgia. I grew up playing more video games than I will probably ever admit, <laugh> too, you know, <laugh>, you know, red Eyes and sore thumbs, right? But, <span style="color:red" data-ts="415.7" data-end_ts="415.92" title="415.7" id=c_"415.7">__you__</span> know, my parents would probably, roll their eyes at me for that, <span style="color:red" data-ts="418.6" data-end_ts="418.8" title="418.6" id=c_"418.6">__but__</span> they were always trying to get me outside and <span style="color:red" data-ts="420.44" data-end_ts="420.56" title="420.44" id=c_"420.44">__that__</span>, not that I didn't hang out outside, but, you know, video games were huge growing up, so there's a lot of nostalgia to those sounds. So, that's definitely what got the video game stuff going. And, as far as like the cheap keyboards, the Cassio and stuff, I've always kind of found like, I guess there's always a place for everything, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>And, you know, if you have everything recorded, pristinely, I guess this goes back to when we first started getting our real studio equipment, me and a couple friends, we'd get a nice microphone, we'd be able to record things really nice, and you start layering all these nice recordings together, and then maybe we would grab like a cheap Radio Shack microphone or record something else, and it just gave it its place in the mix. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>It's funny how, you know, it's not so much that there's good and bad sounds, it's like appropriate sounds. And I found like sometimes I have this $100 Cassio or Yamaha keyboard that you get, you know, from like Costco or something that I got when I was probably about 15 years old. And some of the drum sounds are just so cool. They just have like a vibe and a life to them. And for me, starting out with like the tape machines, the four <span style="color:red" data-ts="500" data-end_ts="500.24" title="500" id=c_"500">__track__</span> cassette recorders always longed for the clean professional studio sound. And now that I have it, I kind of miss some of the magic that would happen on my four track tape recorder, <laugh>, you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Know? Yeah. I know. I want to actually explore that a little more because I run into the same thing. I started off with a, with a task <span style="color:red" data-ts="520.15" data-end_ts="520.44" title="520.15" id=c_"520.15">__scam__</span>, port <span style="color:red" data-ts="521.36" data-end_ts="521.52" title="521.36" id=c_"521.36">__of__</span> Studio as well. And also at the same time, I was really influenced by a lot of, a lot of stuff that was, oh, I would say it was like classic rock of one ilk or another, you know? Mm-hmm. <affirmative> <affirmative>. So it was, it was, recorded at the highest end of equipment. And, I mentioned this in an earlier podcast too. I feel like somehow I missed the memo that said tape ops style, like weird. Grungy sound was cool, <laugh>, I just felt like somehow that that ugly sound was my fault for doing something wrong, you know? Yeah. And so I spent so much time, looking for that, and it's only, it's only later, much later that I came to realize that some of that funky stuff, what's, what's actually there is the machines that have some soul, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Yes. Exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, and, you know, trying to find the soulfulness in some of this gear could be, I mean, I noticed one of the sound packs you have is Casio Veal one, which I actually did a bunch of recording of, and finding the soulfulness of it means rejecting like 90% of the sounds it actually makes Yeah. <laugh>. And then, you know, finding the 10% that actually really sound cool, and it's always like on the ragged edges, like the, an, you know, the flute played way too low. <span style="color:red" data-ts="613.35" data-end_ts="613.64" title="613.35" id=c_"613.35">__Yeah__</span>. Or the bass guitar played way too high. That was when things started getting interesting, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>It <span style="color:red" data-ts="619.48" data-end_ts="619.72" title="619.48" id=c_"619.48">__started__</span> falling apart, those sounds and <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Yeah. But it was weird. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Things happen. It, it took 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Me a long time to get to the point where I realized, wow, that kind of, you know, the fact that I worked that hard to find the right tone out of that machine meant that there was a soulfulness to it that didn't exist. When I would take the really great synth and play it into the really great recorder. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>I think part of that for me, was maybe submission <laugh>. Yeah. You know, trying to get things perfect and realizing it wasn't working out. So I'm just gonna sort of accept what I can do and stop worrying about getting things sounding perfect. And that kind of, I, you know, today, this day and age, like, it's very easy to get those clean recordings, and it's also very easy to get obsessive about it too. Yeah. And making everything perfect. And once I kind of let go of that, I found I was making music easier and embracing the kind of defects and the, you know, the, if somebody was talking in the background of a track I was recording, to me, that kind of became cool after a while. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>You always heard that on The Beatles, right there. It's in some of the old recordings, some kind of nonsense going on, and that, that made people listen and they'd say, what is he saying? Paul is dead? What's going on? <laugh>, you know, creates the mystique. Sounds like real people doing it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I, I hear you. And it's funny because, for me, the, in, in the early days of recording, my biggest influence was Steely Dan <laugh>. What a horrible influence to have. Right. <laugh>. I really wish it would've been like Iggy Pop or something, you know, <laugh> Yeah. Who, whose, whose goal was to do a whole bunch of stuff and do it quick and get it onto wax and get it out there instead, my influence was these people who were anal retentive to the hilt. Right. Yeah. And unfortunately, it seemed that that stuck in my head as, as somehow representing, being serious, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Yeah. I, I've always like appreciated, Neil Young, for instance, for, he's, his attitude is kind of, you know, get it while it's hot, you know, fresh, you know, and I've worked with friends before. One of my friends Dave, was really, you know, I'm getting deeper and deeper into computer recording, and he's getting into his, boss' b r eight digital <span style="color:red" data-ts="763.85" data-end_ts="764.2" title="763.85" id=c_"763.85">__eight__</span> track, and I'm like thinking, you know, this is like a toy almost you're using right. Yet he's pumping out recordings and they sound cool, you know, they've got this like dirtiness to 'em and they Right. He's really got the energy of his tracks going. And sometimes you lose that when you get too clinical and you really like, you know, you're, building things and you're trying to make everything sound just right and you start to lose that kind of passion you had that made you want to go record in the first place. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. So when you're, when you're kind of contemplating the idea of putting together a sample pack or something like that, what is it, how much do you pre-think it versus how much do you go with something that inspires you? So for example, like you've got one that's the, you call the Poly 800 Armageddon Pack mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Right? So that's obviously a Poly 800, and you're doing a bunch of manipulation on it. My question is, were you playing the Poly 800 and said, oh, I gotta do a pack? Or, or did you say, I want <span style="color:red" data-ts="827.8" data-end_ts="827.88" title="827.8" id=c_"827.8">__to__</span> do a pack and Poly eight hundred's, a lot of fun, you know, <laugh>. Yeah. Which way do you, which way do you kind of go with that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>That particular one? My buddy Mike Long, <span style="color:red" data-ts="837.52" data-end_ts="837.72" title="837.52" id=c_"837.52">__oh__</span>. The same guy that showed me how to <span style="color:red" data-ts="838.88" data-end_ts="839.16" title="838.88" id=c_"838.88">__planter__</span> Sandman got the Poly 800 off of Craigslist or something like that. And, he was just playing around with it and loved it, you know? And as we started listening to it more and more, we <span style="color:red" data-ts="852.4" data-end_ts="852.64" title="852.4" id=c_"852.4">__sort__</span> of got a kick out of the kind of like end of the world sound to it. Right. And this isn't 2012, you know, December 21st is coming up and like, you know, it's, it's ripe for the time and, you know, it, it had this like sci-fi eighties terminator sound to it that, you know, again, there's a nostalgia to that. You know, we grew up watching those movies, we just started making sounds that kind of embodied that feeling. <span style="color:red" data-ts="878.01" data-end_ts="878.36" title="878.01" id=c_"878.01">__Right__</span>. So I think the real thing that happens is it, it's born out of like, what do I want <laugh>? Sure. You know, I wanna have these like really cool like Terminator sounds, you know, for synthesizers to use, and I want to have like Nintendo sounds. That's the real thing, you know, my outlook, if I'm gonna build a big pack, I at least want to know that I'm gonna end up with something that I'm happy to use. So it's kind of like I'm building myself the thing, and then if other people want it, that's great. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's interesting because when I look at like, your stuff, it looks like a very personal collection. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> that is sort of being shown to me. It's, it's sort of like, oh, I was just at a store with my son and it was one of these stores that sells, like, magic the gathering cards and stuff like that. Right. And you talk to people and they would kind of like open up their little wallet and show you their special collection of stuff that represents their favorite thing mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Right. I look at your list of things and I feel that sense, that sense of it being a very personal collection and sort of a thing that is kind of your stuff that you're also letting other people take a look at. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Yeah, definitely. It's, you know, I'm not gonna really get to, I, I just wouldn't have the patience to start building something that I'm not personally interested in. Right. You know, then it becomes work if becomes a job. And, I think like, kind of one thing I'm always trying to do is put some heart and soul into it and put something, you know, that extra sprinkle of love that makes the, mashed potatoes that grandma makes so delicious <laugh> in there, you know, I'm looking for that. So yeah, I think that's very true. It's really, it's just like if it catches my ear kind of thing that I'm interested in it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Now, you said that you started off and kind of came through, the system as a rock musician and you kind of swung over to electronic musician as a, as a result of liking to do sound design. Yeah. What would you say is the kind of music you're doing now? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Well, right now I'm still, I think, rooted in like the rock and roll songwriter kind of thing. I have lyrics in most of my songs. I'm singing their verses in choruses. I'm always into like, the catchy fun song. You know, that's just something I've always enjoyed. Sure. That's what really gets me, I think, is the song. The song is number one. A lot of times the sounds inspire me to create the songs, but the song is really key. So right now I think I'm making like a, it's, it's kind of rockish, it's kind of, electronic elements are in there, some of the big heavier beats. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1049.84" data-end_ts="1050.12" title="1049.84" id=c_"1049.84">__Even__</span> production techniques, maybe like side chain compression or something that's really common in electronic music. Right. But it's, it's kind of like, a spattering of the things I'm into. There's video game sounds, there's guitar, there's, you know, samples from, video games and movies and stuff like that. I have a hard time describing it to be honest with you, but it's, I think it's like kind of important for me to say, like, it's very song centric though. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I think that's interesting because, a lot of the people doing electronic based music, and particularly a lot of people using Ableton, avoid song <span style="color:red" data-ts="1093.39" data-end_ts="1093.88" title="1093.39" id=c_"1093.39">__formats__</span>, particularly avoid lyrics as if they were radioactive <laugh>. There's, and I think some of it comes from the bedroom producer thing, which, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1103.62" data-end_ts="1103.84" title="1103.62" id=c_"1103.62">__is__</span> people saying, eh, I'm not actually even comfortable talking to people, let alone singing them a song, so I'm just gonna stick with the instrumental. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Yeah. I, I do see that a lot. A lot of the music that I come across is instrumental and it's gotten me more into instrumental music, actually, as a result. But, yeah, for me it's always the song, you know, that's what catches me. That's what gets me excited, you know, singing along to <span style="color:red" data-ts="1130.92" data-end_ts="1131.04" title="1130.92" id=c_"1130.92">__a__</span>, like a song I love or, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and don't you think that having lyrics actually can make a song a lot more memorable? I mean, I have to admit that, that even though I had some, and even going back to my rock and roll days, you know, I loved, Edgar Winter's Frankenstein, and I could sing it. I just didn't walk around singing it, you know, it versus singing, you know, Mustang Sally. Right. <laugh>. Yeah. It's, there's something about lyrics that make a song somehow stick in our brains better. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Yeah. Well, you get that whole idea behind it, you know, the whole theme that goes on, the message. It's, you know, in <span style="color:red" data-ts="1176.08" data-end_ts="1176.2" title="1176.08" id=c_"1176.08">__a__</span>, in an instrumental track, it, it's more I think about the vibe and the feeling. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>But, I, I guess one of the last bands I was in, it's kind of a revelation we had, was like, we're gonna be playing in bars all the time, you know, we're gonna be playing for people that are out trying to have fun, so why are we going to give them material that is like, you know, deep and arty and, you know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Why, why be so serious? Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Right. So we just had fun with it. We were like a surf rock band, kind of like the Ramones and the Beach Boys Meet Nirvana or something like that. And all us songs were two and a half minutes long, but they all had catchy choruses, and they were all like, sang something like enjoyable and like kind of in the mood for what you were doing if you were out at a bar on a Friday night. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>And that that just like, you know, stirs up an energy, I just don't think you get, but if you can sing along with something and there's some kind of like idea that you're promoting, you know, whatever it might be. We had a song called me and the guys, it was just about going out and hanging out with the guys, but it was fun. It was, and that was the whole point of it was to be fun first. And I think the lyrics really help you drive some of those, ideas home, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Drive them home. Right. Yeah. It seems like it's hard to do instrumental music that's kind of simple. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> that by the nature of the focus that you give the instrumentation and instrumental music, all of a sudden it's like, well, I have to layer this 17 times <laugh> and, and all this stuff where, if you're doing vocals, you can have a VL one doing a counter melody, and everyone's like, well, that was quirky and cool. Right, right. You know, especially if the, if the lyrics kind of back up that, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1285.19" data-end_ts="1285.48" title="1285.19" id=c_"1285.19">__back__</span> up that conceptually 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Yeah. And you can look at like just, some of the, you know, chord progressions. You're never gonna hear an electronic instrumental, you know, intelligent dance music track that's doing like the 1 4, 5 progression <laugh>, you know? Right. But you can hear millions of great rock songs that, you know, rely on it. Right. And it's just, whatever it is, there's a magic to that progression. But, it, you don't hear that. And often, like, you don't even hear core progressions in a lot of, instrumental music. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Because a lot of instrumental music is so focused on the sound. I mean, I have to admit that when, when techno music came along, I was really excited by a music that was, was willing to say, we're going to move sound design front and center. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, I was really excited by that. Right. But, and boy, this is gonna show, you know, show me as the whole, you know, kids get off my lawn, kind of a guy <laugh>. But, we've 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>All got that in us, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I guess we do <laugh>, but sort of the, I I teach at, at a local university, and, I just got done teaching a sound arts class, and what I noticed was that every, all the kids wanted to use these dubstep tracks and dubs tracks is really the, the victory of sound design over any subtlety whatsoever. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And I was, I actually found myself sort of like, oh man, someone would just give me like four bars of a string section. Right. <laugh> Yeah. Or something that didn't have a big base drop as the important, as the comma in the middle of the sentence. Right, right. I, I started really craving more traditional song form and more traditional instrumentation simply because I felt like I was getting pummeled with these sounds. Now again, yeah. You know, you, you can just visualize me shaking my tiny fist at, at the world and saying, you have forgotten me. Right. But, there is, I, I had always thought that the thing I longed for was more sound design, and then when I get completely surrounded by it, it's sort of like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1430.26" data-end_ts="1430.48" title="1430.26" id=c_"1430.26">__Hey__</span>, I kind of missed that song form stuff as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>There are certainly trends in music that are always gonna kind of turn you off, you know? Yeah. I, I don't necessarily see it as a, one or the other kind of thing. You know, I'm, I don't listen to Dove <span style="color:red" data-ts="1448.8" data-end_ts="1448.96" title="1448.8" id=c_"1448.8">__step__</span>. It's not for me really. But I do appreciate a lot of the techniques that are used. I've learned a lot from it. I've learned a lot about the way they chop things up and just some of the constantly changing like big synth parts, and how to make your, you know, base drop really heavy mm-hmm. <affirmative> and have an impact. That's, that's a dynamics thing in there, which I think is kind of cool. So I, I've look at a lot of that stuff as something to learn from, you know, I'm not gonna necessarily put it on and like, you know, sound like I've got like a, a circular sore running in my background. You're 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Not gonna, you're not gonna like wash dishes and fold clothes to that. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Yeah. And I guess probably most of those people aren't either. They're probably, that's music <span style="color:red" data-ts="1496.58" data-end_ts="1496.8" title="1496.58" id=c_"1496.58">__for__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1496.8" data-end_ts="1496.92" title="1496.8" id=c_"1496.8">__a__</span> certain environment, you know? Yeah. And where they listen, it's very effective there. But as far as, you know, me, like you said, if I'm gonna put on my headphones and just, kind of take a walk or something <laugh> with my dog, I'm not gonna want that going on. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1515.04" data-end_ts="1515.16" title="1515.04" id=c_"1515.04">__I__</span> don't, I don't get many people that, I haven't interviewed many people that have kind of this lyrics part <span style="color:red" data-ts="1521.92" data-end_ts="1522.16" title="1521.92" id=c_"1521.92">__their__</span> thing. So I wanna dive into this a little more and pick your brain about the process you go through to do that. Sure. What is it, first of all, what, what is it that makes you that comfortable with words? I mean, if I had to start, it doesn't help that I, I have a tremendous self-consciousness about my voice. Right. I come from northern Wisconsin. I feel like I just fell off the turnip truck <laugh>, you know? So I, I have self-conscious about my voice, which means that I tend to be really self-conscious about the words I use, and all of a sudden the whole concept of making lyrics is this black hole of self-reflection and depression that drives me nuts. How do you avoid all that stuff? Or don't you? I don't know. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>I'm curious. Well, Darwin to tell you, first off, I think you've got a great voice for the show. Well, thanks. You know, don't, I wasn't 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Actually fishing for a compliment, but I'll take it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>No, but it's true. You know, even when we started this conversation, it, it has a weight to it, which is really nice. But I, I understand that completely. I'm from New York, you know, and sometimes you still to sound, you know, long Island guy here, <laugh>. Sometimes I hear myself and I notice that a lot. Right. I think for me, probably I was just too young and naive when I started <laugh>. Oh, sure. Okay. You know, I didn't even know I was singing bad until like, I started to, <laugh> really listen back. But as it, I think, a lot of it is done at home in the, in the bedroom, in the basement studio, you know, so there's no one there listening. There's no one there critiquing you, so you have your chance to work on it. And, you know, every once in a while you get something you like and that's what you put out. So there's a filtering process going on. Well, but hold 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>On a second. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1641.04" data-end_ts="1641.16" title="1641.04" id=c_"1641.04">__It__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1641.16" data-end_ts="1641.2" title="1641.16" id=c_"1641.16">__is__</span> something 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>I've had 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>To work on before, before you go farther with that, I want to hear more about that because the only person who I've ever heard about talk about that editing process, was Brian Eno, who talks about, making massive amounts of work for the little amount that he releases. Right? Yeah. Tell me, I mean, since you opened the door, tell me what is, what, what that editing process looks like. Do you record it and just say, oh, hey, that recording and put it away and never look at it again? Do you like delete the recording? Do you stash it somewhere and come back later and say, that was brilliant, and that's how you decide? What is, what is the mechanism that you go through in, in determining when you've got a keeper? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Well, every once in a while you have that magic day where you just find it and you nail, you found it and it just unfolds before you. But that is like, you know, one in a million <laugh>. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, unfortunately, there's a lot of working at it. I, I'm always experimenting just with making things up. Even if, you know, if I'm learning, if I'm trying to, come up with new techniques or if I'm building say, a sound pack, I try to make something with it. And every once in a while you get something you like. That's really nice. It, it, it depends a lot about, like, if I'm in the mood for it, I think, but I don't, I really don't try, I try not to delete anything. I try to just keep stuff which, you know, is a problem in of itself <span style="color:red" data-ts="1734.4" data-end_ts="1734.84" title="1734.4" id=c_"1734.4">__because__</span> you get, you know, what do you sift through once you have all that, those gigs of information and all, there's a lot of the kind of coming back to it and being like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1746.16" data-end_ts="1746.32" title="1746.16" id=c_"1746.16">__oh__</span>, you know, that was pretty good. 'cause sometimes when you're in the heat of the moment you think you, you think something completely sucks because like, you don't like the way your vocal is eqd mm-hmm. <affirmative>, you know? Right. Or, or, you feel like, or just 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The headphone feedback or whatever. It didn't 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Work. Yeah. Something like, there's so many things that can kill your motivation and inspiration in a flash. And, I think looking back after some time passes, you sometimes do get surprised and say, that's actually pretty good. I might work with that. Or, or that that's perfect the way it is. I don't know what my problem was <laugh>. Right. But it's, it's sometimes that stuff doesn't strike me until later on, a little while later. And sometimes, you know, right away and you're just feeling it and you're in the mood for it, and it just happens. But that is really probably, very, you know, few and far between. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1800.81" data-end_ts="1801.16" title="1800.81" id=c_"1800.81">__Right__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. So I'm sorry for hijacking the conversation. No, no. You brought it up and I've been dying to find someone who I could make talk about that process <laugh>, so thanks. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Oh, you're welcome. But anyway, it's, there's no magic formula though. For me it's just keep working, keep going. One of, my favorite books I've read is, the War of Art by Stephen Pressfield. Which is just so great for, getting you motivated. And he talks about being a pro, and the pro doesn't wait around for the inspiration or the mood is right. The pro just gets to work every single day and then looks at it later. The, the point of the job is not to make something amazing, it's just to make something. And in that process, something amazing will hopefully come out. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now what, for you, when you're, when you're developing new material, what, how do you get the, how do you germinate the seeds of ideas? So for example, one of the tricks that I found really works for me is to say, well, I'm gonna make my version, I'm gonna make basically a cover version of some track, right? Yeah. And then, I'll be like an hour into it and I'll be like, well, that baseline was wrong, but <span style="color:red" data-ts="1891.22" data-end_ts="1891.44" title="1891.22" id=c_"1891.22">__ooh__</span>, I really like that baseline. I don't need to do that track anymore. I'm just gonna do my own thing based off of this thing I stumbled on. There was something about, you know, limiting myself to saying, I'm gonna do a cover of this simple thing. That gave me the, almost like a sense of relief that I could just get started. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>I like that process a lot, actually. I grew up, you know, thinking like, there's, you're ripping that off, you're copying this. Right, right. And my first band was very big into early Weezer that was, very defining material for us. Okay. And, we sounded like it a bit, but we didn't sound exactly like them. And looking back, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1935.28" data-end_ts="1935.56" title="1935.28" id=c_"1935.28">__this__</span>, I don't even know how many people would draw that connection anymore. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>But I think having like, something you're kind of aiming at whether or not you hit the target, and sometimes it's better to not hit the target. Yeah. It, it does like, focus your, efforts. Because I mean, if you think about it, when you, when you go to sit down and make music, you have the world at your fingertips nowadays, you've got pretty much access to every sound ever. You know, sample packs get you any synth you could ever want to use. If you play some instruments, you've got that. There's so much to choose from. And that in itself is overwhelming sometimes. Back in the day of the four track recorder, I had a guitar, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b><laugh>, that was it, it was gonna happen on guitar. And that eliminated that, decision to like, what am I gonna make this track sound like? And you just went for it from there. And I think I got a lot more done with that. So I like that idea of like, kind of, I'll hear a song, oh, I like what they're doing there, I'm gonna try something like that. And, you know, I, back in the old days, I might've thought that was copying, but now I realize it's just kind of being inspired. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, there's, there's a filtering thing that happens there too. I mean, most of us have neither the chops nor the memory to be able to say, everything I heard today is still in the hopper, and I'm gonna regurgitate that. Yeah. Just the process of it going into your head, your preference machine, keeping some things and throwing away other things makes it so that it's gonna be impossible for you to actually be stealing anyway. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Yeah. It's kind of true. And it's a funny thing when I realized it, I was, I felt very relieved. Yeah. It's like, you know, like, oh, great. Like, now I can kind of learn from anything. I can steal even a cord progression if I wanted to. Right. I think I read Kurt Cobain saying he used to rewrite Beatles songs until they were his own songs changing this, changing that. Oh, that's great. It was a technique he used. Sure. I don't <span style="color:red" data-ts="2064.2" data-end_ts="2064.28" title="2064.2" id=c_"2064.2">__know__</span> if that's hearsay, so I don't wanna, you know, go on air putting words in someone's mouth, but, but 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Whether it's true or not, it's a great concept. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Yeah. The concept I thought was kind of cool, and it sort of freed me from things like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2075.88" data-end_ts="2076" title="2075.88" id=c_"2075.88">__oh__</span>, that's a cool drumbeat, you know, let's use that and let's build from there. So I like that process a lot. I, I'm a big believer in like, creating limitations Asian personally, especially nowadays. Where, like I said, there's just too many options. I can, you know, you could spend all day going through your 9,000 kick drum samples <span style="color:red" data-ts="2100.79" data-end_ts="2101.08" title="2100.79" id=c_"2100.79">__till__</span> you find the perfect one <laugh>. Right. And then you have no music to show for <span style="color:red" data-ts="2104.44" data-end_ts="2104.56" title="2104.44" id=c_"2104.44">__it__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So what are, what are some things that you do to limit, limit your palate or limit put limits on yourself? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Well, like part of my creating my own sounds is I decide to use them and now I'm kind of limited. You know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2120.76" data-end_ts="2121" title="2120.76" id=c_"2120.76">__they're__</span>, they're getting kinda large now, but, <laugh>, you know, there's, there's a limitation there. I might decide today I wanna play my guitar, you know, today I'm gonna sit down at the drums, maybe, or, or sometimes it's just a theme that pops in your head, like something somebody will say and you're like, Ooh, I like that. I'm gonna see if I can't make a song out of that. But I try to pick something to start with. I, I love like, you know, going down and just seeing where the vibe takes me, you know, and that kind of freeform, like, Hey man, let's just see what happens. You know? Right. Put on <span style="color:red" data-ts="2156.92" data-end_ts="2157.04" title="2156.92" id=c_"2156.92">__our__</span> instruments. That's a lot of fun. And sometimes you do get great stuff from that. And I think it's a good kind of release too, to go through once in a while. But I find I get more done when I focus myself. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> and limit myself. Especially. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, you talked before about doing some things with Mike Longo, who was, who apparently has been a influential collaborator for quite some time. Do you still do work with him and do you do other collaborative work? Or do you mostly focus on solo work? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Yeah. Well, you know, Mike and I've been best friends since we were in fourth grade. So it's, you know, as soon as we get together, we're already kinda laughing 'cause we <span style="color:red" data-ts="2200.52" data-end_ts="2200.56" title="2200.52" id=c_"2200.52">__know__</span> we're gonna have <span style="color:red" data-ts="2201" data-end_ts="2201.04" title="2201" id=c_"2201">__a__</span> good time. It's just one of those friendships, that I think you can only really have with a lifelong thing. Right. So, there's always something cool that comes out of it. And I think we both have a high level of respect for each other as far as musicians go. I love collaborating with people though. I, I think it's so refreshing to like, see what other people are thinking, what they're doing, where they're coming from. And it, it goes, I think we were talking about this earlier, maybe this was before the interview. We were talking about, students and learning from them and how, you know, sometimes if you have no experience, that's a, a benefit. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Right. 'cause you're, you know, we're kind of colored by our experiences and it influences what we choose to do. When I was first learning to play guitar, I was taking lessons, learning theory, and I was showing my friend Thomas down the street how to play guitar so I could play with him. Right. And, he didn't, he wasn't learning the theory. He wasn't learning like the major scales and stuff. He was, I've shown him power chords, put your hand on this fret, then go to this fret <laugh> and I'm gonna play a solo over it. <laugh>. Right, right. And then he'd go home and then he'd come back the next day. He was like, Hey Brian, I made up something kind of cool and he'd play something. And I'd be like, you're not supposed to do that <laugh>. That's against everything I just learned. Right. It sounds cool. Right. So I, I think there's like something to be said for that. Like, you can learn from anybody. There's someone, there's something to learn. And I mean, even if it's what not to do, there's something to learn there. But I think fresh perspectives are just, you know, priceless. 'cause we're in our heads all day long, and to get some interaction with somebody else can really just like, open up a whole new world. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Do you ever, do you ever do just kind of blind collaborations? Like, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2313.74" data-end_ts="2313.96" title="2313.74" id=c_"2313.74">__oh__</span>, I, I was talking to this guy on a mail list and all of a sudden he just showed up and we did a track. Do you ever do that kind of thing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>I don't know about that blind. I've done it with sound packs though. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> where people will send me some samples. You know, every once in a while somebody's like, Hey man, check this out. And I'm, I'll love the samples <span style="color:red" data-ts="2336.86" data-end_ts="2337.08" title="2336.86" id=c_"2336.86">__of__</span>, Hey, can I do something with it? Or they'll build <span style="color:red" data-ts="2338.76" data-end_ts="2338.88" title="2338.76" id=c_"2338.76">__a__</span> instrument. It was actually the last one I did, a man named Corey Morgan, who I, I don't know at all, aside from emails and stuff, sent me some flute samples and we made a cool little, instrument pack out of it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, that's cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>In a lot of ways, that's how I got involved with Mark Moser too. You know, we'd been kind of following each other's work mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And then we just decided to work together and he sent me some crazy wave table samples. <laugh>, you know, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2367.8" data-end_ts="2368.08" title="2367.8" id=c_"2367.8">__know__</span> you're familiar with his work. He, he can create some far out sounds. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Indeed. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>And, at first I'm like, I don't know what to do with this. But, you know, it challenged me and it made me look, look at it a little bit differently and came out with something kind of cool. I think that's stuff is cool to do because you can kind of do anything with a sound. But yeah, I love to jam with people too. I mean, that's really the, I think one of the ultimate musical experiences is just playing with someone else in a live situation. And that's the way it has been, I guess, throughout human existence, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2410.05" data-end_ts="2410.4" title="2410.05" id=c_"2410.05">__where__</span> there was no like sending files over email, but that's like, you just get that kind of like, yeah. It's just a communication that, is beyond words and ideas. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Do you ever perform live? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Yeah. Yeah. Quite often. I've, I'm playing tomorrow night in my hometown, which will be a lot of fun since people are home from college. And, . 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Your hometown is where? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Babylon, New York. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Long Island Uhhuh. So a lot of people are home for the holidays from wherever they might be. So a bunch of friends are playing some music. It's gonna be a lot of fun. I love playing live. Like, like I said, that's, that's really, the ultimate thrill Sure. To, to be in front of people and have that energy exchange. It becomes like a feedback loop where, you know, they're feeling what you're doing, then you're feeling what they're doing and it makes you more into it and they get more into it. That to me is just, that's untouchable. That's, I don't know. I guess that's like climbing to the top of the mountain or something. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So now, you have DJ prominent in your, sort of like public name. How much is your life performance dj, like, and how much of it is musician? Performer, like <laugh>? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>I have, I spend a lot of time telling people I'm not a DJ <laugh>, you know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2501.54" data-end_ts="2501.76" title="2501.54" id=c_"2501.54">__And__</span>, you know, then you might know <laugh> what I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Have. I know. You know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2506.56" data-end_ts="2506.68" title="2506.56" id=c_"2506.56">__a__</span> a lot of the alias thing kind of started, you know, I'm a high school teacher and I wanted to just sort of not use my real name. Right. And, kind of keep that separate. I mean, you know, your students will find you anyway. They're more savvy on the internet than we are <laugh>. But, so that name was just sort of a, you know, just a silly name that I just used. And the stuff I started doing started catching on a little bit. Then I felt bad about changing, and I just, whatever. I just don't even think about it too hard anymore. But I'm, I guess there are DJ elements to what I do. I mean, I'm playing all original music mm-hmm. <affirmative>. But, you know, as far as like kind of mixing between tracks and putting the effects on, there's a lot of DJ techniques going on there, but I, I think of it more as like live musician. It's very heavy on the vocals. I do some synth playing live. I don't actually do any guitar playing right now. Just not sure that that, is worth it. I was listening to an interview, I think the last interview you had on the podcast, and you guys were talking about, you know, what's worth doing live and what starts taking away from it. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And, if you're spending your whole time looking at your pedal board, did you somehow mess things up? Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Right. And I just don't know that like, you know, strumming the guitar and playing some chords or solos is really adding as much as it would to not do that <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I also wonder too, I mean, I'm a guitar, my first instrument was guitar as well. Hmm. And I wonder to what extent playing it, it would almost be that playing a guitar as a distraction from putting together a good performance because, and I know there are people that are gonna hate me for saying such a thing, but if what you're doing, so I assume you use Ableton liven performance, right? Yeah. Yeah. So if you're going to be selecting clips, mixing and matching clips, doing cross fades and stuff like that, it's really hard to do with the guitar strapped across your neck. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Yeah. And, I, I'm singing a lot too, and a, and a lot of it, you know, I had <span style="color:red" data-ts="2652.76" data-end_ts="2652.88" title="2652.76" id=c_"2652.76">__a__</span>, there was a point where I had to decide if I wanted like the headset or the microphone <laugh>. Right, right. And I like the physical grabbing of the microphone, you know, it's part of it. It's like I picture like, like Henry Rollins or someone like that. Oh yeah. You know, this great frontman that just like Steven Tyler, you know, Steven Tyler can't have a headset, headset, you know? No, you're right. You're <span style="color:red" data-ts="2672.44" data-end_ts="2672.48" title="2672.44" id=c_"2672.44">__right__</span>. He's dancing with his mic stand half the show. Yeah. And I really liked that kind of like, physicality. And plus I can kind of sneak out from behind the table every once in a while and kind of interact with the crowd more. A guitar sort of pins you down a little bit and I was, I'm always afraid, and this is like something I always deal with when I'm playing live. It's like, I don't wanna look like I'm doing karaoke. I don't wanna look like I'm playing guitar to like, you know, a keyboard track, <laugh> backing track. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>It's a hard thing for me to kind of, and I, I know it's a lot of, it's in my head, but it's a hard thing to kind of find the balance For sure. That makes sense. And I just worry that like it's doesn't add as much as, I would like it to. But playing a band, playing guitar <span style="color:red" data-ts="2724.44" data-end_ts="2724.64" title="2724.44" id=c_"2724.44">__is__</span> like totally different story. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. But, but doing 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's doing solo, it'd be pretty rough. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Yeah. It's like, I kind of feel like if I was gonna like do a guitar lead over a track, it's just me kind of saying, Hey, look at how good I'm in <span style="color:red" data-ts="2737.54" data-end_ts="2737.76" title="2737.54" id=c_"2737.54">__at__</span> guitar. You know, check it out everybody. Right. And like, I mean, that might be cool like once in the show, but like every track like, all right, here I go again. Right. Well, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2747.63" data-end_ts="2747.92" title="2747.63" id=c_"2747.63">__it's__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2747.92" data-end_ts="2748.04" title="2747.92" id=c_"2747.92">__let__</span> my computer hold down the beat and, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And, and I'm gonna soar 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>When it's just me with a guitar. Yeah. With the machines <laugh>. Yeah. I don't know. Like, I've seen a lot of people do it. There are some people that are pretty cool with it. D v s mold over, they do some cool stuff like that. I just didn't see it like happening for me as much. Yeah. You know? Yeah. It's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting you mentioned mold Over I, that's the first person I think of as doing it. And, and he pulls it off. But to me just barely. And I, and I think it's not because of any issue for him, I think it's just a hard thing to do. 'cause you're right. If you're standing there on stage and all of a sudden I'm like, okay, here comes the guitar solo. It's really hard not to look like a prick. You know, <laugh> hate to say 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>I know what you mean. That's, that's what I fear, I guess. Yeah. You know, it's, it's cool when you got like, you can go up to the bass player and interact with <span style="color:red" data-ts="2807.4" data-end_ts="2807.56" title="2807.4" id=c_"2807.4">__them__</span>. . You know, all that stuff is, I mean, obviously that's a tried and true formula. Indeed. But the like, kind of solo guy up there, just like playing a lead. I don't know. I, I've never been a guitar player that was really into like, technicality. Like, I think a Jimi Hendrix more of a songwriter than a guitar player <span style="color:red" data-ts="2831.22" data-end_ts="2831.44" title="2831.22" id=c_"2831.22">__and__</span> a sound design, like a tone wizard on the guitar. Obviously he's an amazing guitar player. But, like for instance, like someone like Stevie Ray Vaughn mm-hmm. <affirmative>, I, I never really got into mm-hmm. <affirmative>. 'cause it was about how good Stevie Ray Vaughn is on his guitar to me. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="2849.64" data-end_ts="2849.76" title="2849.64" id=c_"2849.64">__I__</span>, right. To me, I don't know. It just, and there are people that like, eat that up. I just never was that way. Right. So. Well 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's interesting. That's, that's cool. So before we're all, I can't believe that the time is burning through so fast already. I say that at at every podcast <span style="color:red" data-ts="2870.39" data-end_ts="2870.88" title="2870.39" id=c_"2870.39">__because__</span> I know it's one of those 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Things. I'm glad I was hoping you'd say that for me. <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2874.69" data-end_ts="2875.04" title="2874.69" id=c_"2874.69">__Right__</span>. Well, now I have to say it for all the kids, but <laugh>. But, what's, I want to get into something, here that's, specific to you, but I think is gonna be interesting to a lot of people. You are a certified Ableton trainer, right? Yeah. What situations do you find yourself in? Because when I, when I look at kind of the list of people who are doing it, you have some like Laura or Chase Dobson or some of these other people that are really focusing on working with people on putting together tour systems and doing that kind of thing. And then there are other people that are into doing workshops and teaching. What do you find yourself drawn into? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Teaching's definitely big for me. I started teaching, for Berkeley Music online. Okay. With their advanced production, with Ableton live course. Private lessons and the occasional workshop. Maybe I'll go into the city to do something, or that's about that really. And I think it also opened a lot of doors for, collaborating with different people, different companies. A lot of that kind of stuff for me. I, I'm not looking to get on like a big tour or anything, as amazing as that work is. You know, I, I can't really do that anyway. I would have to leave my job. Right. But, that's kind of not where it is for me as far as the interests. I do really like interacting with people and, and showing them the things and learning from them. My Berkeley class, for instance, we do an hour chat every week and it, it always goes over. It's just exciting <laugh> and it's, so, it's cool to like, just talk to people that are really excited about it. As to compare it to like teaching high school English, you need to take my class to graduate in high school, <laugh>. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>And you are, you know, you have to be there and you have to do the work. And I, I spend a lot of time, you know, making people do things they don't wanna do <laugh>, which can be a little depressing sometimes when you think about it. But when I teach music production, like everyone's like, you know, really excited. They're like asking questions. They're trying to get a better view. They're trying to get to the front. In high school, a lot of people are drooling on themselves at seven in the morning. <laugh>. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, but do you, do you find yourself having to, even with teaching able <span style="color:red" data-ts="3027" data-end_ts="3027.2" title="3027" id=c_"3027">__in__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3027.2" data-end_ts="3027.44" title="3027.2" id=c_"3027.2">__life__</span>, having to compel people to do things they don't want to do, for example, I know you want to do drum tracks, but we're going to work on learning compression or any of that kinda stuff. Is that, do you end up having to pull that kind of stuff anyway? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>It does, it does happen occasionally. But at the same time, I do try to like give my students what they're looking for. Mm-hmm. Because, you know, the program's so deep music production is so deep. Right. I, I'd rather get them, excited about doing stuff and then we can get into the finer details of compressing a track or, you know, if, if them making a drumbeat is gonna get them pumped up and give them enough motivation to keep going, that's great. But a drumbeat, if me teaching them, yeah. If me teaching them compression is gonna turn them off to the process and make them think it's too much, then I'd, I'd rather not do that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Finally, since you do, since you do do music and stuff, where can people go to hear your work? Where can they go to hear some of your, your music, maybe buy some of your music or, and where can they go to see you perform in general? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Well, the music right now is on SoundCloud, soundcloud.com/afro djm. I don't have a proper recording out yet. I've kind of done things backwards. I think I've set up all my songs for live Performance first, and I think a lot of people write their songs and record them, then build the live performance set around it. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. But, my approach has been sort of to like, kind of jam on ideas until I start getting structure I like. That was always a, a little issue for me, in writing music is that I've come up with a lot of parts and not sure how to put it all together, but using live, I'm able to come up with those parts and then jam on the arrangement. So my next real big project is to get those live tracks into like a recorded format, which I am, you know, been saying this for a long time. But that's, that's one of the next moves for me. But right now most of the other stuff, most of the music is on SoundCloud. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Well cool. I think everyone needs to go and take a listen. It's, there's some fun stuff there. Brian, thank you so much. Again, Afro dj, afro dj mack.com is where people can go for kind of a launching point. And, thank you so much for your time, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Darwin thank you so much for having me. You're doing great work on this podcast and <span style="color:red" data-ts="3187.2" data-end_ts="3187.4" title="3187.2" id=c_"3187.2">__ah__</span>, thanks a lot and Thanksgiving. I'm very thankful for this <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, thank you. Alright. Have a great day man. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>You too. Take care. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nobody: </b><i>Okay. </i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Just a quick note from the road. I'm still driving around the United States here, trying to get back home, but, I just wanna thank again after DJ Mack. I want <span style="color:red" data-ts="3217.08" data-end_ts="3217.16" title="3217.08" id=c_"3217.08">__to__</span> thank him for the great chat. I want to thank you, the listeners. I hope that you had a good holiday if you celebrated. If you didn't, well, we'll, hope that you enjoy the next holiday that comes up. Otherwise, thanks a lot for listening and I'll catch you next week.
