      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Okay today, I get a chance to talk to, someone who's becoming an old friend of mine. We've had a chance to talk over the years in a lot of different situations. We used to be ma'am buddies, we'd see each other at Nam shows and, and, music and mess up. But a couple of years ago, we talked to him about sort of his work in, in, his background. This time around, we're going to be talking more about both the development of an album and insert it. Now, if you haven't already read the title of the podcast, I will tell you, we are speaking with Allesandro Cortini and, he has an album that will have just been released when you hear this. It'll have been just released, it's called a Scuro Chiaro, and, it is a gorgeous album. It, it, it combines sort of the sound design and structural elements that I think we, we are all familiar with from his work with some really interesting sequencing op options and sequencing techniques that we're going to dig into a little bit more. So, with no more ado, let's say hello to Alisandra He-Man how are You?</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Thanks a lot for having this chat. I really appreciate it. And congratulations on your new Album.</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Allesandro: </b>
      Thank you so much. It's a, it's, it's very rewarding to finally have it out. Yeah.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Can you talk a little bit about what led you to create this particular work?</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Allesandro: </b>
       You know, for a lot of my releases, a lot of them were centered on one instrument for a long time where, you know, I sort of, my creativity was parked by the, by the limitations of the instrument and that worked very well for a long time. And then I'd say that sort of kept me not kept me, but I never really approached the studio as an ensemble of instruments, because I was always very anxious of sort of like having to expand. And so that process was a very get your feet wet sort of process. And it took a while. Those, the first record where I sort of started doing that where maybe an idea was born on one instrument, and then there were other instruments that were sort of like complimenting it, was Voluma Massimo, which came out two years ago. Scuro Chiaro is a continuation of U-Mass and windows sense that, Voluma Massimo was born from an array of compositions that I had, collected over.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Allesandro: </b>
      I don't even know how many years in the sense that I don't, I don't keep track of when things get done. I just do music every day. I record every day for myself. And then I go back and fish and these things tend to like cells. They tend to ideas, tend to gravitate towards each other, and then they would end up being what you call an album, you know, like they make sense together, you know, like, like a dish, like a recipe, like a good recipe, you know, like Voluma Massman was that way. It felt like I had a good, you know, good vintage wine and a good organic steak if you eat meat, but you know what I mean? Like, and then something else from another area of the world, but it doesn't matter when they were made or where they're from together, they make sense as a great meal.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Allesandro: </b>
      So that's how I sort of approached. I've been approaching records recently, basically Scuro Chiaro is born from two tracks that were part of the lineup, let's say Voluma, Massimo, but it just didn't fit. And, you know, I made this example before because of the food, but it's like, you know, you have a nice steak meal and then you have whipped cream put on. You're not going to put fucking whipped cream on top of it. Cause it just doesn't work. But that doesn't cut anything from, with cream and a sense that it's, you know, it has its perks. So the idea was I'd have to create another recipe for those ingredients. And so, those tracks were, you know, Lo Specchio basically two tracks that were released first. So it was Specchio chiaroscuro. And they were the starting point for the new album. Then basically what happens is that I just collect, you know, ideas from my archives that fit that mood.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Allesandro: </b>
      And it's basically just a discovery as I go, I don't know, what's going to end up in it. And it's not a desperate search for things in the sense that, you know, oh, I've got to find something to fix. No, it's a very fun and I really enjoy it because I have to admit that a lot of the things that I listen to that I haven't, you know, that I've never listened to that I've made years ago. I don't even remember making, because I made them to entertain myself and feel better. I didn't make them with the thought of them becoming a record or so in a way they're similar to like raw material, you know, that you don't, you might mind, for other reasons, you're not thinking about what it will become because you don't know what will become, you know what I mean? And it doesn't matter because you're, you're, you're truly, you know, extracting joy from just mining it. You know what I mean? That's how the records were born. The last two records.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>That makes a lot of sense. One question though, when you see that, you know, this is part of a daily recording practice that you do you're for yourself, you know, you also mentioned that this is part of like taking the studio experience, you work on an instrument and it kind of expand it with other instruments. Is that something you did after you chose it to go on? Or is this something that as part of that daily work, you bring all different parts of the studio and you do these fleshed out tracks and the creation of the album. Oh, okay. Really </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Allesandro: </b>
      Like, for example, there are certain times that one is, I mean, just like in the new, on the new record, on Scuro Chiaro, there are pieces that are one instrument, like, you know, Cory and Fiamma are CMT tracks, just straight, you know, played live one, take it's one take there's nothing added. I just, all I did, I recorded them. Both of them actually, Cory was recorded with, you know, a zoom. So two tracks were actually direct in, so the left and right, the Synthi and two tracks were done with the built-in microphone of the zoom. So I could mix imbalanced the live quote-unquote sound to the direct, more fuller sound. And then it was just a matter of making it sound as good as possible, but it's a live tape. That's a live recording and the same for Fiamma. And then there are things that are a little bit more they're alive, but they have certain nuances or attachments or add ons.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Allesandro: </b>
      Like for example, the track chiaroscuro chiaroscuro is recorded on an old booklet, or they used to call one 51, which actually comes from the San Francisco conservatory. And it's a three rack sort of thing in an old wooden case. It's like an early seventies with a keyboard when it's five step sequencer. And basically there's a five-step sequence that plays the main melody and the baseline. And then the keyboard, I just change the route basically. So the baseline sequence changes, but the base has changed in four four, and the melody is five. So wherever those, that melody lands is always different. So it makes it very interesting, you know, and to that I added guitar later, but yeah, it's never like extremely multilayer in the sense that I'd never, probably because of the instruments that I use and how I use them. I feel like it's so much emotionally and sonically out of them when you do one take that I never feel like I have to add that much to it.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Allesandro: </b>
      You know, I mean, if I'd have to the most look at the most complex session that I have, either from the new record or previous record, including, you know, I have 3 cents in returns for effects, which are an AMS RMX 16 reverb aged 3000, even tied as a 3000 S and in AMS DMX, 15 ATS delay. So those take up, you know, three stereo channels. I think the rest was probably 10 other channels. It was five stereo pairs. So, you know, it looks like, it's a very compact situation. It's just, it's these instruments have such a personality. That, to me, it's very easy to fill up space sonically and by consequence emotionally with them, you know what I mean? So then I don't feel the need to have to add a lot of things nor edit, because I've been doing the, the live one instrument thing for so long that I got to a point that when I'm pressing record, I'm not demoing anymore. I know that that might become, they will most likely become something one day. So I'm pretty confident of what I'm recording. It's not just a sketch anymore. You know what I mean? Sure. The
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Other nice thing about that is that you don't end up picking the part, your own work. I know, I certainly know this for myself. One of the worst things I can do is take something and decide that I'm going to produce it, you know, with quote marks on it, because, inevitably what I'll do is I'll squeeze all of my enjoyment track </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Too. Yeah, I agree. And even
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Allesandro: </b>
      That, you know, it's not, I'm not here to say that all of that is wrong. I think if, if, if, if we approach it in a constructive way, like, say for example, I worked on this since I was in a certain amount, in a certain way, let me see if I can make it sound better. So it'd be more of an engineer, mix it and do stuff like that, you know, but if I make a conscious decision of switching from one position to the other, then the creative part is not going to be as influenced or damaged by the following one, because I'm already approaching another way. But it's tough though, because obviously trying to be a child and making music, you know, in a creative way to makes me feel good. Rationality, it's definitely not the first thing that is next to me. You know, it's definitely not my, my assistant, you know, when I'm making music, you know? Sure.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>So, one of the things that I really appreciated is that all of the tracks here, in this release, all of them kind of feel of a set. So it's kind of interesting to hear that you kind of like pick them from different places. They all kind of, kind of feel, of a set though. And to me, the things that are kind of the, the through lines are sort of this, this dark and heavy, pads that kind of, to me are typical of, of a lot of your music, but also the use of like really simple sequences as kind of, kind of a melody kind of an ostinato kind of a, hypnotizing factor, maybe even to the tracks. And I'm curious, you use a wide variety of, of systems. What are you, what are you doing the sequencing on? Is this something that you use just the little sequencers that happened to be built into the boot glow or built into, into little, little modular systems? Or do you have a more specific sequencing tool that you tend to use? How, how do you do part sequencing?
      </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Allesandro: </b>
      When I write it's usually when, when the idea comes, when I write, when something comes, it usually comes from the direct relationship one-on-one with one instrument. So if that instrument has a sequencer, it's usually to built in, built in sequencer, I have a, you know, a sequent ticks circle on that I use as a media interface and as a control for the whole studio. But to be honest, I hardly ever use it as a control when it comes to like sequencing the whole studio with it. Occasionally I might have not because I don't like it. It's just because if I had machines that didn't have a sequencer, then yes, I probably would use that exclusively because then you have everything in one place it's very convenient. Each, each instrument is controlled by the same set of rules, it would make sense. But I think that sequencing and, you know, especially in dance instruments and localized instruments and, you know, like on the spray gun and, you know, or the control, the zero control, you know, no control, they're all implemented so differently that the sequencer itself becomes an instrument within the instrument.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Allesandro: </b>
      You know? So the way it, within those modules or within that set of elements in an instrument makes it one with the instrument itself. I think it's very important for me to do that. Like for example, the CMP, you know, the EMS, the Ks of the AKF, the Ks, the keyboard sequencer, that one is a really cooky sequencer in the sense that, you know, it's basically a memory recorder, you know, it has a certain amount, I think it's two 56 steps. You don't hear them, you can just choose the tempo, but you don't hear that. And then you record something, you press play and you play back that phrase, it changed, but it's very hard to make something in time. There'll always be something that is either galloping or, you know, there's, and that's the cool thing about it. You know, the sequence in that case allows you to create voices that are very different from what it would, if you would just have a 60, let's say, 16 step sequencer, that just goes to a clock, you know, same thing with ***<inaudible>*** by rolling, you know, it's definitely not the sequencer that I use when I'm thinking I have a sequence in my head and I want to get it down, which hardly ever happens.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Allesandro: </b>
      I just do octaves. I literally mashed the buttons, Nash, randomly the octave and the slides. And that's our record. Like ***<inaudible>*** came to me. It was the quirkiness of the input method of the instrument that shaped the note output, you know, and I liked that because, you know, we talked about this, it's a chess game with the machine. I think the machine really becomes the grammar that I, that I utilized to speak my language, essentially.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>It also does kind of throw back to what you said in our previous interview where we're sort of like working on systems from a developer, it makes sense to you because it makes sense as an instrument, it makes sense as an environment to sort of like, embed yourself into, right. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Allesandro: </b>
      Yeah, exactly. I feel, you know, and I know there's, and I totally respect, you know, people that have much more complex Cintas systems where they enjoy adding things and just, you know, going down a path of adding things that have more complex things. I just never been. I mean, arguably, if some people would look at my systems and think there are complex as well, but what I'm saying is, I usually stop very early in the process when it comes to being satisfied with what I do. It just, you know, I hardly ever come up with a patch that is very intricate. It might be several voices or several parts, but so as a whole, am I be considered, you know, considered an intricate patch, but in general, it's it's, to me, it's very simple.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Right? The other thing that, that to me is sort of a hallmark of your sound is really creative use of affects and of audio processing this album, again, sort of like features a heavy and distorted sound on a lot, on pad sounds again, something, I think that people kind of recognize a little bit as your sound, right. What is the mechanism that you use to do that? Is it, do you have external boxes? Do you use like guitar pedals and stuff to do that? Or do you find ways to overdrive it within the systems? How do you, or do you like Overdriver recorder? How do you get to that, to that sound, </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Allesandro: </b>
      All three things that you just mentioned at different times? I would think that the overdrive is, I think for the most part, part of the instrument. So something like the Synthi, for example, each stage can be overdriven, you know, the output of the oscillator into the filter, the filter into the amp, the amp into the reverb, all those stages. If you go to 10 with the knob it's overdriven, so that adds different kind of vibe to everything it's not necessarily distorted, but it's definitely saturation. You know what I mean? And so that becomes part of the patch, part of the sound for me, I haven't really used guitar pedals for distortion. As much as I used to, I use a module called the it's made by a company called overstep. It's a rack unit, and it's called the modular channel, which is a stereo mic pre line line processing compressor.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Allesandro: </b>
      Ecoo filter like Korg Ms. 20 style, high pass, low pass filter. It's just very creative. It's a very creative box. I use it a lot, you know, see you both for clean things. And for distorted things like there's a piece on the Voluma Massimo called Sabia, which is basically just, you know, a live performance in the studio that then I processed in real time on that, on that box basically. But yet for the most part, I saved the machines that I use tend to have that character. That's sort of like, all the little, you know, just leave me alone. I'm a little broken. Right.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>But the other thing that I'll notice that, and you can tell me where this comes from is that so I'm, I'm listening to digital copies of stuff and there's noise floor to your recordings. And it's something that we're not used to now in like quote, modern recording that stuff is like scrubbed out. Right. And, that seems to be very much a part of what you did as part of the development of the release. Is that, is that some natural part of your recording system or is that something that you add as kind of blue to work across tracks out where's where's that noise or come from, because I'll tell you a lot of times I'm listening to digital the digital recordings, and it sounds like I'm listening to a cassette release. It's got that kind of, </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Allesandro: </b>
      Yeah. I'm really attached to sure. Yes. Yeah. It's something that will never go away. And I think it's, it's emotionally linked or tied to, to the way that I, you know, enjoy music. Luckily all the machines that I have already have their own like noise floor. So I hardly ever feel have the need to inject it, but like in attract like a chiaroscuro, there is noise that starts the whole piece basically, which is, you know, through, through a band pass filter. I think noise is very important as a, as glue, you know, as basically a way to unify everything. It's one of those things that generally speaking and attract you wouldn't realize it's there unless you knew, you know, reviewed it and you go, well, something's missing now, you know? And, to be honest, I mean, I grew up with noise obviously because of the medium that I was using to enjoy music for the most part of my youth.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Allesandro: </b>
      But yeah, I guess I, well, CDs were just as long, but, but I have to say that part of it was definitely inspired by the, by the work of trans work on, the downward spiral or things like that. When I got a chance to take a look at the sessions, you know, there were full tracks of noise that would go through through the whole song, you know, but you didn't know that, like, I would know that listening to the record, but when I look at the tracks, I realized that they were there, you know what I mean? And it was, you know, it was very inspiring because you realize the relationship, you know, the relationship of noise within sound, you know, and how it, it is part of it. You know? I mean, it's crazy how on one end, we're trying. And I do too, because, you know, I I'm quite an audio file when it comes to listening to music. So I enjoy devices that allow me to, you know, enjoy music at its purist, but when I make it the opposite. So it's kind of a, it's a weird, you know, it's a weird situation.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Yeah. I, I get it while at the same time, I mean, being purposeful about your noise floor, again, it's one of those things that becomes kind of a Sonic signature too, you know? So I think that that's, I think there's a lot of important than a lot of value in that now. One of the things I think a lot of people will know about you is that you are a pretty adept guitar player as well. But one of the things I would say this release, especially you mentioned already that there was some guitar work in there. I wouldn't be able to tell you where I have no idea how guitar fits into this kind of Sonic landscape. How do you approach using a guitar in something that is kind of a, what I would see as a synth record? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Allesandro: </b>
      Well, you know, I was, I started as a guitar player and, I was really infatuated and, inspired by the, you know, like the metal hard rock shred sheet scene growing up, you know, I was really into fast Qatar playing and to a certain extent even do I enjoy it, it's sort of also prevented me. And this is a personal thing, but prevented me to, to develop a personal dial up with the instrument because, you know, you're so inspired by certain musicians that you think that's what you need to be or how you need to play. And, and, and I think I took that the wrong way and, and it, it made my development a lot slower, you know, until I realized that guitar, wasn't the main instrument. I wasn't too sound in general, not sound linked to one instrument exclusively. So the last few years, especially since, I would say 2017 when, since I joined nine inch nails, really, but more like in the last few years when I've done more bass and guitar for them live, I've sort of rekindled my love with my old guitars and the old idols and the old things, but, and I've tried to integrate guitar in a way that it's not that, you know, like, not that there's anything bad, but you know, I can't be shredding over this.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Allesandro: </b>
      That was just doesn't work. It's just not economic in order for it not to be oil and water. Cause that's how it feels when it's something that I learned to play in a certain way for so long, it's a DNA level. That's what guitar is. I pick it up, I'm just starting noodling. You know what I mean? And so it's taking a while to make it fit with the, the quote unquote new me that does, you know, the current means that does electronic music. But I think it's getting there because I feel like I'm able to make them dialogue in a way where as you say, sometimes you, I mean, you don't know which one is which, because guitar might become a third voice of a voice since sequence and, you know, but it's, it's recorded and shaped sonically to be part of it.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Allesandro: </b>
      So it's not imitating, but it's in the same realm. You know what I mean? So, you know, is effected and processed in a way where it feels like, you know, and a big inspiration for guitar tones in this world was a, you know, a band called belong from, new Orleans. And their album, October language was, you know, to me, was a Seminole when it comes to approach and think of guitar in different terms, you know, there's a little bit, well, maybe they would say a lot, but there's a little bit of my bloody Valentine guitar approach, you know, which is more of a, a cloud where you can't really hear the picking. And it's more about, you know, an entity which is made by a guitar and it's just moving towards you. And so that was a little bit eye-opening and helped me to step away from my idea of, of, at the time of guitar playing. Interesting.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>That's really interesting, but it also, it also makes perfect sense and it, this idea of, of guitar having the potential of being oil and water and these kinds of things, I mean, that really resonates with me because again, I was a guitar player initially too, and it's been very hard for me to find a way to make that fit because it's so easy to fall into everything I did when I was a guitar player to be like the people that I, and so that makes sense. That makes an awful lot of sense. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Allesandro: </b>
      Exactly. It's a, it's a pitfall, but it's inevitable because I also don't want to sound like I'm talking trash about guitar. I love guitar, and it's such a unique instrument that is so natural to come up with that sort of voice on yesterday. You know, so when you're trying to adapt it, I don't think that, you know, electronic music with guitar on top sound good. It's not my thing. You know, like, I just, I think they're fighting and also culturally, you're never going to get electronic music people, not that it matters, but between joy guitar, music and vice versa guitar is, are very narrow-minded. I'm sorry to say, but you know what I mean? It's all about the amp and niggas. There's not much, you know, there's pedals of course nowadays, but you know what I mean? It's a very, very closed universe.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>I I'm telling you. I, when I sort of started getting tired of guitar was actually in, in kind of the late eighties, early nineties, when what you kind of saw was all the keyboard players are trying to sound like guitar players and all of the guitar players who were trying to sound really robotic, like keyboard players. I was like, everyone's lost the picture. Yeah. But that's sort </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Allesandro: </b>
      Of like what's happening now with modular. I think, you know, for a certain extent, like, I mean, I always compare the current modular scene to the shred scene of the nineties where it all started with iconic players, like whoa, and one iconic player, Edward van Haley, you know, you know, it was Seminole in the, in the technique and the plane, but let's not forget wrote hit after hit, after hit, after hit as a band. So yes, he was an incredibly innovative guitar player that inspired tons of people, but also it also revolutionized songwriting, you know, van Halen was a standout, one of the biggest us song, writing bands, you know, but what happened is just tons of clowns came out. People that took whatever he was doing and did it faster, did it louder than it, you know, I mean, I remember seeing guitar magazines where they were selling, you know, picks, they would make you pick faster or things to like, you know, to, to exercise your fingers, to get, you know what I mean?
    </p>

    <p>

      Like things like, or eight finger tapping, like, you know, like taking it to an extreme, which was interesting, but also didn't have any of the soul or the direct dialogue with the, with the, with the listener that Edward van Halen hats and the same thing is happening now with Iraq and to me and, and that sort of world, you know, because we're going from trying to establish a dialogue with a limited set of tools to just going from, from module to module, just exploring a little bit here and there. It's just like, you know, there's so many things to keep us interested in that world. At the end of the day, you kind of lose track of what you're doing is just a ton of sounds and not much of a common thread between it, between them. You know what I mean? It might, that's my opinion.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Allesandro: </b>
      It might be an old, you know, I am an old, you know, an old van, but what I, what I mean is I, I do believe that, you know, the amount of tools get in the way of the ability for musicians, no matter what the instrument, in this case, we're talking about synthesizes and modules, it gets in the way of musician to be able to create their own voice. Cause their own voice comes from learning on an instrument, a limited set of tools. I remember, you know, you would buy something new. So whatever, because you read something about it in a magazine, you bought it. You did, first of all, you read about it or maybe there was an album where you thought that's what they were playing. There were a thousand videos on YouTube that already kind of sucked the soul out of it.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Allesandro: </b>
      And by the time you get it, you, you can already what it sounds like. So there's no, even like, I mean maybe DM boxing is, you know, exciting, but there's not any of the, I remember buying my first microwave, not the, I mean the Waldorf, you know, like I don't think anybody remembers their first microwave oven, you know? And I remember not really knowing what was happening, cause I kind of have an idea of what it was, but you know, it just, it was such a new thing. It wasn't like, oh, let me check a video. You know? And I'm guilty of the same thing. Like right now I explore a lot of videos and you know, what happened is it sucks even more is that you get the thing, you open it, play with it a little bit and then you go back to watching videos about it. Yeah.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Instead of just sitting there and exploring it more, right? Yeah. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Allesandro: </b>
      It's almost like we're addicted to this world of snacks where, you know, there's incident, incident things, infinite content, but there's never a chance to establish a deeper dialogue and can get more nutrition for one single element. You know, like the album buying a record, the idea of being able to buy something and have it. It's stuck, you bought it with your friends and one bought the cassette. You original, if you put more money, you kept your original cassette and then the others would copy it and make a photocopy of the cover. Right. And then you've listened to it. And it was so, so, but then it was stuck in your car stereo for the whole summer. So if I listened to that, now I remember everything about that summer songs. Bring me back in a certain to a certain time, you know, that doesn't exist anymore because you don't have to, there's always something new that you can skip to, whether it's a, a video on YouTube, whether it's a song on the streaming services or whether it's an instrument or a module. And I think, I think it's limiting instead of being what people think it is, which is freeing and, and endless possibility. I think it's very limited because it avoids and prevents you from tapping your real credit sheet, creativity, your real voice, finding your real voice. Interesting.

      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>So now one of the things said that is actually though part of this album is maybe the ultimate of like tweaking your way into understanding an instrument. And if that's your development of the, the stringer instrument with make noise a couple of weeks ago, we talked with Tony and he talked about his side of the, of the building process, but I'm curious to hear what it was like for you. What was the process, what did the process feel like for you and what did you feel like you were trying to accomplish and building your own instrument? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Allesandro: </b>
      When the process was a three-year long, incredible relationship? You know, we were friends already, Tony and I and Kelly. And so I was part of the make noise, you know, clan. And I had been for quite a while and there was already an affinity, both as friends, but, and also when it comes to the world of instruments and on top of it, Tony and I have always improvise with ideas, whether it was something that ended up being an instrument, but it could be anything like we would joke and we'd go on. We really liked to talk to each other, which I think is essential for it, to, for us to be having been able to do what we did. The concept behind it was that Tony was always interested in how I make music and how I get whatever I get out of specific instruments.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Allesandro: </b>
      So, and, and to me, obviously it would have been ideal to create an instrument that was a representation of my Sonic aesthetic. And, and, that would allow me to be quicker at creating statements that, that I felt were more in line with, with, with what I feel without having to dig too hard and other machines, you know, and the strike ended up being that now key to that is, is a, is a process and it really applies to everything. It applies to what I just said about finding your own voice, you know, as a musician and being inspired, instead of emulating others, the same thing applied to making an instrument, then example that I make is something like if you remember analog systems, when they came out with those modules that were inspired or inspired, there were modules taken from the Sinti.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Allesandro: </b>
      They had the envelope, they had the filter, they have the viscose, and they were interesting because they sort of showed you a look of what those instruments have, but the magic of the city is not the trapezoid. It's not the filter, it's not the oscillate, it's them together within that world. With that specific, you know, the crappy knobs built-in speakers, it's the whole, so early on, we understood that. It wasn't about, alright, let me take this element from the easel. Let me take this element from the Cynthia, let me take this element from the booklet 200 and put them together. So it's a Frankenstein, the version of the instruments that I liked the most, but what is it about the easel that makes me come out with these things, with these ideas? What is it about the same thing that makes me come out with the sound?
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Allesandro: </b>
      You know, it was extrapolating the reason behind the process more than extrapolating the technical aspect of the machine. So, it was a wider research, but also once we understood that that was the process was a much more successful harvest in the sense that we were able to understand what was happening to me, for example, the Cynthia, as I said, one of the main things was overdrive. You know, the overdrive, it was just stages, which has been implemented. People might not think about it, but on different stages on the street as well. So, there's a lot of that that is at the core of the trigger sound and, the noise, the noise that comes from that specific, you know, delayed chip that we've used that sort of like adds that noise, whether you like it or not, it's just there, you know what I mean?
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Allesandro: </b>
      It took a while, obviously it's not like we came out with this design and boom, it was like that three years later there were different iterations. And I, we did spend a week together in person in Asheville in 2018 where we prototyped and went back and forth. And actually, I just told Tony the other day that I found some sketches of printouts of what we thought about. And it was just funny to look at those things now and go, wow. I mean, what became of it, you know, but I mean more of the stories that I got the prototype, you know, right in the middle of, you know, working on the record, so, or compiling the record. So it was very easy for me to integrate it both as a processing device, because the whole idea behind staying I was, you know, and I say this also on the manual, it's like it's to be able to, it's the equivalent of leaving something under the sea for 30 years and then pick it up if you live like a spoon or a piece of metal or something, when you find it years later, it's a, it's not even about the rust.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Allesandro: </b>
      It's more about the waves of, you know, some of the sharp corners now are curves and there's a patina on it and it's not necessarily bit reduced or crushed. It's not about that. It's giving a personality and a story to things. They might have a different story to begin with. You know, so I've simple sequence where a guitar part, all of a sudden, are putting on this new suit, this new dress, you know, and, and I think it's, it's, just as good as that as it is that creating sound from scratch, obviously, because as it moved in oscillator, obviously that allows you to use it as a, as a source
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Right now. The thing is that was, it was also fit into kind of the form factor that the no cost and the no control fit into, was that a natural fit, or did you find that stuff had to be like squeezed and, or the UI changed? Because to me a instrument like that, the layout of the knobs is just as important as what's going on with the circuitry, because that's, that's the human machine interaction. That's kind of critical. And it's, I was going to say, when you talk about blue cloud, you very seldom talk about the circuitry. You almost always talk about how it feels, how it, how you manipulate it and how it kind of manipulates you.</i>

      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Right. Not so much right. True cares </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Allesandro: </b>
      About in their activity. And that's exactly what Don was thinking about. And I think Tony does that too, to a certain extent, he thinks first about the way it's going to look, or, you know, how, or early on to go back to your question from a complex prototype of wanting to have a touch plate and maybe a sequencer and record your sequences and whatnot. And this and that. We started thinking, hold on a second, this is not just me and you creating something. We, this is a make noise instrument. It's a collaboration. So why don't we take advantage of what's there already? So we will need a sequencer. I knew at the time that he was working on, we knew that he was working on a no control. So we knew that we could count on that form factor for that. So at that point, it made sense.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Allesandro: </b>
      It's like, wait, but then there's no media, do we want to put me well, hold on a second. Well, then if we don't need media and we don't need, there'll be another control, then I think it's realistic to expand and have the less stuff laid out in a more natural way. So you don't have to be all tiny with your fingers trying to move stuff and boom, the patch is gone, right. And just delegate or delegate take advantage of the, of those features that are already in other parts of this family, this format. So you can also expand if you want to. I mean, I think the Stryker is a great standalone system, but you know, if you can actually come up with something like this and, you know, a little modular search style case where it has, you know, all three where you have zero control, the not control the strike and no coast.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Allesandro: </b>
      Now all of a sudden you have a system with really a sequence and the next roster later, and an extra envelope, you know, there's a, it's a much more complex system than it was before. So early on, we started taking advantage of that, you know, way of thinking. And I think it was liberating because it made it easier to feel more satisfied about the standalone factor of the strike within that environment. We would have been silly not to do it that way, to be honest. It just, it made more sense because I also want it to be battery powered, but then it made more sense to think about a way to power two modules and then have a battery pack if you need to, as opposed to have a battery pack inside the instrument. But I think it's all things that, you know, develop through dialogue.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Allesandro: </b>
      And on one end, you add me, as I said, like a child just being, you know, very excited and, and coming up with things that are on the other hand, you have someone that has done this for a long time. Like Tony being able to sort of filter what I was saying and telling me we can do this, or we can't do that. Or we can do this, but this way, I mean, it got frustrating at times I would think. But I mean, I think it was more him frustrated with sometimes I would say things that were completely out of this world, try to make sure it's like Tony, I'm sorry if I'm saying this, this up so excited. You know what I mean? But I mean, I can't tell you how much of a different feeling it is to release something like this. Cause, you know, I mean, I'm lucky too that I have a very strong connection with people who listen to my music because I know that being instrumental, they're able to sort of, you know, project their own emotional response to it, as opposed to like say a song that is, that has lyrics, which has a content, you know, a more marked subject, but now releasing an instrument, it's almost like there's an extra layer because obviously the instrument is part of me, but to be tagged and seeing all these people on Instagram or YouTube, you know, coming up with their own thing or like people like Sarah Belle Reed that did a whole EAP with it, you know, like not like it, she was inspired to write with it.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Allesandro: </b>
      And then, you know, they will be next month and now boom, in July of artists that made music exclusively with Australia, you know, that integrated in there, you know, there'll be Ben frost, ***<inaudible>*** Martha ***<inaudible>*** Rob Lowe. Can't remember a lot of it. Moresby knows that drum cell, it was a little bit of a problem at the beginning. Cause you always, I mean, I'm thinking it's such a personal instrument. I hope it won't be like a me in a box where people are just going to do whatever and they'll come out with like a four note sequence that they won't be able to switch off

    <p>
      <b>Allesandro: </b>
      Or, or something that is too noisy. Cause I mean, from the beginning, like pretty early on, Tony looked at me and looks like, you know what? This is a very noisy instrument. So we kind of early had to decide, are we going through with this or not? You know, because it was a very, but within the spectrum of what make noise was offering, it did make sense because there was nothing that did that. So if someone rightly so might say this rig is too noisy for what I like doing like no problem, there's the no code. So there's modules in their world, which are more, less noisy, let's say it that way. So there's, there was that fear, but, and I think that can really be planned in a sense that we couldn't really sit down and design something that would sell well. I mean, unless we would have put wooden size on it, cause then, you know,
    </p>

      This was grant Richter. I remember grant, at the time when I was designing an instrument that never came out, we Tony as Scott Yeager, I was talking to grant because grant sold me. My first diesel and grant told me, you know, what, if you want it to sell, just put wooden side. Okay. So you put some wooden solid woods sides of it because you remember even Dawn when released the booklet 200, he got so much, so many people complain about the fact that he was putting not a grade plywood, which, you know, it's strong, arguably it's stronger, you know, the normal word and lighter because he thought people are going to tour with this play shows. They want it to be lighter frame. It made sense. You know what I mean? There was a reason it wasn't cheap. You know, it wasn't because it was cheap. But I remember sound on sound and others complaining about, well it costs 20 grand and it's plywood.

      <b>Darwin: </b>
