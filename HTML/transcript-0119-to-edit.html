<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. I like it when something a little different comes across the table. Thanks a lot Jane <span style="color:red" data-ts="16.085" data-end_ts="16.365" title="16.085" id=c_"16.085">__Riggler__</span> for sort of the pointer to this. I think you're gonna love it and, when it's all over, make sure that you go check out the site related to this thing, but it's fantastic. Enjoy. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. This week we have, I have the opportunity to introduce you and introduce myself to somebody that I've not met, but I've been hearing a lot about lately. His name's Bruce Oland and he's involved in a project called The Tank. The Tank is, a very special acoustic space, and, they're in the process of making it a performance space. It's located out in Western Colorado, but it sounds really special. They recently had a Kickstarter campaign that's successfully funded for helping the thing come up to speed, and I think now they've got some big plans that they <span style="color:red" data-ts="72.845" data-end_ts="73.005" title="72.845" id=c_"72.845">__wanna__</span> put together. So, with that, I introduce you to Bruce Oland. Bruce, how you doing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bruce Odland: </b>Good morning, good afternoon, and whatever time zone you're in 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, right? Indeed. Morning for me too. So, why don't we start off, I'm going to, put links and stuff into the podcast notes, but why don't we have you give us a brief introduction into what the tank is about? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bruce: </b>Well, first of all, what is the tank in Back in the Steam era, they had these huge, tall tanks, much larger than what they use now for water tanks or fracking tanks or any of that stuff. It's almost 70 feet tall and about, 40 feet across a cylinder with a dome on top and a reverse dome on the bottom. So it's half inch steel and it's old steel, and it's, sitting up on the dirt hills outside of Rangeley Colorado. Now, inside that it has the most marvelous reflections and reverb without too much slap <span style="color:red" data-ts="135.725" data-end_ts="136.005" title="135.725" id=c_"135.725">__back__</span> echo. So it's very intelligible. It's like up to 40 seconds of reverberation, but it also has its own harmonic content. It's like an overtone series in there that could shift your notes and spin them around. It's the most gorgeous dimensional, physicalized sound that I've ever heard. And you're kind of standing in the center of this and it, it's a little bit cathedral-like, but maybe times 10 <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, I was gonna say, I'm not sure that I've ever in real life experienced a 42nd, reverb time. That's, that had to be amazing the first time you stumbled into it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bruce: </b>So the first time I stepped in there, it's like your footstep lasts 11 seconds, so all of a sudden you're in a completely different time axis. It's like your time axis stretches out beyond recognition, and there's very little visual input in there because maybe it sounds like an ultra cathedral, but it's a dark steel tank and you can't even tell how big it is, right? So your eyes are starved and your ears are getting more ear food than you've ever run across before in your life, you know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, right? So, how did you, how did you run across this? I mean, you know, a, a tank that big is probably pretty obvious in the landscape, but what made you say, huh, I wonder what that sounds like inside? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bruce: </b>It didn't really happen like that. I was on a tour of, small towns in Colorado with 60 other artists called the <span style="color:red" data-ts="230.475" data-end_ts="230.765" title="230.475" id=c_"230.475">__Chau__</span> Tour. I was making sound portraits of all of the towns and playing them back for the townspeople as a pre-show to this art, traveling art, group. And so I was the guy with the earphones and the microphones going everywhere, <laugh>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="245.365" data-end_ts="245.405" title="245.365" id=c_"245.365">__And__</span>, this four-wheeler, drove up to me and said, Hey, hop in. We got something to show you. Are you the sound guy? Yeah. And so, I hopped in and they drove me up into the oil fields and I was thinking, whoops, bad idea, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bruce: </b>And then they showed me this tank said, climb in, turn up your recording gear. So I climbed in through this porthole and I had my recording gear going on, and they struck you outside of the thing with two by fours, which was pretty alarming because, you know, my, my dials were totally in the red and my earphones were up pretty high. I had no idea what they were going to do. So I came back that night with subtler instruments and explored the space. You know, you at that time, you could only get in through a porthole, so you could only bring in long thin instruments. Okay. So I've been coming back there ever since then, making recordings with a small group of, like a band of musical gypsies and sound artists. And, gradually and eventually we saved the place from destruction in, 2013 with the Save the Tank Kickstarter. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bruce: </b>Then we got a road built power brought in, control room, in a container right next next to it. And we've been fixing the place up and getting it ready, because when we saved it, we thought, yeah, we've been out there, you know, illegally using this place for years. Maybe we can fix it up and let people use it for real to have their own experiences. First of all, first of all, it's like a, a sense altering experience to be in sound that rich, right? It affects everybody, and it brings your imagination to the place where music comes from. Not to, not to the place where you buy it. It doesn't take you to the Apple store, it doesn't take you to the CD section in Walmart. It takes you to the heart of music and that you yourself are full of music and things you do can communicate and sound beautiful and radiant, and it, it pulls that music out of you. So that transformative experiences at the heart of everything, there's a lot for anybody to learn from in that kind of situation. From a little kid to an experienced sound artist, to a Grammy <span style="color:red" data-ts="384.845" data-end_ts="385.285" title="384.845" id=c_"384.845">__winning__</span> musician, everybody basically has the same response, which is to be in awe in the middle of your sound. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So I am curious what, well, first of all, what changes have you had to make to the tank? You kind of mentioned already having to make some sort of better entrance, but what other changes have you had to make to the, to the tank to actually make it viable as like a performance or a recording space? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bruce: </b>Well, first of all, to allow anybody in there, but our own team, we had to bring the thing up to international code as an assembly hall. Oh my goodness. So there were a lot of humps, of, there were a lot of hoops to jump through. We didn't even know about this. We had to get a change of use permit, which meant formally that place was a closed storage facility. You would have to have special gear to go in there, which we didn't, of course, <laugh>, we just had microphones. Right. Fortunately, we had incredible help from Rio Blanco County, the building inspector there. When we confessed what our plans were, and this was startling to the building inspector Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, and then confessed that we had absolutely no idea how to achieve these plans. Would he school us in what we needed to do in order to do this? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bruce: </b>Then he took on a, a very helpful and active role about what all of the <span style="color:red" data-ts="472.425" data-end_ts="472.645" title="472.425" id=c_"472.425">__di__</span> different moves we'd have to make were, and we just did them one at a time. We had to remove a pipe that went through the middle that was a trip hazard that used to be one of our favorite instruments. So <span style="color:red" data-ts="484.835" data-end_ts="485.125" title="484.835" id=c_"484.835">__with__</span> <laugh>, with each challenge that was coming up here, it's like, okay, how can we turn that into something that's better? Right. So we cut this pipe out and using the equation for a wind chime, blown up to a huge scale, we created this sort of tank galon out of the old pipe, <span style="color:red" data-ts="504.235" data-end_ts="504.525" title="504.235" id=c_"504.235">__just__</span> intonation tank galon that you can play, and it makes the whole place ring. It's like an amazing instrument. It's like the voice of the tank. Now, this, this galon instrument really fun to play. You don't need to know how to do it. You can just try it. You know, so we had to block off the ladder going on the inside, and we turned that into a harp. So the harp will block your access to the, you know, every place along the way that we had to make a change, we tried to turn it into an instrument. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That's, that's actually a really creative way to attack it. Well, and also congratulations to the, to the county for actually being supportive. I know, a lot of friends all over the states who, try to do something creative with a space and, run into exactly the opposite. Just a, a very antagonistic world and an antagonistic bureaucracy that is not helpful. To what extent do you think that, that the county actually saw this as a way to be supportive of the arts? Or do you think it was just a guy being, being cool? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bruce: </b>I think that, they're aware there being, an oil boom and bust, oil and gas boom and bust culture that they need to diversify their economy a little bit, and they're willing to take some risks. You know, they need to find out all across the west, you know, and that stuff that happened in Oregon really shows that the old ways are up against a new sort of way of using the landscape, without exploiting it quite so thoroughly, you know? Right. You find that, ecotourism replacing, mining and extraction types of things. So that type of wave is going across rangely too, even though slowly they're trying to find their way, and about at this time, we come along and we have this crackpot idea that this place could be a international draw. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> for <span style="color:red" data-ts="624.275" data-end_ts="624.565" title="624.275" id=c_"624.275">__this__</span> sort of people who value their ears. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bruce: </b>And it turns out there's a lot of 'em. You know, our first Kickstarter, we had <span style="color:red" data-ts="630.925" data-end_ts="631.205" title="630.925" id=c_"630.925">__eight__</span>, 800 people or so. The second one, 700 people and from 18 different countries around the world in South Africa and, and United Arab Emirates and Finland and Norway and Ireland and South Korea. All these people donated to this idea. You know, it's not like one of those Kickstarters where you get a cool little 3D printer, totally nonobject oriented concept being promoted on Kickstarter. And as a, as a byproduct, or actually as a central product of this, we find our stakeholders around the world who are interested in resonance spaces. And that forms a group of people who are like a interesting block of people, a kind of far-flung community who actually wanna come to Rangeley Colorado. And I think that idea, the German, that idea was present when we presented our change of use permit to the county. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bruce: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And the germ of that idea was always present when we spoke to the Rio Blanco County building inspector and the other folks, and they, they took a chance on us, and we never pretended we knew what we were doing <laugh>. So they are very kind and lovely people out there in Rangely, and it's a part of the state that not many people know. So it's kind of an interesting way to put Rangely on the map as a way. And it's not like people out there actually thought this was gonna work, but they were willing to give it a chance. And now it shows like it's gonna work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, it does. In fact, now you've mentioned having a lot of, or a number of artists out there already. What my assumption is that like myself, most people have not experienced that kind of environment. When you first watch an artist approach the space, how do you notice, do you notice them sort of like changing their approach or changing what they do? Or how do you see them kind of probing the environment to make their own artistic voice out of it? Because it would seem like a space like that would have a very, significant voice. And I'm wondering how artists approach it to allow them their own voice to intertwine with that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bruce: </b>It's kind of interesting as an art process. Sometimes you're working, if you're in the studio and your setup is fairly static and your speakers are fairly static and you're making, you're making some moves and the feedback comes to you from your laptop or your speakers or something that doesn't actually exist in real space, your feedback mechanism is kind of like, do I like that? Is that cool? Should it be longer, shorter kind of technical decisions about how your inspiration has been captured and then what you can do to it? So that's kind of sometimes a little abstract with the feedback coming to your ears is, I made a little move on my mouse and I like it better. But, the feedback in the tank is of an entirely different nature. You're not in charge of it. First of all, you're in it and the feedback is overwhelming. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bruce: </b>It's like a hundred times the amount of feedback you're normally used to getting. Right. Because you're standing in the middle of this big resonant, gooey blob of sound that's swimming through the space, and your first response is, awe, genuine, awe, not awesome dude, but genuine awe. Wow, that's my sound. I can hear the harmonics of what I just did, drifting across the space and changing and evolving. So your brain is just struggling to grasp the nuance of what just happened. And you realize, Ooh, that was me <laugh>. You know? So your, your feedback loop is unlike anything you've ever run across. Sure. And it, is pretty extraordinary. That's, it's a very physicalized, awe inspiring and brain melting experience. So whatever you came in there with is got a partner that's much larger and much more resonant and much more, you realize, okay, I came to, I came to play my trumpet in the tank. Well, there's a concept when you, while you're playing your trumpet, you're realizing the tank is the instrument. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bruce: </b>And I'm playing it with a trumpet or with <span style="color:red" data-ts="908.525" data-end_ts="908.685" title="908.525" id=c_"908.525">__the__</span> drum. I'm playing the tank with my voice. I'm playing the tank with the choir, I'm playing the tank with the cello. It's, you, you never really get that much feedback from the architecture. Yeah, sure. You can change your room sound. You can go into a brick room, you can go into a two second reverb room. You can add a little clip of an opera house, with an impulse response to your laptop, or then, you know, I don't like that opera house. Let's try this opera house. And you're always kind of in command of these decisions, and these little impulse responses are like little postcards of a sound space. Right. It just doesn't measure up to the impact that the tank has on your brain and on your ears and on how you play. So when artists go in there pretty instantly, they're in this space and they have to respond. So they're from the very first sound they're making, they're responding to the tank. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's interesting because the way you're explaining it has just kind of like totally changed my vision of what it's like to deal with it, because, and, and the key was you saying that the tank becomes the instrument. Because if you think of like a drum you have, you know, you excite the head, but it's the body of the drum that kind of is responsible for the sound. Or you take a trumpet, you blow into a mouthpiece, and then the tubing of the trumpet is responsible for the sound. All of a sudden, you and your instrument are just the exciter for this great big space. So instead of it being like, Hey, I'm adding reverb in a typical studio thing, you're actually developing a new instrument by exciting the space in your unique way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bruce: </b>Yes. And then add to that, that as the temperature changes in the tank, the reverb changes <laugh>, the harmonic content changes, and sometimes <span style="color:red" data-ts="1020.215" data-end_ts="1020.435" title="1020.215" id=c_"1020.215">__it__</span>, it's very complex. You certain sounds will go pool and spin around at the top of the tank and a little ball other sounds zip around a perimeter, and you can change it from one thing to the next by making a tiny shift if you're singing in which direction you point your head. Right. So some people, they bring their instruments in there and suddenly they're dancing with the sound in the space, and they've never done that before, you know? Mm-Hmm. Every person responds slightly differently. We're way, we're well beyond, what we can predict here. Right. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I I was gonna say, there's sort of like the chaotic behavior of the space has to be amazing, especially like you say, when the environment actually changes, the changes the room. That's, that's gotta be one of the, one of the positives and negatives of having it be a metal tank, which is that it is gonna actually change significantly with, with temperature and sun angle and all that kind of stuff. Does it have a lot of self <span style="color:red" data-ts="1080.695" data-end_ts="1081.045" title="1080.695" id=c_"1080.695">__sound__</span>? Does it do a lot of creaking and moaning, or is it pretty quiet? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bruce: </b>It's pretty quiet except when it starts to, be activated by really strong wind. And the really strong wind is an, an amazing, awesome sound inside there. It, it just be takes on its own spirit, so to speak. It, it can make some incredibly low frequencies when the wind hits it, in certain ways. Interesting. So, yeah. And then, you know, just like if you step, if you, you can use the floor of the tank as a drum and the whole place just kind of lurches <laugh>. So yeah. It's very, very interactive and, and it's interactive in a way that the impulse responses are not, that's a snapshot. So your impulse response isn't gonna change when the temperature changes 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Right. Right. Now one of the things that hearing about the tank does is it reminds me of my discussions with Pauline <span style="color:red" data-ts="1138.765" data-end_ts="1139.115" title="1138.765" id=c_"1138.765">__Veris__</span> when she talks about the sort of her first experience with the concepts of deep listening as she entered this cistern in the North, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1148.865" data-end_ts="1149.475" title="1148.865" id=c_"1148.865">__Northwest__</span> or west somewhere. And, and she kind of talked about, you know, about the experience and the changes that it made to her music. And, that CI has been used a number of times and, and, but it, because it's buried, it seems like it actually probably has less of an environmental I interaction than the tank does. Do you know much about the deep listening project or deep listening things that Pauline leads? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bruce: </b>Not as much as I'd like to, even though she's just up the river for me. Yeah. I think I have to solve that because, it's, it comes up again and again. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I bet. I'll bet it does. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bruce: </b>I've heard, Stewart's trombone recordings in the cistern and, you know, it's, it's gotta have some, ever since people have been on the planet, we've been playing in caves in resonant spots and, finding <span style="color:red" data-ts="1205.005" data-end_ts="1205.355" title="1205.005" id=c_"1205.005">__still__</span> lag tights that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1206.575" data-end_ts="1206.795" title="1206.575" id=c_"1206.575">__the__</span> ring and can be tuned to the resonant frequencies of a cave and playing music in the dark in these sorts of places and combined with dance and, ritual. And so I think with these types of spaces, you regain something that's been lost or purposefully manipulated in the music industry where music is supposed to be just a product that can be purchased in a certain style and not <span style="color:red" data-ts="1233.995" data-end_ts="1234.115" title="1233.995" id=c_"1233.995">__a__</span> authentic voice of a human being involved with their own sense of discovery and purpose and a sound coming out of them that means something to them. Not just a cultural signifier with a certain type of beat Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bruce: </b>That supports a certain type of product or video game or movie. But, and, and even, you know, a singer songwriter Yes. Confessional Yes. Fits neatly into a category which can be found on, on the internet and et cetera, et cetera. This is completely different. This is more like going into the cave, and I'm sure that the cistern shares some of that experience where you remember actually what music is and what kind of shamanic power it has, what kind of spirit and presence it has, how it reflects either your insecurity or your security, your openness or your closedness. All of that comes back in the tank, and I'm sure it does in a cave, and I'm sure it does in the cistern. So we're talking about really early roots of music here, but experience now in this century with current technology. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, I think, yeah, I think this almost harmonic resonance with, with our past and our evolutionary past is something that, you know, I, I know it's something that, that Pauline certainly feels with the deep listening thing, and it seems like that has been your calling with, with the Tank as well. It's, it sounds amazing. I wanna talk a little bit about people that have performed in there, including yourself. You mentioned that you've kind of turned pipes and ladders and stuff into instruments, but what other instruments have been brought into the, into the tank as sort of like ex siters or what, you know, what are, what are some of the performances that have been done in there? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bruce: </b>Well, very early on, Ron Miles, the wonderful, trumpet master from from Denver came with his trumpet, and that was an amazing sound. And his ears are, are quite amazing. So he fell into tuning with it right away. Michael Stanwood has brought his Buzz Band project there and made a nice album called Portal there. Tom Wasinger, who's I guess won three Grammys, for his music production, brought a weissenborn <span style="color:red" data-ts="1384.045" data-end_ts="1384.245" title="1384.045" id=c_"1384.045">__and__</span> could slide guitar in there, which just sliced the place open. It was just amazing. Right. It is mainly, but as Michael Stanwood says, it's 90% listening. You make a sound and then you listen and it informs you and you make another sound. And it's not like you're trying to play any chops. You could deafen yourself with chops in there. Right. That sort of nervous type of, virtuo virtuoso stuff just turns into noise real fast, so Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bruce: </b>You know, then people singing in there, there's a local group of people who sing. And then, then over the years we've gone out with a group of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1420.495" data-end_ts="1420.845" title="1420.495" id=c_"1420.495">__Tanko__</span> files where we, you know, we use a whole variety of instruments. Paul Clyde's violin was just amazing and was like a bird flying through the space. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, there, we had a open house in September. As soon as we got our certificate of occupancy, and I would guess you could call these musical pilgrims after a fashion, Sonic pilgrims maybe brought their instruments from far near. Somebody brought this beautiful little instrument they made by pounding nails into a board and stringing rubber bands around these nails so they could retune these rubber bands by moving them around the nails <laugh>. And it activated this little plucky sound activated, 70 foot tall sound waves above it. It was beautiful. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's interesting. And, and it just points out the fact that with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1473.885" data-end_ts="1474.005" title="1473.885" id=c_"1473.885">__a__</span> environment like that, it probably is sort of a dice shake whether something's really gonna work or not, because first of all, like you say, the kind of nervous twitchy, high <span style="color:red" data-ts="1485.415" data-end_ts="1485.765" title="1485.415" id=c_"1485.415">__speed__</span> virtuosity is gonna be the antithesis of what's gonna work in a place like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bruce: </b>But there, there might be some way somebody does that because when, when, tad Klein and his, musical partner brought their Berra in Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> they played quite fast. But since the sounds were little and plucky and then this sort of halo of sound, which sounded like a baroque organ hovering in the space above them, was the collective overtones of this fairly fast moving thing. So I don't think we could quite, can't 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Put a limit 
</p>

<b>Bruce: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1520.625" data-end_ts="1520.845" title="1520.625" id=c_"1520.625">__Our__</span> expectations there yet. As to what, what deafens and, and what lightens and what I'm looking forward to, everybody making their own kinds of experiments there and, really finding out for themselves <laugh>. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I, I would think it would be very difficult to have it be a performance space in the traditional sense where like people could be in there experiencing it with the artist just because having more than a few people would probably just deafen you with like the noise of humanity. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bruce: </b>It's interesting. We had, we had, we can only hold 49 people at a time. That's the rule. Okay. That's our max op. And we had for this improvisatory concert night that just emerged, we had 49 people and then there were another 49 waiting outside. So people were in there for an hour without making a single sound except for this gentle finger rippling that's now the official applause in the tank. 'cause applause would <span style="color:red" data-ts="1586.285" data-end_ts="1586.445" title="1586.285" id=c_"1586.285">__definite__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Right, right. It would be terrible. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bruce: </b>People didn't say a word. People sat at the perimeter and one after another, these sonic pilgrims came out and played. No one said a word. And this was not like your audience of let's say sound arts specialists. This was just <span style="color:red" data-ts="1608.725" data-end_ts="1608.925" title="1608.725" id=c_"1608.725">__the__</span>, the people in Rangeley who <span style="color:red" data-ts="1610.445" data-end_ts="1610.605" title="1610.445" id=c_"1610.445">__are__</span> our neighbors. Right. They came to listen. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And the space itself di directs you to, we, it was amazing. It was a beautiful, beautiful concert and people were gobsmacked, as <span style="color:red" data-ts="1623.565" data-end_ts="1623.845" title="1623.565" id=c_"1623.565">__were__</span>, I was gobsmacked that this worked. So I don't think we can rule out any options right now in terms of what's going to happen there. We just wanna offer it in <span style="color:red" data-ts="1634.485" data-end_ts="1634.605" title="1634.485" id=c_"1634.485">__a__</span> up in a way that can be used and that it's safe and that people can try their ideas and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1641.545" data-end_ts="1641.765" title="1641.545" id=c_"1641.545">__the__</span> the tank will reflect those ideas and we'll find out. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it, it sounds like an amazing, opportunity to work with, like groundbreaking sound. I, I, I really am kind of in awe with the, the dedication that you've put into this and I am a little, I'm a little jealous for the opportunity that you've put together. I'm gonna have to come out there. I have family nearby. I'm gonna have to come out and visit it sometime because it sounds like an amazing place. For the listeners, first of all, where would they go to learn more about the tank 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bruce: </b>Tank sounds.org. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. And for people who missed the opportunity to support the tank through the Kickstarter, is there any other way that they can provide financial support? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bruce: </b>They certainly can. You know, we have a little donate button over at the top right of tank sounds.org and you can find out a lot of stuff there. We'll be updating that. There'll be a mailing list that you can get on. So you'll be among the first to know what we're offering and we'll be opening it at some point in late June. So you can stay tuned, at tank sounds.org. Get on the mailing list. You can donate by PayPal credit card or a check. All that information's at the donate button there. If you we're not slamming the door shut, we welcome you to join us and, we'll definitely give you some rewards there too for your support and we'd be grateful for it. 'cause really we're building up a community of people as this goes on. We find, a lot of people when they sign up for this mailing list <span style="color:red" data-ts="1745.685" data-end_ts="1745.925" title="1745.685" id=c_"1745.685">__that__</span> we're finding, wow, there's a lot of composers on this mailing list. There's a lot of people who are recordists who wanna volunteer in some sort of way. So all these opportunities will be available. We're gonna take a little bit of sleep after the Kickstarter and then start organizing how this thing is gonna work this summer. 'cause now we can proceed. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that sounds amazing and I hope that my listeners will take the opportunity to check it out as well as check out some of the work that's been done there. Bruce, I want to thank you so much for taking time outta your schedule to talk to us. And, I'm wondering if you have any, any last words. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bruce: </b>Well, I hope it's not time for last words <span style="color:red" data-ts="1787.025" data-end_ts="1787.245" title="1787.025" id=c_"1787.025">__for__</span> me. <laugh> <laugh>. I plan to be <span style="color:red" data-ts="1789.125" data-end_ts="1789.445" title="1789.125" id=c_"1789.125">__around__</span> for quite a while last, but I would just say, yeah, all you guys out there who are interested in Darwin's podcast, think with your ears, we're stuck in a visual world. We're stuck behind our screens. Get out there in the world and really listen deeply and think with your ears. You'll be amazed at what you hear. And if you're lucky enough to be in a place like the Tank, what you're hearing is you magnified a hundred times. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Awesome advice. Thank you so much, Bruce, for your time, and have a great day. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bruce: </b>Thanks a lot. Bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, many thanks to Bruce for the chat, the discussion about what it's like to work inside the tank. And for more information about the tank, I hope you will get a chance to go over to tank sounds.org and, take a look at what they're doing. Thanks again for listening. Thanks to all the supporters out there. Thanks to my friends at opia and other places online that help point you towards this place. With that, I'll see you <span style="color:red" data-ts="1861.485" data-end_ts="1861.725" title="1861.485" id=c_"1861.485">__till__</span> next week. Bye.
