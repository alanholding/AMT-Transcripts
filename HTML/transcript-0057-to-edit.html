</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Here's a second recording from that was done during the Thanksgiving break, with my friend Otto <span style="color:red" data-ts="14.42" data-end_ts="14.64" title="14.42" id=c_"14.42">__Nan__</span>. Fantastic guy. One of the nicest people you'll ever meet, but also he has an encyclopedic knowledge of almost everything musical, and he also has some really great ideas about creativity, and particularly how you set yourself up for success when you are trying to put something, new together. So I hope you enjoy this a lot, and, we'll talk to you here at the end of the podcast. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today I have the great pleasure of, speaking with a guy I seem to have known forever, although we haven't spent much time around each other, but every time we do, it seems it's very comfortable. One of the nicest people I know, his name is Zo <span style="color:red" data-ts="63.54" data-end_ts="63.76" title="63.54" id=c_"63.54">__Nan__</span>. And, he is probably most widely known for, his work with collaborators as ozone player. I got to know him through Mike Matley and through Mike's kind of network of, experimental and space type musicians, I find his work really intriguing. He has albums that go back to the beginning of this century, and I just, I've always enjoyed his work and I was really pleased when I reached out to him and he was, he was happy to talk to us on, on the, podcast. So with that, I wanna introduce you to <span style="color:red" data-ts="101" data-end_ts="101.2" title="101" id=c_"101">__Zo__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="101.68" data-end_ts="101.84" title="101.68" id=c_"101.68">__Zo__</span>. How are you today? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso Pakarinen: </b>Hi. I'm fine, thanks. I'm <span style="color:red" data-ts="107.76" data-end_ts="107.88" title="107.76" id=c_"107.76">__a__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="107.94" data-end_ts="108.16" title="107.94" id=c_"107.94">__my__</span> and, relaxing after a hard day's work, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Well, I appreciate you taking the time to talk to us. This is really great for me. I, I love getting a chance to kind of push beyond, my local network of people and mm-hmm. <affirmative>, you are very not local. You're, based out of Helsinki, right? Right 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="133.22" data-end_ts="133.44" title="133.22" id=c_"133.22">__On__</span> on. I'm a local, yes. <laugh>. Yeah, right. I'm local <span style="color:red" data-ts="136.94" data-end_ts="137.16" title="136.94" id=c_"136.94">__in__</span>, I'm, I'm a local in Helsinki. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. There you go. Which luckily now the internet makes you sort of my next door neighbor anyway, so, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>Yeah. Yeah. It's wonderful. <span style="color:red" data-ts="148.02" data-end_ts="148.24" title="148.02" id=c_"148.02">__In__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="148.24" data-end_ts="148.4" title="148.24" id=c_"148.24">__it__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It is. Typically in my podcast, I start off asking people to tell me a little bit about their background. Now you have a really interesting background, so I hope that you'll, kind of dive in and tell us, how you got to be, the person that you are and what you're doing now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>I'll start from, the early seventies. I was, I think 12 years old and wanted to play in <span style="color:red" data-ts="176.08" data-end_ts="176.2" title="176.08" id=c_"176.08">__the__</span> Rock and Roll band, and started playing the electric guitar and with <span style="color:red" data-ts="180.88" data-end_ts="181.16" title="180.88" id=c_"180.88">__formed__</span> several bands in my hometown. And, with that I became hooked in making music and, music has been with me ever since. So I gra gradually moved to keyboards and, found that synthesizers were really <span style="color:red" data-ts="203.06" data-end_ts="203.28" title="203.06" id=c_"203.06">__my__</span> thing. That was towards the late seventies after school. I went to work for a couple of years just to get some money, to get some more gear. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b><laugh>, <laugh>, like, many people like me, <span style="color:red" data-ts="220.42" data-end_ts="220.64" title="220.42" id=c_"220.42">__all__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="220.64" data-end_ts="220.84" title="220.64" id=c_"220.64">__must__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="220.94" data-end_ts="221.16" title="220.94" id=c_"220.94">__pay__</span> money, always has been go going to buying musical gear. And also I started to be interested in, recording so <span style="color:red" data-ts="231.44" data-end_ts="231.64" title="231.44" id=c_"231.44">__that__</span> some tape recorders and also borrowed from friends who had four track or a track, real, real tape recorders. And, started making recordings. Somewhere around the very early eighties, I made some cassette releases, and when I went to Helsinki to study Astronom and, formed a new band immediately, we had a small studio at one point. It was, inside a swimming, swimming pool that was <span style="color:red" data-ts="266.57" data-end_ts="266.92" title="266.57" id=c_"266.57">__empty__</span> <laugh> from water. That, that was kind of the worst studio I <span style="color:red" data-ts="273.56" data-end_ts="273.72" title="273.56" id=c_"273.56">__ever__</span> worked. <laugh>. It was acoustically totally unusable. Right. And the recordings sounded, didn't sound very good. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>And anyway, <laugh> then in the, the mid eighties, I found some, new things that were really interesting, like computer graphics and computer programming. Soon I found that I had dropped out of the university and was working in a video company doing computer video graphics. And in another company, which I started with a couple friends, making, soundtrack music for corporate videos and TV commercials and 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Things 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>Like that. Right. And that's basically the company I'm working. Even today I have <span style="color:red" data-ts="326.04" data-end_ts="326.16" title="326.04" id=c_"326.04">__a__</span> small studio enhancing <span style="color:red" data-ts="328.68" data-end_ts="328.88" title="328.68" id=c_"328.68">__key__</span> that has all the gear necessary for producing music and also animation, motion graphics and video editing and all that stuff. So that's, that's where I, I'm now Sure. Literally <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Right. Yeah. Truly. Boy, that gives me a lot to want to talk about. So first of all, I think it's interesting that you, like, I started off with guitar, but it sounds like you pretty quickly moved to using synthesizers instead of guitars. What was it about the synthesizer that really kind of drew you in? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>I think it, it was the sound, well, electric guitar also had had sound that I wanted to be able to make. And, then I grew up in the early seventies with all these progressive rock Right. Bands like Emerson Lake and Palmer, and Yes. Who used lots of synthesizers. Right. Also Roxy Music with Brian <span style="color:red" data-ts="394.48" data-end_ts="394.64" title="394.48" id=c_"394.48">__Eno__</span>. Oh, yeah. And he <span style="color:red" data-ts="396.28" data-end_ts="396.52" title="396.28" id=c_"396.28">__sold__</span> albums. So the sounds those guys produced were just so interviewing, but I <span style="color:red" data-ts="403.12" data-end_ts="403.28" title="403.12" id=c_"403.12">__really__</span> wanted to have a go at the same stuff. I, I've always been inspired by <span style="color:red" data-ts="410.95" data-end_ts="411.24" title="410.95" id=c_"410.95">__tams__</span>. Right. Sound, soundscapes and, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sound design and stuff. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>Sound, sound design. In fact, more than, actual actually playing technically complex music 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right now. One 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>I I, I've done that. The sound <span style="color:red" data-ts="427.62" data-end_ts="427.84" title="427.62" id=c_"427.62">__is__</span> really what draw draws me into some music <span style="color:red" data-ts="431.84" data-end_ts="431.96" title="431.84" id=c_"431.84">__I__</span>, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="432.48" data-end_ts="432.68" title="432.48" id=c_"432.48">__want__</span> to listen to. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That, that makes sense. When I made this, when I started moving from guitar to synthesizer, a lot of it was based on the availability of sequencers. There was something about being able to sequence so that I could work on music without having to have the whole band in the room. Right. Yeah. Because to me, that was one of the most tiresome things was if I had a piece of music and I wanted to do something with it, I had to, I had to call all the people in the band to get together and then show 'em how it went. And then if it was a failure, then I felt like an idiot. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b><laugh>. Yeah. That's <span style="color:red" data-ts="472.39" data-end_ts="472.88" title="472.39" id=c_"472.39">__another__</span> feeling <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So, but it sounds to me like you actually got into synthesizers before sequencers were widely available. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>Yes. Yeah, thing was, but, we had a band with a drummer, bass player, and two guitar players. And I and the other guitar player both wanted to get our hands on some keyboard equipment, so we bought some, at first we bought one small, I think it was, <span style="color:red" data-ts="504.54" data-end_ts="504.76" title="504.54" id=c_"504.54">__mug__</span> satellites, really basic <span style="color:red" data-ts="507.27" data-end_ts="507.76" title="507.27" id=c_"507.27">__Synthes__</span> synthesizer. Together, we actually had <span style="color:red" data-ts="510.76" data-end_ts="510.92" title="510.76" id=c_"510.76">__the__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="511.08" data-end_ts="511.2" title="511.08" id=c_"511.08">__<crosstalk>__</span>, oh, you, you put it, you put 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="512.78" data-end_ts="513" title="512.78" id=c_"512.78">__And__</span> alternate on it. So one of us played the guitar and the other played the keyboards. So we also get, <span style="color:red" data-ts="520.74" data-end_ts="520.96" title="520.74" id=c_"520.74">__an__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="521.63" data-end_ts="521.92" title="521.63" id=c_"521.63">__Aero__</span> electric in the piano and, <span style="color:red" data-ts="524.87" data-end_ts="525.16" title="524.87" id=c_"524.87">__then__</span> some <inaudible>. So, there were two of us really interested in going that direction. So I guess that made it easier. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Was this, was this all happening? Oh, I'm sorry. Was this all happening in Helsinki at the time? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>No, it, it was a small town called m in the Eastern Penland. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So how, I mean, I'm always curious with, so I grew up in a very rural and distant part of the US and so I know that for me, I had trouble running across synthesizers simply because there were no stores within hundreds of miles. There were no stores that had synthesizers. And so I either had to learn about 'em from bands that would talk about 'em on their album covers or read a magazine or whatever, but I certainly never could see them in person unless I like drove forever. What was, what was the situation for access to equipment for you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>Yeah. We, we didn't, certainly didn't, much of that stuff in our hometown. So we had to learn about it, like you said, from, album colors and from magazines and, and when visiting, bigger towns, going to the Oh sure. Music, e equipment stores. And sometimes we came to Helsinki and, that always included, visits to musical equipment stores. And so it wasn't that easy. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Now, back then, I know that different countries would have kind of different mixes of equipment. So, you know, certainly, in, in Asian countries, what they would have, there would be a, a predominance of like corg and rolling gear, but it was very hard to find like, sequential circuits or Moog gear. What was the gear that you, that was most easy for you to get, and what was the stuff that was impossible? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>Yeah, it, it was more, the Japanese stuff. Okay. So we, we had Rolands and Cos Roland especially was a big name. There were very few nogs. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So what was the first synthesizer that you got that really was exciting to you? Was it that first Moog satellite, or was it something else that really turned you on? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>I, I think the first, really, the first, first syn, that was flexible enough to do actually some sound design was the Roland system. 100 mm-hmm. <affirmative> with its expansion <span style="color:red" data-ts="688.97" data-end_ts="689.32" title="688.97" id=c_"688.97">__board__</span>. That really made a big difference. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Did you have the whole system with the mixer and the sequencer and everything? Well, are we talking about the system 100 or the 100 m 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>At first? The, the older, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The older 100. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>100. Okay. Yeah. Just, keyboard unit and the expansion expander. Right. Expander unit. And then somewhat, later, I, I bought, their first digital sequencer, CSQ 100, I think. <span style="color:red" data-ts="720.42" data-end_ts="720.64" title="720.42" id=c_"720.42">__Oh__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see. Okay. <span style="color:red" data-ts="721.28" data-end_ts="721.48" title="721.28" id=c_"721.28">__It__</span> was, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Because back in the day I had a system 100, and I had had it with the, the keyboard and the expander, but I also had, they had a little eight step sequencer mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And they also had a funny little audio mixer, which actually sounded fabulous because it was really an old school mixer and it distorted really beautifully. It sounded wonderful with that, with that synthesizer, but, yeah. Well, it was a really, I thought it was a really flexible unit. I thought it sounded really good. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>Yeah. Yeah. That, that was the first <span style="color:red" data-ts="754.79" data-end_ts="755.08" title="754.79" id=c_"754.79">__very__</span> flexible I got. We also got a micro <span style="color:red" data-ts="759.15" data-end_ts="759.44" title="759.15" id=c_"759.15">__nobe__</span> at the same time. Right. So we had the roads and on top of that we had the two <span style="color:red" data-ts="766.22" data-end_ts="766.64" title="766.22" id=c_"766.22">__things__</span>, and that was pretty much what was needed for our band. We never really, had a proper organ like <span style="color:red" data-ts="776.28" data-end_ts="776.52" title="776.28" id=c_"776.28">__<inaudible>__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="776.54" data-end_ts="776.76" title="776.54" id=c_"776.54">__so__</span>. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>Any, anything. I think we, both, both of us who played <span style="color:red" data-ts="782.06" data-end_ts="782.28" title="782.06" id=c_"782.06">__the__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="782.28" data-end_ts="782.56" title="782.28" id=c_"782.28">__since__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="782.71" data-end_ts="783" title="782.71" id=c_"782.71">__were__</span> draw more towards, since <span style="color:red" data-ts="785.83" data-end_ts="786.12" title="785.83" id=c_"785.83">__side__</span> of Things and whenever we need some chords. We just used the like, piano. Right. All guitars. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So what, what kind of music were you playing at this time? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>At first we played, pretty complex progressive rock, and towards the late seventies we started to streamline that approach a bit. And with <span style="color:red" data-ts="810" data-end_ts="810.2" title="810" id=c_"810">__those__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="810.2" data-end_ts="810.48" title="810.2" id=c_"810.2">__things__</span>, especially when, more like in the, like year 80 or something mm-hmm. <affirmative>, there were some new bands that were very inspiring for us, like <span style="color:red" data-ts="820.61" data-end_ts="820.96" title="820.61" id=c_"820.61">__Ultra__</span> Walks and d <span style="color:red" data-ts="822.68" data-end_ts="822.8" title="822.68" id=c_"822.68">__d__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="822.83" data-end_ts="823.12" title="822.83" id=c_"822.83">__role__</span>. We started playing some kind of futuristic hybrid of <span style="color:red" data-ts="829.11" data-end_ts="829.8" title="829.11" id=c_"829.11">__<inaudible>__</span> Pop. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Did you ever have vocals or was it all instrumental? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>Yeah, yeah. Yes. The, the other guy also <span style="color:red" data-ts="837.22" data-end_ts="837.44" title="837.22" id=c_"837.22">__was__</span> our main vocals and the bass player and Drum also, <span style="color:red" data-ts="841.31" data-end_ts="841.6" title="841.31" id=c_"841.31">__they__</span> did some backing vocals. I tried doing vocals once, but then I realized that you just, you either have <span style="color:red" data-ts="848.16" data-end_ts="848.28" title="848.16" id=c_"848.16">__a__</span> voice or don't have that <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="852.07" data-end_ts="852.36" title="852.07" id=c_"852.07">__Have__</span> <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I, I agree. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="854.2" data-end_ts="854.32" title="854.2" id=c_"854.2">__I__</span> does have it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I learned, I learned I didn't have vocals skills because people would tell me to stop singing <laugh>. So that's how I knew 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's interesting to hear of some of the people that were influencing you, because I would say that when I listened to Osman <span style="color:red" data-ts="873.64" data-end_ts="873.8" title="873.64" id=c_"873.64">__Player__</span>, I actually listened to your first album a lot, the Insane Logic album. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I got turned into that by Mike Matley, who was like, you've gotta listen to this. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, I listened to it, and the first time through I was like a little baffled because it seemed like the influences were from everywhere. I could hear Tangerine Dream mixed with Yes. Mixed with ultra vx mixed, you know, and now I'm hearing all those names come up as people who <span style="color:red" data-ts="903.3" data-end_ts="903.52" title="903.3" id=c_"903.3">__Yes__</span>. Were influencing you at the time. If we take a look at your work in the Ozone Player, what, who were the bands that were most influential for you in the creation of that music? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>Well, you know, quite right in that, I'm influenced by very many, bands and artists. So, it's might be better to, to be a bit broad about it. Oh, sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>I, I, I started, started with Progressive Rock and then it became the <span style="color:red" data-ts="931.66" data-end_ts="932.08" title="931.66" id=c_"931.66">__string__</span> pop. And also, the electronic bands like Tangerine Dream and also classical music. My father listened to classical music at home. So that's been with me as, <span style="color:red" data-ts="944.78" data-end_ts="945" title="944.78" id=c_"944.78">__as__</span> long as I can remember. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, and that's interesting because where I hear where I would say I hear a classical music influence and, you know, I guess <span style="color:red" data-ts="954.18" data-end_ts="954.4" title="954.18" id=c_"954.18">__pro__</span> rock influence as well, but I tend to think of it as classic is the way that you structure your pieces. They seem to be structured kind of more like, more like classical music than like pop music, I would 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>Say. Yeah. Yeah. That's, intentional. 'cause there's, if you make instrumental music that's not, it's not trying to be pop music and, probably will never be popular anywhere. Right. So it's just more interesting to, steer away from the song song <span style="color:red" data-ts="985.27" data-end_ts="985.56" title="985.27" id=c_"985.27">__like__</span> structures 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. The song form, <span style="color:red" data-ts="987.4" data-end_ts="987.68" title="987.4" id=c_"987.4">__right__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>Like, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="989.82" data-end_ts="990.24" title="989.82" id=c_"989.82">__scores__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="990.91" data-end_ts="991.2" title="990.91" id=c_"990.91">__page__</span> stuff. Right. And, experiment with all kinds of <span style="color:red" data-ts="995.89" data-end_ts="996.24" title="995.89" id=c_"995.89">__songs__</span>, structures, like for example, A, B, C, D, E F g h <laugh>. Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1003.27" data-end_ts="1003.56" title="1003.27" id=c_"1003.27">__That__</span>, that's one, one of my favorites. Nothing's repeating. Right. There <span style="color:red" data-ts="1008.2" data-end_ts="1008.32" title="1008.2" id=c_"1008.2">__are__</span> no <span style="color:red" data-ts="1008.8" data-end_ts="1009.2" title="1008.8" id=c_"1008.8">__courses__</span>, courses 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Well, and, and certainly, the last time that you visited me, you left the, CD with me that I have gotten an opportunity to listen to a number of times. And that's, I would say that's sort of the structure of that, which is A, B, C, D, E, F G <laugh> on through the alphabet. It was, it was something else. It was a stunning, so since you kind of started off, the bands that you were in, even when you were young, were taking on really aggressive and really sort of difficult music. Has there ever been a time when you've just done simple fun music? Or has, or does that just not speak to you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>I actually do that a lot because I also, I still make, jingles for TV commercials that I make here in my studio. So that's pretty straightforward. Sure. Happy simple stuff that, is useful for selling things to people. I do like simple things also, like with pop songs, it's always, nice to hear. And even some punk rock band that are like some attitude and, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1082.14" data-end_ts="1082.36" title="1082.14" id=c_"1082.14">__pro__</span> power and just some hook. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. I, you know, I didn't mean that. I hope it didn't sound like I was criticizing you about like, being difficult or whatever. It's just when I think of your music and the, the different variations that I've heard it, I always think of you as being sort of, almost enveloped by complexity. And I think, you know, it's, it's interesting 'cause one of the things I didn't realize, but you mentioned it very quickly when you were talking about your background, is you actually went to school for astronomy, right? Yeah. So, what's, first of all, why astronomy? I have to ask, I'm just curious. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>Basically just to get away from my <span style="color:red" data-ts="1125.4" data-end_ts="1125.68" title="1125.4" id=c_"1125.4">__hometown__</span>, <laugh> <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>I, I, I needed to a place in the hel <span style="color:red" data-ts="1131.68" data-end_ts="1131.84" title="1131.68" id=c_"1131.68">__center__</span> University and, apply to different departments and, department of, physical sciences accepted me and, the main subject, I chose Astronom because it's interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Well, and it's, so you just, you applied with everybody and you took whoever would take you, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>Yeah. <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. That's funny. That's great. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>Again, as in, in you want, going to education is basically free, so you can go to university and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1164.51" data-end_ts="1164.8" title="1164.51" id=c_"1164.51">__Yeah__</span>. It doesn't cost a lot. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, I see. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>So you just need a bank loan or whatever just to stay alive, but <span style="color:red" data-ts="1172.74" data-end_ts="1172.96" title="1172.74" id=c_"1172.74">__now__</span> you don't have to pay for the education, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>For the schooling costs. Right. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1176.92" data-end_ts="1177.04" title="1176.92" id=c_"1176.92">__It__</span>, it, so it wasn't, well, it was a easy decision. I just wanted to get some education, whatever that was, and, see where I can go. And I wanted to come to Helsinki <span style="color:red" data-ts="1188.64" data-end_ts="1188.84" title="1188.64" id=c_"1188.64">__for__</span> Helsinki University. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. I mean, did you specifically choose not to study music, or was it just not really an option? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>I didn't have the formal pre-education that, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1200.43" data-end_ts="1200.72" title="1200.43" id=c_"1200.43">__that__</span> have been necessarily because, there's, at least at that time, there was just one university grade, school where you could go that was <span style="color:red" data-ts="1212.68" data-end_ts="1212.8" title="1212.68" id=c_"1212.68">__a__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1212.96" data-end_ts="1213.16" title="1212.96" id=c_"1212.96">__<inaudible>__</span> Academy, and that place is really hard to get to. Right. You have to start playing before you were <span style="color:red" data-ts="1221.35" data-end_ts="1221.64" title="1221.35" id=c_"1221.35">__born__</span> or something. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I think it's, it's actually interesting because again, you and I are roughly the same age. Yeah. And, what's interesting to me, and, and what you just said, I hadn't really thought about, but is really true when we are coming up being really good at pop music or rock music, even Prague rock music mm-hmm. Just was not considered, useful from an educational or an academic standpoint at all. It was, you might as well have never played music because from their perspective, you sort of haven't. Now in universities there are a lot of different ways to approach music, or you can go to university and study music production and recording. Back in our day, there was no such thing at all. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>No, no. There wasn't nowadays, so much better. They have <span style="color:red" data-ts="1271.44" data-end_ts="1271.56" title="1271.44" id=c_"1271.44">__a__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1272.16" data-end_ts="1272.32" title="1272.16" id=c_"1272.16">__<inaudible>__</span> Academy, they have a Department of music technology mm-hmm. <affirmative>, for example, that has produced many <span style="color:red" data-ts="1278.51" data-end_ts="1278.8" title="1278.51" id=c_"1278.51">__made__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1280.23" data-end_ts="1280.52" title="1280.23" id=c_"1280.23">__yeah__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1281.04" data-end_ts="1281.16" title="1281.04" id=c_"1281.04">__I__</span> know. And, but it, it was in the seventies and eighties, it was a different world. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It was much different. Well, I know that for myself, an awful lot of my learning about recording came two ways. First of all, I had a task cam <span style="color:red" data-ts="1297.85" data-end_ts="1298.2" title="1297.85" id=c_"1297.85">__eight__</span> channel reel-to-reel recorder, and I tried using it on everything. I tried making all kinds of crazy recordings and I read everything I could about it. So that was a big, a big part of learning was experimenting. Right. Yeah. The other thing is I got to know a couple of people who were really good recording people, and they came, kind of gave me hints along the way. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. So that was how I got all of my background. And, and then it was just a matter of recording and recording and recording. That's how I learned recording technique. What was, what was your path? How did you get to the point where you became not only comfortable, but pretty good, pretty savvy at, at the recording process? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>Recording, I think I started learning, stuff pretty much like you. In the very early eighties after I, I graduated from school before I went to the university, because we had this synth gear and also sequencer, I found that I could start making also electronic music by my own in addition to playing in the band mm-hmm. <affirmative>. So I went to our rehearsal space and, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1372.14" data-end_ts="1372.36" title="1372.14" id=c_"1372.14">__to__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1372.36" data-end_ts="1372.48" title="1372.36" id=c_"1372.36">__have__</span> a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1372.6" data-end_ts="1372.84" title="1372.6" id=c_"1372.6">__poem__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1373.26" data-end_ts="1373.48" title="1373.26" id=c_"1373.26">__in__</span> the gear and started experimenting. And with that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1376.59" data-end_ts="1376.88" title="1376.59" id=c_"1376.59">__they__</span> can, need to get that recorded. So I bought a two track reel <span style="color:red" data-ts="1381.84" data-end_ts="1382.12" title="1381.84" id=c_"1381.84">__tour__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1382.12" data-end_ts="1382.32" title="1382.12" id=c_"1382.12">__real__</span>, recorder and started learning how to get sound into it and, what, what else I could do with it. And also used some ca recordings. And so making, solo electronic music and recording came pretty much at the same time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. To what, what did you do with your recordings? Did you, were you part of like the cassette trading people mm-hmm. <affirmative>? Or did you just stack them up? I mean, for me, I never traded 'em. I made lots of recordings and I put 'em in a stack in the corner, because for me it was almost, it was more interesting doing the recording than trading the music that I recorded. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>I did, I probably used some cassette albums. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>Three or four in the early eighties. And one of them I got, I sort of got signed by a very small cassette company who released it. And it actually did sell maybe a couple hundred copies. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1443.82" data-end_ts="1444.04" title="1443.82" id=c_"1443.82">__Oh__</span>, that's cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>And then in the mid eighties when we had the next band here in Helsinki, we went to many, well actually it'll be all, all the record companies in Helsinki to try and get, signed to a label. And one of them took us, I mean, the band <span style="color:red" data-ts="1462.03" data-end_ts="1462.32" title="1462.03" id=c_"1462.03">__that__</span> we had, but I <laugh> I had included my solo stuff <span style="color:red" data-ts="1466.3" data-end_ts="1466.52" title="1466.3" id=c_"1466.3">__on__</span> the b side of the cassette I gave to the, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1468.99" data-end_ts="1469.28" title="1468.99" id=c_"1468.99">__they__</span> called company execute to him. And he had listened to that and said, next time we met, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1475.9" data-end_ts="1476.12" title="1475.9" id=c_"1475.9">__but__</span> hey, this sounds pretty cool. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1478.3" data-end_ts="1478.52" title="1478.3" id=c_"1478.3">__We__</span> could release this as your solo album. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. So they put that out and, after that they went bankrupt. So they didn't get to release the band album because, but my solo album was, already finished. Right. And I just gave them the master and they released. So I, I did get some publicity from that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, how did you go from, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1502.74" data-end_ts="1502.96" title="1502.74" id=c_"1502.74">__and__</span>, and I think a lot of people will be curious, how do you go from, you know, playing in bands and producing some solo material and being fascinated with recording and stuff? How do you go from that into creating a company that does, does music for hire? I mean, that's a, that seems like a pretty big jump. How did you get from being banned and recording guy to being professional composer? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>I guess it's a matter of meeting the right people at the right time. And when I came to Helsinki and started well, <inaudible> and started meeting people and getting to know new people, I was introduced to some, some people who had some contacts. And I think I was pretty active to shopping for different possibilities I could go to and going to work in the video company also helped. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>Sure. Of course. 'cause they, they had some need for soundtrack stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So when, when is it that you started working with the video company? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>87. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. So back then there was a lot of technology involved in trying to do synchronizing, you know, trying to compose to film or compose to video. 'cause you had to have a sync locked video player and all that kind of stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1587.35" data-end_ts="1587.64" title="1587.35" id=c_"1587.35">__Yeah__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's, it's not like now where you can kind of have a window on your laptop that's playing Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b><laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>Yeah. It was quite a lot equip involved and really hard to do. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It was, it was tedious work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>We basically had a v h s player where we could record one track on one one of the audio tracks. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, record a time code and then use the Synchronizer box to syn into that and syn the sequencing computer. At that time, it was a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1623.62" data-end_ts="1623.84" title="1623.62" id=c_"1623.62">__RO__</span> 64 very basic <span style="color:red" data-ts="1626.66" data-end_ts="1626.88" title="1626.66" id=c_"1626.66">__VD__</span> sequencer. Okay. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="1628.94" data-end_ts="1629.16" title="1628.94" id=c_"1628.94">__the__</span> tape recorder also had to be synced. Right. Right. So it was, it was quite complicated. And there were all kinds of technical hassles, you know. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. How do you think that your approach to doing composition work or whatever is kind of framed by the fact that when you started doing it, it wasn't easy? So, you know, when you started working with synthesizers, there wasn't much for sequencers. And then when you first got into it, they were like little hardware sequencers where you had to plug in all the parameters for a note, one at a time on a numeric keypad or something. I don't know. The c you said the CSQ 100 was your first sequencer? Yep. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>Yep. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Was that one where you typed in the commands, or did you have to play them in? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>You have to play them in oth <span style="color:red" data-ts="1679.4" data-end_ts="1679.64" title="1679.4" id=c_"1679.4">__other__</span>, in real time or step by step. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see. Okay. But, you know, still it was quite limited, then. Yeah, very. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>And 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Then, yeah. And then even, even when you started working with this video company, you <span style="color:red" data-ts="1692.6" data-end_ts="1692.68" title="1692.6" id=c_"1692.6">__are__</span> working with Commodore 60 fours at the time, that put limits on what you could do with a composition. Right. You could only do so much. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1701.71" data-end_ts="1702" title="1701.71" id=c_"1701.71">__Yeah__</span>. How do you think that that affects the way that you do composition today? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1707.58" data-end_ts="1707.8" title="1707.58" id=c_"1707.58">__Oh__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1707.82" data-end_ts="1708.04" title="1707.82" id=c_"1707.82">__in__</span> not much. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Really? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>I'm actually sort of in some kind of heaven <laugh>, because <laugh>, it's so, so easy compared to those days I was at. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1721.26" data-end_ts="1721.48" title="1721.26" id=c_"1721.26">__And__</span> the thing is, when, at those times it computer started acting, as a sequencer and later recording audio, it was so obvious way it's going to go. But at the same time, when you work on it, on a daily basis, it was so slow. <laugh> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1741.66" data-end_ts="1742.08" title="1741.66" id=c_"1741.66">__waited__</span>, that waited, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1743.07" data-end_ts="1743.36" title="1743.07" id=c_"1743.07">__what__</span>? Can't we, we just jump to the, what you call conclusion. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Yeah. Well, that's, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>That, that's where we are now, have been for several years now. And, this is kind of what I always hoped I would get, as quickly as possible. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Well, that's, that's interesting you say it that way because I run, where I run into that situation is people I talk to who love tape recorders mm-hmm. <affirmative>, you know, they talk to me about the, how they love the sound of tape, and they love the, the kind of effect that it has on recorded music. And when I think back to the days of tape recorders, all I can think of is the amount of time wasted while I waited for the tape recorder to rewind over and over again. Right. Yeah. And so, where a lot of people are nostalgic for the old days, I'm not very nostalgic about it at all. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>I'm not, yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1805.53" data-end_ts="1805.88" title="1805.53" id=c_"1805.53">__Sorry__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And so now, now my question is, one of the places where I still am a little nostalgic is for old synthesizers. I don't really have any old synthesizers, actually. I have things that now are styled, like old synthesizers. Mm-hmm. So I have a Euro rack and I have a five <span style="color:red" data-ts="1825.04" data-end_ts="1825.32" title="1825.04" id=c_"1825.04">__view__</span>, modular system, you know, and both of those things have kind of honor the technology of the late seventies, but are clearly modern. Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1835.82" data-end_ts="1836.04" title="1835.82" id=c_"1835.82">__Yep__</span>. How much do you still dabble in old synthesizers? Do you play much with new ones? 
</p>

<p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>Cool. Although the keyboard is not nice at all, but <laugh>, it's, it's good for testing sounds 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Not 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>For playing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Last time we talked, you said that you had actually gotten rid of most of your hardware and you're doing almost everything in software now, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>Yeah, I do have some hardware since I bought <span style="color:red" data-ts="1903.52" data-end_ts="1903.64" title="1903.52" id=c_"1903.52">__a__</span> studio Logic Sledge last summer, I quite a lot. It laid out like a traditional software, but it has some Waldorf waveforms. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1915.72" data-end_ts="1916.2" title="1915.72" id=c_"1915.72">__Popular__</span>. And it's got huge knobs, <laugh> that are, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1920.78" data-end_ts="1921" title="1920.78" id=c_"1920.78">__are__</span> very visible if you play a gig. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>Of course. I have some guitars and lick bass. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, you still play guitar a little? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1930.66" data-end_ts="1930.88" title="1930.66" id=c_"1930.66">__Yep__</span>, I do occasionally, mm-hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative>. And what do you do for percussion? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>I have, set of, raw <span style="color:red" data-ts="1937.64" data-end_ts="1937.84" title="1937.64" id=c_"1937.64">__and__</span> v drums, TD 20 x. Okay. Some module and electronic drum kit. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Are you a pretty good drummer or is it something that you use just to get 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>Ideas? I'm, I'm really <laugh> drummer and, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1955.3" data-end_ts="1955.52" title="1955.3" id=c_"1955.3">__and__</span> sloppy too. Right. So I, I, I think what I often do is, if I'm doing pieces that require good drumming and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1966.08" data-end_ts="1966.6" title="1966.08" id=c_"1966.08">__authentic__</span>, authentic sound sounding drumming is that I play what I hear that drummer should play mm-hmm. <affirmative> on the electronic kit and then send it to a drummer who does it for real. Right. He plays it like a drummer would play it Right. On an acoustic drum. Sure. So that's, when I really want to have the best possible, drum or some pieces, then some stuff just, it's not essential to have a, a good stylish calming just 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Sometimes it needs to keep time. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>So that's, that's when I often always resort to playing some percussion sound on the keyword. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>So that's the quickest way of getting some customer Sure. Things going on. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So now you, when you came up through the industry as very different time from now, but I'm sure that you, you see people trying to make careers in music, today, what would be your suggestion to people that are trying to get into it now? I mean, because to a certain extent, you, you took a lot of different approaches. You played in bands, but you also worked on solo material, . <affirmative>, you got to know a lot of people. You did a lot of different kinds of work. You surrounded yourself in gear a lot, and I think all of those things led to you becoming the person that you are now, but it's a different time. If somebody was starting off now, what would you tell, what would you suggest that they do? Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>That's an interesting question because, at times are certainly more difficult for people coming to <span style="color:red" data-ts="2077.72" data-end_ts="2077.84" title="2077.72" id=c_"2077.72">__a__</span> business or <span style="color:red" data-ts="2078.86" data-end_ts="2079.08" title="2078.86" id=c_"2078.86">__any__</span> business maybe, to get some real, real work that pays their bills. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>So, my suggestion would be that try, many different things and find the ones that, you think are, are most suited to and most interesting. So you, you can, happily spend hours and hours getting to know that stuff. So at the same time, be diverse and specific when, when you find something in the diversity that you think you can, you could concentrate on that one thing very closely. So you, you might be able to become an expert in that particular thing, but still, know a lot of stuff somewhere else or around that expertise. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that's really good advice. I think it's, I think it's actually interesting that you say to be both specific and diverse, because it seems like that's hard for people to do. It's hard for people to embrace or be able to do everything, but, but really be focused on one thing. And I think if I look at your career, you seem to be able to do happy music for jingles and corporate music for, corporate shows, but you still have this very particular voice that, you know, sometimes expresses itself in the ozone player stuff, sometimes in other work. And so I think you're, you provide a good model for how that could be done. Now my question is what, how, now that you're actually doing it, so you have a career making, you know, music for corporate work and doing jingles and doing soundtracks. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>How do you maintain the passion for still doing your own music? And I ask this because it's, it's a conflict. I sometimes have, you know mm-hmm. <affirmative>, I work in the soft music software industry rather than doing corporate audio work. But there's still kind of this thing that says, well, I'm working with this stuff all day long, and so when I go home, it's kind of hard to get excited about working on it some more. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, how do you maintain an excitement for doing your own work when creating music is your job as well? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>Yeah, that's a good question. And, and sometimes I can't maintain, that, I can spend a year just doing work stuff and not interested in doing anything on top of that. But, if that other thing is different enough from the normal stuff, like my <span style="color:red" data-ts="2246.11" data-end_ts="2246.4" title="2246.11" id=c_"2246.11">__zone__</span> player music mm-hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>It, it's a bit like a different world. And, it also needs some, special circumstances, not too much paying work at the same time, but usually months, like February, March, or quite slow in my business mm-hmm. <affirmative>, those are, and the weather is horrible here, <laugh> at the same time. So if you don't want to go out, out either, because it's, it's, cold and rainy and windy. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>So that's a good time to jump in and, try to find some, something new and exciting. Just playing sounds and trying different chords and chord progressions. And then usually, the first things I come up with are not exciting at all. It's just like warming up mm-hmm. <affirmative>. But if I keep, keep doing it for a couple of days, I usually stumble into something really interesting and that that's where I start, getting actually excited and inspired. So it, it's, it's not easy, but it's, very rewarding if you find that, excitement. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>So, and in general, I'd say that, good practice to try, try to stay away from simple and obvious things because, those things are, they have already been done. So to create something exciting and you, you probably have to work a lot to find it. And, it can appear to pop out of nowhere very easily. But, hidden inside that is a lot of time spent experimenting and, you know, subconscious has been working on it and stuff. You have to be some, like <span style="color:red" data-ts="2366" data-end_ts="2366.12" title="2366" id=c_"2366">__a__</span> pretty stubbornly just do it long enough so that at one time, maybe, maybe a dedicated week <span style="color:red" data-ts="2373.38" data-end_ts="2373.6" title="2373.38" id=c_"2373.38">__for__</span> trying to come, come up with one good idea that you are inspired by and that gets you going right direction. So don't queue up, give up if, things So like go or you, you're not inspired making music. That would be my advice to everybody who <span style="color:red" data-ts="2394.4" data-end_ts="2394.48" title="2394.4" id=c_"2394.4">__would__</span> try to. Yeah. Well 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's, that's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>Interesting. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2396.36" data-end_ts="2396.48" title="2396.36" id=c_"2396.36">__Make__</span>, make a living in, in, in music and also want to, you'll be inspired by 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It. Right. That's an interesting approach because, first of all, it's cool that you kind of gave us a metric, the idea of saying, you know, work for a week on trying to come up with something that's difficult because two things are gonna happen. First of all, if you are going to dedicate a week to coming up with an idea, it means you're probably not gonna be satisfied with the simplest thing you come up with or the first thing you come up with. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. But also by spending a week on an idea, you're gonna have no choice but for it to have your own voice instead of being an emulation of anyone else's thing, it's gonna be <span style="color:red" data-ts="2444.32" data-end_ts="2444.52" title="2444.32" id=c_"2444.32">__you__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2445.3" data-end_ts="2445.52" title="2445.3" id=c_"2445.3">__be__</span>. That's really, that's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2446.72" data-end_ts="2446.76" title="2446.72" id=c_"2446.72">__a__</span> interesting approach. That's cool. Well, thank you. Thanks for that. That's, that, that's got my head tweaked. I, I feel like I need to go into woodshed just because of that. <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b><laugh> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2459.3" data-end_ts="2459.52" title="2459.3" id=c_"2459.3">__all__</span> great. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So, I thank you for that. Our time is already up. I, I appreciate the time you've been willing to spend with me. This has been a, a very interesting and revealing conversation. One last thing. It's been a while since the last Ozone Player release. When's the next thing gonna come out? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>Hopefully next year. Actually, actually working on the next three years. And it's like half, half finished this point, but I'm still, I still need, let's say three or four new good ideas. So that's probably three or four weeks, three 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Or four weeks of work That's right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>For finding them 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Well, that's, make sure you let me know when that's solid. I'm, I'll be looking forward to it. In the, in the meantime, for listeners, if you want to, check in on it, you can, look on ozone player.com. There's information about, about where you, what the releases, his releases are available, as well as where you can get 'em Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>Available in most digital, places. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, thank you so much, Zo, for spending the time. It was a great talk. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>Yeah, thank you. It was really great talking to you. Alright, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Have a good day. You too. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Otso: </b>Bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And there you have it, TSO in a bag, <laugh>, so to speak. Thanks so much to everyone for listening. Thanks a lot to Zo for taking the time out on, literally Thanksgiving day my time. Now he's in Helsinki, so I don't think they give a crap about Thanksgiving, but, my family sure did and they were actually quite cool about me spending the time talking to Zo. And anytime I get an hour with him, it's a great hour for me. So I hope you enjoyed this. Thanks a lot for listening. Remember to share the podcast with your friends, family, and even enemies 'cause they sometimes need creativity too. Otherwise, I'll talk to you next week.
