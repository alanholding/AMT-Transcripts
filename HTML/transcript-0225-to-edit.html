<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, today I have the great pleasure of getting to speak to somebody who is a little bit of, of a legend in my mind. He came up when we had the discussion with Dr. <span style="color:red" data-ts="24.315" data-end_ts="24.805" title="24.315" id=c_"24.315">__Liberal__</span> Hawkin about the Hawkin Continuum. His name is Edmund Egan, and he is the person that everyone points to as, Hawkin master. And, he is kind of a combination of artist, composer, inventor, hacker. This is gonna be a fabulous, interview. So, with that, I'm gonna say hello to Edmund GaN. Hey, man. Hello. How's it going? <laugh>? Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Edmund Eagan: </b>Very good, very good. Darwin, how are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm great. Thank you so much for taking, I look at the things that you do, and I just think that your schedule must be crazy with all the stuff that you have to do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Edmund: </b>Yeah. It's, I'm never bored. <laugh>, lemme put, I don't, I don't understand that concept. I always, have work to do. I always have a backlog of things. I always have a dream list of things, and then when I'm relaxing, I'm, I'm just daydreaming and, mulling things over in my head. So I try to work it in. I mean, everybody, you know, time is the most valuable commodity for sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Indeed, indeed it is. So, where you have been coming up a lot in both my run-ins with people as well as in my interview with Dr. Hawken, was, you were involved in the development of the sound engine that the Continuum uses. It's the, the Egan Matrix that correct? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Edmund: </b>That's correct. Yeah. So that started back when I first bought a continuum, and unbeknownst to me when I bought it, I was actually the second person to buy one. So <laugh>, I sort of saw it as this established finished instrument. And, you were 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Actually the Guinea pig. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Edmund: </b>I was the Guinea pig, yeah. And, I saw it because, Lippold had a close relationship with symbolic sound who developed <span style="color:red" data-ts="141.885" data-end_ts="142.165" title="141.885" id=c_"141.885">__chemo__</span>. Right. And when he developed the fingerboard, there was some intimate hooks that were put in place with <span style="color:red" data-ts="148.635" data-end_ts="148.925" title="148.635" id=c_"148.635">__Kima__</span> so that the fingerboard would, continuing fingerboard would, would communicate very intimately with the, Kea Sound engine. And at that point, the continuum did not have a dedicated DSP, it, it just had this interface card that connected with <span style="color:red" data-ts="164.745" data-end_ts="164.965" title="164.745" id=c_"164.745">__Ke__</span>. And Kim's a really big and fascinating, DSP environment, dedicated DSP environment and, and, graphical language. I was involved with KEA for quite some time, developing tools for it. And I went down to Champaign, Illinois, where coincidentally both symbolic sound and Hawk <span style="color:red" data-ts="189.285" data-end_ts="189.365" title="189.285" id=c_"189.285">__and__</span> Audio are in the same town where the University of Illinois is. And I went to an immersion weekend there, for Kea, this is prior to the Continuum, and I got introduced to Lippold and Carla from, symbolic Sound. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Edmund: </b>She had a, continuum. And I tried it and first touch, I thought, oh, geez, this is, I've never ever played anything like this, you know? So, it was just, I, I thought, and it was one of those things where I tried it and I said, you know, this is so beautiful and interesting, and, and it worked really well with <span style="color:red" data-ts="226.115" data-end_ts="226.405" title="226.115" id=c_"226.115">__Kima__</span> at the time then, and, you know, amazing, amazing integration that you didn't, that also astounded me, like just the way that you could work with it. But then I sort of put it in the back of my head, mainly financially. I mean, it was, you know, an expense, relatively big expense to, to buy a continuum. But then, like six months later, I contacted Lip <span style="color:red" data-ts="249.365" data-end_ts="249.565" title="249.365" id=c_"249.365">__Hold__</span> and decided my cash flow was good enough, and I decided to buy one and tried it out. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Edmund: </b>And, you know, it's like one of those things, you've probably noticed this with new things that you get, you, you go for this initial period of, excitement and exploration. And it's kind of like me, if I take out a gym membership, I, I'm good about three months <laugh> where, you know, you just, there's so much dedication. You're doing things and then you have improvement, and then you hit this wall. And so the wall happened with me, and I, frankly, I dropped it, you know, so that's, there's, it's kind of a litmus test for me with, I've experimented with a lot of different instruments and I, I give them a chance. I see. I'm careful before I buy, so I, you know, I try to be an intelligent purchaser, but then sometimes it just, you, what you thought was a conception, you know, you, it was a misconception. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Edmund: </b>So I said, okay, well, I don't know if I can work with this. And I let it sit. And then it sat for about three, four months, and I rarely played it. And then something got into me, I got back into it, and I decided, well, there's a lot of potential here, but there's a lot of things that need, I think, need to be improved. 'cause the continuum has gone through a lot of revisions. Nothing major, but just all these little things, the little things that make an average instrument, and just to an exceptional instrument. And I, I con contacted Lippold and, he <span style="color:red" data-ts="337.525" data-end_ts="337.685" title="337.525" id=c_"337.525">__was__</span> very, you know, friendly and engaging. And, I had some suggestions. And to my great surprise, he was really open to them, <laugh>. I looked at it and say, wow, this is pretty cool. Like, this guy is willing to really listen to me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Edmund: </b>And what we discovered over our early relationship, and now we, we've been friends for such a long time, but we have this real complimentary, feature set that we, you know, I have this ear. I can do sound design. I'm a musician. I know code in a certain way. And he's an exceptional programmer. But also he's <span style="color:red" data-ts="374.005" data-end_ts="374.205" title="374.005" id=c_"374.005">__also__</span> a, an exceptional hardware specialist, which is really, they're few and far between. So he solves problems electronically and mechanically at the same. And they, and the continuum is very much that it needs that synthesis of, the mechanical part and the, DSP part <span style="color:red" data-ts="391.705" data-end_ts="391.925" title="391.705" id=c_"391.705">__in__</span> integration with a design that brings out the musicality within the instrument. That relationship has been going on for, for years, ever since 2001, 2002. We've gone through lots of tinkering, thinking about the instrument. There's a lot of heart and sweat and soul in this thing. And, and I always looked at it over the years. I mean, it's not a money maker, you know, this, it's a real small subset of people within the musicians world that <span style="color:red" data-ts="419.605" data-end_ts="419.725" title="419.605" id=c_"419.605">__were__</span>, that are interested in this. But, I've looked at it, is that I've had the ability to work on something very exceptional, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="428.765" data-end_ts="428.925" title="428.765" id=c_"428.765">__they__</span> have one of the top DSP programmers in the world at my fingertips, listening to my ideas. So I feel very blessed about that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, that's some, that's some pretty heady stuff. And you are right, Dr. Hawkin is, is amazing. When I interviewed him and he started talking about like, the ways that he tried different kinds of materials to get just the right feel or different kinds of, mechanical combinations in order to get the right responsiveness, it, I would say that not only is he a talented, not only is he a talented hardware and coder, hardware designer and coder, he's also a little bit of an obsessive compulsive <laugh>, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Edmund: </b>And Oh yeah, absolutely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You know, he, and I wonder how hard it was for you to, to influence him, because my assumption would be that he would be very rigorous about any kind of feedback that he got. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Edmund: </b>It's been over, you know, years, him trusting my, input. So it, it's been getting, it's gets easier and easier as time goes on. You know, it's like any relationship, you learn how to communicate, right? Like, he has a very particular way of, going through a thought process. He has some interesting quirks too. He has total lack of face recognition. And it, and it makes for an interesting mind flow for him. 'cause he has to, he's got some of the most heavily <span style="color:red" data-ts="520.025" data-end_ts="520.245" title="520.025" id=c_"520.025">__do__</span>, commented code you're ever gonna see because he has to do it even for him to get back into it. Whenever I discuss something new, I know it's coming out of left field for him. So you <span style="color:red" data-ts="530.925" data-end_ts="531.085" title="530.925" id=c_"530.925">__all__</span>, you almost have to wait and let him come around to your idea. So I just learned to present those things, let him figure out the flow of it, and then come back in. So it's just understanding the, you know, the, how the relationship can work. And he is very open. He, he knows that I want this thing to be the best. And he knows we have that same dedication to that to it. So that, you know, opens the door for me. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and also, I'm sure that your background adds to his ability to trust what you're saying. I mean, people can look at, 12th root.com, which is, a site that's, that starts to talk a little bit about the many things you've done. You have quite a history of, composition and sound design work. Can you talk a little bit about, about that and how you got into it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Edmund: </b>Let's see, what, I was in a exceptionally great high school. I was really fortunate. And, you know, it usually comes down to one teacher. And I can point to my, the orchestral director, in my high school, Steve McNeil, which, I went to high school in Fort Collins, Colorado. And, you know, this was just one of those guys that, so positive, so interesting, and, influenced my life. And, and at that point, I knew I loved mathematics and I loved, music, but I didn't know which direction I was gonna go into. And having someone like Steve McNeil in my life, made me think, oh, this is really, there's a lot of magic here and there's a lot of, there's a lot of joy and I, I should pursue this. And so, when my family moved to Canada, we're Canadian originally, but we lived around in Alaska, in Colorado as my dad worked. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Edmund: </b>And, and we finally settled in Ottawa. I went to university, in, in Ottawa called Carleton, which again, I just lucked into this. It had <span style="color:red" data-ts="644.165" data-end_ts="644.285" title="644.165" id=c_"644.165">__a__</span> intimate music department. They had invested in a, this would've been in the, late seventies and then early eighties. We had a Cynthia 100 and I got exposed to electronic music in a really great way. And it was a very nice program. I had two composition teachers there, David Piper and Patrick <span style="color:red" data-ts="667.855" data-end_ts="668.205" title="667.855" id=c_"667.855">__Cardy__</span>, who, were really big influences on me. And, but what happened in school and, and, and actually I'm, I'm gonna be teaching at Carlton again. I've never taught a course before, but I'm gonna be in a, a winter <span style="color:red" data-ts="681.065" data-end_ts="681.285" title="681.065" id=c_"681.065">__se__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="681.385" data-end_ts="681.605" title="681.385" id=c_"681.385">__or__</span> a fall session with them teaching, film composition. My idea is to teach a course that, is the kind of course that I, I desperately wanted when I was in, in university, but, but I couldn't get, I couldn't get this practicality. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Edmund: </b>I couldn't get a course that was practical in nature. And the theories, and the structures behind all that were applied to that practicality in the schools that I, as much as I loved it, everything you were being taught by people that were teachers and never got out of the institution. So I had no idea how the heck I was gonna make a living, you know, doing what I wanted to do, do. I knew I wanted to do something in music. And then when I got outta school, I worked in a music store, which was, you know, I could make a living. And it was great 'cause I was exposed to a lot of instruments there. You, like, at that point, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="737.665" data-end_ts="737.885" title="737.665" id=c_"737.665">__IMU__</span> emulators were, were coming out, right. CS 80 d, all this, that sort of vintage of, of instruments had very fun time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Edmund: </b>Oh, fun. Yeah, fun time. And, and so I had access to a lot of, so I was learning on the job, and what I did was, I, I just applied myself to join a video co-op, and decided to integrate into the artistic community in town. And I met a video director there that <span style="color:red" data-ts="766.245" data-end_ts="766.445" title="766.245" id=c_"766.245">__works__</span>, that we've been working together since the early eighties. He developed into the video directing and cinematography world, and I developed into the, sound design and music for, for Visual World. And it just was a, so my work sort of came out from, you know, being, getting surrounded by people that were learning complimentary arts. And through those compliment arts, we could help each other. And so we had collectives and I did scores like for low money for free for a dance company. But at, at this dance company, one of the students was another, radio and video producer. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Edmund: </b>And so it's just a whole series of connections that came and Ottawa's a relatively small town, so I learned to be a jack of all trades. You know, I could do voice records, I can do edits. And I, I learned about sound design and, and man, oh man, my, orchestration class and the sensitivity to picking apart a sound field, whether it's musical or sound effect, or like listening to a movie and knowing what those, the constructs were, those are so useful. And, and having that ear to be able to apply. And so that, that musical information, even though it was very theoretical, it ended up by figured out on my own how to do that practicality. And, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. Interesting. Yeah. Have you been in Ottawa the whole time? Did you develop your whole career from out of Ottawa? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Edmund: </b>Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>How big of a city is that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Edmund: </b>The greater Ottawa area is maybe, you know, 1000001.6, maybe 1.7. Okay. It's small, but it's the capital. So it's a government town. So I had a lot of, okay, sure. Government contracts we're not very far. We're sort of situated two hours from Montreal and four and a half hours from Toronto. Okay. So there's quite vibrant, production communities in both of those towns, Uhhuh, <affirmative>. So I was able to, get employed with that. And also through working through our, public, broadcasting system, CBC, I got a lot of jobs working on, on in with them. And the nice thing about that, that's a national network, and at one point I was thinking, well, maybe I should leave Ottawa, you know, it's like I'm getting to be, you know, the pond is small here, but <laugh>, but, you know, you jump to another pond. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Edmund: </b>And then I, <span style="color:red" data-ts="905.365" data-end_ts="905.525" title="905.365" id=c_"905.365">__so__</span> this was would've been when I was in my late thirties, I was thinking about this and I said, okay, well, let's, so I, I started to make this affiliation with this company in Toronto. It's as we talked through things, and it was a slow kind of marriage of how we we're gonna get together and thinking about it. And I just realized at one point, okay, standard of living Toronto <span style="color:red" data-ts="927.805" data-end_ts="928.005" title="927.805" id=c_"927.805">__was__</span> more expensive to live in than Ottawa. I realized how valuable it was that network that I had built up. And then I was realizing that I say, okay, I can't do this move. I, what I should have done is that I should have decided early on, you know, before I got, had kids and be, before I was committed to other financial responsibilities, I should have jumped and gone to, if I really wanted to do this, go to LA or go to New York, or go go to some large center and apply that way, because I would jump into Toronto and I would just be another fish in that, you know, slightly larger pond. So, right. I, <span style="color:red" data-ts="969.045" data-end_ts="969.165" title="969.045" id=c_"969.045">__I__</span>, I had an established thing here, and, and then I realized, and this was actually realizing that before, that was well before we had such a amazing network of, electrons that connect us all. So, as that has grown, it's become less and less important to, to, to be in physically in this sense, physically 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Be in there. Yeah. Right. I actually think that you hit on something though, that there's a lot to be gained by being in a big city, but there's also a lot to be gained in a smaller city where there is especially one that has some vitality to it, and especially one where everybody has to, almost, almost is forced to be sort of cross-disciplinary. Right. I mean, some of, some of the most enjoyable things for me have been when I've been drawn into working with dance companies or working on, audio for video or audio for film or whatever, because I was like the only guy around at the time. And you get drawn into things that you otherwise might not have an opportunity to just because you happen to be there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Edmund: </b>Yeah. You learn things, you know, even if you think that this is gonna be a very mundane task, you learn things. And also there's those skills. It's like, I, I enjoy dialogue editing, right? Like, you know, it's a very straightforward thing. And I love, I just love the, the nature of it. And it's almost like this, it's almost like you're, you know, raking the leaves where, you know, you're doing something that's relatively simple to do. Your mind can wander as you go around those things. So I find for me, like I am most productive in the morning, so I tend to schedule a day around tasks where the most intense ones are from, from about 10 30 to two 30. And then I leave the sort of administration things, either bookkeeping or simpler audio tasks too, for the evening when I can just daydream 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Yeah. That's, that's actually really smart. I sometimes, I sometimes forget that you can get pretty drug out by the end of the day, and then all of a sudden, if you have to do creative sound design, you just not, might not be in the right spot for that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Edmund: </b>Exactly. And your ears will be tired too, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Indeed. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Edmund: </b>Yeah. As much as I try to protect them, and I mean, that's really critical. I played in a band when I was, we were kind of a progressive band, but at the time that I had joined about a year later was, it was going less from the genesis, king Crimson loves that I had into the more, heavy metal end of things. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1128.105" data-end_ts="1128.325" title="1128.105" id=c_"1128.105">__Oh__</span>, okay. And I sort of fell up with that, but I always wore hearing protection, so Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That's one of the things, even, even as a young, even as a early teenager, I knew I was gonna want to be doing sound stuff. So when I'd go with my friends to ridiculous concerts, I would be the only one in the whole place with like, my ears stuffed with foam. They all thought I was crazy. But I don't know, I, I still, I maintain like pretty, pretty good hearing for my age, so that, that comes excellent through some, that comes through some effort. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Edmund: </b>So, so the conversation goes, you're, you'll see your friends and you'll go, you'll say, Hey, remember when I wore hearing protection? And they say, what <laugh> remember when I wore hearing <laugh>? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? Indeed. What, what is your primary instrument? Are you primarily a keyboardist? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Edmund: </b>Yeah. So, when I was in high school, I played oboe and piano. Okay. And, then through university I played oboe, but I dropped it after, as I played piano that naturally led into, 'cause I was into electronics too, getting into, synthesizers. Yeah. That sort of thing. And the oboe was an excellent instrument to, be exposed to because it, it brought a musicality to me that is the singing, you know, expressive monophonic line. So I, I think it's really imperative that anyone who plays like any sort of, you know, more polyphonic instrument, like a guitar or a, especially a, a piano that you, you do like sing or you play in a monophonic instrument that leads you into those, the beauty of the melisma of the world, rather than the harmonic structures. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. Well, and it's interesting, I saw, I saw an amazing video of you performing at, I think it was the, the 2016 Super booth. You did a, a demo of the Continuum and the Eagan Matrix. And it was incredible to me because you had, you were using the, the Eagan Matrix and it had some very, you know, what, what you would normally consider to be, almost academic computer music sounds, you know, there was like a hard, rough edge to it. It was, it was very bright and in your face, but you really took advantage of the continuum to make it sing. And so when you say that about kind of like honoring the, the singing part of music, I was imme I immediately thought of watching you play there because it was, you took what in other hands might have been kind of clangs, sounds, and you really extracted Beau Beauty and almost the humanity or, you know, or an organic quality out of 'em through the use of your playing style. And I thought that was really interesting because what it did was, first of all, it showed sort of your musicianship, but it also showed, what you could bring. You know, when you have that in your head, how you can transfer that into physical gestures that can make something like that, come out of, an electronic music instrument. It was, it was fascinating. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Edmund: </b>Oh, that's very kind of you Darwin to say that I have a very intimate knowledge and relationship with the instrument. It's really been, I've been involved so much in it. And, just to go back a bit to Kea, when, so, so the interesting about KEA <span style="color:red" data-ts="1351.885" data-end_ts="1352.005" title="1351.885" id=c_"1351.885">__is__</span> it's a very, it's an immediate dedicated DSP environment, and they have this structure that allows for a tremendous amount of exploration, if you want. And I developed mathematical structures for control, then I started to marry to the continuum. And okay. And then over a few years, what we did was, I had all these things that I'd sort of prebuilt. I was always going back to these bank of things that, you know, the way that the relationship and the pressure, how, how this structure's gonna go or how the, the pitch mapping goes and tambra changes. And I developed this whole sub lexicon within, Kea, which then we, what we did decided was we, we enjoyed working with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1397.515" data-end_ts="1397.805" title="1397.515" id=c_"1397.515">__Kima__</span>, but the continuum is an instrument that is, not easy in the sense that you have to practice.

<b>Edmund: </b>I would say it's easier than a violin or easier than a French horn, but it's still, when you go into the electronic world, we have this really weird setup where you don't think, you know, things are supposed to be easier for you, but, and if they're supposed to be expressive, well, if you're expressing easiness, that just shows surface thought. What you actually have to, to do is get really, really deep <span style="color:red" data-ts="1426.865" data-end_ts="1427.085" title="1426.865" id=c_"1426.865">__in__</span> design and dedicate to it, you know? Yeah. It's like I've, I've been able to dedicate to it. So when we developed the engine, I had all of this math that we could apply to the shark within that we decided to build into the continuum. And it's a structure that has been set up to take full advantage of an integration between this playing surface and the sound engine that is behind it. And, and we, we did that because people were getting frustrated by trying to integrate the continuum, which is hard enough to worry about and to play. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Edmund: </b>Right. And to work with something like kea, which is also hard to get into deeply, or even the plethora of, of, midi synthesizers out there, which were not designed. They were designed to work with switches, not with continuous control. Right. That's where the, the DSP engine came. And because of all that real deep integration, you can get your fingers to sing into the electrons. That's what I find, you know, I've heard that with other people, like, can't remember there was one, there's a guy named Mold <span style="color:red" data-ts="1494.565" data-end_ts="1494.765" title="1494.565" id=c_"1494.565">__Over__</span> who does some Yes. Beautiful things on guitar. Right. And there's a fellow that does Corg demos. He does, he plays the pads. He's very express, amazingly, I forget his name. Anyway, like, it is possible with these instruments, we can be more than just, an overseeing overseer of the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1515.415" data-end_ts="1515.765" title="1515.415" id=c_"1515.415">__mater__</span> within a system. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Edmund: </b><laugh>, you know, we can actually get in and start, start to shape that. I think a lot of people wanna do that. And I think there's a lot of musicianship that can be exposed, but it's easy also to be beguiled by that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1530.875" data-end_ts="1531.365" title="1530.875" id=c_"1530.875">__automat__</span> and say, you know, to fall in love with, especially working with modular synthesizer, falling in love with the sequencers and, and listening and that sort of thing. Right. Whenever I program a, a modular synthesizer, the first thing I do is I have a gate on it so that I purposely don't listen to the sequencer going all the time, or, you know, at building my structure. Because what happens is, is that I just, I don't construct a patch that is going to, allow me to play something. What I do is entertain myself as I explore this patch searching routine, and at the end of it, I've exhausted that entertainment. Right. And the continuum, it allows you to program that way too, where you're designing a sound to be performed. 'cause it's always under your fingers. It's one reason why we don't have very much sequencer control within the iMatrix structure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So you, you do that on purpose to make it, I <laugh> it's really interesting perspective and it's an interesting sort of constraint to put on the system to force playing. I, I think that's, that's an amazing insight. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Edmund: </b>Well, both lip <span style="color:red" data-ts="1604.865" data-end_ts="1605.085" title="1604.865" id=c_"1604.865">__old__</span> and I have the same, belief system that way. You know, it's like he does, like, he, I I gotta say that guy with that shark in there, he's the world expert in that shark, family. He does things. He's been into that code, he's found, I mean, just gone deep, deep into the, into the architecture of it. And so there's a lot of wonderful things that can happen when you dive deep into something that's never really been fully explored. Right. You know, like there's all these things going on and there's, there's design constraints when you say, okay, well, we're not gonna have any IO for external ram, so people who want to do a sampler, well, that's not gonna happen because there's only so much, ram in there. And the ram that is in there is, is limited in, in size, but it's extremely quickly addressable, which allows you to do all sorts of interesting things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Edmund: </b>You know, it's like people listen to this, this violin, viola cello bass sound that I ended up doing. And, it's a full range instrument. It goes all the way to below the contra <span style="color:red" data-ts="1671.475" data-end_ts="1671.765" title="1671.475" id=c_"1671.475">__base__</span> to as high as the violin can go over the full range of the continuum, which is larger than a grand piano. And that's all based on one 150 millisecond ana analysis of a viola D <span style="color:red" data-ts="1686.255" data-end_ts="1686.605" title="1686.255" id=c_"1686.255">__sharp__</span> <laugh>. And it's all because, because of that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1689.725" data-end_ts="1689.805" title="1689.725" id=c_"1689.725">__RA__</span> rapid access and the way that we can do granular and break up that system, you can, you can change it and make it completely work within all these different ranges. So that's one of the examples of when you, when you do a limited, you know, feature set, great things can come out of it. You know, Brian <span style="color:red" data-ts="1706.875" data-end_ts="1706.995" title="1706.875" id=c_"1706.875">__Eno__</span> said, you know, don't gimme more than three things, or I'm paraphrasing, but that's it. Because once you go past three, you know, you, you just start to get lost. You need, you need to focus. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's also interesting that, that this kind of, the concept of the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1722.355" data-end_ts="1722.515" title="1722.355" id=c_"1722.355">__GaN__</span> Matri really started off inside the chemo world, but you ended up really focusing on these kind of affordances between playing and access to the sound engine. It's interesting because, you know, whether you're talking about a chemo system or like in my case, max or whatever, so often you get into these like, programming systems and you either take a deep dive into the sound design or you take a deep dive into sequencing or generative work. But so often the attachment to controls and the attachment to the real world, you sort of like dash that off at the, at the end as if it was like, you know, it was like sort of a, a compulsory part of the exercises, but not something that's, that could be inspiring. And it sounds to me like you actually found that to be sort of the center of a different kind of exploration that you really maximized. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Edmund: </b>Yeah. So to do the gooey and the, that, that interface we use Max for the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1789.565" data-end_ts="1789.845" title="1789.565" id=c_"1789.565">__Egan__</span> matrix, and it's completely, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1792.635" data-end_ts="1792.925" title="1792.635" id=c_"1792.635">__that__</span> Max is just an absolutely amazing environment to work in. I just love it. It solves issues for us that we don't have to worry about Windows and Mac support because it's built in. So when we build the app, it's, it, you know, another <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_%2774">Cycling '74</a> is, is worrying about that, that integration for us. So it, it really frees us up. We didn't wanna do, we didn't wanna do anything really fancier than that. So within that constraint, knowing that we wanted to work with midi, we designed a system, and this comes back to my university days and being exposed to the EMS instruments, we had that beautiful Cynthia 100. Right. I had a Putney that was like, compared to the Cynthia, when I think about it now, the Putney had a dust cover on <span style="color:red" data-ts="1838.925" data-end_ts="1839.045" title="1838.925" id=c_"1838.925">__it__</span>, and I use it as a music stand, <laugh> a VCs three. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Edmund: </b>So, but what I loved about that was that instrument was this beautiful, patching matrix. Right. And, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1851.865" data-end_ts="1852.085" title="1851.865" id=c_"1851.865">__and__</span> not buffered either. So I mean, the, this thing would live as you patched it. The other parts of it, you know, it's like you're, you're loading things into this tippy boat, so as soon as you patch over here, you load it this side, now you gotta go over and adjust what the other side did. You get all this crosstalk great stuff. But that, that simple idea, just a patch matrix and deciding to, I mean, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1876.295" data-end_ts="1876.455" title="1876.295" id=c_"1876.295">__ego__</span> Matrixx, it's simple, but it's complex because the simplicity of it is that we built these, modules based on our, lip <span style="color:red" data-ts="1886.615" data-end_ts="1886.815" title="1886.615" id=c_"1886.615">__old__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1886.815" data-end_ts="1886.975" title="1886.815" id=c_"1886.815">__and__</span> my experience of, particular types of DSP design. What kind of things would be interesting to explore? What things can we breadboard in here and try them out? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Edmund: </b>There's a bunch of that in there too. Some things are more successful than others. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But we decided to make every single pin that when you patch every single pin is a formula that is a relationship of where your finger is in the three dimensional area, as well as some select automative. Like we have these phase generators, which are essentially, you could think of them as LFOs, but they're also under finger control, and they appear within a formula. So your pin is this particular formula, which can be relationship of a very simple formula. Let's just say you put your finger down, it puts out a constant, or it can be this really complicated, intimate relationship. And so that, that pinpoint that can be, once you plug it into the matrix, your finger is controlling the pin. So there are no VCAs within the design because your finger automatically does the multiplying to, in that column to get things out. And so it just means that within a patch, you can have dozens, just dozens of, of very particular points that integrate within that sound design. So when you play it, it doesn't even matter if it's, like you said, like play these kind of harsh electronic things. The musicality can come across. Right. Right. Yeah. Which is a real fantastic thing. I I really enjoy, I I'm still learning things about it. It's, it's great 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Working with these highly expressive controllers. Now, I, I don't own a continuum. I wish I did. I remember the first time that I ever touched one, I almost like jumped back because it felt, it, it felt so alive. Right. But you know, I've, I've worked with some other sort of express controllers, and one of the things that's interesting is the, the extent to which it sort of draws you, or <span style="color:red" data-ts="2012.555" data-end_ts="2012.755" title="2012.555" id=c_"2012.555">__it__</span>, it sort of almost requires you to reengage with the concept of virtuosity. I mean, you talked a little bit about how modern electronic music is sort of set up to make it feel like you're an overlord of a system as opposed to an instrument player. Right. But, the, the continuum and, and especially the people who are designing for it are, and, and working with it on making patches and chemo or max or whatever, are more and more becoming really focused on things that require virtuosity on the things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So this idea of like, we don't have any VCAs, because now your touch is, provides that functionality. Right. How do you allow people to get an introduction to an instrument like that? I mean, one of the things that we look at is the, the re the only reason it seems that people take up violin anymore is because a previous generation had done violin <laugh>. You know, so they're sort of like compelled to say, well, if I wanna sound like it's Ox Pearlman, I have to take the violin. How do you with a new instrument that requires some virtuosity draw people into playing it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Edmund: </b>Yeah, that's a good question. Darwin, you know, if someone plays a violin, what they're picking up on, or a piano or a viola or a flute, centuries of fine tuning of humanity, putting their fingers on this thing and refining and refining and refining. And also at the same time, you're inheriting the dedication of composers that wrote for it. So they brought out the musicality within the instruments, and the instruments kind of go hand in hand with what kind of compositions, compositions inspired instruments, and vice versa. So if you get into that world, there's this whole historical content context that, you can exploit, and take advantage of and, revel in that is, a real good lifelong goal. You know, I, I, I think those are great things to do with something new like the continuum. We don't have much of a history like we play. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Edmund: </b>We, we, we played a little bit of the last, con continue, continue <span style="color:red" data-ts="2165.105" data-end_ts="2165.325" title="2165.105" id=c_"2165.105">__con__</span> concert. We did some messian, things that were written for Martino or, in the next, continue Con that was coming up at Ham in, in late April, we're gonna be playing a, six a piece for six, three Trians that, Paul <span style="color:red" data-ts="2183.325" data-end_ts="2183.565" title="2183.325" id=c_"2183.325">__Hindemith__</span> wrote right when Oscar Sala was, was working with him. So we can go into that, that kind of repertoire, which is relatively new repertoire when you compare the repertoire that you get within the, you know, piano literature or a violent literature. Right. So, yeah, in terms of having people get interested in it, I mean, it's something that's new. All I can tell when people ask me about it is that it is worth dedicating your life to. I mean, I, I found so much great musical enjoyment. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Edmund: </b>I it, and it gets better and better every day. You know, it's like it's, and I, I have absolutely, this is nothing to say against anyone who is also a, you know, loves to let the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2228.195" data-end_ts="2228.485" title="2228.195" id=c_"2228.195">__mata__</span> go under control and, and have some other sort of meta role within the musical structure. I think that's an equally valid thing. And I've just heard amazingly beautiful things come outta that quite complex, seemingly chaotic, but within this grander scheme of, of, design that that can go on. You know, someone like Richard Divine comes to mind in that sort of, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>One of the things that you mentioned that I hadn't even thought about was taking advantage of some of the kind of modernish instruments for which a certain amount of of composition had been done. Like the, the Martino, for example. And I, at first it's, it's sort of like, well, you know, why, why would you, you know, why would you need to do that? But then if I think about it, or why would you want to do that? But if I think about it, there was an awful lot of music that was composed for Lutts that nobody's playing with lutts, they're using, they're using classical guitars for Right. Or things that were originally written for harpsichord that people regularly play on piano. I think it's actually kind of interesting to consider that some of these things like, like music written for a eronium or for a Martino might, might well be a great case of compositions that are viable for, a continuum player. That's really fascinating. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Edmund: </b>Yes. And, and, you know, you can sort of extend that out to think about, you know, when we listen to a a a a Mozart Sonata, it doesn't sound like the way it was written. It wasn't, that's not the instrument it was written for. Right. You know, the piano's gone through a tremendous revolution, evolution too. So, you know, all these instruments, they're dynamic thereof the day. And we're, we're in a time now where, this digital electronic re revolution we're in. I mean, this is this acceleration curve that we're going through in terms of things changing. I mean, it's just, I I, I can only see it becoming just more and more mind blowing, right? Where we're at really at the cusp of the quantum computer too, which is going to, you know, dramatically change our world and change the ideas that we have. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Edmund: </b>But, but within all that, we still have, you know, this musicianship, this primal thing that, the human part that comes about, the most beautiful thing when, when my <span style="color:red" data-ts="2377.515" data-end_ts="2377.755" title="2377.515" id=c_"2377.515">__asked__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2377.755" data-end_ts="2378.035" title="2377.755" id=c_"2377.755">__would__</span> say, well, what's the most beautiful thing the continuum does for you? And what the continuum has done is it's improved my ear to listen to harmonics and temperament, and I've re rediscovered just the beauty of just intervals. You know, and I've always wondered why, why am I so beguiled by Kronos Quartet? You know, when I listened to the Terry Riley, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2405.005" data-end_ts="2405.355" title="2405.005" id=c_"2405.005">__Solom__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2405.355" data-end_ts="2405.475" title="2405.355" id=c_"2405.355">__ma__</span> Dances for Peace, right? And I listen to this thing, I'd go, you know, there's just something about this musicianship, and these people are playing all these adjusted intervals, and the continuum <span style="color:red" data-ts="2418.125" data-end_ts="2418.415" title="2418.125" id=c_"2418.125">__give__</span> can give you that ability. I mean, it's, it's, it can micro, like it's lipo was telling me, you know, there's some numbers, when you ever ask him numbers, he's always a little evasive because there's, he knows what the, what the things are, but it's like microns you're dealing with, right. In terms of how your fingers move. It's just an amazing system, and it allows you to do this fine tuning that you don't even realize you're doing until you, you listen back and you, you go, wow, every single third, major third, I'm playing that third flat because it just sounds right. Right. And it also depends on the, the patch that you're doing. So you tend to play simpler sounds on the continuum, and they just <span style="color:red" data-ts="2458.615" data-end_ts="2458.775" title="2458.615" id=c_"2458.615">__have__</span> seem to have more life. Like I, I can play a sine wave on that thing forever. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, and again, it, it ends up, you know, inspired watching you, but, you know, another person who was a continuing user whose, whose work I loved was, was Richard Linhart. He, evokes such beauty with his playing, and, you know, yeah, it was, some of it was the fact that it was hooked up to Brooklyn doing that thing, but a lot of it was, he was very mindful about his playing technique on that instrument surface. And it, it ended up having his voice, which was, which is I think one of the things that expressive controllers allow you to do, it really allows you to have a voice come through these electronic instruments. Like you said, you're reaching in and you're like making the electrons sing. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Edmund: </b>Yeah. And, and Richard, he's, he was amazing. And the thing that he did with that bookla, he developed a patch that he didn't change. Yeah. Because he had a world that he could explore in there. And he realized, man, I've, I've di dived dived into this very particular part of this musical universe that I exist in, and I'm finding great inspiration and joy in it. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2537.765" data-end_ts="2537.885" title="2537.765" id=c_"2537.765">__I__</span>, I, it's just amazing when I saw see videos, when he was playing, and, yeah, he had a, a, a really nice approach to the music that he brought <span style="color:red" data-ts="2546.925" data-end_ts="2547.125" title="2546.925" id=c_"2546.925">__and__</span> his continuum playing. And that booklet patch with just the, a sea of, of, of, of cable seaweed in front of it. <laugh>. I know. I don't know how he, you know, that's the one thing about, you know, the Euro rack and, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2559.265" data-end_ts="2559.485" title="2559.265" id=c_"2559.265">__and__</span> that kind of size of things.

Very nice thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, unfortunately our time is already up and I feel like I'm just getting started, but, so that means that we're <span style="color:red" data-ts="2572.645" data-end_ts="2572.765" title="2572.645" id=c_"2572.645">__gonna__</span> have to talk again, soon. But before I let you go, I am a little curious about Continue <span style="color:red" data-ts="2579.865" data-end_ts="2580.085" title="2579.865" id=c_"2579.865">__Con__</span>, it's something that came up. It comes up when I talked to our friend, Clifton Cameron. He's a friend of both ears of mine, but it <span style="color:red" data-ts="2589.125" data-end_ts="2589.405" title="2589.125" id=c_"2589.125">__come__</span>, it came up when I talked to, Dr. Hacken as well. Can you describe a little bit what those are? I think the first wasn't the first one last year. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Edmund: </b>We've had two so far. Oh, you've 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Had two so 
</p>

<p>
<b>Edmund: </b>Far? Yeah. So the, the way <span style="color:red" data-ts="2605.755" data-end_ts="2606.045" title="2605.755" id=c_"2605.755">__well__</span> continue con is like this, it is like a family reunion of a family that's completely functional. So it's not like a Thanksgiving dinner where you're going to meet that uncle that just creeps you out, <laugh>, you know, everybody, it's people go, go there because they want to, and, and they enjoy it. The first two were in Asheville, North Carolina, because Asheville, strangely, or not strangely beautifully enough, has the largest con collection of continuums, which is not that large. I mean, we're talking about instruments that, you know, the, I don't know how many are <span style="color:red" data-ts="2642.165" data-end_ts="2642.525" title="2642.165" id=c_"2642.165">__stands__</span>, 600, maybe 700. So, and, and, and it's a gathering of, the first two were there, and it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2649.665" data-end_ts="2649.885" title="2649.665" id=c_"2649.665">__was__</span>, it's a gathering of roughly 25 to 35, 40 people. Every, everything's about the continuum. We talk about, I do talks about the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2658.085" data-end_ts="2658.285" title="2658.085" id=c_"2658.085">__ego__</span> matrix, and the next one that's gonna be at Hamm in Paris, I'm gonna talk, I'm gonna <span style="color:red" data-ts="2663.165" data-end_ts="2663.325" title="2663.165" id=c_"2663.165">__take__</span> one talk, is, is just deconstructing one preset and going through every formula and talking about why I did what I did, you know, and what the influence of, of, and then we have concerts where people perform in the evening, and the concerts are quite amazing because it's the equivalent of, if you, if you said if you invited all these guitarists, you know, you would have everything from classical to Segovia to Steve <span style="color:red" data-ts="2691.125" data-end_ts="2691.245" title="2691.125" id=c_"2691.125">__V__</span> to, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Edmund: </b>Right. There's just such a wide range, and the continuum really brings in all that, that wide range of, musicianship and musical styles as well. So it's, it's, it's a real great thing. And we've had some people come to the conference who don't have continuums. So, but Clifton has come and it's, it's always great to see him. I really enjoy his presence. I don't see him very often. He's been, doing, being our, continuum rep at the NAMM Show, because he is right in LA there. It's right. Very handy for us. But we, we, we tend to, now just go to the super booth in, Berlin. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's becoming a popular place for, for this kinda stuff because, it draws a real focused community together.

<b>Edmund: </b>Oh, it's fantastic. If you've, if you've, I mean, I can't, I can't say enough about Super Booth. If you're in, if you're into this, well, first of all, you're going to Berlin, right. Which is way better than going to Frankfurt. Yeah. Berlin is such a fascinating, wonderful city, and, Schneider's bureau and Schneider's Law and, Andreas Schneider, he, he runs a great show, and it's all in this huge children's museum. It's a reappropriated building in next to a park. It's wonderful. And there's just all sorts. I mean, if you're into Eurorack, it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2768.125" data-end_ts="2768.645" title="2768.125" id=c_"2768.125">__eurorack__</span> heaven. But there's all sorts of other things. There's all sorts of, wonderful, you know, people in that community that I get to, touch base with again and just see all these different ideas going. And, there's a lot of amazing passion for the, you know, for that instrument building. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Edmund: </b>That, that end of it is very cool for me. And we just, it's a nice way for us to, I mean, we try to advertise the continuum, but it, but it's, you know, there're not many around. So the thing is, we, it's nice when you can get it into a place where people can try it and, and you know, because like you, you know, when you played it, it's like all of a sudden you're, you're, you're realizing, oh geez, there's, there's, there is something here that, the one fault of the continuum I would say is that when I play, you know, you might as well watch paint drawing <laugh> because it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2821.005" data-end_ts="2821.285" title="2821.005" id=c_"2821.005">__just__</span> the, the movements are so, our fingers are so actually sensitive, right. That you don't have to move very far to do that. You know? So there's a lot that happens in the continuum that it's just micro movements that you, you, you just, we, you need a basically a, a, a jewelers loop in front of the <laugh> to to, to catch it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Edmund: </b>So that visual aspect is really lacking within it. But, it's more tied to the way that the, I think the human body reacts and we've been able to take advantage of, in the electronic world not having acoustic constraints, you know, that the body has to be this size and the string needs to be this long and this hard to play, because that's the kind of sound that you want to get. You're, you do have that freedom, but within that freedom you have to design a haptic system that has the appropriate amount of, of feedback. And what, what we've learned is that, and much like you see the way pianos and synthesizers develops, where the touch on a synthesizer is much lighter. 'cause it can be, you know Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, right. And, and the, and the continuum is lighter because it can be. So you, you learn to adjust to that and you end up having it's within the right muscular range of, of finger movement that, we found <span style="color:red" data-ts="2894.945" data-end_ts="2895.165" title="2894.945" id=c_"2894.945">__is__</span>, has created the maximum expressiveness. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Indeed. Well, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2899.565" data-end_ts="2899.725" title="2899.565" id=c_"2899.565">__Emin__</span>, I want to thank you so much for taking the time outta your schedule. This has been a fascinating chat. I can't wait for the next time we get to talk, or maybe the next time that we get a chance to run into each other. I, if nothing else, I, every year I try and find a way to make it to Super Booth or, maybe I can get you to come to a Knob <span style="color:red" data-ts="2921.185" data-end_ts="2921.405" title="2921.185" id=c_"2921.185">__Con__</span> or something like that. We can find some way to Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Edmund: </b>You the place Oh, go to Epcon in Chicago with suit <span style="color:red" data-ts="2926.485" data-end_ts="2926.685" title="2926.485" id=c_"2926.485">__and__</span> tga. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2927.485" data-end_ts="2927.565" title="2927.485" id=c_"2927.485">__am__</span>, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2927.765" data-end_ts="2927.805" title="2927.765" id=c_"2927.765">__am__</span> hoping to, one of the problems for me with that is that it's, it's always the same weekend as my anniversary, but I think I can trick my wife into going to the lovely city of Chicago and just slip away. Right. <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Edmund: </b><laugh>. Yeah. I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2942.885" data-end_ts="2942.965" title="2942.885" id=c_"2942.885">__want__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm sure that'll go over that show yet. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Edmund: </b>Yeah. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's supposed to be a, a pretty neat thing as well. But anyway, we'll find a way to get together at some point. But in the meantime, I want to thank you for your time and, I'll let you have the rest of your day. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Edmund: </b>Well, it's been a pleasure, Darwin. It's very nice to, chat with you and Yes, I do hope we do it again soon. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright, sounds great. Talk to you soon. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Edmund: </b>Okay. Take care. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. I want to thank Edmund a lot for having a chat today. It was, really great to get caught up with him. We've heard so much about him over the years, and so it was really fantastic. So thanks <span style="color:red" data-ts="2982.525" data-end_ts="2982.805" title="2982.525" id=c_"2982.525">__team__</span> for that. Thanks for <span style="color:red" data-ts="2984.255" data-end_ts="2984.605" title="2984.255" id=c_"2984.255">__Cliff__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2984.605" data-end_ts="2984.765" title="2984.605" id=c_"2984.605">__and__</span> Cameron for helping out, with getting him in play as well. I really appreciate it. And I want to thank you, the listeners for showing up again this week. It's great as always to hear from those that have written me and very encouraging to see the number of additions we had to the YouTube page. Again, I'll remind you, one of the things we're trying to do for the podcast here is bump up our YouTube subscriptions. So if you can just sort of like track this podcast down in YouTube, use that as a way to sign up for a subscription that'll help us out a lot. In the meantime, just keep on keeping on. Check us out next week when we'll have you at another fascinating interview. And as always, if you wanna drop me a line, DDG at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_%2774">Cycling '74</a> I'll do it. Thanks a lot and we'll catch you next week. Bye.
