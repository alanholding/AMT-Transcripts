<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, well, I kind of dorked things up this week. I was out in San Francisco for a visit and kind of, lost my way, kind of beat me up a little bit. But as a result, I came home and forgot to set up an interview for this week. So I very quickly jumped on Facebook. I am Darwin gross in case you want a friend up with me, but I jumped on a Facebook and I asked people to gimme some suggestions for quick turnaround on an interview participant. And I got a lot of great feedback on that. So actually I've got a whole list of people that are gonna be making up the next few podcasts. But, one of the suggestions that came through that I thought was really interesting was to talk to Jeff Snyder from Snyder phonics. He is the person who created the manta, interface controller and, which I actually use. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I find it a fasting and wonderful tool. And so I reached out to him and he got back to me really quickly and we were on. And so this morning I jumped on the line with him. We got a quick interview in, and it wasn't quick at all because, as so often happens with these podcasts. Once we start getting into things a little bit, there are so many twists and turns that we can take as we learn more about each individual creative person's approach to how they do the work that they do. So I hope that you enjoy this, this little chat with Jeff Snyder from SNY phonics. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>All right, this week we have a very cool guest. It's someone that I've met over the years in a number of different contexts. His name is Jeff Snyder And, most of you would probably know him as the creator of the manta, a really unique control surface, kind of playable instrument that interfaces with your computer. It really is reminiscent of a lot of the kind of touch surfaces that you found in, old Bule days. I guess, at least for me, it's a, it feels like that. But Jeff is a really accomplished builder of things. And, that's one of the things we're gonna want to talk to him about today. Hi, Jeff, how are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff Snyder: </b>Hi, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thanks a lot for, helping us out on kind of short notice this week. I was traveling kind of got off my, off my schedule and, was kind of scrambling at the last minute. I appreciate you taking the time to talk to us. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Yeah, no problem. It's great. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, what I like to do with these, especially for people that are kind of doing really creative work is to touch base on what your background is because, you are doing these incredible, instruments. In addition to the <span style="color:red" data-ts="190.17" data-end_ts="190.52" title="190.17" id=c_"190.17">__manta__</span>, you've done some custom things. It looks like you might be working on something for a future potential Kickstarter or something mm-hmm <affirmative>. But I'm just wondering what your background is and, and what kind of got you to the place you're at now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>I started basically playing guitar and bass in rock bands, as I guess a lot of people do. I had a <span style="color:red" data-ts="214.33" data-end_ts="214.55" title="214.33" id=c_"214.33">__SCO__</span> band in high school, so I started to learn how to write for horns through that. And for some reason we also had a violin player. So I kind of like got used to writing for acoustic instruments. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Then I went to college, not knowing what I was gonna major in, but, I decided to do music composition and, yeah, kind of went from there. I went to school in Wisconsin, Madison, which was really fun. And, I had some really great teachers there, so that was kind of, I, I was always kind of into experimental music actually, even in, in high school. I remember going to the, going to the public library and getting, CDs of <span style="color:red" data-ts="266.48" data-end_ts="266.77" title="266.48" id=c_"266.48">__poly__</span> Olivers or like things like that. And I, I remember, I found out about John <span style="color:red" data-ts="273.61" data-end_ts="273.73" title="273.61" id=c_"273.61">__Z__</span> from listening to Mr bun, which was like a rock band back then in the nineties. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>And, and I saw that John ZN produced it. So then I looked him up and then I bought his albums and then I bought the albums of everybody else who was playing on those, you know, and sort of learned about the New York improv scene through that, and about kind of that sort of downtown side of, of new music. Right. Got really excited about it. When I went to undergrad, I learned a little more about the more, the more, classical 20th century music tradition, which was also really exciting to me. So it's been a while learning to, you know, write for orchestral instruments, things like that. And I started to get into instrument building probably mostly through the inspiration from Harry parch. So I don't know how many of your listeners are familiar with Harry parch, but, he's this amazing composer from the mid-century, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? Yeah. If they're not, if they're not familiar, this gives him an opportunity to Google it because he's fascinating character. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Oh my God, he's so cool. So, and, I was in Wisconsin, Madison, which is actually where Harry parch started doing his instrument building. He got a, in the forties, he got a grant to hang out in the architecture department at UW Madison and build his instruments cuz the music department didn't want anything to do with him apparently except for, gunner Johansen, the pianist <span style="color:red" data-ts="367.36" data-end_ts="367.52" title="367.36" id=c_"367.36">__who__</span> kind of brought him there. So, I got pretty fascinated with his work and I was also got really interested in, alternate tuning systems. Mm-hmm <affirmative>, which is sort of one of the things that Harry parch kind of, led a resurgence in interest into tuning systems beyond 12 tone equal temperament, which is how the pianos tuned. So, in his day back in, you know, when he started in the forties on this stuff, electronic instruments weren't really available. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>I mean, the Fairman existed, things like that, but you know, it wasn't really, you couldn't really solve your tuning problems electronically very easily and that wasn't his vibe, right? So he was making these acoustic instruments, in order to be able to play in the tuning systems that he wanted to do. And also making these instruments that were really sculptural objects, right? So they're these beautiful objects that he saw performing, performing with him as this part of this whole presentation. So he was kind of interested in ancient Greek theater and things like that and wanted to basically does this strange mashup of, of his own idea of what ancient Greek theater was like, plus like his experience as a hobo, riding trains and depression and things like that. It's, it's pretty interesting. So I was, I was really inspired by that and by the whole kind of concept of him sort of going his own way and saying, all right, you know, I'm not interested in writing for the violin. I just want to build my own stuff and kind of make my own musical world starting from the ground up, you know? Right. And I found that just really ambitious and exciting. So, <span style="color:red" data-ts="478.34" data-end_ts="478.56" title="478.34" id=c_"478.34">__it__</span>, in my final year of, school at Madison, I decided I was going to try to build an instrument in an alternative tuning that I made up. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>And, I made a string instrument with these, and if you're making a string instrument like a guitar, but you want it to be in an alternative tuning <span style="color:red" data-ts="500.02" data-end_ts="500.24" title="500.02" id=c_"500.02">__and__</span> it's actually really frustrating because the frets need to be different for every string. Right. Right. So was, is kind of a, kind of a pain of the butt, but also cool looking <laugh>. So, so I made these, I made this string instrument that had, and I tried to make it with these removable fretboards so that you could, you could, put different, different Fred <span style="color:red" data-ts="520.64" data-end_ts="520.84" title="520.64" id=c_"520.64">__board__</span> on right. When you wanted to change tunings. And I made up this tuning that I thought would be really cool that I wanted to try out. And, and actually I think it was a pretty successful instrument in that it sounded really interesting mm-hmm <affirmative> but I realized after I made it that I didn't basically couple months after I built it and was playing with <span style="color:red" data-ts="543.84" data-end_ts="543.96" title="543.84" id=c_"543.84">__it__</span> a lot, I didn't really like the tuning system I'd made up <laugh> so I was like, oh, I want a new tuning system. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>But then it had taken me like a month to, I, I also, I had friend, I had helped from a friend who was a sculptor yeah. To make the, to make the fretboard and, you know, and I was like, ah, I don't know if I have the skill to do this on my own. And to make another frat <span style="color:red" data-ts="566.16" data-end_ts="566.36" title="566.16" id=c_"566.16">__board__</span> was kind of like just too, too much work, so, right, right. I ended up not really using it. And that was really frustrating to me. So that's kind of why I got into the idea of using electronics mostly. I mean, I'd been playing electronics for a long time. I had a, I bought a, a Kai sampler in high school and I played a lot with that. I was really excited about like noise music and stuff and made noise music on my sampler. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>But I didn't know, I didn't know that much about the internal guts of say, like, I didn't really know how to do, how to make my own audio software. I didn't study like computer science or anything in undergrad. I was just straight music. So the idea of sort of making something, programming something or building analog electronics or anything to, to kind of do what I wanted to do electronically, instead of acoustically with this instrument building was, pretty challenging to me. And I kind of realized that I needed to learn that stuff in order to be able to do what I wanted to do and to make a situation where in the future, if I built some instrument and wanted to change the tuning system or something about it, I could just change some code. Right. And it would be a lot easier. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>So, so that kind of set me on the path that I'm on right now, basically of, of, building these instruments. And let's see, I don't know how to describe where I went next. I took a break from school for a year, lived in Chicago and, played in a band covering video game songs <laugh> and then, with it was a family band with my sister and my brother-in-law, that was really fun, the power ups. And then, then I went to grad school in New York, <span style="color:red" data-ts="678.52" data-end_ts="678.74" title="678.52" id=c_"678.52">__at__</span> Columbia. And that was just a fantastic experience for me, just one of the best things that happened in my life. And there I met, Douglas Rapo and Brad <span style="color:red" data-ts="691.14" data-end_ts="691.46" title="691.14" id=c_"691.14">__garden__</span> who were kind of, Brad runs the electronic, the computer music center at Columbia. And then, Douglas is, is currently the director of the sound art program there at the time that didn't exist yet. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="706.3" data-end_ts="706.5" title="706.3" id=c_"706.3">__Right__</span>. He was connected to the CMC. <span style="color:red" data-ts="708.36" data-end_ts="708.58" title="708.36" id=c_"708.36">__Yep__</span>. But, basically the two of them had all of the skills that I wanted in order to figure this stuff out. And while I lived in Madison, I met Greg Taylor who works for, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_%2774">Cycling '74</a> and Darwin Udo <span style="color:red" data-ts="723.66" data-end_ts="723.88" title="723.66" id=c_"723.66">__web__</span> very well. Yes I do. <laugh> <span style="color:red" data-ts="726.65" data-end_ts="727" title="726.65" id=c_"726.65">__cause__</span> Greg lived in Madison and he was, he was working for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_%2774">Cycling '74</a> which made max MSP. And he was like, you really should get, you know, at the time I was all on windows and, and it's like, and max wasn't for windows. Right. But it's like, you should get a Mac and you should learn max <laugh>. So the year, the summer before I went to grad school, I was like, all right, I gotta do this. I need to, I need to show up and actually know what the hell I'm doing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>So went through all the tutorials and started to learn how to do computer music rather than just, sort of using prefab hardware. Like I was with, my samplers and stuff in my, in my current live setup at the time. Yeah. And then meeting Doug Rapo meant that I got to basically, so Doug had all this hardware experience and up until then, the, the only thing I'd really done with hardware was like, copy guitar, pedals. Right? <span style="color:red" data-ts="782.09" data-end_ts="782.44" title="782.09" id=c_"782.09">__Cause__</span> online, you can find schematics for guitar pedals and, and sort of there's enough information to, without much knowledge about what you're doing to put things together. It was a really awesome way for me to kind of get into it because it's like, Hey, you get a guitar pedal at the end of it. And you don't need to get into the theory too much, but it gets you familiar with kind of like how things are constructed, and how electricity works. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>And then, but then meeting Doug, he kind of got me on the path of, okay, well, let's learn how to program a micro controller and okay. Make a <span style="color:red" data-ts="813.72" data-end_ts="813.84" title="813.72" id=c_"813.72">__B__</span> make a box that can sense buttons. And you know, and I always had these like way, way too big <laugh> goals, you know, I'd be like, Hey, I'm gonna make this thing as blah blah. And he's like, okay, why don't you make a box that has four buttons on it? And then when you push the buttons, <span style="color:red" data-ts="829.48" data-end_ts="829.64" title="829.48" id=c_"829.48">__the__</span> computer knows that they were pushed. I'm like, okay, I think I can do that. <laugh> right. Right. You know, <laugh> so I had to be reigned in a lot and then, but that way I, I got all the knowledge I really needed. And, so on the hardware side, Doug Rapo was just fantastic for getting me to kind of learn what I needed to learn and, and giving me guidance to sort of where to find the information I needed. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>And it's amazing that now, like you can really learn how to do hardware stuff online, you know, a few great books taught me things, physical computing from, Tom IGO and Dan Sullivan over at, NYU ITP. Right. That's got some really that kind of got me passed a lot of initial hurdles, cuz it's really designed for artists who wanna get into that kind of engineering, handmade electronic music, by Nick Collins is another really great one to get into that stuff. And then on the software side, Brad <span style="color:red" data-ts="890.08" data-end_ts="890.36" title="890.08" id=c_"890.08">__garden__</span> had these amazing skills to just help me learn to program from kind of not knowing how to program. So, yeah, so those kind of skills started accruing and I was gradually becoming able to do what I wanted to do. And I, since I still had this kind of dream from the Harry parch inspiration of sort of building my own ensemble of instruments, by the, by the end of my time there, I kind of had started to develop several different instruments that at that point I kind of had enough skill to pull off, even though for the most part I was learning what I needed to do while I did them. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>So I, I, the manta came out of that. So this is, you mentioned it earlier, this, touch controller, that's kind of like hex, hexagonal grid of buttons. And that was a bit inspired by some of these tuning theory people, Irv Wilson, right. Is somebody who's really interested in geometric layouts of tuning systems. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I was gonna say, even though I, I, the touch part of it reminds me of like booklet touch plate stuff, it's really that, sort of the honeycomb layout that really screams Irv Wilson. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Yeah, definitely. And I mean, it's, it's in a lot of ways, it's a combination of the influence of those two. So yeah. I didn't even mention that Don Bule influence yet, but at Columbia, when I was in grad school, we had a Bulo 100 and 200 system. So that was kind of combined from the probably late sixties into the mid seventies of a bunch of different modules that had been there since that time period, which, I believe was kind of put into a closet for a long time until right before I got there, when James Faye took it <span style="color:red" data-ts="1001.96" data-end_ts="1002.08" title="1001.96" id=c_"1001.96">__outta__</span> the closet and got it, got it bumping. And that thing was amazing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>We had, we had the, this, I had access to that to just kind of get involved in analog electronics, which I didn't know anything about at the time. Right. And, we also had a surge, a surge system, by surge rein in the same room. So I got kind of an interesting introduction to the experimental analog module or world of the sixties and seventies, and sort of the different design ideas that both of those designers had, which I find amazing. Like both of them are my favorite instrument designers. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> when, when was it, when was it that, that this was occurring? This is like late two thousands, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Yeah, this is, yeah. This is kind of mid two thousands or yeah, mid to late two thousands. I got to Columbia in 2003. Okay. And I, and I left in 2010 technically. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Got 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>It. So, over the seven years of kind of having access to these analog <span style="color:red" data-ts="1065.8" data-end_ts="1066.08" title="1065.8" id=c_"1065.8">__sense__</span>, getting inspired by that, having, you, you know, getting really dorked out on the tuning theory stuff. <laugh>, I did a, I did kind of a, a presentation about Ben Johnston's tuning theory, work. He's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1082.24" data-end_ts="1082.32" title="1082.24" id=c_"1082.24">__a__</span> really interesting, tuning theorist. Who's inspired by Harry parch and kind of takes things a little further. And then I, all along the time I was also writing my own music. So, before I had built these instruments, I was writing music for acoustic instruments, you know, puns, right. String <span style="color:red" data-ts="1101.16" data-end_ts="1101.36" title="1101.16" id=c_"1101.16">__for__</span> texts and things like that. Right. And then, yeah, and by the time, by like 2007, 2008, I had gotten these, I'd gotten a couple instruments that I'd built together. So the manta was kind of the first one, I think, to really, really come together. It went through a whole bunch of iterations. I've still got all of these prototypes, <laugh> in a closet that are hilarious to look at. One of them I call the Soviet prototype is like just like super huge and pretty clunky and, you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Know, and weighs 80 pounds. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Right. Exactly. Yeah. <laugh> and it's like, and, and I, I etched the copper myself, you know, so it's like, it's like all corroded and it just looks pretty awesome. So, but it's a, it's pretty, you know, on that one, I, I learned that I needed the sensors to be closer together to make it comfortable for your fingers, you know? And then on another one I would learn, okay, well, this sensor shape that I designed is not, not ideal for getting a nice straight line when you cover up the sensor with more of your finger and things like that. So, right. I kind of like iterated through these different prototypes to try to get an idea of, what would work and what my goal with the manta for myself was I wanted to make something that implemented these geometric layouts for weird tuning systems, like her Wilson's theories and things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>And then, or it made them easy to play on a keyboard where on a piano keyboard, they don't make as much sense. Right. And then I also wanted something that would let me, independently with each, each key would let me, have more control over the shape of the sound rather than just pushing a button and then letting go. And like, how hard did you push it? The standard kind of keyboard input. Right. And now there's actually, there's, there's a couple of other products that have come out lately that have, that have, been approaching the same kind of problem. Like Keith McMillan has a new thing that does this now, too. Right, right. As kind of independent sense of control and, what's his name? And <span style="color:red" data-ts="1234.58" data-end_ts="1235.06" title="1234.58" id=c_"1234.58">__Roger Lynn__</span> is doing right. The Lynch <span style="color:red" data-ts="1236.9" data-end_ts="1237.1" title="1236.9" id=c_"1236.9">__print__</span>, which is pretty interesting too. Yeah. So at the time, nothing really existed like that though, that I knew of, I'm pretty sure nothing existed that did this <laugh> well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I I've got a list of like 50 questions here. Mm-hmm <affirmative> so if we could kind of just 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Go for it. Yeah, yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. First of all, I think it's really interesting, the set of people that, that you use to kind of help you guide your journey. Gregory's probably a really great influencer influencer because not only is the work that he does, pretty inspiring, but he also is so knowledgeable about so many things. Mm-hmm <affirmative> and to have him kind of as a, a person you could get some guidance from is pretty, is pretty incredible. What kind of things did. So this is when you were still in Madison mm-hmm <affirmative> what kind of things did he do to sort of, sort of set up, set you up to take, take a specific direction? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Hmm. So, yeah, I mean, my interaction with him in Madison was, you know, he kind of, he influenced me a bit, but he was also sort of, sort of a background character. Like I initially knew him as the person who played suing the flute in the Golan ensemble that I played in. Okay. And I was like, oh, he's just this guy that comes in and plays the flute, whatever we have a concert, but he is not at the rehearsal <span style="color:red" data-ts="1322.64" data-end_ts="1322.96" title="1322.64" id=c_"1322.64">__where__</span> this guy. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>And then, and then I think I got to know him a little better when, along with Paula Matthew who, you know, her too. Right, right. Or, you know, her work. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1336.64" data-end_ts="1336.84" title="1336.64" id=c_"1336.64">__Yeah__</span>. So she teaches at Wesley now, but we were in the same year at, Madison in composition. It was actually, it was a totally amazing group of, of three people in composition there. Yeah. Where it was me, Paula Matthewson and Ryan Ross <span style="color:red" data-ts="1352.89" data-end_ts="1353.24" title="1352.89" id=c_"1352.89">__Smith__</span>. Who's currently at RPI doing really interesting stuff too. Wow. Wow. But, I feel like we all, and then, the first year it also involved, Ryan Carter. Who's a really great composer. Who's doing great stuff in, in New York too. You might know his stuff. He, he made a new kind of iPhone app using RTC mix. Oh, okay. That, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1372.59" data-end_ts="1372.88" title="1372.59" id=c_"1372.59">__that__</span> it's, yeah. It's amazing where it's like this interactive dance music album where you can, where you can adjust parameters.

I can't remember the, the name of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1383.22" data-end_ts="1383.44" title="1383.22" id=c_"1383.22">__the__</span>, the, his pseudonym. Yeah. But, look up Brian Carter. And then, so I got a lot of influence from those people and sort of my cohorts and, Paula and I decided to try to set up this, like bring some of these New York people where we were really interested in over to the, over to Madison. So we got a grant to bring, Elliot sharp and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1409.26" data-end_ts="1409.48" title="1409.26" id=c_"1409.26">__eco__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1409.56" data-end_ts="1409.64" title="1409.56" id=c_"1409.56">__way__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1409.71" data-end_ts="1410" title="1409.71" id=c_"1409.71">__Mori__</span> to come play at, the student union in Madison, which was pretty crazy. Yeah. And, so we brought them there and then that's actually, I think that's when I met Greg Taylor <span style="color:red" data-ts="1420.11" data-end_ts="1420.4" title="1420.11" id=c_"1420.11">__more__</span> because he knew them. So he was like, Hey, I want to go say hi to these guys. So then we like went out to dinner, dinner with Greg and Elliott and Equa. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Right. And me and Paula and, and it was like at that conversation that I was talking to to Greg, and he was kind of like, yeah, you really need to learn, you know, it's like, you're doing all this stuff, but you gotta learn what's inside what you're doing so that you got more power, you know? Right. And, and it was, it was him and also <span style="color:red" data-ts="1446.26" data-end_ts="1446.68" title="1446.26" id=c_"1446.26">__Steven__</span> DSKY, who <span style="color:red" data-ts="1447.32" data-end_ts="1447.44" title="1447.32" id=c_"1447.32">__was__</span> my teacher who were kind of both guiding me a little bit towards that, that idea. And I hadn't really realized that until kind of that it was probably my final year there or something of like, yeah, I really like if, if I could get some of those technical skills under my hat, I'd, I'd be able to do so much more, you know? And, and it's true. It's like once I, it just opens up so much of a, of a world once you really get the, the skills 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You like, a lot of people you have taken this track from being sort of, blinders on musician person mm-hmm <affirmative>. And then through the introduction of, unique styles of music, as well as an interaction with some unique people, that it ends up, it ends up guiding you away from what you thought or not away, but at least parallel to what you originally thought you were going to do. Yeah. I, you know, I know a lot of people that, that really are dedicated to sort of like dots on paper composition. Right? <span style="color:red" data-ts="1517.56" data-end_ts="1517.72" title="1517.56" id=c_"1517.56">__Yeah__</span>. And it's really hard. It's hard to imagine some of, some of these people saying, you know, what I'm becoming entranced with, I'm becoming entrance with alternate tunings, which is leading me to alternate instrument makeup, which is making me want to make sculptural instruments. I mean, it's, it seems like a very interesting, but very unique kind of, kind of direction to go now, to what extent do you think, so you talk about having Doug Rapo and Brad <span style="color:red" data-ts="1553.71" data-end_ts="1554" title="1553.71" id=c_"1553.71">__Gart__</span> as people that you worked with at Columbia, to what extent did they sort of like help activate that desire in you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Or was it, or is it something else? I mean, did you, as, as a kid were like, you work in a garage with dad making stuff in the shop, or, I mean, did you already have this desire to build things or was it really activated by the people you were around and, and the interests that you had? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>It's kind of an interaction between those two? So I come from, so growing up in Minnesota, my mom is a Potter. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>She's also like a science and math high school teacher, but, but she also, she made pottery and was a craft person too. Neither of my parents are musicians, but, and then my dad is an electrical engineer. So he's like, and I remem, you know, my parents tell all these stories about me being really interested in like building and inventing or, you know, okay. Their favorite story is that I was going to going to kindergarten or something to drop me off. And then the teachers were like, oh, we're so glad Jeff's gonna be here today. Cuz this chair broke, you know, there needed me to help fix the chair or <span style="color:red" data-ts="1630.56" data-end_ts="1630.76" title="1630.56" id=c_"1630.56">__stuff__</span>. Right. <laugh> so it's like, <laugh> so, I mean, I, I have a lot of memories of being, I've always been very interested in sort of how things work and things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Right, right. But I think a little bit like, at some point I decided that, I was less interested in that kind of thing. I think, you know, my dad had this, corporate engineering job working for like, you know, aerospace industry things. Right. And it just seemed so boring to me sure. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1659.08" data-end_ts="1659.24" title="1659.08" id=c_"1659.08">__That__</span> it seemed like, seemed like he spent a lot of his time doing these things that, you know, were a lot of bureaucracy and you know, it didn't seem like a fun job. Right. So right. In a way I think, and I think he he's, he enjoyed his work in a lot of ways, but, I, I think I, when I got to college, I was kinda like, I'm not gonna do that. I'm gonna, I'm gonna be a musician. It's gonna be really fun, you know? And, and in some ways I kind of shut myself off to thinking about that side of my personality, and being open to it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Okay. And I didn't really take engineering classes or anything. I mean I went there thinking I was maybe gonna do something in science, but then I, I kind of strayed pretty fast. Right. So the whole making things, part of my personality was more channeled towards creative things of art and music. And it wasn't until I got to grad school that I kind of realized how much I enjoyed that other side of my personality and how much I missed it when I started being encouraged to get that, that side of creation happening again. Right. The thing I remember most about, and, and part of it is, well, Doug Roberto's influence on me, I think is a lot, was primarily kind of teaching me how accessible it is. So I think there's for technology, there's a bit of a challenge in engineering. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>There's, there's, there's a challenge to, to get into it because there's a lot of things are sort of overly complicated. See <span style="color:red" data-ts="1756.94" data-end_ts="1757.14" title="1756.94" id=c_"1756.94">__me__</span>, you know, there's, there's a lot of, kind of, oh, you wanna get into this thing? Well, you're gonna have to know blank and blank and blank and blank. Right. And, and there's a lot of kind of, oh, well you should be a train such and such in order to do this or whatever. And I feel like Doug Rapo has this, approach to that, which is just the opposite of kind of, no, everybody can do this. You know, you just need to learn what you need to, to learn and figure out what you need to get to get past your current problem. You know? And it's like, he's got this really open mindset about it. He runs this thing called dork Pott in New York city. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Right. Which now is spread all over the world. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1794.42" data-end_ts="1794.64" title="1794.42" id=c_"1794.42">__Yep__</span>. There's like dork, Pott, Dublin and dork, Pott, whatever. But, and I started going to those in New York city. And there are these meetings of people, people using art and technology and the, the subheading for Dorkbot is people doing strange things with electricity. <laugh> and it's very open in the sense that it's just anybody doing anything that is strange with electricity can present and he doesn't curate. So it's just like, if you say yes, I wanna present something then he's like, okay, what time? You know, or right. Oh, here's when the next slide is free. He does curate a little bit, which, which people are grouped together. So it's always a group of three people presenting. Okay. And I'm very inspired by like how well he sets this up. So it's like, so he kind of chooses people to present together in a way to kind of make sure that there's, there's a level of quality in the presentations and then also like some contrast and stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>And it, it really is like, it ends up being this bizarre connection between like somebody doing some really fine art, you know, I'm presenting this at this gallery, blah, blah, blah. And then somebody who's like, I'm grandpa <span style="color:red" data-ts="1866.44" data-end_ts="1866.66" title="1866.44" id=c_"1866.44">__in__</span> the basement and I made a light bulb pad or something, you know, and that's just like, <laugh>, it's, it's amazing. The diversity that ends up showing up at these things. And then one of the rules is it's it's you have to show work in progress. Right. So, and it, it shouldn't be like this art artist talk here's my slides. Yeah. You know, I'm so great. It's like, here's, it's total geek <span style="color:red" data-ts="1886.74" data-end_ts="1887.02" title="1886.74" id=c_"1886.74">__thumb__</span>. Yeah. Yeah. It's like, here's this thing I'm working on. And here's what I don't understand. And here's why, you know, and here's where I, the decisions I haven't make yet. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="1894.5" data-end_ts="1894.9" title="1894.5" id=c_"1894.5">__anybody__</span> got any ideas, you know, and it's like seeing the inside of the process was very inspiring to me to be able to go to these kind of things and be like, and I also, I, I got to present every year. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>I presented something at dork <span style="color:red" data-ts="1905.86" data-end_ts="1906.02" title="1905.86" id=c_"1905.86">__pot__</span> and it's like, kind of let me get into that scene and, and get a lot of ideas from other people and kind of pushed me to get projects to presentable state that I was working on and stuff. So, so that was really important to me. Sure. And then, from Brad <span style="color:red" data-ts="1922.46" data-end_ts="1922.74" title="1922.46" id=c_"1922.46">__garden__</span>, I think kind of the most important advice anybody gave me, came from Brad <span style="color:red" data-ts="1928.9" data-end_ts="1929.14" title="1928.9" id=c_"1928.9">__garden__</span> at one point where probably three years into my doctoral degree, I was sitting there writing a lot of acoustic music, you know, spending time writing pieces for whatever drink, quart <span style="color:red" data-ts="1949.03" data-end_ts="1949.11" title="1949.03" id=c_"1949.03">__tests__</span> and stuff. And then, and meeting with Brad about software, I was trying to write and things like that. And then I was like, and I was like, yeah. And I think I'm doing this and this and this and whatnot. And then he is like, you know, when you applied here, you had that picture of that crazy instrument you built <laugh>, he's like, I thought you were gonna come here and build instruments and do crazy stuff like that. What happened? <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Where, where did you go wrong with 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Theses? Right. I was like, I was like, I can do that. You know, nobody told me that was okay. You know, and, basically, and, and I mean that, I don't think he has any idea how important that was for me, but it was like somebody giving me the permission to do that as an acceptable way to my doctorate was just amazing. So, and it was like, I thought about it and I was like, yeah, that's exactly what I wanna do. Like, that's, that's what I wanna be doing. So with his blessing, I kind of changed my, changed my <span style="color:red" data-ts="2009.22" data-end_ts="2009.38" title="2009.22" id=c_"2009.22">__core__</span>, my focus, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I think it's really interesting that, that <span style="color:red" data-ts="2012.96" data-end_ts="2013.18" title="2012.96" id=c_"2012.96">__you__</span> are, that you kind of, had all of this stuff happened kind of right. At the bridging point of a lot of intersections of stuff. So this, you know, for you, this started happening, about the time that the internet really started becoming information rich, you know? Yes. The 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>First, exactly 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The first half decade, it was more like we, we can do stuff. Right. And then all of a sudden, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Mm-hmm <affirmative> I was websites, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2049.54" data-end_ts="2049.66" title="2049.54" id=c_"2049.54">__I__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2049.66" data-end_ts="2049.74" title="2049.66" id=c_"2049.66">__check__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2049.74" data-end_ts="2049.9" title="2049.74" id=c_"2049.74">__out__</span> my rotating skull <span style="color:red" data-ts="2051.14" data-end_ts="2051.38" title="2051.14" id=c_"2051.14">__gift__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right, right. But then, you know, people started putting together, like here's the DIY guitar pedal site. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. And here is the mail list for all the people that are in analog <span style="color:red" data-ts="2063.58" data-end_ts="2063.82" title="2063.58" id=c_"2063.58">__since__</span> or whatever. Yeah. You started seeing these kind of micro communities come together with a really strong focus towards particularly towards DIY work. Yeah. And, and a lot of what you were doing was just on the front, on the very front edge of that. So it seemed like as it was coming online, you were kind of like gulping it all up and kind of reformulating it into your own thing. What's the, what is the Genesis of the manta, interface, because it's, it's pretty unique in that it's, first of all, I have to say, you know, I, I have one, you were, kind enough to let me, let me use one. And it's still an instrument that I use a lot. It's I find it really unique because it's one of the few control surfaces that you can approach in a lot of different ways. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It has a very touch. And, so I find myself a lot of times doing things where I'll either create some kind of mechanism by which I'm sort of like strumming the buttons or where I'm doing really fast finger tap, finger, drumming style stuff. It's a really, it's a really unique interface. And, but it also seems like the level of complexity to get it to that point and to really tweak it, to be that sensitive must have been crazy difficult. What is, what is the Genesis of that particular instrument beside the, the shape of the buttons? Mm-hmm, <affirmative>, there's, there's a lot there and what are some of the decisions you made and what are some of the things you had to learn to get to that point? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Yeah. Interesting question. So let me think back, can I, my mind back, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Cast your mind back to that Soviet manta that 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>You exactly <laugh>? Well, I think interestingly, I, I got really interested in capacitive sensing through the Bula touch controller because there's a touch controller in the Bula 100 system that I just loved, that I was like, this is kind of the best way to interact with electronic music that I can imagine. Mm-hmm <affirmative> when I first played with it. And that one uses capacity <span style="color:red" data-ts="2205.44" data-end_ts="2205.6" title="2205.44" id=c_"2205.44">__of__</span> touch sensing. So it has the same kind of, you know, contact itself is the, is the, instigator and you don't have to use pressure or anything. And, but it was also sort of a strip of eight sensors, or I can't remember, I think like eight sensors, so that were these little rectangular things, and it didn't really feel like layout wise, like it was very expressive. So then I said, okay, I wanna do something with like more sensors. That's capacitive touch, sensing that connects to my computer. Those were kind of my goals so that I could use it with max <span style="color:red" data-ts="2240.1" data-end_ts="2240.32" title="2240.1" id=c_"2240.1">__MSP__</span> and other things that I was doing. Okay. And then I started looking into how to do capacity sensing and utilizing that wealth of DIY knowledge on the internet. I learned some techniques that I was trying out. So, and I also, I started, I got the old <span style="color:red" data-ts="2260.8" data-end_ts="2261.12" title="2260.8" id=c_"2260.8">__electro__</span> notes stuff. Are you, you know, those 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Bernie Hutchins work. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Exactly. So beautiful kind of, kind of, yeah, like this pre-internet, mostly like seventies and eighties or when did it start? I'm not sure, but, I don't know, sort of newsletter yeah. For, for electronic circum <span style="color:red" data-ts="2278.98" data-end_ts="2279.4" title="2278.98" id=c_"2278.98">__design__</span>. And I got those and read through a lot of those to try to understand things. And, and I was kind of implementing these, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2287.36" data-end_ts="2287.48" title="2287.36" id=c_"2287.36">__capacity__</span> sensing designs, but really looking at it being a kind of complicated device with a lot of components inside. Okay. To do multiple sensors the way I wanted to. And then, Cypress, this manufacturer of, of chips came out with the, with a chip that had kind of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2310.28" data-end_ts="2310.4" title="2310.28" id=c_"2310.28">__capacity__</span> sensing built in integrated into it. So I believe they were the brand that was making the chip for the first iPod. Oh, okay. Right. So this is like around the time the iPod had come out, like around the time that I started doing interest in this, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You're talking about the iPod touch or 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Yeah, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2325.54" data-end_ts="2325.76" title="2325.54" id=c_"2325.54">__no__</span>, I think the original iPod, like the scroll 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2327.64" data-end_ts="2327.76" title="2327.64" id=c_"2327.64">__A__</span> little stro wheel. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Okay. Yeah, exactly. So like suddenly, and the iPod basically made <span style="color:red" data-ts="2334.8" data-end_ts="2334.88" title="2334.8" id=c_"2334.8">__capacity__</span> sensing come back into technological world in a way, right. Where until then there had been kind of like touchscreens, but they were usually resistive, which is a much more, tends to be a lot clumsier technology. Right. And suddenly these kind of chip manufacturers that were making micro controllers were interested in trying to make simple implementations of Capac touch, sensing that were integrated onto one little chip. Right. Okay. So this basically solved my problem for me, where I was like, oh, I'm gonna use this. So then, so then I figured out how to, how to use these, these chips and I'm, and I ended up kind of I'm, I'm mostly using their library, for doing the touch sensing inside it. And, and then it was just a matter of, of working to kind of figure out, you know, iterating through designs and trying to figure out okay, the, the thing is all of those, all of those commercial solutions of these kind of chips that are implementing <span style="color:red" data-ts="2396.15" data-end_ts="2396.31" title="2396.15" id=c_"2396.15">__to__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2396.31" data-end_ts="2396.47" title="2396.31" id=c_"2396.31">__let__</span> touch sensing, they really like in a way they're solving my problem, cuz they want to be able to have a lot of touch sensors in a small space. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>But they also are always for a different purpose. Right. They want, they want you to just know that something's touched or not. And that's like <span style="color:red" data-ts="2413.51" data-end_ts="2413.67" title="2413.51" id=c_"2413.51">__the__</span> right. Or like what location is touched is still sort of all that the iPhone gives you or anything. Right. Right. So, and I wanted this thing that I saw in the Booklo, which was give me the value of the capacitance that you're adding to it. So, which they do the, the, the sensing thing technology gives you, but it's not as broken out as easily or, you know, there's, it's not always, it's not really designed for that. So I ended up, I read a lot on kind of design of touch sensor buttons, and then tried things out. And I realized that I actually had to do things that were counter to those examples in order to get what I wanted, which was this more continuous kind of, capacitance measurement as the thing that ends up coming out of it rather than just something that you <span style="color:red" data-ts="2459.87" data-end_ts="2460.03" title="2459.87" id=c_"2459.87">__then__</span> threshold in order to get a button. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>So that was kind of, that was a lot of the time was spent on, on getting that to feel right. And getting, getting sort of the touch to be at the right, at the right point and then get the, get the line to move up smoothly as you, as you <span style="color:red" data-ts="2477.75" data-end_ts="2477.99" title="2477.75" id=c_"2477.75">__push__</span> down your finger. Right. And then I think, the part of the, probably the biggest jump after that, after just kind of moving away around a bunch of different designs that way was, when I decided to put LEDs on, on it. So it wasn't until the very final prototype that there were LEDs. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Really? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Okay. Yeah. So all of the original, all the initial ones, it was intended to just be like input, right. Touch input. But, and this was probably, this was particularly inspired by the mono, which was, this is right around the time the mono came out too, that I was developing stuff. Okay. And, and the mono is, by, by, Brian, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Brian Crabtree. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Yeah. Brian Crabtree and Kelly Kane mm-hmm <affirmative> and, just fantastic instrument. Yeah. Great, great controller. And, and they had this, L E D feedback thing that was controllable from the computer, which gave it so much power compared to, now, you know, that's everywhere now there's like a million copies of this. Right. But at the time when the mono came out, nobody else was really doing good controllers with L E D feedback that way. Right. So I found that really inspiring and I said, oh yeah, I really want the lights on this thing. You know, I really want these sensors to also have some information coming back. Right. And I noticed that without any physical feedback of, you're not, you don't feel the button get touched. It would be nice to have a light light up sometimes if, as a default kind of behavior, get a little visual feedback since there's no tactile feedback outside of your contact with the button. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>So then I had to work on kind of how to do that. And the idea I had was to put these LEDs facing down to do this kind of back lighting thing. Okay. But the weird thing about the, the manta is that, which I haven't really seen anybody else really try to do is that I'm, I'm trying to do back lighting through a printed circuit board. Right. So the panel itself is just a circuit board mm-hmm <affirmative> and then I've got LEDs mounted to the bottom of it facing down, and then I've got routed cavities inside the case that act as reflective that are like painted in white primer that then like reflect the light back up. And then 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>It's just going through the circuit board, which is actually, there's only one circuit board, which is the panel. All the tips are on the back of it. The L <span style="color:red" data-ts="2622.8" data-end_ts="2622.88" title="2622.8" id=c_"2622.8">__E__</span> D feedback comes, comes back through that same circuit board. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's very interesting. I, I had wonder because the LEDs on that have a very peculiar glow to 'em and I was like, you know, it's unlike everything else I have, which kind of like bursts light into your face. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2640.7" data-end_ts="2640.92" title="2640.7" id=c_"2640.7">__Ah__</span>, that's interesting. That, that makes sense. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Yeah. And I, I experiment a little bit and I found that and I was just like, ah, this looks really good. I love that. So then that's how I designed it, which ended up kind of it's, it's kind of a terrible design as far as design for manufacturing. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Probably so. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Right. Because that means that I'm limited to using laminates that have good optical translucency and don't have ugly colors. Right. So laminates meaning the material of the, of the, the fiberglass material that circuit <span style="color:red" data-ts="2669.88" data-end_ts="2670.08" title="2669.88" id=c_"2669.88">__board__</span> made <span style="color:red" data-ts="2670.28" data-end_ts="2670.44" title="2670.28" id=c_"2670.28">__out__</span>. And it, of course, in fabricating, like in the industrial world of circuit board fabrication, nobody cares about that at all. Right. So, right. There's not even a way to find out if the manufacturer that you're going through uses some kind of laminate that is gonna look good when an <span style="color:red" data-ts="2687.2" data-end_ts="2687.4" title="2687.2" id=c_"2687.2">__LA__</span> D shines through it. Right. And they don't, they don't know how to test and they, you know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>They don't even know how to talk to you about it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Right. Exactly. So I'm, I'm like, so here's what I need, you know, but, and they're like, yeah, why do you need this? I'm sorry. You know, <laugh> right. So I ended up having to like find this, you know, contacting all these laminate suppliers, and then it's, it's, I'm kind of like going with this special laminate, that's actually, you know, most of them are, are treated with, most PCB lams today are, are treated with a, a dye so that it fluoresces under UV light so that, it's easier to check it when you're soldering it. Sure. So you can find a open <span style="color:red" data-ts="2726.72" data-end_ts="2726.96" title="2726.72" id=c_"2726.72">__office__</span> for 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>A few ways, right? Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Exactly. So, but I'm like I'm using a laminate that doesn't have that dye so that the L E D shining through, so it doesn't have that ugly green tent to it. Ah, but anyway, but that means that my manufacturing is more expensive than it could be otherwise. For sure. So, but I, I sort of can't think of any other way that I would get that effect and I like it so 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's kind of interesting though, practically everyone I talk about that's doing, doing any kind of significant musical instrument creation of any sort has that same complaint, which is, which is, well in order to do it right. I have to have custom work done. And yeah. So my manufacturing is more expensive than what I guess, a cell phone or something. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Yeah, exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But also you're kind of like making 10 at a time or whatever. So it's, that's gonna be a lot more expensive as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Yeah. The economy is scale. When I started, you know, thinking about this as actually making something that other people would be able to buy. Right. It's amazing how much, you know, I always imagine that that affected things like, okay, quantity, you know, things go down in quantity, but it's like, it's, it's a steep curve. Right. It's like, <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The difference between 10 and a hundred is huge between a hundred and a thousand is like mind numbing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Exactly. It's like, basically the person who's making a thousand is making <span style="color:red" data-ts="2803.48" data-end_ts="2803.68" title="2803.48" id=c_"2803.48">__it__</span> for almost the same price that I'm making a hundred, you know, or, and then, you know, it's like, all those components just become pennies. Right. As soon as, as soon as you're making millions like apple. Yeah. So it's like, yeah, I, I could maybe make an iPhone for you, but it would cost you a million dollars, you know, <laugh> right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Unless I make a million of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2820.24" data-end_ts="2820.4" title="2820.24" id=c_"2820.24">__them__</span> at 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Which exactly cost $1. Exactly. Yeah. So it's kind of ridiculous. Yeah. But, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, I, man, the time is we're burning through the time here already, but one of the things I want to ask you is to talk to me and my listeners about how we could take a journey. So obviously things are a little different now than when you started mm-hmm <affirmative> but you mentioned some books, like the physical computing book <span style="color:red" data-ts="2849.96" data-end_ts="2850.24" title="2849.96" id=c_"2849.96">__yeah__</span>. Or the, the circuit bending book by Collins. Yeah. But, if, if, if you, you know, if the 18 year old version of yourself walked through the door and was like, Hey, help me learn how to make the instruments. Yeah. What, where would you start them off? What is the path that you would set them upon? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Yeah. Hmm. Good question. I'd have to think for a sec. I mean, one thing is I would recommend those two books that I, that I mentioned mm-hmm, <affirmative> the physical computing one. I kind of wish that they came out with another addition of it because it's, it was written at the time that before do we know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>So, and I, I'm not aware, I, I don't think they've come out with a new addition of that. So it, it talks about things in terms of the basic stamp, as the example, which is an older technology. That's not as, not as, user friendly, I don't think, but, that's how I learned, but nowadays I would learn it on our <span style="color:red" data-ts="2911.41" data-end_ts="2911.63" title="2911.41" id=c_"2911.41">__doo__</span> mm-hmm <affirmative>, but you could buy that book and then you could just translate all those examples into our <span style="color:red" data-ts="2916.13" data-end_ts="2916.35" title="2916.13" id=c_"2916.13">__doo__</span> very easily. Sure. It would not be, it would not be a hard way to start. And the other thing is, yeah, I mean, I would say Arduino is the way to go, like pick that up, go through the tutorials. Online, tons of people have done amazing little projects and they're all aimed at people who are not engineers by training. So it's like, or, you know, if you're an engineer by training, you have a little advantage, but it still assumes, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2940.81" data-end_ts="2941.03" title="2940.81" id=c_"2940.81">__it__</span>, it's still really interesting. And if you're not an engineer, then it it's made for you and you, you know, you can follow along and you can figure it out.  for the hardware electronic side. Yeah. Do our doo stuff read through Nick Collins book. His thing is, is less focused on things like Arduino and micro. Controller's a little more focused on just straight up, analog hardware using 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Lot. Yeah. Timer, chips and stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Yeah, exactly. Which is a really, I think gets you kind of, you know, gets you a little bit, one level lower and kind of into, into the guts of electronics and kind of in a really playful way too. Right. Where, where unlike, you know, where it's not like here's this thing. And then at the end you can make a microwave, you know, it's like, yeah. I mean, really the thing is if you're doing electrical stuff, electricity can be pretty unintuitive and scary in some ways. But really like if you're doing stuff based off a nine volt battery, instead of plugging into the wall, you can kind of do whatever you want. <laugh> and you're not gonna hurt yourself. You might blow out a chip, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3001.26" data-end_ts="3001.55" title="3001.26" id=c_"3001.26">__they__</span> cost 10 cents, you know, I mean, right. Just mess around, you know, and like, and his, his book kind of is a great way to get involved in that kind of thing. And yeah, it didn't exist when I was learning this stuff. And if I was learning it now, I would, I would love to love to go 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Through that. Totally embrace <span style="color:red" data-ts="3016.25" data-end_ts="3016.47" title="3016.25" id=c_"3016.25">__it__</span>. Yeah. All right. So I have another question that I'm just very curious about mm-hmm <affirmative> how much, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Oh, wait, can I interrupt <span style="color:red" data-ts="3023.75" data-end_ts="3023.87" title="3023.75" id=c_"3023.75">__to__</span> say one more? Oh yeah. On that. So the other, the other side of this, I wanna build instruments, like electronics, isn't the only side of it, right? Oh, of course. So if you wanna learn how to do some acoustic instruments, which I think is very valuable, as well, like even if you wanna make electronic instruments and not acoustic instruments, mm-hmm <affirmative>, I think it's really interesting to learn how to make simple acoustic instruments and learn how that works right. As an inspiration. Right. And Bart Hopkins is the guy for that. So he ran this journal called experimental musical instruments for a long time. Which is defunct now, but he has these, you can buy the old issues yeah. From his website. And, they're amazing. So I've read all of those and they're, they're just super, super inspiring to find out kind of what people have done and what ideas people have had. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>And, and that also is another thing kind of like Doug Roberto's Dorkbot thing, where it just mixes high and low and fancy and, and crude. And, you know, somebody's like, Hey, I, I took some tin cans and put 'em on a grocery cart and it sounded cool. And then somebody else is like, you know, oh, I built this, you know, super complicated system. It got installed at the museum of modern art or <span style="color:red" data-ts="3090.88" data-end_ts="3090.96" title="3090.88" id=c_"3090.88">__what__</span>, you know, I mean, it's just like this, you know, and, and then, oh, check it out. You can make yourself a wooden flu out of a straw, you know, <laugh>, it's just really interesting. And then he also has a book called experimental or what is it called? I think it's called, oh, I can't remember. It might be called. No, I don't remember. But look up Bart Hopkins book about building your own musical instruments. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I'll have to do that. Cuz that one's, that's one I'm not, I'm not, that's great, aware of and I'm supposed to be so 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b><laugh> yeah. It's it's and it walks you through, like, you can, you can use it, you know, for one thing, it's an overview of all these different systems for like, okay, how can, how can a string connect to a body of <span style="color:red" data-ts="3130.49" data-end_ts="3130.61" title="3130.49" id=c_"3130.49">__an__</span> instrument or right. You know, it, it kind of introduces you to all these or what is a what's happening in a brass mouthpiece, but then also it's got these little projects where you can be like, I'm gonna build myself a thumpy. Okay. And then like, okay, here's what you need. Here's the steps do it, you know? It's, it's really great way to learn. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3148.19" data-end_ts="3148.41" title="3148.19" id=c_"3148.19">__Oh__</span>, awesome. So I just wanted to mention that too. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So I have a question that I, that I, really want to throw at you because especially given your background, given, given where you're going, how much music do you still do? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>I do a ton of music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>All right. Well, that's good news because one of the things I have to say is that sometimes when I talk to people who are musicians that move into instrument building yeah. What ends up happening is they get so focused on the instrument, building that all of a sudden they look up and a decade's gone by and they haven't done any music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Yeah. And I would say, be careful not to do that to <laugh> that 18 year old me showing up, like I definitely get distracted and wanna want to create. I spent the last two weeks, I just got back from a residency, an artist residency <span style="color:red" data-ts="3198.39" data-end_ts="3198.55" title="3198.39" id=c_"3198.39">__at__</span>, in Maine at this place called haystack soul of crafts. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>And it was so much fun, but there I did absolutely no music. So for two weeks I was just doing woodworking and like doing instrument, building stuff. And that was great. But yeah, like now I'm back. I'm gonna be, you know, playing again. I, one thing that's been pretty exciting to me lately is I've gotten, I've started to kinda work my improvisation career a lot more. Okay. And I, this year I did a lot more composition than I have in the last year. I didn't write too many pieces and I was a little down about that. So this year I wrote a piece for string quartet and pedal steel guitar really beautiful, really got played fantastically with, Susan Alcorn. Who's a fantastic pedal, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3246.33" data-end_ts="3246.68" title="3246.33" id=c_"3246.33">__still__</span> guitar player, who is like the, one of the only people who plays pedal <span style="color:red" data-ts="3250.84" data-end_ts="3251.08" title="3250.84" id=c_"3250.84">__still__</span> guitar, that sort of country, Western classical instrument. Right. You know, classic country, Western instrument, and can play it in an experimental context and can, you know, read music and do all this crazy stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I would think that would be actually a, a fantastic instrument for that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Oh my God. It's so cool. <laugh> I don't think anybody's, there's, there's one other piece by a guy that was played with the Nashville symphony orchestra for the pedal steel guitar and orchestra. But, as, outside of that example, I don't know, I don't know of anybody else. Who's used it in this context, but it's so perfect. So I wrote that I wrote a piece for brass ensemble and electronics with <span style="color:red" data-ts="3286.78" data-end_ts="3287" title="3286.78" id=c_"3286.78">__San__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3287.11" data-end_ts="3287.4" title="3287.11" id=c_"3287.11">__Luda__</span>, who plays the manta. And then I played my JD one synthesizer thing, right. That I built, yeah so I got to write a lot of pieces this, this year, but I also have been doing kind of a bunch of improvisation and, I don't know, there's something about that just makes me feel so good. Like, partially it's, it's a, it's an awesome contrast from the really logical work of instrument building. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Right. And the very careful work of composition where like you're sitting down and you're composing and you're writing notes on paper. You're kinda like you didn't spend an hour on like five seconds. Right. You know, and you're like, I don't know, should this note have any flat or should it be a D <laugh>? No. And then you're like, you know, there's really no answer. It's just like, kind of, you just kind of say, okay, well, I guess I'm doing that. But then maybe this puts me in a different position later, you know, who knows what? Right. Right. But, and then with the technology, you've got a different situation where it's like, there is a right answer to some degree where, except for the more design aesthetic choices, there's like, I need this to function this way. Test, test, test, test, change, test, test, test. It works done. Mm-hmm <affirmative>, you know, so it's like basically, you know, that's really satisfying in, in a certain way. Right. But I find, I've been really happy doing kind of focusing in the last few years on, on doing these improvisation gigs in New York. Mm-hmm <affirmative> where kind of getting back to the, in <span style="color:red" data-ts="3370.95" data-end_ts="3371.03" title="3370.95" id=c_"3370.95">__involved__</span> your 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Original influences 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Exactly. The scene that I was loving in high school of listening to all the za recordings from John's label and, you know right. All those people, which, yeah, it's, I'm still just fascinated by that music. And I love the idea of improv, improvising live together with other people in this free context where, you know, anything can happen. And it's like, that's just been very, very exciting for me to focus on that a bit. And I'm playing an instrument that I built, which is fun. But, one of the cool things about that for me, for my instrument building sides is, I built something maybe maybe three years ago now, this, the JD one thing, which was a custom job for a guy, that I'm made one for myself as well. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3420.95" data-end_ts="3421.24" title="3420.95" id=c_"3420.95">__Okay__</span>. And it's been my, my main instrument since then, so, oh, really? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>It's like since then I've been practicing on it and playing out on it as, as the thing I play. And, that's really exciting for me as an instrument builder to really be able to dive really deeply into something that I built and know kind of like everything about how I feel about its layout and, and how it functions and, you know, yeah, really kind of put it through its paces personally, as opposed to like making something and then giving it to somebody and hearing them do something with it, but not really getting the same internal feedback. Sure. So that's been cool. And, and I'm also playing in these sort of jazz context lately where playing this quarte with a drummer named Federica UGI, playing his material. And that's just the weirdest thing ever for me. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3469.02" data-end_ts="3469.26" title="3469.02" id=c_"3469.02">__It's__</span>, <laugh>, it's pretty awesome. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>I don't have any jazz training. Like, I mean, I, I played a little, I tried to learn some jazz guitar in high school and stuff and played in like Allstate jazz band. But I think they were a little disappointed when they got me in that, you know, <laugh> and they found out that I can't really solo, but, back in the day, but, this thing has just been a really interesting situation where they it's a quartet with drums, trumpet, saxophone, and it used to be a bass player. And then the bass player left and Fedco said, Hey, you wanna join us on your synthesizer? So I'm basically the bass player for the awesome, but I, my weird touch controller, analog synthesizer rig, oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>That's crazy. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>He's, he's open with me doing whatever I want. Like I don't always have to be the bass, you know? Right, right. So, and he's just this fed amazing musician, he's studied with or Coleman and stuff. And he's just like got this. And his, his music actually shows a lot of that influence this kind of folk music melodies, but then a very sort of complex free underpinning right underneath it. And then, and that's just been like this wonderful experience for me to kind of stretch into those roles where I, I really wish that I sort of knew how to walk a baseline or something every now and then, but right. <laugh> or that I knew how to play a keyboard since I've, I'm playing kind of an instrument that has a keyboard on it, but right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3554.2" data-end_ts="3554.42" title="3554.2" id=c_"3554.2">__But__</span>, but it's been just a really exciting growing experience to go from thinking very timely where most of my, my improvisation until then had been kind of in this noise genre, I have a duo with Sam Plato called exclusive <span style="color:red" data-ts="3569.4" data-end_ts="3569.56" title="3569.4" id=c_"3569.4">__or__</span> that we it's, it's more about sound. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>And, it's pretty interesting to be plunged into a context where that's okay, but there's a lot of, a lot of room to think about line, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. There's there's note requirements. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Yeah. Right. And I mean, he, and he has scores and it's like, and he's okay if I, if I don't totally do that, but it's like, you know, there's no baseline written it's very, or <span style="color:red" data-ts="3595.16" data-end_ts="3595.36" title="3595.16" id=c_"3595.16">__net__</span> Coleman mm-hmm, <affirmative>, influenced like, harm <span style="color:red" data-ts="3598.19" data-end_ts="3598.48" title="3598.19" id=c_"3598.19">__lots__</span> where there's no <span style="color:red" data-ts="3599.32" data-end_ts="3599.52" title="3599.32" id=c_"3599.32">__core__</span> changes or whatever. So it's like, so yeah, it's open. I can do whatever I want, but it sounds really good if I, if I think about it as a, as a melody, you know? Right. And that's been really great for me as a musician just to like push myself in that direction. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that's great. Well, I'm just so glad to hear that you're not only, not only continue to do music, but you know, actually kind of embracing, pushing yourself as well. Because again, I, I see so often where people get into the technology and forget about the music. I mean, it's, it's like, like in so many other areas, the technology can be such a siren song. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Yeah. It it's seductive. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. It 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Is so much time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>There's that too? Excellent. All right. Well, we're, we're getting to the end here. What I, why don't you tell me what's next for you as a builder, particularly a builder that might make something that I could get my hands on. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Yeah. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The mantis are still available, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Mantas are still available. I'm running low on stock. So I think I'm, I only have a few more of the, the second generation, which is the latest one. Right. I may make more, I'm trying to decide I don't right now have the dough to make more so mm-hmm <affirmative> I have to think about it, but, the, the next big project is this summer, I'm working on a wind instrument. So I made like a really early prototype of this wind instrument back in 2008. And, and it kind of pointed out these, a lot of limitations of that particular instrument when I started writing for it. And this is my kind of revision to that where I'm trying to do just like a, a quick kind of description of what the goal is. So, you know, there are these commercial, electronic wind controllers, there's, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The UE 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>And the UE from a <span style="color:red" data-ts="3713.23" data-end_ts="3713.43" title="3713.23" id=c_"3713.23">__Kai__</span>, which is originally designed by Nile Steiner. Who's one of my heroes as a designer too. He's really excellent. And then there's, I also, I like AKA as a brand, they do good stuff. And then there's the Yamaha w X series. Right. And those both have been kind of in continuous production for many, many years. Right. Going through a few different design changes. And then there's a few kind of more boutique controllers, that involve wind in instru wind input, or there's like a, the digital Morris and digital trumpet, things like that. I think the, I, you know, the Igon <span style="color:red" data-ts="3749.32" data-end_ts="3749.6" title="3749.32" id=c_"3749.32">__higher__</span> has like a <span style="color:red" data-ts="3750.16" data-end_ts="3750.28" title="3750.16" id=c_"3750.16">__breath__</span> sensor thing on it. Right, right. So there's a bit of a, of a tradition there in the commercial world. One thing that things don't really do is, both the UE and the, and the w X series one S which are kind of the main commercial competitors here, they, they have digital <span style="color:red" data-ts="3768.02" data-end_ts="3768.24" title="3768.02" id=c_"3768.02">__and__</span> off buttons basically. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Right. So it's kind of like looking at a pattern of fingerings and then saying, okay, what note <span style="color:red" data-ts="3774.76" data-end_ts="3774.88" title="3774.76" id=c_"3774.76">__are__</span>, you're trying to play based on the zeros and ones that it senses along the length of the instrument, from what keys you pressed. Right. And then it's saying, okay, this is, you've put down this finger and this finger, and not that finger, this must be an EFL. Right. Mm-hmm <affirmative>, and then it's making that into a Midy note. Right. And then it's combining that with breath sensor input, which is just sensing kind of pressure and routing that to amplitude usually. And I think both of them actually have a, some kind of bite sensor as well. So there's sort of like on, your mouth, you can also bite down <span style="color:red" data-ts="3808.2" data-end_ts="3808.36" title="3808.2" id=c_"3808.2">__on__</span> a pressure sensor and add an additional parameter, but I feel like those, I'm not actually a wind instrument player, but I'm pretty interested in kind of how wind instruments work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>It seems like there's a lot more to wind instrument than just those things, right. Pitch amplitude, and one additional synthesis parameter, right. On certain, you know, depending on the wind instrument on, on certain wind instruments, there's for instance, like open <span style="color:red" data-ts="3831.2" data-end_ts="3831.4" title="3831.2" id=c_"3831.2">__hold__</span> flutes, or you look at like an Indian, Indian flute, or that Golon suing flute that Greg Taylor played in, in the Indonesian orchestra played in, where you can bend the pitches by moving your fingers up and down. Mm-hmm, <affirmative> like, by subtly, you know, moving your pinky on, onto the hole and like just covering it, just barely covering. Right. Exactly. Things like that are the way that you get sort of expressive shadings in those instruments. And, I find that really interesting and it's kind of like completely lost in the, the current commercial ones. Although they, they often have some way to bend, you know, like a thumb, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Some really thing. Right, exactly. But I'm kind of interested in trying to think about what would it mean to make like an open hold, essentially, an open hold, electronic wind instrument <laugh> and then, and the other side of it that I think needs more work is the, is the mouth sensing, I'm trying to implement Amish. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3887.94" data-end_ts="3888.06" title="3887.94" id=c_"3887.94">__Sure__</span>. Sensing that's more complicated, you know, more complex and understands better. What's up with your mouth. Right. Than simply like how hard are you're blowing and, did you bite it or not, you know, or are you biting it? So like, the current version of what I'm working on is kind of trying to combine those two things. And it's actually a really hard problem when you get into the continuous sensing on the holes of the keys of a win instrument, because you can't do this look <span style="color:red" data-ts="3913.26" data-end_ts="3913.42" title="3913.26" id=c_"3913.26">__up__</span> table implementation that you can, but if they're buttons, right. So with, with the buttons, you can just look at it and say, okay, that's a one, that's a zero. That's a one, that's a zero, that's a zero. Okay. This is, this is mid note, 60, right. With when they're all continuous. Now you have like, you have a bunch of values that go from zero to a thousand and you've got like 10 of 'em or something. Right. So it's like, what does that even mean? What a certain pattern of that is really hard to match. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>So I'm experimenting a little bit with doing like tone <span style="color:red" data-ts="3943.6" data-end_ts="3943.84" title="3943.6" id=c_"3943.6">__hole__</span> modeling. The thing that's been most successful so far is I'm actually doing neural <span style="color:red" data-ts="3948.5" data-end_ts="3948.72" title="3948.5" id=c_"3948.5">__net__</span> training on the fingering. So it's like artificial, artificial, neural. Net's kind of an AI thing where you say, this is a C, this is a D whatever, as you move your fingers around, and then you say, now figure it out and then has to, has to try to make up a whole world that will, fulfill those parameters. And that's actually really exciting to me because I feel like, so I feel like one thing, the, the previous win instrument that I made follow those kind of commercial wind instrument parameters of there's digital buttons on off, there's like a wind sensor pressure thing. And I felt like it was fine for writing notated music where I, I cared about how loud a note it was and what note it was. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>But like, it would, it was a boring instrument for improvisation where like, there's no world outside of those limited things that you could find. There was no, like, if I thought about like a free jazz saxophone player picking <span style="color:red" data-ts="3997.95" data-end_ts="3998.24" title="3997.95" id=c_"3997.95">__this__</span> up, there's no almo register. They could explore or strange squeak, or, you know, they can't do like Evan Parker, crazy stuff on it. Right. Right. And like, I wanna make a win instrument that I'm the thing I'm working on. The goal is I wanna make it something that say a free jazz bonus could pick up and spend, you know, a long time finding these worlds inside, you know, say, okay, here's, you know, here's some really unexpected, crazy thing that can happen and, and it's consistent because it's built into the instrument. Right. So it's like find these kind of consistent extended techniques. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. That makes sense. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>So that's something I'm really excited about. So I'm working on this and I'm hoping to come out with, with it as a Kickstarter campaign to make 25 of them, in the end of the summer, if I'm lucky. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Well, on your, on your website, you also, it also looks like you're talking will potentially doing a Kickstarter for the JD one. Yeah. Is that for real or, or is <span style="color:red" data-ts="4059.12" data-end_ts="4059.32" title="4059.12" id=c_"4059.12">__that__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Kind of <span style="color:red" data-ts="4059.72" data-end_ts="4059.92" title="4059.72" id=c_"4059.72">__falling__</span>? Yeah, I need to update it. I probably won't I've thought about it. Oh. And, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Cause it looks so cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b><laugh> yeah. There's people who want there's, there's definitely people who've been contact me about it. And I've been thinking about it for a long time. It's, it's such a complex thing inside, right. That I worry about it. I'm like, you know, and I've, it's, you know, it's a reliable instrument I've been playing it live for a long time now. That's, that's the one that I play live as my main instrument. Love it. <span style="color:red" data-ts="4085.44" data-end_ts="4085.56" title="4085.44" id=c_"4085.44">__Okay__</span>. Right. But, yeah, I I'll have to think about it if there was enough interest. I would definitely, if I was sure that I'd be able to settle enough at a, at the price that would make sense right. For then I would do it. But, as it stands right now, I'm kind of like, I don't know if I can <laugh> I don't know if I'd be able to, to pull it off. But, so, so right now the plan is the bur the new wind instrument yeah. Is coming out end of summer. I'm also working again on the Manatee, which I had on the back burner for a little while. Which is the way to convert manta USB signals into analog control voltage. Oh, okay. All right. A lot of people want that. <span style="color:red" data-ts="4123.74" data-end_ts="4123.96" title="4123.74" id=c_"4123.74">__So__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="4124.28" data-end_ts="4124.52" title="4124.28" id=c_"4124.28">__Back__</span> working on that, those are my, those are my top priorities right now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>All right. Well, I want to thank you so much for taking the time. Boy, we just, I'm always surprised by how, we'll just start off with a simple question and next thing, you know, it's like, oh my God, an hour's gone away. Yeah. <laugh>, you know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>I can, I can blabber so, well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I believe me, this is, this is the, one of the most enjoyable hours of my week when I get to kind of talk smart about, in this case instrument, building and design and the, the track to get there. It's, it's really fascinating. I want to thank you so much for spending the time with us and for kind of like opening the doors on, on, on how you do what you do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Yeah, no problem. I'm, I'm, I wasn't aware of your podcast until now, so I'm really excited to go back and listen. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, please do there's it's all over the map. It's a lot of fun. All right. Well, yeah, it was great to have you, hopefully I'll be able to get this, quickly edited and up for this weekend. <span style="color:red" data-ts="4190.24" data-end_ts="4190.36" title="4190.24" id=c_"4190.24">__So__</span> I do, I do basically a podcast every Sunday, so I have to kind of hustle to get this one out there, but, again, thanks for dealing with short notice as well. I really appreciate it. Okay. We'll talk to you soon. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Oh, I was just gonna say, Hey, Darwin let me know if you're in New York or New Jersey anytime soon. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Well, yeah, I hope to get out there again relatively soon. I always love spending time there, so all thanks. See you later. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. There you have it. Another great interview in the bag. This one was cool because it ended up giving me a whole list of books to check out and websites to eyeball and, things to Google in order to get up to speed on stuff that Jeff introduced us to as always, I want to thank my listeners and this week, especially my Facebook followers. You all came through for me in a great way. I'll be getting at a lot of these, people in the upcoming weeks, as I'm trying to, plow my way through the summer. It's gonna be kind of busy summer for me, but I'm gonna try and keep up with these podcasts as much as I can. I want to also thank my friends at Lipson for their help in making sure that this thing keeps on rolling. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>All of my friends and coworkers at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_%2774">Cycling '74</a> for their support and, for you the listener, oh my God, that sounds like an NPR spiel, but I wanna thank you the listeners for making it worth doing, we're getting great listenership and I'm just really glad to be able to share these discussions with people, with all of you. Oh, and one last thing. If you happen to be in the Southwest and are, especially if you happen to be, attending the currents new media festival in Santa Fe, first of all, Franken Mariana do a fantastic job of putting together an outstanding festival, but also I'm gonna be there with Andrew PA performing next week, Sunday father's day. <span style="color:red" data-ts="4320.58" data-end_ts="4320.8" title="4320.58" id=c_"4320.58">__We__</span>, and, I'm also going to be working with Corey on, on media design, using Ableton live. And I'm gonna be doing a workshop, specifically on working with convolution as a creative tool. If you're interested in any, any of those subjects or just wanna see me honk away on my modular synth while, Andrew PA works on his, modular synth <span style="color:red" data-ts="4349.2" data-end_ts="4349.32" title="4349.2" id=c_"4349.2">__and__</span> his, win instruments, check us out. It should be a great weekend. So again, that's, the currents new media festival in Santa Fe. Hope to see you there. Otherwise we'll see you next week.
