<b>Darwin: </b>So, hey, how's it going? I'm sorry that I've been gone for the last couple of weeks. I ended up taking a bit of a vacation, and it turned out to be maybe a little less wired than I had ever expected. So, I didn't get a chance to spend a lot of time online, and hence I didn't get a chance to put the podcast out. But we're gonna be kicking it back into gear now, starting this week with, one of my kind of personal pocket favorites as far as artists go. He's a coworker, but he's also a really talented musician. And so I hope you enjoy this. And again, sorry for being gone back now. Let's rock it. Okay. So today we are going to talk to, Tom Hall Tom Hall is one of my, coworkers at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_%2774">Cycling '74</a> You know, I am taking the opportunity to introduce all of you to some of the people that I work with, but, as is the case with a lot of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_%2774">Cycling '74</a> people, he's also really an accomplished artist, and in this case, a very accomplished musician. So I want to introduce you to Tom and I will say hi to Tom. Hi, Tom. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom Hall: </b>Hi Darwin 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thanks a lot for taking the time to chat with us. I know you're a busy guy. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Yeah, no, it's, it's great to finally be on the, on the podcast series after having listened to it for a while. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, thanks. Yeah, I'm glad that, that you listened. It's, I've, it's been a really fun time. I'm really enjoying, getting to talk to a lot, lot of different people. So as a listener then, you probably know, one of the shtick, which is, I kind of like to start off the discussion by asking people to <span style="color:red" data-ts="126.32" data-end_ts="126.44" title="126.32" id=c_"126.32">__give__</span> me a little bit of their background. So I'm gonna hit hit you up with that. Tell us a little bit about where you come from and how you got to where you're at today. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Yeah, well that, I mean, I'll try and summarize it. Grew up in, rural Tasmania, Australia and, you know, finished, finished school and, went to work. There's a lot of people do there in a kind of blue collar industrial situation. And after a few years of observing the guys who'd been in that environment for 10, 20 years, I thought, wow, <span style="color:red" data-ts="161.82" data-end_ts="162.04" title="161.82" id=c_"161.82">__do__</span> you know, do I really wanna become one of these people <laugh>? And, you know, you know, it's a good life. But there was just something in inside of me that, burned to be more creative. And I, you know, to the point where I'd find myself being overtly creative in an industrial workforce, which often ended, ended with me getting, you know, reprimanded for, I don't know, drawing stupid pictures or upending something that wasn't meant to be done. And, <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Those, so I, those environments, they don't want you to be all that creative. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>No, no. They don't want, they want you to think inside the box 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Stay in the box. Right. So yeah, I, I had a real passion for photography when I was studying, and I fortunately realized that I could pretend like I'd failed at school and went back to my college in Tasmania and realized that I could pay a hundred dollars for the full year and use the photographic labs at the college un <span style="color:red" data-ts="230.46" data-end_ts="230.58" title="230.46" id=c_"230.46">__I__</span> unlimited for the whole year. And, you know, I was working full time, so a hundred dollars meant nothing. And I did that and I was just using the, the labs and then I thought, you know, maybe I should go to university and study this. So I went, I applied to a few universities and got into all of them and accepted a scholarship at, at the Australian National University in Canberra. Went off to Japan on another scholarship halfway through my degree. And when I got there, there'd been a miscommunication between the universities and there was no photography department. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>So I got, I got <laugh>, I got put into the video in sound studies, and, that was where I got my, this was early 2000. I got my first intro introduction to Max and Ableton was in its very early days, pro Tools. And, yeah, it, it, it was the audio format that just really spoke to me. I think I'd been already been doing photography for a long <span style="color:red" data-ts="294.04" data-end_ts="294.26" title="294.04" id=c_"294.04">__and__</span>, you know, quite a number of years. And, I just saw sound and especially, you know, more experimental realms, soundscapes, ambient works, textual type work, very, I saw it as a broad, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="310.19" data-end_ts="310.54" title="310.19" id=c_"310.19">__plane__</span> to work with, within the context of art and concept and the legs. And, yeah, just took off from there. And I went back to Australia after my scholarship ended and, and continued working with sound. And, you know, I still still wondered whether I should pursue the photography cuz my degree actually said I was a photographer, <laugh>. And, but, you know, as it happened, it kept being the sound works that really spoke to people. And next thing I actually had people like from the Perth International Arts Festival coming at me and asking me to, to be part of their festival, which is this huge, it's, it's a huge festival and happens every year down there. And, you know, just opportunities like that kept propping up that involved sound. And so I just ended up continuing down that road. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So what kind of, what kind of sound work was it that you were doing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>It was pretty interested in, you know, using field recordings and found sounds. I really started in that, in that kind of area because I had very little understanding of, music or musical concept. I mean, I, I'd played the piano a little bit as a kid and was a little bit self-taught and kind of, you know, had a little bit of training from my, from my mother who can play the piano, but I never pursued it more than maybe a year. So it was, you know, I was, I was total musical nobe and, you know, you just really enjoyed taking sounds from different environments and joining them together and, and kind of making a kind of hyper reality. I mean, I've always been quite fond of traveling and I really enjoyed building a whole database of sounds. And, you know, getting to the stage where I have sounds of, you know, insects and crickets of the same species from <span style="color:red" data-ts="435.68" data-end_ts="435.9" title="435.68" id=c_"435.68">__ev__</span>, you know, almost every continent, and using them to make music, you know, looping and folding and, and manipulating. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. When you're doing that, how are you, do you like make a sampler and then use, use that, or do you just lay 'em out over a timeline in software? Or how do you, how do you work with it? Because I've seen people who use <span style="color:red" data-ts="463.59" data-end_ts="463.94" title="463.59" id=c_"463.59">__phone__</span> sound or lo location recordings <span style="color:red" data-ts="466.44" data-end_ts="466.66" title="466.44" id=c_"466.44">__and__</span> they're all over the map. Some people spend the time mapping that to a sampler. Other people just plop 'em in a Pro tools timeline or whatever. What, what's your preference for that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Yeah, well, you know, initially in the early days of working with things like Ableton Max, even <span style="color:red" data-ts="486.48" data-end_ts="486.7" title="486.48" id=c_"486.48">__Gar__</span> Garage <span style="color:red" data-ts="487.57" data-end_ts="487.86" title="487.57" id=c_"487.57">__Band__</span>, you know, I was just using very <span style="color:red" data-ts="492.24" data-end_ts="492.46" title="492.24" id=c_"492.24">__mi__</span> you know, tiny Microsamples and, and looping and then applying automation to that, to that kind of length of time. The manipulation varied from delays to, to reverbs and the likes. So it was a very linear structure in terms of like, make a little micro loop and then duplicate it a hundred times on a timeline, and then maybe bring in another one to, to fold in over the top. Sure. But these days I, I probably work more in terms of mapping to samplers and, and things like that. <span style="color:red" data-ts="531.44" data-end_ts="531.66" title="531.44" id=c_"531.44">__As__</span>, as my skillset grew, I, I saw a bigger avenue there for, maybe subverting or changing the, the field recordings into just completely different sounds. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Now, before we, we get closer up to date, I want to ask one more thing, which is these festivals and other people that started getting interested in your work, what was it in in your work that they found particularly interesting? What, what did they focus on? That you could tell? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>I mean, it was, it was pretty location based. I mean, the, I I got a small, I was, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="574.3" data-end_ts="574.42" title="574.3" id=c_"574.3">__I__</span>, it was very conceptual and, and, and, you know, I, I always had these crazy concepts behind works. And I, I applied for a small grant to the Australian Arts Council, and, and they gave me a few thousand dollars. And I, I, I spent about six months recording all these sounds from the, the Story Bridge, which is a, a kind of iconic bridge in Brisbane, in northern Australia. The northern capital of, north of Queensland. And it's also, I mean, it's probably, it's like <span style="color:red" data-ts="615.96" data-end_ts="616.38" title="615.96" id=c_"615.96">__Sydney__</span>, the Sydney Harbor Bridges, little brother Okay. Or younger brother, the same guy who built the Sydney Harbor Bridge, which is quite famous. He gets used in a lot of tourism for promoting Australia. Right. The same guy finished the Sydney Harbor Bridge and then went straight to Brisbane and built the story bridge. I see. And it's, it's a different type of bridge, the double cantilever bridge, and it's, it, it moves a lot. It moves a lot. It has these huge expansion joints and it creaks and groans and drones and, it's just, yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="650.8" data-end_ts="651.02" title="650.8" id=c_"650.8">__For__</span> someone who <span style="color:red" data-ts="651.54" data-end_ts="651.66" title="651.54" id=c_"651.54">__is__</span> into field recording, it's just, it's awesome. Just 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b><laugh>. It's just, I mean, so I think to the person walking under it, they're just like, wow, this thing is incredibly noisy. But, the sounds <span style="color:red" data-ts="663.58" data-end_ts="663.82" title="663.58" id=c_"663.58">__that__</span> I was able to extract from that was phenomenal. And it just got a lot of press. It was phenomenal. I released it and it was this weird thing. Actually. I had a, I had a kind of sound video installation happening in these, kind of like a shop front in Brisbane. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>And it got broken into, with only within a few days of its starting some opportunist looked in there and thought, oh, I can use that VCR <laugh> and I can use that. And, yeah, it got broken into, and, you know, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="699.1" data-end_ts="699.42" title="699.1" id=c_"699.1">__filed__</span>, there was some of the equipment was worth a few hundred dollars, so I filed a police report and of course, never saw any of that equipment again. But the local or the, the kind of national newspaper for the state wanted to do called me up out of the blue. I think they watched, they watched the police reports and thought, oh, this will make for a great story, you know, artist, artist, hard luck story, you know. Right. Poor artist gets his gear stolen, just trying to, you know, and I didn't wanna be that person. So when they called me, I just had this, you know, I almost said no and just hung up straight away. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>And then I was like, actually, you know what, I have this album coming out, and I was able to convince the reporter that she should do the story on my album and, and totally just ditched the, the Hard Luck <span style="color:red" data-ts="750.96" data-end_ts="751.38" title="750.96" id=c_"750.96">__artist__</span> story. And that's what she did. And it ended up, they loved the story and it ran on page two of the newspaper and next thing, like a mainstream TV channel wanted to do a, an interview, like a live story about me. And yeah, just kind of rolled on from there. And then I was able from, and, and you know, the, the kind of way the arts councils <span style="color:red" data-ts="774.42" data-end_ts="774.54" title="774.42" id=c_"774.42">__a__</span> and funding bodies in Australia work is, you know, they really like bang for Buck. So they, they gave me two grand and I gave them a lot of <laugh>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="782.83" data-end_ts="783.18" title="782.83" id=c_"782.83">__Right__</span>. A lot, a lot recognition back in return. And so then I was able to picture a kind of, a live sound tour to them. And yeah, I got funding for that. And, did a few sound walks in different cities and the likes, and then got more press for that. And then you, yeah. Next thing I know, the Perth International Arts Festival is contacting me totally out of the blue, asking me if I'll go over there and, and be part of the festival and present <span style="color:red" data-ts="813.14" data-end_ts="813.3" title="813.14" id=c_"813.14">__at__</span> work and work with some other artists. And yeah, it just kind of snowballed. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's really amazing. All from, all from a screwed up, university scholarship gig. That's amazing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Pretty much, I mean, yeah, it did. And that story just goes on because I mean, that scholarship, I was, I met my wife who, who, well, I met a girl who's now my wife, who was on a scholarship there at the same time. And, and we actually parted ways and never saw each other again. And I was here in, in, in America on a sound tour on a scholarship, and, <laugh> ran into her in New York. It just, it's just crazy, really. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's something. So, once you, once you kind of made a bit of a mark in Australia, you're not in Australia anymore, something obviously happened to pull you, into, into the US and particularly to la what happened? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Yeah, well, things continued on in Australia and, you know, us having a, having a good time and, you know, the, especially in, you know, last, last decade, the Arts council were pretty forthcoming with funding in the kind of more exploratory realms of sound. And, you know, I was getting grants and doing little tours around Australia and, and that's, and that's good fun. But, you know, once you've been to Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth, five times, you know, five times <span style="color:red" data-ts="918.04" data-end_ts="918.26" title="918.04" id=c_"918.04">__to__</span> each of those places in one year, people will start to be like, oh, what? This guy's coming around for another town too already. <span style="color:red" data-ts="927.4" data-end_ts="927.62" title="927.4" id=c_"927.4">__He__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="927.97" data-end_ts="928.26" title="927.97" id=c_"927.97">__here__</span> last <span style="color:red" data-ts="928.54" data-end_ts="928.78" title="928.54" id=c_"928.54">__month__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Why won't he leave us alone? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Yeah. Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="932.09" data-end_ts="932.38" title="932.09" id=c_"932.09">__What__</span> is this playing? Yeah, it <span style="color:red" data-ts="934.39" data-end_ts="934.74" title="934.39" id=c_"934.39">__start__</span>, so I started hearing a lot and, and at the time I was living in Brisbane and had a pretty, diverse, scene in that the kind of experimental guys would mix in with the, the kind of do metal guys. And, and it wasn't really split up. So they would, you would find yourself playing on the bill with like the biggest do <span style="color:red" data-ts="960.86" data-end_ts="961.1" title="960.86" id=c_"960.86">__metal__</span> band in, in the town at the time, and you would hear stories about touring abroad and the likes. So I, I thought maybe I can do that. So first off, I went to Japan, back to Japan again. Cuz I mean, Japan has, you know, for what is a small country size-wise, it has a lot of places that you can go to and, and play. I mean, compared to Australia, you, you can do 14, 15, 16 dates, in 16 days, it's a lot easier to transverse that country. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>You've got the thesing <span style="color:red" data-ts="999.46" data-end_ts="999.74" title="999.46" id=c_"999.46">__constant__</span> bullet train and the likes. So I, I literally did go there and just play fly there, play every night and fly home. And that was just a blast. So I, so I did that a few years in, in a row and then thought, okay, let's, let's start mixing it up. And, at the time I had started a, kind of side project to my more exploratory solo works with another guy, Ian Rogers. We had started to kind of fold in some melody with more exploratory sound, and that was, this was called Axon, and that's kind of like a band project. We called it a band, but it was two guys with laptops and a synth and maybe like one hardware synthesizer. And, we, me and him thought, oh, let's go and see if we can tour Europe. And this was back in like the MySpace days still. So we literally booked a two month tour in England and the whole of Europe off the back of like contacting similar bands via MySpace. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh my goodness. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>I know. I kind of, I think back <span style="color:red" data-ts="1079.6" data-end_ts="1079.82" title="1079.6" id=c_"1079.6">__to__</span> this, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1080.37" data-end_ts="1080.66" title="1080.37" id=c_"1080.37">__it's__</span> like, how the hell did that even work? Right? How, how did, how did we not just get to the first place and then they just robbed us of all <span style="color:red" data-ts="1088.98" data-end_ts="1089.18" title="1088.98" id=c_"1088.98">__our__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1089.25" data-end_ts="1089.54" title="1089.25" id=c_"1089.25">__fear__</span> <laugh>. And then, and then we just like have to call the Australian consulate and beg, beg for a passport to get home. Like, I just can't believe we even did that. It blows up. It'd be like trying to book a tour off Facebook now something. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1106.66" data-end_ts="1106.86" title="1106.66" id=c_"1106.66">__Right__</span>. It just is ridiculous. But it, it worked and it was just phenomenal. Like we, we had guys even telling us, okay, this at this show, before we even turned up, before they even, you know, before people even came to the venue for the gig, they'd be like, okay, we're gonna give you 150 pounds and we'd, we'd get there and then give us 150 pounds. Like, it was amazing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Wow. Yeah. In a way, there, there was some innocence wrapped up in the internet, so, you know, people hadn't been burned too much and Right. And so it was sort of like, you felt like I can trust these internet people even more than I can trust real life people. Yeah. And that, that worked for a while. Now it's just flipped the opposite <span style="color:red" data-ts="1152.04" data-end_ts="1152.26" title="1152.04" id=c_"1152.04">__now__</span>. Nobody trusts anything they hear online. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Yeah. I think, I think you're <span style="color:red" data-ts="1156.94" data-end_ts="1157.06" title="1156.94" id=c_"1156.94">__so__</span> right. Like <span style="color:red" data-ts="1157.54" data-end_ts="1157.74" title="1157.54" id=c_"1157.54">__you__</span>, it was, there wasn't a single situation where it was like, oh, this is dodgy <laugh>. Every, every gig was fun. And even even the weirdest one, which was in, Rotterdam. Rotterdam, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>In Rotterdam, the two of us had been <span style="color:red" data-ts="1175.5" data-end_ts="1175.86" title="1175.5" id=c_"1175.5">__booked__</span>, like booked as Axon and they'd listened to like a 22nd snippet off of MySpace. And it just happened to be one of the few pieces where there was no distortion on and it was like a little blippy four four beat. And they somehow, in their mind thought that we were like a minimal take no band that was gonna play for like three hours or something, <laugh>. Oh man, we get to this bar and it is crazy. Like they think they offered a guarantee of something crazy, like 300, 300 euros or something. Like it was pretty good, pretty good coin <span style="color:red" data-ts="1214.76" data-end_ts="1214.98" title="1214.76" id=c_"1214.76">__cuz__</span> we were like, oh yeah, we're just gonna do like a 30 minute set and we start playing and yeah. And there's this, like, when we get there, there's this sound guy who is also not your normal sound guy for what's a E D M. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>He was like a rock guy. So he turns out he's got like a leather jacket on and oh man. And he's like, he's not happy. He doesn't, because they woke him up to come and mix this or something and he's not that happy. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1244.03" data-end_ts="1244.38" title="1244.03" id=c_"1244.03">__Cause__</span> you know, he is <span style="color:red" data-ts="1245.06" data-end_ts="1245.18" title="1245.06" id=c_"1245.06">__like__</span> got <span style="color:red" data-ts="1245.38" data-end_ts="1245.7" title="1245.38" id=c_"1245.38">__great__</span>, or some kind of EDM guys that need to be mixed. What the hell? And what happens is we start playing and the manager of the bar wants to shut us down, but the rock sound guy in the leather jacket thinks that we're the best thing he's ever heard in the bar, ever. He's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Into it. Yeah. <laugh>. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>He's like guarding the desk. He's like, he's hovering over the desk full body so that the, the bar manager can't turn us off. And in the meantime, we have these angry Dutch girls coming up to us screaming at us in Dutch, and what they're saying is that they don't like it off. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1284.42" data-end_ts="1284.54" title="1284.42" id=c_"1284.42">__No__</span>. And my, and I remember the guy playing with me, Ian says to the girl, like, we don't understand what you're saying. She's like, the people in this room don't appreciate your music <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>And, man, and then 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So even when they tell you that you suck there, at least being very polite about it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Yeah. <laugh>. Yeah, exactly. Then no one threw anything at us or anything, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1308.52" data-end_ts="1308.74" title="1308.52" id=c_"1308.52">__so__</span>, but, we finished and, and the, you know, the finished and the barman still <span style="color:red" data-ts="1314.24" data-end_ts="1314.46" title="1314.24" id=c_"1314.24">__con__</span>, you know, they still continue to give us the rider that they told us we could have. Right. And they still paid us, you know, like, and said thanks. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1323.41" data-end_ts="1323.7" title="1323.41" id=c_"1323.41">__It's__</span> just bizarre. So yeah, there was that. And then, in the meantime I, I'd, there was something called the Lord Mayors Fellowship back in Brisbane, and it was kind of a, a scholarship slash self initiated, residency kind of program. And I'd pitched that maybe I would work with, Christopher Willett. Okay. And, and whilst I was in Europe, I'd get back from that tour and I'm, and I've got a letter in the mail and it says that I've got it and then I can come to America and, work with Christopher Willis. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>So it just kind of, just the snow as you know, the snow con continues then, then the, in the meantime it's just, it was just a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1378.17" data-end_ts="1378.49" title="1378.17" id=c_"1378.17">__crazy__</span> time. Axon was really taking off in Australia and there were some labels that were interested, but, you know, no one was really forthcoming. And I came to America and the, my, my band mate Ian, after two months on tour in Europe, you know, I, I'd been doing a bunch of touring in Japan and the likes and was pretty accustomed to the sleeping on couches and diy, kind of regime you need to have as a solo artist if you're gonna actually survive. Right. But he was pretty frazzled when he got back to Australia. And, I think he was quite happy that I'd got the, the scholarship to, to piss off to America <laugh> so that he could have a break. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>And I was pretty driven, pretty motivated. And I think maybe, it was just, he, he had a few other things he was trying to finish a PhD in, in new music studies and I think it was just a, a bit much. But, so I came to, I came over here to the States and was based up in San Francisco and the premise of me wanting to work with Willits was to, develop, some of my Max Max chops more. And it <span style="color:red" data-ts="1460.9" data-end_ts="1461.18" title="1460.9" id=c_"1460.9">__kind__</span> of worked, but it ended up working, more on kind of content production with Willits rather than actual programming. Which made, made more sense once they got here. You know, when you see someone's work and you think it's hard to know what kind of, level someone's programming is. Right. And so when, you know, we realized that we were kind of more on par together as users of Max than we were him being, being able to, to teach me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>So we tended to kind of collaborate a bit more and you know, he definitely gave me a good insight into how he works, and that, and so that was pretty cool hanging out in San Francisco. And, but the real highlight for me was, Willits actually didn't wanna hang out with me that much. <laugh> <laugh>, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1523.02" data-end_ts="1523.22" title="1523.02" id=c_"1523.02">__think__</span> he was like, what's this dude? Just gimme some money. You stink in Australian. And, only <span style="color:red" data-ts="1529.66" data-end_ts="1530.1" title="1529.66" id=c_"1529.66">__comment__</span>, you're only allowed to bother me for a few hours a week. And after that, I don't want to hear from you and, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1539.48" data-end_ts="1539.7" title="1539.48" id=c_"1539.48">__And__</span>, but you know what, just before I left Australia, there was this, there's a really awesome sound series that happens each year in Australia called, liquid Architecture. And it's been happening now for I think maybe like 13 or 14 years. It's a, it's a tour program, but it often includes a lot of international artists. And there's been this really awesome video work by Scott <span style="color:red" data-ts="1563.08" data-end_ts="1563.5" title="1563.08" id=c_"1563.08">__Alfred__</span> from San Francisco, and he's kind of old school sound guy that's been up there in, you know, doing stuff. He's also an architect in, in San Francisco. And you know, he knows Joshua, Ben Bracken, he, you know, he knows all a lot of the cycling guys and he is been around forever. He used to have a d i y kind of warehouse venue that ran for, you know, sound events for years. And I thought, oh, what's the chance of like, maybe I'll just hit him up out of the blue. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>And I hit him up and, actually ended up moving into his warehouse for a while as you do. And he was awesome. I mean, you know, working, I ended up kind of almost, it was weird like almost swapped from working with Willard to working more with Scott <span style="color:red" data-ts="1620.5" data-end_ts="1620.9" title="1620.5" id=c_"1620.5">__Alfred__</span>. You know, and he was big into hardware as well, so, you know, he had a lot of hardware, syns and hardware, everything. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1631.24" data-end_ts="1631.46" title="1631.24" id=c_"1631.24">__And__</span> less on the computer side. So it was probably, that was around that time when I was really getting more into to hardware. So it's like late two thousands Okay. Where I was like, okay, let's, let's, I can do both here. I can use both. And, definitely it was around that time where, you know, in, in Axon, it was the other guy was kind of more, Ian was more taking care of melody and, and it was my, me learning really fast. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Okay. This is a four four beat <laugh>. Right. And this is a melody. And because I, like I said before, I didn't have any traditional music training. Right. But I had, you know, I kind of had no problems picking it up pretty quickly. And, and that continued on. And, then I went to New York and played at the fabulous venue monkey town. Right. That existed there in Brooklyn. Yeah. That was just fantastic. What a, what a venue, surround video setup and, 16 channel audio setup. And it actually, I think the place stopped actually functioning only a few months after I was there. It, it just couldn't find itself anymore. It was a kind of unique hybrid environment where they would have a sound event, but the people on the floor would have a waiter as well. And yeah, it was, it was pretty cool. But I think it, yeah, I, I dunno, I think they really had to work hard to, to keep it in the, above the red. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>But that was, that was great. And that was actually where I walked into the coffee shop and, and re-met the, the, the lady who's now my, my wife. Oh, that's, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's some kind <span style="color:red" data-ts="1747.81" data-end_ts="1748.01" title="1747.81" id=c_"1747.81">__of__</span> story. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So I've, I'm curious about something, in hearing, your background and, and all the different things you did. An awful lot of them were funded by arts councils or art groups or or educational scholarship. A lot of those things are starting to disappear now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Mm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Or at least it seems like it to most people. Is it, is it your experience that that environment is 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Changing? Definitely. I mean, it's changed. It's, it's even changed in Australia a lot. I mean, definitely after being here, I thought to myself like, I could, I could, I'm still technically an Australian citizen and I can write grants for Australia still, but they're actually really, yeah, it's really dried up a lot. And they've changed the whole, you know, the whole expectations of the, of the artists as well. And yeah, it's definitely, I, I always made a point of not, of not making it. So, okay, this project will only happen if I get funding. Cuz I definitely had, some peers of mine that would purely rely on that and if the funding didn't come true, the project didn't happen kind of thing. Right. And I, I just never felt right about that. I mean, you know, in all that time things were snowballing in Australia. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>I actually had a, my original job I had, before I even started photography, the warehouse I worked in was a, a fruit and vegetable distribution warehouse for large supermarket chain. And so I knew, I knew all my, you know, I knew the difference between a, a cauliflower and a cabbage <laugh> and, <laugh>. Yeah. Those kind of things. But, you know, so what I did was, even whilst all that stuff was snowballing, the arts castle, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1873.34" data-end_ts="1873.46" title="1873.34" id=c_"1873.34">__I__</span> actually was fortunate enough to get a job at a supermarket chain Kohls that was right next door to my house, <laugh>. Oh my. Yeah. It was incredible. I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1885.22" data-end_ts="1885.42" title="1885.22" id=c_"1885.22">__li__</span> you know, it was amazing. I could get up at, at 5:30 AM in the morning and, and be at work at 5 35 kind of thing. And, you know, even that environment's changed, but at the time, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1899.52" data-end_ts="1899.74" title="1899.52" id=c_"1899.52">__mar__</span> the Kohl's supermarket was like the underdog to this other major chain and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1905.02" data-end_ts="1905.18" title="1905.02" id=c_"1905.02">__the__</span>, there wasn't this huge pressure environment to, you know, hit the bottom dollar mark all the time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>And, the staff were, you know, I was very open about pretty much from the get go that, look, my arts career is more important than you <laugh>. Right. I don't know, it was pretty blatant now that I look back at it and it was almost verging on rude, maybe <laugh>. Right. But they, you know, because of that, I really shared with them a lot, you know, more than a lot of, I think, non-artistic, work environments I've been in. And they really, you know, they were really into it. I think they didn't entirely understand it, but certainly were impressed that I was able to get, funded to go on tours and things like that. And, incredibly they would like, I would go off for three months on a tour somewhere and they would, they would literally have my job waiting for me when I got back. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>It was, it was kind of cool cuz I could always bank on having that, that paycheck the week after getting back. And, yeah. In the end I was able to manipulate it to only work the hours, you know, in Australia has some incredibly good, pay scales for, you know, overtime and weekend work. Oh, sure. So I was <span style="color:red" data-ts="1989.5" data-end_ts="1989.62" title="1989.5" id=c_"1989.5">__a__</span>, I was able to, you know, work it <span style="color:red" data-ts="1992.72" data-end_ts="1992.94" title="1992.72" id=c_"1992.72">__so__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1992.94" data-end_ts="1993.06" title="1992.94" id=c_"1992.94">__that__</span> I only worked on the weekends, so I would work like two days and get like $500 or something. I see. Yeah. So that was kind of, that was always my backbone. And so I never completely relied on the, the funding environment. I always tended to look at it more as a lottery ticket. You know, every grant <laugh>, right. Every, every grant I put in is another lottery ticket. It might come up, it might not. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's really interesting that though that you took that approach because an awful lot of people go the other way or make the other assumption, which is that the second that I get a legit job, then I'm not really an artist anymore. And so what they'll do is they'll put themselves in a position where they're always at risk and they're always kind of over the barrel because they don't have any kind of steady paycheck coming in. And, it makes, you know, you, you talk to these people and you almost always can get this sense of like, this combination of desperation and high stress Yeah. Related to the financial part of making a living while being an artist. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Yeah. I I think maybe I, I mean, yeah, I totally relate to that and, and definitely always felt like, you know, apart from a few that were very good at managing, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2077.52" data-end_ts="2077.74" title="2077.52" id=c_"2077.52">__and__</span>, and to be an artist these days, you really have to be multifaceted unless you are showing in the, the big major galleries on a regular basis. Right. But you know, I, I certainly saw that with my peers and then some of my, you know, other, other people that I looked up to. But I, I wonder if, for me it was more the fact that rather than going straight from school, transitioning from like, you know, high school into university and then being like, I'm going to continue being an artist, but I, I, I lived and worked and supported myself for a few years before I even went to university. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>So even in my, I still remember like my first year of university how in incredibly reliant some of the, the students were on their parents. And it used to kind of just blow my mind. And, and it wasn't even like my parents would kick me out the door, we don't wanna talk to you anymore, swim or sink. They were incredibly supportive. But I, I kind of did pride myself on my own independence as well. And you know, just having after work full time, it's hard to go back to living on ultra ultra shoestring two minute noodle, budget. So, you know, I was like, well, I'm, I'm happy to make, you know, obscure experimental art. I'm well aware that it's not gonna bring me in a hundred thousand dollars a year. So I'm gonna offset it with some, some work that I know can bring me in some extra coin 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right now. One of the things I'm curious, you and I share something which is, we both grew up in rural parts of the country. Right. And, I'm always curious when I when I talk to other people that come from a rural background, I'm always curious to find out what they think was the positive and the negative aspects of that. So I'm curious for, for you, what are the things that ha that you know, are stumbling blocks and what are the things that have helped you succeed to whatever level you succeeded, that come from a rural background? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Yeah. I, I think for sure, for me, one of the biggest, assets of growing up in that environment is just space. I mean, I grew up on a, a large, you know, not a large farm, not a, but you know, a decent amount of space in that I could leave the family home and go down to the back of the property. I couldn't hear my mother <laugh>. I couldn't, I couldn't hear, I couldn't hear the traffic. I couldn't hear anything, you know, and it was, I used to love doing that. Yeah. I'd just have the dog with me, you know, my sidekick and, and you know, I'd be, I'd be, I'd get ambitious and decide I was gonna cut a tree down or something and the dog would be digging in a hole beside me. And that was fun, apparently. Right. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>And so, you know, but I think for other people that can really screw them as well, they don't like that solitude or that space. I know, I know my wife has a little bit of trouble going to Tasmania and, you know, how quiet it is and how <span style="color:red" data-ts="2285.58" data-end_ts="2285.86" title="2285.58" id=c_"2285.58">__little__</span>, you know, how little infrastructure there is. But, and then, you know, the, the kind of flip side and the, and the, the negative would be that when you are in <span style="color:red" data-ts="2297.46" data-end_ts="2297.58" title="2297.46" id=c_"2297.46">__that__</span> environment is the lack. And, and maybe not so much these days, but I, I definitely, you know, we didn't have the internet for a long time <span style="color:red" data-ts="2307.53" data-end_ts="2307.82" title="2307.53" id=c_"2307.53">__till__</span> maybe my mid, mid teens. Okay. And even then, it was painfully slow. You know, we <span style="color:red" data-ts="2315.38" data-end_ts="2315.58" title="2315.38" id=c_"2315.38">__took__</span> 10 minutes to check your Hotmail. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>And that's if you could get the dial up to even connect. But, yeah, I mean the, it was probably the thing was lack of exposure. I mean, there was one small gallery in town, which we would visit occasionally, but you know, it would just have local rural, audio, rural, oil paintings, you know, right. Of farms <laugh>. Right. The very thing you stare at every day. <laugh>. That was kind of funny. But, yeah, so I guess that exposure, but it didn't, you know, I think I kind of, I did strive for that and I definitely re remember being pretty really enthused about the internet and just being one of those kids that would just Google stuff endlessly like to learn about things and I'd hear about something and I would check the facts online and, right. I'd certainly liked encyclopedias and things like that, just information. But yeah, I think it, it, it, I think it's a, especially coming in and, and now having lived in LA for a, a number of years, having that perspective to fall back on when you're like in a city that doesn't, doesn't <span style="color:red" data-ts="2396.15" data-end_ts="2396.5" title="2396.15" id=c_"2396.15">__sleep__</span>, doesn't sleep, and it's just pure pace. Having the ability to step out of that mind in a mind way, mindful way, without leaving LA is important. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Now, you, you talk about LA as being a city that doesn't sleep, but there's another thing that I would say about la which is that it's a city that doesn't care. Yeah. You know, if you come there and you think that, Hey, I'm in la come knock at my door. I'm ready for ready to do all the cool stuff that I was there, they'll just, you know, nobody there cares because, you know, a thousand budding artists of whatever sort show up every single day. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Which is very different from what it sounds like your background was, which is you found a way to sort of like put yourself in a position to be around people who, could care about the things you were doing. How does, how does that transition work for you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Yeah, I mean, that, that's definitely true. And definitely, maybe a little bit of a stumbling block from my transition into LA in that, you know, Australia is a pretty small population. I mean, there's the half, half of the Australian population lives in LA County, basically. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>You know, it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2485.46" data-end_ts="2485.7" title="2485.46" id=c_"2485.46">__kind__</span>. And so there certainly is an abundance of people and people doing everything you can think of and artists and the likes. So, but something I, I was intrigued was I just, I expected it to have a bigger, grassroots kind of scene. And it's not that big. It was incredibly easy to, to discover and, meet all the main players of, the kind of experimental scene or the sound scene and even into the, more obscure metal arena. Right. Yeah. It's, it's a funny one I think because, unless LA is that kind of place where, unless you're a mainstream band that can make, make a club thousands of dollars on a Tuesday night, there is not, there's not a lot of spaces to, to practice. Right. That's something that, you know, I actually, it's bizarre, but I almost felt like we had more options of, of venues to choose from in back in, in Brisbane, you know, a city of like, less than 2000, 2 million, less than 2 million people, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2565.73" data-end_ts="2566.02" title="2565.73" id=c_"2565.73">__than__</span> we did in la. Right. But yeah, I mean, definitely the perspective isn't a funny one because, I mean, I definitely meet a lot of people who come to LA and think, I'm gonna be an actor. I'm gonna be <span style="color:red" data-ts="2578.98" data-end_ts="2579.1" title="2578.98" id=c_"2578.98">__a__</span>, I'm gonna be <span style="color:red" data-ts="2580.54" data-end_ts="2580.66" title="2580.54" id=c_"2580.54">__a__</span> movie director, I'm gonna be this. And, yeah. It's what I heard it once, like, it's made out to be the place where people, you know, where dreams are made, but it's more like where <span style="color:red" data-ts="2592.98" data-end_ts="2593.26" title="2592.98" id=c_"2592.98">__dream__</span> dreams come to die. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's where dreams are crushed. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Yeah. So, you know, which didn't really apply to me cuz I didn't really move here with this whole idea of being like, oh, I'm gonna make it in la cuz it wasn't, it wasn't the intended reason. It was, I mean, if anything bigger reason was, you know, my wife was having a hard time in Australia and we were like, let's go live in LA for a while. So, that was basically the premise of it. And, I didn't see any reason why I couldn't, why I couldn't do it. The whole immigration process was a bit of a pain in the ass and, and, a bit more paperwork than I expected <laugh>. But, that all kind of ironed out in the end. So, but, yeah, it's a, it's a unique environment in Los Angeles and definitely I think a lot of it has to do with how spread out and sparse it is. I mean, there's, there's little niche sound noise scenes happening in the valley, and then there's a little bit of a one on the west side and there's a much larger one over in the Chinatown Los Florist area. And, and a lot of it comes down to like, people have been at work all day or they're tired and it's like, do I wanna drive 20 miles across to the other side of la 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>To, to spend an hour and a half at a gig and then drive home again and then have to go to work in the morning. And yeah. It's funny, but it's, it's, it's really split up a lot as well. It's, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, let's talk a little bit about the music that you do, because we've, we've talked mostly about your background, but you've dropped a few hints that I think will help, help the listeners kind of understand where you're coming from in that you found yourself not only doing this sound work with I, which I think everyone sort of imagines when you think of art artful sound work, you have a tendency to think of, you know, pastoral ambient kind of tones. But I think, one thing to consider is that, one of the first times you ever shared a review of your work, it was the person who had, decided to call you a maximalist Yeah. As opposed to the minimalist <laugh>, which I thought was pretty hilarious. But it actually does talk, it does kind of point to some specifics about your work. First of all, this idea of using distortion as sort of a, an important building block is really something that you, that you do a lot. And so it kind of makes sense to hear that you had done, you had done shared gigs with like metal bands and doom metal bands and stuff like that because there's a certain part of your sonic aesthetic that just kind of goes that way anyway. And then the Axon thing was very much, very energetic. It was not by any means an ambient, thing. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Like first of all, again, where does, where does that come from given that you grew up, you know, with your dog by a creek in a farm, <laugh>. Right. But secondly, how does, how did that kind of influence your growth as well? Because, I mean, one of the things I would say is that of all of sort of the sonic worlds out there, it seems like metal oriented music, scenes tend to <span style="color:red" data-ts="2825.52" data-end_ts="2825.8" title="2825.52" id=c_"2825.52">__have__</span>, tend to be really open to a lot of experimentation. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Yeah, that's true. You know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2833.58" data-end_ts="2833.8" title="2833.58" id=c_"2833.58">__and__</span>, and knowing a lot of guys who play metal bands, they're incredibly technical with, melody and notation. But yeah, like you said, they're definitely open to experimentation. I mean, my upbringing sound wise was my, my mother is into a very diverse range of music from jazz to country to <span style="color:red" data-ts="2856.08" data-end_ts="2856.3" title="2856.08" id=c_"2856.08">__pop__</span> to metal. And then, you know, I would discover different things and they never discouraged me from like listening or pursuing a certain sound, music more. I mean, I grew up, when, when I first really started getting into music, I still <span style="color:red" data-ts="2876.7" data-end_ts="2876.86" title="2876.7" id=c_"2876.7">__had__</span> kid, you know, guns <span style="color:red" data-ts="2878.48" data-end_ts="2878.7" title="2878.48" id=c_"2878.48">__and__</span> Roses were big and hair metal was happening, you know, skid Row and Motley Crue and all of those bands, Nirvana hadn't even come along yet. Metallica were going off the massive and yeah, I, you know, I would see the t-shirts as well everywhere cuz the t-shirts were phenomenal in the, the graphics that they would print t-shirts. They're incredibly offensive. <laugh>. Yeah. You know, I just, you know, I remember that Metallica t-shirt metal up your ass and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2912.44" data-end_ts="2912.66" title="2912.44" id=c_"2912.44">__had__</span> Right. You know, it is just a kill 'em all and Oh man. But as a kid also, like, especially when you get into a late childhood, you wanna, you're just starting to learn to rebel a little bit. It's like, I want those t-shirts <laugh>. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2928.43" data-end_ts="2928.78" title="2928.43" id=c_"2928.43">__Cause__</span> that's likely to be something that'll piss my parents off. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Yeah. And piss off the T-shirt. Right? Yes. It <span style="color:red" data-ts="2934.38" data-end_ts="2934.5" title="2934.38" id=c_"2934.38">__was__</span>. Well, and so I never got discouraged by my parents in listening to that music, but I never, you know, when I, I never saw myself as being a musician and was actually really into athletics in school and my creative focus was on photography. And then when I started working with sound, I was like, well, I dunno if I'm gonna ever spend the time to learn to play guitar so I can finally play those metal riffs, <laugh>. And but then when I realized that, oh, hey, I can play, I actually really like playing the keys and then if I feed the synthesizer <span style="color:red" data-ts="2973.97" data-end_ts="2974.46" title="2973.97" id=c_"2973.97">__through__</span> a distortion pedal, it kind of sounds like a really wild guitar. And, yeah, I guess I started to fold more of that, abrasive sound into, you know, into my, I started using it in field recordings and I started, you know, working with it more and saw it more as a, as a tool. And I think distortion is, it's, it's something that gets pigeonholed a little bit, often as a, you know, it's, it's this tour or a pedal that gets used mainly by rock metal bands, occasionally by rock bands on the low settings heads up. You know, for me, I I I really like the overtones and the harmonics that come when you really start to push a sound maybe into a place that was <span style="color:red" data-ts="3028.4" data-end_ts="3028.62" title="3028.4" id=c_"3028.4">__met__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3028.63" data-end_ts="3028.98" title="3028.63" id=c_"3028.63">__guard__</span>. But, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well it's interesting that, that you say that too, because it does seem like a lot of people, I was just listening to another podcast, earlier this week and they were talking about guitar pedalers in general and someone was like, oh yeah, it's really cool because you put a, you put pedals on your guitar and then you can be sloppy and it still sounds good. And there is sort of like this thing that says, you know, the use of pedals or the use of effects is some sort of crutch. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Mm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But, especially in your case, it seems like you've taken the, the sort of like the conceptual basis of distortion as, kind of a core instrumentation tool. I would say that practically everything I've heard of yours has some level of distortion and it's not always metal in your face style distortion. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, even when you're doing, more ethereal work, you're using a distort, you're using distortion as sort of an expansion of the sound scape. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Definitely. I mean, something that, you know, people were shut <span style="color:red" data-ts="3098.5" data-end_ts="3098.7" title="3098.5" id=c_"3098.5">__down__</span> like, wow, what did you do to that piano <laugh>? Or did <span style="color:red" data-ts="3102.54" data-end_ts="3102.74" title="3102.54" id=c_"3102.54">__you__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3102.76" data-end_ts="3102.98" title="3102.76" id=c_"3102.76">__see__</span> to that? And it's like, well, yeah, I took it through this pedal and then I brought it back in and I folded it back on itself and then I dropped the amplitude right down. And, you know, cuz it's, there's this, as soon as you <span style="color:red" data-ts="3115.08" data-end_ts="3115.3" title="3115.08" id=c_"3115.08">__say__</span> a distortion, often people <span style="color:red" data-ts="3116.97" data-end_ts="3117.26" title="3116.97" id=c_"3116.97">__were__</span>, you know, they think abrasive, loud, obnoxious, right. Those kind of words come to mind. But it can be really subtle and it can be, you know, I find it has this warm quality. I mean, you know, I guess it has the fuzz, the fuzz quality, it can really warm up the sound and with, with certain instrumentation, it can highlight some of the kind of tone from a piano, from a synth, from a aba, from a, you know, and, and really kind of, bring tones to the forefront that you probably wouldn't notice otherwise. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. They, they'd otherwise be hidden. Right. Yeah. So of course I would be stupid if I didn't ask. What distortion pedal do you tend to use? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Well, I, I'm a big fan of the, proco rat pedal. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>It's <span style="color:red" data-ts="3179.08" data-end_ts="3179.32" title="3179.08" id=c_"3179.08">__kinda__</span> a classic and it has, you know, it really, you know, it's got three dials just distortion, volume and, and tone. But you know, I I still find it incredibly versatile. The, the, they make this high gain one, the C 60 db. Right. That's kind of, you know, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="3201.43" data-end_ts="3201.72" title="3201.43" id=c_"3201.43">__kind__</span> of always go to a point where, there's, there's not even, it's not even distortion anymore. It's like just hit, it's hit the peak limit of amplitude and it only the very smallest of, of sound is getting through anymore. And I kind of like, I, I really enjoy working in that kind of realm. Almost the broken speaker right cabinet kind of realm. But often it, that won't be the, the sole sound piece on its own. It might be combined with the original or something like that. Texturally, but I also have the boss, md MD two Oh 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Which is one of those funny ones where you have the, the bass and the treble dial is, it's like two part dial. It's, it's a kind of funny pedal. And then I have, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3262.11" data-end_ts="3262.46" title="3262.11" id=c_"3262.11">__which__</span> they're not, it would be cool if Moog made a distortion pedal, but they don't. But they, I have a bunch of those moga fogger pedals, which are actually for distortion <span style="color:red" data-ts="3276.16" data-end_ts="3276.38" title="3276.16" id=c_"3276.16">__and__</span> just phenomenal because you, they have the output and the drive, and you can really push them a lot. And I just, you know, I think the analog circuitry really just makes it, it just takes it to another, another level. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's interesting you say that because, I have been fortunate enough to see your, your workspace, which is pretty awash with MOG stuff. You've got a lot of Moog stuff, but you're also a hardware guy. And I think it's interesting because right now I would say that the majority <span style="color:red" data-ts="3312.42" data-end_ts="3312.62" title="3312.42" id=c_"3312.42">__of__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3312.62" data-end_ts="3312.74" title="3312.62" id=c_"3312.62">__p__</span> people think that the, one of the coolest things about using a computer as a recording tool is that you can just slap effects on and you don't have to go out and buy anything. It just is all there and it just works. And it sounds really great. In your case, you've made a very specific decision to focus, on using hardware effects and particularly pedals, even though you're not a guitar player, you're using, you're using pedal devices for your work. Why, why pedals and why not software? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>You know, I, I mean obviously when I first started laying out little bits of field recording, I never imagined myself buying pedals. And then, you know, being in that kind of diverse scene back in, in Brisbane, you know, there were some other guys that would use pedals in, in obscure places. I definitely would see these harsh noise guys, you know, who would literally just have a piezo pickup, right. That'd feed it into 50 pedals, scream their lungs out and turn all the pedals on for 30 seconds and then they would rip the power out of the wall and there'd be this almighty bang on the PA system and everyone would scream and be like, that's the best thing I've ever seen in my life. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>And, and you know, I can't help but say that, you know, it was kind of fun the first 10 times I saw it, but then I was like, Hey, you can probably do a bit more with those pedals <span style="color:red" data-ts="3411.08" data-end_ts="3411.3" title="3411.08" id=c_"3411.08">__and__</span> just stomp on them all. But yeah, I, I, you know, bought a few cheap, cheap, very cheap, nasty pedals to begin with and just experimented and was, you know, I quickly decided that the, some of the tones and the, the manipulation that I could achieve was definitely something I couldn't, it, it was a lot more difficult to even get close to it in, in, in the box on the computer. And don't get me wrong, I still love <span style="color:red" data-ts="3445.16" data-end_ts="3445.38" title="3445.16" id=c_"3445.16">__and__</span>, and still do, do a lot, like often my distortion might be a combination of, of DSP based distortion, either before running through analog or vice versa <span style="color:red" data-ts="3458.21" data-end_ts="3458.5" title="3458.21" id=c_"3458.21">__that__</span> I don't really have a strict, you know, signal chain where I'll be like, okay, it has to start in the box I see has, and then the last step is at the end of the analog chain, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Right. I don't get too bent outta shape about that cuz I'm, at the end of the day, I'm really going for a sound that I can hear in my own head kind of thing. And, and when I hit that spot, I just, it doesn't matter what point it is in the chain, I just, that's the, that's the spot I record. But yeah, I, I, I think, you know, as we get on in, in the on in time and we're more tied to devices, you know, laptops, computers, phones or even computers now and things like that, it's, it's really nice more than ever I like working with hardware, especially when it gets hot in Los Angeles. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>I don't want to sit in the chair. I actually like standing up. I have my sim set up on a, you know, a multi-tiered rack so I can actually just sit there and Oh, stand there. And, you know, it's, it's just much more pleasant to work in a hot environment with hardware. Do you find, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Do you find that working with hardware that you tend, and especially pedals, the pedals that you use generally don't have presets. Do you find that to be kind of an important part of the working environment that you're not, you don't have presets that you can bank on? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Yeah. I, I think that is pretty important. I mean, there's definitely been a truckload of, happy accidents, you know, where <laugh> you're patching away and manipulating away and, and you just accidentally bump something or twist something you didn't mean to, and you're like, whoa, this is, this is pretty awesome. So yeah, I don't, I, you know, I guess, if I really wanted presets, I'd probably stay in the box. But I, you know, even, even with some of the hardware things I have, like the mood little fatty, I really don't go for the presets much. I just, you know, I usually start around the organ tone or somewhere around there pretty flat base tone and then just manipulate it and just make a point. I mean, I, I do have my whole studio set up, completely wire out so that I can pretty easily with a couple of clicks, start recording anything from any source. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="3621.23" data-end_ts="3621.52" title="3621.23" id=c_"3621.23">__Okay__</span>. And that was, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3623.66" data-end_ts="3623.88" title="3623.66" id=c_"3623.66">__you__</span> know, that took me a while to configure, but it, it, it pays off. Because if you have to, you know, if you're jamming on the hardware and you find something and then you have to spend it 45 minutes, you know, running wises and the likes just to record it, it tends to, it's a bit of a buzzkill. Right. So that was something I, I definitely put a lot of time <span style="color:red" data-ts="3648.68" data-end_ts="3648.88" title="3648.68" id=c_"3648.68">__and__</span> was just getting everything, talking to everything via midi, via cv, and being able to switch between and move around quite quickly. That's, that's probably the most important thing to me in my studio, al almost more than the gear itself, is having that adaptability and versatility. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. One more question on that before we go back to the, some a little more creative discussion. What, what direction are you headed toward? So like, the last time I, I was at your place and I saw your, recording system, you had the mold pedals, you had the little fatty, you had, a couple of poly synths. What direction do you see yourself going next in terms of instrumentation or in terms of recording technique or, you know, maybe you are gonna start singing mariachi tunes. I don't know what, what, where do you see yourself going? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Yeah. You know, that, that, that's a really great question. I mean, for me, I'm, I'm definitely, I, I'm aware and I'm observing this <span style="color:red" data-ts="3723.28" data-end_ts="3723.48" title="3723.28" id=c_"3723.28">__kinda__</span> reemergence of, of kind of mid-level analog equipment, with semi kind of modular capabilities, you know, like some of the arturia stuff and Right. And I mean, that's pretty exciting, but that's, that stuff doesn't speak to me too much. I mean, I already have things like the, the roll <span style="color:red" data-ts="3743.42" data-end_ts="3743.58" title="3743.42" id=c_"3743.42">__in__</span> sh 1 0 1, which is such a, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3745.97" data-end_ts="3746.26" title="3745.97" id=c_"3745.97">__yeah__</span>, it's such a, such a cheap piece of shit. But plastic <span style="color:red" data-ts="3750.71" data-end_ts="3751.06" title="3750.71" id=c_"3750.71">__again__</span>, you know, it's so cheap made, but the sound from it not sound is 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Amazing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Yeah, I know. It's just like, I can't even believe people pay a thousand plus dollars for them these days. It blows my mind. But, you know, that sound is just, I, I, people think you're crazy, but once you hear it, you can't, you can't hear it from anything else. Right. So I, I don't have much interest in that stuff. For me, I'm more interested in building something that is definitely gonna serve me for a lot longer. So, you know, having a bunch of Moog stuff that's all five plus volts, it makes more sense for me to, to work with modular <span style="color:red" data-ts="3791" data-end_ts="3791.22" title="3791" id=c_"3791">__in__</span> environment and that's stuff <span style="color:red" data-ts="3792.46" data-end_ts="3792.58" title="3792.46" id=c_"3792.46">__Oh__</span>, sure. That's something I've been, working with and delving into more. And then as far as software goes, I, you know, there's always new daws coming out and, you know, a million zillion vsts. But for me, having Ableton Max, there's <span style="color:red" data-ts="3814.7" data-end_ts="3814.9" title="3814.7" id=c_"3814.7">__just__</span> no reason for me to go any kind of further in that environment. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Even even things like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3821.24" data-end_ts="3821.46" title="3821.24" id=c_"3821.24">__and__</span> maybe, okay, maybe stepping up the Thunderbolt audio interfaces in the future or something like that could, you know, for better recordings could make sense. But you know, that, that kind of studio <span style="color:red" data-ts="3837.37" data-end_ts="3837.66" title="3837.37" id=c_"3837.37">__wise__</span>, right now, it's just time really. It's like I just wanna spend more time, pushing those distortions and seeing sure where I can go, seeing what I can get. I mean, there's definitely still a list I have in my mind. It's huge. I've gotta try this, I've gotta try this. Oh, I haven't put this, I haven't put these kind of field recordings through these pedals yet. <laugh>, I, yeah. Those, those kind of ideas don't, don't stop. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well that's interesting because those are, those are ideas that don't start with gear, they start with a concept. Yeah. Now to kind of come all the way back around, you started off your artistically you start off as a photographer, as a visual artist. Do you still do visual artwork? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Yeah, I, I mean, I still take a lot of photos. You know, I have a digital s SLR set up and I shoot a lot on that. I shoot a lot of, video content. I shoot, you know, obviously taking photos on my phone. Everyone does that now. But, yeah, it, it's, it's, it's, I still think rather visually, and I've always kind of thought of my sound works as visual. I always think of them as kind of either large big chunks of, metal or, or right stone or something like that. But also like <span style="color:red" data-ts="3934.64" data-end_ts="3934.86" title="3934.64" id=c_"3934.64">__la__</span> you know, it sounded sonic scapes, the, the ambient tag. I, I, you know, and, and I can see definitely how some of it is ambient and it's, but I feel like ambient is such an umbrella term and, you know, it's, it's maybe a little more passive, I think when I think ambi, I think more passive than maybe what my work sounds like. Sure. And yeah, I just, the, just, I kind of draw on, I'm very influenced by different environments and, so, you know, I, I think even seasonal, I'll make more brighter puppy work in summer and darker sunnier stuff in winter. That doesn't happen so much in Los Angeles, but 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I was gonna say, I'm gonna have to invite you up to the mountains here so that you can understand what winter really is. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Oh, I know. Tasmania is pretty harsh. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, Tom, I really appreciate the time the time's flown. We've been at this for quite a while. We've talked a lot about your music and the way you do it and stuff like that. I really want people to hear it. Yeah. And I want people to, to, you know, some of the visual stuff you did, I want people to see that stuff. Give us some, give us some places to go where we can hear it. You know, maybe, maybe buy it if it's a release, whatever, help help people find your work, because Yeah, I'm really, I really want 'em to hear it. I, I am find your work really exciting. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>There's, there's my website, which is Tom Hallcom.au and then there's also, a couple of SoundCloud accounts, which I keep pretty active. There's, soundcloud.com/thole, and then there's soundcloud.com/axon. That's a <span style="color:red" data-ts="4046.26" data-end_ts="4046.46" title="4046.26" id=c_"4046.26">__double__</span> X O double N. And then there's kind of a small kind of micro label that I run, and that's synoptic, S o n O P T I k.org. And, yeah, I mean, that, that's pretty much the, the main spots that you can <span style="color:red" data-ts="4065.18" data-end_ts="4065.42" title="4065.18" id=c_"4065.18">__find__</span> it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that's fantastic. Thanks again so much for your time and for being willing to kind of dive into discussions about, I mean, really everything from Grow growing up in Tasmania, to landing in la I really appreciate, you kind of talking us through, a little bit of your artistic life. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom: </b>Yeah, thanks Darwin It's been fun. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's been good. Talk to you again soon. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that was a lot of fun. I really enjoyed talking to him. It's kind of interesting to hear from other people that grew up in rural areas and have become somehow entrenched in the arts. So that's <span style="color:red" data-ts="4110.48" data-end_ts="4110.7" title="4110.48" id=c_"4110.48">__had__</span>, that was really kind of interesting to me. But it was also fun to talk about like, what now seemed like the really old days of MySpace and trust in people that you run into on the internet, who would live by that creed anymore. Well, I hope that you trust me. So <laugh>, there's that. Thanks a lot for listening. Thanks for everyone that's helping out. We're back on the horse again now, and, so I look forward to talking to you next week. Thanks.
