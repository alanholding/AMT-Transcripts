<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today we're, going to revisit another chat with a good friend Gregory Taylor My last chat with Gregory was one of my favorite, and so I was anxious to come back to this, but also I did want him to sort of fulfill some of his promises, talk about some of the areas that he didn't talk about. But I, there were a couple of those, and so I'm going to let him sort of choose where we want to go. So, Gregory, where would you like to go? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory Taylor: </b>Well, the thing about these podcasts is people listen to them, probably far away from the circumstances that they were made. But, maybe one of the things I wanted to start with for this one, and you'll, if you're listening to this two years from now, you'll have to look it up. Darwin and I are having our chat very shortly after the death of Todd Dotter, who's, a composer and electronic musician whose work has had a really powerful effect on a lot of us. And somebody who, is really interesting in terms not only of the trajectory of his own work, but also in terms of, his relationship with kind of the larger structure of electronic music as a culture. And I think, I guess, Todd's life, thinking about Todd's life with his death is, something, I guess maybe I felt like saying something about it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Your podcast with Justin Brearley was, well, it was really moving first because generally speaking, when we do podcasts about art and technology, we don't usually talk to people whose hearts are broken, right? We don't talk about people in, in the midst of grief. And that was, I, I think, it was a really poignant discussion. But instead of, you know, talking about the, the poignancy of it, I guess the thing to say in terms of, of coming away from that is the idea of thinking of the curve of someone's work as a life's activity. I mean, most of us who make things think about, what we're making a lot of people who talk about this podcast, you know, we, we'll refer to history, but we talk about ourselves in the now. We don't really make very much reference to the fact that we've been around, for a while. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Although, I guess I wound up doing that by virtue of being shocked at being on the air for over two decades, <laugh>. But <span style="color:red" data-ts="162.45" data-end_ts="162.67" title="162.45" id=c_"162.45">__the__</span>, but Todd's passing reminded me of something that I guess I alluded a little bit too, because it's at the center of something that I've been personally interested in for a long time. And that's the idea that, your work has a sort of shape to it. And more than that, history matters. There's probably no other simpler way to say that, but Todd's death has really turned me toward thinking about that again. And so, I guess, I'd sort of like to start first by saying, how profoundly influenced by his music. I think almost all of us who do electronic music, certainly people on this podcast would certainly do that. Keith Fuller and Whitman, a couple of weeks ago in one of your earlier podcasts, spoke really movingly about who Todd was and why his work mattered to him, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>As a kind of a, a really dedicated and focused person who was an outsider. Right? And one of the things that may not be clear, I think, to a lot of younger listeners is that one of the reasons that this is a great time to be alive if you're doing electronic music, is that, we are very slowly excavating and making public the work of people who were outsiders. You know, it's, it's a truism that, that history is often written by people who are victorious. And history is also something that's given to us and received. And there are people who are either, excised from history entirely because they were the vanquished, or people who sort of get written out because they weren't, you know, insiders or things like that. And as difficult as it is for us to think about the practice of electronic music has its insiders and outsiders. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>And one of the great things about being alive now is that we have access to the work of people who were, who were outsiders. And we have the option, we have the opportunity to, to contemplate their work, to think about what they were doing, to see, in some cases, in, in the case of people who have a long history of recording behind them, to see what it looks like to follow another path. And, Todd's work just has really made me think about this. First, I'm like, everybody else, you know, I encountered, his tape music, equator, mass, that stuff. It's, and it just, I couldn't believe that it wasn't made by somebody who had access to all kinds of academic equipment because, you know, in those days, electronic music, with very few exceptions, the Dutch actually being one of them, right, was made, was made at academic institutions. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>That was where that work was done. It was kind of like research. And the idea that it was a guy with like a couple of tape recorders and a razor blade was just astounding. Especially when you listen to the work that <span style="color:red" data-ts="345.59" data-end_ts="345.81" title="345.59" id=c_"345.59">__is__</span> just fully formed, passionate, interesting, cerebral work, you think like, how did this guy do it? How did this guy do it alone? And, there's also the sense in which you have the opportunity to investigate what that path looks like in somebody else's life. And if you're somebody who, you know, tries to think about what you think with, and I think that's one of the things that, that at least I do or, or I came to realizing or deciding was important, then it's a great honor to have that kind of work to go back through and, and to, and to, and to visualize in Todd's case. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>And a lot of people talk about his earlier tape work. So I just wanna stop and say a little bit about, the work that he produced right around, and released in the late nineties turn of the century. We have this amazing body of Todd's tape work, but he has a sort of second career, and that is, starting around turn of the century. The, he put out a series of three recordings. They're all called Aerial, and they were, electronic or computer music. 'cause he'd gone to using computers by then created, by collecting and modifying shortwave radio broadcasts. There are three discs worth of material. It's an absolutely astonishing piece of work. But for 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Me, yeah, I have, I have to say that, well, they have those on Spotify. And I have to say, I've become obsessed with the aerial series. Oh, it's amazing. And, and, and somehow speaks to me in a way that so much of that kind of stuff doesn't, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Well, the reason that it, everybody's vision will be different. The reason that it does it to me, and that, I guess this is kind of, maybe this will be true for the rest of you. I never really spent a lot of time with a tape block and, and working physically with tape. We had to do it a little bit when I was in, when I was in school, but it was not really a part of my practice. But listening to that work was really moving and sobering because I think everybody who's gone anywhere near shortwave stations or FM stations mm-hmm. <affirmative> and tuned between the stations has thought, God, this stuff is, this is astounding. This is like, these are like accidental things that sound me. You know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="491.93" data-end_ts="492.13" title="491.93" id=c_"491.93">__like__</span>, so your John Cage right button, bit floats high and get stuck <laugh>. And you think, and you think, man, I could make music out of this. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Right? And then you sort of stop and you think, well, yeah, you know, I could do that. So the question is, do I wanna just like, be a Cajun proceduralist <laugh>, turn on the radio, flip the dial for five minutes, or do I really wanna like listen to the shortwave radio like every night for two hours for the next little while and find the most divine things ever? Like what great accidents are out there. Right. And a lot of you may have actually made pieces that way, but in my particular case, I sort of didn't because for me, I thought, you know, I would really be that second guy. And I thought, oh, two hours of short wave noise every night, man, that's gonna take forever <laugh>, and it's gonna hurt. It's gonna leave the mark. Oh, yeah. And listening to Todd Docs daughter's aerial work was astounding because here was a guy who had the same idea as I did, but he actually did the work to listen to that work is, is to be, unseated and moved by the fact that here was a guy who really did spend the time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>He spent hours doing it. He thought he had the same thoughts you did, but the way that he pursued it was not the way that I did. And it's, for me, one of the great things about history has to do with this idea that you can, look into, you know, you have all your friends working in the present, but history is great because you can look into the past and you can find people who are like, had the same ideas that you did in some way. Of course, they're not gonna be exactly the same 'cause times change, but, but sort of like standing on the bridge and like looking, looking at the direction of the rivers flowing, and there's somebody in a little boat out on the water, and you can just barely see 'em. It's like, it looks like <span style="color:red" data-ts="608.4" data-end_ts="608.52" title="608.4" id=c_"608.4">__a__</span>, like an old Italian guy whose face is like all beard, and he's standing in the back of the boat and, and he's been dead for 40 years. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>And he's like, looks at you, looks up at you and, and kind of smiles like he knows you. And he sort of waves and you think, oh, you know what? That would've been me uhhuh that guy would. So to me, that's why, that's what his, that's what history does. It's the possibility of, of discovering like, minds now doing that by virtue of the work that people produce, or what they write or have to say, is obviously really important to that, which means having access to that material really matters. So the great thing about being alive right now is there are tons of labels out there who are working very hard to make it possible for you to hear people who've been written out of history. Right? So, if you're an American record, person, the important record label has released a collection of, I don't know, 12, 13 CDs of Pauline Oliver's early work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And so you get to hear what it was she was doing in a really different way. 'cause it's pretty much, you know, it's not everything she did, obviously, but it's a body of work that frankly we never had a chance to hear. Important. Just did that with a reissue of some work from, a really nice and very interesting Danish composer. Elma Ripa, whose work is absolutely astounding. She's largely unknown. The deto label out of Italy has produced, released work from Teresa Zi, inchi Saatchi, the work from the new, the N p Ss group, which basically is sort of like this, well, they eventually became completely feminist performance ensemble, amazing work. <span style="color:red" data-ts="723.56" data-end_ts="723.76" title="723.56" id=c_"723.56">__Ian__</span> ADE's work, for example, we have access to mm-hmm. <affirmative>, Daphne Orum, Delia Durer, if you're Dutch <span style="color:red" data-ts="731.52" data-end_ts="731.8" title="731.52" id=c_"731.52">__tear__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="731.82" data-end_ts="732.04" title="731.82" id=c_"731.82">__to__</span> Zoan, there, there are these really interesting people. And yeah. You know what, a whole bunch of them are women, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Who got written <span style="color:red" data-ts="738.72" data-end_ts="738.8" title="738.72" id=c_"738.72">__because__</span> women were written out of history in general. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Well, yeah, absolutely. And you get to get, you get to wonder either, you get to either see why you think they got written out of history <laugh>, because they weren't doing the right kind of work. And I put the word right in quotes there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I I hear you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Or, because they didn't fit in with the institution that they were working in. They started doing different kinds of work. So, for example, they started doing work that, in the late fifties and early sixties, involved in improvisation, which real composers quote unquote, hardly ever did for whatever reason. Right. They started doing work where they got interested in doing work with children. And let's face it, Milton Babbitt didn't do a lot of work. <span style="color:red" data-ts="785.31" data-end_ts="785.6" title="785.31" id=c_"785.31">__It's__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Gonna hang out with children. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Right? No, no. So the great thing now is you get to hear all of that work. And you know what? We have astounding foremothers. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, it's funny that you mentioned that because one of <span style="color:red" data-ts="798.92" data-end_ts="799" title="798.92" id=c_"798.92">__the__</span>, when I, did the interview with, <span style="color:red" data-ts="802.13" data-end_ts="802.48" title="802.13" id=c_"802.13">__Daria__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="802.7" data-end_ts="802.92" title="802.7" id=c_"802.7">__Sen__</span> mm-hmm. <affirmative>, she talked about sort of the improvisational nature of her compositions and did so kind of in a way that almost seemed apologetic. And it's a really great point, which is that she came up through the ranks and was probably soundly beat around the head and shoulders for doing such a thing, because what proved you were a, a composer was massive amounts of documentation of the notes that would be played. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Yeah, that's exactly right. It, it val, it, it tended to privilege a certain attitude toward composition. Right? Now, we should stop at this point and say, as brutal and vicious as that is, it's also true that it's very difficult to imagine the development of electronic music without the idea that at one point in time, there were a whole bunch of composers who had this idea that, specifying everything about a piece of music, being able to control and specify everything about it precisely was the goal of composition. Right? Right. Because without that, there's a whole lot of stuff about the development of electronic music that we don't get. But the history itself is actually wider, is actually kind of wider and cooler. I mean, you know, here's, here's a kind of difference. When I was, when I was in my twenties, if you studied anything about electronic music, you learned, let me think. What did you, this is gonna be a little bit clumsy, and if there are any people who teach the history of electronic music out there, they 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Can come and yell at you, huh? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>That's exactly right. Please come and yell at me the next time we see each other <laugh>. But my distinct memory of it is electronic music, in Europe happened in only two places. It happened in Paris, and it happened in, at <span style="color:red" data-ts="909.64" data-end_ts="909.88" title="909.64" id=c_"909.64">__Vest__</span> Deutscher audio in Cologne. And they were two wildly different groups of music, because one of them was a whole bunch of Germans who basically were atonal surrealists who attempted to specify, all musical behavior moving from Hebert Iert on forward, and, culminating in algorithmic com, compositional projects like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="928.6" data-end_ts="929.04" title="928.6" id=c_"928.6">__Godfried__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="929.25" data-end_ts="929.6" title="929.25" id=c_"929.25">__Micka__</span> and s Project one. And then there were the French who were doing things with like turntables and thinking of recordings of things as concrete objects that could be manipulated. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And, and oh, yeah, there were a couple of Americans who hoed around with tape music, and then there were Americans who decided they wanted to do that kind of specification. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>So the Columbia, Princeton Electronic Music Center happened, then there were a bunch of hippies in San Francisco. So that history is kind of gives you the idea that it's only, it only happens in very few places, and it only happens with a very few people. It turns out that history is, is unnecessarily reductive. There are, one thing about them that is true, however, and you run into this once you start listening more broadly, is that in the early days, you were working with equipment that was really expensive. Right. And the only way to be able to afford it in almost every case, was to have a <span style="color:red" data-ts="989.16" data-end_ts="989.24" title="989.16" id=c_"989.16">__cent__</span> a center, not only of what we would now think of as cultural capital, but also, intellectual capital. So you could, you could have, you know, technicians and guys who actually owned and bought tape machines. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Now, before we, before we go on, I, I do want to talk a little bit about this reductive nature of history, because I couldn't agree with you more. I <laugh> literally just before, I got on the horn with you, I was watching on Netflix. I was watching the Greenwich Village, documentary, and the Greenwich Village documentary pretty much makes it clear that from this person's perspective, folk music was born and, matured and, and came to being as a result of the environment in Greenwich Village. And, you know, being a, being a kid from the lumber towns of the great white north, I feel definitely like, that's, you know, crazy. That's crazy. It's crazy, right? But in, in this <span style="color:red" data-ts="1063.24" data-end_ts="1063.48" title="1063.24" id=c_"1063.24">__date__</span>, it, it seems like what's what's happening right now, we've gone from history being defined by the academic history books for whatever area you're into to now being, the history is defined by whatever a documentarian decides to make a movie about. Right? Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Well, it's a slightly better, it's a slightly better system. I mean, havings of documentary filmmakers, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>A little more democratic maybe, but 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Yeah, exactly. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1092.58" data-end_ts="1092.8" title="1092.58" id=c_"1092.58">__And__</span> I mean, it's a little bit more like having the new music distribution service for electronic and experimental music in the late 1970s. It's kind of like, yeah, they're kind of a little bit weirded off the wall and singular in their own way, but at least, at least they're something it's least it's not, you know, all we have is Columbia Records. Right, right. Which is, which by the way, was a great source for experimental music because they hired David Berryman in the late sixties for reasons I don't understand <laugh>. That's why we have Harry Parks's, how we got, Terry Reilly. It's how we got, yeah. That's why that stuff happened. So even big companies sometimes by exited do cool 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Stuff. Right. But, so anyway, I just did want to kind of throw that point out there because you know, what I'm hoping for is like the, the documentary of, like the, the little electronic music scene I out of Ida or Iowa City, for 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Example. Yeah, that would be, that would be totally, well, okay. So I'll tell you about one, I'll tell you about one story that I sort of know, and I sort of know it because, I was lucky enough to live in the Netherlands. I have a terrible reading knowledge of Dutch. My spoken Dutch is even worse, but I can follow it. So, here's an interesting history and, the good news about the history is, it's, is it okay if I, say something about a book? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, you can even, you can even curse. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1180.33" data-end_ts="1180.68" title="1180.33" id=c_"1180.33">__Sorry__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b><laugh>. Oh, okay. Well, I generally, I generally don't. Okay. So for those of you who are listening to this and thinking, this might, this discussion might not be a waste of my time, I have a book for you to read. The book is written by a guy named <span style="color:red" data-ts="1194.55" data-end_ts="1194.84" title="1194.55" id=c_"1194.55">__Case__</span> Zellar, T A Z E L A A R. Yes, that's right. He's Dutch. The book is called On the Threshold of Beauty Phillips, and the Origins of Electronic Music in the Netherlands, 1925 to 1965. It's a fantastic book. There are a couple of reasons you might wanna read the book. If, you're at all interested in the Philips booth at the World's Fair in Brussels Right. And the piece of music that Edgar EZ wrote for it, then you absolutely should read that book because a discussion about how that thing came into being and how it was the technical details of its doing, it's all in there. But it's an awesome story because Case also tells you the story about the fights that were behind it and stuff like that. So, for example, did you know that the, I believe the first person they approached about making music for the, for the Phillips Pavilion was Benjamin Britton. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Really? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Yes. That's, yeah. I think it's Benjamin Britton. Anyway, somebody you would never expect, the idea being that, the young person's guide to the orchestra, I think it was Bri. But anyway, they approached somebody else, and when they got to ez, he said, yeah, I'll do it, but only under a certain, a couple of, oh, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1279.08" data-end_ts="1279.28" title="1279.08" id=c_"1279.08">__the__</span> Corbusier designed the building, and Corbusier said, okay, I'll do it, but if I build this building for you, I want you to use Edgar EZ as the composer to do the music in this building. And the Dutch were like, who is this guy? We didn't know anything about him. <laugh> is he real composer? And there's this whole negotiation about like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1300.42" data-end_ts="1300.64" title="1300.42" id=c_"1300.42">__oh__</span>, do we really wanna do this? And then they listened to his music, and some of them came back and said, oh, this is too weird. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>People are gonna really hate this. What are we gonna do? So there's this whole negotiation, and Talar actually has the whole story in there. And it's absolutely fascinating because when we think of the music for the, for the Phillips Pavilion in Brussels, we think of it as like a really revolutionary event, fixed thing. And we don't think of it as a whole bunch of people fighting about stuff. Right. Right. And that story is in there, including, and here's the great thing. They were so concerned that it wasn't gonna work out that they had a second person standing by 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, the backup plan. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Yeah. There was a backup <span style="color:red" data-ts="1345.75" data-end_ts="1346.04" title="1345.75" id=c_"1345.75">__that__</span> was a backup guy who was gonna do the stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh my God. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>And like, literally almost up to the last minute, it's an astounding story. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's amazing. Because there again, you know, so you would, you would catch some of the, the public view of this story, like in that book, the rest is noise, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Oh, yeah, absolutely. Yep. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And you get, you get a sense of really smart people made a wonderful decision that just worked out fabulously. Yeah. You 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Know what, <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>The real story, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The real story is, is 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Even cooler. <laugh>. The other thing that case does that I think is just absolutely Godlike, is he spends a lot of time talking about the technical challenges of doing it. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, I mean, you hear that piece of music and Case actually tells you how it's done and how, and what kinds of technical solutions had to be, people had to come up with to do it right. At Phillips, because they had to, it, it, it was not only a new piece, but it was basically a completely different way of presenting stuff. There were these discussions about like what the visual material that would go with it. With, okay. So that's one great reason to read the other, to read the book. The other reason to read the book is that cases has done something that if you study in the Netherlands, you kind of know this, if you have a really good electronic music teacher, you kind of know this. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>But most people don't. And that is, there's something really interesting about electronic music practice in the Netherlands, and here's what it is. If you buy the narrative that electronic music in Europe happens in two places, only two places, this is the clumsy reductionist version. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, even if you buy that idea, there's something that probably hasn't occurred to you. And that is who made the gear, right. That people use to make the pieces. And the short answer is, quite often it's Phillips, right? The Dutch electronics firm, Phillips, as a company actually had a bunch of people that worked on building equipment for early practitioners of electronic tape music. And more than that, Phillips was a company, I don't know if they still do this, but they were, they kind of, they kind of did it. But, Phillips tended to hire engineers very young. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>They, they had feeder schools like the technical university at Delft. And very often, like good engineers would be hired from Delft straight to Phillips. They'd worked for Phillips their entire lives on various projects. And Phillips was a, you know, pretty big company. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. So that, so there was this idea at some point where people at Phillips decide to say, you know, this electronic technology stuff, there's some real product opportunities here. We should be thinking about doing this. And so they set up these like little skunk works projects that would do things like, the diffusion of, recorded performance. So like, instead of thinking about like, just a single speaker, what about multiple speaker arrays and how could we make new, so they were actually working on some really interesting stuff when electronic tape music showed up, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1533.81" data-end_ts="1534.16" title="1533.81" id=c_"1533.81">__right__</span>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1534.16" data-end_ts="1534.36" title="1534.16" id=c_"1534.16">__And__</span> it didn't come out of the blue, but it sort of showed up and they wound up building gear. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Not just that, but the people who built the gear would often be kind of, they were skunkwork guys. They weren't, you know, it's, it's wrong to say they were pariahs within the firm, but, but the, the working group tended to attract, certain kinds of people who did interesting stuff. And in many cases, those engineers were assigned to work as assistants for other composers, or to create stuff to be installed in these, the, the big, quote unquote electronic music centers. Well, it turns out, if you look at some of the early composers of electronic tape music in the Netherlands, you do in fact find composers who are part of that whole, Germanic let's specify everything stuff. But the interesting thing about it is, some of them are technolo or technicians from Phillips <laugh>. Oh, interesting. They're the guys who build the gear, and they start horsing around with the gear and saying, well, you know, you could actually, I could, you could do this. Right? Yeah. And the other thing that, that some of them do, it's not very many of them, but there are two guys in particular, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1604.32" data-end_ts="1604.44" title="1604.32" id=c_"1604.32">__y__</span> Boman and a guy named Dick ACHs, who's probably better known than <span style="color:red" data-ts="1607.68" data-end_ts="1607.84" title="1607.68" id=c_"1607.68">__Jan__</span> Borman, who pretty much, get enough gear to, set up their own private studios. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>So, one of the really famous ones is <span style="color:red" data-ts="1619.94" data-end_ts="1620.16" title="1619.94" id=c_"1619.94">__Jan__</span> Borman and Dick, who build their own little studio in, in the city of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1624.63" data-end_ts="1624.92" title="1624.63" id=c_"1624.63">__Uche__</span>, which is sort of like, you can walk by it today, I think, I don't even know who lives in it, but it's, you know, everybody knows where it is. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And the idea is they had their own studio. So in, so if you wanted to work 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Like the beginning of the project studio movement. Exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>If you wanted to work at West Dutch <span style="color:red" data-ts="1640.57" data-end_ts="1640.92" title="1640.57" id=c_"1640.57">__Radio__</span> in Germany, or if you wanted to work in, in Paris, you had to be a certain kind of composer, right? They let students in who maybe weren't that kind of composer and let them of course, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1650.98" data-end_ts="1651.2" title="1650.98" id=c_"1650.98">__run__</span> with material, but to really do the work. Whereas these Dutch guys, like <span style="color:red" data-ts="1655.16" data-end_ts="1655.44" title="1655.16" id=c_"1655.16">__Young__</span> Boman is a really interesting guy. He had his own studio for years and years and years. The, the, the Dutch label near has a box set of all of his where it's like, I don't know, 10 CDs. And what you get to hear when you do that is what you get to do when you have the studio space entirely to yourself. There's no pressure. There's nobody sitting around telling you what you're supposed to do. What do you do? How do you, how does that change the craft that you have? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>That's one of the other things that Talar gets to talk about. So I would've said, if we'd had this conversation five or 10 years ago, I would've said, you know, there's a lot of really cool, interesting ideas about electronic music practice in the Netherlands that's sort of like every Dutch person who does that kind of knows about. And for some reason, they don't bother to tell other people <laugh>. And it remains an interesting secret. Right. And in my case, really is like, until I was in school, I suddenly realized that like everybody in my class knew stuff I didn't know. And that's what they knew. And I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1720.08" data-end_ts="1720.16" title="1720.08" id=c_"1720.08">__would__</span>, I would just like come back to the United States and say, you guys, you guys, you won't believe it. There, there <span style="color:red" data-ts="1724.68" data-end_ts="1724.76" title="1724.68" id=c_"1724.68">__are__</span> these like Dutch composers who were like, technicians who built gear for other people and then decided to make their own stuff. Isn't that awesome? And everybody would say, what? <laugh>, except, and you'd go back to my Dutch friends and I'd say, why don't you tell people about this? Right. This is an astounding story. It explains so much stuff about how some of this work, how 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Things work. Yeah. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Well, let us all raise our foaming glass of beverage and, and praise case lar, for actually writing the stuff down. I think there's another book to be <span style="color:red" data-ts="1754.6" data-end_ts="1754.8" title="1754.6" id=c_"1754.6">__written__</span>, to be written for the period after, after 1965, because of course, there's political upheaval and, Stein happens when a big piece of art is funded. And Well, anyway, that's, that's another story. That's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Another story for another podcast. But now when you talk about, going to school and learning this stuff and then coming back to the us is this when you were at Sonology? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Yeah, it was, it was. Okay. My wife got a, my wife received Fulbright, and we pretty much wound up moving to the city of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1787.5" data-end_ts="1787.72" title="1787.5" id=c_"1787.5">__Ure__</span>. It because that's where she was gonna do her work. And since I'm an idiot, I thought, the Institute for Sonology <span style="color:red" data-ts="1795.9" data-end_ts="1796.12" title="1795.9" id=c_"1795.9">__and__</span> the city of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1796.44" data-end_ts="1796.68" title="1796.44" id=c_"1796.44">__Urich__</span>, this'll be awesome. I can go visit, maybe I can even go there or something like that. Well, of course, what I didn't realize is in <span style="color:red" data-ts="1803.16" data-end_ts="1803.44" title="1803.16" id=c_"1803.16">__nine__</span>, the late 1980s, 86 or 87, they'd actually moved from the city of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1808.56" data-end_ts="1808.88" title="1808.56" id=c_"1808.56">__Urich__</span> to the Hague. Oh, okay. My memory of it is that the program got traded to the Royal Conservatory in, the quid Pro <span style="color:red" data-ts="1817.16" data-end_ts="1817.4" title="1817.16" id=c_"1817.16">__Coal__</span> was for, it was something like Baroque performance or swap a draft 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Choice to be named later. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Yeah. Yeah, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1824.12" data-end_ts="1824.52" title="1824.12" id=c_"1824.12">__exactly__</span>. Well, it sounds like the, the draft, but that's how they, that's how they do curriculum in those days. That's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. Well, so, they're 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>In The Hague. So they're in The Hague. So I think I'm going to the Netherlands. I'll, let's see if I can get in. So I, so <span style="color:red" data-ts="1840.2" data-end_ts="1840.44" title="1840.2" id=c_"1840.2">__where__</span>, while we're on a visit, I, I call up a guy who turned out to be one of my teachers later, Paul Bair, who said, well, I live in <span style="color:red" data-ts="1847.28" data-end_ts="1847.44" title="1847.28" id=c_"1847.28">__this__</span> church. We can get together and, and have some coffee or a drink and talk a little bit. And I thought, this will be great. I get to talk to a famous Sonologist <laugh>, because of course, I knew his work as an algorithmic composer. He's, he's one of the men, he's one of the guys. I thought, this will be great. I can read this famous guy. I didn't realize he was American. You know, I didn't know any of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1865.56" data-end_ts="1865.64" title="1865.56" id=c_"1865.56">__this__</span> stuff. So I have a drink with him. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>And I went into it thinking, this is either gonna be the best thing, or it'll be the worst thing in my life. 'cause I thought, well, if I do wanna do anything at Sonology, like what if I go in and they like, screw it up, reach into the piano bench and pull out, a Chopan <span style="color:red" data-ts="1884.88" data-end_ts="1885" title="1884.88" id=c_"1884.88">__a__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1885" data-end_ts="1885.2" title="1885" id=c_"1885">__two__</span> and put it on the key, put it on the music, stand upside down and say, sight read this and transpose it a minor third. Right. If they do that, I'm boned. It's over. Right, right. But instead, he was great. He was cordial, he was really interesting. We spent a lot of time talking about Indonesian music, which I've loved and studied for a long time. And he sort of thought, yeah, this, yeah, it would be really neat to have somebody in the program who knows what, you know. And I thought, well, this is great, so I'll go. So I had the choice at the time of invol of like enrolling in a, you know, a language program and, and actually learning to speak Dutch really well, or going to Sonology. And while I've occasionally felt like, well, maybe if I'd learned Dutch better earlier on, I'd be a lot better at Dutch now because I'd suck at it. But instead going to Sonology just, changed my life. So, and so we went, I went in. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm, I'm curious you, for those of you who are listening who don't know, who don't know Gregory, personally, Gregory is a big fan of kind of all things Dutch. Were you a big, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Well, my wife is Dutch. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that helps, doesn't it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>I'm married, I'm married into the culture. You 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Married into it. So, but my question is, were you, were you into it prior to going over there? Or was that's a good, that something that's developed while you were, there's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>No, a lot of it had to do, A lot of it had to do with Yolanda. But, one of the things about, one of the things about my interest at the time in electronic music was that, that if you did anything <span style="color:red" data-ts="1981.52" data-end_ts="1981.8" title="1981.52" id=c_"1981.52">__other__</span>, if you knew about anything other than, programs like, west <span style="color:red" data-ts="1987.12" data-end_ts="1987.48" title="1987.12" id=c_"1987.12">__<inaudible>__</span> or the g r m guys in Paris, then you knew about a couple of other outlier places. And one of the places that you absolutely knew about was the Institute of Sonology. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Part of the reason for that was that, they were really, instrumental in a couple of shifts in electronic music practice, in the 19, in the 1970s and 1980s. So one of the things that they were really very well known for at the time was algorithmic composition. They were, they, they really kept a real focus on that kind of stuff. And a number of their students came to the United States, which is of course, the way that we know about it. So people like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2026.26" data-end_ts="2026.48" title="2026.26" id=c_"2026.26">__KT__</span> Lippy, Robert Rowe, Barry Truax there, you know, there are a number of composers who were educated there who brought those interests back. And so if you, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, alright. That's interesting to me because you're helping me connect some dots, because one of the problems is you say, you know, things like, and this is how we know about Sonology today, but I have to admit that Sonology has done a very good job of hiding its light under a bushel <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Right. That's partially, that <span style="color:red" data-ts="2056.4" data-end_ts="2056.6" title="2056.4" id=c_"2056.4">__may__</span> be because they're Dutch, basically. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, maybe, maybe it is, but I mean, so can you give us a little history about where they even come from? Yeah, sure. But to hear that people like Robert Rohr are coming to the US out of that program. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2068.7" data-end_ts="2068.92" title="2068.7" id=c_"2068.7">__Yep__</span>. I didn't realize that. That's stunning. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Well, there's a lot of stuff about, particularly about algorithmic practice, and also some of the early experiments in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data">PD</a>P 11 are all sonology stuff. So basically, there's a studio for electronic music at the Phillips Research Laboratories in the city of Eind Hova, which is sort of, in those days was kind of a factory town for Phillips. Okay. And then starting in the 1960s, there was a studio founded at the University of, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2095.6" data-end_ts="2095.68" title="2095.6" id=c_"2095.6">__we__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2095.68" data-end_ts="2095.88" title="2095.68" id=c_"2095.68">__checked__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2096.34" data-end_ts="2096.56" title="2096.34" id=c_"2096.34">__so__</span> right around the turn of the sixties, that was called the Studio for Electronic Music, which I think was STEM or something. It had an algorithm anyway. And in, and that was essentially run by a pretty well-known composer at the time, German guy, Godfried Mik, who did a lot of work on algorithmic composition. Those of you who read electronic music history will probably recognize, his, function pieces. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>They're all color functions, so like <span style="color:red" data-ts="2128.38" data-end_ts="2128.6" title="2128.38" id=c_"2128.38">__ion__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2129.43" data-end_ts="2129.72" title="2129.43" id=c_"2129.43">__blah__</span> or stuff. There's a bunch of those pieces. And he also invented a program, a program to do 12 tone serialization called Project One. That's really famous. Oh, yes. So, that, that, that old studio turned into the Institute of Sonology, and a number of people who were working there at the time were really instrumental in the switch from analog to digitally specified music. Now, again, that was one of those things that required money because you had to be able to buy things like a P D P 15, which is a very old kind of computer, which has half the memory of your laptop. Right. On <span style="color:red" data-ts="2168.76" data-end_ts="2168.92" title="2168.76" id=c_"2168.76">__an__</span> so <span style="color:red" data-ts="2169.5" data-end_ts="2169.72" title="2169.5" id=c_"2169.5">__let__</span>, we'll avoid <span style="color:red" data-ts="2170.2" data-end_ts="2170.32" title="2170.2" id=c_"2170.2">__the__</span>, what was the size of your basement? Yeah, exactly. Well, a very, very large icebox. Right. And so in those days, we have, a lot of people who basically turn to using, digital computers to do compositional algorithms. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>And that's where we get, not just algorithms, but also the sound of work as well. So, for those of you who know what vSim is, it's a way of, of simulating vocal track stuff that work, is done at the Institute of Sonology by Vener <span style="color:red" data-ts="2202.38" data-end_ts="2202.6" title="2202.38" id=c_"2202.38">__Kee__</span>. There's a bunch of work with, some of the early work with, granular synthesis and sort of thinking of granular synthesis as a way to organize musical behavior. Not just sound, but compositions itself that shows up at the time. Barry Truax is there with, what he called at the time, his pod system. Paul <span style="color:red" data-ts="2222.08" data-end_ts="2222.48" title="2222.08" id=c_"2222.08">__Barrick__</span> wrote a system that did, algorithmic stuff called <span style="color:red" data-ts="2225.51" data-end_ts="2225.8" title="2225.51" id=c_"2225.51">__Pile__</span>, and then in the late, so that sort of continues. So Sonology is really interesting to me at the time as a student, because it had not only, you know, not only could you could you work on things like Atari systems do digital stuff, but it also had, and still has one of the most kick ass analog tape studios in the universe. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Full stop. It's really, it, it's really, really beautiful. Johan <span style="color:red" data-ts="2258.36" data-end_ts="2258.56" title="2258.36" id=c_"2258.36">__fun__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2258.62" data-end_ts="2258.84" title="2258.62" id=c_"2258.62">__cry__</span> still, keeps it up as a, a loving thing. The last time I was in the Netherlands, I went to visit him. And, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2267.55" data-end_ts="2267.84" title="2267.55" id=c_"2267.55">__that__</span>, I don't wanna say my eyes, eyes filled with tears when I walked back into that room, but it's just an absolutely ex exquisite analog studio. And in some respects, it ruined me up until the return of the boutique analog, it ruined me because it was so astoundingly well done. Right. So anyway, that went to the Royal Conservatory at The Hague. And, you know, currently, I guess they, they have a number of projects ongoing, but they're still, I think, really, really well known for things like, algorithmic composition. They were also really involved early on, on the idea of live electronic music mm-hmm. <affirmative> and with, case Talar, taking over the program. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>They're also, kind of really interested in, reconstructions of electronic and computer music as well, because Case has a real, has a real, I guess we would say, burden on his heart for the history of the field. So he's also responsible for bringing us, the Tom Disbel, Dick and Imas stuff, music from Outer space making, you know, bringing that stuff back to us because he was really, he's really involved in that. And, so there's like, there's like the standard one year sonology course, they have bachelor's and master's. And Sonology is interesting because it's one of those things that people went to and studied and very often would return back to the United States and bring the gospel of algorithmic com, composition back with them. And, you know, Sonology, like a lot of European schools was kind of, you know, into the European High modernism thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>But, I think they were kind of interesting to me also because their high modernism was also covered pretty strongly by, the social revolutions of the sixties and early seventies as well. So it wasn't just that you'd have, composers whose work was informed by, was informed by all kinds of politics. Conrad, er being of course, one of the big guys like that Dick Imas, same thing. And they were really, you know, so when you went to Sonology, so <span style="color:red" data-ts="2392.28" data-end_ts="2392.4" title="2392.28" id=c_"2392.28">__I__</span>, you know, I'll just, I'll think about my coursework. When you went to Sonology, you learned digital signal processing with Stan Templars. You spent time learning, forth with Joel Ryan <laugh>. You learned, you learned lisp from Paul Berg. You spent time in the analog studio, but you also read Pierre Boles. You read Jacque Ali's, work noise. If you were lucky enough to have a little Dutch, you took lessons with Dick Imas, which was probably one of the luckiest things that ever happened to me while I was there. And it was a really unusual program in that it combined, you know, digital analog, live performance, algorithmic stuff, and, some really, informed theoretical, theoretical stuff. It's a great, it was a great program. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, but it also sounds, what's, what's interesting is going back to what you were talking about earlier, it also seems to a place to be, a place that actually valued history, rather than being in a rush to chuck it out the window. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>I suppose it's possible that, you know, the thing to remember about this is I'm older than the average student at the time. So for all I know, they didn't, oh, they didn't care. <laugh>, you know, they didn't care a bit. It could be okay. Now, the people that have since become my close friends did, I mean, their engagement was, you know, that they had like a great tape library. So, you know, like three days a week I would spend my lunchtime, I would have my little half cheese sandwich, and I would like kill that off in three minutes. And then I'd go upstairs and I would listen to everything I could get my hands on, including like, crap loads of radio performances and live stuff that was never, ever released. And it was just all there. You just go in and show <span style="color:red" data-ts="2500.64" data-end_ts="2500.76" title="2500.64" id=c_"2500.64">__me__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2500.76" data-end_ts="2500.88" title="2500.76" id=c_"2500.76">__a__</span> little student card, and that would be, you'd spend an hour with that. So for me, that's when, that's when I listened to everything I could get my hands on. Do, do I, did everybody else do that? I have no idea. Do I know that some of my, classmates who have since become my friends Justin Bennett, Wolf, do I know those guys did it? Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. Because 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>They were rushing through their GS sandwich as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Well, probably, or they were in the, they were in the library at different times. Right, right. 'cause they, you know, but there were people that <span style="color:red" data-ts="2533.68" data-end_ts="2533.88" title="2533.68" id=c_"2533.68">__clear__</span>, there were people that clearly did it. And again, you know, not to put too fine a point on it, there's a real sense in which I would occasionally be sitting in my, you know, sitting at my, in my little desk taking notes and thinking like, you know, this is the guy that implemented vSim stuff. Right. This is Stan Temp. This is not just like my teacher. This is like Stan Templars, this like, Anem, an embodiment Boy, this sounds Daffy, sorry about this. He's an embodiment of wisdom. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure.

<b>Gregory: </b>'cause makes sense. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2568.16" data-end_ts="2568.28" title="2568.16" id=c_"2568.16">__Sense__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2568.28" data-end_ts="2568.6" title="2568.28" id=c_"2568.28">__because__</span> you know, if you, if you grow up somewhere else, your idea is like art is mediated to you by objects, things in books or facts in books, and you just don't always think about the idea that those are the products of people. And, you know, that's, so to me, the thing about, the thing, the thing about Justin <span style="color:red" data-ts="2587.66" data-end_ts="2588.08" title="2587.66" id=c_"2587.66">__Burley__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2588.08" data-end_ts="2588.2" title="2588.08" id=c_"2588.08">__the__</span> thing about Todd Doto was I felt like I knew something about him. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah. He was as a person, guy, a person, a man who instantiated like all of this stuff. And the fact of the matter is, he doesn't merely reduce to his ideas. That's the other thing. He's a person. Right. And for me, being a Sonology was like, you know, I knew who Paul Berg was, but I didn't, I would just sit in that class and I would think, this is Paul Berg. This is Stan Templars. This is like Joel Ryan, that guy that did that <span style="color:red" data-ts="2621.34" data-end_ts="2621.56" title="2621.34" id=c_"2621.34">__in__</span> possibly cool number readers piece with the Hall effect sensors on his fingers. Holy Moses. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2627.58" data-end_ts="2627.8" title="2627.58" id=c_"2627.58">__And__</span>, and, and now of course, I think about Dick <span style="color:red" data-ts="2631.5" data-end_ts="2631.72" title="2631.5" id=c_"2631.5">__ERs__</span> that way, right. Because in fact, when I was sitting in Dick's class, I was like, do I really know what that word means in Dutch? Oh gosh. I was running as hard as I could linguistically to keep up, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Just to keep up. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>But I, you know, I, I studied with those guys, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So that's, that, that helps me a lot understand more about what the environment was, because again, they have done a good job of hiding what they do and their influence on the world. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>They're going, they're going about their work. Yeah. Yeah. You know, that's the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2663.24" data-end_ts="2663.48" title="2663.24" id=c_"2663.24">__deal__</span>. It's, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>There are people who are not, yeah. There are people who are like endlessly self-promoting, and then there are people who like just sit down, buckle down and do, and do the hard work. And frankly, we live in a culture that doesn't value, well just ask any woman. We live in a culture that doesn't value enablers. Right. You know, we inval we value people that make stuff and talk really loudly about it, other than people who like do the hard work and the heavy lifting and sonology, my experience at Sonology might be really different than other people's, but my experience there was that there was a fantastic bunch of people and really complicated people who are available to you, who would take you seriously. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Now you had, you know, they weren't going to sort of give you everything. You had to actually show interest and work hard and frankly put up with having them argue with you and stuff like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>But if you were willing to do that, there was, it was an astounding experience. And I'm sure there are other great programs throughout the world. So those of you who are, any of those of you may be educators. I'm sure you're doing a great job. And I'll bet that at some point in the future, there will be somebody on a podcast somewhere who talks to up to about you, like, I'm talking about them, but I, I owe those, I owe those people a debt I can never repay. Right. Yeah. I really do. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So kind of coming back around, to, to some of the discussion we were having about, about Todd's work. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2760.4" data-end_ts="2760.56" title="2760.4" id=c_"2760.4">__How__</span> do, how do outsiders fit in? So, I mean, nominally the Dutch electronic music world was outsider, but it was still a whole lot more insider than a lot of other people doing a lot of other kinds of work. Now we've seen places where outsider work has gotten recognition, I would think primarily of the West Coast people. Absolutely. Who were definitely outsiders, but ended up finding their place in history. Sure. Some, because what they did was documented and some because of their influence on what became popular culture. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>That's very true. Well, the San Francisco Tape Music Center is not an academic enterprise. Right. In that sense. So there are places, there are, or were places, or the Harvest <span style="color:red" data-ts="2808.53" data-end_ts="2808.88" title="2808.53" id=c_"2808.53">__works__</span>. People in New York, back in the early days, same thing. Not an academic enterprise. So there were local initiatives that did that, did that kind of work. Right. Todd's thing was, a man who was a, a man with the chops, and by virtue of his work at Gotham Recording Studios was able to acquire the, the necessary skills and have access to the equipment to do the work that he needed to do. And, and in, in his case, given, how creative and self-directive he was, he was able to realize astounding work that way. Most of us probably have to work, inside systems. Right now that's in, that's far less, that's far less true now. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Definitely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>But, you know, and those systems, when we talk about that period in the sixties, those systems are not all western systems. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I was just gonna ask, where are some other places, particularly places that are off the beaten path, meaning the beaten path of people who fly between New York and Frankfurt and then take a one hour train ride? Right. But, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>In the case of, in the case of Intermedia work, some of those are going to be, are going to be accidents, accidents of propinquity closeness. So for example, if we think about, if we think about a place like, Wesleyan University is a really good example. A relatively small liberal arts college. Has some really, has produced some really interesting performers and work, first because they had interesting intelligent people working there, but <span style="color:red" data-ts="2903.02" data-end_ts="2903.24" title="2903.02" id=c_"2903.02">__in__</span>, but also because there's a center for world music and there's also a bunch of electronic musicians. So the possibility that they might randomly collide, would be, was high. Was high. And those, and and also, here's the other thing to say about it, they might randomly collide with people who did not view their particular practice as insular. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Right. So there are, there are great world music teachers who feel that it's their primary responsibility to mediate, the whole of a cultural practice. And in situations when you feel like your responsibility is to protect its history, however you understand that term, the the business of working between the lines becomes a little bit complicated. That's not true of everyone. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Right. So, for example, you know, Lamont Young and Terry Riley heard a bunch of Indian stuff, and they convinced pun, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2967.61" data-end_ts="2967.96" title="2967.61" id=c_"2967.61">__prath__</span> to come to live with them and study with them as a teacher. It's really difficult to fully assess the extent to which, that changed the co the course of, American Avantgarde work, because clearly it's not just limited to, Lamont Young and Terry Riley to who's better known students. Right. There are a number of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2989.2" data-end_ts="2989.32" title="2989.2" id=c_"2989.2">__other__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2989.92" data-end_ts="2990.32" title="2989.92" id=c_"2989.92">__Christopher__</span> Hens, for example, who did some, who's done doing and has done some great work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>There's a lot of people who did that. But there's this sort of notion where one of the outsider sources is various kinds of non-Western music. Steve Reisch went to study, Ghanaian drumming and wound up, you know, sort of taking what is a kind of communal practice, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3014.02" data-end_ts="3014.31" title="3014.02" id=c_"3014.02">__this__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3014.51" data-end_ts="3014.71" title="3014.51" id=c_"3014.51">__presence__</span> of drumming and to basically isolate certain kinds of, of phase <span style="color:red" data-ts="3019.28" data-end_ts="3019.63" title="3019.28" id=c_"3019.28">__based__</span> patterns and basically apply them to someplace else. In the case of <span style="color:red" data-ts="3024.88" data-end_ts="3025.23" title="3024.88" id=c_"3024.88">__prana__</span>, this idea of like Indian music, in the case of Indonesian stuff, the idea that Indonesian music by its form and structure is essentially cyclical. That there's this idea that you have, an underlying structure which is then, elaborated at different timescales over the top of it. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="3044.12" data-end_ts="3044.32" title="3044.12" id=c_"3044.12">__this__</span> sort of resulting hydroponic stuff is the piece, the case of Japanese work. We have this, or, or the work of Korea certainly as well, or China, we have, traditions where sort of timur works different or the focus is on different kinds of physical practice. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, you know, those things all have also fed, I think, various forms of electronic music practice. And you can certainly find composers in all of those areas. The question is how did they pick up what they needed? You know, because Sure. There the world's full of people who say, like, my work is based on, the, wedding music in, Azerbaijan. Well, it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="3091.08" data-end_ts="3091.24" title="3091.08" id=c_"3091.08">__kinda__</span>, well, the world's not actually full of those people <laugh>. Yeah. Well, there's gonna be people who do that. Right. And, and the fact of the matter is they listened to an Azerbaijani record once and then went off and decided they knew what the thing was. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3102.08" data-end_ts="3102.36" title="3102.08" id=c_"3102.08">__Interesting__</span>. Right. But the truth is, there are other people who sort of work between those cultural traditions and try and, and whose primary anxiety isn't that they're working in the cultural tradition, but they are trying to be both properly faithful and <span style="color:red" data-ts="3116.18" data-end_ts="3116.4" title="3116.18" id=c_"3116.18">__to__</span> still do work. That's, that's their own. And in some respects, one of the great gifts from non-Western music as an outsider discourse is it's given us different ways to think about structuring music. Let me <span style="color:red" data-ts="3134.56" data-end_ts="3134.72" title="3134.56" id=c_"3134.56">__think__</span>, let me think of sort of, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3136.98" data-end_ts="3137.2" title="3136.98" id=c_"3136.98">__oh__</span>, okay. This is as non nerdy as I can be about it, and I will sing the praises of Indian music for a minute. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Indian music is, not <span style="color:red" data-ts="3148.06" data-end_ts="3148.28" title="3148.06" id=c_"3148.06">__my__</span>, is not a single discourse. There's kinetic stuff, there's hindustani stuff, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3152.04" data-end_ts="3152.2" title="3152.04" id=c_"3152.04">__the__</span> work that which vary, their practitioners would say that they vary really widely, but they have something in common that I've always been a little puzzle as to why electronic musicians don't pay more attention to, and it, it works like this. One of the things that's complicated about Indian music is the idea of a rock, because it's, it's a little difficult to nail down. And the simple thing that'll probably have people throwing ripe fruit at me would be to say something like this, if you think of in western music what you think of as a mode on one end of a line, and you think a tune on the other end, then the rock lives along that line. It's not a mode, it's not just a tune. It's this other thing that's lives between those. Okay. So that's, that's the hard part. But here's the cool part. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>A raga always explains itself to anybody who's willing to listen. And its structure works like this. There's a sort of an opening structure. It'll have slightly different names, but the basic idea for a piece goes something like this. You start and you take the rug as the beginning point, and you take a section and there's no particular time associated with it. And during that section you lay out the contours and the way the scale is used, and you sort of give people an idea of what the sonic world of the piece is like. And then you introduce a time pulse to it, whatever, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3246.49" data-end_ts="3246.69" title="3246.49" id=c_"3246.49">__tah__</span> you're in. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="3248.31" data-end_ts="3248.53" title="3248.31" id=c_"3248.31">__the__</span>, that will develop in very different ways. But basically the idea is you sketch out the melodic raw material and then you bring the rhythm in, and then you elaborate on that, and then everybody gets to show off what they can do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b><laugh>. Right? That's, and then basically you re, you sort of like re you kind of like restate it again, and that's it. That's the whole thing. Okay. So technically speaking, you can sort of make sense of the piece by listening through it. Right. I suppose you could say that the Sonata form is superior, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Because it has the same stuff for some reason that it probably has something to do with my particular deficits. I never understood or heard sonatas or fugues for that matter, is that I thought they were impossibly cool, but they didn't tell me everything I needed to know about the piece while I listened to 'em. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Whereas I think Indonesian music for me totally did. And so when the time comes to think about structuring stuff, that's, that's what Indian music taught me. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> now mean obviously I've never really studied it, but, with a teacher, because of course in that tradition, your teacher really matters. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Right, right, right. Because there are things about the raaga that you won't get, you won't find out. And all you have to do to, to hear that is to listen to two different people, do the same raaga. You're really clear that something different is at work. And part of that difference at work has to do with virtuosity, but also who your teacher is. Sure. And some traditions there, there are things that only your teacher will tell you. So, one of the instruments in Chinese music I really like is called <span style="color:red" data-ts="3350.97" data-end_ts="3351.09" title="3350.97" id=c_"3350.97">__a__</span> kuchin. It's spelled G u q i N. It's a zither fretless zither, which is really quiet, played often as a solo instrument. And if you decide to study it as I decided I was going to do, it's really a good idea to find a teacher. And I thought, well, I can't find a teacher, so I'll just read a lot about it. So here's what I found out. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>The stuff is notated, it's notated out the kazoo. In fact, the, the notation tells you things about what your left and your right hand are supposed to be doing that are way more specified than anything that I know of in western music. Okay. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3390.14" data-end_ts="3390.36" title="3390.14" id=c_"3390.14">__So__</span>, so, you know, they're like n kinds of vibrato. And the notation tells you what vibrato you're supposed to use, or you're supposed to start with this vibrato and switch to the other one. And by the way, the two fingers of your right hand should be bent back. When you do this <laugh>, it's just like insanely specified. There's only one problem. There's no indication as to time, nothing. It's just notes. It's notes and what you do with your fingers. And if you're a western person, you think that's insane. What? Because if you have a really, if you have the, if you have a really old piece, good luck trying to figure out how it works. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="3429.42" data-end_ts="3429.62" title="3429.42" id=c_"3429.42">__Right__</span>? Right. There are gonna be some physical things about it that will say, I couldn't possibly do this very fast. So I guess it must have been slower. But the point is, it's your teacher who gives you that information. Interesting. So when you study, that's what you acquire. Oh, wow. So, yeah. And, and you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3445.8" data-end_ts="3446.02" title="3445.8" id=c_"3445.8">__pr__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3446.09" data-end_ts="3446.38" title="3446.09" id=c_"3446.09">__Nath__</span>, what you learn when you study with <span style="color:red" data-ts="3448.11" data-end_ts="3448.46" title="3448.11" id=c_"3448.11">__prath__</span> is not the way to play the piano. It what you learn is what <span style="color:red" data-ts="3453.84" data-end_ts="3454.06" title="3453.84" id=c_"3453.84">__PR__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3454.21" data-end_ts="3454.5" title="3454.21" id=c_"3454.21">__Nath__</span> plays. Right? Yep. So that's, to me, one of the other sort of interesting things. And for electronic music that becomes complicated because for so many of it's, it's an entirely, it's an entirely separate, undertaking. But actually those things have their roots in these, like social groups. Ghanaian drumming takes a whole bunch of people to do. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3475.72" data-end_ts="3475.94" title="3475.72" id=c_"3475.72">__And__</span>, you know, clapping music is like only two people doing what, Ghanaian drummers do or listen to, to people like big drum ensembles like Dooo and <span style="color:red" data-ts="3486.81" data-end_ts="3487.1" title="3486.81" id=c_"3486.81">__Gaia__</span> Rose, for example. You're, it's just difficult to sort of get that down to the idea of a phase pattern that was righteous genius. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3496.68" data-end_ts="3496.9" title="3496.68" id=c_"3496.68">__it__</span> could really do that. Right. Indian music, same thing. Lamont Young, the wel <span style="color:red" data-ts="3500.74" data-end_ts="3500.9" title="3500.74" id=c_"3500.74">__tune__</span> piano is an interesting case of, of like exploring a non-Western tuning thing that I can imagine. Terry Reilly's keyboard works. It's hard to imagine those things without knowing the Raga because it's really about what he does 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Without, without trying to, to like mock it, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Oh, no, not at all. In fact, my experience has been they really respect that tradition. Yeah. Yeah. They're simply not bound by it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Or maybe mock wasn't the right word. Maybe like, appropriate would be Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>They're <span style="color:red" data-ts="3529.1" data-end_ts="3529.14" title="3529.1" id=c_"3529.1">__not__</span> appropriate. Sounds a little, that sounds a little, it sounds evil. Imperialist <laugh>. But the idea, no, but the idea is like, what part of a thing? You know, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="3537.28" data-end_ts="3537.5" title="3537.28" id=c_"3537.28">__lo__</span> I love, I love Miles Davis, but I don't love everything Miles Davis does. I'm obviously not going to be like, those guys that recorded kind of blue note for note over again. I'm not gonna do that. So if I love Miles Davis, what part of, what part of him, of, of his work do I take into myself? Like what, what is it that I, that I borrow? John Cage? Same thing. When we think about, if we're willing to admit that we have foremothers and forefathers, then how do we, how do we talk about them? How do we respect them, and what do we try to communicate of our understanding of them to other people? Right. 'cause yeah. You know, the world's full of people who want disciples but no ancestors. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, I'm not really one of those. I'm not really one of those guys. And I think my twenties would've been a lot easier if I'd had a better sense of who my ancestors were, it would've saved me a lot of trouble. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I, so now, how, how do people honor history now? I mean, one of the things, and when we talked to, when I talked to Mike Matley a couple of, couple of weeks ago, he had, he <span style="color:red" data-ts="3612.91" data-end_ts="3613.19" title="3612.91" id=c_"3612.91">__kinda__</span> went off on, this idea of the internet isn't an unvarnished bo positive because there's no clear gatekeepers. It seems like what he, you know, one of the things he was talking about was the, the development of history and the development of the important people you need to be aware of in order to honor that history. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Well, one of the ways, one of the ways that I think you honor history, and I think you're actually doing it. I mean, I'm, I'm going to take a moment and say nice things about you. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3648.01" data-end_ts="3648.23" title="3648.01" id=c_"3648.01">__Oh__</span>, you're, one of the ways, one of the ways that you honor history is by the realization that history is not something that is made in the past. History is being made in the present moment. History is essentially the emergent, is the emergent dialogue that comes out of people who mark where they are in the present. So I think one of the great ways that we, that we honor the idea of history besides seeking to understand it, its people and its context and all that other stuff, which is hard work and takes time away from you sort of messing around with your analog rigs. So mm-hmm. <affirmative>, let's not get ourselves about that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>It is a choice. It is an investment of time, but one of the ways that I think we honor history is by seeing ourselves as a part of it. And that's one of the things that I think, I think you're giving in some respects, this weekly podcast is a snapshot of history. And I would also say it is not a history that is made by great men. It's a history that's made by people who are doing all kinds of stuff. And, one of the smart things that I think you've done, or one of the things I think is really interesting, and you, and I didn't do it here because this is our second chat, is this idea about people have to explain how they got where they got. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>You know what I mean? That's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, because I'm fascinated by it, because if not, for no other reason, for my own track to where I'm at is such a convoluted hellhole, it's impossible to have ever pre imagined that that was the route to take. Right. Right. And, what I'm finding is, you know, so for ages I thought, well, I had to take the hard road if I would've only followed the easy road that everyone else took. And in talking to people, I find out that nobody took an easy road because there was no such thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Yeah. Well, everybody, everybody thinks, yeah, everyone thinks that their suffering is particular <laugh> or, or there are, or there are things, there are things about the, there are things about, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3770.58" data-end_ts="3770.8" title="3770.58" id=c_"3770.58">__are__</span> forced to develop something in splendid isolation that actually may have turned out to be an advantage. Right. That might have actually been, those accidents may have been the things that make, that made us or make us, because again, I'm, I've spent a lot of time today talking about the past, but there are things that make us what we are. One of the things about Cases book that I think is great Uhhuh <affirmative>, is that it's basically about the social history of things. Right. Another fantastic book about that is George Lewis's history of the Associated for the Advancement of Creative Music, university of Chicago Press. The book is called A Power Stronger Than Itself. And it is essentially how the A A C M came to be. Right. And it's a great book because it's full of those ideas about, you know, history is made by people in their own present and here are their stories. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, great book. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, Gregory, I want to thank you for another fascinating chat. It was, hilarious. I learned an, an awful lot. I really appreciate it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>And, I just, I I just feel like I sounded like I was a billion years old. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I know, but you know, the flip side of it is, one of the things, and, and you and I sometimes, in our business life chat about how, we see an awful lot of academic movement occurring within a very specific line of ancestry, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Oh, yeah. True. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And, the, the problem with that is that it means that in other, that other narratives never get spoken aloud. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Yeah, that's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Very true. And, and so this is where it, there have to be people with both the experience, but also the willingness to talk about the experience. And that if anything, when we talk about outliers, I, I think that so, and, and non insiders in the music and, and electronic music fields, I think one of the problems is that especially people who have been in the system for a long time or have been outside the system for a long time, have gotten beaten up by it <laugh> beaten up to the point that they no longer feel free to talk about it. And so I think it's, I think it's great that you're willing to talk about it and to talk about these people and to bring to our attention, the, the necessity for them to be spoken of in the history of this work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Yeah. Well, that's, yeah, it's, and in fact, it makes the history, it makes the history more complex and it sprawls. But the net effect of it is, I hope, invites it sort of invites people. So instead of, you know, you can think of history as either like a photograph of the negotiations that ended the Vietnam War. It's a big round table and there's a whole bunch of old men sitting looking serious around the table. Or you can think of history as, a wedding reception for two really big, really large sprawling families, <laugh>, who have never really met each other before. And in one case, everyone is negotiating quietly over a limited number of things. And in the other case, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's a matter of person sitting 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>To your left is somebody you've never met. They've had too much to drink, and they're weeping quietly into their plate. <laugh>, the person to your right, is basically trying to corral their kids and throw <span style="color:red" data-ts="3980.32" data-end_ts="3980.44" title="3980.32" id=c_"3980.32">__an__</span> elbows back and forth. And, there's a couple sitting across the table you've never seen before who appear to be engaged in some kind of passionate embrace and, and you're just sitting at the table trying to make sense of it. Right. And your natural inclination is to think, yeah, what am I doing here? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and yeah, and, and asking what <span style="color:red" data-ts="4000.32" data-end_ts="4000.48" title="4000.32" id=c_"4000.32">__they're__</span> doing. The other assumption is that, is that everybody else here planned to do the thing they're doing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Exactly. And they didn't. They didn't. And the really good question about history is, is basically a really simple one, and that is like, what am I doing here? Right? Like, looking at where you are looking at, at, at who, who these two families are who catered the, who catered this thing. Like, like how come there's two kinds of ham? Right, right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Questions like that. What story does that tell Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Exactly. And then just saying like, well, what am I doing? What am I doing here? Or should I go over and ask, should I go over and ask that person to dance? Right. That's the other, that's what, that's what history is and that's why we love it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, thanks so much. I really appreciate it. It was fantastic. And 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Anytime, man. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>All right, man. Have a great day. Hey, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>And no promises about what to do next time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>No, not yet. <laugh> I'll, I'll, I'll squeeze them out of you eventually. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Okay, cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>All right, thanks, man. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So there you have <span style="color:red" data-ts="4069.64" data-end_ts="4069.8" title="4069.64" id=c_"4069.64">__it__</span>. Another great conversation with Gregory Taylor It's really interesting to learn more about Sonology, one of the most influential institutions that you may have never heard of. So, is really great to have Gregory share some of that. A couple of, news notes here. First of all, I really want to thank, Chris Larky and Amy Bible for their work, putting together the, the Denver synth Meet. It was yesterday. It was pretty amazing. Saw some amazing bargains get bought and sold there. I think it's one of those things where the first year is gonna leave an impression on people for, having seen some, <span style="color:red" data-ts="4113.96" data-end_ts="4114.08" title="4113.96" id=c_"4113.96">__a__</span> awesome things go down. And especially a chance, a great chance to talk to Jim <span style="color:red" data-ts="4119.87" data-end_ts="4120.16" title="4119.87" id=c_"4119.87">__Lone__</span>, who came out from Iowa to spend a little time at <span style="color:red" data-ts="4123.56" data-end_ts="4123.72" title="4123.56" id=c_"4123.56">__the__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="4123.75" data-end_ts="4124.04" title="4123.75" id=c_"4123.75">__Sent__</span> Meetup. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So that was really cool. Secondly, I want to thank all the listeners, for keeping the numbers up. It's really been fantastic to kind of watch things move forward. I am really pleased with that. And finally, I just want to ask you to help me out with one thing. There's a bit of a movement now a foot to actually get people to get onto iTunes and, give us some reviews and some ranking points, because apparently I'm missing out on fantastic opportunities to get more listeners by not having a highly rated podcast. So if you could just get on there and do that, that'd be great. Certainly Herman Pearl has been kind of banging on me about, getting a little more serious about my personal marketing. So there you go. I'm not much into it, but I'm, I'm just <span style="color:red" data-ts="4177.72" data-end_ts="4177.96" title="4177.72" id=c_"4177.72">__gonna__</span> try and do it for him. Right. Well, in any case, I want to thank you very much for listening, and I'll talk to you next week. Bye.
