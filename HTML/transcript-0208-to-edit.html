</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today, I have the great pleasure of speaking to someone whose reputation has been around me for a long time. I've never actually talked to him before, and so I'm looking for this, looking forward to this opportunity. His name's Peter Grenada. He has got a quite a history, in our, in our neck of the woods. He's, he was involved in an awful lot of electronic music at its inception. He's been involved with a lot of amazing mu music makers, but unfortunately, he, is mostly known for having been the person behind Plan B. That is, was a company that cratered relatively spectacularly at one point. I think that there, there might be a lot of, concerns about him, but I'll tell you, a couple of weeks ago, I, spoke to Jill Frazier. You all would've heard that interview by now. She spoke so highly of him, and I was like, I have to talk to him in order to get my own, make my own opinion. And so that's what you're gonna get to hear. So with that, I'm gonna welcome Peter to the podcast. Hey Peter. How are you doing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter Grenader: </b>I'm doing great. I don't know what I should say after that, that introduction, but let's go <laugh>. Alright, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Let's go. So, just to get, just to clear the air, and I'll tell you something. I was involved in modulars forever, but I was never involved in, or I was a real late, joiner into both the eurorack world and the muff wiggler world. So all of the stuff that happened happened before I even gave a shit. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b>Right? Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But when I came into the community, all of a sudden I saw all of these fireworks going off and I didn't know even what was going on didn't seem like something I should care that much about. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b>Here. Here's the deal. Let's take the premise of the classic haunt movie. Ghost is a ghost because he has to, or she has to fix something they screwed up. And when they do, they go wherever they go. I, that may happen to me <laugh>, but it will not <span style="color:red" data-ts="157.325" data-end_ts="157.525" title="157.325" id=c_"157.325">__ha__</span> it might will not happen over this issue. I will tell you, I have settled this issue. Yeah. I screwed up in a public relations way. I took care of, there's no one that's been unpaid. There's no one that hasn't been apologized to. But most important, Darwin, I learned to gain, have respect for the mistake I made and the effect I had on people. And that is very key. Okay. Because then I'm empathetic. I'm not defensive. Okay? It's all settled. There's a few people that are going to hate me forever. And I will tell you, without going into detail, there are issues with me, with muffler that go well beyond anything I've done. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b>Right. Okay. There's political things in play that are stupid and silly, and I couldn't tell you what they are. 'cause I've been banned for life. Okay. <laugh>. I see. So tell me <span style="color:red" data-ts="203.835" data-end_ts="204.125" title="203.835" id=c_"203.835">__what__</span>, you know, text me if they say something good about me, <laugh>. But, and that's the thing I, I've, look, I, I paid the price for my heirs and I did make mistakes. It wasn't as bad as it got blown up to be. I mean, <span style="color:red" data-ts="217.475" data-end_ts="217.765" title="217.475" id=c_"217.475">__they__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="217.765" data-end_ts="217.925" title="217.765" id=c_"217.765">__they__</span>, everyone circled wagons. I was accused of being a cocaine addict, a meth addict. I was accused of watching tranny videos at work. You know, it got stupid. And, but it is what it is, you know? But it's over. And I think I didn't release any products until it was taken care of, and I wouldn't have released a product they take care of. And the product did very well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b>It actually sold more outside of the oscillator. That's Model 15, which is, I'll never have another one like that. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, it sold like right up there. The, it was exactly what I thought. And I was very careful. You know, I am a good barometer and I, I've learned to take my ego out of evaluation of how do people feel about me. And I just read it and it's like, okay, now's time. And it's okay. I mean, I'm personally over it and I've moved on. The people that I unfortunately involved in it have moved on 'cause they've been taken care of. And I'm sure there's gonna be people that don't like me. I, but, you know, there's nothing I can do about that der when it happened. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's a good point. And you know, I, I have to admit, I am not, I'm not without my sins, and I'm sure I, I left plenty of people in the side of the road that heat my guts. And I know that there are plenty of people whose guts I hate. So I think maybe that's just what happens when you're around for a while too. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b>Yeah. Now, the one problem I <span style="color:red" data-ts="297.185" data-end_ts="297.305" title="297.185" id=c_"297.185">__ha__</span> the one problem I have with Darwin is that when it does come up, it's always weaponized. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="302.185" data-end_ts="302.305" title="302.185" id=c_"302.185">__then__</span>, but I'm gonna have to live with that and I'm good for it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, what's interesting is it seems like too, you kind of got caught in a bad place because you, you were villainized by an internet community that just realized it had some muscles. Right? Right. And so maybe that was the real misfortune for you is that, is that all of a sudden you were the first person that got to feel the strength of the, of this adolescent community. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b>It's, it's immature for me to say. There's other people that did worse things than I did. But there are other people that did things that never took care of 'em. Just screw it. They went awol. And I wouldn't have that. Matter of fact, you know, life was really bad for me and I deserved it. Okay. I mean, I lived outta my car with my dog for three months. I sublet my apartment. I used to wait around my dad, wait for him to go to work, and I'd sneak into his house with a soldering iron and build a Model 10 and go over to my worldwide disturb. At the time was big city music, just so I could have <span style="color:red" data-ts="364.165" data-end_ts="364.325" title="364.165" id=c_"364.165">__di__</span> money for dinner. Okay. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So I paid those dues. I deserved it. Okay. I'm not pulling out the violin, but when I got the gig with Kevin Key in 2011, I think it was, Kevin came over to my house. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b>He had a module that needed to be calibrated and he brought up the idea of licensing two of my products. And we did it. And the first payment before I got a penny was $6,000 to LB first payment. I paid other people, well, I could, through the most unfortunate means possible. I got the means to take care of everyone when my father passed away. And honestly, this, if you can call everyone that got paid at that time, the money came from the Grenada Family Trust. The estate attorney paid everyone before I got a dime. And that's the way I wanted it. So I feel I'm karma free on it. I understand that. You know, we all know that we cannot influence people's opinions and I have to live with that. And I'm fine with that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Well, you know what, I appreciate you being willing to talk about it and, and sort of clear the air. 'cause now we can talk about other stuff. Yeah. <laugh>. So, but before we totally put the Plan B thing away, I do wanna ask a couple of questions about it, because again Sure. I came along kind of after that. I remember looking back <span style="color:red" data-ts="440.925" data-end_ts="441.125" title="440.925" id=c_"440.925">__in__</span> it and being like, oh my God, how did, how did someone produce all this stuff? And then also when I <span style="color:red" data-ts="450.165" data-end_ts="450.405" title="450.165" id=c_"450.165">__talked__</span> to friends of mine that had been doing it for a while, I've been doing the Euro systems for a while. So often they would point at either the Model 15 or the Model 12 and thirteens as being the best of class, the things that they turn you musically all the time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b>Thank you. You know, I'm very proud of the 12 because that was my concoction Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I got, what's his name's book? The, filter cookbook, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>John Lancaster 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b>Lancaster's book. Yeah. I said, okay, I get it. I get it <laugh>, I get it. And I said, let me make a, state variable filter. And I said, Fs would be perfect for this. And I swear to God, Darwin it. It didn't work at first. I made a couple of mistakes, Uhhuh, but then when the sound came out, I was like, holy God, I did it <laugh>. Because look, I, <span style="color:red" data-ts="500.305" data-end_ts="500.525" title="500.305" id=c_"500.305">__the__</span>, I could put the number of days I've had in a formal electronics education on the head of a pen. None. Okay. When I, we left Cat <span style="color:red" data-ts="510.565" data-end_ts="510.845" title="510.565" id=c_"510.565">__Arts__</span> and we had these huge bookla two hundreds, and suddenly we're like, what are we gonna do? Make music with rubber bands? I got a job at Serge's Place, just soldering Uhhuh. And my dad, bless his heart, was like, you know, I know you're gonna be the next era in Copeland, but right now, you know, the color code, get out of the goddamn house, get a job. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b><laugh>. Okay. And I went into electronics for like 12 years. And that's what gave me the, how would I say it? Guilty knowledge of how to do it. And for me, design is just taking a patch and it's one step down. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you need a random voltage generator. What do you need? You need a voltage controllable clock. You need a a noise source. You need a sample and hold, blah, blah, blah, blah. So it's patching one step down. But the, yeah, the model 12, I'm very pleased <span style="color:red" data-ts="553.545" data-end_ts="553.765" title="553.545" id=c_"553.545">__of__</span>. And I'm coming out with a dual, there's one delay now. 'cause the switch that I had speced disappeared. Mm-Hmm. <span style="color:red" data-ts="560.565" data-end_ts="560.605" title="560.565" id=c_"560.565">__<affirmative>__</span>. And I have to pec another part, but it's got an incredibly good low end and it's dual. And before the model 12 never went into full resonance. I didn't let it, 'cause it sounded like a kazoo and, but I fixed it, so it will oscillate now. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Nice. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b>But Darwin, I do it as a hobby now. Oh yeah. You know, before, honestly, prior to up to 2008, I was after World Domination. I wanted my goal, and we did make it, is to have an all plan B system. And we did produce 'em, we made about six of them. And that's not including the nine <span style="color:red" data-ts="594.645" data-end_ts="594.805" title="594.645" id=c_"594.645">__Inch__</span> Nails things and all that stuff. This is production stuff. Right. And I got there, of course, I dropped all the plates once I got up there. But that happened, but I didn't make it. Now I could care less. <span style="color:red" data-ts="605.025" data-end_ts="605.245" title="605.025" id=c_"605.025">__And__</span> I think more than anything else, that's just being practical because when you have 400,000 competitors, no one's gonna do that. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, it is, it is quite a different landscape, that's for sure. And I was gonna ask, you know, now, instead of having 50 modules, you've got a couple, and I was wondering how the business model for you <span style="color:red" data-ts="625.985" data-end_ts="626.205" title="625.985" id=c_"625.985">__had__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="626.205" data-end_ts="626.405" title="626.205" id=c_"626.205">__changed__</span>. And for you, what you're saying is that basically it's changed, you know, in that you're not going, you're not worrying about global domination anymore. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b>That's it. And it's, I have six modules ready to go right now. I mean, bill of materials Ready, Uhhuh, <affirmative>, three of them I've already given to my sub assembler. They all I have to do is say, go and they go the old modules, there's a problem. I lost all the files. I had my laptop stolen outta my car that had all the printed circuit board files for the through hole modules. So in order to do it, I have to redesigned face place. I mean, printed circuit boards, wait, I might do it someday, but I'm in no hurry. And I just want, I don't know about you if you've made drastic life changes as far as your directions, but in order to do that, to deal with that stress, I've always told myself, Peter, you can always go back to what it was before. Go in this new direction. If you don't like it, go back. Right. And always allow yourself to revisit it later. And that's how I got back into music. And that's how I'll get back into this. But right now, if it feels good, I'll do it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So let's talk about your history a little bit, because Okay. There's, there's some amazing history in your life. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b>I got you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Came <span style="color:red" data-ts="698.925" data-end_ts="699.125" title="698.925" id=c_"698.925">__outta__</span> this the amazing <span style="color:red" data-ts="700.445" data-end_ts="700.565" title="700.445" id=c_"700.445">__K__</span> Arts world, which Yeah, back in the day was, I mean, they were hatching the, the amazing composers of the future <span style="color:red" data-ts="709.265" data-end_ts="709.485" title="709.265" id=c_"709.265">__out__</span> of that place. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b>It's funny 'cause at the day, at the time, Darwin, we were nothing. <span style="color:red" data-ts="714.435" data-end_ts="714.725" title="714.435" id=c_"714.435">__Yeah__</span>. Columbia, Princeton and Albany and the University of, of Illinois, <span style="color:red" data-ts="721.065" data-end_ts="721.285" title="721.065" id=c_"721.065">__ano__</span> Yeah. That's it. They were getting all and Austin, they were getting all the national attention. We and Mills College. We were like, yeah, more, whatever, you know? And, and, but now <laugh>, that's become a legend. And I all, I gotta say I was extraordinarily lucky to be in the right place in the right time. Jill as well. Gary Chang as well. Mm-Hmm. <span style="color:red" data-ts="743.325" data-end_ts="743.365" title="743.325" id=c_"743.325">__<affirmative>__</span>. And we were the first generation of students, you know, when with Mort. And, and the greatest thing about Cal Arts was Mort. All the things he did wrong about designing that program. For one, I'm a composition student and they didn't give us orchestration. Mm-Hmm. That's, that's crazy. Okay. Yeah. Look, his first year, he didn't even get chairs. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b>He wanted everyone on the floor. I wasn't there <laugh>. Okay. But something he did very Right. He had a budget amount of money for X amount of professors. And he, he nev intentionally didn't hire one of them. Instead he would use that budget allocation to bring in visiting composers. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, let me just give you port list. Aaron Copeland of Vladimir Chesky, Milton Babbitt, prill, smiley, these are people that came to your classes. I got stoned with Phil Glass. Oh, geez. <laugh> Okay. Lamont Young, I can't remember one that was very significant for me. Oh, Jacob Druckman taught me how to write music in one week. John Cage, I was there the moment <span style="color:red" data-ts="813.955" data-end_ts="814.245" title="813.955" id=c_"813.955">__Jill__</span> and Le <span style="color:red" data-ts="814.485" data-end_ts="814.645" title="814.485" id=c_"814.485">__Barber__</span> first laid eyes on Mort. He, she came out with John Cage, but she didn't go back with him. She stayed, I mean, it was love at first sight. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b>I was standing there, I was like, oh my God, look at that. And they've been, you know, very happily married for a thousand years now. Yeah, indeed. So that was, I was very fortunate. Okay. And that music did become, I'm putting this in silent quotes, historic. Right. And I was, I was able to benefit for that. And, you know, I tripped back into modulars or electronic music to begin with. I don't wanna go into that story, but I worked at a speaker company and two guys worked at Moog. And we started talking and boom, suddenly I was hooked again. And I wrote a piece of music. And I, because I had been a graphic designer for 12 years before that, I was so used to people hating what I did or loving it. I wasn't <span style="color:red" data-ts="866.085" data-end_ts="866.245" title="866.085" id=c_"866.085">__as__</span> bashful to mail things out. And I just mailed this piece out there about 14 music festivals, and I frigging <span style="color:red" data-ts="873.025" data-end_ts="873.245" title="873.025" id=c_"873.025">__won__</span> one of them in Barcelona. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b>I was like, what? And that opened a lot of doors. And then, you know, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="879.945" data-end_ts="880.365" title="879.945" id=c_"879.945">__Millen__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="880.605" data-end_ts="880.765" title="880.605" id=c_"880.605">__Chrysler__</span> basically went out <span style="color:red" data-ts="881.685" data-end_ts="881.765" title="881.685" id=c_"881.685">__of__</span> business. I was, I was like, what in the hell am I gonna do? And I just said, okay, let me try sense. But what I did is I, I enveloped myself in the world of music again. And I was very lucky. Can I tell you a great story? Sure. I was on the phone once with this guy, a high school friend who, he's the guy that said, you gotta check out this class. We had a teacher that had a VCs three, you gotta check this class out in high school. And I didn't in high school. And he was the best music theory teacher I ever had, including Cal Arts. Okay. Anyway, so it opened a lot of doors. So I just happened to be on the phone with him. And I, I got a click on my phone and I said, Mario, hold on. It was Don Ula. And I said, Don, can I call you back? And I came back the phone and he, I, he chuckled. I said, yeah, that was <span style="color:red" data-ts="928.245" data-end_ts="928.365" title="928.245" id=c_"928.245">__down__</span> bugle. I told him, I call him back three minutes later, Darwin strike me dead. If I'm lying another click. It was Bob Mogue <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh man. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="936.065" data-end_ts="936.285" title="936.065" id=c_"936.065">__Oh__</span> God. And I said, okay, Mario, this one, I gotta take this one. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b><laugh>. And it's just been like that, you know, I've become friends with Wendy Carls, I tripped into it. I actually, I kind of manipulated that to happen. But I did it very passively and much to her enjoyment we're, we're still good friends. I mean, an ex-girlfriend and I had been to her studio. She did a private recital for us in 2009 in her studio. That's is a life pinch me moment. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>No, no kidding. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b>Yeah. You know. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Do you feel like a lot of this happened because it was a small community and people were looking to make connections and friendships 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b>Or, I don't know. 'cause I entered back into it through academia. <span style="color:red" data-ts="978.145" data-end_ts="978.365" title="978.145" id=c_"978.145">__Oh__</span>, okay.

And I got back into it only because I went to a nam show in 2001. And that was when you were Dieter and, and Analog Systems was there. And I looked at their stuff and I said to myself, oh shit. Moog won the war. Yeah. You know, it was kind of the Moog anthology. Right, right. And I was working on music and I was tweaking booklets and surges, and it was not gonna happen for me. I couldn't do it. So I start designing stuff on my own. And then one of these days I said, you know, screw it. Let's test the water again and let me see if anyone will buy this stuff. And, and that's how that started. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b>And I am very proud of that though. I get no credit for it. And maybe that's not important. I have to take my ego out of it. But all this talk about east and West Coast, this was Gary Chang and I talking about it in blogs. Okay. Mm-Hmm.

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's interesting you mentioned, Nile Steiner because you have kind of a long history of, of working with and around him. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b>Yeah. And he's one of the most generally wonderful men I've ever met in my life. Oh God. He's just like, you know, those pictures of Jesus with the lambs and the kids all circled at his feet.

</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Didn't have to explain it to him. Right. No, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b>No. And he's a pleasure to work for. And I'll tell you one thing that broke my heart one day. We were, we worked on that circuit for a long time. And he said to me, Peter, I just wanna tell you something. For 12 years since I retired, I've just been screwing around on my bench, making oscillators how to neon lights. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1104.065" data-end_ts="1104.285" title="1104.065" id=c_"1104.065">__And__</span> now I feel like I'm working again.

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Job. He's thinking, you right, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b>Yeah, I know. And, and he's just such a lovely man. And you know, he, when he collapsed, he went in the studio <span style="color:red" data-ts="1119.365" data-end_ts="1119.565" title="1119.365" id=c_"1119.365">__and__</span> his work, you know who got him into it?

He was basically in the wrecking crew for 17 years. Yeah. Okay. He, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that sound was all over everything, you know, like Yeah. From the, that middle disco period on that was such an iconic sound coming out of LA 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b>Yeah. And if you listen to Apocalypse Now, you're like, shit. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. There he is. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b>Yeah. Yeah. So, and he's just a great guy. We might do another module together. That's cool. We really, we really enjoyed working with one another. That's nice. You know, and we split it right down the middle. And I was, I, I couldn't have been more, more pleased. And that circuit that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1170.385" data-end_ts="1170.605" title="1170.385" id=c_"1170.385">__he__</span>, his core, that new filter has never been released. It sounds similar, but it does a lot more. But I can completely ripped the crap out of it. And we added things and he was so open to it. Oh, that's cool. It was, it was never possession. And, and who in the hell are you? And you know, that kind of thing. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I'm the great wazoo. Why are you talking to me in that way? Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, let's, let's talk a little bit about your, your design chops. 'cause you said that you've got no formal training, but you did spend a lot of time with, with soldering iron in under your fingers. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What was the process that you went through to learn, learn synth design? I mean, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1207.825" data-end_ts="1208.045" title="1207.825" id=c_"1207.825">__You__</span> talk about, well, about 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Let's sort like this patch patch level down. Where did you learn to learn those level down pieces? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b>Well, let's, take it one step down. How did I learn electronics? I lied <laugh> and I got it. I swear to God, I got a job as an engineering tech for a company. And the guy clocked me in a microsecond and he basically said, you don't know what the hell you're doing, do you? And I said, no, should I quit? And he goes, no, I'll just teach you. It's, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1233.265" data-end_ts="1233.685" title="1233.265" id=c_"1233.265">__prefer__</span> it's easier. And that's how I got my basic chops. Unreal. Okay. As far as modules, I learned how to analyze schematics. So the Model 15, let's start there. The Milton Sequencer kit preceded it. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Okay. And I just wanted voltage control of direction. Right. That's a stage assignment. And that's why I did that. And there's a very easy way of doing that. Doing, using a CMOs digital part. I'm not gonna go into it, but it has a bus address input that you can convert from a analog voltage in about two seconds. Oh, okay. Don <span style="color:red" data-ts="1267.885" data-end_ts="1268.085" title="1267.885" id=c_"1267.885">__Bule__</span>, remember the famous legend of his kits in the nineties? You remember this? Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The garage thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b><laugh>. Yeah. You, you might get a schematic. Probably won't <laugh>. You get a face plate and a, and a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1279.885" data-end_ts="1280.045" title="1279.885" id=c_"1279.885">__pure__</span> circuit <span style="color:red" data-ts="1280.245" data-end_ts="1280.445" title="1280.245" id=c_"1280.245">__board__</span> has no silk screen graphics on it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Everyone I knew that had some of 'em, they were sort of like on little picture things on their, nobody ever made a damn circuit out of 'em. They just like, it was like having a baseball card signed by <span style="color:red" data-ts="1294.125" data-end_ts="1294.365" title="1294.125" id=c_"1294.125">__them__</span>. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b>You know, well there's a guy in Kentucky, I think he is Guido. He goes, but Joe, something goes by Guido. He contacted me 'cause he had a 2 58 kit. Uhhuh didn't know what to do with it. Uhhuh. I said, I'll build it. I low bid him the other person that was going for it. 'cause I wanted to get, I wanted to hear those. 'cause even Mort agrees with me that the 2 58 was the best VCO that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1315.805" data-end_ts="1315.965" title="1315.805" id=c_"1315.805">__book__</span> ever made. Yeah. And I did it and I looked at the circuit and I said, well, you know, one his core, that that triangle core is not his circuit. The science shaper is not his circuit. These are old Navy circuits. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Okay. And I said, well, this is a shitty way of doing the comparator for the reset. This is a shitty way of doing the conversion to square waves, A shitty way of making a saw tooth. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b>And I redesigned it using ICS and not transistors. And that's the model 15. And I added some things, but not much. Right. So that's the model 15. And the way, the reason it sounds unique is I introduced the A CFM into another part of the circuit. It's not where people usually put it. And I have a triangle core, which has less harmonic content. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Now think about this. Darwin, if you have a core, if the heartbeat of your synth has, I mean if your oscillator has less harmonics, you're gonna get a cleaner FM sound. Right. 'cause you're not dealing with the partials and that early level. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The mess Yeah. The mess that that turns into. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b>Yeah. So that's how I did it. And then it's deduction and it's breaking things down to functional blocks. Okay. And you'll find that you use the same functional blocks for different modules. 'cause it's the same function. It's just you're patching it differently. It's like a pre-PA synth. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But it's a module. You know, it's, it all matters where you put the output jacks. Right. What makes it a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1398.285" data-end_ts="1398.445" title="1398.285" id=c_"1398.285">__symptom__</span> or a module. Right. And that's, that's kind of how I did it. And oddly enough, I worked my ass off. I got what we got 24 modules done by oh eight and I only had two major Oh shit. That shouldn't have been like that in, out in the fields. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1412.065" data-end_ts="1412.285" title="1412.065" id=c_"1412.065">__Wow__</span>. You know, I made a mistake on <span style="color:red" data-ts="1413.845" data-end_ts="1414.005" title="1413.845" id=c_"1413.845">__the__</span> model 10. I forgot to put a current limit resistor on a dial that would blow if you did something wrong. And there was one other item. We fixed both of them. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well that's cool. Now, one of the things that you were kind of known for, and I think you kind of still are, is using, trolls. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And was that just from the influence of looking at <span style="color:red" data-ts="1435.005" data-end_ts="1435.205" title="1435.005" id=c_"1435.005">__ULA__</span> circuitry? Or, or did you just find them to be particularly musical? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b>Well, two reasons. One <span style="color:red" data-ts="1442.435" data-end_ts="1442.725" title="1442.435" id=c_"1442.435">__book__</span> the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1443.245" data-end_ts="1443.365" title="1443.245" id=c_"1443.245">__ULA__</span> influence, they sound amazingly brassy for filters. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Okay. So I say, okay, there's a winner. And then for other things, it's really frigging simple. Okay. If you want a cross feeder, just use a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1455.245" data-end_ts="1455.445" title="1455.245" id=c_"1455.245">__factor__</span>. Or you can use 17 other <span style="color:red" data-ts="1457.685" data-end_ts="1457.805" title="1457.685" id=c_"1457.685">__I__</span> components and two op ramps. Right. You know? Right. <laugh> the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1462.725" data-end_ts="1462.885" title="1462.725" id=c_"1462.725">__pro__</span> the problem. And that's exactly the way Don thinks. Uhhuh <affirmative>. And it as severely brilliant as he is. And I spent a week with him in Berkeley. I was the first guy to demoed the two, the 200 E namm Uhhuh <affirmative>, amazingly brilliant intelligence that we can't even pretend to understand some of his design stuff. He didn't know what he was doing either. He's got parallel resistors when you don't need <span style="color:red" data-ts="1484.685" data-end_ts="1484.845" title="1484.685" id=c_"1484.685">__them__</span>. You know, he's got screwy values. He can tell he's chasing a problem instead of understanding. Bob Mogue would not have done that. Right. Bob Mogue did not hate <span style="color:red" data-ts="1493.445" data-end_ts="1493.605" title="1493.445" id=c_"1493.445">__to__</span> have the creativity that Don did, but he sure had the engineering chops that Don didn't. Okay. And the, the VLS came out of that. Mostly. I use 'em in filters, but I also use a VL in my random because it, it is frigging easy right now. Now it's a problem. 'cause they're what, $15 East? They used to be like three. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, and they're gonna be getting increasingly hard to come by. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b>Yeah. They got CAD minimum that's lead, you know, and they had a wa what they used to tell me is they had a waiver and the waiver ran out for Rojas. Oh, interesting. And I can't complain about that. I don't like the idea of lead and stuff. So I, I get it. You know? Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So you actually, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1534.425" data-end_ts="1534.645" title="1534.425" id=c_"1534.425">__you__</span>, I was gonna ask you about this just in terms of your design work. Yeah. Because you kind of implied it in other things. This idea of instead of engineering your way to a solution, sort of like, you know, feeling your way to a solution. You kind of mentioned that in the way Don works, but it seems like some of your stuff has that too. I mean, if for <span style="color:red" data-ts="1555.045" data-end_ts="1555.165" title="1555.045" id=c_"1555.045">__no__</span> reason in some of your new, your current module line, it's got some pretty wacky name stuff. And so when there's, when something gets a wacky name, I generally assume it means it didn't already have a name <laugh>, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b>Well, you know, you're funny about that. 'cause I really hate people that name knobs like, you know, blah blah blue or Yeah. Right. Crunchy. It's just like, dude, in 15 years when someone buys this and eBay after this whole fad is over, they're not gonna know what the hell this thing does. Right. Okay. So that's my feeling. But what I did do Darwin is look at a rubber band and say, how can I make that a better rubber band? It's something that people overlook, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1592.845" data-end_ts="1593.005" title="1592.845" id=c_"1592.845">__with__</span> someone that nailed it more than anyone. Two hp, those guys nailed it. That idea was under everyone's nose for 20 years. No one thought of it. Right. And they did it. But I did the same thing with the multiple. I needed a multiple in order to have a system. And I said, well, shit, how do you make a multiple better? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b>I made it a buffered mold. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. I was the first one to do that. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Okay. And it's is simple, but it, it was different. And I did the same thing with my Heisenberg and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1620.065" data-end_ts="1620.285" title="1620.065" id=c_"1620.065">__the__</span> tap generator. I couldn't have done it without Phil Gallo, but the tap clock was just a paradigm shift. No one had ever upscaled nobody. Not in modules. You know, instead of you have a clock divider, which divides down easiest thing in the world. But how about pressing in a hold notes and, and calculating the correct value for eighth? No triplets, not so easy. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b>You know, or actually determining the pace based on two depressions of a button <span style="color:red" data-ts="1648.945" data-end_ts="1649.165" title="1648.945" id=c_"1648.945">__and__</span>, and doing it linearly and metrically. I mean, that was a, that was a real accomplishment. I couldn't have done it without Phil filled it all the coding. I did the electronics. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So that's the answer to your question. I said, you know, I I'm not gonna do electrode node circuits, I refuse. Right. And I'm gonna make things that are a little bit more interesting. I'm gonna think about things now. I had the benefit of being a composer. Okay. And saying, what do I want to do? Matter of fact, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1674.985" data-end_ts="1675.405" title="1674.985" id=c_"1674.985">__during__</span> a lot of my modules, it came into existence based on one piece of music, the secret life of, of semiconductors. And I would design modules because I needed them for that piece. Uhhuh <affirmative>. So that's what I did do that. I think others didn't wayman. He, he was, he's not a musician. Right. You know, so he was have a VC input that turned off the knob when the VC was in there. I was like, no, don't do that. Dude. <laugh>, you know, Bob Mogue was kind of a musician, but not really. Right. So I would think of things differently like that. I'm not saying I'm bright, I just, I will say that I took a second to catch my breath and think about it before I put my name on it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I think, I think one of the things that comes across with your designs from whether you go back to the, the Morton or the Plan B stuff, or you look at the current stuff, you have opinionated designs, you know? Yes, I do. And, and I think that there's something valuable about that because if nothing else, it allows, it allows potential customers to take a look and say, well, does that match what my needs are or doesn't it? Yeah. Yeah. Instead of being so, you know, one of the things that really gets tiresome is when any instrument is designed in a way to be in a way that's so generic, nobody can say something bad about it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b>Right. <laugh>. Yeah. Yeah. Because yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>There's a lot of bad things to say about a trombone, but if what you need is a trombone, what the hell are you gonna do? Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b>Yeah. And the funny thing is that the guy, what is his name? Bernie something. The Electro <span style="color:red" data-ts="1768.195" data-end_ts="1768.485" title="1768.195" id=c_"1768.195">__Oaks__</span> guy. Yeah. Bernie. If one these, if his estate said, guess what, you gotta pay us a license. Now half the modules in the Eurorack world would disappear. Okay. And there's nothing wrong with that. I mean, look, who told me this the other day was brilliant. Grant Richter on the phone. He said, yeah, every kid with a college loan is doing a module and we can't blame 'em, can we? And I said, no, we can't. You know, so they're in the dorm room at night, they do a module. Some of these guys are really, really stepping out on a diving board like Grant did. Like I did. We quit our jobs. We really committed. And some of 'em are like one-offs, you know? And that's fine. That's fine. I'm just glad people have choices. Right. Okay. I'm not the digital analog guy. I love digital instruments. I think a digital delay will kill an analog delay anytime of the day. I'm just, before we didn't have choices. You had a Steiner Parker system, you were stuck with it. So thank God we have choices now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now let's talk a little bit about your work, both as a composer and a performer. 'cause again, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1828.685" data-end_ts="1828.805" title="1828.685" id=c_"1828.685">__a__</span> a big part of you and my conversation right now came up because in talking with Jill, yeah. I was looking at, at the work that she was doing with the Zizi Society Yeah. And who's one of the players of the Zizi Society, but Peter Grenada, <laugh> and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1845.965" data-end_ts="1846.045" title="1845.965" id=c_"1845.965">__I__</span>, and I'm like, is that the same Peter Grenada? I know. And she was like, probably <laugh>. How long have you been performing with that group and how long have you been, how long has it been since you kind of got back into performing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b>Okay. One, let me just say for the record, I know she's listening. It's been an absolute pleasure working with Jill. She has ultimate confidence in my musical and compositional chops as I do in hers. So I can say, like, for instance, we tracked Danny Carey. I pulled in a friendship favor for this record. And she, I said, you want to come? She goes, I trust you. You can do it. And I'm the same way with her. It's really common when you have a garage band playing <span style="color:red" data-ts="1886.215" data-end_ts="1886.565" title="1886.215" id=c_"1886.215">__smoke__</span> in the water. It ain't so common when you're doing stock <span style="color:red" data-ts="1889.765" data-end_ts="1889.965" title="1889.765" id=c_"1889.765">__housing__</span>, music. Okay. You know what I mean? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So I'm very fortunate in that I love performing. It all started in 2007. I was very fortunate to ask to do a, a live analog ensemble at Redcat Roy, at the Disney <span style="color:red" data-ts="1904.605" data-end_ts="1904.885" title="1904.605" id=c_"1904.605">__Ellos__</span> Theater downtown la. And I, I asked Ty Paul Sand, he drove, he flew in from Wales. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b>I couldn't believe it. I asked Richard Dev Divine, he came from New Orleans. Okay. I got Alessandro involved. Gary Chang Cha Smith, and this fantastic visual artist. If you've ever been to Los Angeles, Darwin, you have, you know, the columns at LAX. Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1926.065" data-end_ts="1926.285" title="1926.065" id=c_"1926.065">__The__</span>, he did those. He's a, he's a public assemblage artist. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> brilliant. And we loved it. So, but it was a lot of work. We only did one show. So we were talking for a long time about doing it again about four years ago. We were talking to, Richard Lahar. It was gonna be Richard and Jill and I, Gary Chang and Steve Roche. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1946.825" data-end_ts="1947.045" title="1946.825" id=c_"1946.825">__Oh__</span>. And, and Richard died right in the middle of it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That broke my heart when that happened, man. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b>Oh God. Was he a he was brilliant and a nice man, but he was a brilliant composer. Yeah. He really got it. And yeah, that was heartbreaking. So it kind of died out. I went to go see Mort at Red <span style="color:red" data-ts="1965.985" data-end_ts="1966.205" title="1965.985" id=c_"1965.985">__Cat__</span> Live. Guess who sat next to me, Jill. And that's when it really started. But it took us a year to get to it. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And she sent out an invitation letter to, you know, she put it together, for Chaz and I, Chaz Smiths. But Chaz has moved up to, grass Valley now, so it's not really feasible. So she and I, and we've done four or five shows, they've been great. Some of them <span style="color:red" data-ts="1989.795" data-end_ts="1990.085" title="1989.795" id=c_"1989.795">__have__</span>, we've worked our way through disasters, performance disasters, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1993.885" data-end_ts="1994.085" title="1993.885" id=c_"1993.885">__then__</span> we're tracking a record. It's gonna be probably mastered within two weeks. Oh, great. Look, we're adults. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b>We have busy lives. <laugh>, we have other things in our life. Jill's involved with a lot of things She can't, her and my performance schedules sometimes don't mesh. I'm gonna be doing three shows in the, over the winter with Shero. I don't know how to pronounce this last name. It's Japanese and Douglin up in the Bay Area. And it's a completely different type of music than CEC Society. It's more, it's more San Francisco based. It's more Terry Riley. It's more immediately accessible to the audience. And, and it's, it's almost all analog. So I'm excited about that and I love it. Dude, I don't know if you've seen the big picture of my ARC system. I haven't turned it on since I moved four years ago. Everything's my performance system. And I I if you, if I could gig every other day, I'd be happy as a lark. I absolutely love it. It's fun. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What kind of system do you, what's kind of system do you have now that you <span style="color:red" data-ts="2049.105" data-end_ts="2049.325" title="2049.105" id=c_"2049.105">__get__</span> out when you gig? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b>I have eight rows. Slightly wider than 84 hp. A lot of it's course Plan B, but I'm not, I'm not a narcissist. <laugh>. I am, but not that bad. Okay. I mean, we're all narcissists, aren't we? But yes, I'm not that bad. I mean, I've got two cubit Nebula. I have one mutable instruments module. I have a tip top one. I have a live loop reflex. I just got the moto <span style="color:red" data-ts="2078.485" data-end_ts="2078.685" title="2078.485" id=c_"2078.485">__miles__</span>, format filter. I've got a lot of other people's stuff. I've got a shitload of two hp. 'cause I think those are, they're brilliant. Yeah, indeed. Okay. And what I've done, it's kind of cool. Now, Darwin, I we're doing the mastering to this record. There's one piece that's based entirely on a single sample of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2098.115" data-end_ts="2098.405" title="2098.115" id=c_"2098.115">__Glen__</span> Beck rambling off about Benghazi. Just that real nutty shit. Right, right. I needed the second part of this to be tonal, more tonal and the moto mouth. I said, Jesus Christ. I mean, before I put my fingers on it, I knew what I was gonna do with it. And I got it last week. And boom, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2115.445" data-end_ts="2115.565" title="2115.445" id=c_"2115.445">__I__</span> laid it in there. And that's kind of how I approached this. You know, when we were doing Benghazi Live, I realized I needed two nebulize. One wasn't enough. I bought another one. And it's just, so, it's a conglomerate and it's designed for live, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But when you're doing live, you're not doing sort of like the traditional modular twiddly thing though. You, I mean, I've seen some videos of some of your live work. You have, you have composed works that you're doing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b>Yeah. No, no. That's cics very much so. And a lot of the sounds I've sampled that I've done in the modular, because not so I can play polyphony, because I don't wanna read <span style="color:red" data-ts="2150.525" data-end_ts="2150.725" title="2150.525" id=c_"2150.525">__patch__</span> like a madman. Oh, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2151.765" data-end_ts="2151.885" title="2151.765" id=c_"2151.765">__no__</span>. Or I, I've used the whole system on another patch. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Now the stuff I'm gonna be doing for, with Doug and Cyro is all tweaking. Okay. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2161.325" data-end_ts="2161.445" title="2161.325" id=c_"2161.325">__I__</span> wait a minute. Tweaking of knobs.

</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b><laugh>. I mean, I am intentionally not bringing the Rollie or the computer. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> on those gigs, I will be using an iPad, but just as a mini mini sequencer. Interesting. And as a touch plate pads, you know, that fire, other analog events. That's it. So yeah. It's very composed as these <span style="color:red" data-ts="2184.125" data-end_ts="2184.285" title="2184.125" id=c_"2184.125">__<inaudible>__</span> stuff, but that's fine. I have Jill Frazier. She's brilliant. Why else wouldn't you do it? Right. Right, right. I mean, Jill can look, our first rehearsal, we worked on the Benghazi piece first. The first day was kind of piddling around. She said, come back tomorrow. I couldn't believe what she got done that night. Exactly what I had my mind on. And I didn't have to tell her. Do you ever listen to Sha Botanics Touch? Yes. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2208.625" data-end_ts="2208.845" title="2208.625" id=c_"2208.625">__It__</span> opens up with the sound of the voice. That's actually what <span style="color:red" data-ts="2211.925" data-end_ts="2212.085" title="2211.925" id=c_"2211.925">__his__</span>, his secretary saying the word touch, and he razor blade the shit out of it. And she did it. She did it. And I didn't have to tell her to do that. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2220.265" data-end_ts="2220.485" title="2220.265" id=c_"2220.265">__Is__</span> she got it. Yeah. You know, so yeah. We're, that music is much more composed. We have a piece in this new show, I'm actually calling it the, you sound old enough to understand what this means. The Ballad of Commander Coating <span style="color:red" data-ts="2233.655" data-end_ts="2233.815" title="2233.655" id=c_"2233.655">__is__</span> Lost Planetary Airmen. Do you remember that band? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yes, I do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b>Commander. Yeah. And it's, it's sort of a homage to, Ray Manic meets Terry Riley meets, Steve Wright meets Rainbow and Curved Air. And it's gonna be long. It's a completely different vibe, but it's all in the moment live, you know, so it's a whole different vibe as what I do with Jill. Sure. But she, look, she knows I'm doing it. I'm not, she's completely fine with it. She is a, she's a extremely accomplished archer. Okay. She's a national champion in her class of archery. She's got things to do. Yes. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thater. She didn't say a word of that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b>Yeah. Don't piss her off, dude. Go right between the eyes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Okay. I'm keep my distance. And apparently it's a lot <span style="color:red" data-ts="2282.015" data-end_ts="2282.215" title="2282.015" id=c_"2282.015">__larger__</span>, longer of a distance than I thought it needed to be. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b>Yeah. And don't wander in her backyard when you drop over. Okay. You might get more than you asked for 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. So besides the performance, then, what else, what else have you got on your plate for the, for the near future? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b>Well, we have the cex album coming out. Wait till you see the cover. Your head will explode. We asked Simon Paul to do it. He was the guy that does a lot of the illustration for downloading Skinny Puppy and subconscious. Then these three performances with those, with Cyro and Doug, I'm looking forward to, I'm sure Jill and I will perform again. The Model 12 dual is coming out, and then maybe someone will invite me for Thanksgiving. Other than that, I got nothing to do. <laugh> <laugh>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2326.975" data-end_ts="2327.325" title="2326.975" id=c_"2326.975">__Right__</span>. Well, there's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2328.065" data-end_ts="2328.285" title="2328.065" id=c_"2328.065">__the__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2328.285" data-end_ts="2328.445" title="2328.285" id=c_"2328.285">__plan__</span>. <laugh>. Hey, I really enjoyed this Darwin before. Sorry to interrupt. Thank you so much. It's, it's humbling to me that someone thinks about me. It really is. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, with that, I'm going to let you go have the rest of your evening. Thank you so much for your time. I appreciate it, man. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Peter: </b>Thank you. Thank you. Peace. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What an amazing set of stories. I think it was really great to get a chance to hear Peter's story from Peter and, to also kind of hear how all this stuff came together for him, where his head's at, and also where he is planning on going with some of his music work. Really interesting stuff. I wanna thank you the listeners, again, first of all for supporting me through the Kickstarter. You could probably hear some less than ideal microing going on in this episode. I'm really looking forward to the updated mic and preamp setup that you guys have helped me get. But with that, I am going to let you go for the week. We'll catch you next time around. Thanks. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2390.805" data-end_ts="2390.925" title="2390.805" id=c_"2390.805">__A__</span>.
