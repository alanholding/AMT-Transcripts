<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, today I have the great pleasure of getting a chance to talk to Mike Honick. Mike works under the artist's name <span style="color:red" data-ts="22.695" data-end_ts="23.045" title="22.695" id=c_"22.695">__Kindo__</span>, or it might be spelled kind om, OHM, if you are so, interested. Mike assures me that he'll accept either pronunciation, <laugh>. But with that, this is our first time talking, even though I'm about to go see him at a little workshop. But, let's get to know him a little bit together. Hey, Mike. How's it going? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike Hodnick (Kindohm): </b>Very good. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thank you so much for taking the time out to have a chat. I really appreciate it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>Yep, no problem. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Why don't we start off by having you talk a little bit about, about your kind artwork and how you produce that kind of stuff? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>It's kind of a, a broad moniker I use for all of the electronic production. I do. I'm typically drawn to kind of almost club bass music type sounds, but I'm not really interested in straight ahead techno music or, I like kind of bringing more of a, kind of a twisted approach to those sounds. And my method of production is, is also a little unconventional using programming and live coding techniques and programming languages to sequence sounds and also do a little bit of the sound design as well. So that's <laugh>. That's, that's what I like to do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. When you talk about using programming languages, what are the languages that you're using? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>The, the one that I use most often is Haskell, and I use this library called Title Cycles. Title as in T-I-D-A-L, title Cycles. That's the main library within Haskell that I use. I'm not really a Haskell programmer. If you ask me to write a Haskell <laugh> a Haskell program, I could not really do it for you. But this title Cycles library does make sense to me. And I can write Haskell code that kind of fits within the rules of, of title cycles. I also, use JavaScript, which is more of a, a web programming language, which relates more of what I do for my day job. But, there are some audio capabilities as well within web browsers. And, I've done a little bit of that as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. It, when you said Haskell, my, teeth almost fell out because <laugh> for me, all of the people that I've ever seen who talk about Haskell, you know, were definitely sort of like overloaded with the pocket protector action. Sure. You know, it's like super nerdy, ultra CSS academic kind of a language. And that's something you think of as really a creative tool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>Yeah, that's a a really good point. I think there's kind of a, a renaissance of those styles of languages. So when I say styles, I mean a functional language. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, functional programming being a, a very specific thing. Functional programming as opposed to object-oriented programming or as opposed to procedural programming. So, Haskell, along with other functional languages, JavaScript has some functional capabilities as well. Elm Ang, I'm not a functional programmer, so I'm gonna struggle to <laugh> mention many more, but, it, but I think it's also a style of programming that kind of lends itself to what Title Cycles does with, with music and patterning a way of kind of chaining functions together to create an output. So I think it kind of lends itself to, to what I do or to what Title Cycles wants to accomplish. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So, for people who aren't familiar with functional programming, my sort of like, bigger than a breast bread box explanation is that it really is, instead of building an object that has a ton of functionality, what you kind of do is you build a bunch of utility functions and you pump the data through it, and you build up complexity by chaining together groups of functions. Right. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>I think that's a, yeah, that's a a one way or a good way to explain it. Yeah. Rather than objects that have a lot of state Right. Properties or you have functions that just process data. You have inputs and outputs. So in a functional program, you're continuously the program's continuously sending inputs into functions that are composed in such a way to give you a result. And Right. You can even put functions into functions and have a, a very, complex chain of stuff, but yeah, that's, that's the idea. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. Sounds like fractal programming in some horrific way. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>Yeah. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So what is it about title cycles that speaks to you from <span style="color:red" data-ts="314.005" data-end_ts="314.125" title="314.005" id=c_"314.005">__a__</span> artistic standpoint? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>Yeah. So when I first saw it, I immediately thought it would be really fun. I just recognized it as something that would resonate with me with what I wanted to do with composition or electronic music composition. I had done some <span style="color:red" data-ts="332.705" data-end_ts="332.925" title="332.705" id=c_"332.705">__DA__</span> based composition before that, which I always thought was challenging and, and kind of a square peg, round hole situation for me. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But when I, you know, me being a programmer for my day job, when I saw title cycles and I saw a video demonstration of it, I thought, okay, I, I know I can make this work because of my technical background, but I also saw, like, immediately this great deep rich path kind of laid out in front of me. Like, okay, I can take a lot of the sounds samples techniques that I've acquired through my d based, experience and then apply it to title cycles. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>And, but I think what I was most interested in was kind of rhythmic density and complexity. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, more conditional rules of, of when and how a pattern like a musical pattern should be, should behave. For example, kind of using more traditional musical terms, like measures or beats if, you know, every three measures, shift time in this direction by one quarter of a beat. Every five measures, raise everything up by this pitch and have kind of this, this logic <span style="color:red" data-ts="407.775" data-end_ts="408.125" title="407.775" id=c_"407.775">__based__</span> approach or conditional based approach to when things should happen. And you have this kind of a resulting tree of musical patterns that could take a very long time to repeat. Right. You know, instead of laying out 100 measures in a DI could just express the same thing in a few lines of code. Sure. So that, that was really the attraction there. And 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's the kind of structures that Title Cycles provides. It's like, every, every this often do this kind of thing, but it speaks in musical terms. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>I think at its core, title cycles is really just a patterning language and a musical output is kind of, it's it's default result or it's default behavior. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you, you can use title cycles to produce an image or to send out, data on a network in some pattern. It just so happens that it, it couples itself with a, <span style="color:red" data-ts="465.945" data-end_ts="466.065" title="465.945" id=c_"465.945">__a__</span> sample synthesizer that runs in Super Collider that, that receives OSC messages. So really all title cycles is doing, is sending out OSC messages. Okay. So, but to kind of get back at what you're asking, there's a way that you write patterns in title cycles, just using kind of some string text you put inside of double quotes, what you want your pattern to sound like, starting with the names of sounds or samples, you know, bass drum, snare, drum base note, whatever you wanna name your samples. And then kind of to the left or on top of that pattern string, you can start defining these conditional functions. So I wouldn't say the conditional functions are, you know, required or, or a necessary part. The core of title is really that, that string pattern that you're typing, how you wanna arrange your sounds in, in a certain pattern. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. You kind of answered the next question I had, which was, how do you take these patterns and turn them into sound? And so you say it really is just piping OSC data over to Super Collider sample playback device. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>Yeah. That's kind of the default mode of title cycles. Okay. Is to be a musical language that well <laugh> results in music, I shouldn't say it's a musical language. Right. It's a pattern patterning language that will send these messages over a network. OSC messages to the Super Collider synth. The, the name of this synth is called Super Dirt, but that's a, that's a different discussion. So, yeah. It, it can really do anything. It can just work with data locally on a, on your own computer, or it can send, you know, these messages across the network. It can also work with midi. There's a, a MIDI plugin available for title cycles to write the same types of patterns and conditional logic with, you know, an analog synthesizer or a, a eurorack modular synth. It doesn't send out cv, but through midi you can convert that to cv. Right, right. CV signals. So yeah, it's, it primarily works over a network with, with OSC kind of in, in its main mode of operation. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Now, one of the things that I'll say, so I, I went over to your <span style="color:red" data-ts="597.085" data-end_ts="597.325" title="597.085" id=c_"597.085">__cloud__</span> SoundCloud site, and I'll make sure that that's listed in the, in the show notes for people to check out. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I went over there and I was listening to a bunch of it, and it's really compelling music. It's really, there's a lot of density, but there's also like, it's like coupled with clarity. It's, it's almost like you talk about these overlaying structures. It's almost like you can hear them kind of developing. Right. Okay. Sure. But it's, it's unlike what I'm used to hearing when I hear particularly people that are doing live coding. I, I, there's one similarity between like, live coding people and looper people, which is that the, the arc of a performance always tends to sort of sound like, okay, I'm gonna make one sound now I'm gonna add a second. Now I'm gonna add a third. Now I'm gonna add a fourth. Now I'm gonna take away that third one. Now I'm gonna take away the fourth one, and I'll add back in the third one. You know, it's sort of like this build up and then tear down kind of thing. Right? Yep. And that kind of arc is almost, indicative of that kind of mechanism being done. Your stuff didn't sound like that. Is that just because of how you edited it, or is it just how you tend to operate the system? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>It's more of a conscious decision for, to operate, to operate it like that now. Okay. When I first started using title cycles and really discovering the practice of live coding, I, I did more of what you are describing, where I would start from scratch and build up, some basic sounds from nothing. Start, you know, starting with <span style="color:red" data-ts="697.125" data-end_ts="697.245" title="697.125" id=c_"697.125">__a__</span>, a bass drum or what whatever I felt was interesting, some textural sound or, or whatever, add things in. Let that, that whole thing evolve over the course of 20, 30, 60 minutes, whatever that might be, continuously change that, that composition as it goes, and really just improvise. And I performed live like that a few times, and it was at the same, it was super exhilarating and at the same time extremely stressful <laugh>. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>And it wasn't that I was displeased with the result, but I think that what I, I was searching for a different mode of production or performance. So at one, one performance, I, I did, I decided I would kind of half prepare like these skeletons of a song or a composition ahead of time and kind of work with them. So instead of going completely from scratch, kind of build these lightweight skeletons of a, of a track or, or a, or a song, and then kind of transition between them. So still leaving a lot of room for improvisation, but not necessarily starting from scratch. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and, and still having a framework to work from. So that the first time I did that, it, it worked for me. It's not necessarily gonna work for everybody else, but I, I enjoy preparing that and I enjoy performing like that. And so I think, so what you're hearing on my SoundCloud page is more of those prepared types of pieces where yes, this is a kind of a, a small composition, and on SoundCloud I will just kind of record a segment of that. Right. I, I tend to not really throw out completed tracks on SoundCloud anymore, but yeah. I will, kind of record a snippet of that skeleton in a certain state, and then that, that's what you're hearing on SoundCloud. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Got it. So one of the things that I like doing, in my podcast, and I'm gonna ask you to play along with me on this one, is to learn a little bit about the background of the people that I talk to. And I'm curious about where you're coming from, because you actually seem equally comfortable talking either about the musicality or about the technicality, right? <span style="color:red" data-ts="839.555" data-end_ts="839.845" title="839.555" id=c_"839.555">__Yeah__</span>. You seem to have a, have fluid facility on both sides. And I'm always curious about where people like this come from, because it's not a natural state of affairs. I don't think. I, I oftentimes find either people that are very technical and have trouble have, have trouble making, you know, being able to discuss the musical side of what they do. Or conversely, people are very comfortable with the music and are tend to be stymied by the technology. Sure. And I'm, I'm curious, what's your background and how did you get to be so comfortable with both sides of that track? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>I'll, I'll answer that as best I can. <laugh>. Okay. When I was, growing up, I played piano and also, grew up as a, a kind of a classically trained percussionist as well as drum set. <span style="color:red" data-ts="892.185" data-end_ts="892.405" title="892.185" id=c_"892.185">__So__</span> I, I grew up playing in school bands, high school, junior high wind ensembles, orchestras, youth orchestras. Then in college, went down more of a industrial engineering path academically, but, still played in, the university, wind ensembles, jazz groups, percussion, ensembles. So I, I definitely had a musical side of me at least, kind of as a performer in a group setting or an ensemble setting. As I carried out my engineering studies and, all of my <laugh>, all my friends called me a music major wannabe. 'cause that's where I spent all my time <laugh>. I didn't really spend time in the, the engineering commons. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>I was always in the, the humanities area up at the University of Minnesota Duluth, where I was going to school, in the practice rooms, hanging out with the, the music majors. So, but I, I knew as a career path, I definitely had this, this engineering hat that I wanted to wear. So I always imagined that music would be a part of me and what I wanted to do for in my life, but, not necessarily as a, as a career. So I really kind of took a break from a lot of musical performance after college, maybe five year, five years later, really got into home recording and, and kind of guitar and drums and vocal production. Just, just 'cause I was interested in a lot of the nuts and bolts of the technical aspect of that. You know, how do you record, you know, do a multi-track recording, how do you mix stuff? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>How do you produce stuff? How do you get something to sound good? This was before I even got into electronic production. In the meantime, during all this had really gotten into programming and, and web development and kind of on the job side had really <span style="color:red" data-ts="999.545" data-end_ts="999.965" title="999.545" id=c_"999.545">__gotten__</span> more of the, the programming path. But in my spare time was really obsessed with just music production and, and mixing and, and those sorts of things. So I got into the electronic <span style="color:red" data-ts="1012.825" data-end_ts="1013.045" title="1012.825" id=c_"1012.825">__DA__</span> based production eventually, and a lot of those same kind of technical music production concepts carried over. And in a way I've even felt they were easier with electronics because I didn't have to be concerned about microphones or the room I was in for sound quality anymore. But, I, I think music to me has always been kind of a balance of a technical challenge as well as, you know, a compositional challenge as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>From an early age, you know, albums would turn me on or turn me off based on the production quality. I would really be interested in, well, why do I like this sound of this album? Why do I dislike that one? And, and try and understand what I liked about the arrangements or the sounds and into the, a lot of the, artists I was interested in. I, I found that I was really interested in the production and the producer more than maybe the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1066.445" data-end_ts="1066.605" title="1066.445" id=c_"1066.445">__artists__</span> themselves. So I guess I just hadn't always had an ear for kind of that, that critical ear of understanding how a track or an album was produced, and it was, this became almost a game or a, or just this research project of how, how did that producer do that? And so I, I think those are maybe some, some components of the answer of Sure. What, what led me kind of down the, the technical path of why the technical aspects of music, intrigued me as, as well as, maybe with my performance background, why, why I kind of have that more creative side as well, that that's also comfortable. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So sometimes finding out what a producer or an engineer or a technically savvy artist has done to produce their sound is obscured either because they never mention it or they go out of their way to obscure the way that they did the work. How, how were you able to gain information about that? What did you do to find out more and where did that eventually lead you? I mean, who were some of your artists and what did that lead to? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>Oh, sure. Well, kind of going back to thinking back to when I was doing kinda multi-track recording, recording my drum set, recording a guitar on an amplifier, recording my voice and being completely unsatisfied, wondering how the heck do I make this actually sound good? This was back before social media and before a lot of information sharing. So it was a lot of trying to read up in books, or, like the tape op magazine. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. I had a subscription to that just trying to read, about what producers were doing. I also had a few friends that I could lean on too. There was a, a friend of mine up in Duluth, and I would email him every so often and he'd have some suggestions about how to improve the clarity of a snare drum or things like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>So it was a lot of trial and error and, very frustrating at times, <laugh>. And then I think over time, with the emergence of modern digital audio workstations, like, whether it's Ableton or, or FL Studio or Pro Tools, I think a lot more of these secrets started to come out a little bit because the tools themselves kind of presented more feedback or data about what you were doing anyway. You were asking about artists, I'm trying to think of spec some specific examples. I, I listened to a lot of, as far as rock bands go, I, I loved bands like Helmet and three 11 on the, the jazz side of things. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1231.345" data-end_ts="1231.465" title="1231.345" id=c_"1231.345">__I__</span> listened to a lot of, miles Davis, Clifford Brown, a lot of Chick choa, and returned to Forever. And even those were, even though those were older recordings, they sounded good. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>So I wasn't necessarily looking for, you know, modern production sounds or techniques, but, you know, using old vintage equipment, how did people get things to sound so clearly on the electronic side? I was really into a lot more like break core and drum and bass jungle types of influences, which is probably explains where some of my interest in, in rhythmic density might come from. But layering of multiple drum parts, together with a melody component and a bass component, and how do you get those things to, to sound clear and a mix together. Right. Because the first time I tried it, it would just sound like a, a muddled mess, <laugh>. And that's when you start to learn, okay, you can create some frequency space for these things and Right. EQ treatment. And, and those things started to make sense through, through learning and some modern tools and trial and error. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The other thing is though, you know, growing up doing percussion drums and percussion and stuff, I mean, that also gave you sort of some early experience. So even if you're doing the most basic percussion in a school band kind of environment or something like that, you end up running into different kinds of rhythms and different rhythmic figures that aren't necessarily the things that just come rolling out of a drum machine, if that's how you learn. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>Yeah. You're, you're exactly right. The, the phrasing is different. You're, you're fitting in a part with a greater picture, a bigger picture. Right, right. Rather than just thinking in terms of 16 steps or Yeah. Another limitation like that. Yeah. Which to maybe kind of bridge a little bit with title cycles. Title cycles really has no, it does not have a 16 step limit or a 64 step limit, for example, you can have any amount of subdivisions you like within a, a, the concept of a title cycle or measure, which, kind of getting at what you were saying with, you know, playing percussion in a, in a wind ensemble Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you have a larger picture, you're fitting in. You don't have to conform to 16 steps. So yeah, maybe there is something to there why, title, another reason why title cycles is, was appealing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So what is it that drew you into, I mean, is it just the kind of engineering mentality that drew you into <span style="color:red" data-ts="1386.445" data-end_ts="1386.845" title="1386.445" id=c_"1386.445">__compute__</span> computers? Or did computers draw you into engineering thought <laugh>? I mean, did you, which, which came first? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>I think engineering first. And it's kind of funny, I knew that I wanted to go to college and I thought, you know, I think an engineering career would make sense for me. I, I was good at math and the sciences and, I, I knew engineering would be a good fit for me, but kind of through process of elimination, I, I chose industrial engineering, which in retrospect, I, I would never choose now, <laugh>. But it, it's more about, you know, manufacturing processes, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Process, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>Yeah. Yeah. Rather than chemical engineering or computer engineering would've been a great fit. But, at, so there, there's maybe a great, you know, support of the answer. I actually chose industrial engineering over computer engineering or, or soft, computer science. So the programming aspect came after that, that, that engineering choice. This was back in the, the late nineties with the emergence of the worldwide web and, and HTML programming and h the HTTP protocol to nerd out on a musical podcast <laugh>. So with, I thought the worldwide web was so cool when, and I thought, Hey, as a student at college, I can have my own directory with my own webpages. I wanna do that. That sounds fun. I could put whatever information I wanted on it and style it however I wanted, and, and I was hooked. And that was kind of my programming bug after I, started the, you know, my studies on, in the, on the engineering side. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So now talking about, the choices you're, you've made for your current artistry, I'm curious why title cycles and not one of the more established textual languages. I mean, super Collider is the obvious choice, but, you know, going all the way back to like C Sound, there's the web audio stuff, JavaScript, there's a lot of different options for doing sound and sequencing in a textual language. Why title cycles? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>I guess I, I recognize title cycles as a very, a way to very, very quickly express sequences in a, in a very small amount of code. And it's also a very live environment, meaning that you can type something and immediately have it change, as opposed to having to recompile your program Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> to then change the sound output. So, so Title Cycles was built from the start with this idea of a very concise way of putting a pattern in a, in a small amount of text, and then evaluating it in an editor, and then immediately having the sound output change. Now, I, I don't have experience with C Sound, so I can't speak to that. Thinking of some of the other things you mentioned, now Super Collider does have that liveness component. It, it also has that ability to where you can evaluate it and then have the sound change immediately. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>I guess I had never, I learned about title cycles before I learned about Super Collider, and I learned about Super Collider shortly after, I guess by my own laziness, I <laugh> I just recognized title cycles as a very immediate way to start composing and creating the patterns. I was kind of interested in the things I was hearing in my head. I knew I could do it with title quickly. Sure. With, with Super Collider, it looked more of like a, a synthesis environment. Yeah. I, I didn't didn't hear as much of the complex sequencing going on that, that I was really interested in. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's, that's a really great point. And in fact, it's kind of funny because you, you actually sounded a little apologetic about being quote lazy, but, you know, that would be like saying, you know, somebody who picks up and loves the guitar saying, well, you know, you can play more notes on a piano, so why didn't you choose <span style="color:red" data-ts="1622.665" data-end_ts="1622.885" title="1622.665" id=c_"1622.665">__Be__</span> <laugh>? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>Sure, sure. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's, that's not, that's not necessarily a sensical statement, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>Yeah. So, I mean, there, there are, super Collider users who do similar things to, to what I do, you know, a little bit of composition, a little bit of improv, a fair amount of sequencing, and they do some amazing stuff. I think it's just kind of recognizing the language and its capabilities is something that resonates with you. Just, just like choosing guitar over piano. It's, it's an instrument that you set your hands on it and poof, you know, it, it clicks. That's, that's the best way I can explain Title I. I've tried other things like Sonic <span style="color:red" data-ts="1664.785" data-end_ts="1665.005" title="1664.785" id=c_"1664.785">__Pie__</span>. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. There's also a few other, there's a live coding. I've tried Chuck, I've tried another environment called Jer, which is a web browser based live coding tool. Really, every, every single one of those is extremely powerful. And the users who, who use those things and do it well, I mean, they're phenomenal artists who pull off great things. But, you know, when I've tried to give them a shot, they, they don't resonate with me and title cycles doesn't resonate with them. And that's, that's just, that's the beauty of it. <laugh> so gross. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So, I'm curious, when you talk about sort of building up skeletons for performance works mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, what does that look like? Does that look like a library of sub routines? Does that look like a shell of a program? Does it look like a bunch of codes in a code, in a buffer that you copy and paste? What, what does that kind of setup look like? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>So, kind of thinking of it from a, maybe a live performance standpoint, what I will do is I will kind of arrange the individual file. So I'll, I'll have files saved with code that's ready to go. And the code might be a two line thing, or it might be 20 lines depending on what it is. And I will have five to 10 files ready to go. And yeah, they are really just kind of partial snippets of things, or they may have more complete ideas that are muted or commented out Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> that I will then enable or edit Oh, okay. When it's ready to go. Sure. But yeah, I will either flip through these files in order, or, or sometimes I'll even just before the performance, kind of put 'em all into one big file in, in, in order and, and, kind of go top to bottom and, and just stream through one file, move on, move from one idea to the next. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, do you have, does everything done at the keyboard or do you have like an external controller that you use in in conjunction? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>For the most part, it's 100% on the keyboard. If, if I get into a tight spot, I might use my track pad if I need to <laugh> uhhuh mouse around a little bit. But for the most part, I am 100% on the keyboard and I'm actually typing. And it's just small edits of removing and adding things as I go. Sometimes some larger edits. There have been times where I have incorporated a MIDI controller to add a little bit of effect for things like a filter sweep or something like that for more continuous effect, you know, to make sounds come in and out. So I, when, when I'm running title cycles, the sound is getting pumped through my <span style="color:red" data-ts="1827.945" data-end_ts="1828.165" title="1827.945" id=c_"1827.945">__do__</span> through a master channel, and then I may have a MIDI controller just control a higher or low pass filter on that master, something simple like that. Sure. I have also used some analog synthesizers live using the, the MIDI library with title cycles, and I will do some manual tweaking on those just 'cause it's fun. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Do you prefer that or is it like a, again, a different instrument almost. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>I, I typically don't perform with keyboard synthesizer, so I'm mainly just kind of tweaking knobs. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and mainly kind of using it to affect the tonal quality of something that's already playing. Got it. And yeah, I do enjoy it because it's just, it's a totally different experience. Right. It, it is kind of a, it's a big context change. So I'm going from code editing to now looking at a, a layout of knobs and, and switches on a, a synth. I mean, it's not like it's a difficult con context change, I guess. But I may try and fade in apart using a filter or, a gain knob or change what, the depth of an envelope, you know, as something is playing and, and try to juggle code and, and those tweaks. Sure. And at the same time, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now I'll, I'll say this, there, there is kind of a big movement away from using like laptops in live performance with the sole exception that it's acceptable to be using one if you're doing live coating. So it seems like live coating is like the holdout for, you know, allowing a laptop on stage. Otherwise people are really moving towards, you know, whether it's electron boxes or MPCs or whatever. It's sort of like their control mechanism. But one of the things I've noticed is that live coders one of sort of like a, again, another commonality in live coding is that often the visuals that accompany the live coder are a screenshot of them live coding. Meaning that their visuals of their gig is literally the, the text editor showing <span style="color:red" data-ts="1952.765" data-end_ts="1952.925" title="1952.765" id=c_"1952.765">__them__</span> editing. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>Oh, right. Yeah. I think that's kind of in the spirit of, of what a, a lot of of live coding artists like to do. Right? They like to project their screens as they perform. Right. In fact, I think there's a, a good healthy debate amongst live coders if, if you should or shouldn't do that. To me it's personal choice if you want to. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I, I like to do it because I guess to me, coming from a traditional musical background, you know, playing, playing percussion, playing piano, that, that feeling of liveness and, and you know, my hands are actually making a change in the sound. That's, I guess that's part of my, my DNA, like, I, I want, I want <span style="color:red" data-ts="1994.205" data-end_ts="1994.285" title="1994.205" id=c_"1994.205">__to__</span> have a physical impact on the changes to a sound. And I guess having the audience be able to see or detect that, it just feels good, feels comfortable to me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>I have pro performed without a projector without projecting my screen before, and that's fine too. 'cause I guess at the end of the day, the most important thing is the musical output. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But, but yeah, I guess there is something in me that, that wants to convey, Hey, this, this is live and this is what I'm doing. I don't necessarily want to show menus and, and, you know, my da stuff, I'm, I'm gonna try and just focus on that text editor and hopefully nothing goes wrong where I have to switch from that and just kind of, you know, it's kind of a, it's a kind of a cool aesthetic where you've got, you know, a text on <span style="color:red" data-ts="2039.205" data-end_ts="2039.285" title="2039.205" id=c_"2039.205">__a__</span> wall or whatever. Yeah. So, yeah, I guess I, I like to do it. It, I think it's cool to do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I think that it's kind of interesting too because, well, first of all, it's unlike other stuff because you'd never really wanna watch a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2052.545" data-end_ts="2052.765" title="2052.545" id=c_"2052.545">__da__</span> user like work on a piano roll. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Nor would you especially wanna see somebody like scratching in, you know, semiquavers on a finale screen, right? Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But, the flip side of it is, you know, again, another thing I notice is that it sort of opens the doors for like a real nerdy kind of humor too. I've noticed that coders, a lot of times live coders will a lot of times build in like either puns into, you know, in, into things or when things are, when they're doing re re repetition or copies or whatever, they'll in some way highlight things. So it's sort of like, if you're savvy and if you're paying attention or if you really know that environment, you actually can kind of get an, get an inside joke that just really isn't available in kind of any other means. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>Yeah. You're exactly right. It could be through just code comments. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you can even have a conversation with the audience too. It, it can get downright silly at times, <laugh>. Right. But yeah, there are some of those inside jokes too. So in my code, when I want to mute a part, I could use a, a more conventional way of doing it where I, I literally tell something to mute or to stop, which there's a, there's more than one way to do that. I, I could, I guess the way you would do that normally in title cycles is you would set the gain of a part equal to zero, and I would type gain quote zero quote, to set the gain of a pattern to zero mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So I created an alias for that, which is GTFO, which an internet slang means something specific. Right. So I type GTFO and that stops the part from playing. There was a, a gig I played last October, and it was actually the, live coding conference in Hamilton, Ontario. And I had that come up where I typed GTFO and yeah. The first row of people right by me just started cracking up <laugh> because they, they thought that was pretty funny. Yeah. There's, there's, there's definitely an opportunity for some inside jokes and, and kind of that, that type of conversation with the audience at that level. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's pretty funny. Well, and, and conversely, there is something for this kind of challenging music where it does tend to be sort of like an insider's game anyway. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>Sure. Yep, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yep. And you know, as genres have become, you know, mini genres which have caved off nano genres, you know, it seems like the people that come to our gigs are people who have some very specific knowledge. They either, like in my case, I noticed for a while people who were like intrigued with a certain kinda module I used in my modular rig would come check it out because they wanted to hear somebody use that live. Right. Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2222.165" data-end_ts="2222.325" title="2222.165" id=c_"2222.165">__And__</span> I was like, okay, well that is in a way kind of an inside, maybe not an inside joke, but inside knowledge that is kind of unique to that particular super sub <span style="color:red" data-ts="2233.205" data-end_ts="2233.525" title="2233.205" id=c_"2233.205">__genre__</span>. Right, right. And so it's kind of interesting to think of live coating as having those kind of, those kind of things going on as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>Yeah. There, there is a bit of that I think, in a way when you, you can pick out the live coders in the room because they are first and foremost the people who are pretty much just standing and staring at what you're ty typing almost more than just listening or moving to the music. Right, right. And, and we all do it. I'm, I'm guilty of that as well, so, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So the one thing I'm curious about though is, and this is something I'll have to say I've never seen, is how do, is it possible, and if so, how would live coders ever work in an ensemble environment? How would you ever collaborate with someone else? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>Oh, that's a great question. So I guess there's two main approaches to that. It may be a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2284.485" data-end_ts="2284.765" title="2284.485" id=c_"2284.485">__tech__</span> technological limitation or not, but you can either share the same clock or not. That's, that's the issue. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you can either try to sync up if you're doing some something rhythmic by, by ear or by nudging time in your environment, or, or you can literally just try and go, go free and, and not sync up. So certain environments, tidal cycles being one can share a clock between multiple machines, I guess, and not, it's not necessarily easy to do. Yet in, in the title cycles community, we are trying to develop a means of synchronization using the Ableton Link protocol. We've created it, it does work on Linux and Mac Os, but we're struggling to get it to work on windows, windows being forever the, the troublesome the trouble child in the open source community problem child. I mean, anyway, you can sync up that way in Super Collider. There are some libraries that folks have developed to synchronize multiple machines together. But once you solve that problem, then it's kind of the, I I would suggest that it's, it's just like improvising with, with any other instrument that at that point you are now thinking of the space you're occupying when you're playing with somebody else, or how you're, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And the space you're leaving open for others. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>Yeah, exactly. Exactly. You can also improvise, of course with other, you know, non-computer instruments as well, which is maybe, maybe getting a little bit ahead of your question. But, you know, there's, I I, I recently did an improv with piano and electric bass, which was fun. But anyway, in kind of the live coding context, if you can solve that, that clock and synchronization problem, it, it eases some of the, the challenges a bit. Yeah. It's, it can be pretty fun. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>It, it can also be disastrous, you know, if that, that synchronization source kind of crashes or you have problems. And, and then that, that happened, we, we tried doing a synchronized improv at a show in, in Hopkins, Minnesota here, last year, and the network failed. And it took us a while to recognize that every change we were making was not going through, and it was just this endless loop of the same sound over and over, and literally had to pull the plug to stop it. Oh, wow. It's kind, but hey, that was, that was a thing, and that 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Happened. That 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>Was <span style="color:red" data-ts="2433.325" data-end_ts="2433.405" title="2433.325" id=c_"2433.325">__a__</span> thing. Right. That was fun 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Very interesting. So our time is just about up, I can't believe it, but I, I do want ask you about one other thing. You mentioned that your SoundCloud site tends to be snippets of things where you turn on the recorder and you play something. Right. And then you also have a band camp site where you have like eight releases out. Yeah. For you, what is the difference between performing and recording? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>Okay, let's see. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>How do I answer that? It's a curiosity for me. Yeah. I'm always curious about how people basically segment their, their brains to basically say, okay, I'm working on a recording now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> at the moment, they're pretty related and connected. I tried, I'm interested in performing the things that I record with some embellishments or with some variations. So when I record, it's a carefully crafted composition or piece of code, and I will do multiple takes or maybe if I'm lucky, a single take of something <span style="color:red" data-ts="2498.025" data-end_ts="2498.245" title="2498.025" id=c_"2498.025">__to__</span> when I'm pleased with it. And I, I honestly, when I'm doing a recording, the code is more doing more of the talking than, than my typing is. Most of my studio work is static code that's not necessarily live. The, the compositional process is very much live for me as I'm improvising and figuring it out. But the recording itself is, there's a lot less improv going on at that point. I see. But then I will take that composition when my recording maybe remove or scale back some stuff, and then, then that becomes the skeleton, take that live, and then I will add or, or improvise with it. And it may resemble something close to the recording when it's live as well. That's kind of how that works. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's really interesting because in a way that's sort of like, I mean there throughout the history of recording band recordings, right, there's always been two approaches. There's been like the go to the studio, make a thing, and then figure out how to play it live or make up something live, bring it to the studio and document it. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>Yeah. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And, it seems like an awful lot of people in the synth world or in electronic music world, it seems like a lot of people kind of do that second thing if their live performers, the, the live performance really drives what they, they record. It's interesting to hear you talk about kind of taking the reverse approach, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>I suppose. I've never done, I've never done the other approach myself, but yeah. No, I, I guess every live coder is different too. Or every electronic artist is different. There's something in me that, that likes to perform the compositions. And I guess maybe because of my more traditional musical background, that's, you know, you open up the real book and we're gonna play this song. Okay. <laugh>, that's, I guess that's where maybe that some of that, that mentality comes from. Indeed. A quick note, you mentioned my, my band camp page. There is a, another, I guess my latest release was out on a, a different band camp label, called Conditional. Conditional is a fantastic label where they've, they support a lot of innovative and very creative computer artists. I, I guess computer music artists. And it may be, that may include, some modular synth work. It may include live coding, any kind of novel means of computer-based production they're into. So definitely check out conditional. I could add a shameless plug for, for them. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Right, right. It's Conditional Rex, RECS. Yeah, yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>Yeah, yeah. If you or conditional, conditional.club is the website. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2667.835" data-end_ts="2667.995" title="2667.835" id=c_"2667.835">__Oh__</span>, conditional I think. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Got it. And they'll have a link back. Alright. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>Yeah, I think on, on Bandcamp it's actually conditional wrecks. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Got it. Alright, well that certainly is something to dig into. I look forward to listening to more of that. Mike, I want to thank you so much for taking the time to have a chat. This has really been fascinating. It's been great to kind of dig into, dig deep a little bit into both the live coding and the title Cycles world. I really appreciate it, man. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>Yeah, no problem. It was fun. Alright, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well with that, I'm gonna let you have the rest of your day. Thank you so much and have a good one. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Mike: </b>All right, thanks. You too. Bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Many thanks to Mike for hanging out and talking about title cycles. Right after I did the interview, I actually went and had a workshop with him that I mentioned in the discussion. It was great. I learned a lot about this amazing tool and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2727.435" data-end_ts="2727.725" title="2727.435" id=c_"2727.435">__hope__</span> we're using it somewhat more in the future. I want to thank you for continuing to listen. I hope that you're getting something fun out of this. In the meantime, if you have any questions, comments, or ideas, feel free to reach out and let me know. My email is DDG at cycling <span style="color:red" data-ts="2743.965" data-end_ts="2744.445" title="2743.965" id=c_"2743.965">__74__</span> and I'm always glad to hear from you. Thanks a lot and we'll catch you next time around. Bye.
