<b>Darwin: </b>Hey all. Thanks a lot for tuning in. I really appreciate it. I hope that you are having a great December so far. I certainly am Thanks to everybody for helping out with Kickstarter. We've got one stretch goal we have until tomorrow to get it on. That would be to get us to $1,000 on the Kickstarter. If we get there, then I will be doing doubled up podcasts for the rest of the month of December. So if you're into it, if you'd like a little extra podcasting for your holiday enjoyment, please help us get over the top. We're just like, a little over a hundred dollars away from hitting that goal. So if you could help out, it would really be appreciated. This is gonna be great for the podcast and hopefully for the quality of the result. With that, I bring you Paul Burkin. Okay. Today I have a really special guest. This is somebody that we've actually talked about in, one of the previous interviews. When I talked to James Patrick, he brought up this name as being an elemental person in, in his, attack on electronic music. His name's Paul Burkin, and I think in the Midwest area you'd find an awful lot of people that say that he was influential to them. So without me jabbering anymore, let's get right into talking to Paul. Hey, Paul, how are you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul Birken: </b>Now? I'm doing great. Darwin, good to, good to talk to you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thanks a lot. I really appreciate you taking the time to have a chat with me. It's really cool. So let's start off by, having you explain to people who might not know your work. Why don't you tell us a little bit about what you do? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>I would say I am a nearly lifelong dabbler in electronics and, most of that kind of focusing on synthesizers and drum machines and, just the way you can connect modules and, and kind of make a bunch of, bunch of noise and ruckus and somewhat focused. I, I guess in the, in the techno realm as far as musical genres, even though I, I make a lot more than that, the labels and things I work with, that tends to be the outlet that the things I create end up in. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, it's, that's interesting you say it that way because I would say that's how I know of you as, as really sort of like the, almost like a bedrock of the, of the techno community. When you say that you do other kinds of stuff, what, what other work have you been? What other work do you do? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>I've kept this as my hobby. You know, I'm 45 and I kind of started with this stuff, right in my early teens. And because I've kept it a hobby I, any given night when I may sit down to work on something, you know, it may just be some down <span style="color:red" data-ts="177.055" data-end_ts="177.335" title="177.055" id=c_"177.055">__temple__</span> thing or some interesting noise or, just some crazy crazy thing that ends up happening. So I, I don't try to focus too much on writing a specific thing because I'm, like I said, I'm kind of dabbling, in different things. So more so it's just kind of, let's see what this machine can do when I hook it up with some other things and it ends up going down pretty much any kind of avenue <laugh> Sure. That you can imagine it would as, as these machines tend to do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, I think it's kind of interesting that by I mean for this being just a hobby, you're incredibly well <span style="color:red" data-ts="216.485" data-end_ts="216.765" title="216.485" id=c_"216.485">__known__</span> for, for your work, and also you still get quite a draw to do, to do gigs all over the place, don't you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Yeah. It, it's ended up picking up. I've, I have never promoted myself a lot or, kind of pushed it as far as trying to get out there and try to travel all the time. But if, if people would call or were interested and we could sort it out and it worked on the schedule around family things or, work schedule and things like that, then I'm, I'm happy to pack the machines up and, and go play. I think part of that limited number of, of gigs and things I do is because I never learned to dj. And so a lot of venues or parties or things that have gone on, because it's a live performance, they have to try to figure out how to incorporate that <laugh>. Sometimes it's just, it's just easier to get the DJs lined up for the night and maybe not have to give consideration to bring in a live act <span style="color:red" data-ts="271.205" data-end_ts="271.365" title="271.205" id=c_"271.205">__in__</span> and Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="271.995" data-end_ts="272.685" title="271.995" id=c_"271.995">__Accommodate__</span> that. Yeah. Whenever the phone rings or somebody sends a message and says, you want <span style="color:red" data-ts="276.845" data-end_ts="276.885" title="276.845" id=c_"276.845">__to__</span> bring out the machines, I, I try to make it happen. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's, that's wild. Yeah. I, I think I've seen you like maybe twice perform over the years. Okay. And it was, it was one of those things that I found really inspirational just because it is rare to see people who, you know, are pretty much staunchly about the performance and not about DJing. It's, and I think you actually identified something that's kind of key promoters actually like DJs because it's pretty clear what you can expect to show up in the door. Right, right. Where if a live thing comes up, the who knows what direction <span style="color:red" data-ts="314.345" data-end_ts="314.565" title="314.345" id=c_"314.345">__it__</span> can go. <laugh>, you know, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>That, that is true. I, I, I think I'm fortunate because the releases I've done have stayed pretty much in that techno are harder electronic realm. So there's only been a handful of shows where I've been booked specifically for Downtempo in the mid nineties. There were some like early morning sunrise type late night sets Right. And really down tempo things, that I played at, which were fun 'cause it was something different. But it's, my spot tends to be <laugh> middle of the night when the party, the party is going fast and furious. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. It's interesting because, I think of you as one of the people who was really a big part of the Midwest rave scene when it was, when it was flying high. Right? Sure. And I'm a little curious if you can talk about kind of the development of that scene, because it seemed to simultaneously come out of Chicago and Minneapolis and some outta Milwaukee and some outta Detroit. It seemed to kind of like blossom from all of these different centers of, of sound, but each, each town kind of had its own thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Yeah. And, and I think the other interesting thing that kind of was going on in the Midwest is just the proximity of the cities allowed for people to be traveling when they saw an interesting party going on. So you'd have people from Chicago coming up to Minneapolis, or there'd be something going on in Milwaukee would drop base. So people from Minneapolis and Chicago would travel there, depending on the lineups and the way parties were staggered. And it made for a good adventure of just, you know, go to another area, see what's going on, bring some of that back to your area, <laugh>, try to keep stuff going. And I, and I know on the coast, you know, there's stuff going on, but those, those cities in Los Angeles and New York and those areas seemed to be like a single city that had its thing going on and didn't have kind of other flavors moving into it from other areas, which I think some of the Midwest had just because of that, that movement that was going on. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, it was, it was really interesting. Every weekend there seemed to be sort of like a tribal movement to whatever was going to be the place that week, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Yeah. It was the adventure <laugh>, where are we gonna go? What, what, what's gonna happen? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Indeed. Did you ever do any kind of like party promotion or were you always just a performer at parties? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>No, so I was up in Duluth in the early nineties going to UMD Oh, okay. Up there in Duluth. And, so there were little parties starting up there, and I knew the people that were throwing them. So I wasn't really involved with the promotion, but I was involved with kind of seeing how they got 'em together and then coming down to the cities when there were things going on. The first big party I went to in Minneapolis was part of the, stuff that Woody McBride was throwing Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And it was a party called Hell Bent. And that was kind of the eyeopener for me because up to that point through the late eighties and stuff is, I was just listening to more music, the industrial stuff, the electronic, the pop stuff, the hip hop, just all, all these things that were coming out that had a machine feel to them as they were being created. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Right. I hadn't experienced that on a big sound system yet. Yeah. And going, going to a party like that, you know, all through the night on a giant sound system where your, your whole body is just rattled by the sound. That was kind of a turning point where the, even the music I was making, with the drum machines and synths and stuff took a turn more from that mindset where I had, where it's kind of verse and chorus. You're kind of moving through these things to a pure, there's a groove you can make with these machines and just let that ride. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and, and slight fluctuations to that one amplified really have an impact that you don't always notice at lower volumes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, that's really true. And I mean, that's actually true with a lot of kind of music, but it seems like techno is especially the case because sort of the, the focus on repetition becomes really a physical thing once the volume gets ramped up. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Right. And I, you know, I, when I work on this stuff all through the night, and sometimes I think about that, just that, that hypnotic effect it has on myself working on this stuff. And that removal from time where you as you're, you're working on these loops and repetitions of things and just that whole disconnect from, you know, a traditional song where you're listening to it and you feel it moving across the minutes because it's progressing through this certain movement. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you take away lyrics, you take away certain chord changes and certain things that happen that propel you forward, and you suddenly are like, did 10 minutes pass? Did 50 minutes pass as an hour and a half pass? Yeah. Well, how long has this been going? Because you, whatever part of that mind is going on that has that anchor in time breaks away from that at some point. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, that's actually an interesting point. I hadn't thought about that, but, but by sort of like stripping the music down and kind of like moving away from chord changes and stuff, a lot of the things that are cues for time passing kind of get pulled away. Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>That's, and I, I, I, I enjoy the trick. It ends up playing on myself just sometimes when I'm working on stuff and, and I notice something's really interesting and I'll, you know, I don't have a clock sitting there in the studio, but I'll get up to go walk around and suddenly look and <span style="color:red" data-ts="660.085" data-end_ts="660.405" title="660.085" id=c_"660.085">__you're__</span> like, whoa, <laugh>, where <span style="color:red" data-ts="662.285" data-end_ts="662.445" title="662.285" id=c_"662.285">__does__</span> that time go? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The, the time warp <span style="color:red" data-ts="664.265" data-end_ts="664.485" title="664.265" id=c_"664.265">__hit__</span>. Right. <laugh>. One of the things I like doing on my podcast is talking to people about how they got to be the artist that they are. I'm really curious about you, because you actually talk about, you know, you talk just now about having sort of like a, a music making time before you started going to parties where you were doing one thing and then all of a sudden this switched your head. How did you first get into music? And then this one party was kind of a turning point, but were there artists or were there, was there like somebody who kinda like pulled you to the side <span style="color:red" data-ts="698.405" data-end_ts="698.605" title="698.405" id=c_"698.405">__and__</span> said, Hey kid, let me show you something. Or <laugh>, or was there a machine that like, turned your head? There 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Were quite a few. I, I guess I would look at them as pivot points. Okay. Where I had changes in my perspective about things just at a really young age. My parents had, one of those Kimble home organs had all the rocker switches on it. Right. Pedals. And, you know, I'm 5, 6, 7 years old, so I, you know, I can stand on the base pedals and the speakers are right in front of me. So I'm just <laugh> getting blasted with these tones as I'm standing on these, these pedals, which was great fun. And just, you know, making a noise on there. And it's, it's like a Fisher-Price toy almost with all those rocker switches and buttons and Right. So that, that <span style="color:red" data-ts="746.845" data-end_ts="747.005" title="746.845" id=c_"746.845">__was__</span>, that was a point of just experimentation that I was free to just play on. And, as I got older and just took, you know, kind of some standard music lessons and learned to play some stuff in school band and things like that, I could, I could learn to play some things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>But moving up, I guess to when I was about 12, 13, the music and stuff that I was listening to, this was the mid eighties and maybe around 85, 86, I had already come through, you know, my youth having arcades and things with just all these crazy sounds. I try to explain it to my kids sometimes. Like, you don't understand these arcades and things you would go into just the cacophony of noise and sound that were in these places. And how just disorienting at times it was <laugh> with, with all this stuff going on on. But it was really interesting. And music and stuff on the radio that I was listening to was all a lot of the European Pop Depeche mode and Human League. And, just being drawn, you know, to the synthesizer sounds and things that I heard in there. I had, some music lessons I was taking through Schmidt music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And this was just simple, you know, piano and like comping chords and things from a jazz fake book Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, stuff like that that they teach. But my teacher, Marty Weintraub was involved in all sorts of pop music. He was college roommates at Berkeley with Steve <span style="color:red" data-ts="837.465" data-end_ts="837.685" title="837.465" id=c_"837.465">__Vi__</span> the guitarist. And when he found out I was interested in syn and stuff, 'cause I was talking about this, you know, I'd say, you know, this Van Halen song came out and there's this crazy synthesizer and stuff, and I had one of those little Yamaha porta sounds, you know, from Best Buy that has the little 100 sound preset banks in it. <span style="color:red" data-ts="855.605" data-end_ts="855.805" title="855.605" id=c_"855.605">__Right__</span>. And, and I said, I have this synthesizer. And he's like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="858.205" data-end_ts="858.405" title="858.205" id=c_"858.205">__that__</span>, that's not a synthesizer. You know, <laugh>, this is a synthesizer. And then Schmidt Music had a few synths in their little showroom there that Roland was putting out, but there was a, a Roland Synthesizer convention that came to Hopkins, and there was an ad in the Sunday paper and I asked my dad if we could go check this thing out. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, he brought me there and they did all their demos. And it was right when they were releasing, all the new samplers, like the S 50 sampler. Oh, right. And, you know, they're playing animal sounds and breaking glass. And it's clicking in my head that these are how these songs that I'm hearing where they're incorporating all these noises and things, they're starting, this must be the stuff that they're using. And so I got all excited and, you know, they finished their spiel and I'm asking my dad like, can I get one of these? Can I get one of these? You know, this is great. I'm super psyched up. And, and he goes, yeah, pick anything you want. So I start nearly jumping outta my chair and I almost didn't hear him finish the sentence, which was just get a job, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, geez. Yeah. Which 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Was the perfect, you know Right. Teenage learning point here for him. Like, you're excited you can have anything. Just, you know, work for it. <laugh> work 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Hard. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Yeah. But that started, you know, the process of the afterschool fast food jobs and hunting the Sunday classifieds for used year. I got a <span style="color:red" data-ts="948.685" data-end_ts="948.845" title="948.685" id=c_"948.685">__role__</span> in TR 5 0 5. That was my first drum machine that was, I think, $75 <span style="color:red" data-ts="953.425" data-end_ts="953.645" title="953.425" id=c_"953.425">__in__</span> the Sunday classifieds there. And this was around Twin Cities here, down in Burnsville. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So that was a kind of ongoing process for a few years in my early teens there of work, saved the money, find a machine, save up for it, and figure out what it could do. I did have a Commodore 64, which my parents had gotten my brother and I for Christmas a few years earlier. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And we were working on those. And then, I was also getting Keyboard magazine at the time, and I saw an ad for, I think it was Dr. T's sequencer, <laugh>, which had a 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Dr t can't believe I almost forgot about that. <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Dr. T's Yeah. With the, the 16 track sequencer. Yeah. And so I had, by this point gotten, I think this was around 87, 88. The, the role in D 10 had just come out. And so this multi <span style="color:red" data-ts="1008.975" data-end_ts="1009.325" title="1008.975" id=c_"1008.975">__timal__</span> synth and, I got this cartridge and I think, I think I went to Newt <span style="color:red" data-ts="1014.825" data-end_ts="1015.045" title="1014.825" id=c_"1014.825">__Kpe__</span>, the music stores there and, and got this thing and just started doing sequencing, which was fascinating to me that I could suddenly start playing all these parts. 'cause up to this point, I, you know, I would have a drum machine going and just be playing some notes and things and didn't really have a way to get a bunch of parts all going together if I couldn't play 'em, you know, over the beat. So that I remember that point where I can suddenly just start writing all these parts. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> being really eye-opening. And I think then around as I, around 1990, then I was graduating high school and going off to college and still accumulating machines and just playing them. Just my exposure to music at that point, since I could now drive and going to Northern Lights and all these other record stores around the Twin Cities. Just really expanding the amount of music I was listening to. And then trying to incorporate ways to play this type of stuff. So if I'm listening to, you know, all the wax track stuff that was pouring in a lot of the, the hip hop stuff was really interesting. And the pop stuff, not so much at that point. 'cause I, the harder sounds and things were more interesting just because they were new as I was listening to them. But then up in Duluth for a few years, just, just working on things until those kind of other parties started going, which was that turning point. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So I guess that that's kind of a long <laugh> long running that's long running path. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's pretty interesting. Now, you know, first of all, I'd say one of the parallels between you and me is my first electronic instrument was also a TR 5 0 5. Okay. And I am surprised that both you and I survived that experience <laugh>, because that was a partic peculiarly bad sounding drum machine. I thought 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>It was, but it was very easy to program. It was, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1129.245" data-end_ts="1129.405" title="1129.245" id=c_"1129.245">__yeah__</span>. I mean, having the, there weren't, there weren't many menus to dig through. Right. And I do remember figuring out the MIDI notes that it could send out and having that trigger the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1140.355" data-end_ts="1140.645" title="1140.355" id=c_"1140.355">__head__</span> of sequential circuit six track. Oh, okay. And being able to feed specific midi note numbers and realizing that the 5 0 5 could actually be a real rudimentary sequencer sequencer. Right. If you, if you only play those specific notes in different orders <span style="color:red" data-ts="1154.695" data-end_ts="1155.045" title="1154.695" id=c_"1154.695">__Right__</span>. Patterns would trigger it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. You have to be, you have to be happy with those, those 12 or 16 notes. Right. <laugh>, that's funny. So you were kind of early in the game of sort of like classified ad surfing. Was that, that was during the time when people were like dumping out of a lot of their analog stuff to get the cool digital too, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Yes. So, and, and this is kind of funny because, you know, I, I had gotten a saved up from working and, and bought myself a car by the time I was 16. So on weekends, I was making the, the drive around to the pawn shops. And, a lot of these places around the metro that just kind of went by the wayside. But there was <span style="color:red" data-ts="1197.605" data-end_ts="1197.725" title="1197.605" id=c_"1197.605">__a__</span>, a place in Bloomington that had a 3 0 3 for, I wanna say it was $85 Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And it was there, it was there. I would go in there all the time and see it there. And I never picked it up because it didn't have midi <span style="color:red" data-ts="1211.545" data-end_ts="1211.765" title="1211.545" id=c_"1211.545">__Oh__</span>, right. It had <span style="color:red" data-ts="1212.565" data-end_ts="1212.845" title="1212.565" id=c_"1212.565">__zinc__</span> and I already had a 2 0 2, one of my dad's coworkers had it when it came out. And then, he, he knew that I was interested in music <span style="color:red" data-ts="1222.525" data-end_ts="1222.725" title="1222.525" id=c_"1222.525">__and__</span> said, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1222.955" data-end_ts="1223.245" title="1222.955" id=c_"1222.955">__does__</span> your son wanna buy this for $50? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Uhhuh <affirmative>? So I had bought it and then I, you know, it would never syn with anything because I didn't have any dint <span style="color:red" data-ts="1230.885" data-end_ts="1231.005" title="1230.885" id=c_"1230.885">__syn__</span> equipment. So I would just program sounds on it and play a manual on the little rubber keyboard. Right. So I saw, I saw this 3 0 3, I think Burns music was the place. It didn't have midi and I think Woody McBride may have picked that one up here in the Twin Cities early on after it sat there for a while. But I remember it being there for a long time. I just kept looking at it like, ah, if it only had midi, then I could play that little <span style="color:red" data-ts="1253.705" data-end_ts="1253.925" title="1253.705" id=c_"1253.705">__pin__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Yeah. Well, it's funny, I mean, Woody is kind of notorious for having been like the world's biggest, 3 0 3 hog too. Right. He just had an enormous number of three oh threes over this time. Like, you were first turned on by these samplers. Did you ever get into sampling or did you move into synthesis pretty quickly? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>No, I kind of had both going on. I had gotten, the MKS 100, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1280.965" data-end_ts="1281.005" title="1280.965" id=c_"1280.965">__ro__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1281.005" data-end_ts="1281.205" title="1281.005" id=c_"1281.005">__and__</span> rack version of the S 10 Uhhuh <affirmative>, which would only hold four samples, and it had those little quick disks. Right. Which are tough to track down, but I, I had that and would record little pieces in, I remember when I bought that it was used, but it came, some of the quick disks had sounds and someone had sampled the Sounds from Yeses owner of a Lonely Heart <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And so I remember impressing all my friends by being able to load that up and play those sounds back off there. Right. Over and over. And then, another friend and I would just make home movies. He was one of the first people I knew in the, late eighties who had just a home VHS deck, the big huge one with the camcorder attached. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1324.645" data-end_ts="1324.845" title="1324.645" id=c_"1324.645">__Right__</span>. That was the size of a boombox. Right. And, we would make these little stop motion movies and things, and using that sampler could pitch our voices down. Okay. Try to do different voice things with these little <span style="color:red" data-ts="1335.975" data-end_ts="1336.325" title="1335.975" id=c_"1335.975">__movie__</span> home movies and things we were making. So it, it was fun. The sampler stuff that I did was more from a novelty aspect of just like, how can this mess it up? I, I don't remember using that in any songwriting for the most part, just because it was so limited Sure. With the amount of sample time Right. At that point. And I hadn't figured out how to, through sequencing creatively, do some more things with that. But as time went on, then the samplers came more into play because it was more interesting, you know, to run stuff through effects and put it back into the sampler and go down that whole route before resampling became so easy within the machines. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Once you got outta school and once you started getting involved in doing more performance and stuff, what ended up being kind of your tools of choice 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>For a long time? The Kauai Q 80 sequencer was the brain of the setup because it had 32 tracks. So I had started with an MMT eight. I remember getting one of those Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and I liked that, but that to, to be able to play for over an hour, which is those eight Yeah. Tracks of stuff running was somewhat limited. And when I found the Q 80 and found that each of those 32 tracks could all be different lengths of loops running. Okay. Then that, that became, and you could, you know, just move through all the tracks and turn 'em on or off mute 'em in or out. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>That, that became a kind of a main piece. And it was really fast to write in quantizing and it was good, the step writing, and it was good. It would hold everything in memory after you powered it off. So you didn't really need to save anything to disks. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, and they were cheap. I mean, I remember getting those over the years. They were like a hundred dollars. People didn't, people didn't want 'em. And then really just moving to Rack since the 2 0 2 kind of stayed in there with me because it's a very hands-on little machine. I had learned to program that sequencer really early on, because that was one of the few machines I had. Right. And so that menu driven program of putting in pitches, putting in those gate <span style="color:red" data-ts="1467.125" data-end_ts="1467.365" title="1467.125" id=c_"1467.125">__time__</span> steps, putting in your accent slides, everything like that, that was never too confusing just because I, I had so much time to sit and figure it out Right. Early on. So I remember using that, it shows and because it would only hold the two sequences in memory, you know, putting something in and then powering it off <laugh>, powering it back on, and writing something on there quick while other stuff was going right. And then, you know, stopping the sequence, starting it up to get it resynced and bringing it back in with something else. So that, that was kind of an early on machine that I brought around everywhere. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's interesting 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1502.245" data-end_ts="1502.485" title="1502.245" id=c_"1502.245">__Because__</span> I, I knew it so well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That, to me, the 2 0 2 was, that was like one of the first machines where I wanted to like it a lot more than I could. I think I didn't have, there was something about that means of entry that I just didn't have the patience for it. Right. Which is, which is funny because there were other senses that were a lot more obscure that I could dive into, but for some reason there was something about that just, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>It's a quirky box. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Indeed. In a way, at that time, an awful lot of the boxes were quirky. Whether it's, you know, I think of like, some of the stuff that I was using around that time <span style="color:red" data-ts="1542.345" data-end_ts="1542.565" title="1542.345" id=c_"1542.345">__is__</span> like the, for example, the, the six track is a really good example. You know, you could Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> sort of get multi Tamil stuff, but it was outrageously painful to actually go down that path too much, you know? Yeah. Or 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Like, jumping <span style="color:red" data-ts="1558.725" data-end_ts="1559.125" title="1558.725" id=c_"1558.725">__through__</span> all those parameters trying to find your way <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Around <span style="color:red" data-ts="1561.985" data-end_ts="1562.205" title="1561.985" id=c_"1561.985">__in__</span> there. I know, right. And, and it would sound great, but it was like there was this trade-off and you could kind of see the music industry, the instrument industry kind of struggling with what to do, because in one hand they had this experience and they had this kind of internal sense that people want to have their hands on the sound, but at the same time they would watch people in a store play and they just wanted to punch through presets. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And, so you'd end up with things like the, the six track or the multi-track, you know, from Sequential or like the MOG source or whatever, where it's like, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1602.585" data-end_ts="1602.805" title="1602.585" id=c_"1602.585">__Ooh__</span>, it was, it sounded good and it had a lot of those great elemental sounds, but wow. It was kind of hard to, hard to interact with 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b><laugh>. I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1614.565" data-end_ts="1614.685" title="1614.565" id=c_"1614.565">__look__</span>, I looked at some old pictures that I had found of some early live shows I was doing around Duluth and things. And I, I was bringing out I think three full-size keyboards <laugh> at the time. And, and an a-frame stand, like an A X 60 and a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1628.125" data-end_ts="1628.325" title="1628.125" id=c_"1628.125">__Chi__</span> A <span style="color:red" data-ts="1628.565" data-end_ts="1628.685" title="1628.565" id=c_"1628.565">__X__</span> 60 God. And, and the S 10 sampler, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1631.685" data-end_ts="1631.965" title="1631.685" id=c_"1631.685">__which__</span> full-size keyboard. Right. That was short-lived <span style="color:red" data-ts="1634.855" data-end_ts="1635.205" title="1634.855" id=c_"1634.855">__since__</span> I could start finding rack versions of things because the way I, I write, you know, I only need one controller and then move through the tracks and just trigger everything. One other machine, I, I just remembered all of a sudden that I did use a lot, and actually I've come back to again lately, is the Roland R 70, the drum machine? Oh, yeah. Because it had the backlit screen and the step entry on it compared to the R eight Yeah. At the time, or like the R five, the little sibling. But, and it had both the 9 0 9 and 8 0 8 sounds in it without the cards that you needed. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>The R eight. But, because it was backlit and you could write a bunch of patterns and just the step editing, being able to edit the pitches, the, the nuance, the gate times on each individual step Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you do a lot of melodic writing on there, and it was really fast to work in. So that one for live performances too kind of traveled with me everywhere. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's interesting because that whole kind of series of drum machines from Rolands, the, the only selling feature that they ever pushed was their, like humanized functions. Right. <laugh>, you know, I remember with that, with the R eight, which was really a quite a capable sequencing drum machine. Oh yeah. But you would never hear anyone talk about anything other than the humanized function. Right. Which is, I always, I listened to it and I was like, wow, okay. It makes it sound more like a bad drum machine. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Right. <laugh>, I, if you don't want it nice and rigid, that cool machine sounds, then you can have it get a little sloppy. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I guess <laugh> sorta <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>So something for the marketing groups to be able to write up. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I guess now, I, I really can't remember what I would've seen you perform on, but as you progressed into different gear setups, did you ever get into things like, you know, kind of the standards of the techno world? So like the, the 9 0 9, because you kind of did harder edge techno? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>So did I did, but I never had the, the real machines Really. So, because I had those sounds in the R 70 mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, that was good. I had a Studio four 40 for a while. Oh. And so I had a bunch of the kits sampled up in there Interesting. That I could play. And then, you know, sequence a lot of the pitch changes and things with the knob movements and things that that machine could do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's interesting. Tell me about, you know, I have had my hands, I, I've like owned so much of the history of, of electron music over time. That is like the platinum unicorn as far as I can tell. I have never been able to get my hands on one. I think that they were, you know, really limited releases anyway. But, what, what was that like to work with? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>It was, it was just a really great sounding machine I think that had the same 12 bit sampling engine that like the profit 2000 had. Yeah. Which 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I loved. I loved the sound. Yeah. Great. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Great filter. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And just, I, I never was able to get my hands on sp 1200 mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And so that box to me, the four 40 was kind of get the sound in. You've got hands <span style="color:red" data-ts="1831.265" data-end_ts="1831.485" title="1831.265" id=c_"1831.265">__on__</span> control of the knobs being able to manipulate, which up to that point, the samplers that I had, all the rolling stuff, you couldn't really do much other than whatever you could assign, you know, pitch to the mod wheel or something you could sequence. Right. Or just menu diving, some manipulation. Everything that I was able to do with those other samplers was, you know, run it through some sort of effects and modulate the effects or do do something of that manner, which was more kind of haphazard and cool accidents may happen, but the four 40 being able to sequence actual pitch changes, filter changes, just a lot more hands-on control of the sound and being able to play it off the pads in a way that felt a lot different than, you know, triggering off keys. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, which I'd done up to that point. So I, I just remember playing on it was a whole different feel compared to just what I'd had to up at that point. You know, the, like the Q 80 hooked up to the, the S 10 or something like that, which is very rigid and 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and it's also very keyboard oriented where the four 40 would've taken you in the direction of pad programming. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Yeah. And I remember being able to hold, you know, almost like a roll function where you're locking <span style="color:red" data-ts="1906.565" data-end_ts="1906.685" title="1906.565" id=c_"1906.565">__a__</span>, a repeat rate of eight noss or 16 or something as you're manipulating the sample. That very mechanical movement of the sound was, was very interesting. 'cause it just, I hadn't been able to, to utilize that functionality in anything else. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Did you ever get into using MPCs at all? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Oh yeah. I, I worked through all, I came into that right when the MPC 2000 Right. Arrived Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and I moved into that with all the zip discs and <laugh> scuzzy magic. Right. But then, then the Excel and then when the 1000 arrived, got the JJOS and that's still here in my studio getting used all the time. Is it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>That was, that was really easy for travel too. Yeah, I mean that's kind of the perfect size to throw in the backpack as the brain up until I got the Okta <span style="color:red" data-ts="1954.205" data-end_ts="1954.405" title="1954.205" id=c_"1954.205">__Track__</span>. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and some of the newer electron stuff, the, the MPC 1000 was pretty much for a decade, you know, the box. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Yeah. I used one for a long time. I just talked to Freddy Fresh and he talked about how that was his like, traveling machine as well, so 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Yeah. And he, he's got the 4,000 in his studio kind of as the, the brain that he's the, the master of. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Although <span style="color:red" data-ts="1980.305" data-end_ts="1980.525" title="1980.305" id=c_"1980.305">__the__</span> 4,000 is funny to me because it, you sit in front of it and it's almost like you're sitting in front of the hood of a Buick or something. It's so huge <laugh>. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Gives you room to work on it though. <laugh>. Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I guess if you, if you have like long arms, maybe <laugh>. Right. <laugh>. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>So I, I've seen him work on it. He, he's, he's good. He's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Fast. Yeah. Yeah. I'll bet. I've noticed in a lot of photos that you have seemed to like dive into the electron world. And I, I tend to see people when they, when they dip their toes into Electron, one of two things happens. Either they get into Electron and it's like, oh my God, this speaks to my soul. Or Oh my God, this thing was invented on Saturn. You know? Yeah. And it seems like you, you took to it pretty well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>I got the original machine drum 2002 mm-Hmm. <affirmative> when they announced that was coming out and I read the specs on it. My big thing, you know, I get excited about machines where you can move between pattern play and Right. Without having to stop anything. Right. And also being able to shift the pattern that's running, left and right on the grid. Okay. So it realigns against other patterns and grooves that are running. 'cause a lot of times you'll write something and then you're like, ah, it's, you know, it's a quarter beat off <laugh> where it should be. Let's, let's try to, let's nudge it over. Reprogram it is. Yeah. As I got used to over the years on, you know, on the MPCs, like, all right, I gotta, I guess, reprogram this right to be over, just <span style="color:red" data-ts="2077.635" data-end_ts="2077.835" title="2077.635" id=c_"2077.635">__copy__</span> it a bunch of times and then recut it <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>But yeah, the, the electron stuff when I started with the machine drum, having that ability to move around the grid and shift your beats, I liked the workflow. I remember after a show the, the heat sink broke off inside it and I got home and went to plug it in. I heard all this clunking around in it and ended up having to send it back. But they, they repaired it. And I had that up until I remember getting the sampler upgrade for it when they offered that user wave. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> sent it off to get that upgrade. That was really cool, being able to get some of my own sounds in there, run stuff into it, even though it wasn't much sampling time. It was, it was a nice expansion. And then when the Okta <span style="color:red" data-ts="2118.675" data-end_ts="2118.875" title="2118.675" id=c_"2118.675">__track__</span> was announced, that seemed like a pretty cool expansion on what I had been using up to that point with the machine drum. Right. And being able to, you know, run eight tracks of sequencing with MIDI stuff and be able to load in a bunch of samples. My only gripe really with the Okta tracks that they didn't put eight outputs on it. Yeah. Because I, I could never figure out, you know, four is okay, you can use the cues as the outputs and hard pan the stuff and do that, but I, that, that's been a mystery to me why that machine <laugh> didn't get that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, yeah. Because you end up having to use those little tweezing onscreen mixer, which Right. Yeah. That's, it's interesting though. So did you do any of the interim stuff, like the mono machine or, or any of that stuff? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>No. And, and that was really because I was pretty much stocked on the syn and I had had the Nord lead Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>A rack version with the four outs. And that's such a workhorse. Right. Which I still use that when the mono machine came out, I, I didn't feel that I needed to get that one. I was kind of intrigued by the original one that had the, the unit to the side of the giant keyboard. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>But, you know, I had, I had suddenly memories of carting around full <span style="color:red" data-ts="2196.265" data-end_ts="2196.685" title="2196.265" id=c_"2196.265">__sights__</span> Yeah. Keyboards to gigs and it was like, nah, not again passed on that one. But then when the rhythm showed up and, the A four and that was, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Are you using all of those? Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>I've got all three. And actually I just picked up the, the digit <span style="color:red" data-ts="2210.285" data-end_ts="2210.445" title="2210.285" id=c_"2210.285">__attack__</span>. Yeah. I was just, 'cause I wanted to compare it, compare it to the rhythm and see workflow on it and things like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And what do you think 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>I, I'm enjoying it. I've taken it out to three or four gigs now and it hasn't blown up <laugh>, that's a good sign and it sounds great on the system. You know, muting sounds, being able to move around and edit stuff while it's running. That's pretty much, I'm really happy these days. You know, pretty much everything you buy, you get a worldwide power supply that you can plug in anywhere. Right. You just throw different plug on the end of it. But, you know, they're all switching power supply. So all the, all the issues that used to be around before to travel around with your stuff have Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> pretty much gone away. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. So, I'm curious about something, you know, almost everybody that I talk to who's not doing music longs to be like a professional musician. <laugh>, you have been really public in saying that that was never a goal of yours. And Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And, and sometimes I think about that. I mean, I, it seemed, you know, I'm, I'm certainly interested in it every day, Uhhuh, <affirmative>. But I, I think when, when I think about, you know, why wouldn't I want to do that? I think there's some part of my mind that because I enjoy it so much and I have such free reign and, whenever I sit down, I can kind of work on whatever I want. There's some part of my mind that has that thought that I don't wanna feel like using this thing that I enjoy so much at some point would feel like, all right, now I need to make this type of song because the rent is due. Or I need to buy food. Or I may need to take and go do this gig because I have bills to pay when I would rather, you know, do this with my family or something like that. Yeah. It's, it's just I haven't, I haven't felt lacking in anything with music projects or anything like that. And so I think that's what's kind of kept that at bay all these decades is that it, it's always there whenever I wanna sit down with it. So I don't feel I'm, I'm missing out, I guess on opportunities. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Interesting. Well, when I talked to Fred Fresh <span style="color:red" data-ts="2345.685" data-end_ts="2345.885" title="2345.685" id=c_"2345.685">__here__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2345.885" data-end_ts="2346.005" title="2345.885" id=c_"2345.885">__the__</span> other day, he said that you and he are gonna be playing a gig pretty soon in Denver when you go off and do a gig. Now, what do you take with you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>So my, my rig these days is whatever I can fit in two carry-on backpacks <laugh>. So after, after horror shows in the past of checking, rack travel cases and things into airplanes, only to get home and open them up and have the pieces fall out. 'cause the rack <span style="color:red" data-ts="2374.605" data-end_ts="2374.805" title="2374.605" id=c_"2374.605">__ears__</span> broke off. Right. Oh my God. Yeah. So what what I have now is two of those old m audio, those black rectangle backpacks. Yeah, yeah. You know, perfect. Carry on. They fit right in the overhead, under the seat if need be. But those are like clown cars. I can, I can <span style="color:red" data-ts="2390.665" data-end_ts="2390.885" title="2390.665" id=c_"2390.665">__fit__</span> like 20 pieces of gear in those things. All tabletop machines. And all I check then is a, a bag with all of the power supplies, audio cables, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2403.325" data-end_ts="2403.605" title="2403.325" id=c_"2403.325">__media__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2403.625" data-end_ts="2403.845" title="2403.625" id=c_"2403.625">__or__</span> ding cables so that that bag gets checked that they can throw around and the machines stay with me. Got it. The main things I bring are usually, some of the electron boxes. I have a little eide, the time factor delay Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> that travels around robust. My brain for the clock is the little rolling SBX one. The little new 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Clock brain. That, that's the tempo for everything that I can control from one spot. Okay. And I've got, it's got a, because it has two outputs, this guy in Ukraine makes these little split cables that are each one to four. Okay. So I plug, I have two of those. So I, I basically get eight machines all getting clocked at the same time, so there's no chains or anything. Right. And, couple other little random boxes. Sometimes I bring the modular out if it's a local show. I don't really, I flew to the Czech Republic last year, the modular Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> for a weekend, which was fun. But most of the time I'm making noises and stuff. And then just putting long sound chains into the Octa <span style="color:red" data-ts="2473.335" data-end_ts="2473.535" title="2473.335" id=c_"2473.335">__track__</span> Okay. That I can trigger off and do step locks and things like that to Right. Get other sounds and things like that. But a few drum machines, the little t rro nine. The little 9 0 9 reissue that Roland just put out that it's easy to travel. It sounds really good on a rig. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>A lot of people are really enjoying that box. Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b><affirmative>. It's fun. I, I play it in the studio off the MPC Uhhuh. It's really fun to play off the pads and sequence. Oh, it's a little tight with the buttons Yeah. On there. But playing it, the, you know, the midi control is really good on it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So Well, and people that are taking machines out, nobody can afford to take a 9 0 9 out anymore. My God. That costs as much as a down payment on a house. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Well, and you see people leaving their drinks all over the table nearby and then you just assume, you know, something 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Bad's gonna 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Happen. I can replace a $300 drum machine on a $2,000 box. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, indeed. Do you ever, do you take any of your older gear out with you at all? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>The 2 0 2 sometimes comes out still, but for the size, that's still a little big when I'm cramming stuff in the backpacks. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So I've got the little, grendel since the RA nine. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2544.775" data-end_ts="2545.125" title="2544.775" id=c_"2544.775">__Right__</span>. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>A great sounding box. Has a couple filters on it that really howls, that one's kind of fun to play with. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's interesting. I never even <span style="color:red" data-ts="2553.345" data-end_ts="2553.765" title="2553.345" id=c_"2553.345">__filled__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>That <span style="color:red" data-ts="2554.045" data-end_ts="2554.165" title="2554.045" id=c_"2554.045">__take__</span>. Got the, the little acid eight. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>That's a fun little machine. Right. I got the, I have the TT 3 0 3, the base <span style="color:red" data-ts="2562.625" data-end_ts="2562.845" title="2562.625" id=c_"2562.625">__bot__</span>, and then I sent that off, overseas. There's a guy that does the devilfish mods. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> to, to the clone. Oh 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Wow. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>So I bring that out just 'cause it has a lot of options. Now. He added a bunch of other patch points and things on it for CV control. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I'm wishing that and who knows, maybe someone's done it and I just wasn't paying attention. I wish somebody would do a, a new version of the 6 0 6. 'cause you talked before about liking the switch between play and program mode on the fly. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And that was one of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2595.005" data-end_ts="2595.045" title="2595.005" id=c_"2595.005">__the__</span> things I always liked with the 6 0 6 was just moving back and forth between those two functions. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2599.405" data-end_ts="2599.605" title="2599.405" id=c_"2599.405">__Right__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>The, the company that did the base, the space <span style="color:red" data-ts="2601.965" data-end_ts="2602.165" title="2601.965" id=c_"2601.965">__bot__</span> TT 3 0 3, they have the 6 0 6. They, they didn't put it in the silver box though. They changed it to a kind of a crazy plasticy looking Oh. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2610.525" data-end_ts="2610.685" title="2610.525" id=c_"2610.525">__Word__</span> form factor. Oh, okay. But it did, but it is a 6 0 6, but I haven't played on that one. Yeah. I saw 'em post up on it. I don't, I don't think it was well received yet. Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2619.105" data-end_ts="2619.325" title="2619.105" id=c_"2619.105">__Or__</span> maybe just not enough people have checked it out. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Maybe. Well, the other thing is the 6 0 6, I mean, in comparison to a lot of other stuff is still kind of affordable, I guess. Right. Very interesting stuff. So I'm curious then, it, it seems like you have such a relaxed view of all of this stuff, which is kind of interesting and it's kind of unique among the people I've talked to where you don't seem to be stressed about what either the past looked like or what the future's gonna look like. But at the same time, you <span style="color:red" data-ts="2651.805" data-end_ts="2652.085" title="2651.805" id=c_"2651.805">__didn't__</span> do an enormous amount of work. I challenge anyone to go out to band camp and to find somebody that matches your output. You've got a big old stack of stuff out there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>It's been fun to, to post it up there now so people can get at it. Yeah. Right. I mean, that, that's one of the, I think, really interesting things just about the time is that in the past with the distributors and things like that and these kind of limited channels Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> of output. I always wonder, you know, how different would the seeing things be if things had shifted by 20 years? And, you know, as things were just emerging, they had a more of a wider expansive audience to receive everything as it was coming out instead of just, you know, these specific clubs that were first introducing things by the DJs that were playing there at that point. But I don't, I don't dwell on that too much. You know, it's just like, this is where we are right now. This is what's available. This is, I'm, I'm a pretty curious person. So on any given day there's a wide range of things that I want to explore and try to figure out and Right. Keeps every <span style="color:red" data-ts="2714.245" data-end_ts="2714.445" title="2714.245" id=c_"2714.245">__day__</span>, every day. Interesting. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's interesting because, you know, you were running the tone record label for a while and one of the problems with that would be that if my, if I wanted to get it from a local store, I had to hope to be there for the three days between when it came in and when it would sell out and, and you'd never get a chance to see that stuff again. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>The limited window. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. It's really interesting to really have access to all this stuff and so kind of, you know, thanks for putting that stuff out there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Well, I figure it's, it's kind of my safeguard because if my hard drives blow up here, as they will at some point, <laugh>, <laugh>, I know I've got it uploaded there and, hopefully they have more robust backup than I have going on with my couple drives here getting copied every once in a while. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, so now that you talk about kind of like every day and kind of going late into the nights working on stuff, what are your, what are your future plans for doing releases? Do you plan on, keep on, 'cause you kind of work in collaboration with people, you do remixes with people, but it just seems like you, again, you have this kind of like laid back and relaxed attitude about doing stuff. What 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Is it? I, I try to say, I try to say yes whenever, whenever I can. <laugh> nice. But really what, what has happened over the years, because I've had to juggle this with everything, my kind of process, which I is maybe different than the way other people do it. You know, in, in the early days when I was recording to dat, you had to sit down and flesh out the whole track and get it recorded before you did anything else because that, that was it. That's how 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It went. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Oh. And write other stuff and recall and pull everything up. So my workflow process now is on any given night I will be doing one of three things. I will either just be kind of noodling and doing sound creation. So I'll sit down on the modular or a synth or something and not trying to work on anything specific. Just see where it goes. Make a bunch of noises and stuff and just let it go and let it stream just to stereo recording. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And then on another night when I have some time, time I will go back through all those raw things and listen and cut, basically cut out everything that I think is interesting. Right. So I'm basically making my own sound banks. Got it. Again, not with any particular, like this needs to be for this, it's just relax. That's interesting. Let's save that <affirmative>, throw everything else away. And so then when I sit down and the label says, do you have a track or something? Or I'm like, I wanna work on a song. I've gotten rid of that usual, I guess stopping or block where you're like, I need to find a sound. I like, I need to get a beat that I like. I've already got stuff sitting there that I've worked through and said, I like this. Now let's drop it in a machine and just bang out the song. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And so that allows me, because I'm working in those different spots to just kind of keep moving through stuff and then when labels ask, I can give them what I've got and if they want it, good If not, no big deal. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. That's, that's awesome. That's a great working mechanism. I like it. Alright, well Paul, we've burned through our time. Thank you so much for taking the time to chat with me. I really appreciate it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Oh thanks. Thanks for inviting me along. It was a good time. The hour went quite fast. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, it did. Well it's, and it's kind of great to talk not only about like the past, but like also what working is now. It's, it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2933.145" data-end_ts="2933.365" title="2933.145" id=c_"2933.145">__it__</span>, it's interesting to see how you've kind of kept your inspiration throughout the whole thing. It's been doing this a long time man. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Yeah. Hopefully. Hopefully I'm just getting started. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, indeed. I agree. <laugh>. Alright man. With that, I'll let you go. Have a great one. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Thanks Darwin. Alright, bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So if you haven't gotten a chance to listen to Pulper and stuff, hopefully this podcast gives you a reason to go out and check out his stuff. He's got a bunch of stuff on Bandcamp. He's got some stuff on Spotify. You can track his work down. It's amazing. It's that, kind of pure hard edge techno that just in a way has its own singing of the soul. It's great stuff. He's always been an inspiration to me. I know he is been inspiring to a lot of other people that have been on the podcast. I hope that you, get into his work. In any case, thank you so much for hanging out, listening, sharing this with your friends. Thanks to everybody who's supported the Kickstarter. If you haven't yet, please feel free to jump on over and give a shot at the Kickstarter <span style="color:red" data-ts="3005.445" data-end_ts="3005.565" title="3005.445" id=c_"3005.445">__and__</span> get us over the top. We get over that thousand mark. Then I've committed to doing doubled up podcasts, so that should be a lot of fun. Help, while away the holidays. If you have any questions, comments, whatever, gimme drop me a line DDG at cycling <span style="color:red" data-ts="3020.765" data-end_ts="3021.285" title="3020.765" id=c_"3020.765">__74__</span> or <span style="color:red" data-ts="3021.485" data-end_ts="3023.285" title="3021.485" id=c_"3021.485">__darwin.Gross@gmail.com__</span>.
