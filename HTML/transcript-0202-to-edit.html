<b>Darwin: </b>So for those of you in the US this is a little Thanksgiving treat from the Art Music Technology Podcast. For those of you outside, just assume that we're thankful, for something. Thanks a lot for listening and enjoy this interview with Jason <span style="color:red" data-ts="29.405" data-end_ts="29.765" title="29.405" id=c_"29.405">__Quarter__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today I have the great pleasure of getting to talk to somebody who I've actually bumped into in the past. I didn't realize it, but he pointed it out to me when we were having some discussions. His name's Jason <span style="color:red" data-ts="46.245" data-end_ts="46.645" title="46.245" id=c_"46.245">__Quarter__</span>. He goes by a number of different names. Where I have heard of him most recently is under the name Off the Sky, but he's, worked under a lot of different names. He's also got a variety of different things he does. So rather than me Jabber about it, let's talk to Jason. Hey, Jason, how's it going? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason Corder: </b>Good. Good. Thanks for having me. <span style="color:red" data-ts="68.465" data-end_ts="68.685" title="68.465" id=c_"68.465">__Dar__</span>, I wanna really appreciate being a part of this series. Some of my favorite nerd heroes our on this podcast series. So glad to join the, the Crowd. <span style="color:red" data-ts="78.435" data-end_ts="78.725" title="78.435" id=c_"78.435">__Well__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's, that's cool. Believe me. I feel so, I feel so lucky, and so, blessed to be able to talk to my nerd heroes too. It's really something. So, why don't we start off by having you talk a little bit about what it is you do. What are your artistic, what are your artistic endeavors look like? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>Well, I guess that just depends on the season, of course. You know, the wintertime is, is a lot of, you know, spending indoors working on video and, <span style="color:red" data-ts="109.345" data-end_ts="109.565" title="109.345" id=c_"109.345">__and__</span> audio projects when it's too cold to exist outside here in Denver, the summertime, you know, typically I, I don't do as much. I'm, I'm outside <span style="color:red" data-ts="119.065" data-end_ts="119.485" title="119.065" id=c_"119.065">__trying__</span>, kind of taking a break from the production, but I also work full-time as an audio director at a video game studio here called Dire Wolf. And, that's, you know, a lot of sound effects, creation, music composition, delegation of, you know, what music goes where, what sound effects go, where, how many variations to create. We're making games in the mobile space as well. So that means we have to be very conscientious of download sizes and things, which, you know, adds a bit of extra layer of complexity to the process. So, and also working here in Denver with a crew, we're, called Sila. And we've been putting on shows for about a year now, trying to bring more ambient and experimental music and, video to the city. So that in a nutshell is basically what I'm up to you these days. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's really cool. I wish that when I was in the Denver area, we would've <span style="color:red" data-ts="174.245" data-end_ts="174.405" title="174.245" id=c_"174.245">__got__</span> to hang out a little bit more. I'm gonna kind of, nail you though on a couple of things. I mean, you talk kind of a little bit about, you know, you do some music projects. I went to your site and I saw a whole bunch of releases, and then I scrolled and there were a bunch more, and I kept on scrolling and I kept on scrolling and I counted like, on the order of 72 releases that you've done over the years, which blows the top of my head off. And I think it's important to recognize that you're, when you talk about doing little audio and video projects, that there's some, there are things that are, I mean, this is an extensive body of work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>It's true. I think I, I could start by saying, well, I, I definitely had, you know, a DT as a child and somehow learned to reign that in along the way, <laugh>. But I, I think that I have definitely found a certain meditative, I guess, joy in exploring sounds and creating different sounds with, with different software. I, I like to think of myself as kind of a sonic splunker. I mean, I, I think I spend maybe half the time, exploring new plugins or gear and the combinations of the two and recording those, as well as spending a lot of time trying to find ways to kind of collage them together, you know, in, in terms of making songs. But yeah, it's, it's been this thing where I, you know, I get really antsy if I'm not putting my brain onto something. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>And ever since a very young age, I've felt that sound. I, I guess it just tickled some part of my brain in a particular way, much more intensely than, other, other things. I was the kind of kid that was always getting into trouble, always giving my parents a really hard time. So I, I think I just had always so much energy, you know, and also was, you know, the, the 6-year-old down in the basement at six in the morning playing with the nuts and bolts and tearing things apart and trying to build things. So I, I guess trying to create like sculptures and of, of some kind is, has always been an interesting thing for my brain to try to try to do. So. And, and I also spend a lot of time, I guess as a teenager, putting together music compilations, doing the whole recording off the radio and recording from one tape to the next. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>I spent a lot of time organizing songs together. And, and I think that's one of the things that's really helped me as far as putting albums together because I'll, I'll have folders full of endless amounts of songs or half finished songs. And, and one of the things I really love doing is, is, you know, putting those all together on a timeline and rearranging 'em, and sometimes chopping bits out because this one song was way too long when I created it, you know, five years ago or whatever. And, and also, you know, a big part of that process has been <span style="color:red" data-ts="343.865" data-end_ts="344.085" title="343.865" id=c_"343.865">__not__</span>, not touching things for a long period of time, which helps me go back to them and, and figure out ways to improve them or, or 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Just hear them with new ears. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>Yeah. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's interesting you kind of self-identify as, or maybe you were actually diagnosed, I don't know, but self-identifying as a DD because, I was talking to a therapist recently who, who kind of described, how people who have, a DD <span style="color:red" data-ts="370.965" data-end_ts="371.205" title="370.965" id=c_"370.965">__like__</span> a DD type brain activity oftentimes become really super engaged in things. You know, we tend to think of it as, you know, kind of the common idea of what it is, is that it's like, oh, just, scatterbrained or a little crazy or whatever, but that it often really exhibits itself as being like intensely driven and intensely engaged in certain things. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I, well, it's been said or I've read that we are all just a little bit autistic <laugh>, right? And, I might be a little bit autistic actually. Who knows? Definitely somewhat savant. I, I suppose my, my creative abilities are far out exceed my social abilities for the most part. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> Well, yeah. Okay. If that's the way that it gets identified, then I think everybody I know <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b><laugh>. Okay, good. Thanks for the affirmation. Everything's gonna be okay. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I think we're all good. We, we all can help you. We can all be each other's best friends then. So one of the things, the, the reason that I originally got in touch with you for this series is, my friend Chris Sessions, mentioned that he had seen you in, I think the made <span style="color:red" data-ts="442.405" data-end_ts="442.685" title="442.405" id=c_"442.405">__life__</span> space in Boulder, talking about, generative music creation <span style="color:red" data-ts="447.725" data-end_ts="447.885" title="447.725" id=c_"447.725">__and__</span> using Ableton Live to do that kind of thing. Yes. Is that, is that a common tool set for you, or, or do you really just sort of like fly from tool to tool? Do you have a common set of a common toolbox, or do you just really like, use something new with each project? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>I have in the past four to five years created a common toolbox, if you will. A a bunch of presets. A as I started to realize that I needed to take breaks from working on songs, I, I start, but I still wanted to feel a sense of productivity. I, mm-Hmm. <affirmative> started forcing myself in this sort of, research and development r and d kind of phase where I would go and put together crazy chains of plugins or built <span style="color:red" data-ts="492.125" data-end_ts="492.325" title="492.125" id=c_"492.125">__in__</span> patches <span style="color:red" data-ts="492.745" data-end_ts="492.965" title="492.745" id=c_"492.745">__and__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="493.025" data-end_ts="493.245" title="493.025" id=c_"493.025">__and__</span> max or reactor, and just keep a whole collection of things that I could always pull from. And also creating impulse responses as well. Before that, it typically was that every album or set of songs would have a different approach, while trying to stay under, I guess a conceptual umbrella, which, which was the sort of ambient atmospheric with acoustic instruments and lots of processing kind of paradigm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>So, yeah, I, I guess I, I do spend a lot of time exploring, I guess more generative ideas lately because I, I think I was getting a little bit bored and was reading a book on, on generative music, and, and chaos theory, and was, you know, noticing that some of these midi plugins in Ableton had a lot of random properties. And, and I just started, you know, putting things together in that RD phase and started to realize that, wow, I can get, you know, even subtle, subtle amounts of randomization would make sitting there for a hundred plus hours on one song, so much more, interesting and so much less of a drudge, you know. And so I started exploring it more and more, and it actually made, sitting there and, and listening to these songs more interesting and more fun. And especially when I, when I started building these organisms, if you will, where you just have every five minutes, a crazy blip of sound would occur while there's a whole underbed of things crawling around. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>And, and it, you know, and I actually come from a background of a painting, that's what I went to a formal college for. So I, I think very visually, in terms of my music, and I, and I like to sort of think, you know, in, in terms of creating these landscapes or like a forest of sounds. So, so the generative thing in, in harnessing random features has been, it's been huge in, in creating that sort of visual world in my head that's informed the, the sounds and compositions. But yeah, the, the class on, basically the generative class that I taught was, was just a culmination of a lot of the, the really hyper nerdy stuff, in, in Ableton using only the built-in Ableton, mid effects for the class. And specifically, I did not breach into the, the max for live realm. Sure. Because I know that's just a whole universe that you could have many, many classes on. It's a 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Wormhole. Yeah, indeed. Absolutely. So what are some of the tricks that you were able to pull off using just the standard? I mean, I'm trying to think off the top of my head. What would, you know, where would generative stuff come from? And maybe I'm having trouble imagining what, what kind of things were you doing that were generative in nature 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>Not to follow? You know, kind of like the course that I <span style="color:red" data-ts="647.285" data-end_ts="647.405" title="647.285" id=c_"647.285">__was__</span>, was teaching, but basically, many feedback loops inside of Ableton. When I discovered that that was a possibility, intrinsically with the, the software, I realized, okay, so I can just play OneNote and, and using a series of the note <span style="color:red" data-ts="663.105" data-end_ts="663.525" title="663.105" id=c_"663.105">__length__</span> device or module, or whatever they call it, enable <span style="color:red" data-ts="665.945" data-end_ts="666.165" title="665.945" id=c_"665.945">__to__</span>, two of those back to back with certain settings you can stagger or delay notes. So I can, you know, play one note and have it go from one track to the next. And it, and it sort of just keeps looping. And if I put a velocity in there with like, it turned just slightly down, so like an audio feedback would Right. Sort of go down away. It <span style="color:red" data-ts="686.165" data-end_ts="686.205" title="686.165" id=c_"686.165">__makes__</span> it a lot <span style="color:red" data-ts="686.445" data-end_ts="686.645" title="686.445" id=c_"686.445">__away__</span>. Yeah. And I, so then I also created some, I guess note filters or strippers or whatever that basically, using the, the pitch module as well as the random module. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>'cause you can set the random module to, you know, take one note in and it either accepts that note or it just, it doesn't <laugh>, and then the pitch module filters only lets only this one specific note. So those two together basically create that filter. And so I can turn that probability up to whatever I want, and then just have this crazy spread of notes just flying around. And I was really fascinated, this, I just, yesterday, I think, Jason Greer, an artist in Berlin, was just featured on the Ableton site, and he has done a very similar thing and released an, an album that's completely free, more or less. And the album actually consists of tools that he's created, using only the, the built-in Ableton MIDI plugs. And of course, he has these chains that are just ridiculous with hundreds of, I mean, it's, it's absurd. I thought I was bad in terms of just hitting duplicate, you know, 10 times. No, he's really outdone me by far. But, but what I find fascinating is it's just his whole idea of release, his release being a, a free set of tools and sounds like 1800 some odd samples. I, I, I was really fascinated by, by his approach to just releases in general and, and his generative use of Ableton. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's really interesting. Now you say that you have a background, that your, your formal background was in painting. Yeah. And you know, it's interesting because having gone through some of your catalog, listening to, listening to different things, which just gorgeous, gorgeous work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>Thank you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But additionally, I was really drawn by the artwork that accompanied, the releases as well. Yeah. How much of that did you do yourself? How much of it was stuff that you collaborated or you traded with other people on or stuff like that? Or, or are you kind of like hands off of vi of visual art at this point? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>Well, I actually, well, I studied painting in, in college, but ultimately ended up getting a job right out of college as a graphic artist. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So I did do a lot of cover artwork along the way, but it really depended on the label because there were some labels that I had a tug of war with where they had a specific direction. They were trying to go to branding, I guess, if you will. Right. And I wasn't, you know, fully into it. So I was trying to steer them in other ways. And that was always hard. Some labels were very much like, oh, whatever you want to do. Or I would send them an idea and they would really love it. And other labels had photographers that they were already working with, or sometimes I was so inundated with trying to finish and master the music that I just didn't have time to do any artwork and would just be like, please, do you have any artist? Or do you have any, you know, and there have been times where the artwork was so bad, I really had to, to say something and even had one release that was, you know, more or less just didn't work out because of, I just <span style="color:red" data-ts="867.215" data-end_ts="867.565" title="867.215" id=c_"867.215">__could__</span>, you know, I I've gotten somewhat picky, in my old age, I guess, in terms of wanting the presentation overall to be the art, to reflect the ideas within the music and the sound itself. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, the other thing that you mentioned that is that you are, the audio director at a game studio, which is, I, I find that interesting because everybody, I know that's in the, the, in the game, audio business is a kind of beat down by the amount of work that it is, and sort of like the pressure level of working on it. Yeah. But b tends to be so full, you know, so fed up with audio by the end of the day that the last thing you <span style="color:red" data-ts="908.765" data-end_ts="909.005" title="908.765" id=c_"908.765">__wanna__</span> do is any music when they get home. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>How do you keep yourself fresh musically when you are, when you're working all day in a full-time job doing audio? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>That is really, really a good question. Yeah. Firstly, working in video games is not all fun and games. So definitely has, you know, it's ups and downs. And there are days where I will come home and, and I literally need to just be, you know, away from the computer, or at least the, the programs, because I am using actually Ableton in this studio here, since I was allowed to build this studio. I chose that, that software for several reasons, mainly one, because it's so much fun with Max for live in there, and there's tons of sound design potential. But back to the point, how do I keep going after I get back? Well, again, I think it comes back to this, it's either some part of my brain that really just loves the freedom of exploration of, of various chains, of sounds together. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>You know, trying to push limits, try trying to explore, you know, how can I break this plugin? You know, what happens if I, if I automate every parameter on this thing, or if I duplicate this other effect like a dozen times, you know, what's it gonna sound like? What happens if I turn the sampling rate as, you know, to 192,000 and, and see how everything breaks or sounds amazing, or, I, I just, I guess I just have this, this endless pool of ideas that I want to try to explore. So even if I can't sit down, I don't have the creative moxie at the end of the day to actually finish a song. I'll still make myself do, do some exploring. But in terms of finishing, oftentimes it's really helped to either for me to set my own deadlines, and, and having been a freelancer for so long with the web website work and the graphic arts work, before I got into video game audio, I, it really was something that I just kind of had to force myself to do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>And, and eventually just got to where it was kind of effortless to say, okay, I'm gonna finish this thing by this date, this demo for this label. And especially once a label says, oh, they want to put it out at a certain time, then I have a very specific date. And I, and I know I have to work, ahead for that, but it's not always easy. And like in the summertime, I want to go out and I want a bike. And I, you know, which I found has actually been very, very good because, you know, the last couple years, and it, you know, a bit to my chagrin, there were, I think there were five releases that occurred last year, or the, it was like some insane amount that I didn't really want to have happen all at once. But there were different labels that had been sitting on them, some of them for like five years. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>And, and all of a sudden outta nowhere, they're all saying, okay, this month, that month. And I'm like, emailing them, trying to say, oh, can we push this off? Or, but they could, you know, it was just, it had to happen just with the printers and, and things like that. So I got super, I was, I was working, you know, 12 to 16 hour days, you know, mastering most of the time mastering my own, work, which I've done mastering for the artists, but if you've ever mastered your own work, it's the most neurotic Yeah. Difficult and saying it's, I, you know, I don't recommend it. It's totally doable, you know, with, with the numbers and, and great software and stuff. But it's also very, very tough. And so, yeah, I, I definitely had to take, I mean, half this year off has been, I've been dealing with, you know, playing out live more in RD but I have not been finishing, I think so much this year. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>And I'm getting back into that where I have a, a collection of songs and I'm starting the, the process again of putting them all together on the timeline and figuring out, you know, making the notes, what needs to be finished. To me, I think the sense of completion is, is huge in terms of just feeling, you know, a sense of place on the planets, just feeling good as an artist and, and has been a little bit kind of addictive at times. But I will say five releases in one year is insane. And, I don't think <laugh>, I, I, I think for here, moving forward, it's, it's not sustainable. I'm definitely gonna try and scale back <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Throw the, throw the anchor out of the boat for a little bit. Right. I, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>I think just for sanity's sake. Yes. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, it's interesting. So I am curious, one of the things I like doing in my podcast is talking to people about their backgrounds. And I mean, you know, visual artist, musician, sound designer, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1158.265" data-end_ts="1158.685" title="1158.265" id=c_"1158.265">__master__</span>, you know, mastering engineer, recording engineer, Sonic Explorer, all these things. I Where do you come from? What, what is the background that made you into the artist that you are? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>Well, there are days where I don't feel like I'm from this planet. No. But, I think it's, yeah, the background, it's, it just sort of all happened along the way. I, I would say a lot of it has had to do with, necessity to learn things in order to, to be more, I guess to put food on the table easier. I mean, I did spend a lot of time freelancing and needed to learn a lot as a, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1192.485" data-end_ts="1192.645" title="1192.485" id=c_"1192.485">__as__</span> graphic artist. I, I was learning the whole Adobe Suite, so that's when I got into video and, you know, even learned a little bit of web programming along the way, and I I, and that the sound thing was ultimately, so in high school, I was, I was drawing and painting a whole bunch. I, I, when I started working as a graphic artist right outta college, I lost all interest in that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>For some reason. It just up and died. And so the music really took over as the source of to, you know, get, get the, the passion source, I guess, if you will. And, and so that's what I was finding myself doing, after, after getting home from website creation and, and logo designing and all that fun, boring stuff. <laugh>, you know, as far as where the energy comes from, it's, it's hard to say, I just have to be doing something, or I'll, I'll go insane <laugh>, I think. But I did spend a lot of time, I think, just just to touch on the, the background as a teenager, working with Mod Trackers, that's, I think essentially where I got into working with computers and sound. I back in the billboards Green Days, pre-internet. I remember getting this program called Mod Edit, and I remember it was like pulling teeth to get this, 'cause you had to upload so many things just to be, to get credits from these billboard screens. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>Right. Just to be <span style="color:red" data-ts="1272.765" data-end_ts="1272.805" title="1272.765" id=c_"1272.765">__able__</span> to get, to take something. And it was such a, it took me weeks to get this program. 'cause my, I, we didn't have the, the internet or whatever they called it back then. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1281.665" data-end_ts="1281.885" title="1281.665" id=c_"1281.665">__to__</span> dial up the modem, dial up bulletin boards. Yeah. <laugh> had to run over to a friend's house. It's been about, yeah, it was, it's a nightmare. But when I finally got mod Edit, and we had a 3 86 SX at the time, which is I think 32 megs of Ram. It was a, it was an amazing big loud beast <laugh>, with an eight bit sound card on it. And this mod edit worked swimmingly on this eight bit sound card. And I, I remember the theme song was like, house of the Rising Sun done with, you know, eight bit terrible samples. And, and I remember remixing that and, but I, what I found the most interesting was pitching things way, way down or kind of abusing some of, like, the arpeggiation effects. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>And, and for some reason, just those alien sounds, they just touched me in a way that made me wanna keep listening to them and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1326.905" data-end_ts="1327.125" title="1326.905" id=c_"1326.905">__get__</span>, you know, and of course the radio at the time, WRFL in Lexington was a huge influence. There were bands like Nine Inch Nails, Bjork, nitr <span style="color:red" data-ts="1336.545" data-end_ts="1336.765" title="1336.545" id=c_"1336.545">__Ebb__</span>, and all other kinds of industrial and techno artists. And I was recording these shows onto tape and listening to these, I, I swear I wish I still had some of these tapes, and making mixes. And so I got a lot of inspiration back then, from, you know, the industrial music scene, nine-ish nails really, I think did it for me in terms of inspiration. And I was trying to, IM emulate a lot of, those, those beats on this, this mod edit program. And thank God, it, I finally saved up and got a 16 pit sound <span style="color:red" data-ts="1368.825" data-end_ts="1369.045" title="1368.825" id=c_"1368.825">__car__</span>, <laugh> <laugh>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1369.605" data-end_ts="1369.805" title="1369.605" id=c_"1369.605">__the__</span> Gravis ultrasound, which is Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>Should be in a museum at this point. Right. And, and it could have plugged my guitar into the, the, the computer. You know, I, I did take a, a bit of piano, I guess, lessons and really wasn't super into that. But when I heard Nirvana, I decided I have to, I have to be in a rock and roll band. I, I really have to be a desperate, you know, depressed rock and roller <laugh>. So I, you know, got this terribly crappy electric guitar and would just spend hours trying to become good at power chords. I mean, I remember my fingers just hurting so bad. And, but what I think made it all super fun and, and Dearing or durable was being able to plug the guitar into the computer and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1412.585" data-end_ts="1413.005" title="1412.585" id=c_"1412.585">__record__</span> sounds and put them into, I think I was working with Scream Tracker this time because I was really big into, the, the demo scene and downloading these amazing demos from Finland, like the Future Crew. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>And they just, just blew my mind with the graphics and the animation. And, you know, I think I was watching a lot of films at the time, too, which is making me very interested in, in putting Vision two with Sound Together. Right. So, yeah, I think like that formative time for me was, and you know, and pissed my parents off so many times. They'd come at three in the morning <laugh>, and I'm, and they're like, what are you doing? And I'm like, making music on the computer. They didn't get it right. But it was always a point of contention. But now they're like, I we're glad that you did that, and, you know, you were kind of rebellious and, you know, 'cause now I'm, I'm, you know, having a great time doing it here at, at Dyer Wolf. Indeed. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, one of the things that I know, I, I know a number of people who started off in, with Trackers. Yeah. And to a certain extent that working mechanism gets in your blood a little bit. Right. And some people never really can shake. They, they always look back at that as being maybe some of the most creative times of their lives, or some of 'em. And some of 'em look at it as like, you know, maybe the way I do about like, reel <span style="color:red" data-ts="1489.485" data-end_ts="1489.645" title="1489.485" id=c_"1489.485">__to__</span> reel tape, you know, I'm glad I never have to like, wrap a reel <span style="color:red" data-ts="1493.085" data-end_ts="1493.165" title="1493.085" id=c_"1493.085">__to__</span> reel tape around a spindle again. Yeah. <laugh>. You know, it's just, it's just one of those personal things. I did it so many times, I never wanna see it again. <laugh>, where, what's your feeling now about, do you ever kind of wish you could get back into like, the modern trackers? Like, what's that one? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>Is it Sandbox, maybe? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>No, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1511.485" data-end_ts="1511.565" title="1511.485" id=c_"1511.485">__and__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>Buzz or maybe Reno. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, Reno is the one I'm thinking of. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>And the, and the reason why I mention all these is 'cause yes, I still have them and I still <laugh>, I still use them. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Yeah. They seem to be on the tip of your tongue, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>Yeah. And actually I've been using Sun <span style="color:red" data-ts="1526.205" data-end_ts="1526.685" title="1526.205" id=c_"1526.205">__VA__</span> whole lot. It's basically free for PC and OSX and I think it's like five bucks for, iOS. And you can do some really fascinating stuff in there. And Admittingly, I don't use the actual traditional tracker portion of Sandbox. What I typically do with it is because it's like Max or Reactor, it has that module connect the dots sort of based system. And, and there are some feedback loop modules. And I, I just love abusing the heck outta this program and creating some really nasty sounds. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1556.225" data-end_ts="1556.445" title="1556.225" id=c_"1556.225">__Oh__</span>, sure. Some, some noise makers essentially, you just open the thing up and it starts growling at you and <laugh>, you know, intimidating you. So that's, that's kind of what I'd like to do. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So how did you make the transition from trackers to like more traditional software? Because again, some of the people I know just, I mean, they kinda struggle with more linear working systems or, or, you know, maybe Ableton is a little closer in some modest way, but even that tends to be a lot more linear and a lot less tweaky than what you have to deal with in a Mod Tracker world. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>Yeah, I think, well, I was working with Buzz, ultimately 'cause I, I didn't touch after the teenage stint, with industrial experimentation on, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1600.305" data-end_ts="1600.525" title="1600.305" id=c_"1600.305">__at__</span> three six <inaudible>, I, I went off to college, started study painting. And then I, I, when I got back and started doing the graphic arts thing and lost all interest, had no more passion, I got into Buzz. And that really was so much fun, because again, it's like Sun <span style="color:red" data-ts="1613.005" data-end_ts="1613.205" title="1613.005" id=c_"1613.005">__Box__</span> in that you, you know, you have all these modules, you can connect them, wire them, you know, chain them in whatever bizarre ways you need to, to, get whatever, you know, demons out. . <affirmative>. But I, so yeah. And at that point, I, I was working on an album with that, but I was like really struggling to make a sound that I suppose I was still trying to figure out what was my sound. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>You know, I was listening to a lot of Apex when a lot of, different types of electronic music and, and techno and, you know, going to raves at the time. And, really just soaking it all in. But I, I think that was such a, an archaic thing that as far as Buzz is concerned, it was an archaic type of process to me. And I was watching other guys use things like FL Studio or cubase, then I finally made the switch, and I think for the better, it actually helped open up, you know, new worlds of ideas in terms of just basically solidifying a style. Because I, and I could have kept going with Buzz, I'm sure, but <span style="color:red" data-ts="1669.205" data-end_ts="1669.405" title="1669.205" id=c_"1669.205">__El__</span> also was very buggy and was really hard to, you know, sometimes songs just wouldn't open up after while, while it was really, really frustrating. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>So I think just moving to a more stable environment and also a, a UI that, that looked more interesting. And with FL Studio, it just was, you could make things happen faster. And I think that that sense of immediacy, that that quickness really helped me feel more affirmed with every session, every night I could come away thinking like, oh, I actually got a lot more done. It feels really good this way. And the same with Cubase. I, I started being able to, like, create songs faster just because of the, the workflow in there is, is a lot more. It's just a paradigm that's, you know, been, perfected for such a long time, I think. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Now it sounds like this, this whole range of time has been really sort of software and computer oriented. Yeah. Have you ever spent much time with hardware, or was computer kind of always the thing for you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>Well, it was definitely the thing for me for the longest time, and I've been branching out into working with synthesizers mainly, it's been a lot of acoustic instruments. Like I have a piano in my house and a, vibraphone and I like to <span style="color:red" data-ts="1743.185" data-end_ts="1743.405" title="1743.185" id=c_"1743.185">__mic__</span> do a lot of things with mics and fielder recordings as well. It's for the longest time been the marriage of acoustic and DSP processing, but I got a, a realistic MG one some time ago. And I, I love this thing. It is, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's such a beautiful sounding instrument. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>Yeah. And it has that saw wave polyphony and literally every single key, I don't know how they built this thing because it's a hundred percent analog and it, you can literally just play massive chords with 10 fingers in, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1772.445" data-end_ts="1772.645" title="1772.445" id=c_"1772.445">__in__</span> a couple toes if need be. I mean, it really is. I've literally laid my arm down on the entire keyboard, and it's just the most gorgeous spectral sounding, you know, monster. I, but of course, it was delivered to me in, in this gorgeous old suitcase. And they, it's, it was like they just threw it off the bus and landed in front of my house. I mean, this thing was in some sad shape, and it, so I got it for free, which is great, but it has, and the, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1798.325" data-end_ts="1798.485" title="1798.325" id=c_"1798.325">__and__</span> the MG one especially had that foam that kind of melted. Oh, right. Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1801.925" data-end_ts="1802.085" title="1801.925" id=c_"1801.925">__On__</span>, and I cleaned it up a little bit, but some things just don't work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>Right. Especially if the weather is funny. It actually behaves bizarrely, but the sounds that come out of it when it behaves like brokenly it are really amazing and gorgeous. So I will never get rid of that ever. And I, I am the type of guy that wants to be very specific in what I buy. I don't wanna just go out and buy a ton of gear. I've had friends that went down the, the rabbit hole of, you know, purchasing tons of things, spending tons of money and only selling them all back for half. And so I, I mate for life with my synthesizer <laugh>, if you will. And I just got a, a core mini log, the new one, because I was getting fed up with my MG one, and it's similar to the MG one, like on steroids. Right. And I built a couple things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>I built a weird sound generator and, the kit, the, the thing <span style="color:red" data-ts="1852.405" data-end_ts="1852.525" title="1852.405" id=c_"1852.405">__of__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1852.525" data-end_ts="1852.645" title="1852.525" id=c_"1852.525">__a__</span> LEAP kit. Oh, yeah. And so I, I, I do enjoy sometimes, you know, picking up the soldering iron. I'm actually looking right now at the field kit by coma, and which is I wanted to get into modular because I know that's all the rage. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But I, I don't necessarily wanna have the atypical modular Synthes sound because I can, I can do the that with in the computer and more, even though, of course, it's, it's not very pretty on stage. But I usually will just hide that and have controllers anyway. But the, the field kit to me seems like a really interesting branch in, into the modular world for me, just because you can have microphones and contact mics and it's, it's got a lot of interesting, like little motors that it comes with it. You can place on objects and it vibrates them. And so I, I am slowly getting away from the computer into more synthesizers, but, but again, I'm super picky and, you know, by the time I'm dead, I'll probably have this room full of them. But it's gonna take me a while <laugh> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1906.785" data-end_ts="1907.005" title="1906.785" id=c_"1906.785">__or__</span> I might be dead because I'm in a room full of synthesizers and never go out again. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, but maybe the nice thing is, is that when you're, when you're dead, you'll still be in going through your first pass of synthesizers as opposed to someone like me who synthesizers come and go in waves. And it's not always, it's not always great because like you talk about even with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1927.605" data-end_ts="1927.765" title="1927.605" id=c_"1927.605">__an__</span> MG one, you know, as sort of decays, right, right. In your hands, you're there, you know, you know it so well. But also you're kind of there to both nurse it along, but also sort of like, take advantage of its decrepitude, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>Right? Yeah. Yeah. I think every instrument in my house has some kind of handicap <laugh>, somehow I've collected, I've just like, yeah, I'm a kind of like a, a school for the gifted instrument, you know, if you <laugh>. And to me, that, that makes them interesting, you know, and, and of course people come in and they look and they're just like, ah, you know, is everything okay in here? You 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Know, you wanna go to my house, <laugh>? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>I have a guitar that actually has all the strings. If you No, no, my guitars actually do have all their strings, even though they're about 20 years old. I think they sound amazing though, with all that grit and dirt in there's texture, you know, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, that's funny. So, let's talk a little bit about the game design work that you do, because the way you explained it to me via email is that you kind of work on both the music side as well as the sound design, sort of like just the, the in-game sound stuff. Is that true? Or, or, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>Yeah. Although we service several companies here. We're basically a studio that works with Pokemon and, Bethesda. We do one of their Elder Scrolls games. So, Pokemon has actually sent us some music that, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2010.345" data-end_ts="2010.565" title="2010.345" id=c_"2010.345">__but__</span>, third party composer, the games we make in-house, I compose all the music for using various contact orchestral sample libraries and Ableton just massive, behemoths of midi notes and CC data <laugh>, the usual sort of mockup midi mockup, is how I approach the music. Yeah. And in the SFX, of course, I'm, I'm building as well inside of Ableton. I, I just, it's been the most stable program that I've used at the previous studio. Used Logic and then, pro Tools before that. And it was always having problems when you would have a project with, you know, sometimes some scenes of the game. You really, you have to have hunt. There <span style="color:red" data-ts="2048.405" data-end_ts="2048.485" title="2048.405" id=c_"2048.405">__are__</span> hundreds of sounds and it just gets unwieldy. Or trying to go back and track down a sound that needs to be fixed. With Ableton, I can have massive amounts of sound effects composed inside of one project, and it doesn't blink an eye as far as getting things done quickly and me not going insane. That's been huge. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>How often do you find yourself tapping in to like, like some of the oddity knowledge that you've pulled together, whether, whether it's like making reactor patches or max patches or, you know, pulling field recordings you did at one point. Do you, do you find yourself tapping that for the game work a lot? Or does that tend to really live in the contact sound library world 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>For vocal processing? I've actually been able to use Max for live and Reactor quite a bit. There's some really interesting pitch shifting, patches for Max for live, where you can just create a chord out of whatever you sin through it. And so for the Demon sounds, obviously, it's been perfect. That's your classic. I'm actually five dudes all in one person kind of demon. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2117.785" data-end_ts="2118.005" title="2117.785" id=c_"2117.785">__You__</span> know, we, we all we've come to know and love over the years, yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I am Legion, right? Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>Many. And so that, that <span style="color:red" data-ts="2124.125" data-end_ts="2124.445" title="2124.125" id=c_"2124.125">__patch__</span> is like the, should be called the Legion Patch. It's perfect, but unfortunately not a lot, is not as much as I would like. I'd really love to do a, a sci-fi game, and therefore I would be able to use so many of these, these crazy new block-based, reactor patches that are coming out. Right. Which they sound amazing now. And, and I'd love to use them more, but we're basically making a type of fantasy, fantasy type games. So it, it is a lot of Foley sounds not that I'm, I'm taking, we usually have to pull libraries, or by DVDs <span style="color:red" data-ts="2155.225" data-end_ts="2155.445" title="2155.225" id=c_"2155.225">__as__</span> we just, I don't have the time to do fully. I have done some fully, there's actually a sound in our restroom here, actually, when you flush the, the urinal, it made this loud, you know, sound and <laugh>, and I actually sampled that and it, and it worked as part of this horn. I pitched it way down, and it worked perfectly as this, this <span style="color:red" data-ts="2172.755" data-end_ts="2173.045" title="2172.755" id=c_"2172.755">__show__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2173.145" data-end_ts="2173.365" title="2173.145" id=c_"2173.145">__far__</span> kind of horn sound when, when you, this one character comes out. It's, so, I, you know, that's one of those little hidden gems, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2180.795" data-end_ts="2181.085" title="2180.795" id=c_"2180.795">__that__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2181.405" data-end_ts="2181.525" title="2181.405" id=c_"2181.405">__I__</span> just, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, if nothing else, every time you hear that, you'll always think of a urinal, right? Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>I tell everyone in the office, so they can't escape that thought. It's like, yep. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2189.985" data-end_ts="2190.205" title="2189.985" id=c_"2189.985">__Our__</span> urinals in the game. But it sounds amazing. It doesn't really sound like a urinal. So <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. So I'm, I wanna ask you a little bit about something. So you talk about really having been a self learner and maybe kind of an obsessive self learner. Yeah. Which is, I can really relate to that a lot. I, I've always felt that myself as well. And I, and I think that it, you know, for myself, I think it gave me some advantages and some disadvantages. Yeah. I would like to hear your perspectives on that. Having been, having been self-taught, what do you, where do you think that that gives you a leg up on people that might have had a more formal education? And where do you think that it might actually hamper you or, or may have slowed you down in the past? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>Gotcha. Well, I, I would say the benefits, obviously are, you know, that I have a, a perspective that is, has not been, I don't wanna say tainted, let's just use the word shaped by, I guess, somebody else's overarching opinion, or therefore, like a professor or whatever. And I, and I loved my professors in college and painting and, you know, did everything that they said to the t. But I, I, I feel like the freedom that I could gain of freedom of thought in teaching myself things was a huge benefit. Building up my own portfolio from that I, I think was, was really huge. But it was always a problem, you know, not, you know, basically having, I guess, formal training in, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2280.585" data-end_ts="2280.805" title="2280.585" id=c_"2280.585">__in__</span> Sound. In the past it had been a problem, but, you know, luckily I think in the way the video game and maybe many industries work, word of mouth was that's how I was able to get a foot in the door ultimately. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, and was told in the beginning, oh, we're only gonna need your help temporarily for a couple months in which thankfully turned into a couple years working with Lego, on one of their games. And, as far as the, the hindrances, I would say, well, I guess I just, I just named one, another one, may, may have been, at least for me in particular, have been sort of like the <laugh>, some of the antisocial tendencies that, that have occurred, you know, where I would spend a lot more time <span style="color:red" data-ts="2318.945" data-end_ts="2319.165" title="2318.945" id=c_"2318.945">__in__</span>, in the office basically researching things and, and figuring out how to perfect my processes to make my job go a little bit easier and smoother and, and better, versus just hanging out all the time. You know, and especially in the video game industry, there's a sort of, I guess, tradition of everyone just sort of shooting each other with Nerf mm-Hmm. <affirmative> guns more and, you know, goofing off a bit. And so I, I, I think I, over the years, have spent more time sort of focusing in, ultimately I think because it made me feel good, it made me feel, gave me a sense of purpose 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>In addition to doing recordings and doing this work. You're also a pretty active performer, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>Yeah. More, more so lately than, than, well, it just comes and goes in phases. Yeah. But, but recently, this past year has been pretty good for shows. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Have you done, have you done much overseas or has it been mostly in the us? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>I would say it's been a bit of both. And I think the, the US shows have a lot of it has happened mainly out of, just because I, you know, it's easier and, and I've known people here. And so I ultimately, I haven't played a, a bunch of shows over my career. I think I've, because I've been spending most of my time in the studio, in the 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Lab Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>In experimenting and trying to sort of unleash my creatures on the planet, versus getting out there and really doing the whole hyper networking thing. And which, you know, I think a lot of artists may be better at than me. And you know, I guess I feel very, very fortunate in, in that some of the labels that I've worked with have had the, I guess that the wherewithal or whatever to put some shows together overseas for me. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2412.235" data-end_ts="2412.525" title="2412.235" id=c_"2412.235">__Well__</span>, I just got back from Poland and Latvia, I was able to play a show over there and, you know, that was through some, some roundabout through some mastering work that I'd done for a guy we both released on the same label as well. And you know, so it's kind of random sometimes when I do get shows overseas, I was able to play a show in Montreal earlier this year, and a bunch of shows in, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2434.985" data-end_ts="2435.205" title="2434.985" id=c_"2434.985">__in__</span> Denver with the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2436.165" data-end_ts="2436.325" title="2436.165" id=c_"2436.165">__Sila__</span> group that, that I've been working with. But the first shows overseas were actually, and it's, I don't think this is a normal case where actually set up through a net label, which I'm sure you're familiar with the net label thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. But normally those are solo budget that they don't Yeah. Really provide anything. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>Exactly. Which is why I, and to this day, I'm like, how did they pull that off <laugh>, honestly? I mean, was there a trust fund of all? I really don't know. Honestly, I'm not questioning it. It was an amazing experience and I feel super thankful. That was back when I was experimenting more in dance music and techno, which, you know, obviously versus ambient experimental gets artists way more shows. But, you know, was able to go and play a show in Amsterdam and Berlin and, and various other places. So to me, I like to think, it's more about quality versus qua. It's quantity. And I also have a, a weird want to have each show be somewhat different. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So I, I kind of plan things differently for each event and try to, to gear some of the performance to the space. Like one of the shows in Dortmund, was inside of this oddball venue. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>It, so I, I think it's Dortmund if I'm correct, where their train runs above ground and we are in this station that essentially was below the track, and I set the microphone outside and I was just going to try to pick up field sounds. I, and it, all of a sudden when I started playing this train goes by, I had no idea that was gonna happen. So that was a really wonderful happy accident that, that, you know, and everybody in the crowd was like, oh my gosh, did you plan that? Of course. I'm like, no, I think I just, I got lucky. Like, everything like these shows, I just got lucky in some ways. So yeah, I, I'd say about half and half overseas and half here in the States. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's interesting. I, I was just curious because the, the music fears that I heard, I mean, it has, it actually, to me it has a lot of alignment with like, some of the kind of things you hear, especially out of like Northern Europe and stuff, kind of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2550.885" data-end_ts="2551.005" title="2550.885" id=c_"2550.885">__a__</span>, you know, very still, but, but also somehow like really tied to nature. Yeah. And, you know, it sounds like that's something that actually is very specifically something that you kind of consider part of your voice. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>Yeah, I think, I think I might be a closet pantheist in some way, but this, this sort of idea is how I kind of express, you know, through the music, trying to reflect things that I've seen in nature and, and feelings that I've gotten just walking through, through the mountains in Kentucky where I grew up, it was especially influential. The hills there are just rife with life, most of the time. So green, that place, at least compared to here in Colorado. And there's the Appalachian range. I, you know, if, if I could get a little esoteric, I might think there's a bit of vibration occurring, you know, on a sort of sub-level under the earth, as that is a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2596.245" data-end_ts="2596.405" title="2596.245" id=c_"2596.245">__very__</span>, was at one point a super active range. I mean, if it ever were to go off it destroy the, this side of the world. So yeah, I do feel like I, I want to try and pull from nature as much as I can, as, as an inspiration. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Unfortunately, we're kind of running out of time, which is, I, I have so many other things I'd love to talk to you about, you know, particularly about your ability to pull off as many releases as you do and all that stuff. But one of the things that is really important for me to know is where are you headed? You talk about kind of like slowing down your release process a little bit, but it also sounds like you're still very much a person who wants to be out exploring, exploring the edges of sound and the edges <span style="color:red" data-ts="2641.525" data-end_ts="2641.645" title="2641.525" id=c_"2641.525">__of__</span> the technology and stuff like that. What are the things that are kind of in your bonnet right now and and where do you see that taking you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>That's a tough, tough question. <laugh>. So, so, so many things, so many places. There's a million ideas that I have that would, would love to, to execute before I go back into outer space from once I came, I guess. But I think immediately I'm definitely wanting to get back into building things, pick up that solder iron and inhale those amazing carcinogenic fumes that I love <laugh>, you know, and build a field kit. Probably go down the, the modular road like everybody else. But I, I do find it, there's something sort of beautiful and, and, tactile about, you know, touching those knobs and, and connecting things. But I, I wanna start with the field kit. And I think to me that's, you know, I've been a, a plug <span style="color:red" data-ts="2688.885" data-end_ts="2689.045" title="2688.885" id=c_"2688.885">__in__</span> junkie for so long, but the, the, the modular world is so vast, and so it's all new to me. And, and also I'd like to, get back into filming again and working on more videos, getting back out into nature and, and shooting footage and, and, and making soundtracks to those films. I think that, that to me would be the ultimate goal. But beyond that, I have absolutely no idea. <laugh>, it's a mystery, as is life. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I hear you man. I want to thank you so much for taking the time. This has been a fabulous discussion and you've got me kind of inspired. I'm, I'm anxious to, to get, get back to my gear and, and make some music. 'cause I, I love when, when these discussions take me there. That's really great. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>Awesome. Thank you for having 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, it was, it was great. And I, and I look forward to the next time we get a chance to meet. It'll be i'll, I'll make sure that I'm paying more attention. <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>No problem. Absolutely. Yeah. Alright, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well have a good evening. Thanks so much. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2745.545" data-end_ts="2745.765" title="2745.545" id=c_"2745.545">__Bye__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jason: </b>Take care, Darwin. 
</p>
