<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, this morning I have the great pleasure of introducing you to Bert <span style="color:red" data-ts="10.07" data-end_ts="10.36" title="10.07" id=c_"10.07">__Shia__</span>, I'm gonna mess this up. <span style="color:red" data-ts="12.11" data-end_ts="12.4" title="12.11" id=c_"12.11">__Shia__</span> Teta, who is the main person behind Percuss <span style="color:red" data-ts="16.2" data-end_ts="16.32" title="16.2" id=c_"16.2">__a__</span>, the company that does the Percuss <span style="color:red" data-ts="18.52" data-end_ts="18.64" title="18.52" id=c_"18.52">__a__</span> audio cubes. Now, I get introduced to these, first of all, by Bird himself, at a NAMM show at one point where he was showing some, early versions of this. We had talked about Max M s P programming back then. I was reintroduced to them by my friend Mark Mosser, who has become a bit of a savant with <span style="color:red" data-ts="39.38" data-end_ts="39.6" title="39.38" id=c_"39.38">__the__</span>, audio cubes and ha and has worked it into his performance practice in a very deep way. So I <span style="color:red" data-ts="49.03" data-end_ts="49.32" title="49.03" id=c_"49.03">__seem__</span> to just keep on running to, into audio cubes everywhere I turn. And, I was really excited to get a chance to talk to Bert. So, good morning, Bert. How are you? I'm 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert Schiettecatte: </b>Good. How are you, Dorian? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm okay. So you're in Belgium, so actually it's not morning for you. It's sometime in the afternoon, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>Yeah, it's 5:30 PM here. <span style="color:red" data-ts="68.14" data-end_ts="68.36" title="68.14" id=c_"68.14">__Oh__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>All right. Well, so good afternoon to you, <laugh>. So, I gave a brief introduction there, a little bit about what, what you do. Why don't you fill in the blanks, explain a little bit maybe what the audio cubes are for people that aren't, that aren't aware, and also maybe talk about what kind of development you do with them. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>Okay. So, the other cubes are basically, an instrument, a combination of hardware and software, where the hardware consists of a network of smart wireless devices. In, in, in our case, it's, a network of cubes. And each cube is basically a self-contained little computer that, that we designed that, that senses other cubes nearby, including their distance orientation, as well as distance to other objects like your hand and so on. You could <span style="color:red" data-ts="127.08" data-end_ts="127.32" title="127.08" id=c_"127.08">__trace__</span> sound <span style="color:red" data-ts="127.64" data-end_ts="127.88" title="127.64" id=c_"127.64">__with__</span> those cubes, or you could control effects by, by moving your hands closer and further away from the cubes since the cubes also detect each other and detect each other's distance. You can also move cubes, closer and further away from each other, and you can link that information to, effect parameters or, you know, instrument parameters. Like, you know, every cube could be linked to a module, like a software module that exists in your computer that is maybe an oscillator or a filter or something else. So in a sense, you could think of the cubes as, like a wireless audiovisual modeler, synthesizer in a way where the, the sound generation part runs runs on your computer. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So a couple of things to make clear, the audio cubes themselves don't make audio. They're really controllers for the computer-based system, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>That's correct. Although the other cubes do, do, do single processing, but they don't process audio or don't generate audio. They 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Actually I see, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>I see. They generate optical signals and they interpret optical signals, which are send between all the cubes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Got it. Understood. The other thing is how do they communicate between themselves and the computer? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>So it used to be that we, when we released the auto cubes, all of that happened through the infrared communication network that, that the auto cubes use between each other. We were using the infrared communication ports that each <span style="color:red" data-ts="209" data-end_ts="209.2" title="209" id=c_"209">__auto__</span> cube has, and each <span style="color:red" data-ts="210.2" data-end_ts="210.36" title="210.2" id=c_"210.2">__other__</span> cube has four of these inputs and outputs. We were using those to sense the environment and to sense other cubes, but we <span style="color:red" data-ts="217.92" data-end_ts="217.96" title="217.92" id=c_"217.92">__are__</span> using those at the same time for transmitting data. Okay. So, so the cubes were forming <span style="color:red" data-ts="223.8" data-end_ts="223.92" title="223.8" id=c_"223.8">__a__</span>, a network using the, using those communication parts, and they were like forwarding packets between the cubes. And so there was like a packet routing thing that we developed, and that basically made the data end up with the cube that was connected through U S B to your computer, so the data would like hop over the cubes to your computer. Essentially. That worked fine in the beginning, but then we realized that the limitations of that and that we, we wanted to make it way better, and that's, that's when I started working on a wireless upgrade for the cubes, which is a little module that goes into each cube, and that basically creates a star network. So the, so then you have a direct communication path from every wireless cube to the central cube, which is, you know, connected to your computer through U S B and which collects all the data. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So one of the cubes is sort of like the master, and that's U S B connected and everything else, ro roams free wireless. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>Exactly. Got 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It, got it. Interesting. That sounds like some pretty amazing technology. Did you develop all these network topologies and stuff yourself? Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>I had to because when we looked at various wireless options for the cubes, we looked at wifi, but wifi was really power hungry, and we didn't want this experience like you have with a, with a router that you buy where you have to figure out how to set it up and how to, you know, how to make it, make all the devices, get an IP address and all that kind of stuff. Right. And so I didn't like wifi too much because of that. And then I looked at Bluetooth, and then Bluetooth seemed to be this thing that was developed by, by people in a, in a meeting room who had no idea about the music industry or what people, people in the music industry really wanted, or what was important to them. So it was like this thing that was developed for sending pictures of your, of your pets, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>You know, your iPhone to somebody else's iPhone or whatever. But, and then later on, of course, you know, now with Bluetooth with a new Bluetooth standards, they're trying to sort of get away from that and they, they also kind of try to do new things with it, but <span style="color:red" data-ts="349.72" data-end_ts="349.84" title="349.72" id=c_"349.72">__I__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="349.84" data-end_ts="350.04" title="349.84" id=c_"349.84">__but__</span> I think they're like super late with that. So when I looked at it, Bluetooth was, was like in its very early stages, and it was just not what we wanted. And also Bluetooth was limited to like five or six slave devices. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, I was gonna say, I didn't think that you could come up with near the <span style="color:red" data-ts="367.3" data-end_ts="367.52" title="367.3" id=c_"367.3">__top__</span> topology that a complex audio cube system would require. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>No. So <span style="color:red" data-ts="373.56" data-end_ts="373.68" title="373.56" id=c_"373.56">__that__</span>, so we, I wanted to be able to have a, a one point <span style="color:red" data-ts="377.16" data-end_ts="377.64" title="377.16" id=c_"377.16">__15__</span> network mm-hmm. <affirmative>, so one central cube and 15 wireless cubes. Right. And I wanted it to, to work in real time <span style="color:red" data-ts="385.02" data-end_ts="385.24" title="385.02" id=c_"385.02">__and__</span> with relatively low latency. And I want it to be sort of like, if something would drop off like you, it wouldn't be a disaster, and it wouldn't cause any other problems in the network. So basically we had all these, these ideas and these, these requirements that were just not possible to, to satisfy with something off the shelf like Bluetooth. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That makes sense. So, Bert, I've gotta ask a question. One of the things I like doing in my podcast is I like talking to people about how they became the artist or technologist that they've become. In your case, it seems like there's some, some kind of real interesting map there because, you know, it's clear that you're not only a musician, but you care very deeply about instrument design, but you also have, strong enough engineering chops to be able to develop kind of your own network stack. What is your background? How did you get to the point of being able to do all those things simultaneously and how do you maintain a high, high level of knowledge in all of those areas? I know that's like a million questions, but I'm just really curious about how you got to be who you are. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>Maybe I'll, I'll go back in time a bit and explain a bit about, how I ended up in music technology and then then, you know, feel free to pull me off on a tangent when when it gets in gets interesting. Okay. So when I grew up, I went to, to music school. Like we have classical music education here in Belgium. <span style="color:red" data-ts="477.11" data-end_ts="477.4" title="477.11" id=c_"477.11">__That__</span> was like, the only thing I could get into was classical music education. That was the only thing we had in school. And there was <span style="color:red" data-ts="482.68" data-end_ts="482.88" title="482.68" id=c_"482.68">__no__</span>, no jazz school or anything close by. I, I just, I just did that, went to classical music education. It was a horrible, horrible experience because <laugh>, I mean, in, in Belgium, at least at that time, <span style="color:red" data-ts="493.82" data-end_ts="494.04" title="493.82" id=c_"493.82">__the__</span>, like, you take <span style="color:red" data-ts="494.78" data-end_ts="495" title="494.78" id=c_"494.78">__the__</span> classical music education and they, they make you take theory for two years and then you can pick an instrument. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>You know, you, you, you can go play the instrument, but basically that involves practicing scores in front of a piano one hand at a time, like 15 minutes a week, something like that. Right. And so it was not a very enjoyable experience. And, you know, my, my parents put me there because it was like the only, the only thing that they could imagine that I could, could do in music, it was like, let's put it in music school or something like that. Right. Which is understandable. But today, if I had kids, I would, I would take a different direction. I would put them in jazz school or something like that. But sure. We didn't, we didn't have that at that time. So anyway, so I was in high school, I was doing that, I was, I was kind of fed up with it. And, then I then, you know, I had an interest in electronic music, because of, you know, classmates, listening to electronic music. And I had, discovered, biosphere, I don't know if, if you know that artist. Yep. So I was, I was into AM music and electronic music, and I, you know, I had heard some, some music of Jean-Michel Jar and all that. Right. And, and you know, all the other kids in class were playing guitar and all that, and I didn't want to be like them. So <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>So I asked around and I ended up, I, I, I realized I needed synthesizers and samplers and, you know, mixers and that sort of thing. Right. So, and that obviously it cost a lot of money. 'cause that was, you know, that was like, like a, at the time when, when a, when a basic sampler, you know, would cost like, you know, $2,000 or something and it had two megabytes of memory or whatever. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>The only, the only way for me to, to get that sort of money was to get a job somewhere. <span style="color:red" data-ts="595.2" data-end_ts="595.32" title="595.2" id=c_"595.2">__I__</span>, I just turned 15 and that's when, you know, that's like the age when you can get a job. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>Like during the holidays or whatever. So, I was in a demo group. I don't know if you know about the demo scene. Like demo scene was like a big thing in Europe, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The, the computer programming demo scene. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>Yeah. Like the people who <span style="color:red" data-ts="613.24" data-end_ts="613.36" title="613.24" id=c_"613.24">__were__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="613.36" data-end_ts="613.52" title="613.36" id=c_"613.36">__on__</span>, like these, these demo, you know, demo scene groups where they would like program, you know, little demos and go to competitions and that sort of thing. Sure. And I didn't know very much about program yet, but there was a guy there who knew, who knew somebody who had a company who was looking for, for a web programmer to do like, you know, H T M L coding and you know, some pearl stuff and all that. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>And I had some, I had some really basic H T M L skills, and I had <span style="color:red" data-ts="639.24" data-end_ts="639.4" title="639.24" id=c_"639.24">__put__</span> up a website for the demo <span style="color:red" data-ts="640.53" data-end_ts="640.88" title="640.53" id=c_"640.53">__scene__</span> group. And that's how I, I got my first job as a kid. And then from there I learned <span style="color:red" data-ts="646.12" data-end_ts="646.44" title="646.12" id=c_"646.12">__product__</span> programming and, yeah, <span style="color:red" data-ts="648.72" data-end_ts="648.84" title="648.72" id=c_"648.72">__I__</span>, I worked in this company, saved up money, and then I started buying, samplers and synthesizers and, you know, and a mixer and speakers. And of course that took several years because if you add all that up, I mean, today that doesn't, that doesn't cut cost a lot of money anymore, but Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="664.31" data-end_ts="664.6" title="664.31" id=c_"664.31">__Like__</span> then it was, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It used to be crazy, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>You know, $10,000 or something like that. And of course, if you're in high school, you don't have $10,000 <laugh>. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>But <span style="color:red" data-ts="672.6" data-end_ts="672.72" title="672.6" id=c_"672.6">__I__</span>, but I did that and then, I made a record with a friend and, I was thinking about where I would take my career because I, you know, I was, I was getting close to graduation and, we had to, I had to figure out what to do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>Then I realized, well, I'm actually really interested in music technology and if I'm, you know, if I'm going to be, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="692.48" data-end_ts="692.56" title="692.48" id=c_"692.48">__it__</span> was also, you know, doing a lot of stuff with computers in general was like playing adventure games besides making music, all this kind of stuff was like a big fan of the Lucas Arts and <span style="color:red" data-ts="700.32" data-end_ts="700.56" title="700.32" id=c_"700.32">__Sierra__</span> Games. Right. And so I really wanted to go do something with computers, but I was not all that interested in like, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="707.34" data-end_ts="707.56" title="707.34" id=c_"707.34">__nor__</span> normal, you know, IT stuff or stuff like that. I didn't want to be like a server administrator or something like that, that, so the only thing for me to do was to go to computer science. And I, I, I realized, okay, if I go into computer science, I can also do stuff with music technology, you know, because then obviously I will learn how to program better and I will be able to do stuff in, in, you know, music technology. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>Sure. And I wanted to build synthesizer and drum machines and that sort of thing. I was really like blown away by, by those instruments. At that time I had a cork <span style="color:red" data-ts="734.92" data-end_ts="735.08" title="734.92" id=c_"734.92">__wave__</span> station, which was, I think the main, was like the moment when I said, this is what I want to do. So this was like the main synthesizer for me that made, you know, that, so like the cork <span style="color:red" data-ts="746.72" data-end_ts="746.92" title="746.72" id=c_"746.72">__wave__</span> station was like an example of, this is a great thing, this is what I want to build. And then I had anai sampler, and this was like, okay, this is not how to build it. <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b><laugh>, even though the machine sounded great, the way, the way to interact with it or use it was, was for me really frustrated. But that's like, because of the interface, of course, but Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>So anyway, so I went to, university for computer science. I went to, to Brussels University, which is a, has a really good computer science program. And there, every year we had to take a yearly mandatory programming like project, which is like the major part of, of your, of what, like your, your grades. Right. And so it's a mandatory thing, but again, I, I wanted to do stuff with music. So every year I would build like some music software somehow by the time I got to the third year. So it's a four year program, and which ends in a Master's, and in the third year you're supposed to do like an internship. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>And so I had built this open source editor for PIC four structured audio orchestra language. Right. Which was this like a standard that was being developed at M I T. So there was a, like a command line compiler for it. And the idea was that you could describe an instrument and then compile it, and then put it in the PEC for Bitstream. Okay. So it was like C sound, but it would go into an pec pec file essentially, but there was no editor for it. <span style="color:red" data-ts="837.02" data-end_ts="837.24" title="837.02" id=c_"837.02">__Oh__</span>. So I built an editor for it, like a graphical editor, sort of a max, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_(software)">Max/MSP</a> but very, very simple because of course, we only had like one year we couldn't work on it like five years or whatever. Right. Or even longer. So I built something very simple and I put it online. And then I got in touch with, with, with some people in the US who had a company and were looking for interns, but I was looking for an internship. So I went over there and, I interned with them for a couple of months and, they turned out to be people from, from Stanford Center for Computer Research and Music and Acoustics. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The Karma Group. Yeah. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>So, so that's how I, I met some of those people and then I decided when I came back that I, I really wanted to study there, and I was really blown away by <span style="color:red" data-ts="883.7" data-end_ts="883.92" title="883.7" id=c_"883.7">__Sim__</span> Builder, which was like a tool that I had developed at Stanford back then mm-hmm. <affirmative>, which was also kind of like a MaxMSP, but different in that it used to OLA 56 K series of D S P. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>So I came back and, and through, through a pure coincidence <span style="color:red" data-ts="901.19" data-end_ts="901.48" title="901.19" id=c_"901.19">__when__</span>, you know, my parents met somebody at the airport who was like a director of a grant organization in Belgium, and who, who, you know, who told 'em like, well, if you want to go to Stanford, you know, it costs a lot of money, but we have a grant organization you can actually apply for a grant. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>Which was which, and I didn't know anything about <span style="color:red" data-ts="921.08" data-end_ts="921.24" title="921.08" id=c_"921.08">__our__</span> organization. Right. I looked it up and, and I applied, and it was was year of hard work to, to put together, you know, like the case because you <span style="color:red" data-ts="932.16" data-end_ts="932.28" title="932.16" id=c_"932.16">__and__</span> I, you know, all these things you need to do to apply to like Stanford or M I t or whatever, it takes like a lot of work. Right. So I worked on that for a year, and I, I got the grant and I got into, into Stanford, which was like a major thing for me. And so I went over there and, I took their one year master's of arts in music science and technology program, and that's when I started building a hardware. That's like when I really got into hardware, because Max Matthews and <span style="color:red" data-ts="962.56" data-end_ts="962.84" title="962.56" id=c_"962.56">__Bill__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="962.84" data-end_ts="963.04" title="962.84" id=c_"962.84">__for__</span> Plank, I had an amazing interaction design class for, for music. Okay. And there wasn't <span style="color:red" data-ts="968.92" data-end_ts="969.04" title="968.92" id=c_"968.92">__a__</span>, a really great small lab there with oscilloscope and soldering irons and that sort of thing mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Mm-hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b><affirmative>, like for me, that was like the, the, the most interesting course there. It was like the thing that really blew my mind, I think. And because now I could also do hardware. I was not only doing software then I was also doing hardware. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Yeah. I was, I was curious about how you would make that transition, because a lot of people that start off in software find it really difficult to embrace hardware, but, you seem to have made the transition, but I can see that, spending time at Stanford would certainly have made that somewhat easier. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>Yes, it did. And the good thing about the class was like, it was being taken by all sorts of different people from all over Stanford. So there were like mechanical engineers in that class. There were like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1018.76" data-end_ts="1018.98" title="1018.76" id=c_"1018.76">__oh__</span>, music students in that class. Really, really diverse kind of students. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>Which is really great because if you want to put together a small team of a few people to do something, then you can have a computer science guy, you can have a mechanical engineer. You have, you can have a musician, you can have like all the necessary components to do something like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. All the people are just in the same class with you. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>Yeah. So that, that was like, I think a really, like a crucial thing for, for me to get into hardware. And, so I, I, you know, I joined up with Ito Tobee who was <span style="color:red" data-ts="1058.06" data-end_ts="1058.26" title="1058.06" id=c_"1058.06">__in__</span>, an M I T student who was, was, at Stanford, was doing the, the mechanical engineering program at the product realization lab at Stanford. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>And then there was somebody else in the class, Luigi Castelli, who was, who came from Berkeley, and who had actually studied with Richard Boer mm-hmm. <affirmative>, who, who was a, like more of a musician type of person who also knew a lot about dsp. Right. So we teamed up and we, we build this, laser harp. So we wanted to build like a laser harp, like Jean <span style="color:red" data-ts="1092.72" data-end_ts="1093" title="1092.72" id=c_"1092.72">__Michel__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1093" data-end_ts="1093.2" title="1093" id=c_"1093">__Jar__</span> has, but of course much smaller and with more sensors, you know, and easier to transport and that sort of thing. And so we built that and we buil it a a few times, I think maybe four or five times in during that program. So even though the class was already finished, because the class was only like three months. Okay. You know, then next, next quarter <span style="color:red" data-ts="1116.44" data-end_ts="1116.64" title="1116.44" id=c_"1116.44">__or__</span> whatever, you have other classes. Right. We, we just kept going with it and we just kept working on that all year around. And Karma was great in a sense that I would encourage that. Like, it would, it would not mind if you kept <laugh> working on this thing all year <span style="color:red" data-ts="1131.84" data-end_ts="1132.08" title="1131.84" id=c_"1131.84">__long__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>So, so I think that was like a very important thing. And then afterwards, of course, it was only a one year program, then we, we graduated and, you know, they wanted to do some other stuff. And, you know, my program was over and my Visa as well, because it was only like a one year thing. You only get a Visa, visa for one year. Okay. So I had gotten an offer for a PhD to go back to Belgium and to, to, essentially continue the work that I was working on. But then when I, when I got to Belgium, I realized that they didn't have the infrastructure, you know, didn't have the lab over there, didn't have the money, the resources to keep doing that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>So they, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1172.08" data-end_ts="1172.36" title="1172.08" id=c_"1172.08">__they__</span> were, you know, so it was like a situation where I had to go do other things for the lab, or I, I had to figure out how to keep doing what I was doing. So after a while, I decided to, to to quit the PhD program and start ssa. And that's how the company was started because I wanted to keep working on what, what I was doing, essentially. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I am really curious about something. So it seems like, I mean, right now, this idea of going to university and having a lab that has drill presses and soldering irons and oscilloscopes is kind of common, but, at the time that you were going through school, it was, it was just on the edge. You were starting to see like leading edge programs like Karma do that, but generally speaking, that wasn't the case. Now it's much more the case. Do you feel like that's, do you feel like access to that is important for a new generation that's trying to learn this stuff? Or do you think that they might be making it too easy? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>I think it's, it's really good that there is more, more of these tools available for people to do stuff. But then on the other hand, you also have to have the right, the right mindset or the right, the right attitude towards it. So it's not like, as a university, I think it's not, not a matter of like buying those tools. Right. It's also a matter of making them available in a way that, that, that, like, you don't have to ask for permission almost. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's actually, that's a really great point. And, and maybe is a little closer to home than the way I phrased it. It, it does seem like one of the really important parts of your experience with Karma was the fact that you were sharing this class with a bunch of other people, first of all, from different walks of life. So it wasn't just a whole bunch of people who decided they wanted to use soldering irons, or maybe that was just part of what they, how they wanted to do their thing. But the other thing that's really key there is that even after the class was <span style="color:red" data-ts="1296.74" data-end_ts="1296.96" title="1296.74" id=c_"1296.74">__got__</span> done, you had free reign to go into that lab. That's, that's, that seems to me to be the real powerful part of this. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>Yes. Because, you know, sometimes you have schools and, you know, they, they, they decide to invest in infrastructure, but then the infrastructure is not available to the students the way it should be. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>You know, and they, and you have to, you know, do this or do that, or like, you know, can only use it in that way or this way or whatever, or, you know, or there's like departmental things, you know, that are going on or whatever. And I think if, if you have a university where, where it's really free and accessible and, and nobody's really keeping you from doing something, I think that's like a really important thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure, sure. Now I wanna go back a little bit, again, talking a little bit about your education, going way back to when you said that you were doing, you <span style="color:red" data-ts="1353.08" data-end_ts="1353.12" title="1353.08" id=c_"1353.08">__know__</span>, studying classical music and sort of the frustration then I too grew up at a time when the only sort of like educational background for music was related to classical music. Did, I felt like there were things that I learned from that that were important and a lot of things that just bored me <laugh>. Right. For you, was it, were there things that you learned from that process that you still use or still depend on today? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>Well, I think there are good things that I, you know, that I did pick up going through classical music education. You know, like we, like, I had the first, I mean, with the first piano teacher I had that was like the, the normal piano teacher that you get through school. But then afterwards I switched to a private teacher, Uhhuh 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>Because, because <span style="color:red" data-ts="1406.54" data-end_ts="1406.76" title="1406.54" id=c_"1406.54">__the__</span>, the time I could spend with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1408.28" data-end_ts="1408.4" title="1408.28" id=c_"1408.28">__a__</span> teacher in school was, was like 15 minutes a week or something, which was not gonna get me much further. Right. So, so I, I had this old lady who would be like, really push her students to get to like, develop technique on a piano. Okay. And so, and so that's something that I, that I, I think i, I benefit benefited from to have technique. And then of course also, you know, being able to side read and that sort of thing. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. You 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>Know, but then on the other hand, I mean, I, I don't really use those skills, you know, because I don't really actively play music that way or anything like that, you know what I mean? So it's good to have those skills, but I don't really use those. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Are you, are you actively performing now? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>No, no, no. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1457.56" data-end_ts="1457.6" title="1457.56" id=c_"1457.56">__At__</span> all because I, I, I really wanted to take some, I really wanted to take some distance from playing the piano because I, I, I almost wanted to forget that, that part to be able to come back to the piano and to be able to approach it like a beginning jazz musician would do it or something. Sure, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>Not having this, this bad taste in my mouth anymore, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Right. So do you, do you see you giving yourself time to do that? Because it seems like just the process of running a company that's developing hardware with this huge software backbone, it seems like that would keep you pretty busy and it would be a little tough to take on a reintroduction into the piano. Is that something you think you'll be able to do? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>It's definitely something I don't have time for right now, because I have, I have so much going on with, with development for audio cubes that I just, I just don't get around to it, you know, to really playing, playing an instrument again that way. I mean, no, I just don't get around to it, to be honest. Sure. I mean, I would love to at some point, but right now I, I, I just have too much going on to do that, so. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So let's talk about your audio cube development, because my understanding is that you have really been, burning the midnight oil on a new release. Can you explain a little bit about what you've got in the pipeline? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>Of course. Yeah. So, so like I explained, when the, when the cubes were originally launched, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1546.4" data-end_ts="1546.52" title="1546.4" id=c_"1546.4">__I__</span> didn't have a, the wireless module, which allows them to form this star network. And so, when I designed the module, then I, then I then started working with a friend on, on the firmware implementation for the protocol that we wanted to use. But then of course, I mean, the first version of that firmware and the protocol, it, I mean, it, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1569.76" data-end_ts="1569.88" title="1569.76" id=c_"1569.76">__it__</span>, it worked, but it didn't work the way I wanted it to work. Like, for example, it would not give you all the data simultaneously. So it was like either detecting cubes or it was sensing the environment, but it would not make sense distance to other cubes and it would not detect the other cubes while simultaneous, simultaneously giving you distance information to <span style="color:red" data-ts="1591.84" data-end_ts="1592" title="1591.84" id=c_"1591.84">__other__</span> cubes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>Okay. So that, I mean, it, it had all these limitations and I wanted to have all that data available simultaneously. So essentially, and also I wanted it to work much faster. I really wanted to have a really high update rate. So I decided to ba to basically rewrite all the firmware and rewrite the library and rewrite the mini <span style="color:red" data-ts="1615.6" data-end_ts="1615.88" title="1615.6" id=c_"1615.6">__bridge__</span>, which is like the main application that you used to connect auto cubes to other music software. And so that was a really big thing because I had to figure out how to, how to build a protocol that would work for this star network and where every cube would be able to to sense its environment and then submit its information and then all the information from all the cubes would have to be merged to form like the state of the network essentially. Sure. You know, with all the sensor data <span style="color:red" data-ts="1646.02" data-end_ts="1646.24" title="1646.02" id=c_"1646.02">__and__</span> all the distance, you know, all the detection information and all that. So that was a pretty tricky thing thing to do. And it also, because it has to work in real time and when, you know, when a cube goes away and it comes back, you have to handle all those cases. Like what do you do if you disconnect the whole network and you're on stage, but then you plug it back in? Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>Does everything come back automatically? And what do you do if somebody walks off the stage with a cube and it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1673.62" data-end_ts="1673.84" title="1673.62" id=c_"1673.62">__on__</span> range and then comes back into range, or you turn it off and turn it back on? Or what if a battery dies and you have to swap two cubes? Right. You know, the one that is plugged in, you unplug it and then you plug the one with the dead battery back in, so it can charge from the computer, but then all the other ones have to like join the new cube, which is like the new, the new master cube. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>So you have these endless things that you have to think about and it all has to work in real time and it has to work fast enough because musicians are really demanding as, you know, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, indeed. Well, I'll tell you, as you start laying out some of the complexity of the system, I find it remarkable then when I see like my friend Mark using these things in real time, and I see him swapping things out and plugging things in on the fly. And so I realized that all of those kind of failover systems and all that stuff are in use constantly. It's not like these are necessarily special exceptions just because working on stage with any piece of equipment, but especially a wireless piece of equipment is just craziness all the time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>It's, I mean, you would think <span style="color:red" data-ts="1744.35" data-end_ts="1744.64" title="1744.35" id=c_"1744.35">__it's__</span> exactly like you say, you'd think, okay, I don't, you know, I don't need all those <span style="color:red" data-ts="1747.64" data-end_ts="1748" title="1747.64" id=c_"1747.64">__special__</span>, special situations or <span style="color:red" data-ts="1749.6" data-end_ts="1749.72" title="1749.6" id=c_"1749.6">__I__</span> don't arrive or whatever, but I mean, if you're <span style="color:red" data-ts="1752.16" data-end_ts="1752.24" title="1752.16" id=c_"1752.16">__a__</span> live performer, you know, guaranteed, you know, those situations will come up. Oh 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Absolutely. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1757.32" data-end_ts="1757.52" title="1757.32" id=c_"1757.32">__And__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>Something will happen and you'll have to, like, your system has to be able to deal with it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. You have done all of this rewriting and, and you basically, you went from sort of cubes being what they are to being wireless, to being, to now being much faster and, having more data sense sensing. Do, do the cubes require hardware updates in order to take on this new development? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>Yeah, so the cubes, there is a tool that we provide that allows you to upgrade the firmware of the cubes. Okay. And it's, it's, it's very easy. I mean, you, you basically just push the on on off button of the cube and you hold it for a couple seconds, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1798.54" data-end_ts="1798.76" title="1798.54" id=c_"1798.54">__and__</span> then the cube turns blue and that's like the sign you can plug it into upgrade the firmer, and then there is a little tool and you start it and you drop drag and drop a file, and then it just flashes for a couple of seconds and that's it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But you don't have to change out any of the hardware at all. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>No, you don't have to change the hardware. Although if you, if you bought your cubes like let's say in 2007 or oh eight, then you do need the hardware upgrade. Like you do need this module, but you can actually get the, the module from us and you can install it yourself, if you have some, you know, some basic like technical skills. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, I think it's pretty amazing that you have a piece of hardware that was available in 2008 that still operates and is getting faster, you know, because of your software development is getting faster here in 2015. Do you mind telling us what kind of hardware is inside of that thing? It must be something you really are in love with. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>Yeah, it's, I mean, I designed the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1862" data-end_ts="1862.2" title="1862" id=c_"1862">__motor__</span> board of the Cube and, the original motor board, and I'd also designed, the wireless module for it. Okay. And so at the time when I designed the motor board, I didn't even know that we would have a wireless module, but I put an expansion port on the motherboard, which, allowed me then later on to, to develop a wireless add-on that plugs into the expansion port, essentially. Interesting. So the main <span style="color:red" data-ts="1885.2" data-end_ts="1885.84" title="1885.2" id=c_"1885.2">__motherboard__</span> of, of the cube uses an arm processor. So what the, the cube actually does <span style="color:red" data-ts="1889.62" data-end_ts="1889.84" title="1889.62" id=c_"1889.62">__is__</span> it does signal processing. It does signal processing, but like I said, not of audio signals, but it generates optical signals, it processes optical signals. It does, it does all that. And then there is a co-processor which handles all the protocol stuff. Got <span style="color:red" data-ts="1903.6" data-end_ts="1903.64" title="1903.6" id=c_"1903.6">__it__</span>. There's another processor that is responsible for like, you know, taking data from the other processor and like, you know, packaging it and like decoding it and encoding it and all that sort of stuff. Sure. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1914.66" data-end_ts="1914.88" title="1914.66" id=c_"1914.66">__Ing__</span> with the network and all that. So yeah, so that's kind of how, how the cubes work. But it's, it's still the same motor <span style="color:red" data-ts="1922.88" data-end_ts="1923.2" title="1922.88" id=c_"1922.88">__board__</span> from like that we initially released, but now there is the wireless upgrade, and today if you buy another cube system, it, it comes with the wireless module installed. Of course. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Of course. Sure. Now, I want to go back to when you were first designing the first set of audio cubes. I'm a little blown away just going through the process in my head because first of all, the audio cubes use this kind of semi-transparent, very textually, enjoyable to feel kind of rubbery plasticy stuff. I don't know what material that actually is. But then you built in colored lighting that could be controlled by this microprocessor and was bright enough to shine through the cube material. You developed a motherboard and, with a co-processor on it, you developed all these communication protocols. How long did it take you to develop this damn thing? Because it seems like you've had to figure out just about every manufacturing process that there is in order to produce these things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>Yeah, so when I, I mean, when I started working on it in 2004, I had some really basic prototypes and, it, it, I think it took me until 2007 to get the first version of the Auto Cubes, done. And at that point, you know, there was very little software, and the software was actually really crappy. It was, it was very, very rudimentary. You know, it was like I had, I had sort of underestimated the amount of work it would be Right when I, when I got into it, and I, I, I wanted to do U SS B for example, on the Audit Cube and doing U S B on a new device. Like when, when you're not all too familiar with the processor yet, and you're still like learning your way around the processor that you're using, but then you also have to implement U S B, right? It's a major thing because the U S B standard is an enormously complex thing, and it's also implemented and handled differently on different platforms. So even though the standard says, you know, when this happens, then you have to do this or whatever. But then when you go buy tools and you like an analyzer, like U S B analyzer, whatever, and you put it on your com computer and you put a device over it, then you realize that the operating system is not actually doing what's written in the standard. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>So there is this thing, again, it's sort of like with Bluetooth that the consortium of people who like work on U S B, they write this standard and they build this thing, but it's like super complicated for a small company to, to build a U S B device. So I got into that, but so the majority of my time was like, over those three years was like, spend on, that was like a, a really, a really big thing. So I got the cubes to the market, and then of course after that, you know, I started, I realized, okay, we need better software. We have to build cross-platform software. How do we do that? You know? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, and then how do we, and then from there, okay, what, you know, what other things do we need? Do we, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2120.84" data-end_ts="2120.96" title="2120.84" id=c_"2120.84">__I__</span>, you know, it started with Media <span style="color:red" data-ts="2121.88" data-end_ts="2122.16" title="2121.88" id=c_"2121.88">__Bridge__</span>, which was like application that <span style="color:red" data-ts="2124" data-end_ts="2124.16" title="2124" id=c_"2124">__you__</span> use to connect to cubes network to other software or hardware. So it turns the data from the cubes into metadata, which you can send wherever you want. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Then 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>We <span style="color:red" data-ts="2134.24" data-end_ts="2134.36" title="2134.24" id=c_"2134.24">__realized__</span>, okay, we have to build our own applications because the, the problem is that if we, if we only send data over MIDI to other applications, like let's say Ableton Live <span style="color:red" data-ts="2146.8" data-end_ts="2146.92" title="2146.8" id=c_"2146.8">__R__</span> so then, you know, when, when, when that software was developed, there were no cubes. Right. Actually, or you know, the cubes were not, I mean, nobody knew about the cubes really yet, so, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So it couldn't take maximum advantage of 'em. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>Exactly. So you have all these possibilities that the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2164.73" data-end_ts="2164.89" title="2164.73" id=c_"2164.73">__other__</span> cubes can offer, but then the software can only use a part of it because it's not designed for that. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>And so that's what, that's what we realized I think around 2008, and that's when we said, okay, you know, we started working on our own applications and our own instruments to take advantage of the cubes as much as possible. Sure. And of course, meanwhile I, you know, I started rewriting, you know, the whole wireless thing. I mean, that took quite a while. And then we released updates for the wireless golf course free of charge for all the people who wanted to use it. And, so yeah, so we started building some of our own applications. I think in 2009. We, we created this generative sequencing application called Improviser, which started as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_(software)">Max/MSP</a> patch. Okay. And so it's basically an application where every cube like runs a, runs a loop, and when you put two cubes together, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2218.32" data-end_ts="2218.61" title="2218.32" id=c_"2218.32">__then__</span> the notes add, add up, and they subtract. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, okay. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>So every cube has its own loop, but the loop is relative to a root note. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Got it. So,

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>And so the way you, you get the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2230.25" data-end_ts="2230.41" title="2230.25" id=c_"2230.25">__note__</span> that is being played is by, let's say taking one step from one cube, which is plus three, and then another one from another cube minus two. And then you add that, that up with a root note, and then you, you end up with the node that's going to be played. So it's kind of a generative sequencing system where you use the cubes to play music in real time, and you, you put in the pitches and you put in the velocities, and then the music that comes out is sort of automatically generated because of the position of the cubes. So I started to develop, develop these kind of ideas like application ideas and, you know, some of them like improvise were interesting, other <span style="color:red" data-ts="2263.57" data-end_ts="2263.81" title="2263.57" id=c_"2263.57">__work__</span> not so interesting, like <span style="color:red" data-ts="2265.19" data-end_ts="2265.61" title="2265.19" id=c_"2265.19">__Evolve__</span>, which was more like an L F O kind of thing. Okay. But it was like the, the, all of those ideas were sort of like the breeding ground for the synthesizer that, that we're now working on, which is called <inaudible>, and which will be built into <span style="color:red" data-ts="2278.83" data-end_ts="2279.05" title="2278.83" id=c_"2278.83">__mid__</span> bridge, essentially we will, we're extending <span style="color:red" data-ts="2281.33" data-end_ts="2281.53" title="2281.33" id=c_"2281.33">__mid__</span> bridge with audio and d s P possibilities. So you don't have, you don't need anything else anymore. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Got it. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2288.75" data-end_ts="2288.97" title="2288.75" id=c_"2288.75">__You__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>Buy the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2289.37" data-end_ts="2289.53" title="2289.37" id=c_"2289.37">__audio__</span> cubes and it comes with a free synthesizer and it's essentially a digital model or synthesizer. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well that makes a lot of sense too, because then you can demo it with, or you can tell people how to test and use the system without having to know what equipment or what software they're currently using. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>Exactly. Yeah. Then it's much easier, like if you have a computer and it makes sound, or it has a sound card, you can connect <span style="color:red" data-ts="2313.41" data-end_ts="2313.57" title="2313.41" id=c_"2313.41">__the__</span> cubes to it and you can make music and sounds with it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It, it seems like there's a ton of different applications that could work for that. The cubes could be work well for, I mean, some of 'em are, I think what you're focused on, which is working with performing musicians who want a different interface with their music. And similarly with studio development and stuff like that. But there's also things like, audio installation, art type work, or even, and probably most interesting might be the education market. To what extent have you seen, audio cubes being used in those kind of environments? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>So there are, a couple of artists in, in Europe that I know of, Kim Peterson from, from Dream <span style="color:red" data-ts="2364.78" data-end_ts="2365" title="2364.78" id=c_"2364.78">__Hub__</span>, who has built installations using the Cubes. I think he did an installation in the church. I can't remember the name of the project, but, it was like a, a big <span style="color:red" data-ts="2374.36" data-end_ts="2374.56" title="2374.36" id=c_"2374.36">__auto__</span> cubes installation in a quite well known church in Denmark, I think. And then, he also played at the climate conference with the Cubes. And then in, education, there <span style="color:red" data-ts="2386.32" data-end_ts="2386.48" title="2386.32" id=c_"2386.32">__are__</span> some schools, in Colorado where they're using the cubes with, with small kids, you know, so the music teacher uses the cubes with small kids, and he uses able <span style="color:red" data-ts="2396.44" data-end_ts="2396.6" title="2396.44" id=c_"2396.44">__to__</span> live, and the kids, you know, can trigger loops and, you know, play with effects and, you know, apply effects to their voice while, while holding a cube and, you know, waving their hands around the cubes and that sort of thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>So it is definitely used in, in STEM medication, you know, where there is a music teacher who wants to show what you can do with technology in music. And the cubes are a very inviting, sort of non-threatening piece of technology. It's, it's, you know, it's a group of wireless objects that lights up. Right. They're almost like lambs. So it's not like it's a computer that is intimidating using a computer, but you're not necessarily, you know, intimidated by it. It's not like a, it's not, it's not like computers can sometimes be associated with men or like with, with like, because of the male dominance in, in computers and in it computer science, that, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2449.6" data-end_ts="2449.76" title="2449.6" id=c_"2449.6">__so__</span> cubes are like a neutral thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. They don't have a predefined <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_(software)">Jitter</a> bias. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>Right. So, so I think that's, that's also where it is great in, in stem. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. The STEM thing is actually really interesting and, and I know that there are plenty of people that are trying to turn stem into steam by adding arts into it, but regardless of whether they're successful or not, it strikes me that there are an awful lot of ways to get interplay between engineering type thinking and musical artistic type thinking. And so it seems to me like the cubes are, are really potentially great because they're inviting and because they're technology, but also because since they don't look like any other instrument you've ever used, you're sort of free to imagine something brand new and then try and make it 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>Yes. That's, that's, that's very true. So like, it's, it's like what the cubes have, I mean, it's, it's difficult because it's like an abstract thing, but then because it's an abstract thing, it doesn't, it doesn't necessarily push you to think about it in a certain way. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. It's like, I mean the sort of like the opposite equivalent of that. I've seen a lot of people do kind of interesting artistic tools using the, the old, rock band guitar controller, but everyone I've ever seen use, it makes something that sounds and plays and acts like a guitar <laugh>, there's gotta be something else you could do with that other than make guitar legs, you know? So I think that's one of the real advantages of the cube. So in your experience and in working with users, what's the most complicated cube system that anyone's put together? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>I think like one of the, one of the, it's actually, I think Mark, mark Musher was recently working on a patch, featuring the, the new topology stuff, which uses UI a synthesizer. I don't think it's out yet. So I, I can't say too much about it. That's like up to Mark to <span style="color:red" data-ts="2572.76" data-end_ts="2573.08" title="2572.76" id=c_"2572.76">__decide__</span> when he wants to show that to the world. But I think that was like, I was really blown away by that <span style="color:red" data-ts="2577.94" data-end_ts="2578.16" title="2577.94" id=c_"2577.94">__by__</span>, by the kind of mappings. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I think he shared that video with me. That's the one where he maps the, the cable connections of UE <span style="color:red" data-ts="2586.78" data-end_ts="2587" title="2586.78" id=c_"2586.78">__ace__</span> so that you're literally changing the wired connections using the audio cube is that's the one you're thinking of. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>Yes, and I was, I was really like, I, I was really impressed by that because it's, the topology thing is takes some time to understand what it actually is. Uhhuh <affirmative>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Even 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>Though it's a relatively simple concept, like, you know, you have detection information between the cubes and you have distance information between the cubes. So essentially you get all this network information that you can use to link things together, which exist in your computer. So when you put two cubes together, two things in your computer will be connected together. Right. So it's a relatively simple idea, but to get your head around it and to map it, let's say using UI <span style="color:red" data-ts="2629.12" data-end_ts="2629.24" title="2629.12" id=c_"2629.12">__u__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2629.24" data-end_ts="2629.44" title="2629.24" id=c_"2629.24">__he__</span> ace, is definitely <span style="color:red" data-ts="2631.22" data-end_ts="2631.44" title="2631.22" id=c_"2631.22">__was__</span> like impressed and blown away by that. Like the way the way Mark did that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, he actually got you and I together for this podcast. He's long been a big fan of the audio cubes. And he shared, he showed me that, and yeah, this, the topology thing, it makes sense, but coming to the point where you feel comfortable making those kind of mappings and then performing with them, I have to give Mark credit for having, having taken sort of like that leap of faith to be able to do that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>Yeah. I think, at first he, I mean he had to spend some time with it to understand how it worked, worked, but then he, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2671.75" data-end_ts="2671.97" title="2671.75" id=c_"2671.75">__at__</span> the moment, he got the hang of it. He, he realized the power of it and the possibilities of it, and he and he, went off and created this amazing mapping. So I mean, the reason we <span style="color:red" data-ts="2682.52" data-end_ts="2682.76" title="2682.52" id=c_"2682.52">__were__</span>, we are building the synth, that I mentioned is such that people don't have to do those mappings. Right. So we know those mappings are automatically done for you when you use our synthesizer. You don't have to think about, you know, I need to send these kind of mini messages and I have to, has to, I have to map it like this or that. I mean, if you want that, you can do that, you know, and you can build Maximus <span style="color:red" data-ts="2705.48" data-end_ts="2705.6" title="2705.48" id=c_"2705.48">__p__</span> patches and you know, and hook them up to the cubes and do whatever you want. But if you don't want to do that or you don't have the time for that, then you can use our synthesizer. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, and, and even, even beyond that, some you may have in your mind that you want to use Max or whatever to create the ultimate thing, but sometimes when you buy something, you spend the money on it, you kind of want to have fun with it right now, <laugh>, you know. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>Exactly. Yeah. And 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It seems like this built-in synthesizer gives you the opportunity to say, alright, five minutes into this process, you can at least have some fun. So that's, that's great too. Okay, so given the timeframe that you gave us just a few minutes ago, you have been working on the cubes in one fashion or another for a decade now, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>Yes. Yeah, that's, that's correct. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Do you ever get sick of the cubes, <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b><laugh>? I think, yeah, I mean, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2761.48" data-end_ts="2761.6" title="2761.48" id=c_"2761.48">__I__</span> mean, I think anybody who works on a, on a project like that long, you know, sometimes just wants to, you know, drop it, drop it for a, you know, for a couple of weeks and go do something else, right? I mean, so I have, I, I also have some of these moments just like everybody, but then people are also really excited and you know, when they, when they use the cubes <span style="color:red" data-ts="2782.12" data-end_ts="2782.28" title="2782.12" id=c_"2782.12">__and__</span> people email all the time, you know, and then that's when you see, okay, there are people out there using this and they're having a great time, and that, that's in the end also why you do it. Why, you know why I'm doing this, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That ends up being great motivation, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>Yeah. Yeah. People are, people are, people love it. So you keep doing it, essentially. So <laugh>, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Do you have, do you have any plans to do another kind of hardware or maybe expand your software work? I mean, this synthesizer certainly sounds like an extensive project. Do you have anything else that you're thinking of taking on at any point? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>Yeah, I mean, I have some ideas about other stuff, but I think it's will mostly circulate around, you know, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2825.52" data-end_ts="2825.8" title="2825.52" id=c_"2825.52">__auto__</span> cubes world or like in the auto cubes, you know, area. So, I mean, I have some ideas about making the cubes work without a computer, so you don't actually have to have a laptop. Sure. Right. So for example, I mean, integration with analog <span style="color:red" data-ts="2840.76" data-end_ts="2841" title="2840.76" id=c_"2840.76">__model__</span> synthesizers is something that is, that I wanted to, I want to look closer at and that I want to do. That makes a lot of sense. So yeah, I'm, I'm thinking about ways to make the cubes work for musicians who don't want to use computers or, you know, they can't use computers or Right. It's definitely something I want to do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, I think that's actually a really interesting, interesting point because it does seem like the return to hardware is full, full on, you know, people are starting to say, I look at the computer all day. I don't want to necessarily look at the computer for my creative life as well. But, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2879.72" data-end_ts="2879.96" title="2879.72" id=c_"2879.72">__dunno__</span>, there's, I think there's both, there's two sides to that story. And also those things ebb and flow. You never know what's gonna be important in people's minds at any given time. So I want to thank you so much, bur for spending the time talking about this <span style="color:red" data-ts="2899.03" data-end_ts="2899.32" title="2899.03" id=c_"2899.03">__talk__</span>, giving us some insights on how you designed <span style="color:red" data-ts="2901.76" data-end_ts="2901.96" title="2901.76" id=c_"2901.76">__to__</span> develop the, the audio cubes. And sort of like, like your vision for the near future. I, this release is coming out this week, did you say? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>Yes, probably end of the week, early next week. The new Media <span style="color:red" data-ts="2917.44" data-end_ts="2917.68" title="2917.44" id=c_"2917.44">__British__</span> release will be out. We'll be emailing about that on our newsletter and we'll, you know, put up some videos and that sort of thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="2925.88" data-end_ts="2926.04" title="2925.88" id=c_"2925.88">__the__</span> people who are interested in audio cubes, where, where on the web should they go to take Check it out. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>They can go to, persa.com <span style="color:red" data-ts="2934.5" data-end_ts="2934.72" title="2934.5" id=c_"2934.5">__and__</span> Persa is spelled, P E R C U S S A. And, of course, they can also check out our YouTube channel@youtube.com, slash user slash persa. If you type in pers cubes on YouTube, you can also find a bunch of videos that, that <span style="color:red" data-ts="2950.56" data-end_ts="2950.8" title="2950.56" id=c_"2950.56">__Mark__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2950.85" data-end_ts="2951.2" title="2950.85" id=c_"2950.85">__Moher__</span> and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2951.36" data-end_ts="2951.52" title="2951.36" id=c_"2951.36">__other__</span> people did. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's fantastic. Well, good luck with, with your work on this and with your continued success with Persa and the development of the Cubes. I think it's really exciting and fun stuff. It's almost alien. It's so different from everybody else's work, but, I find it fascinating. Wonderful. And so good luck with that. Keep, keep rocking <span style="color:red" data-ts="2973.08" data-end_ts="2973.24" title="2973.08" id=c_"2973.08">__it__</span>. All right, man. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Bert: </b>Thank you so much, Darwin 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, great. Thanks a lot. I'll talk to you soon. All right. A big thanks to Bert for, talking with us about the development and ongoing work on the audio cubes. I just <span style="color:red" data-ts="2994.4" data-end_ts="2994.64" title="2994.4" id=c_"2994.4">__want__</span> to thank all of you as listeners for sticking with the podcast.
