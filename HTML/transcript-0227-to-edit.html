<b>Darwin: </b>All right. Today I am visiting an old friend. This is a guy I first knew him when he was still in school. He is definitely not in school anymore. He is, ripping up the place. He's, his name is Jeff Snyder. He, we actually visited him for the first time back in podcast number 34. We had a, we had a great talk then about his background coming up through the system in Columbia and, developing what at the time was my favorite control surface, which was the Schneider Phonics Manta. Well, the, the Manta still exists. It's in a version three. He's also come up with some new products. He's got some other stuff cooking in the background, I think I can hear. So with that, we'll say hello to Jeff Schneider. Hey, Jeff. How's it going? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff Snyder (Snyderphonics): </b>Hi, Darwin. How's it going? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright. Thanks a lot for, taking a break and having a chat with me. I appreciate it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Yeah, definitely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>If people really wanna know about your background, I'm gonna ask them to head back to your old podcast number 34. That'll be a, that'll be a good shout back to back when I was like, I don't even think I'd gone through puberty yet. I had, yeah, no, I had that really high voice. It was Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Pretty Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What I do wanna do is kind of get caught up on what's, what's gone on since then. I mean, back then you had, you had the Manta out for a little while, and, you were kind of, you were just about to, I think, I think you were just about to start a new job at Princeton, or else you had just started it. But 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>I think I just started, yeah, just 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Started. Okay. Well, what's what's been happening since then? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>I'm still working at Princeton. My job has changed a little bit now. I'm director of electronic music there, which is really nice. I teach the electronic music classes and I run this thing called the Princeton Laptop Orchestra, also known as <span style="color:red" data-ts="121.605" data-end_ts="121.805" title="121.605" id=c_"121.605">__Plur__</span>. So that takes up quite a lot of my time. And then I've kept going with Snyder Phonics, that's my company, making weird electronic musical instruments while also trying to keep up <span style="color:red" data-ts="133.805" data-end_ts="133.925" title="133.805" id=c_"133.805">__a__</span> career as a composer and a improviser. So that's to what I do these days, are those things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Do you, do you leave yourself any time to sleep at all? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Yeah, sometimes. Yeah. <laugh>? No, I really like sleeping, so, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So let's start off, before we get into talking about the Snyder Phonics stuff. Let's talk a little bit about the Princeton stuff. So, director of electronic music, that sounds pretty interesting. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. How does electronic music fit into the general music? The general area of music study, I think that it has, it has always been kind of like this weird second cousin in most music Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> environments. And I'm just wondering in that, in the case of Princeton, where does, where does it kind of sit 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Generally in academia? I feel like more and more it's becoming sort of less the, the random second cousin that might be there or not, and more the necessary part of music education. Right. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I've definitely seen that happen even since I was in grad school, more and more. Princeton is unusual because, which you may know, it's got a long history. It's got a 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Hell of a history. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Yeah. That, you know, that goes back into the fifties. There was, something called the Columbia Princeton Electronic Music Center that was set up that was really the first institutional electronic music center that really was working on research and what electronic music could be. So it's pretty exciting to be working here where there's that kind of tradition going back so far, RCA made this giant, synthesizer called the RCA Mark two that the Columbia Prince and Electronic Music Center bought, and they installed it and figured out how to make all kinds of crazy stuff on it. And then after that, you know, that was kind of the early period is late fifties into the sixties, then they got a <span style="color:red" data-ts="240.885" data-end_ts="241.245" title="240.885" id=c_"240.885">__booklet__</span> synth, and they started doing really interesting things with that. And then eventually, like by the time the eighties rolled around, there was a lot of work in, it was at the forefront of digital music. So, Paul Lansky was working here at the time, and Right. Kind of developed a lot of really interesting digital music techniques that I think were very influential. Then, I don't know, into the nineties, Dan Truman was doing, he's still here and he was, electronic music pioneer in a lot of ways. Have you interviewed Dan Truman yet? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I have. He's, yeah. He's a fascinating guy. Yeah. More, more energy than practically anyone I'd ever met. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>That is, that is definitely true. <laugh>. So <laugh> and he, he is actually the guy who, started this laptop orchestra thing, which I now have taken over, directorship of. So, I don't know, I feel like, and, and the laptop orchestra idea, you know, there's, there's a lot of predecessors to it with the hub out on the west coast. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, back in the eighties, you know, there were some groups in Europe that were kind of similar to this concept, but the whole sort of American academic laptop orchestra thing has kind of come into existence based on this Princeton model, which is kind of exciting. So, so it's had a, it's had a lot of influence in Princeton. There's a, I feel like due to that, there's a relatively big presence for electronic music, and it's not, it's not something I have to argue too much about, whether it's important or not, you know? Right. Which I think a lot of academic colleagues and other institutions maybe do <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, I think they do. Because a lot of times I think people kick will be willing to have an electronic music thing as long as it, as it ends up look looking like a music technology thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="353.255" data-end_ts="353.605" title="353.255" id=c_"353.255">__Right__</span>. Which, that's where maybe some of the history that Princeton brings to the game, prevents that prevents it from falling down that hole. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Yeah. It's always been under the, well, traditionally at Princeton, it was under the, in the realm of the composers where Milton Babbitt sort of initiated this Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Right. And then in the nineties, it, it, there was this real connection between computer science and, and the music department when Perry Cook was here too. So I feel like there's always been, it's always been about people doing creative things with electronics rather than, sort of more recording engineering kind of things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Not to say that recording engineering can't be creative, but <laugh> as in, you know, more the creation rather than the, in terms of the support of it. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Right. So how intimidating is it being the director of electronic music when the people that preceded you were like, Truman and Lansky and some of these just like jaw dropping people in history? How, how intimidating is that 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b><laugh>? I don't know. I guess I don't feel too intimidated because I'm just kind of doing my own thing with it. So, <laugh>, I guess the thing that I, I feel like the challenge is, is how do I make, how do I keep electronic music at Princeton at the forefront in a way, right. Or how do I, how do I keep us always doing new things? Right? Right. So I see that as my responsibility, really. Like how do we make, how do we make electronic music at Princeton always kind of be really interesting and not just fall into whatever we are used to doing. But luckily, I kind of feel like that's what I'm most interested in doing anyway, is always something different than what I was doing before. So, I don't know. So, so for me, it's not too, not too stressful. <span style="color:red" data-ts="459.355" data-end_ts="459.575" title="459.355" id=c_"459.355">__No__</span>, it's, I think I've done okay so far. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That's interesting. Well, and it's, it's kind of wild though to think of like needing, you know, wanting to keep things fresh and one, keep things moving forward when in a way you kind of have the, this responsibility two, to kind of uphold a tradition. I mean, at this point, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="479.575" data-end_ts="479.695" title="479.575" id=c_"479.575">__Ric__</span> has the Princeton laptop orchestra that has to feel like there's not only the opportunity to do something interesting, but there's also this tradition of what it was, and, and, you know, maintaining that. How do you, how do you take something that is kind of, that sealed in a spot in history and allow it to change and grow and evolve into, into the thing it needs to be now? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Yeah, that's a good question. I, I feel, I feel really lucky in the situation that I'm in, in that, so, Perry Cook's retired, but both him and Dan Truman and Dan Truman's, you know, still super active and we're colleagues here, but Dan Truman's kind of like, he does not care about laptop orchestra retaining any kind of tradition of what it is or having a repertoire that continues, or, I mean, he just kind of wants it to be, be whatever it should be at that moment. Right. I felt very relieved when he kind of expressed that to me that he is like, you know, laptop orchestra should just evolve however you think it needs to evolve. Right, sure. And, and that's been good for me because actually, I think if you asked me, so I, I, I started over here eight years ago, but I, I sort of have my position's changed a few times, and I've been directing the laptop orchestra alone for six years now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>I feel like I never really get bored with it because I'm always, every year it's a different group of people and I'm working on different research projects, and it's like, okay, how, who's, who's got cool ideas? What are we gonna do? And really, I don't think too much about like redoing repertoire or trying to keep anything the same or keep any kind of continuity. I basically just throw that away. So, interesting. <laugh>, one thing we have that's, that's a little bit of continuity that's helpful is we have some physical in infrastructure, which, we don't have to use, but it's handy, which is that we have these little hemispheric six channel speakers, that can be kind of little independent, individual sound systems for everybody. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I was wondering if you were still using those, because that was sort of like one of the visual, components of the original laptop orchestra was those hemispheric speakers. I mean, it, it's sort of like you'd see that, you'd see people kinda like kneeling in front of their laptop with those in front of 'em, and that was sort of like the indicator that's like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="623.475" data-end_ts="623.695" title="623.475" id=c_"623.475">__oh__</span> hell, this is something new. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Yeah. Yeah, we're still using 'em for sure, right now. I mean, they, the real advantage of that kind of system is basically just the advantage of when you have a whole bunch of computers in a room. If you're using computers, and you want a bunch of people playing together with electronic sound, it, if you all go into a pa it immediately becomes impossible to tell who's doing what. Right. So, having individualized sound systems, I think is the most important thing in that world, once the number of players gets high enough. But also just, you know, the hemispherical thing, I think is a more subtle thing, which is just, it's really nice to have individual amplifiers that aren't like a beam the way a guitar amp is. And, you know, that goes to the player's ear, but also goes to everybody else in the room's ear in a way that gives directional cues so everybody can improvise together and know that, oh, this person's making that sound right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>And it becomes not something you have to think about because you can just tell who's doing what. Sure. So that's really nice. But we don't always use those, you know, it's because they also have downsides there. It's basically six car speakers on a, on a little <laugh>, you know, case and doesn't have that much base response. So we couple 'em with a little subwoofer, but really like, you know, if you're doing, choosing between that or hooking to a sound system that has an amazing subwoofer or, you know, sometimes it makes more sense to go to house sound if we have a small number of people or, you know, maybe we, we wanna do something with Spatialization around the audience, but we wanna be on stage. You know, there's also all kinds of situations in which we just have to say, okay, what's the right, what's the right tool for this job? Sure. But, but we end up using those hemis all the time in rehearsal, and it's fantastic. We call 'em the hemis, the hemis, the hemispherical speakers. Yeah. Right. There's a, there's one of the people who originally developed the Hemi speakers with, so it was Dan Truman, Perry Cook, Scott Smallwood, and, Stephan Moore kind of developed them together, and Stephan Moore has started a little company selling them called Isabel. So you can like buy your own hemispherical speaker thing now, which is kind of cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Very interesting. Now, so in, in the time that you've been working with them, what, what has actually changed other than the repertoire? What, have you had any, like equipment changes? Is there different, is, has there been changes in like the, the software that people generally use or compose with or compose for? Are you seeing any changes along those lines? <span style="color:red" data-ts="779.845" data-end_ts="780.125" title="779.845" id=c_"779.845">__Yeah__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>I wonder not, I mean, basically just a lot of things change all the time. I'm trying to think of what's consistent more, <laugh>, I mean, I tend to work in Max MSP and Chuck are the two music languages that I work in. So a lot of the patches that I develop, and I also teach both those languages in my electronic music classes. Okay. So a lot of work that comes directly out of the ensemble tends to use those languages. Sometimes the grad students are coming in, no, super collider, so we get a lot of pieces in Super Collider too. But basically, you know, one thing that's been consistent is we try to use free software all the time because when you have like, you know, 10 people on their own laptops, you can't distribute any kind of software that requires a license easily and perform with that. So, basically, well, you know, so I mean, I mentioned Max, and that's not free software, but you can at least run max patches on a, on 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The runtime, right? Yeah. On 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="841.115" data-end_ts="841.195" title="841.115" id=c_"841.115">__The__</span>, so, I don't know. I'm trying to think what's, what, what are, what also has had the most change? You know, I've been just building a lot of different electronic musical instruments as part of my research. So every year we just integrate those in different ways. Yeah, I made like a little percussion interface that called the drum <span style="color:red" data-ts="860.095" data-end_ts="860.315" title="860.095" id=c_"860.095">__box__</span> that we debuted in a few <span style="color:red" data-ts="863.725" data-end_ts="864.075" title="863.725" id=c_"863.725">__clerk__</span> shows. What other things This year we made, I made an inter an instrument called the Feedback Trombone that kind of grew <span style="color:red" data-ts="872.965" data-end_ts="873.125" title="872.965" id=c_"872.965">__out__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="873.125" data-end_ts="873.245" title="873.125" id=c_"873.125">__a__</span> research, grew out of a research project along with a trombonist student who was also like a physics major here. And we, I wrote a piece for that included three feedback trombones along with a normal brass section. So I think we've moved a lot towards sort of more experimental instruments and just not, not taking the name laptop orchestra very, very literally. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Right. So I just kind of treat it as an experimental electronic music ensemble. Interesting. Where sometimes there's not even electronics. I mean, we've done, like pieces that are acoustic that just happened to, that's what we felt like worked best for this piece or something. Right. So I, I sort of think of it as it's, it's a, it's an excuse to get on stage and try to do something experimental, really, or like try to do something that you haven't seen done before really. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and if you think about it, yeah. It's also sort of an opportunity to work with sort of like computer programs that are by, you know, almost by definition unable to be synced. Right. Yeah. And so it's, it's a different thing than working within a, a single machine. True. Yeah. It's, it's, it's very much a different interaction model and, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="949.675" data-end_ts="949.965" title="949.675" id=c_"949.675">__yeah__</span>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="949.965" data-end_ts="950.245" title="949.965" id=c_"949.965">__Really__</span> compelling. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>I think that's the, that's the most interesting thing about it. <span style="color:red" data-ts="953.565" data-end_ts="953.685" title="953.565" id=c_"953.565">__I__</span>, I think if you'd asked me like, would you be interested in directing a laptop ensemble eight years ago before I took this job? I would say, no, <laugh>. Because the idea didn't really sound that exciting to me. Sure. Like, oh, okay, a bunch of people on computers, maybe they got a network and, you know, maybe they're typing, it looks like they're checking their email. I don't know, <laugh>. But like, really, the thing that's interesting about it is if you kind of step back from that and step back from any kind of preconceived notions you might have about what that might mean, and really think about it as, okay, we're gonna make music for people that are using electronics, and it's a matter of, oh, what if you wanted to make electronic music with more than one or two people? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Which is, you know, when you're doing it with one person, you've, you're working within one machine, or maybe you have a set of hardware or whatever, but, but you, you've got all these easy connections between software, but once you get a lot of people, the challenges get larger, but also you get musical interaction between those people that you can't have as a single person or as two people. And I think you just don't hear those types of interactions with electronic sound as much. Right. So to me, it's, that's the interesting thing is like, oh, what do you do with a bunch of people? If you all wanna make electronic music together, that's difficult, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that's also kind of a really interesting, compositional landscape because, you know, when you're talking about computer musicians, each one of these people can make all the noise, you know? Exactly. They can, they can fill up 100% of the frequency space and then some. And so finding ways, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>And they can all sound like anything or, you know, <laugh>, it's like, yeah, you don't have these, these delineated roles necessarily, and you have to work to carve out the space. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You mentioned doing some interest, instrument design as mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, that some of these <span style="color:red" data-ts="1055.245" data-end_ts="1055.465" title="1055.245" id=c_"1055.245">__is__</span> doing. And the way that we first met was you were in school, but you had made, the first version of the Manta, which is this beautiful metal surface that has a very unique touch interaction. It's hypersensitive, but very musical. It's a beautiful piece of work. And you've continued to work on that. I just got, the most recent model, which is, you said it's a rev three, right? Yep. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Yeah. Third edition. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And so it's, it, it feels different. It's, it remains beautiful. What has changed in the revs and what does, did the change, were the change required by, like, differences in parts or manufacturing or <span style="color:red" data-ts="1098.625" data-end_ts="1098.845" title="1098.625" id=c_"1098.625">__the__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1098.845" data-end_ts="1099.085" title="1098.845" id=c_"1098.845">__site__</span>? Did you just come across different ideas? What, what led to the changes? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>I think prob possibly the most striking thing about the Manta is that it's hasn't changed much in 10 years. That came out with the original one, 2008. When you think about sort of electronic musical instruments, I feel like a lot of things end up falling a little bit on that gadget spectrum of feeling like it needs to update and constantly be different in order to make the old thing, obsolete. I mean, you know, a lot of the great electronic music designers today don't do that. But if you look at, I don't know, apple devices and things like that, like the general consumer electronics has that planned obsolescence thing, right. But also, you know, and also just this idea of, oh, it's not finished. We're gonna, you know, oh, it's always gonna develop or change. And part of the Manta for me was I, I did a whole lot of iterations before I came out with the thing as a product. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>So I went through all sorts of different sensor designs and originally maybe it was gonna have a piano keyboard style thing, and now it's like a hexagon grid. And I just experimented with all different sorts of sizes of sensors and positioning of things and, you know, how many sensors are there and how big is it? And oh, originally it was like two of the things that is now called the Manta, and they were like hinged together. And, you know, it went through tons of design iterations. But then once I came out with it, I was kinda like, okay, this is the thing. I only made one major change to it since then, which is, when it originally came out, it had a single color LED behind each sensor touch sensor. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, that glowed amber. And at some point I got really kind of interested in the things that you could do by controlling with a computer, LEDs being decoupled from the touch sensor. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>You know, I definitely was influenced by the mono and going that direction right. Of with like, what can you do with sort of dynamically controllable grid lighting as an interaction paradigm. And I realized how much having a single color limited that. So I could have gone one like really far and been like, okay, well I'll make a RGB LEDs and you can get any kind of hue you want, and then I can impart all this color information. But I kind of wanted it to retain a really strong design aesthetic, and I didn't want to go too far from the aesthetic it already had. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So I added a red LED along with the hamper LEDs. And I feel like that gives it enough extra ability to impart some more information, but it really keeps it inside the design aesthetic. I wanted. It feels like it's like kind of, you know, maybe like glowing fire inside the thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Right. <laugh> and I really made no other physical obvious changes to the user. You know, I did a bunch of stuff inside in order to make the other LED traces able to go around functionally for the user. Nothing really changed. And actually in the third edition functionally for the user, almost nothing changed whatsoever. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> because I, I just, made some slight iterations to try to improve the power supply system. 'cause I realized I was kind of had some leads that were too, too thin for a certain, you know, dropped the current a little bit too much from certain computers. I see. Going over USB and some power supply things made me say, oh, I should try to try to switch this up. But there's other little tiny details that change. But those are all, mostly driven by manufacturing issues. So you asked a little bit about that. I don't know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Like one of the things I noticed is it seemed like the surface of the metal was slightly different. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah. Not a lot different. I don't know. Is it, is, is it polished different or is it Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>That's definitely something I changed. So after the first edition, the surface itself is just a printed circuit board basically used as a cosmetic and touch surface. So, it's these capacitive sensors, but really like the circuit board is the panel and all the components are on the back of the circuit board. So that means that the fabrication technique I'm using is I'm getting a normally a circuit fabricator to make this thing that becomes the final panel. Okay. And they're not used to thinking about things as cosmetic. Right. <laugh>, so like a circuit board, A PCB surface is not considered a cosmetic surface for engineering purposes. Right. So I would get them back from the, the manufacturer and they're functionally all worked, but then like some of them would have look really grubby or, you know, have sort of smears on them. You know, it was just like, and they had kind of a, a patina on them already in a way that didn't look like a new product would. Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>And originally I kind of was like, okay, that's the look of the thing. 'cause I kind of liked it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's kind of steampunky almost. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Exactly. Yeah. It's a little bit, it gives it to this sort of like, oh, it's already old. Or, you know, <laugh>. I, but then I got a lot of comments from, from people buying it, being like, this doesn't look like I'm used to a new product looking. So then I experimented a little bit to see what I could do to polish them up after I get 'em from the fabricator. And now I just use, every time I, every time I ship one out, I use a metal polish on it. I found one metal polish that doesn't smell as horrible as all the other ones. And, and I give it a bunch of elbow grease and just work on 'em now. But it adds labor to me. But I feel like it actually looks really nice when they're polished up. So I sort of wish I'd done it from the get go. 'cause it's pretty fancy looking. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, it is. It's, it's amazing. Now the other, the, the piece that that's now paired up with for me is another device that's new since we last talked, I mean, completely new. And that is a eurorack module called the Manam <span style="color:red" data-ts="1413.845" data-end_ts="1414.005" title="1413.845" id=c_"1413.845">__Meet__</span>. Now <span style="color:red" data-ts="1415.705" data-end_ts="1415.925" title="1415.705" id=c_"1415.705">__the__</span> Manam <span style="color:red" data-ts="1416.325" data-end_ts="1416.485" title="1416.325" id=c_"1416.325">__meet__</span> for a long time was sort of like the, white unicorn. Right. It was something that was talked about and imagined, and I think, I think at, at any point in time, anyone who's kind of intrigued by the manta had like a mental image of what the Manta <span style="color:red" data-ts="1433.085" data-end_ts="1433.285" title="1433.085" id=c_"1433.085">__meet__</span> could be. Yeah. And now it's real. Why don't you talk a little bit about what exactly it <span style="color:red" data-ts="1439.945" data-end_ts="1440.165" title="1439.945" id=c_"1439.945">__did__</span> does and what it can do? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>So I finally finished this thing. I've been working on the Manti <span style="color:red" data-ts="1446.405" data-end_ts="1446.605" title="1446.405" id=c_"1446.405">__eight__</span> since 2010. So it really took me like seven years to come out with it. And I wasn't working on it nonstop like I should have been, but I had a, I had another job, obviously. So the main thing about it was, I'm, I'm actually a, I'm an analog <span style="color:red" data-ts="1461.005" data-end_ts="1461.205" title="1461.005" id=c_"1461.005">__sense__</span> user, and that's, that's been my main instrument since like 2007. So pretty immediately after I made the Manta, which is originally a USB device that communicates with a computer, I was like, oh, I wonder how I can make it so this thing can talk to my modular synth. I started to working on that, but it was a little hard at the time to figure out how to get a microcontroller to act as a USB host, which is a little more difficult than just having it be a USB device. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>And I experimented a little bit with that kind of thing, and eventually I made this little thing that it's a module, you can plug the Manta into it and it'll have a lot of functionality. You can use the Manta as a keyboard and it'll come out with voltages that give you, you know, can be pitch and gate and velocity. It's got some sliders on the Manta and they'll come out as different outputs. And that was the main kind of vision of sort of what does it need to be at the minimum. Right. Was like, you should be able to plug the Manta in. You should be able to, so the Manta, each sensor sort of gives an output of how much surface area you're covering. So it's all <span style="color:red" data-ts="1519.565" data-end_ts="1519.685" title="1519.565" id=c_"1519.565">__the__</span>, it's kind of like a little keyboard, but with touch sensitive keys basically. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So I was like, okay, you should be able to plug in your Manta into your modular syn through the MANAM <span style="color:red" data-ts="1529.405" data-end_ts="1529.525" title="1529.405" id=c_"1529.405">__eight__</span>, and it should allow that information to come through in voltage control. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Right. And every version that I've developed of emanate did that, but I've just been working for a long time trying to figure out what else it should do or how what its character should be beyond that. So it ended up doing a whole lot of other things too. And maybe that's part of, part of the issue with, getting the word out about it in general. I've been like having trouble figuring out how to get people to understand what it is. Is that it, it does a lot. You can plug in the manta, it can be a keyboard, but it can also be a sequencer. So you can kind of, it turns this Manta controller into a touch sequencer where all the hexagons can be steps in the step sequence and you can touch them to activate them. You can, change parameters of each step, make it have a pitch associated with it, make it have certain slider values associated with it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>It also acts as a USB MIDI host. So you can plug in a standard MIDI keyboard into the man tomate instead of am Manta. You can plug in a joystick or a game <span style="color:red" data-ts="1590.425" data-end_ts="1590.645" title="1590.425" id=c_"1590.425">__pad__</span> into it instead of am Manta. And it'll just route those XY values and buttons out the CV outputs. You can actually use it without any device plugged in whatsoever. And it'll be a clock generator or a clock divider, or a random voltage generator or a random pattern generator. I, I built in a whole bunch of functionality that for me, makes it really handy to be sort of the center of my studio. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>I'm not sure how many other people care about it doing all those things, but, <laugh>. But for me, it's, it's been really handy to have just one 12 hp, thing that can handle, you know, you can also plug it into your computer and then it just shows up as a MIDI device and you can send MIDI from your computer to it. So it, it sort of does a lot of those things all in one, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I guess in some cases. I mean, it's, it's sort of has the, the Swiss Army knife issue. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, which is that if what you need is a bread knife, you look for the bread knife first. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Yeah. You don't look for the Swiss Army knife. Yep. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. But, the flip side of it is, well, I'll, I'll say this. Yeah. The first time I had it plugged into my system and then I plugged the manta in and the mantle lights up in this kind of keyboarding configuration. And I get, voltages coming out of those little sliders, and I get, I get octave shifts and stuff like this. It, it seems magical. It's pretty amazing because the combination is really compelling both visually as well as just the touch. Again, I've always loved the touch of the mantas anyway, but combining that with the modular system is, is particularly exciting because now all of a sudden these touch parameters, you get that like routed to like five different things and it, it sort of like makes the modular come alive. It's a lot of fun. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>I feel like it really lets you get your hand on those signals in a way that I found very difficult to do with any other way to control my modular. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. But then the other thing for me is that it's also convenient. Sometimes I just need to play in a damn line. You know, I need to play a c minor line over three octaves. And it's just inconvenient to do that with anything except a MIDI controller. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And it's really convenient to just plug in the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1727.805" data-end_ts="1728.005" title="1727.805" id=c_"1727.805">__damn__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1728.025" data-end_ts="1728.245" title="1728.025" id=c_"1728.025">__am__</span> audio MIDI controller and blurt out a line when I have to. And so while, while I recognize that it probably, your focus has always been on the mantas connection to it, it is really kind of nice to have that. I actually <laugh>, I've actually ordered, like an old Nintendo style game pad, just simply because I want to experience with that, what it's like doing with that. Now, the one thing I didn't, I haven't yet played around with is the not plugged in at all version. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Oh, yeah. Which is pretty, it's pretty fun. Interesting. Yeah. That was, that was like an afterthought basically. I added that firmware. I programmed all of that though. All of the new device functionality I programmed in a week over the summer, like right before I released it, Uhhuh, you know, maybe like a month before I actually started shipping them. And it was really just because I'd, I'd done all this other functionality and then I was like, I'd been working with it that summer and just kind of using it in as, as my main rig in my studio. And I just got frustrated that whenever I didn't want a keyboard controller or a, you know, didn't want it plugged into my computer or something, it just did nothing. So, and it was just wasting space. And I was like, huh, I kind of wish that when I didn't need a controller, it did something. Since it has all these jacks, you know, it has a bunch of outputs, has a clock input, you know, I might as well make it do something. So then I tried to think of all the fun things I could do without all, all the things you could do with 12 outputs and one digital input without any knobs or, you know, any control voltage inputs. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1816.445" data-end_ts="1816.565" title="1816.445" id=c_"1816.445">__Right__</span>. Right. It's like, what are those things? So I ended up sticking all that stuff in, and honestly, I use that, I use that function all the time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b><laugh> probably probably other people, you know, maybe there's definitely a lot of different modules that do a lot of the jobs that that, no device mode of the Manm <span style="color:red" data-ts="1833.705" data-end_ts="1833.785" title="1833.705" id=c_"1833.705">__mate__</span> does. But it's kind of nice to have them all in one device. Right. Especially the one that turned out to be really exciting to me is very simple. So I started out, I made kind of a, a thing where every time it gets a clock, it just randomly flips the outputs. Right. So it's like basically gives you 12 or technically 11 random outputs that go on and off. Okay. And every time a clock comes in they flip. Right. Right. And that's, that's the first, you know, one of the first presets. But then I kind of, I like that, but randomness, pure randomness is never that interesting. Right. It's like, you know, you get a bunch of random values and you can get that really classic, you know, kind of random patterns, but it's not really interesting until it repeats in some way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Right. So I set up a sort of repeating randomized thing where every time you boot it up, it generates a pattern of a certain length of random on offs for every output. And then it loops those in that, in that pattern length. Right. That's just super fun. 'cause now it's like, okay, you got 11 little outputs, you can plug one into a snare drum, you know, make one control, sort of a base drum thing. One control hi-hat. And then you've got a really cool little randomized beat that actually loops. And then I have controls that light you set, how long is that loop length? So you can make it 32 steps or you can make it 16 or seven or whatever. I just, I just <span style="color:red" data-ts="1913.225" data-end_ts="1913.425" title="1913.225" id=c_"1913.225">__mess__</span> with that for hours. It's super fun. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1916.725" data-end_ts="1916.945" title="1916.725" id=c_"1916.725">__See__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1916.945" data-end_ts="1917.145" title="1916.945" id=c_"1916.945">__now__</span>, now you've given me another thing to waste a night on. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1920.025" data-end_ts="1920.145" title="1920.025" id=c_"1920.025">__I__</span> can't wait. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>You gotta, you gotta check it out. It's really fun. The thing that really pushed that over the top for me was I, I set up a little, I was like, okay, this is cool, but I don't wanna have to turn it off and on every time I wanna randomize. Right. So I put a little button press that lets you randomize it, but then I made another one that's called Subtle Randomize, which just kind of nudges it a little bit and changes some, some things. Sure. And that's really fun too. So it's like you can just basically make a drum beat and then be like, no, let's change that a little and then just keep it kind of inching around and Oh, now the snare drums like a 16th note earlier and this one <span style="color:red" data-ts="1953.065" data-end_ts="1953.225" title="1953.065" id=c_"1953.065">__bite__</span> on this one beat. Or, you know, it's really great, especially for, for rhythmic patterns. I've just found it to be really, really exciting. But I found that really interesting that that came out of it because really that was never in any of my design plans for this thing. And I've been working on it for, as I said, like eight years. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> Well, you know, it, it, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>I never said, oh, it needs to do this, you know, <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1974.245" data-end_ts="1974.325" title="1974.245" id=c_"1974.245">__mean__</span>, you, you mentioned Mono. One of the things that I, I also find interesting, both with what you've done with the math <span style="color:red" data-ts="1981.605" data-end_ts="1981.885" title="1981.605" id=c_"1981.605">__mate__</span> and what Brian Crabtree's done with the mono modules is this idea that you started off with a surface and then only later put together the hardware that would run an application That, and I'm wondering how hard is it to, to say or to go through the process of saying, I'm gonna take this thing that is limitless 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Yeah. And make it limited in 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>A way and make it limited in some way. Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b><affirmative> it was super hard and that's why it didn't come out with it for so long. So I, I should send you a image of the first, the sort of the first really developed Man Tomate prototype. It's got all these knobs on it and it has a, an internal synthesizer that I designed <laugh> that lets you, like, it's got like an internal digital synthesizer with envelopes. It had an ethernet jack so that you could communicate with it over OSC messages on a network. It's like, yeah. It had all kinds of crazy stuff because I just couldn't figure out what to cut out. Right. And I couldn't figure out what to not let the person do because when you plug it into a computer, you can write some software in Mac, you can write something in superly, you kind of make it do whatever you want. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Right. But yeah, with the modular, you can't do that. And I didn't, one step I could've done is I could've said, oh, I'm gonna make some kind of interface that lets you program your own thing and then load that on. But that was a whole barrel of, of worms that I did not wanna jump into. So I was like, okay, I'm gonna have to decide what I let them do. And it was torture for me to figure that out. I think one way that Brian solved it really well was that he came out with several different modules that had different functionality for the mono. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, that's absolutely true. And, and then with the teletype, you can kind of like connect them together and have 'em talk <span style="color:red" data-ts="2087.015" data-end_ts="2087.235" title="2087.015" id=c_"2087.015">__to__</span> each other a little bit too. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Yeah. I, I feel like he just, and really I remember, you know, Brian and I were both kind of working on this project at the same time of trying to make our devices talk to a modular synth or our USB devices talk to a modular synth. And he definitely, he beat me to it by a couple years. But, I was, I was very influenced by what he ended up doing. 'cause I was like, oh, this is really smart. And really, when I saw how limited he was able to make it and still have it be so exciting, that's when I was like, oh, okay, I can really do this. You know, people aren't going to expect it to be able to do whatever they want. They want it to be a cool sequencer. They want it to be a cool keyboard. Right. Yeah. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, once I could accept that, then development moved a lot faster. And then I was like, okay, now I just have to get the cool keyboard and the cool sequencer to work, which took me longer than I expected, but still 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> it 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Worked out. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2144.045" data-end_ts="2144.285" title="2144.045" id=c_"2144.045">__Yeah__</span>. Well, it's, it, it is a lot of, it is a lot of fun. And, and again, I, it has this kind of magical field to it. And, and look, I mean, again, when it lights up, it's pretty spectacular. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>It's funny, the, the way that it lights up is definitely the thing that makes it the most pain in the ass from a, a manufacturing perspective. <laugh>, because it's like, you know, the LEDs are actually glowing through the circuit board material, but then the circuit board material has to be a special kind that doesn't have, that won't block the light. And, you know, there's just no circuit board material manufacturers do not specify Oh, opacity. Right. For that opacity. Right. You know, it's just, there's all these, you know, all these visual things that I, I really cared about the look of that became, make it so much more complicated than if I had just done an aluminum panel or something. But sure. That's, but I think I really, I'm, I'm happy I did it though. I still feel like it, the design looks beautiful, but it's also, it's meant that I've gone with a different circuit fabricator for all three different additions too, because, you know, the first time, oh, now that material's gone out of manufacture and oh, now I have to find another one. And then, oh, this other place doesn't wanna, won't do blind visas anymore. You know, just all these different things. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Given that, do you have anything El else in the works 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>I'm working on, I've got another project. Basically, the ones that are likely to come out in less than eight years are the ones that I've already been working on for four years, <laugh>. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>I've had a project in the works for a long time called the Burl, which, you can find some pictures of on my website too. It's still quite a ways from being released, but it comes out of, it's like my attempt to make a wind controller. So I end up, I make a whole lot of instruments. So there's actually a bunch of kind of one-off instruments that I've made for my own music that I've got all over the place <span style="color:red" data-ts="2248.975" data-end_ts="2249.195" title="2248.975" id=c_"2248.975">__on__</span> like shelves and things. But most of them, there's just no way that they could become a commercial product because they would cost too much to manufacture in quantity, or they just involve too much labor or Sure. They're just too weird and nobody would ever want them <laugh>. But I started working on a wind instrument for my ensemble of invented instruments that I kind of conceived this whole project as Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>And I was like, oh, we need a wind instrument. And that's, my wind instrument has always been called the burl. And it just sort of goes, it's gone through tons and tons of changes over the years. And that's another one. I, I built the first version in 2009, I think, and it's just changed a lot now. It's basically a wind controller, but it's also intended to work with the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2292.675" data-end_ts="2292.835" title="2292.675" id=c_"2292.675">__man__</span> tomate. So I've been designing it so that it's a wind controller, you can also easily plug into your modular. And it has a built <span style="color:red" data-ts="2298.435" data-end_ts="2298.635" title="2298.435" id=c_"2298.435">__in__</span> synthesizer thing, which I've been working quite a bit onto in a lot of ways. It's very similar to existing wind controllers. So it's a little hard to figure out how best to explain what's different about it. I kind of feel like a lot of my work ends up being sort of, it's like subtly there's something very subtle that makes it very different, but it's like, how do I get that across the wind instrument? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>One thing that's that's very different about it is, existing commercial products tend to have, the holes on a, on the wind instrument are kind of like keys where, where they're digital on off, and it'll try to figure out what note trying to play by. Look at the, by looking at the binary number that is made up of your button presses. Right. Right. So it's like, you know, your holes are either open or closed. But then there's a lot of wind instruments in the real world that, where that's not the case. And there's a continuous variation in, in how open or closed a hole could be. Right. So think of the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2352.065" data-end_ts="2352.285" title="2352.065" id=c_"2352.065">__ur__</span>, you know, Indian bamboo flute or <span style="color:red" data-ts="2356.285" data-end_ts="2356.605" title="2356.285" id=c_"2356.285">__Chennai__</span>, you know, double <span style="color:red" data-ts="2358.685" data-end_ts="2358.965" title="2358.685" id=c_"2358.685">__read__</span> instrument. There's all sorts of, instruments with just straight up open holes where bending the pitches using those open holes is a big part of the playing technique. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Right. And I wanted to try to make that possible. So I've developed this wind instrument that has, it's using capacitive touch sensing technology, much like the manta, but there's sort of a mapping issue of how do you actually make it so that rolling your pinky off of that thing will actually bring you to the note you want and bend correctly. That's sort of more complex. So I've been working quite a bit on that, on that side of things. And right now it's, it uses this, machine learning kind of neural net approach. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> where you can train it by saying, okay, when I do this fingering, I want it to be this note. When I do this fingering, I want it to be this note. Right. And then you can say, okay, figure it out. And then it goes and tries to figure out what it's gonna do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>And then now you can play all sorts of patterns that you didn't train it on and it'll try to make something up for those. Right. Wow. And that's kind of really interesting to me. 'cause what I feel like is really missing from, conventional wind controllers is like, if they look at your finger patterns and say, look, and check it against the lookup table and say, okay, does this match something I know, you know, existing things like the UE or the, or the, Yamaha WX series or something. Right. They'll, if they don't know it, then the note doesn't change. Right. But in a real <span style="color:red" data-ts="2438.855" data-end_ts="2439.055" title="2438.855" id=c_"2438.855">__win__</span> instrument, if you play like one fingering and then you move some finger that's not supposed to be a traditional fingering, maybe it gives you a slightly flat version of that original note. You know, maybe it gives you a multiphonic, maybe it gives you some kind of crazy thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Right. Right. And I kind of really like the idea that there's this huge space and there's, you know, people's entire, some people's whole playing technique comes out of that. Right. You listen to Evan Parker, it's like his whole technique comes out of finding these weird places that are kind of un undiscovered on the saxophone and just, you know, figuring out where they are and how to get them right. And I kind of wanted to make a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2474.495" data-end_ts="2474.695" title="2474.495" id=c_"2474.495">__win__</span> instrument that had that depth in it. So that's the way I'm trying to approach it right now is do this kind of training system so that it ends up filling all the latent possible space Right. With potential things, which could be pitches, could also be Tamil Right, too. Yeah. So you can train on multiple parameters. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I was wondering too, how dynamic of a system is this? I mean, can you, is is it gonna lend itself to experimentation? Like you, you make like really poor, you know, you train it in sort of like a poor waste specifically to see what kind of ridiculousness it might produce? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Yeah. I mean that's, that's a major concept of what, how a use case of how somebody might use it. I think so, you know, it's basically totally dynamic. You just say right now, you can't do it on the instrument yourself. You have to plug the instrument into a computer, and then there's a little interface where you say, I'm gonna train and then this is what I'm gonna do and it's gonna give this output or something. Right. But you can just keep doing that over and over again, and then you can save the stuff. And what I'm working on right now is that then you just load those trained, systems into the instrument itself and then that remembers them. But, you know, the process is so easy that it's just like you could experiment a hundred times and find all sorts of different things you can do, which makes me very excited. I don't know how many wind instrument players will care about it. You know, we'll see. It's a wacky idea that hopefully people will be excited about. But that's likely gonna be the next Snyder phonics product is as soon as I solve a few of the remaining technical problems and figure out how to do some things that I'm finding difficult for manufacturing things, if I can figure out how to do those smoother, then I wanna come out with it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's interesting because I, I interviewed Nile Steiner a little while ago Yeah. About the development of the iwi and, and it was interesting how the creation of that sort of led to there being people for whom that was their instrument. That was the expression. Yeah. You know, and this seems like this has the ability to do that to literally become the tool, you know, the instrument for someone who becomes adept with it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Actually Niel Steiner's a really huge influence on me in a lot of ways, not just, with the EWI and the EVI, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2611.245" data-end_ts="2611.405" title="2611.245" id=c_"2611.245">__UE__</span> and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2611.725" data-end_ts="2611.885" title="2611.725" id=c_"2611.725">__UV__</span> also his, his cinon. And I don't know, he, he's a really interesting designer. So I've been, I've been excited about his work for a while. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, I, I would have to say that one of the things that interests me is, is the way that he always found a way to make things organic, even at a time when it seemed kind of improbable with the technology available. You know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Totally. Yeah. And I mean, I don't know, you look at the original, you look at the original, the ev, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And it's like, I know, you know, those original prototypes are cooler than what a Kai came out with <laugh>. So, I mean, <laugh>, it's kinda like, you know, they, they were <span style="color:red" data-ts="2649.245" data-end_ts="2649.405" title="2649.245" id=c_"2649.245">__do__</span>, they eliminated a few things. And I mean, also those original things were, were synthesizers in themselves, not just controllers. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>In a way that I find really exciting because they had their own voice, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, indeed. They're truly instruments. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Yeah. Which is kind of a, it's a real problem I have sometimes in my own development of I want to make, I have the goal that I wanna make instruments, and ideally I'd like to make things that actually sound like, have identifiable sounds where you can listen to a recording and be like, oh, it's that thing. Right. Yeah. Everything I've released so far is actually a little more, you know, the mantas a controller. Right. It doesn't sound like anything. So I don't know how I can, I need to actually release some of my more instrument stuff, but it, you know, every, I don't know. I'm not living up to my, my goal in some ways <laugh>. So it's like, I don't know. I want, I feel like an electronic musical instrument should be self-contained and should have its own sound and should have a lot of constraints and limitations that make it the way that an acoustic instrument does. But it's so hard to hold to those, those ideals. I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Hear you. Now the other thing I know just from some earlier discussions we have, the, the other thing I know that you're playing around with is, is with, some VCV RAC development. Yeah. We've had a lot of VCV RAC activity here on the podcast and, in my, in my studio as well. It's a pretty amazing platform. What do you, what do you got going there? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>I'm super excited about VCV RE stuff. I've seen a few different attempts to do that, like make a modular in the software thing. And I think it's really hard to do well. And I feel like VCV Rex really pulled it off well, where it really feels like it interacts, you know, modules interact in a really realistic, interesting way. You can do feedback, you can do all <span style="color:red" data-ts="2765.915" data-end_ts="2766.115" title="2765.915" id=c_"2765.915">__sides__</span>, all sorts of crazy things that I think of as being limitations of the software outside of a modular system. And it has the, of course, the amazing plus side that you don't have to spend $300 anytime you want. Right. Another functionality, right. <laugh>, oh, now I want two oscillators. Ah, crap. So, you can just click and add one, but also, like, looking into it, the, the development kit is, is really not too hard to get into. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>So I've been working with a little team over here. I've got a researcher named Mike Sine who works with me and, a couple undergraduate students at Princeton who are in the engineering program who've gotten excited about this too. And we're kind of working together to try to make a few a set of VC v res modules. One thing we wanna do is we wanna port the man Tomate to <span style="color:red" data-ts="2812.075" data-end_ts="2812.235" title="2812.075" id=c_"2812.075">__VC__</span> v res, which we think would be really cool just 'cause it does a whole bunch of interesting things. It in some ways, you know, it doesn't make as much sense. It's like, okay, am Manta already talks to a computer, you know, now VCV racks would live in the computer anyway. But I feel like making it so that you could control the kind of things in VVC v racks with a physical controller of the Manto would be really exciting, I think. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Right. So I wanna do that. Also, I feel like right now it's, it's a pretty open, it's a pretty open market where there's not a whole lot of people who've finished things for it yet, but there's a lot of people using it. So when I go on there and look around for, I just want more VCV Rex modules for what I've been doing with it. So I wanna fill that need a bit. So we're working on emanate port, but we're also kind of working on a few really crazy ones trying to decide how to come out with these. One of 'em is basically ready and we're gonna release it in a few weeks. It's, I don't know exactly what it'll be called, probably squid axon or something. 'cause it's basically, I've been working a lot on trying to do synthesis using methods that are not intended to be audio synthesis methods, if that makes some sense. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>If you've heard of physical modeling synthesis, which I know you have Darwin, right. Physical modeling synthesis is sort of like you take a model of how a physical system works and you have some equation that describes that physical system and you set up your digital system to replicate that and create the output that it would create given certain, a certain state that it's in. For instance, it would vibrate the way that a string would vibrate and tell you where if you watched one part of the string, what would the deflection from the center point be? Right. I don't <span style="color:red" data-ts="2916.565" data-end_ts="2916.645" title="2916.565" id=c_"2916.565">__know__</span>, probably, that's not the simplest way to describe it, but there you go. But there's models of other things that are not acoustic. Things like, you know, like a drum or a string. Science uses models for all kinds of behaviors. So one thing I found kind of interesting, there was a student, in the electrical engineering department here who was telling me about how he's working on these, models of how a neuron fires Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b><affirmative> in his lab. And he was showing me how it worked. And we were both like, oh, I wonder what this would sound like <laugh>, you know, because basically neurons spike, and there's, there's different kind of inputs that they can have. And then in these models, these models of how a neuron works electrically, you know, certain input configurations will make them just kind of spike and then go down. Right. And other inputs will make them oscillate where they'll, you know, spike repeatedly. And then how complicated the model is like how realistic it is in certain ways will kind of determine how that waveform works. And we got really excited about this. So we tried to, prototype something up so that we could test it out and we got it to make sound pretty immediately, which was amazing. Then we kind of developed that a little bit and I came out with this model that is basically just like a little digital synthesis model of a, of a neuron firing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>And then the parameters, the input parameters for it are all the physical properties of what makes neurons fire. So it's the membrane voltage is the output and you've got a sodium channel activation and sodium channel, inactivation and potassium channel, things like that, that are your actual input parameters. Okay. Which mean absolutely nothing to us as musicians. Right, right. So, and I find it really interesting actually, if those are your input parameters and then the model responds to them in some way, like how do you make music with it? And I find that to be kind of an interesting problem. So last year with laptop orchestra, we did a piece where this was the instrument that everyone had. And at the time we just, we just took a little, a <span style="color:red" data-ts="3033.285" data-end_ts="3033.485" title="3033.285" id=c_"3033.285">__kai__</span> controller with some knobs and there were eight parameters. So we gave eight knobs. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Right. Okay. And then we all tried to learn how to play it. You can't play particular notes. You know, you, it, it can get different. You can kind of figure out, okay, this knob sort of makes it go higher. This knob kind of interacts with this other knob and it's basically like a Lopez filter, but it also makes it go flat. You know, there were all these kind of interrelated effects of it, which I found really interesting, where it's not like this is the filter cutoff. It's like this thing makes it noisier and makes it higher frequency or something, you know? And it was really interesting to work with an instrument where the, the input parameters really weren't obvious or weren't kind of musically sensical. Right. So anyway, we wanted to try to see what, what would happen if we turned that into a VCV rack thing. So we made it and it's really fun. You can kind of like, and you can even, you know, feed the inputs back into the outputs and stuff and it just makes this crazy noisy screamy sound <laugh>. So we're hopefully gonna release that. I'm just a little worried that maybe it'll scare everybody away from Snyder Phonics VCV Rex modules. 'cause it'll be like, you know, oh, okay. They make the totally weird, crazy stuff that I can't understand, but no one understands it. It makes no sense. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's the point. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Exactly. It's the 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Plan <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>Exactly. So, you know, but that one's really exciting. So we, we developed that code and then we've been kind of working a little bit on, on developing a base of code in this language called Oops, that we wrote here at Princeton. It's not a language, it's a, it's more an audio library, written in c and we've been trying to figure out, okay, let's, like, so we made this neuron thing as a VST plugin, actually that's how we used it in PL and then now we've made it as a vs. VVC V racks thing. But we're also kind of working on making a little kind of a workflow where we can develop for a VCV racks and also developed for hardware as well. 'cause we've got kind of these little digital brains that I made for, modular synthesis digital audio boards. We've been working on kind of translating it to the same. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>So I could also make just a little neuron hardware <span style="color:red" data-ts="3150.765" data-end_ts="3151.005" title="3150.765" id=c_"3150.765">__sense__</span> thing. Sure. I don't know if I'll ever come out with those as products 'cause I don't know what the demand would be, but I guess people like crazy sounds and modular synthesis. But, but it's been really fun. It's, it's kind of neat to be able to simultaneously develop for both of those things. Right. So that's been really exciting to us and I feel like that really wasn't, would not have been easy like four years ago or three years ago at all. You know, I mean, VVC V Rex didn't exist back then, but even, you know, we're also using the juice platform for a lot of things and it's just that, that makes things developing software for vsts and stuff like that just so much easier. I'm really grateful for their development work. Yeah. It's, it's an awesome platform to use. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Jeff, man, we blew through an hour in an eye blink. It's fascinating, just diving into your brain and, and also hearing, hearing all these different directions it seems like, I don't know, man, it, it seems like you've got, you've got electricity by the tail here a little bit. Sounds fascinating. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jeff: </b>I'm having fun of this 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Yeah, I well I'm gonna have to get out there and visit you, see what, see what you got going in your, in your crazy laboratory at some point.
