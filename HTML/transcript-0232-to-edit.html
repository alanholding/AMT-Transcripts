<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today I have the great pleasure of talking to someone who is just highly recommended by, a couple of the people I know. His name is Wayne Pete. He is a jazz musician, but also a widely known, recording engineer. A lot of people that I know have, worked with him or worked in groups that were recorded by him. He's done a lot of work with Jeff Kaiser. He, Andrew passed raves about him as being like the, his favorite engineer he's ever worked with. So that was just, that was more than enough recommendation for me. <laugh>, I'm really anxious to talk to Wayne, so let's kick right into it. Hey, Wayne, how's it going? Pretty good. Thank you so much for taking the time to have a chat with me. I really appreciate it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne Peet: </b>Yeah. Well, my pleasure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, let's start off by hearing a little bit about what you've got going on right now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b>Well, as usual, I'm juggle a lot of things to make a living between playing keyboards and, and engineering. I, I have some regular church gigs that I do as well as concerts with various people <span style="color:red" data-ts="80.065" data-end_ts="80.285" title="80.065" id=c_"80.065">__at__</span>, in a week or so, I'm, I'm playing with Roberto Miranda's group, the bass player Yeah. From LA who was also my first record credit. He invited me onto one of his, records back in the late seventies. He's put together a group more recently, which we recorded at my studio. And I'm also in the process of now editing and mixing that session. So that's one thing that's going on there. I have a number of clients from amateurs to professionals to <laugh> real artists to wannabes, you know, as anybody with a studio usually ends up with. So I've got a few of those things going on as well. It, and being freelance, it always, when I look out two months, I usually have nothing in the calendar, but when I'm, when I'm actually down to it, I'm working 16 hours a day for months, so, Right. Can't complain. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. It's interesting you say that because, you know, I, I do some writing for Recording Magazine, which is really oriented towards novice and upcoming recording engineers and stuff. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I think the perception of what being a running a studio is like, and especially being an independent engineer is like, I think it's really different than what a lot of people assume. I I think that they don't really kind of understand the terror of two weeks out, always looking like, you know, a cliff <laugh> that you're gonna jump off of. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b>Yeah. Well, I mean, and it's different now too, you know, with the demise of so many commercial studios, you know, and I've been able to, since I have my studio's converted garage, like that's morphed into parts of my house and other buildings on the property, <span style="color:red" data-ts="184.225" data-end_ts="184.445" title="184.225" id=c_"184.225">__or__</span>, I've been insulated a little bit from having to make 'em a monthly nut on also a commercial space, commercial 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Site. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b>So I just have to make the nut of my mortgage, which, you know, 'cause I've had the opportunity a couple of times where people wanted me to, you know, and I, I would've kind of liked to <span style="color:red" data-ts="204.245" data-end_ts="204.445" title="204.245" id=c_"204.245">__have__</span> more space. But in the long run, just the economic security of not having to worry about that as much and dealing with the space issues and, and working at home in LA where you don't have to, you know, drive, you know, for three hours to get 20 miles <laugh>. It is kind of cool. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. It's funny you say that. 'cause I have to admit, the one commonality of everyone I know from LA is that somehow traffic and driving gets wedged into a conversation. <laugh>, it is like, well, it's like the bloodline of life <span style="color:red" data-ts="239.255" data-end_ts="239.605" title="239.255" id=c_"239.255">__there__</span>. It's Yeah, indeed. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b>And my commute is like down my stairs into my studio, so can't Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's <span style="color:red" data-ts="245.805" data-end_ts="245.885" title="245.805" id=c_"245.805">__all__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b>Perfect. Right? Yeah. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So one of the things I like doing in a podcast, so I like to talk to people about their background and how they got into, into their gig. Now I got an opportunity to read a little about you, particularly the, the writeup on you in tape <span style="color:red" data-ts="262.345" data-end_ts="262.565" title="262.345" id=c_"262.345">__hop__</span>. And it was really fascinating. Kind of hear about it. I'd like to hear maybe a little more depth <span style="color:red" data-ts="267.065" data-end_ts="267.285" title="267.065" id=c_"267.065">__of__</span> that, kind of how you got started in music and then how that morphed into the recording world. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b>Yeah. It, it, it was kind of a morph because I didn't really intend to become an engineer. I did intend to become a musician. Having read your background blog, I, I grew up in a similar kind of circumstance in conservative Christian Church environment. My dad was a minister in smaller towns. I mean, he moved periodically. So I had some larger towns, but high school was in Imperial Valley, which was a town imperial in that place, which was 3000 people. So pretty small town. You know, I took piano lessons from when I was a kid, played in church. I also played trombone as well as piano up through college. And just was interested in music. In my senior year of, of high school. I just decided I wanted to pursue music and not as a teacher Right. But as a performer, because it seemed kind <span style="color:red" data-ts="329.525" data-end_ts="329.605" title="329.525" id=c_"329.525">__of__</span>, I mean, I really respect great music teachers, but I just wasn't feeling that <laugh>. And there's also plenty of people that teaching is somehow a second choice, you know? Right. Because they couldn't make it <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Teaching as Plan B never really seems to be that great <span style="color:red" data-ts="344.645" data-end_ts="344.925" title="344.645" id=c_"344.645">__about__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b>Yeah. And does no respect to great teachers. 'cause I've had some great, really great teachers and those are the people that should be teaching <laugh>. Right, right. So anyway, I had a lot of support at home. My dad was a much more intellectual type of person than the, the usual conservative Christian people, especially that people expect nowadays. Right. <laugh>. Right. Because it's kind of morphed into a hate group. Yeah. <laugh>. But, not when I grew up, it was more like, just kind of a more isolation, kind of doing their own thing type of vibe. Not as political as it is now. And, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="387.685" data-end_ts="387.885" title="387.685" id=c_"387.685">__it__</span>, there was plenty of stupid stuff to rebel against. But I never really pursued music in any kind of rebellious way. I was just curious about it. Interesting. And my parents were, respectful of that. And I used to try to, you know, share stuff with them, have them listen to the stuff I was listening to and whatnot. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b>Yeah. And one of the big changes for me was in high school, like just having kind of a spiritual experience listening to some really loud rock music on my stereo that wasn't Christian. You know, it was like secular. And, and at that point I realized there was no sacred secular divide. It was just music. Right. You know, it was a big breakthrough for me. And then I went to college and, majored in music at, Westmont College in Santa Barbara, which was a Christian liberal arts college, but it was more academic than some of the other choices in religious schools where their, their music major would be like a church music major. Right. As opposed <span style="color:red" data-ts="449.485" data-end_ts="449.645" title="449.485" id=c_"449.485">__hostage__</span> music major. And at that, that was also a fairly small school. And one of the things that was great about that is I met a bunch of people that ended up becoming co longtime colleagues and there was a whole little movement of artists, poets, and musicians that kind of coalesced around this one art teacher there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b>We, formed this group called the Osher Hall Art Ensemble because at that point some of us were really into the art ensemble of Chicago and Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> some of that stuff. And it combined with people that were all also interested in more straight ahead kind of jazz. And we kinda morphed that into this group that kind of encompassed everything from standards to free improvisation. That was kind of like the most important part of my college thing more than the academics, because like the head of the music department would make some really stupid comments about jazz. And at one point I gave him a listening list to counter the listening list that he was giving me of classical music, just 'cause he had really no idea about jazz. Right. Anyway, that was kind of, and so how I got into recording was during college I got a TX four track, 33 40 s just to record my own stuff and started doing that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b>And as you probably know, that has Simulink and you can do overdubs and stuff. Yeah. So it was a combination of recording live events with either two or four mics. And also doing, you know, starting to work with like overdub type of projects. So it started just myself. Then when I ended up moving to la like year out outta college, and I've been here ever since. I had a piano that I bought and put in my, living room in the house I was sharing with my brother. And that became my first kind of studio. The big breakthrough for me was when dads came out because you could actually do completely professional record quality stuff, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="585.255" data-end_ts="585.605" title="585.255" id=c_"585.255">__Final__</span> product. Yeah. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b>Yeah. I found out that I could do that and make money to buy more gear <laugh> to by hiring out. So that was the next step in kind of moving in. <span style="color:red" data-ts="598.585" data-end_ts="598.805" title="598.585" id=c_"598.585">__The__</span>, my advantage was a lot of jazz musicians had <span style="color:red" data-ts="601.445" data-end_ts="601.685" title="601.445" id=c_"601.445">__gone__</span>, would go to rock and roll studios that they could afford, and the engineer wouldn't have any idea how to deal with that music. 'cause they were used to doing rock and roll. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So, you know, first clue is when you walk in with an upright bass and <span style="color:red" data-ts="615.005" data-end_ts="615.085" title="615.005" id=c_"615.005">__the__</span> guy calls it a cello, you know, you're dead <laugh>. But I knew the music, so, since it was live to dad, you had to mix it on the fly. You know, you had to know where the solos were coming. Right. You know, when the head was gonna come, you know, that kind of stuff. And I was aware of that kind of stuff. So I had an advantage that way. So I could, when I did these first <span style="color:red" data-ts="638.515" data-end_ts="638.805" title="638.515" id=c_"638.515">__jazz__</span>, you know, live mix stuff that I did to dad, they would turn out better than somebody that didn't understand the music trying to do it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So was that like, because I mean, were you like reading charts with them? Or was it just because you were kind of tuned into kind of body language these people were playing with? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b>I guess both. You know, and just, I mean, when, you know, Ja you just ask them too, you know. I see. They're gonna, I mean, if it's a typical jazz tune, it's gonna have an in <span style="color:red" data-ts="667.005" data-end_ts="667.245" title="667.005" id=c_"667.005">__head__</span> and an out <span style="color:red" data-ts="667.685" data-end_ts="667.925" title="667.685" id=c_"667.685">__head__</span> and then solos in the middle. Right, right. You know, so you'll ask him like, what's the order of solos? Got it. Right. Like, okay, it's trumpet, piano, bass, and then the out <span style="color:red" data-ts="676.365" data-end_ts="676.605" title="676.365" id=c_"676.365">__head__</span>. So you're kind of waiting for like, okay, next is the piano solo, you know, so I'm gonna turn up the piano slightly. <span style="color:red" data-ts="683.985" data-end_ts="684.205" title="683.985" id=c_"683.985">__Yep__</span>. You know, and then when the base bass solo comes, you add a little reverb to the <span style="color:red" data-ts="688.085" data-end_ts="688.285" title="688.085" id=c_"688.085">__bass__</span> and turn it up, you know, and then when the out <span style="color:red" data-ts="690.605" data-end_ts="690.885" title="690.605" id=c_"690.605">__head__</span> is coming, you can kind of feel it coming if, if you, even if you don't have the chart, you know, you've heard the in <span style="color:red" data-ts="696.725" data-end_ts="696.925" title="696.725" id=c_"696.725">__head__</span>, so you kind of know basically what's gonna happen, what's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Coming. Right. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b>Yeah. So those kind of things kind of fed into me being an engineer. <span style="color:red" data-ts="706.085" data-end_ts="706.205" title="706.085" id=c_"706.085">__Hmm__</span>. I even at that point, I had used, I used a pseudonym <laugh> for my engineering. 'cause I didn't want it to cross pollinate into my music <laugh>, musician, credits. Right, right. So some of those early records, it says Pete Edwards. Oh, interesting. Which is my middle name and my last name first. But after a while, I, I realized who caress <laugh>. Right, right. It's just me. I do all this stuff and then you worry about like, oh, people think you're a jack of all trades, master of none. But I just try to be good at everything and I don't care anymore <laugh> what people think. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it seems though too, like your timing in terms of bringing your perspective to the music was, was probably pretty on the nose even without knowing it, because it was a time where all the money was flowing through rock sessions into studios. So, you know, that's, that was kind of the format there. All classical music, which was a completely different style of recording techniques, stuff that was all happening in halls there. But there wasn't really a well understood recording environment for jazz music. And so, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b>Well, especially if it wasn't big budget, you know, labels or Right. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And so by being a player and someone that would've interacted with a lot of local musicians, that probably put you in a pretty good place to say the the guys <span style="color:red" data-ts="792.585" data-end_ts="792.805" title="792.585" id=c_"792.585">__at__</span> at the Rock studio aren't gonna get it. Right. And I mean, when you hear what they try and do, it's just so tone deaf, it's really raw. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b>Yeah. Well, I mean, and they're doing stuff like, you know, using over compression and Right. Which sounds great on rock, you know. Yeah. But if, if you're, you're trying to move to a kind of faux natural thing with, you know, both classical and jazz and, which doesn't mean that you don't do studio trickery. It just means that you don't want to hear it Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="824.825" data-end_ts="825.045" title="824.825" id=c_"824.825">__As__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="825.075" data-end_ts="825.365" title="825.075" id=c_"825.075">__that__</span>, you know. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's funny you say that because I had a, a good friend who had a jazz and ens novelle that had, you know, he spent a pile of money to, to get a recording done. And he, he seemed to be pretty proud of it. And he came and had me listen to it, and it sounded like the whole band was being squeezed through a toothpaste tube. The, the compression was so heavy duty. And you know what, an upright base does not sound good when it's heavily, <span style="color:red" data-ts="852.025" data-end_ts="852.245" title="852.025" id=c_"852.025">__it__</span> just doesn't, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b>And especially if you're not, if you're trying for a naturalistic sound. Yeah. Right. For sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And the same with like, a jazz ride, it, the, the whole, it even seems like the timing changes because you don't have the natural 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b>Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="867.045" data-end_ts="867.085" title="867.045" id=c_"867.045">__Because__</span> the whoosh becomes louder than the attack. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Exactly. <laugh>, and it's really, it's really weird. So I can, I can see where your sensitivity to what the music should sound like ended up being a really valuable thing for these players. Now, one of the things I notice when I look at the discography of what you've been involved in is it, it actually sort of matches this, the band that you were, you were involved with at Westmont, where it seems like it ranges kind of from standard jazz. I know it's like Kenny <span style="color:red" data-ts="897.405" data-end_ts="897.885" title="897.405" id=c_"897.405">__Burrell__</span> is like one of the people <span style="color:red" data-ts="899.205" data-end_ts="899.405" title="899.205" id=c_"899.205">__who__</span> record and stuff, and I think of him as kinda like one of the, the classic standards guys, right. But going all the way through people like Nels Klein, which is, some of this stuff can be jazzy, but some of the stuff that you actually recorded was really on the <span style="color:red" data-ts="916.315" data-end_ts="916.805" title="916.315" id=c_"916.315">__aggress__</span>, almost aggressive avant-garde side. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b>Sure. Well, I mean, one of the advantages of people my age, I think is that, there's less, you know, who are associated with jazz anyway. There's less of the angry jazz guy of people that were a little older than <laugh>, than us, you know, who really hated rock because, you know, in the sixties, you know, some kid with a guitar could like learn guitar in a week and then do something in his garage and become famous. Whereas these guys had worked their whole life to, you know, become these virtuosos and now they couldn't get any work. Right. So there was a lot of animosity about that. Right. You know, but people my age, like grew up listening to a lot of stuff, and we <span style="color:red" data-ts="963.885" data-end_ts="964.085" title="963.885" id=c_"963.885">__did__</span> really weren't prejudiced against certain types of music and, and just enjoyed rock and jazz. You know, it's just like different kinds of good music <laugh>. Right. So there's no big divide for me in that regard, you know? So, I mean, I've done everything including in my playing from just complete noise free <span style="color:red" data-ts="984.905" data-end_ts="985.125" title="984.905" id=c_"984.905">__for__</span> all stuff to very conservative standard stuff, or classical or whatever, to hip hop to just tons of different stuff, world music. And it's just, to me, it's, it isn't a division there, you know? But I did get kind of known as doing jazz, you know, live <span style="color:red" data-ts="1004.725" data-end_ts="1004.885" title="1004.725" id=c_"1004.725">__music__</span> got 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>A reputation for that. Right? Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, do you find that, that you have to like, tweak your techniques or your ear or anything, in order to match the kind of music you work? Or do you kind of assume that if people are coming to you, they understand what they're going to get and they're, they're looking for your ear as it is 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b>A little combination? You know, I mean, of course there's different kind of aesthetics that you don't wanna bring a classical aesthetic to a, to a hip hop thing necessarily. You know, it's kind of not that it wouldn't work. Totally. There's certain kind of overarching principles that will help. Like one of my pet peeves is just good mic placement, which doesn't mean that you spend a week getting a snare sound, but it, it is just, I have to mix stuff that people bring to me. And it's, it's appalling sometimes. Like what I mean, how people can't point a mic at something that they wanna record, which to me doesn't seem that hard <laugh>. Right. But I've, I've had stuff from major studios like <span style="color:red" data-ts="1076.765" data-end_ts="1077.205" title="1076.765" id=c_"1076.765">__Capital__</span> and Westlake and stuff that just sound like crap, you know, and they've got really good gear. So it's, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And really good monitoring facilities, you'd think they'd be able to hear the problem. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b>It's just knowledge and, and listening. Yeah. I think, you know, or caring, you know, because the number one <laugh>, the number one, you know, qua, you know, requirement I think in engineering, whether it's for pa you know, live stuff or, or in the studios to give a shit <laugh>. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b>And, you gotta really care about trying to make it good, you know, even if it's something you go like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1118.905" data-end_ts="1119.125" title="1118.905" id=c_"1118.905">__ah__</span>, you know, not really into this, but your, you know, your job is to try to make it as good as you can make it, you know, and there's a surprising amount of people that don't care, right. And are the job, you know, it's just getting through the session, oh, this is bullshit. You know, you know, and it shows up and it, you know, that kind of attitude never helps anybody and it'll hurt the engineer worse than anybody else. I think, you know, I I I've never understood that It's like, if you're gonna do it, you might as well do it. You know, do it right or do it as best you can. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, I, I don't understand how those people can especially fulfill the role of recording engineer. I think if you're a producer, you could just say, well, I'm not any good at producing hip hop, for example, so I'm not gonna take those gigs. Where <span style="color:red" data-ts="1166.885" data-end_ts="1167.125" title="1166.885" id=c_"1166.885">__with__</span> being a recording engineer, it's more like you have to, you have to be able to sort of chameleon yourself to be supportive in whatever role the artist needs, but also to really focus on great sound. And I think if you can get to the point where you don't care if it sounds good or not, it seems like you either need to find another job or kick yourself upstairs to be a producer and, don't mess up other people's work.

<b>Wayne: </b>Well, I've been lucky too, since I, I don't have like a commercial facility that's advertised, you know, or whatever. It's all word of mouth. So, you know, I've <span style="color:red" data-ts="1203.805" data-end_ts="1204.045" title="1203.805" id=c_"1203.805">__known__</span> people that have had commercial studios and, you know, the people that call up out of the phone book, you know, when they had phone books, you know, you would end up with some pretty wacky clients. Yeah. You know, and, and I have been shielded from a lot of that just because it's all word of mouth recommendations. Still a huge variety of different types of people, but you know what I mean, it's, it's, I've, I've been able to kinda not pick and choose, but it kind of limits right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1231.745" data-end_ts="1231.965" title="1231.745" id=c_"1231.745">__To__</span> stuff usually a little better than the usual crowd 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1235.505" data-end_ts="1235.925" title="1235.505" id=c_"1235.505">__Yellow__</span>, yellow page group. Yeah. I, yeah. What is, I'm curious about what your, like, strangest session you've ever done. I mean, for me, the two ones that I remember the most is <span style="color:red" data-ts="1246.165" data-end_ts="1246.285" title="1246.165" id=c_"1246.165">__a__</span>, a guy who was a one man band that had like, especially tricked out upright piano. It was the most difficult thing to properly mic that I'd ever experienced that was really wacky. And the other thing was, I mean, this is the one I might have been wise to excuse myself on. It was a, a mandolin orchestra <laugh>, which <laugh> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1268.465" data-end_ts="1268.685" title="1268.465" id=c_"1268.465">__has__</span>, I mean, that's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b>Just how many, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It was like 12 mandolin players <laugh>. It was, it was pretty close to torture. So, <laugh>, I'm wondering what, for you, what, what has been some like, like some of the wackiest recordings, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b>Well this isn't really technical, but some guy, I don't know how he got ahold of me, but he wanted to record some opera vocals. He was almost kinda like, you remember Andy Kaufman had this character of this foreign guy <laugh>? Yeah. That just some random foreign guy that you couldn't tell where he was from, but he was foreign. Right. And this guy kind of talked like that. Oh no. And he shows up at my studio, he like smelled really bad and I mean, didn't look dirty, but he just smelled really bad. And then he wanted to record this stuff. So I had to tell him that we needed to leave the door <laugh>. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b>And I had to come up with some reason why, you know, technically. And then what he would do is he had these kind of music minus one opera things and he would sing over 'em <span style="color:red" data-ts="1333.205" data-end_ts="1333.685" title="1333.205" id=c_"1333.205">__because__</span> I didn't know any of this <span style="color:red" data-ts="1334.525" data-end_ts="1334.725" title="1334.525" id=c_"1334.525">__till__</span> he got here. The thing was he knew this stuff inside and out, but he was a terrible singer. So, I mean, he knew like where to come in and all this stuff. For the most part, he knew it all, you know, by heart. Right. But it was really terrible, you know, so I just tried to get the sessions done as quick as I could. I also didn't wanna like milk it out for his money either, you <span style="color:red" data-ts="1359.205" data-end_ts="1359.245" title="1359.205" id=c_"1359.205">__know__</span>? Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, I would imagine being in LA something like that happens and you gotta wonder if you aren't like on punk the show or something like that, right? <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b>Yeah, <laugh>. But I've had a few kind of more wacky things, like you're talking about, technically this month I have the La Flute orchestra coming back. I've done them two or three times and it's like nine or 10 different flutes and a conductor. So they don't, they don't do, I have video connections between my booth that are in the house <span style="color:red" data-ts="1389.745" data-end_ts="1389.965" title="1389.745" id=c_"1389.745">__in__</span>, in here. And so if they have a conductor, no click, so they watch the conductor. And one of the main things is they had always recorded kinda live concert things. 'cause it's a classical type of group. Right. And, piccolos would just kill everything. Oh, sure. And, and they have contra <span style="color:red" data-ts="1406.315" data-end_ts="1406.605" title="1406.315" id=c_"1406.315">__base__</span> like contra f flutes and sub contrares and stuff that sound just amazing. But they, they don't put out any volume. Yeah. They get buried. You know, it's just kind of like a wind going, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1418.185" data-end_ts="1418.405" title="1418.185" id=c_"1418.185">__oh__</span>, you know, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b>And so they wanted to get separation and be able to do separate yet live, which is kind of one of the things that I've pursued in my setup. So, but it involves a lot of setup because I have to get headphones for everybody and, and you know, I have the subconscious like together in one place, and then I try to get the piccolo separate from the other flutes. So if I can't get every single person isolated, but try to isolate what they want, like the soloist and things like that. So that's fairly challenging. That brings me to one of my rants if you want to hear is, is headphone mixes. 'cause one of the things I've done in my studio is I try to have separate headphone mixes for everybody. Because I've worked, after working one session for Alex Klein record at, I think it was O Henry and Burbank, or one of the high dollar studios had a bunch, they had a bunch of iso booze and a big area, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1479.845" data-end_ts="1480.165" title="1479.845" id=c_"1479.845">__because__</span> they did a lot of orchestras there too, but only two headphone mixes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b>Oh yeah. And it was ridiculous. I mean, you spend all this time trying to get a compromised headphone mix and then nobody's happy and nobody can really hear. And and they, plus I was playing Oregon. I had a Leslie and a closet off to the side. It was an <span style="color:red" data-ts="1500.775" data-end_ts="1501.125" title="1500.775" id=c_"1500.775">__aline__</span> tune that went like for 20 minutes or something that went from a whisper to like a roar. So by the time it was at the end, like if I had the organ loud enough to hear when I had the solo, it would've been blasting everybody in the quiet part. And I had to share a headphone mix. So I ended up jerry rigging my own headphone mix by putting mics on the leslie running into a little mixer with earbuds that I put inside of the headphones that I had from the studio <laugh>. So I could actually just crank the organ at that moment when I had the solo. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b>Other than that, I, I would've just been playing off of looking at my fingers. Right. Because literally, I mean, it's one thing if you're playing piano, you can crack a headphone, you can still kind of hear it. It's acoustic. Yeah. Right. You know, even if it's not enough, you can kind of hear it. But if you're playing an electronic instrument that the speaker's completely isolated from you, you know, it's all about the headphones. So at that point, I kind of vowed that I would rig up my studio so that there's always separate mixes for everybody and try to create, have reverb in 'em to create a virtual space and stuff. And I've had a number of people who were skeptical about separation that ended up going, like, I, I forgot that I was in a, in a separate room. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1573.925" data-end_ts="1574.085" title="1573.925" id=c_"1573.925">__Oh__</span>, that's cool. You know, 'cause I have video going back and forth as well and stuff. So I think that's important. 'cause one of the things is if you do have isolation, you have so much more control later in the mix. Even if you're not editing just for, you know, lack of leakage and stuff. Flex 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Flexibility. You know, I, I appreciate you seeing that. I, I had a studio and, you know, we had a very limited budget and so we decided, well, we're gonna put it in the, the mixer and the mix down <span style="color:red" data-ts="1603.465" data-end_ts="1603.685" title="1603.465" id=c_"1603.465">__in__</span> some effects and stuff. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And we totally cheaped out on the headphones. And I know for a fact there were a number of clients that liked everything about the studio, except they hated the, they hated the headphone mix and wouldn't come back. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b>Well that's, and that's the place where the rubber hits the road, where the client is like, right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b>You know, where they're, what they're hearing while they're playing. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and it seems like for you, a lot of that is related to, getting better performances. One of the things you do is you do a lot of performance recording. You know, even if it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1635.645" data-end_ts="1635.845" title="1635.645" id=c_"1635.645">__gonna__</span>, if it's gonna be mixed down or over dub, a lot of times though, you have a number of people in, in the building. Yeah. The headphone mix is one combination. What other things do you do to sort of like draw a better performance out of people? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b>Well, I'm not super like Mr. Empathetic, <laugh> psychologist, <laugh>. Okay. I usually try to just stay outta the way, try not to use judgemental language as much as possible. But at the same time, you know, it's important to be honest. Like, I, I just can't lie about music. So like, if, if somebody's just something I don't think is very good, I, I just, and they'll go, how was that? I'll just turn it around. Like, what'd you think? Yeah. You know, and then just try to see which one they like better, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Better gauge it from them. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b>But I just mostly it's just trying to make sure the headphones are, are right and everybody can see what they need to see. It's interesting that people think they need to see more than they really do. Right. Because I mean, if they're on stage, lot of 'em have their eyes closed on 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Right, right. They're not staring at it all the rest of the people. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b>But they get in the studio, they go like, oh, this guy's, I can't see him. You know, it's like, well if you're the saxophone player, you were standing in the front of the stage and everybody was behind you, could you see them either? Right. You know, I mean <laugh>, I don't know. It's kind of a case to case basis. Yeah. Just, I think the most thing is just try to make it run smooth and not 'cause technical problems. Always. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Bum people out derail, derail the thing. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b>They always happen. So it's just a matter of trying to solve 'em as quick as you can. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>If I think about it, one of the things I know is that there are a number of different ways that people do, individualized headphones. There are some people that like the engineer to control it. And you'll see either like them using a board with a ton of sends or they'll get like one of these live boards that have a big Yeah. Matrix mixer or something like that. Other people just pipe out a bunch of stuff and use like these little axiom mixers at every station. And other people just use a DAW with a ton of sends specific for headphones. What's the approach that you take for that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b>I'm kind of a believer in the engineer controlling it because as I've talked to other engineers that they use the ones where there's personal mixers for every person, if you go out at the end of the session, everything's turned up <laugh> because people, musicians who are not engineers, don't know that stuff can be turned down. Right. They always think of up. Yeah. So like, oh, I can't hear enough bass. So that comes up like, oh, now I can't hear the piano. So that goes up. So by the end of the session, they just keep cranking everything instead of realizing, oh, the bass was too loud. If I turn that down I can hear everything else. So I have a little Oz, mixer that has six outputs and four different sends. And also it has an effect thing <span style="color:red" data-ts="1808.805" data-end_ts="1809.005" title="1808.805" id=c_"1808.805">__that__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1809.015" data-end_ts="1809.365" title="1809.015" id=c_"1809.015">__stair__</span> that I use for another, stereo. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b>Oh yeah. Okay. And then I control that. And then if I need more, I do the DAW thing. I use mostly digital performer, which has qix. Right. And I'll, I'll send that out to like a little like barringer headphone mixer because I wanna have a separate one. You know, I don't need a headphone mixer with seven outputs of the same mix, you know, so it's you, if you buy the little inger $20 headphone mixer, they have like, I think four outputs, but I'll just use one of 'em, you <span style="color:red" data-ts="1842.845" data-end_ts="1842.885" title="1842.845" id=c_"1842.845">__know__</span>, and plug it into one of the outputs from DW And that's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Also just <span style="color:red" data-ts="1847.485" data-end_ts="1847.565" title="1847.485" id=c_"1847.485">__get__</span>, get enough gain <span style="color:red" data-ts="1848.045" data-end_ts="1848.165" title="1848.045" id=c_"1848.045">__there__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b>Somebody really needs a specialized mix. They'll get that because I can pan stuff around and, you know, have a whole mixer just for one person that way. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's cool. Now one of the things I noticed in reading the tape <span style="color:red" data-ts="1861.285" data-end_ts="1861.485" title="1861.285" id=c_"1861.285">__up__</span> article is that you aren't scared to talk about having gone digital relatively early and stuck with it. Is there anything about the analog domain that, that you find? I mean, it's coming, it's sort of coming back, but do you, do you have any desire ever to look back in that direction? Or do you, do you find yourself still completely satisfied with digital work? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b>Totally satisfied. <laugh>, I hate tape. I have to use it like, 'cause I, I do transfer stuff 'cause one of the things that I do is transfer old tapes and remaster 'em and stuff. Okay. Which I've, I've done the last few, not few actually, it's building up now, but our pepper stuff that Oh, yeah. Is a record company. His wife, puts out stuff. Oh. And a lot of that stuff is real tore. So, I mean, and the more I have to deal with those transfers, the more I realize how much I hate tape. 'cause you, you know, you gotta clean the heads. You gotta bake the tapes. You, you know, if they're from a certain area, you do one transfer and then something screws up, you do it again. It's like the speed is slightly different if you're trying to edit together. For me, it was like the first time I heard a CD was a classical thing in some guy's house. He had voices of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1940.085" data-end_ts="1940.205" title="1940.085" id=c_"1940.085">__the__</span> theater speakers, some big old stereo thing. He <span style="color:red" data-ts="1943.205" data-end_ts="1943.285" title="1943.205" id=c_"1943.205">__just__</span> played this classical thing and it just blew me away because a no surface noise. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b>And for me, that's, that would seal the deal right there <laugh> because it was this classical music that was starting at a PMO and you could hear every little thing. Right. You know, and, and that which would've been lost in the LP surface noise until it got to a, a certain level. Right. And for me that was like, wow, we've got a recording thing that's just the music now. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1973.915" data-end_ts="1974.205" title="1973.915" id=c_"1973.915">__Yeah__</span>. And not all this other crap. And the thing is, it's all artificial. You know, it's all recording. The only thing that's natural is you in a room listening to an acoustic instrument with no amplification. Right. Like, you know, and people get into this stuff like, that's more natural, blah blah. Life's like, no it's not. It's just, it's another technology. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. It's a, it's a different set of artifacts that maybe you aren't used to. So they see interesting. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2004.525" data-end_ts="2004.565" title="2004.525" id=c_"2004.525">__And__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b>There's certain things, it's colored in a way that people like. Yeah. And the thing is, I've figured out early on that digital, like would just bump stuff between two and three K, which was why people thought it. And it really wasn't bumped. It just wasn't cut down. Cut. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's Right. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b>So it actually was more natural to be more harsh <laugh>. Yeah. So, but people didn't like it, you know? 'cause they preferred that other sign. So all you gotta do is cut that frequency a bit. You know, and I, that's stuff that I did early on when I was like comparing what was going on. The other thing that I, that I do that not a lot of people do is I do a lot of really very tight surgical EQ cuts. Like to, I find resonances. Oh, okay. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2052.485" data-end_ts="2052.725" title="2052.485" id=c_"2052.485">__Alright__</span>. And cut them rather than doing like <span style="color:red" data-ts="2055.065" data-end_ts="2055.285" title="2055.065" id=c_"2055.065">__ma__</span>, if it's well recorded, you know, if it's not well recorded, you gotta do more radical Right. EQ things. But if it's well recorded, if you go through and you find <span style="color:red" data-ts="2064.525" data-end_ts="2064.805" title="2064.525" id=c_"2064.525">__that__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2064.905" data-end_ts="2065.125" title="2064.905" id=c_"2064.905">__the__</span>, the resonances that are kind of eaten up stuff, whether it's, you know, in the lows <span style="color:red" data-ts="2069.985" data-end_ts="2070.205" title="2069.985" id=c_"2069.985">__mid__</span> or highs, and especially in the highs, if you, if you do surgical cuts between two and three K on those nodes that are what some people call whistle tones, when you boost it, and then cut those and pretty conservatively cut 'em, you know, just a couple of DB or something, you know, you're not radically cutting it, then you, you still have that, you know, the presence that you want in that high range and you cut out harshness magically almost. 
</p>

<p>

And then also I was using, we were using a task <span style="color:red" data-ts="2158.385" data-end_ts="2158.605" title="2158.385" id=c_"2158.385">__cam__</span> MS 16, so you kind of had to use the noise reduction. Yeah. DBX noise reduction and DBX, while it was effective in some areas, it could really cook some other sounds. And it was like, especially, you know, a, a warm base tone would just get, kind of crackly and it would do this weird compression things to to symbols again that, that were just Yeah. Obnoxious. And I remember really sometimes it felt like you <span style="color:red" data-ts="2189.645" data-end_ts="2189.765" title="2189.645" id=c_"2189.645">__were__</span> really fighting the system just to get a good sound. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b>Well I have a nostalgic thing because I grew up like recording on tape, you know? Yeah. And a couple years ago I did a session that was on two inch 24 that I played on at a studio in Santa Monica. And it was kind of cool. The coolest thing is that there's a performance mentality because it is not as easy to edit and punch in and all that kind of stuff. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Or, or add 24 tracks of soloist or something. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b><laugh>. Yeah, exactly. So there's something about that. But you know, just realizing, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2223.605" data-end_ts="2223.725" title="2223.605" id=c_"2223.605">__mean__</span>, and the engineer like screwed up a couple of punches. You're waiting around for rewind. And then the performance thing has its downside too because in the group, like, the drummer and I were the best players not being egotistical 'cause we're all on the food chain at someplace. I've been the worst player in the room on a number of occasions. But, this one, you know, me and the drummer were pretty good and the other people kept blowing the takes, you know, and it was just like, oh crap man. We had to keep doing, you know, like redoing the punches where the guy would keep screwing up the punch. So we had to go back a bar before and, you know, <laugh> all this stuff. You know, so there's, there's aspects that younger people that think that they like that they don't understand some of the practical aspects. I kinda look at it like civil war, reenactors, you know, <laugh>, it's like there's something cool about it historically and everything, but you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Don't wanna live that life 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b><laugh>. No. You don't wanna ride a horse to work every day. <laugh>, you know, I might be cool one day, you know, to get the feeling for what it was like <laugh>, you know? Yeah. But I mean the technology is just head and shoulders so much better now. Right. On recording. And plus it's just a cost, you know, anytime people will <span style="color:red" data-ts="2304.925" data-end_ts="2305.165" title="2304.925" id=c_"2304.925">__send__</span>, because I have a two inch 24 here and sometimes people will go, oh, we wanna use that. You know, it's like, okay, you ready for like $345 a reel? Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Three reel's minimum for an album. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b>It was like, and they go what? <laugh> <laugh>, because I had to deal <span style="color:red" data-ts="2324.205" data-end_ts="2324.365" title="2324.205" id=c_"2324.205">__with__</span>, you know, it's just a scale of things. Like, because I went from <span style="color:red" data-ts="2326.805" data-end_ts="2327.085" title="2326.805" id=c_"2326.805">__that__</span> to eight at, 'cause I've always been kind of on the budget end of things. And you know, at a certain point when hard drive recording was coming in, you know, even people were balking at the cost of aada tape. Right, right. Which was way cheaper <laugh> than, than analog tape, you know? <span style="color:red" data-ts="2346.425" data-end_ts="2346.645" title="2346.425" id=c_"2346.425">__And__</span> you know, but once you get used to like having a hard drive that you can put every project of your whole life on one project, you know, like when people start saying, no, this is how much the tape's gonna cost, they kind of go, what? You know. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, unfortunately this has been a great conversation, unfortunately, we're already out of time and I feel like the conversation just got started. But, before I let you go, you're a person I'm anxious to ask this question on, which is, in your career, particularly on the recording side, who is the most influential person that, that has kind of helped you move forward or inspired you to move forward? And also on the gear side, what's the gear piece that you kind of identify most as part of your sound or you know, in a way a piece of gear that might've been influential too? Kinda like the, the side of both people and of the technology. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b>Yeah. Well those are hard questions for me because I don't usually think in terms of hierarchy of that kind of stuff. But in terms of people, I was lucky since I'm kind of self-taught, I was lucky enough to be able to be around people that really knew what they were doing and kind of pick their brains and watch 'em work and stuff. So in terms of real engineers not as famous as much as just really good. Yeah. Would be John Golden, who's a mastering engineer, who did a ton of stuff in the seventies, still, still doing stuff. And I got to see him master number of records that I was on or I had recorded and watch him work and watch him talk about what he was doing. 'cause he would kind of describe what he was doing while he was doing it. Uhhuh <affirmative> and then other people, I was assistant to this, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2457.275" data-end_ts="2457.565" title="2457.275" id=c_"2457.275">__Jess__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2457.835" data-end_ts="2458.125" title="2457.835" id=c_"2457.835">__Exon__</span>, Benny Wallace, when he was doing a lot of film scores in LA in the nineties and got to be on sessions at Capital and Ocean Way and Village and different places like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b>And watch engineers. Like he would use this guy Roger Rhodes from New York who'd worked with Ellington and stuff and got to watch how he would <span style="color:red" data-ts="2478.585" data-end_ts="2478.805" title="2478.585" id=c_"2478.585">__mic__</span> things. Bruce Botnick who worked with the Doors and also, Leslie Jones, the, woman, one of the first like kind of really well known woman engineers in fairly recent times who worked at Capital and people like that. So I, I had the opportunity to kind of absorb that even though I wasn't really trained. And then also in the, that period I was working at the, the Musician's Union had a recording studio and I started working there with some friends of mine that were also musician engineers and we were kind of learning together. So, that was kind of, we would compare notes and, and do stuff and whatnot. And so that the self-learning was kind of self-learning by these three guys. Vince TDA was a bass player and Jim Watson, who's a, was a drummer and they were also, good engineers or became even better <span style="color:red" data-ts="2539.585" data-end_ts="2539.805" title="2539.585" id=c_"2539.585">__in__</span>, they were much better than I was. And, and Vince actually had training, so, you know, kind of absorbed from them. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, you must have seen some amazing people come through a studio at the LA musicians unit too. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b>Yes and no. You know, because it was for the musicians, it was like subsidized and it was fairly cheap. There was some, there was some people I also, I mean, but on these movie sessions I got to work with, you know, people 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2569.405" data-end_ts="2569.525" title="2569.405" id=c_"2569.405">__Like__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2569.525" data-end_ts="2569.565" title="2569.525" id=c_"2569.525">__that__</span> that's top of the top. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b>Yeah. Yeah. Dr. John and Oh wow. Booker T and actually got the test like piano, like while Booker t was playing Organ. So I actually got to play with him. <laugh>. Oh, unreal. You know, stuff like that. And then, to your other question, gear wise, I mean, to me it's always been about trying to make the best sound to get away with the best sound with without having the complete budget. Right. You know, so when I started, like I just had some dynamics and a couple Radio Shack condensers and stuff, and Radio Shack, PCMs. And then my first really good mics were 4 21. So I got like three or four of 'em used. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And at that point I, I was using 'em for overheads 'cause they were the best things I had. Which was, is interesting because you, if you just add some trouble boost to 'em, they sound great as overheads. In fact, I listen to some of those older jazz recordings that I was doing that on and the overhead sound, you know, the drum sounds fine. <laugh>. Oh, that's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2637.405" data-end_ts="2637.485" title="2637.405" id=c_"2637.405">__Wild__</span>. I would never imagined that. That's cool. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b>Well you just do what you gotta do, you know, and I've been able to accumulate much better <span style="color:red" data-ts="2645.825" data-end_ts="2646.045" title="2645.825" id=c_"2645.825">__my__</span>, you know, as I go along. But it's also, like I said before, it's about where you put 'em, you know, because it is just, if you don't point 'em in the right place and put 'em in the right place, they're, they're not gonna sound that good. Yeah. One of my favorite little stories was that one of my early releases actually got, was gonna get reviewed in absolute sound, the audio file thing. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And the guy called me and then he actually hung up on me when I told him I use a Yamaha SPX 90 for <span style="color:red" data-ts="2680.725" data-end_ts="2680.765" title="2680.725" id=c_"2680.725">__re__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2680.765" data-end_ts="2680.885" title="2680.765" id=c_"2680.765">__reverse__</span>. Oh 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>No. <laugh> <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b>Geez. But that showed me like the total bullshit. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2686.885" data-end_ts="2687.165" title="2686.885" id=c_"2686.885">__Yeah__</span>. All of that stuff. Because basically he liked it until he found out that that what the reverb was. Right. And it just was cognitive dissonance for him. <laugh>. Oh 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>No, that's hilarious. Well Wayne, I want to thank you so much for taking the time. This was fun and like I said, it just feels like the conversation just got started. Next time I'm out in LA I am gonna look, look you up. Come, come and hang out. We'll go for coffee or something. It'll be cool to hang out face to face as well. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b>Please do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But thank you so much and with that I'm gonna let you have the rest of your day. Thank you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Wayne: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2720.115" data-end_ts="2720.605" title="2720.115" id=c_"2720.115">__Alright__</span>, thanks. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Many thanks to Wayne for spending the time to have that chat. It was really fun to get caught up with what he's doing, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2739.755" data-end_ts="2740.045" title="2739.755" id=c_"2739.755">__hear__</span> a little bit about his perspective of the ro recording world, which truly flies in the face of a lot of hipster thought. But the guy's been doing it for a long time and he's worked with a lot of great people. I wanna thank you all for listening again this week. Thanks for everyone who's been so supportive. Thanks again to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_%2774">Cycling '74</a> to Zootopia, and to all the other folks in there that are chipping in to make this <span style="color:red" data-ts="2763.085" data-end_ts="2763.205" title="2763.085" id=c_"2763.085">__a__</span> more accessible and a better place to hang out. We'll catch you next time around. Bye.
