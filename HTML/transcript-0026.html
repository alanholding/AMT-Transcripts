      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Great this week, we're talking to somebody he's a co-worker, but he's also an incredible artist across many domains. His name's Ben Bracken He's an amazing cat. He seems to know he has taught me so much about max over theyears. It's kind of embarrassing. Hi Ben, how are you? </i>
    </p>


    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Well, sure. Thanks a lot for taking time out of your schedule to, talk with us. I'm going to try and break out of, interview pattern that I've had, which is to just blurt out, you know, tell me about your background and then have people talk. And instead, I want to talk about some specific things because I kind of know you and because you're, pretty open in your CV about what you've done. And I want to talk specifically about your education at Mills college. I know that you got, an MFA at Mills. Yeah. And, did you study undergrad there too, or no? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Ben: </b>
      Mills is kind of an interesting, college in that the undergrad is entirely, it's all women. So, so actually the graduate program, which has been going for many years now, is, you know, both men and women, attend, but, yeah. So,
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Okay. Well color my face red. I didn't realize that that was the case. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Ben: </b>
      Yeah. I mean sometimes when I'll mention Mills to people, they'll get a little confused cause they won't know actually about the music program. They'll just think of it as a women's college. So they'll kind of give me a sideways look for sure.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Well, that's interesting because I think of it just the opposite. I think of it as a music school that has an incredible history. Exactly. You know, growing, growing up in and around electronic music stuff. I remember the pictures of, you know, different pieces of equipment that actually were labeled with Mills name and its interaction with the San Francisco tape, Santa and all that stuff. It, it has this really rich history. My question is how do you go there and deal with all the ghosts that are in the hallways? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Ben: </b>
      Yeah, so like, like you said, Mills kind of had this mythical existence in my imagination before I went there. And I remember seeing pictures to, and reading in different books and publications about this really rich history. So, going there, it was kind of a fantasy of mine for a really long time in between undergrad and grad. There was about a six year period where I was just kind of playing music and, working at a record store in Ann Arbor. And so by the time I got to Mills, I was really ready to dig in. You know, I had, I had spent a lot of time away from and, had developed a lot of ideas out kind of outside of that world, but then was kind of ready to get back into the fold as it were. So yeah, when I, when I went there, it's, it's, it's hard not to think about all this great stuff that has happened there, but actually while you're there, you're just kind of working really hard and, and kind of immersing yourself in and the things that you're
      interested in.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Ben: </b>
      And it's a really, I would say it's a really nurturing space. So a lot of the people who are working there currently, are just really looking to facilitate the students, going there. So the support system is just incredible and that comes both from the teachers and the students, you know, every group that goes through there is really different. I was really lucky in the sense that I went to school with a lot of really talented, people and drew a lot of inspiration from
      them, as well as the awesome staff and faculty there. Sure.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Many, like what was the size of the cohort that went through graduate school? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Ben: </b>
      I would say it's a two year program. And there's the music, department is kind of divided into three areas. There's the electronic music and recording media, which is what I did. And then there's the kind of performance major, which is yeah. Kind of dealing more with like instrumentalists and then there's the composition program. So, so I think in our group, there was probably, maybe 18 to 20, something like that. So there's, you know, there's that plus whatever is overlapping from another year, right.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>But that's, that's a nice sized group because you're going to get to know everybody, but it's going to be diverse enough to actually provide a pretty wide spread of inspiration. </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Ben: </b>
      Yeah, for sure. And I'm still, you know, collaborating and working with a lot of people that I met at Mills, while I was there. So that's, that's a really great takeaway that I was able to walk away with
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>They're electronic music and recording media, which I guess is the, study area that I find pretty fascinating. How directed of a program is it? Do they have like a step-by-step approach to teaching or is it more a collaborative environment between yourself and the teachers? As a way of pushing the envelope, </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Ben: </b>
      They definitely mix it up. So there's kind of a, a track that you follow when you decide to do the electronic music program, but there's a lot of flexibility within that. So I ended up taking a lot of classes in the art department, for example, because I, I was really interested in video and took some like an installation art class and things that kind of fall out of their electronic music programs, purview per se, but they're still really supportive of you kind of exploring, other, other areas, other offerings at the school. That's interesting. Yeah. So the other thing that they have, which is really nice is that they have kind of a program set up for people to do a lot of one-on-one classes with people with, both faculty and staff. So for example, when I got into max, actually it was because of, our coworker and friend less stuck, who is on staff at Mills. And so we had a really awesome practicum basically where he, helped me realize a performance rig that I was building.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Ben: </b>For Max, it's strange. It, I, I would say that, my first real software kind of, programming environment type thing was actually supercollider, which is also kind of a big part of the program over a Mills. But I, I remember getting a CD, back long. I don't even know, maybe like in 2001 that was like an enhanced CD rom type release by, this guy, Christoph Charles. Right. And on, on that CDR, there was a max patch that he had used to make to realize the, the music on the CD. And so I remember kind of picking apart that patch, you know, soon after it was released, but not really understanding it, but kind of using what was in that patch, in my own performance rig, but it wasn't until I got kind of midway through Mills where I really dug in and yeah, I learned so much from Les and he really opened up a whole world to me. Right.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>No, it's, it's really interesting, that you started with Les because Les has this very, broad brush approach to art. He does composition, he works with dancers. He, he does video work and it seems like, in addition to learning some Macs from him, you also apparently took some career pointers because I would say that, of the people that I know and I work with, you probably have the broadest range of things that you do, you know, so I know that you're doing, you're DJing like some soul night, which is, sounds pretty awesome. Quite frankly, you've worked in toured with bands, like, like the deed palms you've been doing installation work and composition work and performance work with, your partner, Ashley Bellouin. Is that how I pronounce it? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And, it seems like, you sort of taken, taken on a persona similar to him, which is this ability to embrace a large number of different and seeming seemingly widely variant kinds of artwork. First of all, how is it that you allow yourself to be comfortable in all these different venues? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Ben: </b>
      Well, I think I get bored really easily. So I, I definitely have this thing where especially I noticed this when I started performing solo years ago, that I would just, I had this real hesitation to do any piece more than once, you know, so I would, I would build a whole piece just for one performance and then completely ditch it. And so I have this kind of desire to keep the gears moving. And I think that working in different mediums and kind of with different ideas and with different people and different tools just really keeps me going. You know, I think that if I really focus too much on, on one thing for too long, I, I don't know if it would, I'd be able to sustain the interest and drive, you know, so I find that kind of hopping to different projects that are using radically different tools or different ideas kind of helps me. I can even come back to an old idea that I was working on before once I've kind of been reinvigorated in some other area, but yeah, I mean, for example, one of the things that Les taught me while I was at Mills was that he basically thought of max like this, toolbox that he would use when he didn't have another tool to do what he wanted to do, you know?
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Ben: </b>
      But I mean, that's just in terms of what I took away from last, like that was a big thing for me. And it turns out that I often don't have the tool that I need. So I'll turn to max a lot.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Well, it's really interesting to me that the way that you combat boredom is by, is by taking on new projects. When, if you look at sort of the history of the work that you do, do you tend to like rotate from music to visuals to installation or do you tend to have like a burst of energy in one area and then a burst of energy? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Ben: </b>
      Yeah. I would say that there are kind of longer sustained kind of periods of interest in different mediums. For example, the work that I've been doing with Ashley over the past couple of years is really picked up a lot of steam. And, and it's something that, I've been working on quite a bit, but even that project has, it really started out as a project for, building instruments. And so we had a couple ideas for, for instruments then, you know, after the instruments are built, it was like, Oh, we need to figure out what to do with these things. And so the project kind of developed from there. So then it started to turn into more of a project about building compositions based on these instruments. And then, you know, it was kind of even further developed. Now we're kind of moving into this phase of, doing a lot of recording and we're going to be, we've been working in the studio and we're, we'll be going to a friend's studio up in Petaluma in a couple of weeks to actually get some nice recordings of some of these pieces we've been doing live.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Sure. When you talk about instruments, are you talking about like virtual constructs or are you talking about physical devices? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Ben: </b>
      So, I guess about two years ago, we had a residency at a place here in Oakland called the, Paul Drescher, ensemble. I can't actually remember the name of the, the, actual residency, but, it's funded and supported by this, guide Paul Drescher, who was an instrument builder as well. We actually built, two instruments that in the physical realm, that are basically large string instruments. I think there's 36 strings on both of them. And, they're kind of what people call monochord, but I don't really know if it's, that's technically a good term for it, but it's, you know, many strings over a kind of a resonant, hollow bodied instrument that we, that we perform live with. One of the things that I find myself kind of it's, it's kind of ironic because I working with, Ashley and building these instruments was such a great way to kind of get away from the computer and actually build something with your hands. So, you know, being in a wood shop for like 10 hours a day is very, liberating to the mind, for, especially for somebody like me, who's kind of behind a computer all the time and, you know, find that that was really a great release and just kind of a different focus, but it's kind of ironic because I always kind of moved to these projects thinking, okay, I'll get away from max for a bit and, you know, do something else. And then max always kind of creeps back in sometimes.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Ben: </b>
      It's like this wasn't supposed to be about this, but then all of a sudden, you know, there's a, a reason for it, you know? So we've, we've implemented a couple of tools, in our live set that, utilize max for, some
      spatialization tools as well as some, kind of processing
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>In my head. I'm trying to envision what this is like. And my assumption is, is it ends up producing sort of like a drone like sound, would that be fair? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Ben: </b>Yeah. Yeah. And in fact, all the strings are tuned to the same note They were originally built for a specific space. So all the measurements and the tunings and stuff that we used on the two instruments were based on a, a physical space up in the Marin Headlands that we
      did a performance for <span style="color:red" data-ts="919.54" data-end_ts="919.63" title="919.54" id=c_"919.54">__them__</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Oh, interesting. So did you like tune it to match the resonance of the space? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Ben: </b>
      Yeah, it was going to, if it was an acoustic performance, so, we had to figure out a way to make these instruments as loud as possible. And that's kind of the solution that we came up with and it worked pretty well.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>How does that, first of all, translate into something that's going to work as like re recorded material. And then secondly, if it was built for a specific space, how do you present that anywhere else? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Ben: </b>
      Yeah, I mean, that's kind of been a big issue for us is trying to figure out some of these very, site-specific or, or kind of performance specific, musical terms and trying to translate that into like a recorded document, the recordings that we've had, done while we're actually performing in front of an audience are never really acceptable. There's always, you know, some wind blowing or somebody's baby crying or whatever. So trying to figure out how to capture some of the same ideas is kind of challenging. And in terms of repurposing the instruments, we've actually, you know, sense that performance use these instruments in a variety of contexts. And that's been kind of exciting to try to come up with different ways to use these instruments that were maybe built for one specific purpose, but then we're kind of finding this really rich area of exploration with the, with the instruments just as instruments, you know?
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Sure. Well, I would think that that's something that could actually, there would be a way to even figure out how to use it for like an installation, an unmanned installation rather than just a performance. Strikes me as, as having some interesting options.</i>
    </p>


    <p>
      <b>Ben: </b>
      Yeah. And actually the, the instruments kind of first started out. We got really interested in alien harps, which are basically wind harps. Right. So we actually, we built a, an installation while Ashley was at Mills. She went there years after I did the original prototype for these string instruments was actually a wind harp. So that kind of the performance, aspect of our interests kind of grew out of a series of installations that we did. So it was kind of trying to, we kind of went the other way around. So we started out kind of with the installation, in mind or series of installations in mind. And then we were trying to think of, well, we really like to actually perform to, you know, and, and I draw a lot of inspiration, from live performance is something that I'm really comfortable doing. And actually the, the recording process for me is, can be kind of painful because it's just, the concerns are so different when you're sitting in the studio. So that's what we're working on right now is trying to, trying to bridge that gap between the live performance and how recording
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      Well, sure. And good luck. I think, I think you actually hit something on the head, which is the kind of concerns in the level of shoe gazing required in, in the recording world versus the capturing excitement part of a performance. It's really hard to make that transition.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Ben: </b>
      Yeah. And I find that for myself, it's, it's really hard to do that with my own music. I've, I've been involved in a lot of recording projects that were kind of spearheaded by other people like my involvement with date palms. They were a preexisting band before I, got involved. And, it was really fun for me to step in and be part of the, you know, the live band as, as well as the, the recording process. And that was just kind of, you know, just super fun. You're like, you know, and it was a bass playing and that it was very, a very different kind of mentality, but when it comes to my own work, it's a little bit harder for me to get into the studio, as a kind of medium or whatever
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      You kind of pointed to boredom as being one way that you, one mechanism you use to select what you're going to work on. But I look at, I look at like the performance work that you've already you've done in the last few years, which is quite a stack, your work with Ashley, your other work that you do, how do you, how do you manage, how do you juggle that? Not, I'm not saying from necessarily like from a time standpoint, but sort of mentally, how do you, how do you allow yourself to set aside one thing and, and embrace another when you may not be in control of that, of when something is due or, or required?
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Ben: </b>
      Yeah. I mean, the scheduling stuff is, yeah. I mean, everybody kind of deals with that. The mental space, I find the, you know, when thinking about it, it really uses different parts of my brain. So you alluded to earlier, like I've been doing a lot deejaying over the past few years, and I have a couple of nights that I've been involved in. One, especially that I've been doing more recently, which is, a night of all international music from all around the world and that's just a blast and it's kind of, to me, uses a part of my brain that for example, my music with Ashley, it just doesn't, it doesn't even go near or, it's, it's kind of more of a party atmosphere. It's, you know, just enjoying the music of kind of an extra record collector. I try not to buy so much anymore, but my, my record collection is a little, was a little out of hand at one point, but this is kind of a way for me to justify its continued existence.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Ben: </b>
      Right. So, yeah, I mean, and, and the, the bass playing that I've done with date palms and actually just last week recorded, a track for a friend, Chuck, Johnson's a new record playing bass for him. And the bass playing is this kind of other very, to me, very liberating part of, part of music making that, that I really, it's just really enjoyable. I don't have to think too critically about it. I can just, step in and, and play what kind of sounds good, you know, and, and kind of helping out other people, you know, by stepping in. So it, I think it just comes down to finding different spaces in my brain that are kind of satisfied by these different outlets. I do. I think that, like, if, for example, I had another performance, collaboration right now with somebody else that was kind of really intensive and thoughtful and covered similar territory that from what Ashley and I would be where we're doing, it would be difficult for me to sustain that, you know, it would just be kind of too much. And I I'd have to just kind of pick, you know, one or the other. So, as long as it fits, fits somewhere in my mind that it doesn't have too much overlap, I can kind of maintain those interests.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>So that, that helps me understand how you cope with it. But there's another, there's another thing I'm curious about is how do you think that I don't even know what the word to use, maybe how do you think art patrons out there, react to someone who they may see deejaying one weekend and doing an art installation the next, I mean, I, I I'm, I don't know the answer to this. It's not a leading question. I'm just curious what you think, because, it's not that I care because I, I tend to do some similar to you. I have a lot of different interests and I'm out to satisfy myself, but maybe I, I set a low bar for myself. Right. My, my question is, especially as some of this stuff, you're starting to do more things in, galleries and, in public art areas and stuff. Yeah. Do you ever worry that having too diverse of a portfolio actually could harm you? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Ben: </b>
      I think about that all the time, because I just cannot escape this. Basically. I struggle with keeping a strong focus in one area for a really long time. And I think I look at, some of my contemporaries, especially in the art world where they're really forced, or they feel forced, to kind of nail down one shtick that they do. And they, you know, do it really well, but then they're kind of backed into this corner of like, Oh, you're the guy that always does the thing with the led ball or whatever it is, you know, and that's your thing. And you have to, you know, as long as you do that, you're kind of accepted into the establishment. And if you start deviating from that, then there's kind of a PR either, you know, partially perceived, I think, but also a real issue of like, maybe nobody's going to be interested in the free jazz banjo clown routine that you have.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Yeah. The flip side of it is, you know, I guess for me, I, I can't imagine anything sadder than to be pigeonholed when you're 22 and never be able to escape that pod. Right. Yeah. I have to admit you talk a little bit about your solo work, but most of the things that you do that I'm, I'm familiar with have been collaboration's of some sort and right now, again, if I look at, the CV that you and Ashley have put together, you're too a lot of work. What is it about the collaboration process that frees you to stay focused or does, does the stuff that you and Ashley do kind of waver about in terms of what you're doing? I'm, I'm not familiar with all of the stuff that you see here, but it seems interesting that the collaboration certainly as long form yeah, yeah. With the material itself, isn't I definitely, </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Ben: </b>
      And I think this is, as I've gotten older, I've become a lot more interested in collaboration. I, I spent a good chunk of my, you know, mid twenties to early thirties doing a lot of solo work and doing a lot of live performance stuff and some installation stuff and kind of the, the older I get or the more experienced I get, the more I value, working collaboratively, part of it is that I just don't have enough hands to do all the things that I want to do. You know, and, and I'm not much of a top-down kind of person, like I'm not super interested in like, ordering a small army of people to do my bidding. So I'd much rather actually involve myself in creative experiences that have a lot of input from people that I trust and, and people whose opinions I value.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Ben: </b>
      And I just learned so much more and I feel like the collaborations are just more meaningful too, because it's kind of greater than the sum of its parts, where when I play a solo show, there's, that's it, you know, I just, I put something on the table and, and that's, that's all there is, but with collaboration, there's all these kinds of really amazing things that can take place that you never anticipated. And so I think that's why I kind of keep on coming back to that. And more and more so, even Ashley and I's work, we're kind of reaching out to different collaborators and we've done a series of collaborations with, some filmmakers. Some are still in progress that are really, really gratifying. And especially working with filmmakers whose language is so different than, than ours. And it's been producing a lot of really interesting results.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>Well, that's, that's incredible. So in, in a collaborative environment, what role do you find yourself taking, you know, do you find yourself being sort of like, you know, and I hate to sort of like label anything, but a lot of times, you know, roles get sort of like parceled out where one person gets to be the hyper emotional artist, you know, and another person is the grinded out person with the screwdriver or whatever. I'm just wondering how do you, where do you find yourself sort of like naturally gravitating when, when you're working on a collaboration? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Ben: </b>
      Well, I can say music for musical collaborations. I find a lot of room, you know, a lot of ideas. My ideas come with kind of, arranging, material. Although I I'm super interested in, you know, general generating raw kind of musical ideas. A lot of the stuff that I find really satisfying actually has to do with kind of arranging preexisting material. So once the material is somewhat generated, finding how it all kind of fits together. So, and I've been, you know, back when I was in pop bands and stuff like that, I would do a lot of the arrangements for the bands that I was in. It was something that I kind of gravitated towards naturally. Yeah. And, you know, I would say that one thing that I'm not good at that I always am excited when somebody else's is good at it, in a collaboration, kind of the promotional side of things I'm really bad at keeping
      up a website or even making sure that the people know that the show is happening.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Ben: </b>
      So I've, I've definitely appreciated, different collaborations that I've done where there's somebody a little bit more, more motivated than that department for Ashley and I, it really, it's, it's a really interesting collaboration in the sense that we share a lot of the responsibilities across the board, because we both have a background, in recording. And because we both know max and, you know, we both have really strong interest in and, instrument building. There's a lot of back and forth that happens. And, you know, sometimes that can be difficult when we're kind of, you know, working on top of each other. And there's a little bit of room for like, Oh, do you want to do this? Or do you want to do, you know, kind of back and forth, but, but actually it's, it's been really, really great to kind of know that the other person has the skills to be able to kind of fill in when maybe you've run out of ideas or, you know, your tank is empty and, and you need somebody else to step in, like say I've edited for something for four hours.

      <b>Ben: </b>
      And my brain is fried and, you know, Ashley, I have complete confidence and, and what she does to take a step back and let her have a crack at it. So that's really cool. And it's not something that I think happens that often, or it hasn't happened that often to me where it's been successful, because usually you'll find collaborations and yeah, it's, it's good and important to have really kind of discreet roles often, because the work happens a lot quicker. If everybody kind of knows what they're responsible for, but this has, it's been really gratifying because, we have a lot of the same skills and interests and it's been working well.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>We're setting out there for our listeners is this concept that collaboration really can, can help you be more productive and efficient as well as more inspired often, but it's not always perfect in your experience. What are the things in collaborations that end up being conflicts or were, where do you end up seeing conflicts occur? </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Ben: </b>
      Well, I think, you know, this is probably no surprise, but it's, it's really comes down to personalities. And I, I really think that underneath even like the kind of some problems that come up that are considered maybe more technical in nature, it comes down to the people that you're working with, at least for me. And if you can kind of, navigate the kind of social space that you're in with somebody successfully, I think the collaboration is it's just, it's
      probably going to work on some level, you know,
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      <i>There's such work with Ashley, you've with a number of people. How do you know when a collaboration is done? I ask this because I have to admit I've collaborated with a number of people. And sometimes, you know, you get the sense either they're ready to move on, or you feel in your gut that you're ready to move on, but it's a really difficult thing to sort of dissolve because of the high levels of emotion and trust in, and a respect that a successful collaboration produces. It, it also then sort of has this built-in sense of responsibility. Like I'm responsible for this person in some way. And, you know, I want to go, you know, I want, I want to go and work with someone else. And, you know, is that like, I mean, it ends up almost like with all of these, spousal phrases, right. Am I, am I cheating on my collaborative? You know, how in your experience, how do you know, how do you know when a collaboration is done and how do you approach that done this? I'm, you know, again, I'm curious because not a
      thing I'm good at it.</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Ben: </b>
      Yeah. I think that for me, most of the time, what happens is real life kind of setup sets in on some, at some point. So like, you know, I've had so many times where it's, there's some external force that determines whether the collaboration is going to continue or not, you know, somebody moves away or somebody gets a really great opportunity to do this other project and they just don't have any time logistically to work, with what you're doing together. I think it is interesting though, like kind of knowing when some, when, when an idea has been kind of seen through, and I think the times that I've experienced that the most has been, have been in like kind of more like band type settings where, you know, after our record or something like that has been recorded, you're kind of like, okay, well that, that was good. And, and now we can all do something else. And, and, and it's, it's nice when it happens kind of collectively when you kind of both, you know, or whoever you're working with the everybody's on the same page, but I'm sure that that doesn't happen that often and are often happens some other way. But yeah, I think, I think sustaining long-term collaborations while kind of getting involved in different things, different collaborations, it can be, it can be difficult.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>One last question, and then we'll, we'll kind of wrap up, but, when I look at the list of works that you and Ashley had been doing, you ha you are generally doing a lot of work. I mean, it's listing here that you've already done like four performances already this year. Well, and there's been some lecture and stuff like that. I'm going to ask the question that I think a lot of people out there are going to be wondering in their head, which is where do you
      get these gigs, man?
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Ben: </b>
      Yeah, I mean, with, with the project that Ashley and I are doing, it's, it's been really interesting to see that there's this really strong overlap, between the visual art world. And I think that's part partially because of how we perform. And there's also kind of a, a tendency in the Bay area for a desire to kind of keep like expand the world of visual art. So, you know, we'll get an opportunity to work with somebody who has something at your ***<inaudible>*** or up at DeRosa, that a friend of ours had had an installation that was basically a long string instrument, sculpture that we performed on. So I think that last year, Ashley and I had a residency at a place called, Djerassi, which is a con artist program in Woodside, California. And, and we met a lot of really great artists there.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Ben: </b>
      And I think because our involvement with dressy and the connections that we made there, there's just a lot more, it kind of opened up a world that might, that kind of expands beyond the world of like experimental music, for example. And so we're getting a lot of requests, from artists that we might not be familiar with that are doing completely different things in a different medium that's, that's really exciting for us to kind of, yeah. Again, like it goes back to this, like being inspired by collaborations. The thing that we're going to be recording in a couple of weeks is for a project done by our good friend, John Davis, who is working on a, a box set of, double LP DVD set of that is a bit of a compendium or a compilation of a couple of different visual artists paired with a couple of different, sound artists. And the project is called a gravity spells. And it it's basically, I'm going to focus on this Bay area scene that where there's this collaboration between filmmakers and musicians
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      Sounds really incredible hope. You'll keep everybody informed of that as that is coming together. Do you and Ashley, or do you personally have any other big plans or big projects that, that are coming up in the near future?
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Ben: </b>
      Trying to think just, yeah, more collaboration with Ashley. We have a couple of, shows coming up, as well as that recording project. We're hoping to try to release something, this year, actually in a physical media to, to get to people and yeah, more DJ gigs. I'm going to be deejaying a DJ the third, Wednesday of every month at the make-out room in San Francisco for international freak out a Gogo and then a what a great name. Yeah. And it's fun. It's a blast. And then there's a arts organization here in Berkeley, California called Cola arts, and I'll be deejaying their 40th anniversary, April 17th.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      Wow. That sounds great. Well, thanks a lot Ben for your time. I appreciate it. And I appreciate you kind of, being willing to entertain me with both my curiosity, both Mills and about the collaborative process. I think that a lot of times people just sort of shrug their shoulders and say collaboration. It works somehow. And I think that it's actually interesting to sort of explore it and intellectualize the budget a little bit. So I appreciate you being willing to skate along with me on that one.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Ben: </b>
      Yeah. Thanks so much, Darwin. This has been fun. I mean, when you are forced to talk about things like this, there's always kind of revelations for in it for, for both the questionnaire and the questionnaire. So
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Darwin: </b>
      Trueenough. Well, I hope that, you had a good revelation. I've learned a lot today, so thanks a lot and have a
      great day.
