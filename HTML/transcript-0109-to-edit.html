<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. This week I have the pleasure of hopefully introducing you to somebody for whom I'm a big fan. His name's Giorgio St. Christopher, is that right? Yes. Okay. That's correct. <laugh>, sorry. He's, he's a phenomenal guy, but mostly, I got to know him through his, the software he creates, he created, a number of software packages. Probably the most famous was the Glitch Lab series. But, the one that I fell in love with was a software package called Burnout, which, attempted to emulate some of the, some of the functions, but also some of the limitations of the original electronic music studios. And so, I, I am, I've been showing that to everyone I can. I love the software. And with that, I want to say hello to Giorgio. Hi, man. How are you doing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio Sancristoforo: </b>Hello. Thank you very much for inviting me. I'm very fine. You, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm doing well. Thanks for being on the podcast. I was really excited when you were willing to do this, because I wanna learn more about the background of the software that you wrote. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b><laugh>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="81.405" data-end_ts="81.525" title="81.405" id=c_"81.405">__Yes__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I've already talked, I've already started blabbering about Berna. I'm a big fan. I use it to show students in, university, some of the, some of the things about the original electronic music, studios. I also share it with every other instructor and student that I can. Why don't you tell us a little bit about why you made that software and some of the details in creating it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>Well, yeah. It all began in the mid 2000 when I was, making some, documentaries about electronic music. And I was doing that for the Italian MTV. And I've been always a huge fan of, contemporary music. And I have <span style="color:red" data-ts="126.405" data-end_ts="126.525" title="126.405" id=c_"126.405">__a__</span>, you know, electronic music background mostly, but not all, not only in the contemporary field. And, well, I visited the original studios, here in Milan at the Studio <span style="color:red" data-ts="144.235" data-end_ts="144.525" title="144.235" id=c_"144.235">__Phia__</span>, the electronic music studio, founded in 1954 by the composers, <span style="color:red" data-ts="151.345" data-end_ts="151.565" title="151.345" id=c_"151.345">__Rio__</span> and, Bruno Moderna. And I felt in love with the equipment. You know, these huge machines were built inside the national television, to create <span style="color:red" data-ts="165.405" data-end_ts="165.525" title="165.405" id=c_"165.405">__a__</span> laboratory, for electronic music. But not also because in, in the morning, the studio was working as a post-production facility for the national television and the radio. And in the evening, in the night, the artist came in and they could do whatever they want. And we had such, composers from also United States, like of course, John Cage. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> hosted there to, as a matter of fact, he did realize, two, important pieces. One was made at the studio, and it was, the fonts. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>Yeah. That was, I think it was 1958. Unreal. And, we have, we still have in the museums in Milan, these equipment. And along that, we find the original notes of <span style="color:red" data-ts="218.515" data-end_ts="218.805" title="218.515" id=c_"218.515">__John__</span> Cage who did, redesign the equipment on some, paper uhhuh <affirmative>, you know, millimeter paper. Right. So we used that as a, historical documentation to see how the studio changed in the sec in the sixties and in the seventies. Oh, sure. Okay. And, and then at some point, I, I have to say, almost immediately I started thinking, <span style="color:red" data-ts="245.675" data-end_ts="245.965" title="245.675" id=c_"245.675">__well__</span>, why don't anybody try to simulate this equipment to show the kids who are learning electroacoustic music or, synthesis, how it was done, how it was different from the paradigm of, sequencers and drum machines and synthesizers that we had in the seventies and in the eighties. So it was a very, instructive idea. You know, it was, it was something meant to be an aid for students. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. Well, that certainly aligns with my experience, because in working with it, two things happen. First of all, people are amazed at some of the limitations. You know, I think it has been so long since we've been controlling electronic music instruments with keyboards, either through midi or before that, through control voltage. And when all of a sudden your only means for controlling pitch is by turning a great big knob. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>Yeah. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's a little scary. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>Yeah, it is. It is, of course, the, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="318.785" data-end_ts="319.005" title="318.785" id=c_"318.785">__era__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="319.025" data-end_ts="319.245" title="319.025" id=c_"319.025">__up__</span>, before the control voltage and, it was old manual stuff. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, unfortunately, <span style="color:red" data-ts="326.465" data-end_ts="326.885" title="326.465" id=c_"326.465">__burner__</span> cannot simulate the one, the most important, phase of the work of the times, which was the tape manipulation Verna. It's only, partially simulating that. And that's of, of course, something I cannot do in <span style="color:red" data-ts="343.165" data-end_ts="343.565" title="343.165" id=c_"343.165">__maximum__</span> sb very easily, or maybe I will do it in the future, <laugh>. But nevertheless, it shows you exactly the limits. And the limits are very important because, you know, the limits are much more like, an algorithm. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>And, when you have those pieces and those limitations, you, of course, you end up music, making music that sounds like in the fifties. And, so it's, it's pretty interesting to see how it was different, how much was, complicate. And of course, also intuitive. Right. In some ways, especially in, in the Moderna poetics, which was, kind of very different from, for example, SCASS Moderna was the one who had a more profound sense of history. He, he was well, well aware that it, it was about evolution and not making stuff from scratch. It was evolution. So it was the practice, the electronic musical practice of Madena and also <span style="color:red" data-ts="414.165" data-end_ts="414.455" title="414.165" id=c_"414.165">__Nono__</span>. And indeed, of course, <span style="color:red" data-ts="416.515" data-end_ts="416.735" title="416.515" id=c_"416.515">__Rio__</span> was, more musical to my, to my ears. Sure. So, so this equipment is very primitive, of course. But, I ask also myself, what happened if this equipment is used by modern musicians? Right. There's something can, can, can, can we have something new from this? I don't know. I think it's possible. However, the, the, the principle, the most important <span style="color:red" data-ts="447.675" data-end_ts="447.895" title="447.675" id=c_"447.675">__fo__</span> focus about that software is education and learning history, through, you know, experience 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right now. I I actually think that the educational aspect is important, but really some of the way that burnout emulates an electronic music studio shows also some of the, some of the preferences that Yeah. Electronic studios used to have. So right now, in our modern day where we have either software instruments or, you know, modular synths or whatever, we can have a vast array of whatever. Indeed. But what was, what was clear in looking at the, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="494.895" data-end_ts="495.245" title="494.895" id=c_"494.895">__Burna__</span> software and your sort of like, encapsulation of the studio Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, is that there were two areas that were really, really important in these early studios. One was these high precision oscillators. That's and having a's <span style="color:red" data-ts="510.085" data-end_ts="510.125" title="510.085" id=c_"510.085">__true__</span> and having a bunch of 'em. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>Yeah. That's, that's, that's correct. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And then secondly was having a lot of tape recorders, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. There's, there was actually relatively little gear in between the two. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>That's, that's correct. In, well, of course, the tape recorders, I start from the tape recorders because it's, I think it, it's the most important, right? The tip recorders, were, the more you had, the more things you could do. And they had, if I remember well, they had at least two recorders or four recorders at, a fourth of inch Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and, mono. And then they had also two <span style="color:red" data-ts="556.735" data-end_ts="556.955" title="556.735" id=c_"556.735">__stu__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="557.305" data-end_ts="557.595" title="557.305" id=c_"557.305">__four__</span> trucks, the same used by the Beatles in the sixties. And of course, these tapes were all <span style="color:red" data-ts="564.175" data-end_ts="564.595" title="564.175" id=c_"564.175">__sinked__</span> together, by a machine built by the physician, Alfred ti <span style="color:red" data-ts="570.415" data-end_ts="570.635" title="570.415" id=c_"570.415">__ti__</span> was the physician working inside the, the, the rye, the national television. And he was in charge of the technical equipment. And it did build a lot of, processors that not even the German studio had Uhhuh <affirmative>. For example. For example, in 1954, this studio was the, the only one on planet Earth having nine osci <span style="color:red" data-ts="595.735" data-end_ts="595.955" title="595.735" id=c_"595.735">__lit__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, which was kind of big, you know, because <span style="color:red" data-ts="598.635" data-end_ts="599.275" title="598.635" id=c_"598.635">__Stockhouse__</span> did, most of it works with one osci only. Right, right. So it was before the air CA synthesizer in Columbia University. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And it was a kind of breakthrough of technology. And, of course, the most, the, the, the most important thing for them, I think it was the construction of the, of the timber, of the color, of the sounds. That's, that's the reason. Because they used scientific machines, you know? Right. Of course. They add only that, but that those, those equipment, sometimes took from, from old radio departments, was measurement equipment, you know, was, just stuff to measure stuff and <laugh>, and then, and then they <span style="color:red" data-ts="648.665" data-end_ts="648.885" title="648.665" id=c_"648.665">__use__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="648.945" data-end_ts="649.165" title="648.945" id=c_"648.945">__the__</span>, this, measurement ideology, of music perfectly written in, in milliseconds and frequencies. That's, that's, that required those kinds of machines, you know, because the synthesizer is not so precise. The synthesizer is an approximate, approximate machine, which also is very, mostly, used in a tonal way. Right. But those instruments were forgetting about everything about tonal and harmony. It was all about frequencies and micro, distances from the nodes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, and also the, the ability to build up timur. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>Yeah, yeah. Through, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Through this manipulation and, and the mixing of many, many oscillators. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>Yeah. That, that was, that was an idea of, of course of the different, composer who went to in the studio and asked, equipment to <span style="color:red" data-ts="715.225" data-end_ts="715.645" title="715.225" id=c_"715.225">__Alfred__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="716.765" data-end_ts="716.965" title="716.765" id=c_"716.765">__Ri__</span> was <span style="color:red" data-ts="717.265" data-end_ts="717.485" title="717.265" id=c_"717.265">__sir__</span>, who written this electronic piece called Scbi. <span style="color:red" data-ts="722.665" data-end_ts="722.885" title="722.665" id=c_"722.665">__It__</span> was who, it basically was the use of, random short envelopes of noise. And those equipment to do these random envelopes were built inside the television by, <span style="color:red" data-ts="740.415" data-end_ts="740.635" title="740.415" id=c_"740.415">__ti__</span>. So it built a lot of specialized equipment. Very, very new actually. Right. You know, and that, that was the power of the studio. You know, they don't have to rely to, only to, for example, oscillators coming from Germany or England, they built stuff inside. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, and I think that that's an important, that's yet another one of these considerations. Not only was the tech technology immature, but in a lot of cases it had to be developed, or maybe something existed, but you just couldn't get it, so you'd have to make your own version. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>Yeah. They don't have budget. Right. You know. Right. You know, the, the, the national television told them, okay, you can do whatever you want, <laugh>, but no money. Right. <laugh>, you do this at no money, <laugh>. That was the point, you know? Right. Of course, it was national television. You know, we have national television in Italy. We have networks are just stuff of the <span style="color:red" data-ts="802.895" data-end_ts="803.115" title="802.895" id=c_"802.895">__ni__</span> eighties, nineties. But the, the private networks are, are very recent in Italian history. <span style="color:red" data-ts="809.475" data-end_ts="809.595" title="809.475" id=c_"809.475">__I__</span> see. We had this national big television fantastic with, with, you know, excellent radio programs and television, but they have no money for electronic music. They say, okay, we give you a technician, a physician, and, every equipment you want to, dismount in, in the basement. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> <laugh>. And you can build whatever you want. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Just don't ask for a check. Right. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>Yeah. That's, that's, that's it. <laugh>, but this way, anyway, they produce so much music. So in interesting, for example, electronic poetry and, and, you know, so many radio programs. That's, that's fascinating. I find radio, the, the, the key of electronic music, the radio, the way it was written, it was not, not for, you know, they, they written electronic music, not for the records, not for, d lp. They written electronic music for a radio experience, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You know? Yeah. And that's actually kind of interesting though, because, you know, you talk about this in Italy, but there are similar stories Yeah, <span style="color:red" data-ts="874.555" data-end_ts="874.755" title="874.555" id=c_"874.555">__yeah__</span>. Throughout Europe and even in some cases, the United States. But it, it, it tends to be more of a European thing because of this concept of the national tv. Exactly. Exactly. And, and the fact that that ended up almost like, like a venue for experimental sound work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>Yeah, that's correct. That's what happened exactly in, in three countries, very similar on this point of view, which are Germany and France. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know, of course, the, the first experiment of, Harry <span style="color:red" data-ts="909.715" data-end_ts="910.405" title="909.715" id=c_"909.715">__<inaudible>__</span> were in the National radio of, of Paris, of France. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Of France. Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>And, and of course, in Germany at <inaudible>, in <span style="color:red" data-ts="919.045" data-end_ts="919.365" title="919.045" id=c_"919.045">__colon__</span>, they made this electronic music with national radio. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So it was also Poland. It was the same, you know, it was a kind of, I don't know, cultural expansion to new frontiers by the national net big networks, you know? Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So now in attempting to emulate what they did in these studios, what is the thing, what, what are the things that were hardest to emulate using today's technology? Obviously, tape manipulation is one. Yeah. There's, there's not really an, an easy equivalent of No. Physically cutting or stretching the tape, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>Or No, it's, it's, it's not possible. I mean, it's, I dunno, maybe with the, with the new <span style="color:red" data-ts="962.915" data-end_ts="963.205" title="962.915" id=c_"962.915">__mark__</span>, I think it's, the number seven, 7.1, actually. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Right. It's, it's possible to do some stuff, but the point is that you miss the, physical experience 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="975.285" data-end_ts="975.405" title="975.285" id=c_"975.285">__<crosstalk>__</span> the physical nature of it. Right. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>You know, I, when I, when I started sound engineering in, in the early 2000, I was, I was using tape. I was, I was cutting tape as a exercise. So I really know the difference between, you know, digital manipulation and, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="994.245" data-end_ts="994.525" title="994.245" id=c_"994.245">__analog__</span> tape, you know, glue, copy, copy and paste on the right. That's that experience. It's unique, of course. But, but the machines, you know, they are, the blocks on which we have built, for example, MaxMSP or Pure Data, they are the same actually of the studios. Like in the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1016.045" data-end_ts="1016.125" title="1016.045" id=c_"1016.045">__field__</span>, they, they have just more, right. More new, new features, but the basics are still there. I mean, modulators, ring modulators, oscillators filters, that, that stuff is the, the building block of electronic music. So it was not difficult to make it, it was impossible, of course, to, to reach for, an original sound, even though I made some experiments, for example, using, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1043.645" data-end_ts="1043.965" title="1043.645" id=c_"1043.645">__study__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1044.365" data-end_ts="1044.685" title="1044.365" id=c_"1044.365">__<inaudible>__</span> of about the sound, how, how to make it sounding like the original recording. But Berna is more like on the process rather than the sound. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So now, I want to talk about another piece of software, and this is the one that I, you actually first came on my radar because of this, and it was the Glitch Lab software. Yes, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Which was probably the most over the top looper type system I'd ever seen in my life. <laugh>, it broke my head sometimes it was, it was so complex, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But, but it was one of those things where it took a couple of basic concepts like this, this cross patching modulation system, Uhhuh, <affirmative> and multiple, multiple either synchronized or Unsynchronized loops. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Those, those kind of concepts. I mean, they got in my head and even though I stopped using Glitch Lab, so many of those techniques became really a part of my personal shtick. Right. How much of that was your personal vision for an instrument? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>Well, that, that, you know, glitch Lab Exactly. Born because, I was looking for a very personal instrument. And, since my first experiments with MaxMSP, and I started using Max on version, I think 4.3 on, on the Os, nine on <span style="color:red" data-ts="1149.305" data-end_ts="1149.425" title="1149.305" id=c_"1149.305">__a__</span> Mac. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, since then, my, my, my idea was to work on sounds on, on loops in a different way, on, not on Arrhythmical way. Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>But rather, with, with the intention of creating a stream of sounds. So, this <span style="color:red" data-ts="1173.235" data-end_ts="1173.585" title="1173.235" id=c_"1173.235">__avail__</span> idea originally was called Haiku, but it never went outside my home. Okay. It was just the first experiment of a few modules with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1186.465" data-end_ts="1186.705" title="1186.465" id=c_"1186.465">__like__</span>, which I call Haiku, because they were small and liter processes. Combine it together. And then of course, you know what happens when you start patching, you end up patching more and more and more, and, and the stuff became big and bigger and bigger. And at, at that point, at one point, I, I, I decided to create this little monster called Glitch <span style="color:red" data-ts="1211.145" data-end_ts="1211.345" title="1211.145" id=c_"1211.145">__Lab__</span>. And if you, if you, if you ever seen the first version or the second version before the number three, there is no Glitch Lab, version the same. I mean, every version has completely different processes. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>I don't make it to, you know, I, just don't, don't look at this as, kind of, commercial thing. You know, I think that Glitch <span style="color:red" data-ts="1240.305" data-end_ts="1240.425" title="1240.305" id=c_"1240.305">__Lab__</span> is more, an expression, of my poets in Sound in a, in a particular moment. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, as a matter of fact, the newest version of Glitch Lab will be completely different or almost very different in, in terms of processes, from the version number three. But of course, what happens that you give your tools to other people and they start making stuff you can't even think about. You can't 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Imagine. That's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>Right. You can't imagine, of course, you know, they start exploring it and ex exploring it, and they create their own personal vision. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, I got fascinated by this idea of creating my instruments, because I was a fan, of course, of Donald Buchla and Robert Moog and all the inventors, incredible inventors. And, also I think that composers are inventors. So I think it's the most logical thing for <span style="color:red" data-ts="1302.815" data-end_ts="1302.935" title="1302.815" id=c_"1302.815">__a__</span> electronic musician to start building instruments. I don't know, with, with software. It's so easy now. That's, that it to me seems almost impossible to make electronic music without making software for making it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That's a, that's a great point. And it's, it does seem like there's a resurgence of inst instru of interest in making personal instruments. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>Yeah. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But you were out on the front of that because you were doing this, you know, using <span style="color:red" data-ts="1332.755" data-end_ts="1332.975" title="1332.755" id=c_"1332.755">__Max__</span>, but, but sort of doing it in an instrument building way rather than in a coding way, which I thought was kind of interesting. Now, my question is, how do you take something that you think of as your personal instrument, Uhhuh <affirmative> and, and then sort of like swallow hard and say, okay, everybody, here it is. You wanna buy it. That has to be really hard. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>Well, you know, I have this, feeling about my software, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1363.595" data-end_ts="1363.815" title="1363.595" id=c_"1363.595">__so__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1363.815" data-end_ts="1364.055" title="1363.815" id=c_"1363.815">__course__</span> they are kind of childs for me. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I realized after some time that those software, I'm <span style="color:red" data-ts="1373.755" data-end_ts="1373.975" title="1373.755" id=c_"1373.755">__my__</span> music in a way, and my music is my software in a way. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But, you know, to share those instruments for a very fair price, it gives me, lots of satisfaction because I can see people, using it in, in new ways and creating their own music. So, I'm happy because I've created something for me, but also for the people, not just for me. You know? Sure, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>Of course. I have secrets, <laugh>, of course. Right, right. Of course, I have some process which I don't show. Right. But I, I love to create stuff for people. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, one of the things that I, and a lot of people who who follow your work were very sad to see was the statement on the bottom of the Glitch Lab page that says, no Glitch, lab four will be produced. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Except recently in your blog you said, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1426.905" data-end_ts="1427.125" title="1426.905" id=c_"1426.905">__ah__</span>, you know, I'm gonna have to make Glab four. Yeah. But also, you mentioned that it will be released along with like a release of your music. Is that true? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>Yeah, that's, that's a new idea I have actually, that has been a time in which, I wanted to explore new things beside <span style="color:red" data-ts="1448.745" data-end_ts="1448.965" title="1448.745" id=c_"1448.745">__Lit__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1448.985" data-end_ts="1449.205" title="1448.985" id=c_"1448.985">__Lab__</span>, you know? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, especially, I got very interested deeply inside the computer assisted composition using, for example, software, like Open Music, right. By <span style="color:red" data-ts="1461.825" data-end_ts="1462.245" title="1461.825" id=c_"1461.825">__Viacom__</span> Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, so for, for Time, I've been much involved in that kind of instruments, you know? And, I, I wasn't sure about making another version, because I would like to underline, these are not really real commercial software. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1484.005" data-end_ts="1484.245" title="1484.005" id=c_"1484.005">__They__</span>, those are kind of little ideas I, I, I give away.

I was like, I cannot, I cannot stop it, you know, because it <span style="color:red" data-ts="1513.885" data-end_ts="1514.045" title="1513.885" id=c_"1513.885">__was__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1514.045" data-end_ts="1514.245" title="1514.045" id=c_"1514.045">__it__</span>, it is so beautiful. You know, I have some wonderful tools now that I cannot, I cannot do this, you know, I must create another <span style="color:red" data-ts="1524.365" data-end_ts="1524.605" title="1524.365" id=c_"1524.365">__<inaudible>__</span>. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. I hear <span style="color:red" data-ts="1525.605" data-end_ts="1525.765" title="1525.605" id=c_"1525.605">__you__</span>. So, some of why Glee <span style="color:red" data-ts="1528.025" data-end_ts="1528.245" title="1528.025" id=c_"1528.025">__Lab__</span> three kind of was put away was because you wanted to explore some other things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>Yeah. Yeah. And that's, that's reflect, you know, as I told you, the fact that these software, are not made for a commercial idea of big mass selling up process of Right. Of softwares, you know, and also, but, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But do you think that, do you think that that's important? Because here's what I would say, there are certain kinds of software, like let's say Ableton Live or Pro Tools. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> where they have to exist for the mass of humanity to use 'em. Right? Yeah. But I think that an increasing amount of the most interesting music making devices are Yeah. These kind of personal idiosyncratic things. Yeah. And whether, and whether you're talking about, again, like the new modular synthesizers Yeah, yeah. Some of the crazy little guitar pedals and stuff that you can get, the resurgence of tape loopers that is coming along as well as looping in general, all these kinds of things. None of them are really mass market devices. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>That's, that's true. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1596.755" data-end_ts="1597.045" title="1596.755" id=c_"1596.755">__What__</span>, that's why we have this, incredible explosion of little digital <span style="color:red" data-ts="1602.235" data-end_ts="1602.725" title="1602.235" id=c_"1602.235">__devices__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1603.435" data-end_ts="1603.725" title="1603.435" id=c_"1603.435">__says__</span> such as The Berry or Arduino. Right. And of course, the, the stuff you're saying is true, the, the most biggest breakthroughs are in personal technology, rather than in mass market technology. Right. You know, I make this software because I feel something in a particular moment of my life. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, and that's, that's the reason. There's, there's no other commercial intention behind it. There's no, I, I, you know, I like to give it away, but if I don't feel it to make it, I'm not interested, you know? Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That makes a lot of sense. That's, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>It's like making a song, you know, it's like finding the good chord you want to, you want to use. That's like, it, it's inspiration. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Absolutely. <laugh>. So when, when do you think, glitch Lab four will be available? Do you have a sense 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>Of what <span style="color:red" data-ts="1665.045" data-end_ts="1665.365" title="1665.045" id=c_"1665.045">__you've__</span> done? Well, I'm sure it'll be 2016. Okay. But, you guys have to be a little patient because, I'm, I'm kind of half away finishing programming the software. The, the state of the project is quite advanced at this moment, so, it's Sure you can be sure that you will have Glitch Lab for in 2016. Okay. I choose also to, try a different way of making people <span style="color:red" data-ts="1699.195" data-end_ts="1699.485" title="1699.195" id=c_"1699.195">__have__</span>, getting in contact with the software. I, I wanted to unify this with my music. I see that, that that was of course possible, and I think, necessary because my software are a way to support my artistic activity, you know, by equipment and make other software for people. You know, it's, it's something I share and something that helps me to make music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Got it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>It's, it's like, you know, and, and, if I make an album, I would like to not just only make a, an, an LP with the software, but to give people also pieces of sound to try to experiment at first. Right. That's, that's an idea. I want to share music and software, because in my point of view, they are, they are the same thing in a way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Let's talk a little bit about these documentaries that you did for, telling MTV, because it's clear to me that the process of putting those together really kind of influenced how you influenced the way that you became an artist, or, or changed. Maybe that's the way that you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>Became an artist. Yeah, yeah. That's true. Of course, because, what I wanted to make this documentaries had the chance, for example, to interview, pan or, Herman Sherman, the, the one from Sherman Filter Banks or, the guys at Jobox. And, of course, also at the end also <span style="color:red" data-ts="1801.025" data-end_ts="1801.225" title="1801.025" id=c_"1801.025">__Caroline__</span>, there was a one hour big interview at the end of the DVD Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, of course, all these experiences really had a huge impact on my music making and software making. So it was then that they became a single reality, two phases of the same thing. You know, I meet incredible persons. I met, you know, inventors. I have a deep love for their work, so I wanted to be an inventor in a way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Yeah. Well, it's, it's interesting because, you know, some of the people you talk about, whether it's the Sher, the inventor of the Sherman Filter Bank, or Panasonic, or <span style="color:red" data-ts="1847.465" data-end_ts="1847.705" title="1847.465" id=c_"1847.465">__Carl__</span>, Carl <span style="color:red" data-ts="1848.115" data-end_ts="1848.465" title="1848.115" id=c_"1848.115">__Heins__</span>, Stockhouse, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1849.165" data-end_ts="1849.385" title="1849.165" id=c_"1849.165">__and__</span> I can't imagine meeting them and not walking away with your brain changed a little bit. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>Oh, yeah. <laugh>, it's impossible not to be changed, you know? Right. Those days, I remember them very heartly because they, they were a very important part of my career. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, they, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1870.725" data-end_ts="1870.945" title="1870.725" id=c_"1870.725">__you__</span> know, I'm curious about how, how you got the opportunity to do this because <laugh>, you know, and, and what is the background that got you in a position to do that? 'cause it's clear that that sort of launched you in a direction. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>Yeah. Well, I started, all as a sound engineer in, in my experience, in my work. I had to work also with video at some point. I began using, editing stuff. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, editing software for video, also very, interesting equipment like, as the quantum IQ equipment, I'm talking <span style="color:red" data-ts="1910.765" data-end_ts="1910.985" title="1910.765" id=c_"1910.765">__of__</span> very professional cinema grade <span style="color:red" data-ts="1913.745" data-end_ts="1914.305" title="1913.745" id=c_"1913.745">__THX__</span> stuff. Right. And so I had a huge technical background with super professional equipment for cinema, for example, cinema, and I mean, postproduction audio, post-production and video production. Sure. For, for example, in 2004, we were working with 2K Technology, and it was like, you know, very huge, very big. It was incredible to have digital projectors, 2K in 2004 mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, once I, I got known this incredible equipment, incredible mixers and stuff. Of course, I had a pretty good idea how to use, create my stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>If I learn a language, to create my processors, my, filters my loopers. Right. So, so here, max MSP came in, it was around year 2000. That's, that's the main background. Then I had a musical background, but it was not institutional more, more with, private lessons Okay. With composers. I also did, assistant at composition because of course, my experience in 14 year experience with MaxMSP, put me in a position to know very well, real time electronic music. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, and also some stuff of, computer assisted composition with open music and P-V-P-W-G-L, for example. Right. So that's, that's basically my background. But of course, I did many jobs in the sound, industry, for example, advertising and, some movies and music, pop music. But, at the end, contemporary music has been, the most interesting field for me for many years of, of course, when I was very young in the nineties, I used to make drum bass music live with synthesizers and sequesters and stuff like that. But with the age, you know, after the twenties 25, then Kaline <span style="color:red" data-ts="2051.975" data-end_ts="2052.255" title="2051.975" id=c_"2051.975">__stock__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2052.255" data-end_ts="2052.495" title="2052.255" id=c_"2052.255">__cousin__</span> came in and all the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2053.855" data-end_ts="2054.055" title="2053.855" id=c_"2053.855">__best__</span>, you know, <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The rest goes away. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b><laugh>. Yeah. Because I, I always was, not very satisfactory with, with, with dance music, with the, the problem for me is that it has a very limited language in terms of rhythm. Right. And I wanted to break the chains of this sequential pattern ideas. So that's why I started programming, because I wanted stuff be alive of themselves. I love generative algorithmic experimental stuff. Right. Like, like live things, you know, that's <laugh>, that's the thing. Sure. Stein, you know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Right. It, it's interesting that, that, that you'd taken that approach and, and really to go from drum <span style="color:red" data-ts="2106.865" data-end_ts="2107.065" title="2106.865" id=c_"2106.865">__and__</span> bass to Desynchronized looping, washes is, is quite a, quite a jump. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>Well, I, I've been a, an 18 years old boy in the nineties, Uhhuh <affirmative>. So the nineties, you know, you remember we had, oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>There's a lot going on. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>Yeah. I, I've been using computers since 1982. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I was charting on, on, on the telephone with a modem and a Commodore 64 in 1987. So, the computers were really part of my life since my, my, my my child age. Right. And, in the nineties, the computers were kind of, powerful, but not that powerful. The internet was so slow, <laugh>, the CD break very easily. They were, I started hating CDs because all my CDs all day had these, scratches. Right. And they started glitching, of course. Right. And at some point, of course, I started getting interested in this noises. You see, at some point you realize, oh, this sound is beautiful. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>And of course, we had incredible artists such as Pan <span style="color:red" data-ts="2181.865" data-end_ts="2182.085" title="2181.865" id=c_"2181.865">__So__</span>, and Oval and Ec and, mic Staria and such, such as that. I mean, the glitch mo movement as been very important because I was raised in the nineties. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So, so kind of seeing, seeing the Glit, the Glitch type things move from something that made you angry into being something that was artwork. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>Yeah. Yeah. That's correct. From disappointment to excitation. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That's, that's a interesting point. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>Yeah. And that's a part of course, because, if you are into electronic music in, in the contemporary music scene, contemporary classical music scene, the timber is so important. It's so important to study new timbers, to create new sounds that, of course, glitching and creating data errors or using stuff, basically <span style="color:red" data-ts="2240.185" data-end_ts="2240.405" title="2240.185" id=c_"2240.185">__the__</span> the point is using stuff in a different way. Right. You know? Right. At that point, everything became useful to make stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Absolutely. Yeah. It's really, it, it's funny because sometimes it's, and, and I was in the middle of it, and it was a very important time for me too, but it's sometimes hard to remember a time where computers were not powerful enough to do audio. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. You know, it's hard to remember that now because it's been such a thing for over Yeah. You know, more than a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2272.605" data-end_ts="2272.685" title="2272.605" id=c_"2272.605">__decade__</span>. Well, I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>Remember, you know, I remember, oh my God, right. <laugh> those days bringing with me an Atari, with the CRT monitor, which was so heavy, you know, <laugh> and all the samplers. Right. You know, people, all the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2289.845" data-end_ts="2290.085" title="2289.845" id=c_"2289.845">__samplers__</span>, they, they have a computer with thousands of sampling samplers inside, and maybe they can have full polyphony and stuff like that. But in the nineties is what was, it was such a pain to do electronic music, you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Know, it actually really was. You're right. Yeah. It's, <laugh>. That's an interesting, background though, and I, I really appreciate where you're coming with that. Now, one of the things I'm curious about is, and I can't believe our, our time is already running short. I can't believe that, but whatever. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>That's great. That's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Great. Yeah. I am curious, in addition to, you know, doing the work on, on the next version of Glab, what else is in your future, what do you have going on and what is the stuff that's out there that excites you right now? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>Well, I have a pretty intense, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2345.235" data-end_ts="2345.525" title="2345.235" id=c_"2345.235">__life__</span> activity. For example, I was in Mexico, one, one week ago for a festival, for <span style="color:red" data-ts="2354.705" data-end_ts="2354.925" title="2354.705" id=c_"2354.705">__an__</span> electronic music festival in osi. And then I had a concert in Milan and one in Rome and one in Florence. And all these gigs were different, different technology, different ideas, different patches. Pretty much of my life is occupied by, live music concerts and, sometimes installations. I did a big installation here in Milan, in, in the Royal Palace, in, in Milan, close to Gu in, late spring. So, I have, you know, educational, job as a teacher of Max m SB sound design. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, actually, it's a kind of middle <span style="color:red" data-ts="2402.145" data-end_ts="2402.365" title="2402.145" id=c_"2402.145">__way__</span> between sound design class and, electroacoustic class. It's, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Where is <span style="color:red" data-ts="2408.075" data-end_ts="2408.365" title="2408.075" id=c_"2408.075">__this__</span> at? Where do you teach this? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>It's the CAA, college in Milan. And I've been teaching there since 19, 2001. 2001. So it's 14 years. So I've been teaching sentences, analog sentences. I was the one using modular in year 2000 in the school <laugh>. Everybody was looking at me like a freak, you know, <laugh>. I know, I know. Yeah. I was like, what, what's, what's this? You know, the people and, and, yeah. But nowadays it's normal nowadays. Oh, yeah. It's a synthesizer. Oh, yeah. It's a modular, but in the days in the, in the 2000 a modular synthesizer was like, what is, what is this Frankenstein stuff? You know? That's it. So I, I teach and I make live music, and in the spare time I make software <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. So, how do you, how do you get your gigs? What is it that, how, how do people learn about you and your work? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>Well, of course I have a website, which is my name.net <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. I'll put, I'll post up a link because Oh, thank you. Anyone who isn't already visiting there, I need to get 'em over there because they're so 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>Fascinating. Yeah. And, and, I can, I can suggest you, also, the website of Argon, which is, the Contemporary Music Center I work with, which is in Milan, which is an historical contemporary music center. We made electronic music of, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2501.005" data-end_ts="2501.285" title="2501.005" id=c_"2501.005">__Stok__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2501.475" data-end_ts="2501.765" title="2501.475" id=c_"2501.475">__with__</span> Stockhausen, Luc Burial, and, you know, all the important composers of electronic music in the last 70 years. And, the, the Center has been there since the early nineties and made, kind of 300 huge productions Oh, wow. With, with institutions such as, Lascala Theater, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2524.645" data-end_ts="2524.965" title="2524.645" id=c_"2524.645">__<inaudible>__</span>, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2525.525" data-end_ts="2525.765" title="2525.525" id=c_"2525.525">__stem__</span>, the EMS in, in Sweden, and the Living Theater in New York. So they made big, big, you know, electronic electroacoustic, programs there. And of course, they are specialized in, software programming like Max SBMP data or Super Collider. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So that's, that's my second home. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>And, we have very interesting artists with me, like, such as, for example, Pietro, we, who has, for example, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2561.725" data-end_ts="2561.845" title="2561.725" id=c_"2561.725">__a__</span>, the biggest laser harp ever, like 20 meter <laugh>. Oh my goodness. Laser. Yeah. Yeah. That's huge. And, that's, that's the way the people can know me mostly. Of course, I, I am known because of the softwares. And that was, very important for me to create, to help my, my artistic activity creating software for people. Right. So I help with people, and I, and I've been known for, for my software, and, and that's important. It's, it's, it's great because now people is asking me, of course, classes and concerts and stuff like that, you know? Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I think, I think that it's important too by, by doing, software development and putting it out there for people to use. But by doing that, it's, it's interesting because probably more than even a music release, people can understand who you are by looking at software that you've created. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>That's true. That's, that's why I sell them together, Uhhuh, <affirmative>, because the, the sounds I make are a part, right. Of the whole picture. The software I make is, is, is definitely, is for me, a little piece of heart, like music. It's, that's, that's the reason because I never make the same software over and over again with the same features. That's the reason why I don't have perfect schedules. That's the reason why, because I can be free of creating anything. It came in my mind. And That's funny. And people Exactly. Because I am giving them every time new tools. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>Right. And I tried, the, the most important thing for me when I started off with Maxim was to create stuff that it, it is not out there yet. Right. That is like very personal. Like, I'm creating my idea of this stream of music, and then of course, people can do whatever they want with it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Fabulous. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>So, so that's the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2696.045" data-end_ts="2696.245" title="2696.045" id=c_"2696.045">__why__</span>, that's why they are together. Exactly. I think they are the same thing, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Good point. Yeah, they, right. They're, they're your artistic output. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>Yeah, yeah. Yeah. That's, that's correct. That's correct. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, Giorgio, I, this has been a fantastic and illuminating, discussion. I appreciate you spending the time. I have a question that I sometime like to ask people and I'm gonna ask you, which is, or if you met an 18-year-old version of yourself, what would you, what would you tell that person in order to help them either do better work or have less problems? <laugh>, or what would, how would you help that person 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b><laugh>? Well, we're talking about, a career thing, or I don't, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I don't <span style="color:red" data-ts="2743.725" data-end_ts="2743.805" title="2743.725" id=c_"2743.725">__know__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2743.975" data-end_ts="2744.325" title="2743.975" id=c_"2743.975">__maybe__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>Well, the first thing I would like to say to myself in, in the past is please study c plus plus 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>Please. I beg you, <laugh>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2755.985" data-end_ts="2756.205" title="2755.985" id=c_"2755.985">__And__</span> the second thing, I think, well, I dunno, if I, if I could do my life back again, of course I would like to have also, traditional music education. I mean, like cell. I mean, I know how to play the bass. I've been playing bass for so many years, but I cannot myself, I cannot call myself a torso over an acoustic instruments. Sure. I miss this. I think I would like to say, please have c plus plus and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2787.505" data-end_ts="2787.785" title="2787.505" id=c_"2787.505">__cell__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Giorgio: </b>Right. That's, that's my idea. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's awesome. Well, Giorgio, thank you so much for your time. Thanks. It's been fantastic. It's fantastic. I look forward to us talking again soon. 
</p>
