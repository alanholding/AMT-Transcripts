<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. This week, I have a very special guest and one that came to me through kind of an interesting way. Robert Mathson is a phenomenal basis, and one that does sort of, solo electroacoustic performance and recording with the bass. Robert reached out to me and said, Hey, sometime if you're interested in, the kind of stuff I'm doing, I'd love to talk to you. And an opening came up this weekend. So I took the opportunity to snag him. He was kind enough to share <span style="color:red" data-ts="39.6" data-end_ts="39.72" title="39.6" id=c_"39.6">__a__</span>, a copy of his latest recording with me, and I was blown away. Now, some of that is because I'm an absolute sucker for the bass. I think acoustic bass is one of the most beautiful instruments created by man. But I also, love the idea of solo <span style="color:red" data-ts="57.07" data-end_ts="57.36" title="57.07" id=c_"57.07">__base__</span>, which is kind of a rarity, and also one that uses computer enhancement and computer, augmentation, which is even more rare. And so the more I listened and the more I was getting into it, the more I more anxious and excited I was to talk to Robert. So with that, I'll introduce you to Robert Matheson Hey, Robert. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert Matheson: </b>Hey, Darwin Doing well. Thanks. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>As I said, <span style="color:red" data-ts="81.4" data-end_ts="81.52" title="81.4" id=c_"81.4">__a__</span> phenomenal, cd. That thing is pretty, pretty wonderful. Why don't you kind of fill people in on, on what you do <span style="color:red" data-ts="90.54" data-end_ts="90.76" title="90.54" id=c_"90.54">__and__</span>, you know, things like, performances, recent performances as well as this, and any other recorded work you might have? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Yeah, with my, with my electroacoustic work, I, I play, like you said, solo double bass, with augmented electronics on with it. I, have a pickup that I made for the base that turns each of the strings through pitch to MIDI recognition. It turns each of the strings into a MIDI controller. So while I'm playing on the bass, I have control over all the electroacoustic aspects of the music too. So that's, I also use some other sensors. I've got a, a piece of Velcro on the underside of the fingerboard that I stick a a wee mote to sometimes when I play. And I use that for controlling. And so that's, that's kind of how I, I do my stuff. I use a pedal board to switch from, from diff one setup, like one patch to another. And that's, that's how I approach my solo performing 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, as my introduction sort of like stated, doing solo double <span style="color:red" data-ts="159.31" data-end_ts="159.6" title="159.31" id=c_"159.31">__base__</span> is kind of a rarity anyway. Yeah. But then also doing one with computer augmentation is kind of, is getting pretty close to absolutely unique Right. <laugh>. Yeah. How did you get, one, one of the sticks I do in my podcast is I ask people how they've gotten to become the, the artists that they are. This is particularly a good one to ask you because, you've chosen such a unique path, to do your musical work. How did you, how did you get to what you're doing today? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Oh, well, as far as, like playing the bass and everything, I started when I was about 13 years old. I started playing bass guitar. My, my brother, he was off at college and he was learning how to play guitar. And, I wanted to hang out with him a little more. So I said, yeah, I want to be like you. I want <span style="color:red" data-ts="211.96" data-end_ts="212.08" title="211.96" id=c_"211.96">__to__</span> play guitar. And he said, well, I play guitar. My friend here plays the guitar. Our other friend plays the drums. We need someone to play bass <laugh>. So that's how I, I first started playing bass was on that. And then, you know, as I started playing more and listening more to bass players and actually finding out what, you know, what the bass can do, I, got really interested. That was when, pork soda came out by Primus. And I heard Les Claypool's playing and got to go see him play. And I thought, man, that's amazing. I can't believe you can do that on the base. And between his playing and, and hearing Jocko Pastorius, I thought, okay, I'm gonna rip the frets outta my base. <laugh> <laugh>. So I went back to my, my dad's garage and I ripped all the frets out and filled it with epoxy. And so I, that was when I first started playing Fretless 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>And, and then, so I, I played on that bass for a few years. I even at one point, you know, started routing, routed out a hole in it, and I stuck a, it was a J <span style="color:red" data-ts="274.71" data-end_ts="274.95" title="274.71" id=c_"274.71">__bass__</span> copy, and I put a, a pase pickup in it to see how that would change the sound of it. And, then, my senior year in high school, I, I picked up a double bass and started playing that. 'cause I had been listening to a lot of jazz recordings, mainly like Charles Mingus and Charlie Hayden. And just loved their sound and thought, well, this isn't something I can get on the electric base. I need to, switch over to the double base and add that to my, to my abilities. And so I really fell in love with that, my, my senior year in high school. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>And, then, when I went off to school, I went to uc, Santa Cruz, up in Northern California. Sure. For my first couple of years. And, I started studying with Barry Green. He had, he had just retired from the Cincinnati Symphony and retired out to California and started teaching there. So I showed up at his office and said, Hey, I wanna, I've only been playing for a year, but I want to take lessons from you. And he took me into a studio, taught me how to play, play with the bow. And I just, again, fell in love with the bass even more with that, that you, you have so, so much more control over the tone and the sound of the bass when you're playing with the bow than <span style="color:red" data-ts="354.13" data-end_ts="354.35" title="354.13" id=c_"354.13">__you__</span>, I feel that you do with simply Pizzicato. 'cause, 'cause you have control after the attack as well. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>So I, I really, I spent a lot of time just practicing with the bow and learning how to play the bass. My, as far as like adding my electroacoustic background to it, I, while I was at uc, Santa Cruz, there's a class there that Gordon <span style="color:red" data-ts="379.98" data-end_ts="380.2" title="379.98" id=c_"379.98">__Mua__</span> teaches. And I had, I had no idea who he was before I took the class. <laugh> <laugh>. But like, you know, I look back and I was like, oh man, I was, I, that happened a few times. And with him teaching that class, it was, I was introduced to the, you know, the great electroacoustic music of, of the 20th century. You know, I, I went back a, a couple months ago and I was looking at the syllabus for it 'cause I, I hold onto all that stuff. Sure. And, and we were, that was the first time I had ever listened to any John Cage, listening to Williams Mix in there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>And then, and, <span style="color:red" data-ts="415.66" data-end_ts="416.08" title="415.66" id=c_"415.66">__Barrio__</span> and, and, Lucier is, I'm sitting in a room really, like, hit home with me. I just loved the, the process music aspect of that. And so that was, that was my first introduction to electronic music. And if, like, like most 18 year olds, I was probably like, what is this <laugh> it. I didn't really understand it at first, but I, you know, it stuck in my mind. And then, I I, at that, after a couple years there, I switched down to Cal State Long Beach to do, finish up my undergrad there. And I've, I've all my degrees are in base performance. I've the, so I went down there and I studied with Dave Young, who's principal of the LA Opera mm-hmm. <affirmative> and focused primarily on, on orchestra and solo playing there. I, I really <span style="color:red" data-ts="476.59" data-end_ts="476.88" title="476.59" id=c_"476.59">__like__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="477.11" data-end_ts="477.4" title="477.11" id=c_"477.11">__like__</span> the sound of solo bass playing my first albums of like bass music that I, double bass music that I ever bought were by, Robert Black and, his recording of Failing by John D. Have you ever heard that one? No, I haven't. It's, it's a pretty awesome piece. It's fun. You, you talk and you play at the same time. And the text in the piece is all about how it's really hard to talk and play at the same time. <laugh>, and I'm probably failing as I'm doing this 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b><laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>It's, it's a really cool piece to hear his recording of it. I recommend checking it out. And, there, Bert Tourette's recorded it too, and I, that was the first solo bass music I ever heard <laugh>. Right. And after hearing that, and I saw Bert Tosky, who's a big kind of avant-garde bassist <span style="color:red" data-ts="527.84" data-end_ts="528.08" title="527.84" id=c_"527.84">__outta__</span> San that used to teach at San Diego. I, so I got to hear him play with Vinny Golia up in San Francisco while I was in, in Santa Cruz. Sure. And, I, that kind of, I think that had an, an interesting effect on my perception of what the, so <span style="color:red" data-ts="545.31" data-end_ts="545.6" title="545.31" id=c_"545.31">__bass__</span> is <laugh> and then mixed that together with, hearing Francois Robots recordings. And I, he's a bass player from, from Syria originally, but he is out of France, and he's one of the, kind of most controversial, in a way, pedagogues on the base of the last a hundred years. He came up with some new different techniques of, with approaching the <span style="color:red" data-ts="568.48" data-end_ts="568.72" title="568.48" id=c_"568.48">__base__</span> that, really make it more of a soloistic instrument. So I got, I got to hear him playing, got to take some master classes with him through Barry Green and his base camp up in Northern California. And so that's between, you know, his playing and the Avantgarde music that I was hearing. I think that really formed my perception of what the bass is and what it can do as a solo instrument. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That's really interesting. And, and quite a fascinating, road to, to get there. Now, in your current playing work, what are the tools that you use other than obviously the double bass? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Yeah. Well, I, I use, I've got my base, I've got a, a microphone attached to it. So that takes the acoustic sound into, into my setup. And then, I've got a, a polyphonic pickup that I made and installed in my bridge where there's a, a separate pickup for each string. Right. A lot like, like the graph tech kind of ones or whatever that the guitarists use. Right. So I just embedded it down in the bridge, and then that goes out through a, a ghost, preamp that, that filters out a lot of the overtones, leaving the fundamental pitches. And then that goes off and I'm using an Axon AX 50, pitch to mid converter. Sure. They, when I was at, I went to the U of A from grad school, and while I was there, my working on my doctorate, I, I was studying electronic music with the percussion professor there, Weinberg Dr. Weinberg there. And he, he encouraged me with this project of making a MIDI controller for the <span style="color:red" data-ts="674.84" data-end_ts="675.04" title="674.84" id=c_"674.84">__base__</span>. Right. And so I was researching it, and the, of all the, the pitch to midi, you know, directions that you can take, the, the Axon one looked like it was the one that would work best for what I was doing. So I, I sent them a letter actually to syn ax who was, distributing at the time. They don't, they don't even make, axon doesn't even make that stuff. <span style="color:red" data-ts="696.7" data-end_ts="696.92" title="696.7" id=c_"696.7">__No__</span>. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I know. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>So I, I'm gonna have to find some other way to do this at some point, <laugh>. But, so I sent them a letter and a recommendation letter from, from a couple of my teachers about the project I was doing. And they sent me one and said, here, give it a try. I'd like to see what, what you're gonna do with this <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>So I started, so I run the sound through that. And then to, to my laptop. And I run that through first, pure data to adjust the pitches and I mean the, the numbers. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>And then, mostly for the, the pitch bend and for the, for the after touch, I, I like to be able to kind of have control over those. Sure. And then I run that, into Ableton Live. And I've, I've used different, I've used reason as well in the past for, primarily just for the sampler on it, the, the N N X T on that. And, but once I found out that I could use the sampler instrument on live, I started using that. And that way everything just runs in pretty much <span style="color:red" data-ts="763" data-end_ts="763.16" title="763" id=c_"763">__into__</span> one program. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I was gonna say, and listening to your album, it seems like one of the things that you do to really fill out the sound is that you take advantage of, you kind of do a lot of real time looping. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And, that, you know, I have a tendency to do that as well, and Ableton makes it so convenient. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>It 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="785.84" data-end_ts="786.08" title="785.84" id=c_"785.84">__Does__</span>. It's really kind of hard to imagine doing, you know, especially when, 'cause I've used, I've used looping pedals and stuff in the past, but the convenience of having kind of an unlimited number of tracks that you can kind of like blow loops into is pretty compelling. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Yeah. Yeah. And to be able to, I've used, sometimes I use Super Looper as a plugin in it, it that, you know, takes up more of the computer's, processor to do that. Right. Sometimes I use the Built-in Looper that's, that's in Ableton. I, I like the way they both work. They both have, you know, positives to them. Yeah. The Ableton one with just how easy it is to, to use and super looper. I like how you can have, you know, three different loopers running and have 'em all sync together. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Now, I'm curious about, your use of the Axon. Yeah. I'm a, I'm a long <span style="color:red" data-ts="843.44" data-end_ts="843.64" title="843.44" id=c_"843.44">__time__</span> guitar player. That was actually what I went to school and, but I was fascinated with, with MIDI guitar. But, over the years I tried all the different systems and I have to admit that the Axon was, I would say head and shoulders, the, the best that I had tried. But yeah. They, they just kind of disappeared. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Yeah. I, I was kind of sad to find out, and it was probably a year or so after it disappeared. I had, when they sent me the unit, they were going to sell it to me at a discounted price for being a student and doing this project and stuff. And it came like a couple days before Christmas. And, I started, I started using it and everything. I was playing with it and I played a couple of recitals with it. And I, I was thinking, I haven't paid for this thing yet. What's going on, <laugh>? So I wrote the, the guy from the, from Syntax about it that, you know, I, where do I send a check? How much do I owe you? And he wrote me back. I sent <span style="color:red" data-ts="905.48" data-end_ts="905.64" title="905.48" id=c_"905.48">__him__</span> some videos of what I'd done. Right. He wrote me back and he said, oh, we're not distributed anymore. Enjoy. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Geez. Unreal. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>It <span style="color:red" data-ts="912.2" data-end_ts="912.32" title="912.2" id=c_"912.2">__was__</span>, that was awesome. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, happy holidays, <laugh>. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Exactly. So, but yeah, I've tried, maybe it's because I don't, I could probably spend more time on it and figure out how to do it through, through pd Right. Or, or with Max. But I haven't, really taken the time to figure out how to make that work. A lot of the, the pitch recognition in that, whether it's Helm Holts or, or Sigmund, I think is the other one that I've used. Yeah. Yeah. They tend to like, bottom out around 50 or 55 hertz, I think. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's funny because, I've used that stuff. One of the people I've been helping out lately is <span style="color:red" data-ts="950.12" data-end_ts="950.36" title="950.12" id=c_"950.12">__Dean__</span> Ulka, who has one of those old zeta violins. Oh, yeah. With the individual pickups on that. And, just like you have problems at the low end, a lot of those systems really have problems at the high end as well. So all of a sudden, as soon as she'd get, <span style="color:red" data-ts="968.98" data-end_ts="969.2" title="968.98" id=c_"968.98">__and__</span> even a medium register on the high string of the violin was like freaking most of the pitch followers all man. Pretty godly. Yeah. Which is unfortunate, but, you know, I, I guess that just shows that there's still work for technologists to do. Right. <laugh>. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Yeah. I, I would love it if there was somebody who, could use the same, you know, pitch detection idea that they use on the Axon and make a, a piece of software. Right. Just make a plugin for that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="998.9" data-end_ts="999.12" title="998.9" id=c_"998.9">__The__</span>, so the pickup that you, you actually made your own pickup for the base? Yeah. I mean, are you, did you literally like whine coils and stuff, or did you No, it's sort of hack an existing one. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>It's a pizo pickup. I just bought raw discs. Okay. Little nine millimeter, or nine and a half or whatever, millimeter discs. And, I took my bridge over to a friend's table saw, and I'd made a jig for it, <laugh> and I, I stuck it in the jig and, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright. This, I'm seeing this fall apart already. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b><laugh> well, I had, I've got a lot of background in woodworking, so I had a little bit of confidence in it, but I still didn't know if it was gonna work <laugh>. Right. So I, I did it on a, on an electric upright bass that I had made, years before. And I, I've, I've made a few basses. I've made two bass guitars and an electric upright bass. And so, and I make my own pickups for my basses as well. I see. Just from <span style="color:red" data-ts="1056.54" data-end_ts="1056.76" title="1056.54" id=c_"1056.54">__raw__</span> pazo discs and mount, you know, sandwiching 'em in, in maple and, and using that. So I, I took the bridge and I put it in the, in the, the jig and cut it through slice the, just like a saddle slot on the top end of the bridge. Yeah. Yeah. And then, fit the, I use a, a cap five cable going up to the pickups to the discs and have those, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1084.82" data-end_ts="1085.04" title="1084.82" id=c_"1084.82">__in__</span>, embedded down into it with saddle with an individual saddle under each bridge. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, that's, that's phenomenal. So how, how good is the string to string rejection? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>It's pretty good. I can play, you know, depending on which technique I'm using, I can play pretty quiet and it'll still respond to it. And I can play up to about, like forte and, and still have independence between the strings. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Wow. That's, that's cool. And you know, I think this is one of those, yet another one of those cases where, sort of being the maker of your own, at least to some extent, the maker of your own gear really allows you to experiment a lot. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Yeah. Well, the, that first one that I made, I put it on electric, on my electric upright. And at that point, I, I wasn't using it much. I was playing mostly, classical and jazz gigs and, you know, going for a more traditional sound. Right. And so the battery on the preamp was dead and everything, so I was doing <laugh>. I didn't even, and some of the wires had sorted out inside of it. So I thought, well, I don't want to fix that right now. I'm just going to, and I'm just doing purely electronic music on it. So all it was was a mid controller for the first year or so <laugh>. Sure, sure. And so I was making just pure electroacoustic music on it. And, yeah. It, after I got that working and I was comfortable with it and I really liked it, I, I thought, okay, I gotta do this on my, on my acoustic base. Right. So I, I got bought another bridge and I, and fit it to the instrument and, put all the pickups in it and everything. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="1186.72" data-end_ts="1186.84" title="1186.72" id=c_"1186.72">__I__</span>, that's what I use primarily. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. Do you ever play a standard electric or do you just do everything upright now? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>I play, I still play bass guitar as well. I, I play in a pit orchestra out here. There's a, an outdoor, amphitheater that does, like six months out of the year does Broadway shows. Okay. So I, I do a couple shows a summer out there, and so I'll double on electric and on upright for those. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. But out there, we should let people know. Oh, sorry. You <laugh>. No, you, you are located in Utah in St. George, Utah, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Yeah, St. George. I, I teach at Dixie State University here. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What do you teach? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>I teach, orig base, double <span style="color:red" data-ts="1228.88" data-end_ts="1229.16" title="1228.88" id=c_"1228.88">__base__</span> lessons. I teach music, it's music technology class. Okay. Here, that's like an intro to music technology for, primarily for music majors. Sure. And, then I teach Intro to Music classes, which was is like a, a gen ed course and theory and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1245.16" data-end_ts="1245.32" title="1245.16" id=c_"1245.16">__ear__</span> training. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Now, one of the things that you talked about just a minute ago was how you were using this one instrument purely for electro-acoustic stuff. And, I think that that's a phrase that for people that know it, right, it means everything. You know, they know exactly what that means for practically everybody else. That sounds like a genre that they don't know what it is. So, could you explain, could you explain to people that might not know, what sort of the canon of electroacoustic is? Could you explain that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Yeah, I, you're right. There are, there's like a whole history of things that's associated with that term when you use it more than just the, the sound comes from electronics. Right. But <span style="color:red" data-ts="1295.96" data-end_ts="1296.16" title="1295.96" id=c_"1295.96">__that__</span> it's, you know, I usually look at electroacoustic music is going back to the Shafer's, to Pierre Schafer in France, for the music re side of things. And then coming out of Germany, the electronics music, that was, that was in the forties that, that you had these kind of two schools developing. By the time you get into the, into the fifties and especially the mid fifties, it's, you know, it's, it was primarily <span style="color:red" data-ts="1325.2" data-end_ts="1325.36" title="1325.2" id=c_"1325.2">__in__</span> an experimental style of music. The composers that I think of first off in the fifties that really, took these two schools and put 'em together, of course you've got Carl Heinz Stockhausen, with his Song of the Youth and, and Williams <span style="color:red" data-ts="1345.05" data-end_ts="1345.4" title="1345.05" id=c_"1345.05">__mixed__</span> by John Cage. Those, these composers who were combining music, concrete, this idea of recording existing sounds and then manipulating them to create a, a piece of music. Combining that with electronically generated sounds. So yeah, that's kind of the, the beginnings of it. And it's, it is a very experimental style of music. The, in the other composers in the sixties that I kind of, that I think of for that Steve Reich with his, with his phase, his early phase pieces. Right. Like I the, come out and it's gonna rain. Yeah. It's gonna 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Rain. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Yeah. Those are are big, kind of parts of the, the music concrete tradition into the US into experimentalism and minimalism here in the us. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. What's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1400.52" data-end_ts="1400.68" title="1400.52" id=c_"1400.52">__inter__</span> what's interesting to me is now like in, you know, after, I would say after 2000, let's say, let's use that as a marker mm-hmm. <affirmative>, after the year 2000, I, I would say what I, what I noticed is that people who identified as doing electroacoustic music often identified it as music that started off on an acoustic instrument and then had electronic augmentation to it. And, and given some of the things you just talked about that is, hasn't always been the case. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Right? Yeah. I, I guess the, you know, most of, like with Seamus, society for Electroacoustic music, and, you know, the definition that they use is that it's anything that has, an electronic generated sound. Right. That's where the acoustic aspect of the piece comes from is from electronics. But yeah, this, the mixture of, of acoustic instrument with electronics. I, I've done a, I had done a few, this kind of goes into why I started doing the midi <span style="color:red" data-ts="1475.93" data-end_ts="1476.09" title="1475.93" id=c_"1475.93">__bass__</span> stuff too. So I had played a few bass and tape pieces. Yeah. And, and like, Frank Protos, death of Des is a, is a great one, where he, he wrote that in the, I think the mid or late eighties where he recorded all these sounds from the bass onto a, onto a hardware sampler, and then manipulated them and stuff and created the tape part of it. And it, I love the sound of the pieces and, but I never liked that everything was strict to the tape. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>That you have to follow the tape and you've gotta have the score in front of you. And you know that when you hear this little b it's like, okay, that means I've gotta be playing this note right after it <laugh>. Right. And everything has to be just wind up perfectly. And there wasn't much of an improvisation, improvisational aspect to it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and there's also, there's also what I, I kind of think of as like the ghost performer, ghost performers, which is, you know, you're standing on stage and 17 things are coming out and people are like, okay, I see where one of 'em coming from. Where's the rest coming from? Yeah. You know, it was actually even worse in the earlier days of like tape music and stuff where the composer would have to stand up in front of the audience and like, turn on the tape recorder, press, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Press, play. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. <laugh> plus, plus play, and then kind of stand off to the side while the reel to reel deck was doing the performance. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Yeah. There, I read an interview with Jacob Druckman years ago where he was, he said, there's nothing more 80 19 84 ish <laugh> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1572.81" data-end_ts="1573.01" title="1572.81" id=c_"1572.81">__than__</span> sitting in a darkened room with nothing but a pair of speakers on the stage. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. Exactly. It's a little creepy. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. So, for you, how much, how much live performance of, of your electroacoustic kind of experimental stuff do you do? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>I, you know, most of the stuff that I've done has been, like I've done faculty recitals here at Dixie State. My, when I was doing solo recitals for in school, I finished grad school in, graduated in 2012 from the University of Arizona. And I always, the last, few recitals I did there, I found a way to work my midi <span style="color:red" data-ts="1613.48" data-end_ts="1613.68" title="1613.48" id=c_"1613.48">__base__</span> pieces into my recitals there. Sure. And, you know, so I had my normal standard repertoire that you, that you've gotta play for the recital. You know, here's my classical and my baroque piece and my romantic. And then I'd put that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1626.56" data-end_ts="1626.76" title="1626.56" id=c_"1626.56">__at__</span>, kind of tag it on at the end. And, you know, the faculty on my, on my, juries, they were always like, you're one of 'em, came backstage afterwards and said, you're the weirdest guy I've ever met <laugh>. I said, thank you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, right. Exactly. That's right. There's two ways you could go. You could either like punch him in the neck Right. <laugh>, or just say thank you and smile. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b><laugh>. So I started working it into that, and I, I try to do, you know, right now I've been doing, doing that, I've, I've performed a few times with some dancers as well, who are on faculty here at Dixie State, who've listened to my recordings and, and said, oh, I like this piece. Can I, can I dance to the, to the recording of it? And I said, sure, but I can come in and play with you too, <laugh>. Sure, sure. And so that makes it a much more, a better experience. But right now I'm, you know, the last I've gotten my setup to where it's pretty portable and comfortable, so I'm looking to set up more, performances outside of kind of my little bubble <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Now you said that, in addition to the midi, so first of all, this midi connection you have through the Axon box, are you doing a lot of stuff where you're using the MIDI to drive sampled instruments? Or is it mostly like controller and, in like using it to influence other playback? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Right. Yeah, I, a lot of it I'm using to trigger, concrete sounds that I recorded myself. Got it. So I'll, here in St. George we're, I'm less than an hour away from, from Zion, from Zion National Park. Right. And that's one of my favorite places in the world. My family and, my wife and kids, we, we all go out there at least once a month. And so I, I've gone out there with my, my little Zoom recorder and recorded the river and recorded all the sounds out there, found a cool gnarled up log out there that I, I put contact mics on and plucked all over the place. And so I, I like to find my own sounds and then bring 'em back to the studio and, and kind of edit them and manipulate 'em a bit so that I can play those through the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1764.68" data-end_ts="1764.88" title="1764.68" id=c_"1764.68">__base__</span>. So I do a lot of that. I'll, well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Actually, actually, like three of the tracks on that day's end album, are titled Zion Landscapes. Is that where <span style="color:red" data-ts="1776.42" data-end_ts="1776.64" title="1776.42" id=c_"1776.42">__the__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1776.64" data-end_ts="1776.88" title="1776.64" id=c_"1776.64">__Yeah__</span>, that came from? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Yeah. All three of those, those movements come from Zion. Ah, okay. So Big Bend is, is one of the places there, it's actually the place where you get off if you don't want to be around anybody, <laugh> <laugh>, because it's like, it's all it is is a big bend in the river. And so I I, we went out there and had a picnic one day, and I recorded the river and I recorded the rocks and I had my kids throwing rocks in, into the river and on other rocks and on the sand. And I recorded all that and then used those samples for that one. Another one's, based on Sounds From Weeping Rock, which is one of the, another one of the spots there where water kind of seeps out of the rock over a little overhang and falls down. And we went there on Christmas Day a couple years ago, and it was all frozen over and dripping, and it was beautiful. And so I got the recorder out and I recorded the sound of all the water dripping off of that, off of the icicles and icicles falling and stuff. And then the, another one was based on Sounds from Checkerboard Mesa. That's where I found the, the log that I, that I sample out there. See. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>All right. Sure. Because, those are particularly beautiful and haunting and, and so it, it's clear that it was coming from someplace that was really special to you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Oh, thanks. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So, in addition, so you, you use the MIDI pickup then to fire those samples and stuff off? Yeah. Do you have just like a sample map and Ableton sampler or something like that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>I do, yeah. I just, I map it out to, to the spots on the, on the fingerboard where I want it to play. So I've got four samplers running at once. Oh, okay. In there, one for each string, of course, that way like the a on the G string, you know, I might be playing an A two on one string and playing a two on another string, and I can have different samples associated. Ah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Of course. That makes a lot of sense. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>So I do that, and then a lot of times I use, I assign pitch bend to panning, so that I can pan left or right depending on whether I GLIs down or gliss up with it. I'll, or along with just using regular pitch bend, some of the stuff I'll, I'll assign the, the channel pressure, which is the, the amp, the continuous amplitude of the string. Right. I'll, I'll, sometimes I'll assign that to a parameter, like to a delay pedal or to a delay plugin. That way as, as the string decays, the delay becomes faster. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. Now, you also said that you use a pedal board. What is the pedal board doing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Yeah, I've, I've got an old, a soft step that I use. It's not old. Nothing's old. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, <laugh>. But also like the best of the foot controllers. I love that thing. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>I love it. It's, I was using a, another one before that, and it, I was, you know, it got me started with using a pedal board and everything, but it would have do like double triggers and stuff. And I, so I, I borrowed this one from a, an organist friend of mine here in town in St. George, and he, he said, yeah, I bought it and I really don't use it much. So I bought it from him and I started using it. And it's, I love the, it's got all the, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1973.22" data-end_ts="1973.44" title="1973.22" id=c_"1973.22">__the__</span> touch sensitivity to the pedals and everything, and it's just, it works really cleanly. Right. And it fits in my bag. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, there you go. Yeah. Now you also said that you have a wee, wee moat that you like slap on the back of the neck. Now I have this history with the Wee Moat, and, I did like, I did a lot of crap in order to have one of the first recordings of a We Based performance. And it was, it was junk. It was, it was like me waving it around just to prove I could wave it around. But, it, it remained fascinating to me because there were these, it was kind of peculiar in the way that it would sense things, especially, I like the way that it dealt with subtle movement because it was, it was sort of somewhere between intention and noise mm-hmm. <affirmative> that was actually kind of fun to work with. But I'm wondering how do you use how to use it? And again, on your album, you've got something called, you have a track called Wewa. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Which I assumed was a, we a Wiimote extravaganza. And you know, you were using it in that to sort of like do what initially almost sounded like an auto <span style="color:red" data-ts="2053.11" data-end_ts="2053.4" title="2053.11" id=c_"2053.11">__walk__</span> kind of a thing. But then you started <span style="color:red" data-ts="2055.56" data-end_ts="2055.68" title="2055.56" id=c_"2055.56">__a__</span> sort of like, you know, clearly managing it during the playback. How are you, so I'm trying to imagine on an upright base, if you had one there, what is it that you're doing to generate enough data out of it to be useful? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Well, you know, one thing that's kind of cool, but also like at first was kind of frustrating is that, like you were saying, like the small motions that really senses that stuff. And so since it's attached to the base and the frequencies are so low <laugh> Right. That when you play a low note, it senses that and that's what creates that Ottawa sound. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Oh, I hadn't even thought about that. But of course, you play the low note and that's literally gonna be detectable movement. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>It is, yeah. So it shake, it feels that motion. And so it gives it that, that Ottawa kind really quick fluttery sound to it. But then as I, I move it forward, I have <span style="color:red" data-ts="2110.96" data-end_ts="2111.08" title="2110.96" id=c_"2110.96">__it__</span> usually assigned a forward and back, like, forward is pedaled down, like for a walk Sure. And then back is up. Right. And so I've, and I've got that just going through, an EQ eight in Ableton. Right. So I just assign it to one of the, one of the bands and crank it all the way up and make the cue kind of tight on it. And then that, I just pan that up and down with that for the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2132.9" data-end_ts="2133.12" title="2132.9" id=c_"2132.9">__was__</span> sound. And then, left and right with the base is left and right panning Uhhuh <affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, that's cool. That's really, that's really sharp. But also, a really neat, a again, sort of a cool hacky way of doing something that you would never sort of like design in the first place. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Yeah. Well, I had looked into, oh, like different sensors that you can buy and mount on instruments, you know, and, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2162.7" data-end_ts="2162.92" title="2162.7" id=c_"2162.7">__and__</span> at the moment, I'm forgetting the, you know, main companies that put those out, but like raw accelerometers. Right. And I, I looked at those and they're, you know, you're looking at a hundred bucks to put together a system for that <laugh>. Yeah, exactly. And I found a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2178.59" data-end_ts="2178.88" title="2178.59" id=c_"2178.59">__WiMo__</span> for like 15 bucks at a bookstore. <laugh>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2182.24" data-end_ts="2182.36" title="2182.24" id=c_"2182.24">__I__</span> used one there at a used bookstore. I was like, cool, I'll buy this. And so I, I just run it through, through oscillator and, yeah. Through that. And then I run that, that signal through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data">PD</a> and through Pure Data, so I can adjust to Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Clean, clean up the signal and stuff. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Yeah. 'cause if, if you use it just as it is, you've gotta turn the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2204.15" data-end_ts="2204.44" title="2204.15" id=c_"2204.15">__wemo__</span> 90 degrees each direction to get a full pan. Yep. So I, I run it through that and just run it through an equation <span style="color:red" data-ts="2211.34" data-end_ts="2211.56" title="2211.34" id=c_"2211.34">__in__</span>, in Pure data so that the way I hold the base comfortably is neutral, and then my comfortable motions are are full on up, down, left. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So, I, I like hearing the fact that you've kind of got, pure data in this position of being a kind of part of the interface between your instrument and, the elect the, software. Because I tend to think that that's one of, one of the things that particularly visual programming environments happen to be really good at. They're really good at being system glue because, because first of all, they're kind of easy to work with, but secondly, there's this sense that when you're putting together, when you're gluing a system together in this way, right? You've got a bunch of different, controllers that you're trying to bring all together and then use 'em sensibly in some software. There's this sense that, okay, I can get it in there, but the numbers can't be intellectualized. I have to kinda like put the system together and kind of be tweaking numbers until I find the sweet spot. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And that's where sort of the lack of having to do like compiling and all this kind of other stuff makes visual programming environments really, really pretty flexible. But it's still programming. And for a lot of people who are primary, primarily musicians, instrumentalists like yourself mm-hmm. <affirmative>, there's such a, there's such a, a, a moat to get over <laugh>. You know, there's such a gap to try and get to from between being I'm a musician and I'm going to be a, at least a hack capable programmer. How did you get over that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>I, you know, I just really wanted to do it <laugh>. Right. I had a, a professor at the U of A at the University of Arizona, Dr. Norm Weinberg there, who's, he's the per head of the percussion department, but he also has, he wrote one of the first books on midi, back in the mid eighties. And, and he agreed to do, an independent study with me when I first started back from my doctorate there. I, I had wanted to do, a minor in electronic music, but they didn't have one. So, but they did have like a way that you could make your own minor. Right. And so I, I wrote up a proposal, got him to be on, on my board, and then the electroacoustic, composition professor there, doc, Craig Walsh. And, so I put this together and got it through the committee. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>And so I, one of the classes, you know, quote classes that I took was, was an independent study with him where, I just met with him every week and he'd introduced me to another piece of software. And so that's how I found about Ableton, that's how I found out about reason was from him, he, you know, said, Hey, go get the 30 day trial of Max and Max M S P and try that out. So I tried that out and started to really like it and got to understand it doing the tutorials. But as a student, and, you know, money's tight and everything, so he, a couple weeks later, he said he had come back from a conference and he said, you gotta check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data">PD</a> <laugh>. Right. It's, you know, it, it's kind of like Max, it's a little bit different, but it's, you know, very similar and it, and it's free <laugh>. So I, I got that and I started working with it, and I just, you just kinda have to, if I'll go into it with an idea that I, of what I want and how I'm gonna approach it step by step, and then I just have to do lots of searching and using the help function on it to find out how am I gonna make this work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I think it's important for, for us to talk about not being entranced by programming as a thing for its own sake. Right. I think a lot of programmers get into the programming part of it and lose the focus that other people might have, which is that this is a tool to help me perform. Instead it becomes like, programming is the art form for its own sake. So I'm really encouraged to hear about someone who's, who takes the approach of like, this is a tool that I'm gonna use. I'm not gonna fall in love with the tool. I'm gonna maintain my, my focus as a performer, but I'm gonna find a way to crack this, you know, to, to crack the knot on doing what programming is necessary. Yeah. What is advice that you would give people who wanted to kind of take a similar path to yours? And I, I ask this because, I've, over the last couple of months I've talked to a couple of other people that kind of attempt to interface electronics with, with acoustic instrumentation. And there's a lot of, there's a lot of people who have a tough time figuring out how to even get into it, right? Mm-hmm. And so I'm curious, what would be your advice for someone who said, yeah, I would like to do what he's doing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Yeah. Well, I, I think the first thing to do is to think about what are my <span style="color:red" data-ts="2539.08" data-end_ts="2539.28" title="2539.08" id=c_"2539.08">__ma__</span> my natural inclinations with my instrument? You know what, that's what I did with the bass. Like, well, what kind of motions do I like with the bass? It's a very physical instrument. It's big. We move a lot when we play it. And then I, so I, I kind of acknowledge that what my, those natural motions and interactions between me and the physical instrument are. And then I say, okay, well, how can I, how can I tap into that, that interaction and make it do something different than it normally would that I would normally expect it to? Sure. So like I, for bassist, we tend to kind of sway, we can sway a bit while we play, you know, and glissandos are kind of fun motions, at least for me to play. Tapping on the, on the strings, doing, playing that way is another thing that I, that I do acoustically when I'm improvising. And so I, I use all those, those gestures and try and find a way, then find a way how you can assign that to electronic events. I know that sounds really general 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> Well, no, but I think that that makes a lot of sense because again, if I just visualize, a bassist playing, it's different, I'll, I'll make a comparison with, with my friend and someone who I, I interviewed recently, Jane Riggler, who's aist, right? Yeah. Although that can be a physical instrument as well, you know, because it's small. And so you have the freedom of movement, it's completely different movements, movement vectors than you're going to get from a bass. And so there's kind of some uniqueness based on the instrument and mapping it to sort of controller functions. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Yeah. I think, and like what you were saying about using, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data">PD</a> as glue, I think that's where having something like that is really useful. Because then you don't have to create a new, necessarily a new controller for each, for each instance or for each use of it. Right. Because then you can run it through pd, you can manipulate the numbers so that it fits the way that person holds their instrument, the way they play, the way they move. I wrote a, I wrote a piece about a year ago for the, for a new music concert here at Dixie State that was for trumpet and WiMo and, with just looping and some effects and, and panning, it was a four channel surround piece. So, the trumpet player, I had him put a, a silent brass mute in the trumpet so that you'd only hear the amplified sound in the hall. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Right, right. And then we mounted a, a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2701.06" data-end_ts="2701.28" title="2701.06" id=c_"2701.06">__wee__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2701.28" data-end_ts="2701.4" title="2701.28" id=c_"2701.28">__mode__</span> on the top of his trumpet was some rubber bands and just strapped it on there. And so I said first thing, once I had the, you know, the piece and the structure written for it, I had him get up on stage and start playing. And while he was playing, I, you know, okay, play in your neutral position. I told him to turn as far to the right, you feel comfortable as far to the left down and up. And as he was doing that, I was looking at the, the sliders in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data">PD</a> and adjusting the numbers so that it would fit his playing characteristics. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2732.78" data-end_ts="2733" title="2732.78" id=c_"2732.78">__Oh__</span>, that's, that's cool. And that makes a lot of sense too. Again, that sort of like tweaking to get the, get the sweet spot. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Yeah. Even at one point he didn't, he didn't, wasn't comfortable. I, I think with like the numbers that I, on the buttons that I had assigned things to on the controller. Right. So I, I said, yeah, no problem. I switched the buttons around <laugh> Sure. As to what they did so that it was more the way he wanted it. Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2757.3" data-end_ts="2757.52" title="2757.3" id=c_"2757.3">__And__</span> or like, my idea was if you went down, it should be the sound should be at the front of the hall and when he pointed the trumpet up, it should be in the back. Right. But in his mind, it, it, it would be backwards from that, that that was reversed. So, alright. No problem. Switch the, switch the patch lines on, on in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data">PD</a> and it's all fixed. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I'm curious then, given, given the kind of things you do in the performance <span style="color:red" data-ts="2781.76" data-end_ts="2781.88" title="2781.76" id=c_"2781.76">__r__</span> you've pulled together, but also given sort of the, the fact that you're dependent on an already obsolete piece of hardware, I'm curious because I'm curious about this. So whenever I run into people that do this, how much concern do you have about sort of staking your performance system on things that can just evaporate? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>And you're talking about the Axon <span style="color:red" data-ts="2809.48" data-end_ts="2809.68" title="2809.48" id=c_"2809.48">__premise__</span>? Yes, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I am. Right. Yeah. <laugh> indeed. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Yeah. I guess I, I try not to think about it <laugh>, because if that broke, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2819.14" data-end_ts="2819.36" title="2819.14" id=c_"2819.14">__you__</span> can still buy 'em at, you know, on, eBay or whatever. But it's, at least <span style="color:red" data-ts="2824.9" data-end_ts="2825.12" title="2824.9" id=c_"2824.9">__for__</span>, for me, it's kind of an expensive piece of year to have to, to buy if it breaks. And I don't have a backup port or anything, so I, I'm kind of, if it broke, I'd be kind of screwed. I don't really know what to, like, my next step that I'd like to do is to, and I've started working on it already the last few months actually, trying to make a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data">PD</a> patch or a, or a max patch that'll do what this does, at least kind of approximate it as close as I can. Sure. But I, I really liked the, what I, when I was making those and trying out different, different methods of it, I'd be playing and thinking, oh, okay, that's going all right, that's doing pretty well. And then I'd switch back over to the axon and it's like, oh no, that's way more instant <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>And, and I just, maybe it's 'cause I'm way more comfortable with it too by now, but, yeah, I'd love to find a, like a programmer or something who could make a, a plugin that, uses that same really quick, whether extrapolation or whether how they figure out, how here's the pitch before it even hears an entire waveform. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 'cause that's one of the issues with doing the pitch committee conversion is that a lot of 'em wait for an entire cycle to occur. And if you're talking about a 50 hertz tone, that takes a measurable amount of time to get a full cycle. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Yeah. Well, like the base, I, I've got an extension on it, so the lowest pitch is down around 34 hertz. Oh my God. So if you're, and most pitch to MIDI stuff, I, especially hardware, like, it'll, it'll wait for at least two cycles Right. Of it because it wants to, you know, two or three cycles. It wants to get an, an average of the three before it responds to it. That way it doesn't get all glitchy and respond to overtones and stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So in that case then, you're talking about a 15th of a second just to get two cycles, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Yeah. Yeah. So it, what's cool about the axon is how it, at least the way they describe it is that it figures out how fast the waveform is. You know, it's crossing the zero line. Right. And if it knows the angle it's crossing at and the speed it's crossing at, it can determine what the pitch is going to be. Yeah. Yeah. Before it actually even sounds, but yeah, it responds really well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>It'd be cool to, to be able to have a software version of that. Definitely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. You know, some of the things that you're talking about, are I think concerns for a lot of people because regardless of what you're using, whether it's a software package that could go obsolete or, you know, hardware that could cease working and the manufacturer's gone, there's a lot of concerns about, some of this kind of stuff. Now, the interesting thing about doing the work that you do is it actually seems to kind of surpass just being experimental and electronic. I mean, when I listen to your work, there's your, your classical influences are very clear, but so your jazz influences mm-hmm. <affirmative>, and you know, so you talked before about listening to like Charlie Hayden a lot, and, and I definitely, hear a lot of that in your, in your playing when you go to kind of the pisco and jazz <span style="color:red" data-ts="3029.28" data-end_ts="3029.6" title="3029.28" id=c_"3029.28">__style__</span> playing Thanks. And, but also working with the bow gives you an almost a synthetic or a synthesis style way of manipulating the envelope that most other instruments don't have. So you actually, because because you have this interface with the instrument, you kind of are able to surpass the, the slavish devotion to a hardware thing, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But what would be the thing that would really affect your ability to play if it stopped <span style="color:red" data-ts="3062.21" data-end_ts="3062.56" title="3062.21" id=c_"3062.21">__exist__</span> existing? Is it looping in software? Is it the ability to, to use pedals for like doing context switching? What is the thing that is most central to the electro-acoustic hybrid? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Man, you put it that way. You know, if I, I'm sitting here thinking which one's most important, if it all shut down, like in the sound and the electricity went off right, and the lights went off and everything, I'd, I think, oh, okay. I can still play <laugh>, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>I can still play acoustic and I can still improvise or something. And so that's all good as far as my electroacoustic interaction, you know, if, if the laptop, like anybody, if the computer itself just crashed, then, you know, all that would go down the tubes, the looping, the electroacoustic sounds and all that still be left with as if the <span style="color:red" data-ts="3115.6" data-end_ts="3115.8" title="3115.6" id=c_"3115.6">__sound__</span>, the power went off. I, I like using my, I really like using all of them mixed together. I think that's what makes it feel creative to me. Like what you're talking about, not focusing on the one piece of hardware, the one piece of software. So they're, but by doing that, they're all kind of equally important. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. One other thing, going back to your, to your album that I'm actually really curious about, there's some sections, and particularly in the first track, which is, it's like day one. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Oh yeah. Day one. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You have a section of it where there's a pitch variation that goes really high almost. It sounds very, like, very much like a viola or something, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Oh, with the loop, and then the loop goes really high. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Is that what it is? Are you doing a loop and then just pitch, shifting it really far, or, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Oh yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3171.8" data-end_ts="3172" title="3171.8" id=c_"3171.8">__What__</span>, what's going on is I started, I layered the loop on there, and then I just had a assigned one of the buttons on my foot pedal to, to be, it was like, I think it was something crazy like four octave shift or something like 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That. Yeah. It was, it was very disturbing, quite frankly. Yeah. <laugh> and you're expecting to hear base count and all of a sudden <laugh>. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Yeah. I apologize if I made your dogs go crazy. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, no, it was more like I was, I was, I was relaxing to the dult tones of bass while laying in bed, and all of of a sudden it was sort of like that Hitchcock moment. <laugh>. Oh 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Yeah. <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Bam. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>That, so the whooping stuff I do, I do, I put on a pitch shift and sp it speeds up and it gets high, but that high <span style="color:red" data-ts="3219.91" data-end_ts="3220.6" title="3219.91" id=c_"3219.91">__<inaudible>__</span> kind of sound on it, that's just <span style="color:red" data-ts="3222.62" data-end_ts="3222.84" title="3222.62" id=c_"3222.62">__the__</span> standard base sound. I'm just up beyond the fingerboard pulling the string to the side a bit and then glistening back. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see. Okay. All right. Really interesting. Well, it's just one of those things where I wasn't sure if it was electronic technique, it was performance technique, although I was sure it wasn't, but, or what kind of combination it was that, that got that particular sound out of it. Because one of the things I notice is that a lot of people that are doing acoustic electroacoustic work, avoid a lot of pitch changing, mostly because it's, you know, it'll either munchkin <span style="color:red" data-ts="3262.57" data-end_ts="3262.73" title="3262.57" id=c_"3262.57">__eyes__</span> on 'em or whatever. And so then when granular stuff came, there was kind of this burst of energy around doing granular pitch shifting, and then mm-hmm. <affirmative>, everyone was like, oh, we're tired of granular pitch shifting, and they stopped. Right. And, and so it was kind of, it was actually felt kind of unique and new again to hear these kind of extreme pitch shifts. But I was wondering what technique you actually used to do that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Yeah, so it was, it was just a combination of pitch, shifting the loop, and then playing really high on the <span style="color:red" data-ts="3291.21" data-end_ts="3291.41" title="3291.21" id=c_"3291.21">__bay__</span> <laugh>. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I see. All right. Interesting. But that, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>All the pieces on those, except for those Zion landscapes, ones at the end, those were all improvisations that I, we had just moved into our house and I built a, made a studio space in here. And I thought, well, what can I do that'll get me in the studio recording every day? Uhhuh <affirmative>. And so I, I told myself, I'm gonna get, for the next month, I'm gonna be in there every day and I'll record something new and I'll post it up on my website and onto Facebook. So I did that for a month, and at the end of the month, I had a few tracks that I, I really, that I liked and thought, okay, I can make an album out of this <laugh>. Sure. So all those were just, and the reason why I called it days End was 'cause most of those were at the end of the day after I'd already, I was done teaching classes at Dixie and I was going off, to play a show that night at, at tuon out for the, the Broadway shows out there. And I would just go into my studio for, for an hour or so, or half an hour, sometimes less <laugh> and just plug everything in and see what I could do with, with live and and my pedal board and my base. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that's awesome. And I think that the work is is phenomenal. I just really enjoyed it a lot and, congratulations on putting. Well, what's interesting is the way you talk about it here too, it kind of makes sense then why there's a coherent sound to it and a, and a coherent movement through the pieces. It seems very much a hole and it's really, really quite beautiful. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Oh, thanks very much. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, Robert, I want to thank you for your time. I had a couple other questions, but I'm just not gonna be able to get to 'em because we've burned through our hour. But I want to thank you so much for taking the time to talk to us, and to kind of fill in some holes about the electric acoustic space and particularly how it applies to base. I think that it's an area that, that deserves the kind of exploration you're giving and I think it's, it's again, a beautiful sound, such a human sound, and it's really interesting to mix that experimentally with electronics. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3420.16" data-end_ts="3420.4" title="3420.16" id=c_"3420.16">__It's__</span> wonderful stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Thank you very much darling. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. And, with that, one last thing then. Do you, what's next for you? What's, what's on the horizon 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Next? I, now that I've kind of got everything really settled with my plane and everything with my setup, I feel really comfortable with and I'm trying to, I'm sending out letters and trying to set up performances at universities and for festivals. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that sounds great. Hopefully, that'll open the door for a lot of people, a lot of other people to hear your work as well and see you perform. I, you're gonna have to keep in touch with me and make sure that you let me know if you're performing anywhere in my neck of the woods, because I would love to see you in action with that, with that rig. That'd be really cool. Yeah. Alright, well thanks so much for your time. I really appreciate it. Thanks. Have a great day. Bye. You 
</p>

<p>
<b>Robert: </b>Too. Bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And so there lies podcast number 62. I <span style="color:red" data-ts="3484.4" data-end_ts="3484.56" title="3484.4" id=c_"3484.4">__want__</span> to thank again, Robert for spending the time with us. It's gonna be worth your while to go over and check out Robert Mathesonnet. That's probably the easiest place to find out more about his work. From there you can go to the recordings section of his site, which will take you to his band application where you can listen to some of his music. It's pretty incredible. I, I certainly enjoyed it. I want to, again, take the opportunity to thank everyone <span style="color:red" data-ts="3514.74" data-end_ts="3514.96" title="3514.74" id=c_"3514.74">__and__</span> who helps out with the podcast. I especially want to thank folks at Zootopia who gave me a nice little award, for 2014. I was actually surprised and quite pleased about that. Other than that, I want to thank everyone for listening again, and if you have any questions or if you yourself would like to be, would like to be interviewed, feel free to drop me <span style="color:red" data-ts="3540.08" data-end_ts="3540.16" title="3540.08" id=c_"3540.08">__a__</span> line. Otherwise, I'll talk to you next week. Thanks.
