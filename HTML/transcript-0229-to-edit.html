<b>Darwin: </b>Today's interview is with Dmitri SFC Probably one of the areas he's pretty well known is his work with Slope one 14. Slope one 14 right now is having a Kickstarter, about doing a release, a digital release digital ep. If, you are into host music, particularly classic host music with incredible vocals, you're gonna want to check it out. I will have, the link in the show notes. Otherwise, if you just look up Slope one 14 and Kickstarter, you're gonna run across it. It's a Kickstarter for the Keep Flying Digital ep. It's gonna be wrapping up pretty soon, so please get out there and support them. I think this is a great experiment, and I'd like to help out if we can. So, with that, here's a discussion with Dmitri SFC 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today, I have the great pleasure of getting to talk to somebody who I've been following on Facebook for a while. It goes by the artist's named Dmitri SFC pretty phenomenal individual. Once you hear all the different things, you'll kind of follow along with me. In fact, though, if you're kind of a synth head and you kind of share many of the same friends as I have, you probably have run into seeing videos of his work with, slope 1 1 4, which is a duet of sort of like massive piles of synthesis and beautiful voice accompaniment. It's pretty amazing stuff. They've got a Kickstarter coming around that we'll talk to talk about in a little bit. But also, Dmitri is involved in synth building at sort of an extreme level. So we're gonna talk a little bit about that. Heyman, how's it going? Hi, Darwin. Thanks a lot for taking the time to, to join us on the podcast. I really appreciate it, man. Thank 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri SFC: </b>You for having me. This is, I feel really lucky to get a chance to get on your podcast, especially last minute while I'm doing this Kickstarter and everything. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, let's talk about the Kickstarter Right away. I, I happen to run across it on Facebook, and that's what caused me to reach out to you because I've always kind of been a fan of the Slope, 1 1 4 stuff. And so I saw you guys were having a Kickstarter. I reached out and I was really pleased that we could talk about it. Tell us a little bit about the Kickstarter. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>This is our fourth Kickstarter. It's our first time doing a digital release on Kickstarter. The first three times we did vinyl, we were obviously successful the first three times, but we don't know if this is gonna be a success because this is an experiment. But most people that do that make house music. They just release their music via Bport and iTunes. We want to go direct to the artist with the Kickstarter. <span style="color:red" data-ts="167.745" data-end_ts="167.965" title="167.745" id=c_"167.745">__The__</span> Kickstarter offers a lot of, benefits. Like it has like a sense of urgency. It kind of enables us to generate a lump sum at the beginning of a release. If we, we were to just, you know, throw our music upon the streaming service, we would get no lump sum. We would just have to like, make a million more songs before we would get any money for it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, it's kind of interesting because one of the things that, your online opinions that you carry is one of being, a little, I don't know, concerned about the state of the industry, especially the state of, of recording business and recording labels and stuff like that. You kind of, you kind of hold a pretty severe line with some of that stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>Yeah. You know, I, I was, releasing records before it turned into a download market, and back then, guys like me, we would get like, you know, maybe a thousand dollars per record to produce a record from like a record label. And when, the vinyl industry went away, all that money went away. It just, like, a lot of, a lot of my peers just accepted the <span style="color:red" data-ts="232.565" data-end_ts="232.885" title="232.565" id=c_"232.565">__change__</span>. And when I met Elise, she was such a good singer that I, I kind of didn't wanna accept the change. I was like, no, I'm gonna figure out how to generate money for this girl. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>You know, via her singing, you know what I mean? Because, because she, like everybody else, you know, we all just work at, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="247.725" data-end_ts="247.885" title="247.725" id=c_"247.725">__great__</span>, well, she works at nine to five, you know, right. In the medical industry. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But you've done a really good job of not only, you know, getting some cash out of, out of the audience, but also focusing attention. I think one of the things that happens is if you kind of align yourself just with streaming, one of the things that can happen is that you can, you can put some effort into, into getting some engagement with it, but since there isn't this sense of urgency around a release or anything like that, you know, it just sort of like, kind of peters out. It goes online and, and, and as a download, and you hope someone pays attention someday. It seems like it doesn't have nearly the kind of it excitement that like releases did back when you were hunting vinyl. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>Totally. And the, the campaign for, crowdfunding is a, is a marketing campaign for the music in itself. Right. So instead of paying somebody else to go around and, and be my cheerleader, I just go on Facebook and cheerlead for the track until we raised, you know, the amount. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Now, this time, this time around, as you said, this is a Kickstarter for digital release rather than a vinyl one. And so the individual, contribution requests are relatively small. Right. I, I got in there and I did a, there was actually, I, I really want to check out what you do with <span style="color:red" data-ts="327.885" data-end_ts="328.045" title="327.885" id=c_"327.885">__the__</span> dub version of it. So, I signed on for that. Right. But it's not, it doesn't end up being a great big pile of money. What you have to do is you have to kind of have a lot of people willing to come and do it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>Yeah. And this one's an experiment. The other, our past three Kickstarters only took about 70 people, each one Okay. To raise, the, the goal and each goal was different. Our last goal was three grand. Yeah. After 70 people, once again, it, it passed. So we noticed that the average person contributes about $30 when we do a record with a T-shirt. Right. And so this is, this is a totally different experiment. We, <span style="color:red" data-ts="364.505" data-end_ts="364.725" title="364.505" id=c_"364.505">__we__</span>, when we were doing that, we kind of lost the attention of all the DJs who only play digital files. And so in this effort, we're, we're trying to reach out to those people, the people that we kind of lost attention of. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I hope that, I hope that it's successful, for the people that are listening. I will both on Facebook and on the, landing page for the podcast, I'll make sure that I have links, to the Kickstarter campaign. If nothing else. I thought it was really innovative because it's, it's a small amount. You know, a lot of times people are, have a tendency not to do small amounts on Kickstarter. They tend to look to <span style="color:red" data-ts="401.025" data-end_ts="401.245" title="401.025" id=c_"401.025">__Pa__</span>, Patreon or some of those things. I thought it's a really interesting way to see if you can use the Kickstarter model for sort of like a low dollar, item thing. And I, I hope that it works out well, because I think that's a really smart way to go about it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>Our goal is to raise a thousand dollars, or is to earn a thousand dollars from releasing the song. If we can do that, then we plan to do it like every 30 days or something. Sure. Or, you know. Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="427.465" data-end_ts="427.685" title="427.465" id=c_"427.465">__The__</span>, the whole idea is to like gain momentum naturally by releasing content regularly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, you kind of do that already with the, with the videos video work. You have produced kind of like a regular video release, although not on a monthly basis, but it's, or at least in, at least the way that I run across it, it seems to be a fairly regular thing. So you, you've stayed on my mind consistently, like over the last maybe year, year and a half. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>Thank you. I, I think that I, I, sorry to cut you off, but I think that if we can release content more regularly, then maybe the streaming will pick up like the, like releasing some music on Spotify won't seem like a, like a waste. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. Yeah. Because it's not, you're not squirting it out there for four people. You've already built the momentum. That makes a lot of sense. One of the things that I, I at least get from watching your videos is that it would kind of be a little hard to take this act on the road because one of the tenets of your video is that there are god's own pile of synths that you use, you know, that are in the studio. When you're doing these performances, do you have any mechanism to do, to do live performance? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>Yeah. We, I had a custom, box built that I can take on any airplane, just about, there might be like one or two airline maybe in France that won't allow this the size. But I went online and I looked at all the size of all the overheads allowed in all the airlines. And then I had my friend, shout out to Dave <span style="color:red" data-ts="518.835" data-end_ts="519.125" title="518.835" id=c_"518.835">__Dick__</span>, built me this case. And then, I got, right now I have Octa <span style="color:red" data-ts="524.045" data-end_ts="524.245" title="524.045" id=c_"524.045">__track__</span> in there, and I can just use sequencer and I can throw in various little synths to play from it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, so you use kind of the Octa <span style="color:red" data-ts="531.925" data-end_ts="532.125" title="531.925" id=c_"531.925">__track__</span> though, as the center for that performance system? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>Yeah, for the live rig, but I never busted out when I'm at home, you know. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. That's, that's kind of interesting because to me, well, I, for me, the Octa <span style="color:red" data-ts="543.085" data-end_ts="543.285" title="543.085" id=c_"543.085">__Track__</span> is one of those things that has always been a little bit of a puzzle. So <laugh>, it would be hard for me to only use it for gigs because I would completely need to be retrained every time I would pull it out a thing. It's pretty, it's got kind of a complex thing. And I think, I think some of it is I'm an old MPC guy, and I think that MPC head doesn't really work in the same brain as Octa <span style="color:red" data-ts="566.485" data-end_ts="566.685" title="566.485" id=c_"566.485">__Track__</span> Head. I think they're two like really different things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>You nailed it. That's pretty much why I want to trade my Octa <span style="color:red" data-ts="572.165" data-end_ts="572.325" title="572.165" id=c_"572.165">__track__</span> back for a 1000 again. Oh, really? For an MPC 1000. No kidding. Yeah, same reason, <span style="color:red" data-ts="577.235" data-end_ts="577.725" title="577.235" id=c_"577.235">__because__</span> I just forget a little thing here and there, you know? <span style="color:red" data-ts="579.725" data-end_ts="579.845" title="579.725" id=c_"579.725">__Yeah__</span>. So, yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I always thought the MPC was perfectly simple and that it, it had all the shit I needed to do. Not really anything extra. It was the right stuff. But 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>For playing live the <span style="color:red" data-ts="591.325" data-end_ts="591.765" title="591.325" id=c_"591.325">__NPC__</span> 1000 with <span style="color:red" data-ts="592.525" data-end_ts="592.645" title="592.525" id=c_"592.525">__the__</span> JJOS, and you can trigger sequences from each pad. Yeah. Right. That's the joint. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It is. That's, that's some amazing stuff. Indeed. One of the things I like doing in my, in my podcast is I like talking to people about the back, their background, how they get to be the artist and creator that they are. Now, we haven't even started talking yet about your, your synth building background, but I think that that's kind of a critical part of your background as well. Could you take us a little bit through how you came up, to be interested both in hardware and in music, music creation, and particularly your kind of love of, of house music and where that came from? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>When I was about 10 years old, my uncle, he used to take me to the flea markets to collect oldies records. He was a, he was into oldies. We were used to collect funk and like old r and b, you know, Motown and stuff like that. Sure. And so that's what kind of got made me want to become a dj, you know. And when I was a teenager in, in California, the raves were, <span style="color:red" data-ts="654.225" data-end_ts="654.445" title="654.225" id=c_"654.225">__he__</span> were the biggest thing. It was, it was the, it was the early nineties. So I just wanted to do what all the cool kids were doing and go to the party and go to the rave. And, I didn't even, I wasn't even into house music until I went to some rave in Richmond and took some acid and, experienced the, the Bay Area Deep house music scene as it really was in, its in its thriving, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>And it was, it was magical. It was the, it wasn't the big room at the rave with the big commercial music. It was the small room in the front and, and everyone was in the front and everyone was dancing in such an intense way, you know, it was, everyone was high off their tits. And it, it was pretty amazing. I never seen dancing like that in my life, you know? Right. And, I mean, and I, I had been, I was from the hip hop world, you know, and, and, and we <span style="color:red" data-ts="699.765" data-end_ts="699.885" title="699.765" id=c_"699.765">__had__</span>, you know, we were been break dancing since we were growing up and everything, but it was nothing like people break dancing to that house music when they're, when the whole room was high on ecstasy. It was a magical, tribal, natural moment, you know? And, that's what converted me. And, and from that moving on, I pretty much, you know, wanted to, I already was a dj. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>I already DJ'ed hip hop in my, in my garage at home and collected the <span style="color:red" data-ts="720.845" data-end_ts="720.965" title="720.845" id=c_"720.845">__record__</span> since I was a little kid. But then that made me go into house music full on. And, I met a kid in my high school. There was a child prodigy guitar player. His older brother was a producer, and he, his older brother, let us go in his room and make a beat. And we're like 15 years old. And that day he gave me a drum machine. He just very generously gave me a TR 5 0 5. And, and that was my first drum machine. And, I was, I was kind of a little ghetto kid. I didn't like, my family didn't have money. Like my turntable set up was something I got at the flea market, like one Sony and one Panasonic, and whatever mixer get, you know. Right. And, so that was kind of what started my love for gear. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>Like, I was a little kid. I used to go to the flea market and buy, like whatever home stereo equipment I think would, would add up to make my quote unquote studio at the time, you know? Right. Like, like 13, 13, 14-year-old little kid, you know, flash forward, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="769.605" data-end_ts="769.845" title="769.605" id=c_"769.605">__till__</span> I, I get to be about 18, and I come to the city and I'm, I'm DJing. I'm already DJing <span style="color:red" data-ts="774.765" data-end_ts="774.885" title="774.765" id=c_"774.765">__at__</span> Little Raves here and there. And I come to the city and I meet all these cats that are older than me, DJs and guys who are actually making records already. And, guys who are kind of famous for DJing. And pre, before I knew it, I was DJing at all the clubs in town. I became a popular DJ when I was only, 19. And I did, I had a fake, ID shout out to the guy who lives in Aptos, California, David Jeffrey Emmett, because that's the guy that his, his ID got me into all the clubs when I, when 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Id he wired you up, <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>A girl, that I knew, found that, found the idea on the floor party and goes, this looks like Dmitri. And that's how I got into <span style="color:red" data-ts="813.985" data-end_ts="814.205" title="813.985" id=c_"813.985">__any__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="814.205" data-end_ts="814.445" title="814.205" id=c_"814.205">__clubs__</span>. That's awesome. So, yeah. So I started producing, you know, the, then I called her mentor them, Stephanie Smiley. She told me, she told me, you know, if you want to get gigs in Europe and other places, you gotta make records. So I started making records and there was like, gear around. It was like Rollings, heavy Rollings and cogs, you know, that was like around the neighborhood that I could play with and, and get my hands on. There was people who were always having me over because I was a popular DJ and showing me how to use the gear. And I kind of became like a, I kind of became like a mascot in Lower Hate, because I was younger than a lot of the producers. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>And I had that young energy, and they, they could bring, they could invite me to their studio, and I would come over and bring some energy to their studio, and they would show me, teach me things. And so I, I was very passionate because like I said, I was a, before that, I was a little ghetto kid that just always dreamed about having gear, but could never afford it. So then once I got in front of the gear, I was very passionate. People would start actually giving me gear because they would see that I would learn it inside out. Right. Like, so happy. They, they, you know, a lot of people had stuff just sitting around that they would never touch. And they would go, I'm gonna go bring it to Dmitri and watch him make some songs with it. And so that's kind of what happened back then, though, I never touched the modular. 'cause I remember seeing a modular like one time, and one of my older friends was like, oh, you don't wanna deal with that. You'll never get anything done <laugh>, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>He was right, obviously. Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Exactly. Yeah. I'm, I'm laughing because it hurts <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>You know, and, and I would meet kids that were kind of gearheads that had a different type of mentality. Like, I would meet experimentalists, so it'd be like, oh, I have all that gear too. I make dance music too. And then they would come over and play it for me and be like, bleeps and bloops. Right. And I would be really confused because like, I was over there taking acid, making beats too. And I was like, but maybe their acid's better, or it's too strong or something. I don't understand. Like, it <span style="color:red" data-ts="925.005" data-end_ts="925.165" title="925.005" id=c_"925.005">__just__</span>, like, where's the beat? Where's <span style="color:red" data-ts="927.405" data-end_ts="927.525" title="927.405" id=c_"927.405">__the__</span>, you know, it's not house music. You know what I mean? Yeah, yeah. But later on, you know, when I got into building the sense, I started to understand, wait a minute, there's already a whole bunch of people who are experimentalists. They do have all the gear too, and actually know how to use it too. And it's, and so later on I started to make friends with experimentalists. Once I started to build surges. And, and, and I learned a lot from experimentalists. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Who are some of these people that, that you were working with? <span style="color:red" data-ts="951.145" data-end_ts="951.365" title="951.145" id=c_"951.145">__The__</span>, the people that you consider experimentalists? Who are some of those folks? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>One guy named Esent, Matthew, he used to come over to my house and play my surge all the time. I started to meet, actually, once I started to build a surge, I started to meet all these people who <span style="color:red" data-ts="965.885" data-end_ts="966.005" title="965.885" id=c_"965.885">__were__</span> into the Surge way before me. Right. Like all these futurists, like Bay Area futurists and like people who are like in the tech world that are like this one guy, Alex Rudi. Yeah. He was making music for Atari way back in the day. Yeah. And him and his buddy, Richard, they had a band in the eighties and they had a surge, and they like invited me over and, and, you know, to play it and to check it out and to, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, Alex was a really good friend of mine. And, it's funny, I that the reason I asked is because, you know, back in the day I kind of knew a bunch of the Bay Area people that were surge heads, and it was like, but it was that kind of thing where they'd get into it, next thing you know, you'd, you'd ask them to play <span style="color:red" data-ts="1008.205" data-end_ts="1008.405" title="1008.205" id=c_"1008.205">__center__</span> music. And it sounded like, you know, maybe a, a combination of trash cans falling down a stairs plus a ship running into the Golden Gate Bridge. Right. <laugh>, that's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1019.815" data-end_ts="1020.165" title="1019.815" id=c_"1019.815">__about__</span> Exactly. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1020.645" data-end_ts="1020.805" title="1020.645" id=c_"1020.645">__You__</span> know, because it was like, they would go so far down the rabbit hole with that stuff that you, you'd wondered if they'd ever come out. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>Exactly right. <laugh>, that's the feeling I had when I was younger. And I'd meet people and play me that music. I was afraid, I was like, oh, no, this is gonna happen to me. <laugh> <laugh>. But, and, and it did <laugh>, but it, but it's cool though. It's, it's fun. It's, it's different, you know, playing The Surge has totally changed, has given me a whole new musical life. Before The Surge, I was just, I was chopping up disco loops, you know, on the computer. Like <span style="color:red" data-ts="1053.685" data-end_ts="1053.885" title="1053.685" id=c_"1053.685">__all__</span>, like all the other house music producers, something. I don't know what it was. You know, what it was, is I got a job in technology at a, a startup at this place called Kite tv. Before I knew it, I was, I was working on the computer, you know, all day for work. And then when I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1068.205" data-end_ts="1068.365" title="1068.205" id=c_"1068.205">__come__</span>, I'd be like, okay, now I wanna come home and make some beats. And then I realize I didn't wanna be looking at a computer screen anymore. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. I think that that kinda attitude is actually what, what has launched this kind of new world of hardware, thank God. Right. Because, you know, for a while there're kind of starting with, when Sonic Foundry came out with the acid, and then all the different software packages and vsts and all this stuff, it looked like it was going to be, you know, our, our entire life was gonna be surrounded by the glow of the LCD screen. And in a way, thank God for, for the fact that people did kind of reject, reject looking at the computer, went back to looking at hardware and started diving into that to kind of allow people to say, well, we could, we could make some of that shit too. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>Man, it's been pretty cool. I'm really, I'm really stoked about it. You know, like, okay. So when I got into building the Surge, there was kind of a little opening. There was a little window of a few years where it was like, you can make some money, hand building some stuff, but the people were already getting into the SMD and Americans were starting to have SMD stuff produced, like massively. And now it's like Barringer is, you know, knocking off everything. People are complaining about it, but I, I think it's pretty cute. I mean, you can go out and buy a cent for under 500 bucks. Analog polys <span style="color:red" data-ts="1151.375" data-end_ts="1151.455" title="1151.375" id=c_"1151.375">__sense__</span>, right? I mean, I'm, I can't, I can't be mad at that. <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Indeed. Now, let's talk about, about you and the search. How did you get into search initially? And then you have kind of become well known as Surge Builder and kind of repair guy. You seem to like have your, a big part of your life now is kind of like attached to Surge. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>It's a trip. I, was teaching circuit bending classes at Robot Speak. Actually, my studio had been burglarized. I lost all my gear in 2006. I produced rap in, in Fillmore rap music. I produced like over a hundred rap songs in 2006. My studio was burglarized. I lost everything. Oh. And then I was working, I was working at Kite tv and I was like, man, when my little salary, I was like, I can't, you know, buy all the gear I want <span style="color:red" data-ts="1199.935" data-end_ts="1200.135" title="1199.935" id=c_"1199.935">__again__</span>, but let me like see if I can learn how to like, build something that would be cheaper or something. You know, I didn't really have any building skills, but I started looking at circuit bending. I started, I seen, I saw like little drum machines with extra knobs and switches on 'em. And I was like, where is that? So I started collecting stuff like that and learning how torick <span style="color:red" data-ts="1217.575" data-end_ts="1217.735" title="1217.575" id=c_"1217.575">__it__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1217.735" data-end_ts="1217.895" title="1217.735" id=c_"1217.735">__in__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>And then a couple years after that, I realized that I wanted to build a synthesizer. I, I realized that I had, I can read schematics. I understand what the parts are now and how they work. So I, I started researching what synthesizer can I build? And then I didn't even know that they built that there, there was any synthesizer <span style="color:red" data-ts="1233.135" data-end_ts="1233.335" title="1233.135" id=c_"1233.135">__and__</span> had <span style="color:red" data-ts="1233.495" data-end_ts="1233.775" title="1233.495" id=c_"1233.495">__never__</span> come from San Francisco. I think I had seen like the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1236.495" data-end_ts="1236.695" title="1236.495" id=c_"1236.495">__mug__</span>. They <span style="color:red" data-ts="1237.015" data-end_ts="1237.175" title="1237.015" id=c_"1237.015">__seemed__</span> like the mug documentary, you know, and it, and that kind of, the, the way that every documentary makes every artist out to be is like, they're the ultimate creator and nothing existed before them, almost <span style="color:red" data-ts="1246.485" data-end_ts="1246.775" title="1246.485" id=c_"1246.485">__kind__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1246.775" data-end_ts="1246.855" title="1246.775" id=c_"1246.775">__of__</span>. Right. And, you know, so anyways, I'm researching online and then I learned about the Surge and I learned that it used to be built in San Francisco. And I was like, well, shit, if I'm gonna build a synthesizer, I'm gonna build that one. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>So I started, I started researching and trying to find, and I, I figured out that I had already been looking at Ken Stone's website right? At p at PC boards, but I didn't realize that half of them were <span style="color:red" data-ts="1270.525" data-end_ts="1270.805" title="1270.525" id=c_"1270.525">__Surge__</span> PC boards. So I, I, I hit up Ken and I was like, Hey Ken, I wanna do a, a surge building workshop at Robot Speak. What do you think? And he goes, oh, I think that's a great idea. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1282.485" data-end_ts="1282.685" title="1282.485" id=c_"1282.485">__Serge__</span> actually sent me a photo of Robot speak from through his front window <laugh>. And I was like, what? And then I, me and my girlfriend actually, 'cause we lived like five blocks from Robot Speak or something. We ran to Robot Speak and we were like, Hey, check this out. What the hell <laugh>? And then, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1299.375" data-end_ts="1299.725" title="1299.375" id=c_"1299.375">__speak__</span> Steve <span style="color:red" data-ts="1300.125" data-end_ts="1300.285" title="1300.125" id=c_"1300.125">__at__</span> Robot Speak. He was like, oh yeah, that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1301.965" data-end_ts="1302.125" title="1301.965" id=c_"1301.965">__guy__</span>, that guy Serge, he's come in here before he actually came in here recently just to say hi. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>He was tripping about this. He thought it was really cool that we have a store right here. Right? And I was like, what? And so, I started talking to LX and some of the older guys, the ser people that I had met around, they were like, yeah, man, I, they really thought that that, that we should do it. They were like, they kind of had let me know that when surge ended, when the company ended, it didn't end like great. Right. It wasn't wonderful. And so I, I didn't know the whole story, but I was like, okay, I'm gonna do this. I'm gonna let this surge guy know that there's some people in his neighborhood that think <span style="color:red" data-ts="1335.405" data-end_ts="1335.565" title="1335.405" id=c_"1335.405">__the__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1335.565" data-end_ts="1335.765" title="1335.565" id=c_"1335.565">__sense__</span> is cool and that we're doing it, we're bringing it back. So like, I came up with a whole marketing scheme to do a workshop, and I called it the Church of the Super Surge. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>Okay. And I took, I took a black and white photo of, I took a photo of my hand holding up a, a soldering iron. Like, it was like revolutionary style, and I black and white made a little flyer of it, right? And, it turned and it turned out that, Eric Drew Feldman, who's a great musician, he played with Captain Beef Hart and all kinds of, he's a keyboardist. He actually, was living in the house s <span style="color:red" data-ts="1369.065" data-end_ts="1369.285" title="1369.065" id=c_"1369.065">__on__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1369.305" data-end_ts="1369.525" title="1369.305" id=c_"1369.305">__the__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1369.615" data-end_ts="1369.965" title="1369.615" id=c_"1369.615">__robot__</span> speak. And he got the flyer and sent it to Serge and told Serge about it, called Serge, and was like, Hey, these guys are doing your thing down here. And so Serge Con, he contacted me, he, he got my email and emailed me. He gave us his blessing. And some, some pretty magical things happened. Like I put a SRA on the programmer sequencer. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>I etched it into the, I was etching with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1392.535" data-end_ts="1392.885" title="1392.535" id=c_"1392.535">__Frank__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1392.885" data-end_ts="1393.165" title="1392.885" id=c_"1392.885">__Clar__</span> in my backyard. And I, and I posted online. And, at this time, er secretly became my friend on Facebook while all the other like Muff wiggles and people, no one believed me, and no one knew that he was using at the time. He, he's now come out and he's now searched Shein on Facebook, but at the time, he was our <span style="color:red" data-ts="1412.805" data-end_ts="1413.005" title="1412.805" id=c_"1412.805">__iPad__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1413.355" data-end_ts="1413.645" title="1413.355" id=c_"1413.355">__Erez__</span> on Facebook. Mm-Hmm. And you, you would only know that if you knew that our pad Paneras was his pending that he used in, Doug Leonard's magazine in the seventies. So, yeah, he, he used to come out as <span style="color:red" data-ts="1428.585" data-end_ts="1428.805" title="1428.585" id=c_"1428.585">__RPA__</span> Paneras and give these articles on DIY and put the schematic in there for you to build your own program or touch capacities, keyboard and stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Unreal. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>So I got Surge sharpening giving me the, he, you know, he gave me the okay to give the Church of the Super <span style="color:red" data-ts="1444.055" data-end_ts="1444.405" title="1444.055" id=c_"1444.055">__surge__</span>. And, and, he's checking me and my girlfriend out on Facebook every day and giving me tips, like writing me emails, telling me tips on, you know, how to build this stuff, giving me some of his secrets. And, it was pretty cool. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1456.315" data-end_ts="1456.605" title="1456.315" id=c_"1456.315">__Mean__</span>, meanwhile, the people on Muffle are like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1458.265" data-end_ts="1458.485" title="1458.265" id=c_"1458.265">__oh__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1458.595" data-end_ts="1458.885" title="1458.595" id=c_"1458.595">__were__</span> getting mad because I was, disrupting the market. But they <span style="color:red" data-ts="1463.325" data-end_ts="1463.485" title="1463.325" id=c_"1463.325">__had__</span>, they had no idea that I was secretly friends with the guy who owned who, who created the design <laugh>. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Which, which market were they upset about? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>Okay. For one thing, I didn't plan on having any longevity and, and building the surge. Right. I did this as a, I did this as a favor to that man because I like him. Yeah, yeah. And so I, I purposefully disrupted the market <laugh>. And, and, I purposefully went in there as a renegade and said, I don't care what you guys are gonna talk say about me, I'm gonna, I'm gonna blow the shit up. And I did that <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, I mean, now that, the, the kind of way that search has always been, stayed connected to <span style="color:red" data-ts="1502.605" data-end_ts="1502.725" title="1502.605" id=c_"1502.605">__the__</span> system was for a long time these DIY things through Ken Stone, but now there's, RNS is, working with him on, some commercial versions of the stuff. Are are you still, are you still building or are you kind of like letting that occur? How, how are you remaining engaged with the search stuff? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>I'm still building a little bit here and there, but I'm not trying to compete with the market. I can't compete with, with RNS and, and yeah, I'm just kind of letting that occur. Like I did have chances way before that to capitalize and to have surge mass produced. Right. But every deal, every time that I, tried to step up, I kind of ran into little industry roadblocks and things that I just didn't have good feelings about it. And so now I find myself, working on music more this year, and that's not a bad thing. I could, you know, I could be managing some kind of mail order business and then like, you know, fixing messed up modules and stuff like that. But yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That sounds like a different, different version of a nine to <span style="color:red" data-ts="1566.925" data-end_ts="1567.085" title="1566.925" id=c_"1566.925">__find__</span> job in a way. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>Yeah. One or the other. You know, you're gonna work either way. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So let's talk about making music a little bit. First of all, let's tell us a little bit more about Slope 1 1 4. I, I am fascinated by these things because first of all, the woman is her name, Elise. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. She has got an incredible voice and, and a voice that seems to be like, made for, working with synths. You know, it's like, it like cuts through perfectly beautiful voice work, <laugh>, but, but also, the production of the things I, I hear that you, you've got this love of of house and deep house music, but it, it's not straight. Right? It seems to be really, it seems to be unique to that group, unique to Soul 1 1 4. What are the, what are the things that you feel like you're bringing into it to make it sort of unique and how does Elise influence you to make it special as a duet rather than just two people working simultaneously? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>Well, we both come from a house music, background. We both made house music for a long time before we found the surge. And before I found the surge, I was trying to make house music with Circuit <span style="color:red" data-ts="1644.225" data-end_ts="1644.445" title="1644.225" id=c_"1644.225">__Ben__</span> things and getting off on that experiment, you know, 'cause you, you go online and you look at the YouTubes of Circuit <span style="color:red" data-ts="1650.425" data-end_ts="1650.645" title="1650.425" id=c_"1650.425">__Ben__</span> things and they sound like Pure noise. And, it was, so to me, I saw it as a challenge. And then once we found the surge that that was the next challenge, it was, can I really make house music legitimately with this thing? Right. Like, without cheating, without cheating too much, you know what I mean? Like <laugh> like, yeah, I can, I can get <span style="color:red" data-ts="1669.325" data-end_ts="1669.485" title="1669.325" id=c_"1669.325">__admitted__</span> to CV and, and, and I've done that and that's fun. But, can I really like learn to, to tune all the oscillators and to make something that actually musically makes sense with the notes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>So, yeah, you can't, it turns out that yes, you can, that all those people who are making videos of surges on YouTube are actually just experimenting on purpose. And, and, and that's, that's why the surge is cool. And so, we, you know, we use limitations Slope <span style="color:red" data-ts="1694.745" data-end_ts="1694.965" title="1694.745" id=c_"1694.745">__one__</span> for the project <span style="color:red" data-ts="1695.785" data-end_ts="1696.005" title="1695.785" id=c_"1695.785">__is__</span> it always uses the surge. And how, how can I say this? For the last year, I basically just made my cords with a bee step pro. I would like take four oscillators and tune them into, like a, a major C cord. And then I would put a banana cable across all of them so that one voltage would, would, transpose all of them at once. Right. And I would just use once, once <span style="color:red" data-ts="1719.045" data-end_ts="1719.205" title="1719.045" id=c_"1719.045">__they__</span> on the beat step probe to do that. And so that limitation kind of made our sound for the last like year or two <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>Oh, that's really interesting. This year I'm studying jazz chords more, and so I'm using like, I'm using a keyboard this year just because I'm, 'cause of, I'm getting more into intervals, but yeah. And Elise, you know, she is a real musician, so she's real serious about her, her, musicianship. And I've done things like, you know, download some MIDI files and then play them on my <span style="color:red" data-ts="1746.925" data-end_ts="1747.125" title="1746.925" id=c_"1746.925">__surge__</span> and she'll come home and be like, I'll be like, babe, will you sing on this? And she'll be like, did you play that <laugh>? She, and then she, you know, she won't sing on it, you know, she takes you right away. She <span style="color:red" data-ts="1757.045" data-end_ts="1757.245" title="1757.045" id=c_"1757.045">__takes__</span> me on. Yeah. She, she keeps me honest as an artist for real. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's pretty cool. Well, it's interesting though that, you know, I was going to ask, because a lot of times, you know, in the image when, when I see a video, you guys work and there's obviously a ton of modular gear, but there's stuff that sounds kind of like legit 9 0 9 stuff or, or kind of rolling dish. The thing you said about doing the cord, I mean, that sounds an awful lot like when you do the held cord transposition on an old cord keyboard or whatever, but you're, are you, are you boiling all of this stuff out of the surge system? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>You mentioned 9 0 9 stuff. I probably couldn't do any of it without my hex in vers. Oh, I see. Okay. I mean, I gotta have my hex inverter 9 0 9 kick drum. Ah, that's, yeah, that one always makes it sound like house music 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. It does, you're right. There's something, you put that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1810.645" data-end_ts="1810.845" title="1810.645" id=c_"1810.645">__kick__</span>, you could, you could put a 9 0 9 over or underneath a ambulance siren and you kind of have a track. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>Yeah. Yeah, definitely. Definitely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's pretty amazing though that, that the surge is always part of the play for you. What other stuff though is <span style="color:red" data-ts="1826.995" data-end_ts="1827.285" title="1826.995" id=c_"1826.995">__comm__</span> use? So we've got the hex inverter, percussion stuff. What other things are sort of like your, your go-to tools? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>That's a good question. Well, I have my whole studio in there. The thing that ties it all together is the Allen and Heath mixed desk. It's an old one from the nineties. What is it, A C Qs three or something? C it's like a something S3 mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So I have the analog <span style="color:red" data-ts="1851.965" data-end_ts="1852.205" title="1851.965" id=c_"1851.965">__mixed__</span> desk, and then I have a, MO two interface with digital performer. Oh, okay. I have, outputs like crazy going to my mix desk. And so, everything runs through that. And then I have, outboard gear. So I'm actually have, I actually need my analog compressors. I wouldn't be able to make music without 'em. I've tried using digital compressors and they just don't work the same. Right. So I have a Yuri La Fours and apex, 9,000 series Modular modular rack. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And do you use <span style="color:red" data-ts="1887.845" data-end_ts="1888.005" title="1887.845" id=c_"1887.845">__that__</span> on the modular or do you use it on a voice or literally on everything? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>Oh, yeah. The baseline, the kick, the voice, any sound that, you know has, too big, too big of peaks, like maybe chords when you change the filter. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I always feel like, I'm surprised that more people that are more people that are into modular stuff don't also at the same time embrace, you know, different, compressor systems because I mean, the modular can make all the noise and it can, you know, be all the volumes too. Right. Different compressors react differently to different kinds of synth sounds. And I'm surprised you, you very seldom see people talking with any significant engagement about, you know, the interaction of their synth and a compressor in any useful way. I mean, I, one of the things I like doing is I like trying different Mic Pres as a front end to the, to the modular, because I think that that ends up really making it speak differently as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>Oh, hell yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So like with your <span style="color:red" data-ts="1955.245" data-end_ts="1955.445" title="1955.245" id=c_"1955.245">__com__</span> with your compressors, which ones are you using for this? You know, 'cause like the LA four I'm really familiar with and I, I can see where that could be useful. You know, I tend to think of that more as like a base or, you know, sometimes for a vocal thing. But what, what if that works well for your synth synth lines, what do you like using for the compressor on your synths? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>I have this, apex 9,000 rack. It's what actually before the, API 500 series came out, DB x invented a modular rack system for compressors and stuff. And it was just slightly deeper, slightly bigger. And it, it didn't have the 48 volts for Mike <span style="color:red" data-ts="1996.885" data-end_ts="1997.165" title="1996.885" id=c_"1996.885">__three__</span>.

His name's Mission <span style="color:red" data-ts="2013.455" data-end_ts="2013.805" title="2013.455" id=c_"2013.455">__Sense__</span> Repair. And that's kind of my mentor guy that helped me, learn how to build stuff. He laid this thing on me one day because I needed some compressors and, I didn't understand how amazing it is. Actually, the, the Apex expressors. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>Okay. They're really, really good compressors from the nineties. And I use that on baselines and I also will use it on vocals 'cause it's like the most transparent thing for vocals. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. You know, I've seen those around for years and I never have even tried one, let alone imagine, you know, that's, that's the thing, man. It's like, I'll try like any synth or any module, I'll just like eat it up. Right. But even myself as, as enlightened as I think I am, that's big quote marks around that. I, it's sort of like, oh, this works. I'm gonna stop there. You know, I don't actually take this stuff and, and really test, test it out. I'm gonna have to give that a try because like, like I said, you, you see 'em around a lot. I just hadn't, I hadn't even considered it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>Yeah. You can get like a 19 inch rack version of it for like 200 bucks on <span style="color:red" data-ts="2077.305" data-end_ts="2077.505" title="2077.305" id=c_"2077.305">__your__</span> baby's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2077.825" data-end_ts="2077.905" title="2077.825" id=c_"2077.825">__Day__</span>. I know. They're, they're next to nothing. It's unreal. So, exactly. I I, I'm curious just because it's a, it's overwhelming when I see it on video. Exactly. How many racks worth of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2092.735" data-end_ts="2093.085" title="2092.735" id=c_"2092.735">__surge__</span> stuff do you have now? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2095.665" data-end_ts="2095.885" title="2095.665" id=c_"2095.665">__Oh__</span>, snap. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It looks like roughly 10,000 <laugh>, so I'm sure it's less than that, but I can't tell you how many. It's, it, it looks amazing. I think 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>I have like 15 panels right now. Oh. And I sold, I, I sold a few and then I got this, I acquired this, monolith of five U modules that are already ified. Oh, okay. That I didn't build them. My friend David Schwan built them. And and so, and then I have like a, a euro rack that I built into a cat tower, and I'm gonna remove that from the room and I'm gonna replace it with a much bigger euro rack of DIY stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Did you say you built it into a cat tower? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>Yeah, just, you know, just to be funny for, to make the internet videos. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2142.345" data-end_ts="2142.565" title="2142.345" id=c_"2142.345">__The__</span> idea was to like, put a bunch of sensors in it to make Euro Rack models that are sensors for my cats. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, I see. Yeah. Well, and that's the perfect combination. See, since it seems like you can barely see a Euro rack video anymore that doesn't have a cat debuted in it, you know, so that's pretty great. It's a good call. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b><laugh>. Yeah, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2160.065" data-end_ts="2160.285" title="2160.065" id=c_"2160.065">__my__</span> cats love that thing. Yeah. The surge. I acquired this surge, this guy, once I started building the surges, I got this friend, he was, he is the guy that opened the first head shop in San Francisco <span style="color:red" data-ts="2171.005" data-end_ts="2171.125" title="2171.005" id=c_"2171.005">__v__</span> and he, had a shop in lower hate the tribal art store. He called me up and said, Hey man, I got a friend who has a surge for you. And I was busy building surges for other people. I didn't really wanna buy one. Right. But he is like, they basically wouldn't leave me alone. He is like, no, just, just come here, just, you know, talk to this guy. So I, I ended up talking to the guy and he had six panels of original paper face surge, and he wanted about 1100 bucks for it. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So I, once I saw the thing, I couldn't say no to him. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>And, it was covered in dirt, it had no knobs. Turns out all the boards in the, the PC boards were not even attached to the panels. They were just laying in the boats. And so, I had to, you know, completely clean all the dirt off of it. And, and I've been slowly fixing it over the years. And so I originally got the six panels and then I kind of just built the rest. And actually two of them I got from Jim O'Rourke, who's a experimentalist musician. He sent me two panels from Japan. My panel was all my eight oscillators I got from Jim O <span style="color:red" data-ts="2235.045" data-end_ts="2235.245" title="2235.045" id=c_"2235.045">__work__</span>, and they, like six of 'em worked perfectly when I got it, which is pretty cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's great. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>I'm gonna add to the surge this year. I'm gonna add the cabinet and it's gonna be the giant monster. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2246.465" data-end_ts="2246.685" title="2246.465" id=c_"2246.465">__Oh__</span>. Can't wait to see it, man. Make sure you display it prominently so that all of us, us like Surge watchers will get a nice eye full of it. That'll be great. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2256.625" data-end_ts="2256.845" title="2256.625" id=c_"2256.625">__For__</span> sure. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2257.305" data-end_ts="2257.525" title="2257.305" id=c_"2257.305">__For__</span> sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, hey man, our time is already kind of running out and there's a bunch of other stuff I actually wanted to bug you about, but, let's just, let's just focus a little bit, on you. You say that you're really focusing on music this year. So what, beyond this Kickstarter that you got rolling right now, what's some other stuff that's that's gonna be, that you're gonna be doing pulling off this year? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>Okay, my plan is from observation. You know, I can see that the best way to promote <span style="color:red" data-ts="2287.605" data-end_ts="2287.725" title="2287.605" id=c_"2287.605">__a__</span> artist is to produce original content regularly to be like a content provider. So I wanna, post a new video every month and hopefully post a new campaign every month. There's two new services that will crowdfunding, like it's a crowdfunding built in with record pressing, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2306.155" data-end_ts="2306.645" title="2306.155" id=c_"2306.155">__because__</span> it's called Q <span style="color:red" data-ts="2307.445" data-end_ts="2307.685" title="2307.445" id=c_"2307.445">__Rates__</span> is one of 'em that's, it's based in France. So they teamed up with Kickstarter. You can run a campaign to crowdfund a record to you sell presale orders of it. Essentially what we were been doing on Kickstarter, but it's, it's got the pressing built in and the best part is they're gonna press it in France and then they, they help you demo your record to the stores in Europe, and then they will drop ship your record to the stores in Europe from France, which is, you can't do that if you're in the United States. Right. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's fabulous. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>So that's gonna really fix things for us because when we were doing records, a lot of the people who were buying 'em were in Europe and they had to pay more than what the record costs for the shipping. Right. So we're gonna do that. And then I'm looking into streaming finally. I'm starting like to notice that independent rappers are making money with streaming <span style="color:red" data-ts="2355.945" data-end_ts="2356.165" title="2355.945" id=c_"2355.945">__it__</span>. You know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2356.545" data-end_ts="2356.765" title="2356.545" id=c_"2356.545">__the__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2356.865" data-end_ts="2357.085" title="2356.865" id=c_"2356.865">__the__</span>, that game actually will involve building my surge into a generative music monster. I'm gonna build a bunch of touring machines and some, Sealy eight channel quantizers. And, I'm going to make generative music and feed the streaming services nonstop. I'm gonna go to lunch and hit record and I'm gonna come back and just edit six minutes out of, out of an hour, you know, cut it into six minute pieces and send it to, to Spotify. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. There you go. That's the Spotify, the Spotify food machine. That sounds perfect. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>You know, if it requires for you to have a hundred songs in there to make any money, then we'll, we will get it to make it for itself 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. That sounds amazing. And you said already that you're planning on doing a little bit of expansion to the, to the Surge and, and to the Euro rack system. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>I want to build all the, mutable instrument stuff. I kind of was too busy building custom circuits <span style="color:red" data-ts="2415.305" data-end_ts="2415.505" title="2415.305" id=c_"2415.305">__with__</span> people when all that was coming out. Yeah, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2417.725" data-end_ts="2417.945" title="2417.725" id=c_"2417.725">__you__</span> build all that. There's like, what is that one called? Ornaments and Crime? Mm-Hmm. Man, I need two of those. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. It's pretty, pretty cool looking thing. Now, before you go, I have one more question. This is gonna be kind of my wrap up, but I think it's the thing that I'll end up being inspirational to a lot of people. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2435.855" data-end_ts="2436.345" title="2435.855" id=c_"2435.855">__Alright__</span>. So before I let you go though, I, there's one other thing I want to ask you about, and it's, you know, my hope is that, at least for me, but I think for other people, it'll be kind of inspirational in several different ways over the course of this conversation. You've talked about basically taking tools that most people use to either do really experimental sound or just to make noise, and you really focus on making them highly musical in kind of the traditional sense. You know, you talk about doing that with the surge and a lot of different tricks that, you know, different tricks that you'll use to, to use the surge, including like integrating Beat Step Pro or whatever in it. You talked about how you were doing that with house music, just with <span style="color:red" data-ts="2481.925" data-end_ts="2482.145" title="2481.925" id=c_"2481.925">__cir__</span>, circuit bent stuff, sort of like to like force yourself into the hard road of making house music, right? Yeah. What to you is sort of like the key to taking stuff that most people don't consider the right tools for that. What, what do you think is the key for making it work for more traditional music styles? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>Hmm. I think it's just, you know, you, you gotta let go of the expectations, and, you know, let go of the whole business part of it and just have some fun to do. I think in order to do all that stuff, I had to abandon my safe places. I had to let go of, you know, playing chords on the Juno 1 0 6 or the, or the FM seven plugin. And because I knew that that's the best thing that I have that can make cords, you know, I had to let go of that. So I wouldn't just be doing that same thing forever. And once I let go of those, those safe, safe places and my safe tools, then I can, you know, experiment. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's really key. Good idea. Well, Dmitri, I wanna thank you so much for taking the time. This was a fantastic talk. I, I really had a blast and it was really fun hearing about your exploits, man. It seems like you've, you've really, you're taking the world, taking on the world and really making some fantastic stuff out of it, man. Thanks. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dmitri: </b>Thank you darling. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright. And with that then, I'm going to let you have the rest of your day. We will catch you later. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Nobody: </b><i>Peace. Peace. </i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Incredible story, right? Thanks so much to Dmitri for having a chat. Remember, go over to Kickstarter, look for Slope one 14 and their Keep Flying Digital EP Kickstarter. It's really inexpensive to get in there. It'll give them a chance to touch base with you, but also <span style="color:red" data-ts="2618.765" data-end_ts="2618.925" title="2618.765" id=c_"2618.765">__give__</span> some support for this experiment, which I think is pretty interesting. One. Beyond that, I want to thank you, the listeners for showing up. I wanna thank the, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2627.905" data-end_ts="2628.125" title="2627.905" id=c_"2627.905">__so__</span> the supporters out there, people like, the folks at opia, folks at Cycling, 74 at Ableton, all the people that have been supporting me in the background all these years. I want to thank everyone for that. With that, I'm gonna let you go. I'll catch you next week. Bye.
