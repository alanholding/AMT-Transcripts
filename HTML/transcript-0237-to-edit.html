</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today I have, a very special guest. I'm actually excited, kind of following up from our last podcast where we had, Perian, I'm not sure. Is that what you call, people from Perth, Australia, <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew Fitch: </b>Something like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Perian. And, we're following up with a second. His name is Andrew Fitch and most people know him as a proprietor and mean, brain behind non-linear circuits. So, with that, let's just say hello to, to Andrew. Hey, Andrew. How's it going? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>I'm good. Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="49.735" data-end_ts="50.085" title="49.735" id=c_"49.735">__How's__</span> a good night's sleep, which is rare, <laugh>. Yeah, there 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You go. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Why don't we start off by having you, for people who aren't familiar with nonlinear surrogates, why don't you tell us a little bit about what you do and, the kind of work that you're working, the kind of work that you're doing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Yeah. I design what <span style="color:red" data-ts="68.235" data-end_ts="68.525" title="68.235" id=c_"68.235">__urac__</span> synthesizer modules. I'm pretty much a one man show, a one person show. I, I do all the designing myself and tend to come up with ideas in the shower or other places when I'm not really thinking much and things bubble up. I, I do <span style="color:red" data-ts="86.205" data-end_ts="86.325" title="86.205" id=c_"86.205">__all__</span> my own assembly here and, I get my circuit boards manufactured in China, like most companies, I guess. But I have a pick and place robot here. So I do my own assembly here. But I also, I really love, the DIY ethic. So I also sell circuit boards and panels for people to build their own modules. 'cause that's, that's where my background comes from, I guess. I, I say I'm mostly a one person show, although I have a good friend called Nathan who, he's just supported me from day one and, you know, sort of pushes me and <laugh>, I suppose, drives me along. So, he's a, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="124.725" data-end_ts="124.845" title="124.725" id=c_"124.725">__don't__</span> know, he's in the background all the time, although he doesn't actually design modules himself, but he, he comes up with ideas and comments and, you know, it gives me a lot of feedback, positive and negative as I need it. Sure. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, that's, well, it's kind of interesting hearing that because, one of the things that I've noticed from, the many podcasts I've already done is that in most cases, even people who are like solo anything, whether it's solo artists or so solo developers or whatever, there's actually always some sort of collaboration in play. If nothing else, it gives you somebody to bounce ideas off so you don't, so you can kind of make sure that you're not like, completely missing the mark. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>That's right. Yeah. <laugh>. Yeah, Nathan's got a good, you've probably heard about Nathan. He worked on the self projects, which, ah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Yeah, he was the designer for that, so, <span style="color:red" data-ts="180.125" data-end_ts="180.245" title="180.125" id=c_"180.125">__oh__</span>, interesting. But yeah, he, we've worked together now for, I don't even know how many years, seven or eight years, something like that, <laugh>. Oh, that, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's cool. You've been on my radar for a while. If nothing else, your blog, which is, nonlinear circuits.blog spot.com has always been like, or has been one of those places where I could go and sort of like stimulate some of my DIY excitement. I mean, it, it's interesting because through that site you really do, I mean, the way <span style="color:red" data-ts="211.235" data-end_ts="211.475" title="211.235" id=c_"211.235">__nonsense__</span> linear circuits comes across to me is that it actually preferences the DIY world. I mean, you provide opportunities for people to get panels and, and boards and stuff, but you really push the idea of, hey, make this stuff yourself. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Exactly. Yeah. It goes back a long way. And even you can trace this sort of, ethic, I suppose, way back to <span style="color:red" data-ts="234.845" data-end_ts="235.195" title="234.845" id=c_"234.845">__surge__</span>, Nan Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and the Surge Modular synthesizers back in the seventies, they set up in a, an abandoned house at UCLA and charged people, I think it was four or $500 to come and build their own synthesizer based on surge surges designs. 'cause that was all the idea that synths were too expensive. So, . You know, let's get synths out to the people. It was called the People Synthesizer. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, that was always inspiring. And then when I first got into DIY, the first person I got in contact was with was Ken Stone. Oh yeah. Of Cat <span style="color:red" data-ts="270.955" data-end_ts="271.235" title="270.955" id=c_"270.955">__Girl__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="271.465" data-end_ts="271.755" title="271.465" id=c_"271.465">__Syns__</span>. Right. Ken's very much was following on with that idea with his designs, and he always shared the schematics and, you know, helped people build and, you know, it was just trying to make it so it was cheap and easy to build your own synthesizer. You didn't have to fork out tons of money to get one. I feel I really just carried on with that. It even flowed into, we started running workshops here in Perth, about four years ago now. I think we're up to workshop number 42. Oh my. We do them every month and every month there's a new module. So there's, you know, a few hundred people around Perth now that have built their own <span style="color:red" data-ts="307.595" data-end_ts="307.875" title="307.595" id=c_"307.595">__since__</span>. And, <span style="color:red" data-ts="309.695" data-end_ts="309.915" title="309.695" id=c_"309.695">__you__</span> know, it's really quite nice how it's worked out. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's interesting because, ever since I, kind of first reached out to, guy Ben for listeners, he would've been our last, interview. I've been intrigued because I've been talking to different people I know either from Australia or who know the area, and, learning more about Perth, which is really, quite a peculiar place <laugh>, in, in that it is so freaking remote that, you, you all kind of end up having to depend on each other because that's about all you have is each other. Right. <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b><laugh>. Yeah. It, it's better now we've got internet and cheaper travel. But yeah, back growing up here in the, the eighties and nineties, you know, it was cheaper for us to fly up to Asia than it was to fly to Melbourne or Sydney on the other side of the country. Unreal. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's, that's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Interesting. And, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="367.365" data-end_ts="367.565" title="367.365" id=c_"367.365">__yeah__</span>, even just to drive across to, well, two days if you didn't stop in three days, if you were <span style="color:red" data-ts="372.245" data-end_ts="372.365" title="372.245" id=c_"372.245">__a__</span> normal person or straight <laugh>, unbelievable. And it wasn't much in between. So yeah, I think that remoteness sort of pushes us to, you know, into maybe extremes or, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well extremes are at least certainly a sense of community, but also it does kind of allow you to, kind of focus on your own thing instead of, necessarily blending in with what other people are doing. Right. And even, I mean, despite the internet, I, I mean, I, I certainly felt this about, about Guy and his, and, you know, some of his projects, particularly the <span style="color:red" data-ts="410.685" data-end_ts="410.965" title="410.685" id=c_"410.685">__cell__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="411.085" data-end_ts="411.205" title="411.085" id=c_"411.085">__F__</span> thing. But also as I, I kind of was looking at, you know, your projects as well. It, it's sort of like making a decision about this is what I want to do, this is what I wanna pursue. And kind of having the ability to say, and, you know, I'm not, I'm not gonna let necessarily let myself waver because I'm not gonna be influenced by a ton necessarily of outside, outside people. I mean, I think it's interesting when I look at some of your projects, I mean, so recently you post, you made a post about, about a project, <span style="color:red" data-ts="448.705" data-end_ts="448.825" title="448.705" id=c_"448.705">__a__</span> 5, 5, 5 based resonator. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And it's just like, you know, on, on one hand, I think a lot of people would say, well, you know, the 5 55 has been kind of, it, it's been explored to the teeth. We don't need to spend any more time on that. Right. But you have just like, you're like, Hey, no, this is my thing. This is the way I'm gonna take it. And you've come up with some really unique, ways to approach using that, using that particular circuit to make something kind of unique and maybe a little weird, but certainly, certainly your own. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Yeah. I, well, I, I have to be honest with the <span style="color:red" data-ts="490.025" data-end_ts="490.865" title="490.025" id=c_"490.025">__5 5, 5__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="490.965" data-end_ts="491.185" title="490.965" id=c_"490.965">__Fe__</span> It is, it is actually based on a very old design. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, no, I went, I went down that whole trail <laugh>, now I'm 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Not <laugh>. Whoops. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright. I <span style="color:red" data-ts="502.545" data-end_ts="502.705" title="502.545" id=c_"502.545">__think__</span> that all 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Back then. Yeah, I, I'd, I'd love to take full credit for that, but, no, it does actually, it was one that came out in, the series called Electro Notes. I dunno if you know of them, but, oh 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, believe me, I have a big stack of 'em in the corner being ignored. Very well, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>I mean, my, my version's sort of not straight out of there of course, but, yeah, the, the basic idea was an electro <span style="color:red" data-ts="527.105" data-end_ts="527.425" title="527.105" id=c_"527.105">__notes__</span>. So, mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. I'm sorry, I can't <laugh>. Alright, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, so I take it all back. You've been influenced by everybody and there you go. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b><laugh>. Yeah. I, I think probably where I, I don't know, I guess forged my own little path was through chaos. And that came from, I, I'm, well actually we're probably <span style="color:red" data-ts="553.485" data-end_ts="553.605" title="553.485" id=c_"553.485">__gonna__</span> go back to the beginning a bit. I got into DIY synth when I was living in Japan in about 1998 mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And it all came from I was buying, broken old cogs and stuff at junk shops and then trying to figure out how to fix them, which is, I suppose probably how my mind's always worked. You know, and eventually I discovered <span style="color:red" data-ts="575.365" data-end_ts="575.565" title="575.365" id=c_"575.365">__some__</span> DIY and just started building Ken Stone stuff. And I met a wonderful DIY group in Japan with, some really wonderful guys there that taught me lots. You might know of ho <span style="color:red" data-ts="587.045" data-end_ts="587.245" title="587.045" id=c_"587.045">__ho__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="587.305" data-end_ts="587.525" title="587.305" id=c_"587.305">__who__</span> he, he has a site called Unusual Synth Circuits, and another fellow was Moko <span style="color:red" data-ts="594.245" data-end_ts="594.525" title="594.245" id=c_"594.245">__<inaudible>__</span>. And they were just great people, really good. And, but after seven years of that in Japan, I thought, well, I, I've <span style="color:red" data-ts="602.645" data-end_ts="602.805" title="602.645" id=c_"602.645">__got__</span> to take this a bit further. So I came home and started studying electronic engineering at university and, and that was good. But you actually don't learn much electronics when you study these days. <laugh>. It's all about management. And not getting sued <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well <span style="color:red" data-ts="620.645" data-end_ts="620.925" title="620.645" id=c_"620.645">__that__</span>, and, and also one of the things I, when I've talked to people who are currently doing EE work, <span style="color:red" data-ts="626.365" data-end_ts="626.645" title="626.365" id=c_"626.365">__that__</span> it's like, and when you do talk about circuits, it's about the circuits for cell phones because that's where all the money is, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Yep. Yep. Interesting. And yeah, most people I studied with went through that whole four year degree without even looking at an op-amp or, <span style="color:red" data-ts="644.825" data-end_ts="645.045" title="644.825" id=c_"644.825">__you__</span> know, knowing what a resistant looked like sort of thing. So, but I got to the end of it. And, but one of my professors was a, a professor Herbert <span style="color:red" data-ts="653.785" data-end_ts="654.005" title="653.785" id=c_"653.785">__Yu__</span>. He was into chaos and, I, you know, heard about chaos circuits and, Ian Fritz at the time was starting to, I think he'd released his first chaos design Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Prior to, prior to him, another guy called Dan Slater had published a paper on, using LER circuits to make chaos. But I got talking with Herbert, and he was just so excited that I even knew what chaos was. <laugh> he, right immediately sort of signed me up to write a paper together. And, he sent me off to China for a conference, and then, he managed to wangle me a, a scholarship to do a PhD. So I spent the next four years after that doing my, thesis on chaos in, or ster <span style="color:red" data-ts="701.645" data-end_ts="701.845" title="701.645" id=c_"701.645">__base__</span> chaotic circuits. So I just focused on chaos for four years and especially developing chaotic circuits. And I think that's probably an area I've, yeah. I've traveled on my own way to some extent. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's interesting. Although, one of the things I'd say is that chaos is that, is that siren song that seems to have drawn a lot of people into some really interesting circuits. I know, just from people that I'd interview, whether it's like dance nelle from, snazzy Effects or <span style="color:red" data-ts="734.905" data-end_ts="735.125" title="734.905" id=c_"734.905">__Yep__</span>. You know, just different people have been really drawn in it. It's almost like, chaos behavior as opposed to either random or completely understood behavior. This chaotic behavior is one of those things that for certain kind of brain, it like trips the trigger that says, I have to get into this. Right. <laugh>. And it seems like that that's what happened to you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>I did. Yeah. I got, I got fully bitten my, you should have seen my professor. He was, he literally, he was salivating with excitement, <laugh>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="766.025" data-end_ts="766.245" title="766.025" id=c_"766.025">__he__</span>, he discovered I knew about chaos <laugh>. Yeah. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So what is 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>He, he really loves chaos. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So what, what with him, what was the exploration? What did the exploration look like there? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>We made a really good team. He basically just was like the, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="787.085" data-end_ts="787.245" title="787.085" id=c_"787.085">__mean__</span> like the Huntsman and centers us off in directions. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, but I worked with another fellow called dong, and, dong was an excellent, programmer and coder. So we would, and I'd work on the circuits. So we'd, we would develop circuits both in code on MATLAB or whatever, and, and actually build the actual circuits. And when you can get results that way, it's quite a good confirmation that way. And I don't know if you know how academia works, but it's published or perish. So, right. We, we were able to publish quite a lot of papers in a short period. Probably I could have finished my PhD in a year or a year and a half, but, I was happily sitting back with that scholarship <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Right. So what, what kind of, what were the, what were the papers that you were publishing? What were they, I mean, obviously about chaos, but what I mean focused towards what, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>All of ours were on, memories to base <span style="color:red" data-ts="843.485" data-end_ts="843.685" title="843.485" id=c_"843.485">__based__</span> circuits or mem capacitor <span style="color:red" data-ts="845.645" data-end_ts="845.885" title="845.645" id=c_"845.645">__based__</span> circuits. And that's another quite curious field. Mester were developed in theory by Leon <span style="color:red" data-ts="852.405" data-end_ts="852.605" title="852.405" id=c_"852.405">__Chua__</span> back in early seventies. And then, I think it was in, 2006, Hewitt Packard announced that they'd, developed, actual memory stuff. And the whole, you know, academic world and I guess engineering world got pretty excited about these things. 'cause Mester could, potentially rev revolutionize computing, in the sense that you, well, you can use 'em for, they remember they're states, I suppose, but it's not just on or off, but it's anywhere in between. So suddenly you have these com basically massive analog computers. And they, <span style="color:red" data-ts="891.275" data-end_ts="891.565" title="891.275" id=c_"891.275">__they__</span>, they also, they work on a nano scale and, you can build them into, I guess multi-layered structures instead of single layered structures. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>And also they don't use energy when they're remember remembering things. So there's all these great advantages to them. But it was all in theory, Uhhuh <affirmative>. Probably the, the big thing about it you might notice is that no one's actually really come out with a proper ster product in the last 10 years. I mean, I know one company's put out a chip with four ster on it, <span style="color:red" data-ts="920.185" data-end_ts="920.405" title="920.185" id=c_"920.185">__and__</span> it's $200 for one chip <laugh>, <laugh>. And, but the whole thing was that, suddenly everyone started writing papers based on the data that Hewitt Packard published. Okay. Which we did too. But 'cause we didn't have a real memory to play with, we first had to develop, circuits to simulate Sters, which we did. Okay. So we published papers on that, and then we used these circuits to make, chaos circuits, memory <span style="color:red" data-ts="950.135" data-end_ts="950.485" title="950.135" id=c_"950.135">__based__</span> chaos circuits and hyper <span style="color:red" data-ts="951.805" data-end_ts="952.125" title="951.805" id=c_"951.805">__chaos__</span> circuits. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>And then when you start digging in deeper, the next stage was mem capacitors. So we started developing mem capacitors, simulators, <laugh> <span style="color:red" data-ts="962.945" data-end_ts="963.165" title="962.945" id=c_"962.945">__mem__</span>, capacitor based chaotic circuits. And then we went to Meuc. I think we only did one on there. And I'd sort of had enough by that point, <laugh>. So I start <laugh>, I was starting to realize that this was all based on some data. That was a bit, actually, it was kind of iffy to be honest. Right. You know, 'cause they've never actually come out with anything solid to say, here it is, here's our working prototype or anything. So I think the way Mester have gone, it's changed direction a bit since <span style="color:red" data-ts="993.725" data-end_ts="993.925" title="993.725" id=c_"993.725">__those__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="993.925" data-end_ts="994.165" title="993.925" id=c_"993.925">__year__</span> Packard days. It does make my, PhD thesis completely obsolete. Like a dead end <span style="color:red" data-ts="1001.565" data-end_ts="1001.845" title="1001.565" id=c_"1001.565">__street__</span> <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. The flip side of it is, 200 years from now, people might end up saying, oh, that Andrew Guy, he really broke through on a lot of stuff, you know, but who knows? Right. We'll all be dust then, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>But <laugh> anyway, anyone can hunt it down if you want to search at the University of West, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1019.765" data-end_ts="1020.045" title="1019.765" id=c_"1019.765">__just__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1020.045" data-end_ts="1020.285" title="1020.045" id=c_"1020.045">__telling__</span> <laugh>

<b>Darwin: </b>It sounds really, really fun. So how did you get into, how did you go from a bizarro and, sort of like very theoretical paper writing for your PhD to designing circuit boards for musicians? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>I mean, I was already into <span style="color:red" data-ts="1038.725" data-end_ts="1039.005" title="1038.725" id=c_"1038.725">__sense__</span>, and already into designing circuits. And, it's one of those things that's a complete obsession. So yeah, any circuit I looked at, well, I, or <laugh>, any paper I'm reading, I I'm thinking, can I make a module out of this? Right. And and you know, I've got literally boxes of, I don't <span style="color:red" data-ts="1060.045" data-end_ts="1060.125" title="1060.045" id=c_"1060.045">__know__</span>, I call 'em my boxes of dumb ideas, but <laugh>. But, yeah, there's lots of ones that didn't work. But for every, I don't know, every 10 or every 20, you try, you, you find one that's kind of, you know, interesting or, you know, of course you have to, massage it somewhat to make it suitable for use as a synth module. But, that's all just part of the process. And yeah, there's <laugh> there's quite a backlog of things that need massaging, I suppose, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I suppose. But now the flip side of it is though you have kind of developed a, a business model, which is, you know, maybe no circuit is too bizarre to at least give a try. Right? I mean, if you're doing, I mean, you, you talk about doing like, you know, you're on workshop number 42 and you're doing like a new circuit a month. I mean, you're gonna run out of like, here's a fat sounding filter. You're gonna run out of those pretty quickly. Right. <laugh>. And at some point you have to be like, well, here's the, here's the module that's simulates a spinning top or something like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Oh, that's a good idea. <laugh>. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>There you go. There's that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1128.365" data-end_ts="1128.525" title="1128.365" id=c_"1128.365">__one__</span>, that one gets my name on it. <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b><laugh>. Well, that was something with the workshops, that was a real driving force. And that's why I think I actually posted up a new module for sale last night. I noticed it's number 77 on the list. That's, the workshops really push me to come up with a new module every month. And, you know, maybe to some extent it's quantity over quality, but I, I try and make sure everything works. And, you know, <laugh>, it's not too much for disaster, but the workshops are a good, a good way of testing new modules as well. So we usually build it at the workshop before I release it as a on general sale. Sure. 'cause at the workshop we, I see 30 to 40 of them get built and, I test them and I can see where people have problems or I could see where I might've been able to improve the design. So you get, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You get 30 to 40 people coming to these workshops. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Yeah. <laugh>, it's really full on <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>How, how big, how big is Perth? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>I think it's just top 2 million people now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. Because I'll tell you, in a city that size, in most places, trying to get 10 people together seems to be an awful lot of work. So again, it seems like there's kind of this unique thing in the, in the air there that, that <laugh> causes this community to, to exist. It's really kind of cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1210.505" data-end_ts="1210.725" title="1210.505" id=c_"1210.505">__And__</span>, and it's not, of course it's not the same 30 to 40 people every month. Right. You know, it's like, our workshop last week, I think there was maybe 10 new people that hadn't come before. Interesting. So, and always the idea of the workshops is too, is it's not just buy my stuff, but it's, just to help people get their skills up Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and get the confidence to build modules and then they can just stay home and, you know, ordering kits or boards or even work on their own designs. And that's what a lot of people have ended up doing. So, so we've got, there's probably two or three people that have come from day one, but, otherwise it's kind of a general rotation of new people coming in and other people dropping off as they've, you know, they've got their confidence and skills up and then move on. So, sure. Which is how I've always wanted it to work. So it's been really good. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So when people, well, I, I'm kind of curious about this idea of workshops, building workshops, and especially ones that are kind of ongoing. So you're saying that like there's maybe 10 new people each time. I mean, are you having to sort of like, each month kind of had to sit, have a special corner where it's like, okay, we're gonna learn how to do solder. Here's how much solder you put on the joint. You know, is it like every month having to kind of go through that process with people? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Yep. Luckily Nathan does that <laugh>, ah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Nathan shaves the day. Alright. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b><laugh>, Nathan's a really good friend. He's, so he's, he's, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>He's, he's got it down pat. That's cool. He, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1303.975" data-end_ts="1304.215" title="1303.975" id=c_"1303.975">__yeah__</span>, he's got his spiel for getting people to start soloing to build their first module, which is always a power supply. So yeah, he's got that pretty smooth. We have another fellow that comes to the workshops called Steve, who always helps out every month as well. Yeah. Whereas I'm at, I'm usually pretty busy at the workshops, just testing modules. Oh, okay. So we, we arrive at four in the afternoon and sort of an hour or two to set up and quick dinner and then from 6:00 PM it doesn't stop until about one in the morning. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. Is this like a maker makerspace kind of a place that you work out of? Or where do you, where do you do these? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>It's a hacker space called Artifactory. Oh, okay. And, they're in a warehouse in an industrial zone. You know, they've got laser cutters, they've got lots of benches and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1350.935" data-end_ts="1351.255" title="1350.935" id=c_"1350.935">__solar__</span> irons and good lighting and, they love having us 'cause we're, you know, we're riding with their, what they're about 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>With the aesthetic of it. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Yeah. And they also run a monthly, which Nathan and I also involved in this, a monthly noise show called Noise Machine. And that's been running now for, I think it's seven years or something. And, every month it's eight people get up and <laugh> do whatever they like for 10 minutes each. So it's, you know, you can be as loud or obnoxious as you want, but it's only 10 minutes. Everyone enjoys it. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well that's a, that's the thing. I mean, if, if it's 10 minutes each, that means really you can swig a beer and, and then it's time for the next person. So no matter how bad it is, it's only gonna last you one beer. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Yeah. Yeah. And, but you know, there's been some fantastic shows on there's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1406.085" data-end_ts="1406.375" title="1406.085" id=c_"1406.085">__Yeah__</span>. Some less than Fantastic and some completely weird and <laugh>. That's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Really cool. Now, one of the things I noticed is that, you know, you do do fully fleshed out, PCBs and panels and stuff, for all of your circuits. Is that when you do these workshops, are you, are you bringing in these boards and stuff? Are you manufacturing stuff in turnaround that quickly? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>For the workshops we bring in, circuit boards and panels and we make, again, with Nathan, we, he comes over one day a week before the workshop or so, and we make all the component kits and and then at the workshop we, these days it's all surface bound and I take my reflow oven into the workshop. Oh, interesting. And so we, so we stencil on the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1457.765" data-end_ts="1457.965" title="1457.765" id=c_"1457.765">__solar__</span> paste and people just drop the parts on the boards and they cook them. And, yeah. Then once it's cooked and cooled down, they put on the, the pots and the jacks, the LEDs and bolt it together. And doing it this way, we, we have a pretty good success rate. Dunno if I'd wanna put a number on it, but, you know, sort of four out <span style="color:red" data-ts="1478.125" data-end_ts="1478.245" title="1478.125" id=c_"1478.125">__of__</span> five works straight away and maybe one in five just needs a, you know, a minor tweak to get it working. But generally everyone goes home with a working module at the end of the night. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well I think that's pretty remarkable though because, I mean, one of the things I would say most people are, are scared shitless by the idea of dealing with SMT and, and it, and it's like you're not only helping people do it, but making it sound like it's, it's pretty easy to pull off. That's really great. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Yeah. It, it's one of those things that until you try it, you don't realize Yeah. How easy it is. And even myself, I was reluctant for a long time. You know, I was, I don't know, I was pretty much stuck in the seventies, I think <span style="color:red" data-ts="1523.335" data-end_ts="1523.555" title="1523.335" id=c_"1523.335">__has__</span> to be all analog <span style="color:red" data-ts="1524.355" data-end_ts="1524.515" title="1524.355" id=c_"1524.355">__and__</span> through <span style="color:red" data-ts="1524.755" data-end_ts="1524.995" title="1524.755" id=c_"1524.755">__hole__</span> <laugh>. Right, right. I'm not that old, but it's just, I think you, you're nostalgic for that childhood time. So for me it's the seventies, but once I started using <span style="color:red" data-ts="1535.395" data-end_ts="1536.475" title="1535.395" id=c_"1535.395">__S-S-M-D-I__</span> realized it's way quicker to work with even soldering by hand. When you are using it with an oven, it's almost foolproof uhhuh, you know, everything just works. Right. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now the, the front panels that you do, are those just, is that circuit board printed as well? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Yes. Oh, okay. Yeah. The panels are, yeah, they're done as a two <span style="color:red" data-ts="1558.805" data-end_ts="1559.025" title="1558.805" id=c_"1558.805">__mil__</span> thick circuit boards. Oh, okay. And I do a, a little, fiddling of the JBA files so that the actual lettering is the, the copper traces rather than ink. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Nice. And 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>And then that's finished with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1575.025" data-end_ts="1575.145" title="1575.025" id=c_"1575.025">__a__</span>, what they call a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1575.865" data-end_ts="1576.065" title="1575.865" id=c_"1575.865">__NI__</span> gold. So it's gold plated copper for the lettering. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, that's gotta light up pretty nicely. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Yeah. It's quite durable. There's good and bad things about the using circuit boards as panels. They're actually quite strong. They're difficult to break, but probably, depending on manufacturer, you get a large amount of them coming, arriving scratched or scuffed. 'cause they're a bit rough at the factory 'cause they don't care about them being panels to them. It's just circuit boards. So, sure. I, I've found good manufacturers now and, I probably have about a 10% reject rate, which is pretty much what any manufacturer has, whether, you know, from wherever they get their panels made, but, in the early days. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Do you see much variation like either in the panel color or like the thicknesses or any of that? Or are they pretty uniform 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>The thickness? You <span style="color:red" data-ts="1628.845" data-end_ts="1629.005" title="1628.845" id=c_"1628.845">__can__</span>, you always set the thickness of what you want it to be. So that's the same I always choose to mill. Okay. But yeah, I, I normally just get the white panels, but I've seen at least four different shades of wine. <laugh> <laugh>. Yeah. So, but it's not, you know, I don't fuss about these things too much to be honest. It's, you know, it's, how does it sound in the end? It's the main point right 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now. A long time ago, I, I used to work with, grant Richter on, on stuff and we actually toyed around with the idea of using circuit board, circuit board material because especially back then trying to get a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1667.685" data-end_ts="1667.965" title="1667.685" id=c_"1667.685">__metal__</span>, a metal, a metal place to do panels was just obnoxiously hard. They just didn't want to do deal with the small quantities and anything that had any kind of unique look to it. Right. They didn't want to hear about it. But at the time there was, there was a lot of concerns about, well, you know, do you have to worry about them shattering or is it going to flex too much or whatever. Now one of the things I notice about a lot of your panels is they're relatively full. So I imagine like between the jacks and the pots, that keeps everything pretty bolted in and pretty well solid just from, all of the connections to the circuit board. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Yeah. Yeah. It's, once it's all put together and in the, in your case, there's, there's pretty much no flex at all. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>I think you'd have a hard time making it flex, I think. Yeah. It's, I'm, I'm testing right now actually <laugh>, <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You're pressing on it with your finger <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>I can't see any bending <laugh>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1731.795" data-end_ts="1732.085" title="1731.795" id=c_"1731.795">__Yeah__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1732.085" data-end_ts="1732.325" title="1732.085" id=c_"1732.085">__It's__</span> interesting. I think it's really cool. And they really look sharp, that, that white coloring is, is pretty slick. Now I, I also see that in addition to the PCBs and the panels, you also do sell assembled modules. Now, in your experience, what is the percentage of people that are wanting to DIY versus the percentage of people that just want a module just build it for me and send it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Hmm. Maybe two to one. I haven't thought 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>About that. One. Two to 1D IY. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Yeah. Mostly DIY for me, I think, I guess obviously I'd probably attract DIY more than people that wanna assemble. And also I don't really, how <span style="color:red" data-ts="1775.325" data-end_ts="1775.445" title="1775.325" id=c_"1775.325">__to__</span> say, I don't really advertise or push the assembled stuff that, well, I think people have to look for it. <laugh>, uhhuh, <affirmative>, <laugh>. I'm not sure why I just have this, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1785.685" data-end_ts="1785.925" title="1785.685" id=c_"1785.685">__dunno__</span>. Yeah. I'm not sure why I don't do that, but it's maybe 'cause it's a lot of work <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. But the DIY ones are full on surface mount, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Yep. Yep. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's interesting. I, I have to admit that, you know, I, and maybe I'm just, maybe it's just my age Right. But I can really imagine I've got a box full of all the resistors and capacitors and everything I need for a through hole kit job. I wouldn't even hardly know how to start with SM smt. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Right. Okay. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, no, I mean, it's just like, help me, help me understand what is, you've, you went through the transition moving from through <span style="color:red" data-ts="1828.675" data-end_ts="1828.955" title="1828.675" id=c_"1828.675">__hole__</span> to surface mount This, I mean, how do you even buy resistors? Right? I mean there's, there's these little things that look like bugs. I mean, I, I sound like old Man of the sea here, so pardon me. Right. <laugh>. But, how do you, do you, do you like buy a reel of 'em? Do you buy, like how, how do you even get the parts? I don't even really get it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Okay. I, I mean, I'm a bit more probably extreme than most, but I buy all my resistors on reels. Usually it's about 4,000 <span style="color:red" data-ts="1861.215" data-end_ts="1861.435" title="1861.215" id=c_"1861.215">__to__</span> reel. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, the average cost is about $10 for a reel. Okay. But otherwise there's a, a good online store is called, tater Tater Electronics, T-A-Y-D-A. And they're very cheap and you can buy resistors in, surface mount resistors in blocks of I think 50 or a hundred. It's about a dollar for a hundred, so 1 cent each. Oh, okay. And the only sort of special tool you really want is, some nice tweezers and if your eyes are getting on a bit, maybe some like a watchmaker's visor, that sort of thing. Which I use, I have one pretty much permanently attached to my head these days. <laugh> <laugh>, it's, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1901.415" data-end_ts="1901.635" title="1901.415" id=c_"1901.415">__you__</span> know, that or some sort of magnifying lamp. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Not everyone needs one, but I certainly do uhhuh <affirmative> and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1907.985" data-end_ts="1908.595" title="1907.985" id=c_"1907.985">__soldering__</span> iron. Yeah, a fine point is nice to have, but it's actually not that critical. I think more just to be able to work quickly is more important. I always have two ions on my desk and one is a fine point and the other's quite blunt. But, I tend to use a blunt one 'cause it heats things up much more quickly. And so I can work faster. So when you're salting on surface <span style="color:red" data-ts="1928.885" data-end_ts="1929.235" title="1928.885" id=c_"1928.885">__mount__</span> parts, you just go through the board and put a blob of shoulder on one side, like each surface mount resistor or will have two pads. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So you put a bit of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1940.195" data-end_ts="1940.275" title="1940.195" id=c_"1940.195">__shoulder__</span> on one pad, grab your resistor with the tweezers and put <span style="color:red" data-ts="1944.075" data-end_ts="1944.235" title="1944.075" id=c_"1944.075">__it__</span> in position. So sort of sitting up on top of the lump of shoulder, reheat the shoulder so the resistor plops down onto the pad and then just let it cool down and, sold up the other side. And, that's pretty much it. <laugh>, it's, there's no trimming of leads or anything or it's Right. It's very, very fast. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. Yeah, I, you know, it's funny because I, I have to admit that surface mount is one of those things that's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1971.845" data-end_ts="1971.925" title="1971.845" id=c_"1971.845">__an__</span>, there's an intimidation factor to it that's made it really hard for me to consider going there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>And I, I actually converted slowly from through hole. So you can sort of see through my modules, the early stuff's all through hole. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And then you start to see there's a few a hundred K surface mount resistors on there and, they're what's called 1 2 0 6 size, which is sort of the biggest surface mount size. Okay. And, and then there's a few more sort of 10 Ks in one K. It's like the really common values that you use a lot. But still the chips were through hole. And, but then eventually I went to the, second larger size, which is oh 8 0 5, and that's quite easy to handle. And, the Soic chips, which are also, they're the largest of the surface mount chips. Okay. I don't go any smaller than that, but there are other ones that do. You can still hand <span style="color:red" data-ts="2026.365" data-end_ts="2026.605" title="2026.365" id=c_"2026.365">__sold__</span> the smaller ones, but it's not quite as easy <laugh>. Right. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>One of the things I noticed when I was playing around with some, circuit design of my own is that, I was, I was starting to see myself being hampered because especially with some certain kinds of logic chips and e <span style="color:red" data-ts="2045.685" data-end_ts="2045.845" title="2045.685" id=c_"2045.685">__to__</span> D converters and stuff, the things that had the capabilities that I wanted were actually only available in the SOIC format. And the through <span style="color:red" data-ts="2057.765" data-end_ts="2058.005" title="2057.765" id=c_"2057.765">__hole__</span> stuff was a lot of times kind of a dumbed down version. It was, it was a little, it was, it was kind of disconcerting for me. And again, I was like, I, I was in intimidated right away from it. It was, it was a little rough. So I'm curious, a little bit about your design process. I mean, you, you dropped a couple of names that I think are gonna be pretty familiar to people in the module world. I mean, having, having a background sort of like embracing Ken Stone's work and Ian Fritz's work, I mean, these are people that have kind of this really long history Well, and, and the electro notes, papers. Right. These are all things that have really a long history in the modular world. Is there anybody, or is there, is there any, is there anything that was maybe less common but but equally, equally important for you as your development as a designer? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Prob probably Serge and Ken. Definitely. They're the main two. I mean, Serge not so much for his designs 'cause trying to get around your head around S'S designs was very difficult when you're, when you're new to this game. Uhhuh <affirmative>, yeah, he just, I I guess he didn't come outta it as an electronic and engineer. I think he was a mathematician from <span style="color:red" data-ts="2138.405" data-end_ts="2138.525" title="2138.405" id=c_"2138.405">__the__</span>, I can't remember now. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But, so his way of designing was really left field. And, I can sort of, I get them now, but at the time I'd look at Serge's stuff and it was just, it was just a mystery. <laugh>. Yeah. <laugh>. But it was his, his ethic and his, his view of sense and how people should be able to access 'em <span style="color:red" data-ts="2161.645" data-end_ts="2161.765" title="2161.645" id=c_"2161.645">__that__</span> I always liked. And but also his idea of how signal flow works. I think that was important. And, yeah, similar with Ken Stone, but, outside of those two, honestly the biggest influences on my life would be probably John Waters <laugh>. Really? Yeah. The films of John Waters. <laugh> <laugh>.

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's, that was an unexpected turn. I didn't see that one coming at all. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2192.955" data-end_ts="2193.245" title="2192.955" id=c_"2192.955">__Yeah__</span>. Just that whole, yeah, let's get weird and love it. And, you know, as long as you're not hurting anyone else, do whatever really turns you on. That sort of thing. That's, that's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Awesome. That's a great, that's a great thing to hear. It's, I'm sure he would be pretty stunned to, to actually hear that himself. So that's, that's really cool. So our time is, we're getting close to the end of our time, but before we go, I, I would like to, I would like to ask you a little bit about how you would, you had a very kind of, peculiar way of getting into what you do. I'm, and I don't think that you would necessarily say that other people that wanted to follow your path into module making should like work on a PhD in chaos theory <laugh>. Right. But, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b><laugh> definitely not. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But I'm curious, what, what do you think now are the, are the paths that would help people who wanted to get, you know, want to go beyond building modules and maybe get into doing design? I mean, you're a very prolific designer. What do you think, would, what do you think are some of the trails that can help people now who want to get into design themselves? Where would you suggest that they look? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Yeah, I, as much as I pretty much, well I do keep all my designs in analog. I, I sort of do acknowledge that, the digital side of things is, you know, where it's, it's probably the big future of synths. Well obviously it is. So learn how to code really well <laugh>, but, but get your ideas from, from nature, look at natural systems and how, and you mentioned about a spinning top. That's a beautiful idea. That sort of thing. Bouncing balls, how trees grow, evolution if you believe in things like that. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know, what dogs do when they go for a walk. Anything like that is, is is a great place, a great source of ideas. And that's where I'm always looking is natural systems. Yeah. So I can't, that, that's probably the best way to work, I think. And we probably don't need any more LFOs in the world. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Probably not. You're probably right about that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b><laugh>. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>One, you know, kind of harking back to how we first started our conversation, which was talking about the work that you had done with, with guy on his <span style="color:red" data-ts="2345.925" data-end_ts="2346.165" title="2345.925" id=c_"2345.925">__cell__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2346.245" data-end_ts="2346.365" title="2346.245" id=c_"2346.245">__F__</span> project. One of the things I noticed is that you actually put out a voice that was related to a voice board that was related to the synth that you developed for his thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>How much, how much of that was sort of like a combination of existing circuits and how much stuff did you have to develop specifically for that project? I hate to go back to that because that's like a previous conversation, but I'll tell you what I mean, there have been few projects I've talked about that simultaneously intrigued me and made me want to throw up a little bit, you know, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>There's, I have a, I have this like, bizarre interest in what's going on there. <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b><laugh>, the novel part of the Cell <span style="color:red" data-ts="2393.415" data-end_ts="2393.535" title="2393.415" id=c_"2393.415">__F__</span> project was the, the neural interface circuits. Which if you ever look at pictures of it, that's the big blank column in the center of it. Okay. With all the red, red twinkly lights, the two panels that I released from that, we call the voice panel and the action panel. Mostly they were a result of what Darren Moore, who was the, the musical director of the project, what he wanted and what kind of sounds he wanted. So he was, he had a lot of input on what modules went <span style="color:red" data-ts="2422.655" data-end_ts="2422.775" title="2422.655" id=c_"2422.655">__onto__</span> those panels. Of course, I stuck in the odd chaos circuit here <laugh>. Right. Because I just can't help myself. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's what, that's what you do. Right, exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b><laugh> backup, I, I told him, I said, you might need it for backup <span style="color:red" data-ts="2436.635" data-end_ts="2436.855" title="2436.635" id=c_"2436.635">__if__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2437.025" data-end_ts="2437.375" title="2437.025" id=c_"2437.025">__sales__</span> die <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Nice, nice. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2441.435" data-end_ts="2441.655" title="2441.435" id=c_"2441.435">__The__</span> that's plan B, your plan B modules. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Yeah. Yeah. The interface stuff that was, that was actually the bulk of the work that took quite a lot of to develop and how to communicate with the dish full of guys neurons. Yeah. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's, that's amazing stuff. Well, Andrew, I want to thank you so much for taking the time. This is a very fun talk and, very revealing and I mean, you actually have sort of like demystified the surface mount thing a little bit for me. So I have to tell you that's, when I looked at your, at your projects, I was like, I could never do that 'cause surface mount. Right. But you've actually made it seem pretty approachable and, and the fact that you're running workshops as often as you are and and are seeing the success, you are kind of tells a story as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Thanks so much for talking to me too. It's been a pleasure. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright, so with that then, I am going to let you have the rest of your day. Thank you so much. We'll have a good one. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Thank you. And thanks everyone for listening too. Alright, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Bye now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Andrew: </b>Okay, bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, Minnie, thanks to Andrew for the great chat. It was a lot of fun to get caught up, learn a little bit more about what he does and how he does it. It's a lot of fun. I also want to, thank all of the people that have been supporting me, folks over at opia, folks at CDM, people like the my Friends and coworkers at Cyclone 74, and the folks at a Ableton, all the people that have really been kicking in help. I really appreciate it. I want to thank you, the listeners also for your thumbs up, your backpacks, your likes, your, great reviews, everything, it all really helps to make this thing come together. And thank you so much for sharing this with the people that you know as well. That's the thing that really grows the crowd. But with that, I want to thank you and we'll catch you next time around. Bye.
