<b>Darwin: </b>This episode of Art Music Technology is sponsored in part by Chris Coleman, <span style="color:red" data-ts="9.155" data-end_ts="9.445" title="9.155" id=c_"9.155">__Lale__</span> Marin, two university professors and artists based out of Denver, Colorado. If you get a chance to check out their work, do so, it's amazing stuff. I want to thank them for their support of the podcast and for you listening. And now let's hear an interview with Alex McClain. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today I have the great pleasure of speaking to Alex McClain. I'm going to kind of punt on talking about what he does because he does a ton of things. But I will put out there that he's the, he calls himself the instigator behind, title, which, as everyone knows, I recently did a, an interview with Mike <span style="color:red" data-ts="51.495" data-end_ts="51.845" title="51.495" id=c_"51.495">__Knick__</span>, and we kind of went down the title path there. But I'm just really excited to talk to him because he is done a bunch of other stuff. So let's just jump right into it. Hey, Alex, how are you doing this morning? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alex McLean: </b>Yeah, I'm good thanks. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm great. Thanks a lot for taking time outta your schedule to have a chat. I really appreciate it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alex: </b>Oh, my pleasure. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You've been a, you've been a busy man. You've, <laugh>, you've had your fingers in a lot of stuff recently. Why don't we, kick it off by having you explain the things that you do? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alex: </b>Yeah, it's quite hard to explain 'cause there's a lot of different threads to it, really. I, I quite like what my friend <span style="color:red" data-ts="88.305" data-end_ts="88.525" title="88.305" id=c_"88.305">__and__</span> collaborator Dave Griffith calls himself, which is a generalist, sort of, a resistance to, pigeonholing, which is nice. I guess I like that sort of interdisciplinary approach very much. Instead of sort of making yourself one thing instead, try and make a new space for things happen in between things <laugh>. But I suppose the different things I'm involved with involve, organizing events, research and making music and making software, but all these things connect together. Yeah, I guess my day job is as a researcher, so that's half my time. I work for the Deutsches Museum, which is in Munich, although I live in Sheffield. And that's a project that's about pattern, but in particular patterns of ancient textiles. So I'm using live coding techniques, which I've developed through music making for researching pattern in textiles. So that's one thread, <laugh>. Wow. <span style="color:red" data-ts="153.075" data-end_ts="153.565" title="153.075" id=c_"153.075">__Another__</span> <laugh>, and another one is Organizing Algae Festival. So I've done that two years in a row now. And that's the Festival of Algorithmic and Mechanical Movement, which connects with textiles, but also music, obviously. And another thing I do is organize <span style="color:red" data-ts="170.665" data-end_ts="170.885" title="170.665" id=c_"170.665">__our__</span> graves. That's where people dance to algorithmic dance music. And another thing is, yeah, making Tidal Cycles, which is now a free open source software project, which Mike talked about quite a lot a couple of weeks ago. There's probably other things, but, yeah, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that just makes me want to take a nap, just hearing about it. That's, it's quite a list of stuff. <span style="color:red" data-ts="197.755" data-end_ts="198.045" title="197.755" id=c_"197.755">__Yeah__</span>. I wanna talk about all this stuff, but the one thing that I didn't actually know about was this researcher work. Can you, what is the name of the museum again? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alex: </b>It's the Deutsches Museum. It's like a big museum in Munich. It has an island to itself for this, yeah. A huge science museum, but there's a research institute within it. Wow. And I'm part of the Penelope project. So Penelope is, this mythological figure from ancient Greece who wove by day and, and wove by night. So the project's sort of partly about <span style="color:red" data-ts="232.505" data-end_ts="232.725" title="232.505" id=c_"232.505">__end__</span> making, about how you take things apart in order to understand them, I suppose. Interesting. And yeah, and also how you make things not by having this genius idea that you somehow get out into the world, but rather how you make things by working within the world and within material which connects with live coding. Because for me, that's what live coding is about. It's using code as a material to find ideas by, working with the code and seeing what it suggests to you, rather than being this genius who dreams up this amazing music and types it in. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well that it is, and, and also it kind of, this idea of this idea of the way that textiles are created, you know, which is you have these elemental things of threads, which don't really have much of a physical property at all, but ends up becoming literally the material of, of creation. That that is sort of like, almost a metaphor for coding in general. It's interesting. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alex: </b>Yeah. I think it, yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="304.465" data-end_ts="304.685" title="304.465" id=c_"304.465">__But__</span> the more I work on this project, the more I realize that it's not so much a metaphor. If you see how weavers or knitters work, they work with codes, whether they're grids showing interaction between threads or, knitting patterns, which have yeah, more or less showing complete system of notation. They're working in the abstract. And, when you're working at a loom, you can be really surprised at the, the images that come from these patterns. There's a real interesting abstraction there. And even the notion of odd and even in is sort of central to weaving and also central to early mathematics. And so you can see that ideas of algorithms, really seem to have come from the actual physical process of weaving. So yeah, I guess this project is really getting at, the sort of genesis of computation from textiles in a way 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's fascinating. What does, you said that you actually are able to kind of bring some of your live coding techniques into play on this. What does, in, in what way is does that afford you? Opportunity, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alex: </b>I guess it comes down to sharing, an idea which is, sort of core to live coding. We project our screen so people can read the code, and understand the idea, well, they don't have to read the code, but somehow you are, externalizing part of your thinking process and making it visible. And this is what we want to do with the Penelope project, is because if you watch <span style="color:red" data-ts="404.695" data-end_ts="404.975" title="404.695" id=c_"404.695">__someone__</span> working at Aloo, it looks very mundane, and repetitive, and in a way it is. But we want to actually show the thinking process that went into setting up the loom and, and the thinking process that goes into improvising at the Loom. So we want to live code a loom. We're going to make mechanical weavers and work out how to live code them. And say it, it seems quite a strange sort of thing to be involved in weaving when I've, my background's in music technology. But <span style="color:red" data-ts="437.895" data-end_ts="438.215" title="437.895" id=c_"437.895">__there__</span>, there is a very strong connection there when you think about pattern in music and pattern in textiles and, and the abstraction involved in both of them. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And you also talk about the idea of <span style="color:red" data-ts="449.805" data-end_ts="450.095" title="449.805" id=c_"449.805">__idea__</span> improvising at the loom. Is that something that when you're looking at these textiles, it's clear that people are doing, it's sort of like making stuff up on the fly? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alex: </b>I don't <span style="color:red" data-ts="460.175" data-end_ts="460.255" title="460.175" id=c_"460.175">__know__</span>. When, when you are, working at the loom, sometimes things are so constrained by the setting up of the loom uhhuh, but if you look at the whole process that <span style="color:red" data-ts="470.055" data-end_ts="470.335" title="470.055" id=c_"470.055">__Sure__</span>. Setting up the loom and then working at it, you're sort of creating these creative constraints and then working within them <laugh>. So yeah, <span style="color:red" data-ts="478.835" data-end_ts="479.055" title="478.835" id=c_"478.835">__the__</span>, there, there is improvisation there, but like all improvisation, it is quite constrained in different ways. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="485.945" data-end_ts="486.295" title="485.945" id=c_"485.945">__We've__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="486.295" data-end_ts="486.415" title="486.295" id=c_"486.295">__been__</span> a structure, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alex: </b>Yeah. But there's different ways of weaving. So there's also tablet weaving, which is very open and, and very strange actually. <laugh>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="495.525" data-end_ts="495.815" title="495.525" id=c_"495.525">__when__</span> you try and understand what's going on when you're flipping and rotating these cards is very surprising what the patterns that you get out just by turning a card a different way each time. I'd say tablet weaving for me is where improvisation can really bring up surprises. But, we're trying to do as much weaving as possible, but I'm really not an expert weaver, so probably better to Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Well, it sounds, it sounds pretty amazing and, you know, you talk about that <span style="color:red" data-ts="521.315" data-end_ts="521.535" title="521.315" id=c_"521.315">__in__</span> your day gig. I mean, that sounds like, that sounds like an obsessive kind of a fun thing to do, just, just because I mean, it it has to be, yeah. Pretty amazing to see the end result of that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alex: </b>Yeah. Yeah. I'm really, lucky to be involved in this project. She's led by <span style="color:red" data-ts="537.845" data-end_ts="537.965" title="537.845" id=c_"537.845">__a__</span> song called Alan <span style="color:red" data-ts="539.275" data-end_ts="539.565" title="539.275" id=c_"539.275">__SIUs__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="539.595" data-end_ts="539.885" title="539.595" id=c_"539.595">__Luke__</span>. So it's, sort of come from her obsession. But, I'm very happy to be sharing with it. And I find it's also a very nice way into explaining what I do as well to people who maybe aren't programmers. So if I talk about music in terms of a knitting pattern, people can sort of hold onto <span style="color:red" data-ts="557.485" data-end_ts="557.725" title="557.485" id=c_"557.485">__that__</span> idea whether or not they've done knitting. It's sort of something, it also gives a different frame, I think, something that's much more culturally grounded over a longer period of time than computer programming, which, I think a lot of people are still quite scared about in some way, this, this, strange benign influence on our lives. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, indeed. Well, and let's talk about, about the musical implications of this. I mean, you talk about doing algo raves, which, you say are people who basically it's, it's the presentation of algorithmic dance music to a certain extent. There's, there's a pattern orientation of dance music almost by definition, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alex: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What is it in your mind that makes algorithmic dance music a particular genre, <span style="color:red" data-ts="610.005" data-end_ts="610.125" title="610.005" id=c_"610.005">__a__</span> particular area of interest? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alex: </b>Well, I suppose the dance is really important because you can, if you're moving to music, you can listen to it in a different way. It sort of becomes part of the listening sort of, you can give it a certain grounding by literally stepping into it. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So for me, I, I think it's a way of listening to music, which is com complex in a rhythmic way, but sort of exploring it through movement. And, and the algorithmic side sort of gives you a way into creating that complexity, sort of creating that sort of sonic, discreet, environment where it's slightly beyond what is sort of, I don't know. It's a way of making these slightly beyond your imagination in a way, because by making these patterns, these interference patterns or these <span style="color:red" data-ts="666.515" data-end_ts="666.805" title="666.515" id=c_"666.515">__comp__</span>, yeah, well, they can be very simple interactions between different sequences, but they can create very complex results. I suppose that's how they sit quite nicely together, the sort of strange alien rhythms and, not just sitting down and trying to comprehend them, but actually trying to pick apart and, and sort of giving like that kind of rhythmic grounding, working out where the ones are, you know, <laugh> by, by actually moving to them. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I think, I think also one of the things that, that dancing environment does to that is it kind of helps a group form an understanding of the music, right? I mean, I know this, whether I think of like going to raves or going to, other kinds of performances or whatever, when people are dancing. Now, you're not only informed by the music and what the performer is doing, but by also all the people in your environment. And what you see is sometimes with more complex rhythms or something people, the, the group will choose to like, follow kind of a sub rhythm or sort of like a multiple of a rhythm or something like that, just because that ends up being the natural rhythm of the group of people that are there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alex: </b>Yeah. That's <span style="color:red" data-ts="745.085" data-end_ts="745.205" title="745.085" id=c_"745.085">__a__</span>, that's a really nice thought, I think, and that's maybe where the rave part of our grave comes in. Although if you look at our grave, they're not usually comparable to a real rave sometimes, but <laugh>. But yeah, there, <span style="color:red" data-ts="758.525" data-end_ts="758.845" title="758.525" id=c_"758.525">__there__</span>, there's that kind of notion of the, an anonymity of the dj, an old school rave, and this sort of collective feeling of being in a large group of people and, and yeah, it's about each other rather than this sort of stage audience scenario. Right. And yeah, you, you, you are sort of part of the performance, really, or I think people are always part of a performance, but, but sort of, is much more tangible, <span style="color:red" data-ts="790.025" data-end_ts="790.245" title="790.025" id=c_"790.025">__is__</span> sort of, looking at each other and responding to each other. Sounds a bit cheesy, but I don't know. I think there's something there definitely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, well, it may be cheesy, but it's still, it, it's sort of like matches kind of the human experience too, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alex: </b>That's, I guess that's the ideal. But, sometimes at an out, often an out <span style="color:red" data-ts="811.125" data-end_ts="811.325" title="811.125" id=c_"811.125">__grave__</span>, it doesn't quite work out that way. <laugh>, <laugh>, I mean, especially with the, this projection, this sort of rectangular projection behind the performer, it feels sometimes like a PowerPoint presentation or something. Yeah. Especially if the performer's sitting down. So I'll try and do things like project on multiple walls, even if it's the same screen, just to create the idea that you are inside the algorithm rather than watching it in a cinema or something. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's actually a really smart, well, 'cause the other thing too is that, and, and this is one of the things I notice whenever I've attended a live coding performance is much more so than maybe other kind of pro performances. There is this kind of, in fact, I, I mentioned this to Mike when I was talking to Mike Nik about this as well. One of the things I notice in live coding performances is that it's ubiquitous that people project their coding while they're playing, right? Yeah. But in a way that kind of, that kind of takes it back to this sort of like, the important thing is happening at the front of the room. Yeah. And, and sometimes that can be distracting, and sometimes it can, I think it also, I, I was gonna say it demystifies the music, but it doesn't, because the coding oftentimes is plenty mystical, but it gives you a grounding of what's going on and where it's coming from, the fact that you're not playing iTunes. But the flip side of it is that it, it really does, it locks you into what's on the screen versus what the performer's doing, or what the person next to you is doing, or which person across the room is doing. You know, it's a, it's a ch it <span style="color:red" data-ts="913.465" data-end_ts="913.685" title="913.465" id=c_"913.465">__ch__</span> it really shifts your attention in a, in a, in a particular way, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alex: </b>Yeah. And it's a bit, I mean, if you're performing and you look up and people are just staring up at the screen, <laugh>, you don't get any feedback from that and Right. I don't know it, yeah. I've always felt ambivalent about this. So I guess at first started projected my screen in the year two thousands, and I've always been troubled by this, thing. Like, I, I started off playing as part of a band called Celeb, and we still performed sometimes. And we discussed this a lot. We wanted to share what we were doing. Right, right. And at the time, the idea of a programmer actually being creative was quite an alien concept at all. So it was quite important for us to show ourselves programming. But, the same time, we didn't want people to just read the code and make it feel like it was some kind of, I don't know, seminar or the music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alex: </b>The sound was the most important thing. So we used to do things like project on top of each other so that you could see what we were doing, but not really read it and sort of obscure it in different ways. But then <span style="color:red" data-ts="981.365" data-end_ts="981.565" title="981.365" id=c_"981.365">__that__</span> a few years ago, this guy Annie came to a performance <span style="color:red" data-ts="986.205" data-end_ts="986.405" title="986.205" id=c_"986.205">__out__</span> in London, a two hour performance, I remember that was quite an ordeal. <span style="color:red" data-ts="991.695" data-end_ts="992.045" title="991.695" id=c_"991.695">__Twice__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="992.045" data-end_ts="992.285" title="992.045" id=c_"992.045">__hour__</span> performed two hours. <span style="color:red" data-ts="993.005" data-end_ts="993.245" title="993.005" id=c_"993.005">__Right__</span>. But, yeah, he came along, and he's profoundly deaf, but also a musician, so he was using Fruity Loops and things. And he is also a programmer, so he was reading the code, and he, he said afterwards that by reading the code, he could actually access the music more. He could understand it more. Oh, sure, sure. Halfway through the performance I'd turned a strobe on. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alex: </b>And yeah, he said that then you couldn't read the code and it wasn't so, so yeah, from then on I, I've been, yeah, I've realized that, yeah, some people get quite a lot from reading the code. Right, right. And before that, I, I sort of wondered whether there's sort of cognitive contention between reading code and listening to music. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1033.385" data-end_ts="1033.605" title="1033.385" id=c_"1033.385">__And__</span> I still think there might well be, and when I watch Performance Live <span style="color:red" data-ts="1037.205" data-end_ts="1037.445" title="1037.205" id=c_"1037.205">__Code__</span> Informance, I never very rarely read the code. I'd much rather sort of tune out, maybe get a sense from seeing how the code is building up and going with the buildup of the music, which can be nice. But, I don't attend to it myself. But yeah, since Andy's experience, I, I think it, it's sort of, important from accessibility standpoint to, to at least for me to project, and make it clear. So I use quite a big font now and things like that. <laugh>. Yeah. And Annie has since sort of picked up title himself and made a couple of albums with it and done quite a few performances and organized his own Gros. So it's great to have him as part of the community. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's really cool. So now your performance, you perform under the name Yasu, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alex: </b>Yeah. Yeah. So I've got quite a few collaborations as well. But yeah, that's, a word I came up with a while ago for my solo work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, so, and you've actually been performing pretty widely, and, and some of that is because of your work developing title cycles, right? Is it called Title? It's called Title Cycles. Right. I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1104.845" data-end_ts="1104.965" title="1104.845" id=c_"1104.845">__wanna__</span>, I, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alex: </b>I I'm take a 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sideline here. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alex: </b>Yeah, <laugh>. It's, it's been through a few different name changes. Okay. But it's sort of settled on tdo, but then at some point this, streaming service came along. So just to differentiate it, we added cycles, but yeah, for sure. It's tidal. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Got it. And, so, so when we talk about live coding, you're really, you're focused on using this, this tool that you developed. I, I am always curious about this and, and I should know better given, you know, what I do for a gig. But nevertheless, I'll say, I'll say this. How difficult is it for you to be making music on the same tool that you developed? Do you ever, does it ever feel like, well, there's no magic here because I wrote every line of it, or I wrote many of the lines of it? Or do you feel, or when you're performing, are you able to go past that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alex: </b>Yes. Never been something that's been a negative point. I think it's always been positive. I, I guess <span style="color:red" data-ts="1173.605" data-end_ts="1173.725" title="1173.605" id=c_"1173.605">__I__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1173.725" data-end_ts="1173.925" title="1173.725" id=c_"1173.725">__see__</span> as slightly different activities making title and then using it, but they sort of support each other. So I might have ideas during a performance, which feeds into the development, but more importantly, the other way. So I guess I, when I'm not enjoying using title is when I feel like I know it really well when I sort of have certain set pieces I do and no new ideas are coming. And that's when that really spurs me on to add a new function or something. 'cause that sort of freshens up everything else. And sort of the ideal, situation I've found for a performance is when I've just <span style="color:red" data-ts="1210.765" data-end_ts="1211.005" title="1210.765" id=c_"1210.765">__studied__</span> something new and I'm still learning what it is, and how to use it. And then it's just so nice to be learning during a performance and sort of getting these new things back from it all the time. It's just really inspiring. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1225.545" data-end_ts="1225.765" title="1225.545" id=c_"1225.545">__See__</span>, I've never thought of it as being a, have, have you thought heard of other people who find this is a problem or 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sometimes, yeah. Just because, and, and it's kind of based on what you just said, which is almost that by doing thing, by, by creating the thing, it loses some of the ability to maybe surprise you. And so you end up falling into creative ruts because Yeah. It's either a part of the program, you know, is unlikely to crash in performance, so you, it becomes a crutch. Yeah. Or stuff like that. Right. And so I think that that, that those kinds of things, sometimes have, have limited people's enjoyment of using their own work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alex: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1271.435" data-end_ts="1271.725" title="1271.435" id=c_"1271.435">__Yeah__</span>. That's a bit, a bit sad really, isn't it? <laugh>? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I, I would say, I would say so, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alex: </b>Yeah. To put so much work into something and then find that other people who actually benefit from it, I mean, yeah. I mean, it's nice that other people do benefit from T <span style="color:red" data-ts="1287.205" data-end_ts="1287.405" title="1287.205" id=c_"1287.205">__Door__</span>, but, yeah, from the start with Celeb, we made a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1291.725" data-end_ts="1291.965" title="1291.725" id=c_"1291.725">__submit__</span> little manifesto called the Generative Manifesto, and we sort of declared that we'd only ever use our own software. And sort of Uhhuh kind of stuck to that really. And I've never thought it was a bad thing. I think something to do with Pattern as well is that, you really only when you're making the language, you're just making possibilities for live coding with it. And, and then when it comes to performance, you're sort of making the software for the performance live in front of everyone. So I guess it is a different situation to making something like a interface where, I don't know, I dunno, maybe it's, I have to talk to other people about this. Right. Interesting. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So now you've, let's talk about title a little bit and about some of the details behind it. First of all, it's written in, it's written in Haskell. Why Haskell? I mean, in my experience, until I started, until I actually went to a, to a workshop and, and learned, some title and kind of fell in love with it, frankly. Until then, the only thing I knew about Haskell is that pointy headed academic <span style="color:red" data-ts="1366.195" data-end_ts="1366.685" title="1366.195" id=c_"1366.195">__science__</span>, computer science people used it. Right. <laugh>? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alex: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Why, why Haskell? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alex: </b>Well, I guess at the time, I found myself with a lot of time on my hands. 'cause I was going start, I was doing, a part-time Masters, and eventually going into doing a PhD at Goldsmiths in London. Okay. And I was in a sort of computing department. I mean, in Goldsmiths it's really, I mean, it's surrounded by musicians and psychologists is <span style="color:red" data-ts="1395.405" data-end_ts="1395.565" title="1395.405" id=c_"1395.405">__really__</span> interdisciplinary, but still, I was in computing and I guess I wanted to pick up a language where I'd be taken seriously by my peers, <laugh>. Right. So I guess that's one reason. I mean, the other was that I was working a lot in a language called Pearl at the time. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. That was how I was live coding up <span style="color:red" data-ts="1414.645" data-end_ts="1414.845" title="1414.645" id=c_"1414.645">__till__</span> about 2005 or something like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You were live coding in Pearl? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alex: </b>Yeah. Holy crap. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So that's like, that's like live coding in Hieroglyphics, man. Yeah. <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alex: </b>Yeah. I made my own system sort of editor in Pearl that I could write Pearl that could edit in itself in order to give feedback on what process was happening. Oh my God. But that was, yeah, that, that's kind of the life coding approach at the time, was that you'd start programming <span style="color:red" data-ts="1445.645" data-end_ts="1445.805" title="1445.645" id=c_"1445.645">__and__</span> about five minutes later the first sound would come out, which wasn't really good enough for, what I wanted to do was, which was improvise with percussionists, my friend Alex, gag. Okay. So, and that drove me to find a different language and yeah. Start making something more domain specific and yeah, so Haskell was well known in the Pearl community at the time, as well as like Pearl six was being developed in Haskell at the time. It just seemed to be a nice, interesting language to learn. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alex: </b>Sure. So I guess it's just this mess of reasons really. But the reason I stuck with it is it just fits really well with pattern making because the whole thing around currying where you can just take a function, just give it some, of its parameters to get a new function that takes the rest that you can then pass to other functions. You end up these ways of passing around pattern transformations, which are very natural in a way. You, you don't have to add a lot of extra code around it. You just throw these functions between patterns. And also the very strong type system around it just force me to think very, very long and hard about the core representation, what a pattern is, which, and the answer eventually was a function from one time span to events happening during that time span. So you end up with functions of functions everywhere, but, basically you just described pattern in terms of behavior. I suppose That's a nice way of putting it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, my, my sense of it too was that there was different languages or different environments have a different concept. You know, whether you think of like Unix piping or, or JavaScripts functional programming concepts or whatever. This, this idea of developing, developing kind of a tooling that is, is really flexible and is really sort of like easy to use in <span style="color:red" data-ts="1568.805" data-end_ts="1568.845" title="1568.805" id=c_"1568.805">__a__</span> ad hoc way. I mean, conceptually that makes a lot of sense also for a live coding environment. And it seems like that's what, that's how title feels to me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alex: </b>That's interesting. I mean, I, I guess it's a title is, it's not something I've really designed. It's just something I've stared at for a long time and molded <laugh> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1587.635" data-end_ts="1587.925" title="1587.635" id=c_"1587.635">__much__</span>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1587.925" data-end_ts="1588.125" title="1587.925" id=c_"1587.925">__And__</span> I guess it comes to what I was talking about earlier about, ideas not coming from, the world of ideas that you project into the world, but rather through interaction with material. And that's certainly how titles develop. So it's not something I fully understand. It's just something which I've, I've made <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, that's, that's a really powerful concept though. And, and that's something that I, I have to remember to take out of this because it does seem like our society sort of like celebrates the idea of the person who, you know, they celebrate Elon Musk. Right. Because he came up with a great idea and then put everybody <span style="color:red" data-ts="1626.865" data-end_ts="1627.085" title="1626.865" id=c_"1626.865">__on__</span> to making it right. Yeah. And the idea of, instead I think of someone like a woodworker, right. Who puts a block of wood on a lathe and starts carving it and all of a sudden finds that, you know, the, the right table leg comes out of it because of the nature of the wood and the nature <span style="color:red" data-ts="1643.555" data-end_ts="1643.845" title="1643.555" id=c_"1643.555">__Yeah__</span>. Tools and all that kind of stuff. Right. I mean, it seems like that's the kind of thing you're talking about. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alex: </b>Yeah. That's a metaphor that Tim Ingold uses. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alex: </b>He's a philosopher, I suppose, but, anthropologist. And he talks about soaring through wood as being something where you're not imposing a line on the wood, but rather working as a flow of force through the flow of force of the wood, which is <span style="color:red" data-ts="1668.845" data-end_ts="1669.045" title="1668.845" id=c_"1668.845">__what__</span> to do with the grain and everything. And, and you really have to sort of interact with the wood rather than impose an idea on it. And, and if you actually want to end up with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1678.365" data-end_ts="1678.485" title="1678.365" id=c_"1678.365">__a__</span>, with a piece of furniture at the end. Right. I think it's, it's nice to think of these things coming out of a community of practice as well. Yeah. Yeah. Sort of when, when I do workshops with people, the kind of questions I get are really open up the way I think about title. 'cause as I said, I don't fully understand. It's when people ask questions or say what they think it is, it's just so, insightful and rewarding. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alex: </b>And it's nice that you interviewed Mike already 'cause I guess he was sort of the first person using title. Well, not exactly the first, but I mean, he, he put so much work into getting it to work and then exploring it as part of his own practice. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And it just reminds me of this, Ted talk I saw a while ago. I can't remember who <span style="color:red" data-ts="1723.725" data-end_ts="1723.925" title="1723.725" id=c_"1723.725">__by__</span>, but it just shows this guy a music festival in the middle of a field quite far away from the stage, dancing, like a complete nutcase <laugh> and just, someone's obviously videoing him 'cause he is just going crazy. But then this other guy just runs up and starts joining in. And the first guy welcomes him, and then they both sort of do crazy moves. And then <span style="color:red" data-ts="1745.365" data-end_ts="1745.485" title="1745.365" id=c_"1745.365">__a__</span> third person joins and then eventually hundreds of people are running. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alex: </b>So some of them, I guess, don't really know why they're doing it. And just dancing completely crazy in the middle of this field, far away from this stage. And it's just nice to think about how important that second person is. And also the third person. It's not just the crazy person who <laugh>, who's trying out something crazy, but the person who turns it into a happening is, is actually the second person and then the third, you know? <span style="color:red" data-ts="1771.965" data-end_ts="1772.205" title="1771.965" id=c_"1771.965">__Right__</span>. But somehow the first person gets all the credit. But <laugh>, yeah, if it was just them that'd like a CRA then yeah, nothing would happen really. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's hilarious. So, boy, I, I could go in these directions all day, but I wanna make sure that I get a chance to ask you. One of the things I like doing in my podcast is talking to people about their backgrounds and how they got to be the, the artists or builders that they are. And when you have, when you're coming to the table with such a unique combination of skills and interests and practices, I am really curious what your background is. How did you get started on the musical side? How did you get started on the, technical side where, where, you know, it, it sounds like you definitely have some computer science bones. Where did that interest come in? What is, what is your background that brought all of these things together? Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alex: </b>It does come from computer programming for me, which I think is quite rare in live coding. I think it's mostly musicians who wanted to expand their practice by getting into coding. But for me it's definitely the other way around. And I don't really think of programming and music making <span style="color:red" data-ts="1850.825" data-end_ts="1851.045" title="1850.825" id=c_"1850.825">__as__</span> separate. So I guess I've come from definitely that background sort of making from a, very self-driven, wanting to make, bulletin boards on the, early internet and things like that and, create communities. But I suppose what really got me into music was, being in London around the air 2000 when they were just these couple of really nice spaces where you could just do whatever you wanted. And my friend Adrian, really encouraging me to get into generative music, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1883.425" data-end_ts="1883.645" title="1883.425" id=c_"1883.425">__who__</span> was me and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1884.165" data-end_ts="1884.325" title="1884.165" id=c_"1884.165">__aid__</span> who started eb. So there's this <span style="color:red" data-ts="1886.325" data-end_ts="1886.525" title="1886.325" id=c_"1886.325">__paper__</span> called The Foundry where the KLF were involved and, and you could just do whatever you wanted <span style="color:red" data-ts="1891.225" data-end_ts="1891.445" title="1891.225" id=c_"1891.225">__you__</span>, and there was something on the wall saying this, as long as you weren't offended by the Arts Council, they'd let you just do whatever you want, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alex: </b>So we started to do events there, first of all, aids generative music. And yeah, then I started joining him doing this sort of thing. And another place called Public Life, which was a converted, what used to be a squatted toilet. And the guy's Theor <span style="color:red" data-ts="1913.845" data-end_ts="1914.005" title="1913.845" id=c_"1913.845">__garage__</span> turned it into this really small venue, underground. So like one of these underground toilets you'd get in London. Okay. And I mentioned these, 'cause I think it's really important to have these spaces for experimentation where you are not quite sure what you are, what you want to do, but, just freeform to do what you want, with no pressure, you don't have to pay, you just do it. But yeah, so I guess from there I got into software art. So that was something around the, turn of the millennia where for a while people were, the idea of software being <span style="color:red" data-ts="1947.725" data-end_ts="1947.925" title="1947.725" id=c_"1947.725">__out__</span> was quite new again. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alex: </b>I guess the earlier phases with something, it was called computer art originally, but then there was a, a few years where software art was a thing and I was sort of part of that and won an award at the Transmedial Festival for, it was a pearl script, actually a 10 line pearl script <laugh>. Oh wow. That, just crushed your computer and made a nice pattern while it did it <laugh> it's a fork <span style="color:red" data-ts="1971.525" data-end_ts="1971.765" title="1971.525" id=c_"1971.525">__bomb__</span>. So, but yeah, I just always really enjoyed creating spaces and creating communities. So got involved in something called Dork Bot and the placard headphone festivals. Then around the year 2004, I think it was, I was invited to this event in Hamburg called, changing Grammars, organized by <span style="color:red" data-ts="1996.425" data-end_ts="1996.845" title="1996.425" id=c_"1996.425">__Ronald__</span> Weiser and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1998.325" data-end_ts="1998.525" title="1998.325" id=c_"1998.325">__Ian__</span> Uba, and that's where Top <span style="color:red" data-ts="2000.325" data-end_ts="2000.525" title="2000.325" id=c_"2000.325">__PLA__</span> was formed. This was a, a little event about life coding, sort of first one, and there were probably about 20 people there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alex: </b>And it really felt like there was something really magical in the air around then sort of lots of people suddenly using programming languages for, for live music, or at least live exploration of music. And so yeah, top <span style="color:red" data-ts="2021.065" data-end_ts="2021.285" title="2021.065" id=c_"2021.065">__pla__</span> the temporary organization for the programming of live algorithm programming was called, it was, formed. And, I got quite involved in that as a sort of helping run the website and coordinate it, or, I don't <span style="color:red" data-ts="2034.805" data-end_ts="2034.885" title="2034.805" id=c_"2034.805">__know__</span>, I guess I'm just picking out a few moments in history where, in my personal history where I felt like important things have happened. And I guess it's all been around finding a space in between things sort of where new things have, it felt like something new could happen, sort of, you kind of have a feeling that there's something interesting here, but you dunno what it is. And I suppose that's what I've been driven by this feeling of possibility and, and risk and, embracing failure by doing these sort of experimental events where things often go wrong, but in interesting ways where you sort of learn what you're doing on, on the fly, I suppose. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, but one of, one of the things I would say is that it seems like a lot of your, I'll just call it forward movement is related to community. Whether it's, it's meeting these people that open your eyes to programming languages as a artistic tool or it's, you know, developing a language in a specific way because you wanted to collaborate with a percussionist or whatever. It seems like you are more interested in, and and this goes back to what you said about this idea of growing things by working in the world. It seems like you are very much driven to, or are influenced by people and interaction with people rather than this being a solitary, you know, a lot of, a lot of tooling and a lot of computer music tools are sort of like a guy in an academic basement grinding away on a machine, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you seem to have taken a very different approach than that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alex: </b>Yeah. I, I guess that's fundamentally what programming is, isn't it? It's sort of quite a lonely occupation, but still a fascinating one. Yeah. It's sort of this strange world of puzzles and ideas. Right. And I guess it's fundamentally socially in a way because you're working in this operating system, which has been made by thousands of other people. I mean, I use Linux and it feels like, if I think about Linux, I think about this sort of community of practice in itself, really based around, strange license that allows us to work together. When you're actually coding something, it's generally on your own unless you are, doing pair programming or something. But I've never really gone with that. So I've been compelled to program as, as my way of making things, but it does feel very lonely. And, and so I guess, yeah, I'm driven by this need to actually share things with people as a fairly introverted, computer hacker <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>How many, how many other people are involved in the code base or the coding of title? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alex: </b>Ooh, actively, I'd say four or five maybe. In a way it's quite, it, it still feels early days as a, as a free software project because there's, there's not an easy way in, it's something we need to work on over the next year, I think is actually documenting things so it's easier to hack on. Right. Haskell's not the easiest language to learn for, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2222.625" data-end_ts="2222.845" title="2222.625" id=c_"2222.625">__so__</span> who's been brought up with a different paradigm like I was as well. Sure. But yeah, it's definitely something I want to open up at this point, but I think that isn't necessarily an ideal. I wanna force on other people and it's not something I had, I think for life coding systems, I think I can see with other people. It's nice. And for myself as well, for the first few years of development, it's nice for it to be just one person's work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alex: </b>Right. Because you are, you're sort of working through these ideas and, not quite sure where they're going. And it's, it can be quite, disturbing to, I, I guess it's nice just to work on your own ideas alone. But at some point you feel like you've explored them and it's time to share them. And it feels like there was a natural time when people like Mike got involved when it was time to become a free software project. So yeah, I've, I've always shared the code of title, but actually going from being open source to being a free software project, I think is a whole other thing. And I think we're still going through that process now, but, . Yeah. Getting there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Now, one of the things that I noticed when I took the workshop is that, a significant part of, the title environment is actually something completely outside the title environment, which is the, the dirt or super dirt, sampling system, which is, super Dirt, which is what we used in our workshop was, is a thing, that runs inside a super collider and then, tidal kind of interacts with it. So it's, it, first of all, it's kind of interesting because it means that it's kind of sample driven in an interesting way. But, secondly that is like a completely different open source movement effort that you're able to sort of like leverage. So even though there might be only a few people working on Tidal, there's also this other group working on the sampling engine and that ends up also helping the growth of tid. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alex: </b>Yeah. Yeah. So, originally I used Title With Dirt, which is based on something my friend a wrote wrote Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But then Ian, who, who co-organized that first live coding system I mentioned, just rewrote it in super lyder one day, and made it a whole lot better because yeah, super <span style="color:red" data-ts="2369.005" data-end_ts="2369.085" title="2369.005" id=c_"2369.005">__GL__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2369.085" data-end_ts="2369.285" title="2369.085" id=c_"2369.085">__is__</span> amazing system. Yeah. But yeah, it integrates samples with synths in a really nice way, actually. So you can live Code Syns in Super Collider while triggering them with Ty <span style="color:red" data-ts="2379.025" data-end_ts="2379.245" title="2379.025" id=c_"2379.025">__or__</span> I, I still mostly use, samples myself, but, other people are much more into synths. Yeah. That's really nice. I haven't, I have done some things in Super Collider, but I haven't had any hand in creating Super <span style="color:red" data-ts="2391.595" data-end_ts="2391.885" title="2391.595" id=c_"2391.595">__Dirt__</span>. And it, it's a, it is its own project <span style="color:red" data-ts="2394.995" data-end_ts="2395.285" title="2394.995" id=c_"2394.995">__that__</span> integrates nicely with T <span style="color:red" data-ts="2396.605" data-end_ts="2396.765" title="2396.605" id=c_"2396.605">__Door__</span> of course 'cause that's what it was made for, but you can use it with anything else. I think Renick <span style="color:red" data-ts="2400.905" data-end_ts="2401.125" title="2400.905" id=c_"2400.905">__BA__</span> is based in Tokyo, uses it with his system, conductive. So it's sort of decoupled from Tidal in that way. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>
</p>

<p>
<b>Alex: </b>Yeah, it's nice. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's, it's kind of an interesting, sampler too, because unlike most of them, rather than focusing on, there's not a lot of orientation about focusing on making the samplers own format rather than, rather it's sort of like, you know, let's have this great big folder of sounds and then we're gonna let the sampler interrogate the folder. And I just felt, when I was playing with it, I was really entranced by how it worked because I was so used to samplers being these kind of monolithic things where you have to put together key groups and velocity overlays and Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, you end up <span style="color:red" data-ts="2450.485" data-end_ts="2450.725" title="2450.485" id=c_"2450.485">__spent__</span> having to spend a lot of time with the sampler engine just to make something detailed and good. Where what I found with Super Dirt was instead it like, you have this great big pile of samples and you're development of a complex, like voicing or whatever is something that you can do on the fly with your coding outside of the sampler. And it somehow just felt really creative to me in <span style="color:red" data-ts="2478.045" data-end_ts="2478.165" title="2478.045" id=c_"2478.045">__a__</span>, in a way that I'd not experienced with samplers before. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alex: </b>That's nice. Yeah. Yeah, I haven't really used anything else apart from dirt and Super Dirt. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2486.785" data-end_ts="2487.005" title="2486.785" id=c_"2486.785">__Oh__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alex: </b>Lucky you. <laugh>, <laugh> 17 years, so I'm kind of, can't really compare it with anything else, but, yeah, it is sort of made for life coding, of course. So. Right. Yeah. Just, and the default samples you get with Super <span style="color:red" data-ts="2500.605" data-end_ts="2500.845" title="2500.605" id=c_"2500.605">__Dirt__</span>, most of them are just the samples I have lying around on my hard drive, 10 years ago or something. So it's quite a, a mess of stuff, but people have said that it's nice to have that starting point. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, I think it was really, it was really key to the success of the workshop. I went to that, you know, when you type in, you know, BD and you start typing in some rhythms, there's an 8 0 8 kick. Right. It's not like some crummy sound from, you know, default sound from your operating system, but it's actually something that in the end you wanted to hear in the first place. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alex: </b>Yeah. And, and because, super dirt's, so good at, well, you can cut up the samples into, into grains and Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and rearrange them very quickly with TS patterns, and you kind of get away from the source material quite quickly, I think. . If you want to, if you choose pile on the effects. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, in a way it's sort of a starting point rather than the atoms of, of what you're making. It depends on how your approach, of course. But, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So we're, man, we're already getting, getting to the end of our time, but before we go, I want to ask you a little bit about something. Unfortunately, we just missed out on being able to talk about the preparation for this, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2584.905" data-end_ts="2585.125" title="2584.905" id=c_"2584.905">__but__</span> we can talk maybe about the aftermath or just the development of the, the Algo <span style="color:red" data-ts="2591.345" data-end_ts="2591.565" title="2591.345" id=c_"2591.345">__me__</span>, festival that you put together. It's been going for a couple years, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alex: </b>Yeah, yeah. We started last year and just the last one in November. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, yeah. Right. Yeah, about a, a little over a month ago. It was a pretty, pretty complex thing. You had, performers, you had workshops, you had installations, you had a lot of stuff going. Did you do this from scratch and, and did you have work with a lot of other people or was it primarily your thing to get it going? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alex: </b>Well, the first year I worked with some friends of mine, John Janet from Love <span style="color:red" data-ts="2629.145" data-end_ts="2629.365" title="2629.145" id=c_"2629.145">__Bys__</span>, which is a festival that, I think they did 19 festivals in Sheffield. Mm-Hmm. They don't do that anymore, but, it was really great to have them involved. The first year they couldn't, they couldn't get involved with the second year for various reasons, but, so the second year was mostly me. But, yeah, the genesis was, collaboration. I kind of pulled together things in the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2653.495" data-end_ts="2654.165" title="2653.495" id=c_"2653.495">__curatorial__</span> side, I guess, both years. So you're sort of pulling together lots of ideas I've had around, the opening <span style="color:red" data-ts="2661.625" data-end_ts="2661.845" title="2661.625" id=c_"2661.625">__up__</span> of systems, whether they're algorithmic or mechanical. And yeah, just, over a year sort of dreaming up this event, which the theme this year was unmaking, so Uhhuh <affirmative>, trying to focus on ways of taking things apart in order to open up connecting with the Penelope project again. Sure. See <span style="color:red" data-ts="2683.045" data-end_ts="2683.245" title="2683.045" id=c_"2683.045">__here__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>How now you, there was a lot of, of supporters of this, you know, when I go to the website, it's, you know, you had a lot of community support, you had a lot of broad support. How does, how difficult is it to pull that part of it together? You know, there's, there's the idea of like, well, I have to go find artists, but a lot of times artists wanna perform or show their work. So if you, if you give them a reason to be excited about something, they'll, they'll do so. Right. But getting sponsors and getting locations and getting your community to back it, sometimes that's a lot harder than interacting with the artists. How, how did that come together for you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alex: </b>Interesting. Well, I guess the venue, came to me. So, millennium Gallery, interesting first year, came to me saying they wanted to host an out <span style="color:red" data-ts="2737.285" data-end_ts="2737.525" title="2737.285" id=c_"2737.285">__grave__</span>. And it's really great to find individuals in organizations who just want to make something that happen uhhuh. And that's their main motivation. Interesting. When you can find these people, it's, they're just gold. So, right. Working with, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2751.695" data-end_ts="2752.045" title="2751.695" id=c_"2751.695">__Rosen__</span> Laura there was great, in the UK we have most of the arts funding comes from the Arts Council, so through a application process, we were able to get a grant for the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2762.485" data-end_ts="2762.645" title="2762.485" id=c_"2762.485">__art__</span> with grants for the arts, which was, really great. And another one is, performing rights, foundation Performing Rights Society Foundation, who funded, six five days of statics performance. So, mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, most of the money came from there, with some support from other organizations. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alex: </b>Yeah. I, I guess it's just, knowing enough people who just want to make things happen and then, then, things just happen. It's, it's, I guess it's the addiction really. I mean, at the end of the festival, you never want to do it again, but <laugh> just, just the thought of having this idea and wanting to see what it would be like. The only way you can find out is by doing it. So <laugh> then, then that comes the problem of what to do the next time. Because, a few times I've done these strange events and they've been really amazing, and then I've repeated them the second year and it's felt like going through the motions because there's no risk, there's no excitement, you know? Oh, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2817.965" data-end_ts="2818.125" title="2817.965" id=c_"2817.965">__yeah__</span>. Right. More or less it's gonna be a success and that, that kind of makes <span style="color:red" data-ts="2821.205" data-end_ts="2821.325" title="2821.205" id=c_"2821.205">__it__</span> a bit boring. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alex: </b>So next year we want to do it, differently to keep, keep it, keep us on our, our toes, and I'm going to have a bigger team again, so make it more of a collaboration because it's just too much this year, <laugh>. Sure. So yeah, the next year we want to do it in May, actually it's gonna be 2019, May, 2019. Okay. And, and focus on rituals. So that's a really nice time of year where there's all these strange things where people, in the uk, I dunno if you have this in the us, but <span style="color:red" data-ts="2849.385" data-end_ts="2849.605" title="2849.385" id=c_"2849.385">__may__</span> poles where we just erect this big pole and attach ribbons, and then children dance <span style="color:red" data-ts="2855.465" data-end_ts="2855.685" title="2855.465" id=c_"2855.465">__the__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2855.705" data-end_ts="2855.925" title="2855.705" id=c_"2855.705">__now__</span> to each other to make this braid on the pole. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. See, that's, that's literally too nice and too communal for it to happen in the us <laugh>, it's not enough independence of Spirit in what you just said, Fred, to work here. Sorry. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alex: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2871.505" data-end_ts="2871.725" title="2871.505" id=c_"2871.505">__Oh__</span>, <laugh>. I'm sure there's someone doing it somewhere, but <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alex: </b>I know, I dunno. People just make, like, I heard about this, I can't remember what it's called, but in, in Ireland, children do this thing where they take bits of grass and, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2886.025" data-end_ts="2886.245" title="2886.025" id=c_"2886.025">__and__</span> make these strange, spirals out of them. Mm-Hmm. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2889.785" data-end_ts="2890.005" title="2889.785" id=c_"2889.785">__And__</span> I think that's nice about just making these patterns in the spring. And it connects nicely to algorithmic music, of course, which I think is all about pattern and, and, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2899.675" data-end_ts="2899.965" title="2899.675" id=c_"2899.675">__yeah__</span>, we want to do this male <span style="color:red" data-ts="2900.845" data-end_ts="2901.045" title="2900.845" id=c_"2900.845">__pole__</span>, but have children going in one direction and robots going in the other. So Nice. I'm not quite sure how we're going to do that, but, that's the plan. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, Alex, this was a fantastic chat. I, I wish I had two more hours because I have tons more that I'd love to ask you, but unfortunately, our, our time is, is up. I wanna thank you again for taking the time outta your schedule. You're a really busy guy and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2924.925" data-end_ts="2925.165" title="2924.925" id=c_"2924.925">__Simon__</span>, appreciate the fact that you gave me a little bit of your day in order to, to run through this stuff. Thank you so much. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alex: </b>Oh, thanks so much. And thanks for all the questions. It's been really nice. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh yeah, it was a lot of fun. Thanks. And with that, I will let you have the rest of your day. Catch you later. See ya. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alex: </b>Bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now. Wasn't that amazing? Alex is an incredible guy. He has his fingers in just about everything out there. It's really something else. So I want to thank you for, listening again this week, and thanks again to Chris Coleman and lale <span style="color:red" data-ts="2964.645" data-end_ts="2964.805" title="2964.645" id=c_"2964.645">__me__</span> for their sport. Next week we start a new series, in conjunction with syn topia, dealing with the open source world of both hardware and software. We have some really interesting participants in that. I also want to just cue you, clue you into a little something. I've posted up a, a release on Bandcamp. It's the means of production a, composition and performance that I did back in 2010. If you are so inclined, jump over to Darwin gross.bandcamp.com. Darwin grosses, D-A-R-W-I-N-G-R-O-S-S-E, and, take a listen. It's free to listen. It's two bucks if you wanna support me a little bit. But just listen, I think it's a fun little piece and, it's a lot of modular and a little bit of digital processing and a whole lot of performance. So I hope you enjoy it. Thanks again for listening. We'll catch you next week. Bye.
