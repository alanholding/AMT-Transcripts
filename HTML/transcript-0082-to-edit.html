<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, today's, discussion is with Jesse Sola who goes by the name Mina. Throughout the discussion, we talk about his music. If you want to check some of it out ahead of time, you can look@newmanandmusic.com, which is his primary website. He also has a Bandcamp site. It is mina.bandcamp.com. That's n U M I N a.bandcamp.com. If you have a chance, please check out some of that stuff <span style="color:red" data-ts="37.97" data-end_ts="38.19" title="37.97" id=c_"37.97">__as__</span> we talk about music and music making gear and music making sounds and sound design a lot throughout. So I'll let you have at it. There you go. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today I have, a special opportunity to introduce you to a person that I've gotten to know, a bit over the years. We actually started communicating a lot because he runs house concerts and, Robert Rich on his recent tour did a house concert at his house. The guy's name is Jesse <span style="color:red" data-ts="72.02" data-end_ts="72.31" title="72.02" id=c_"72.02">__Solo__</span>, but he goes <span style="color:red" data-ts="72.79" data-end_ts="72.99" title="72.79" id=c_"72.79">__under__</span> the artist's name of Mina, and it is some fabulous work. I've gotten a chance to spend a little time with his latest release called Through the Gate to Nowhere, and, it's a stunning piece of work. It's kind of a dark, ambient thing, and it's just beautiful. <span style="color:red" data-ts="90.94" data-end_ts="91.23" title="90.94" id=c_"90.94">__Well__</span>, the whole thing is just amazing. So <span style="color:red" data-ts="93.3" data-end_ts="93.59" title="93.3" id=c_"93.3">__tell__</span> <laugh> explaining how much I love it. But with that, I want to introduce, Jesse Sola Jesse, how are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse Sola: </b>Well, hi. Nice. I'm doing great. And, and thanks for putting us together and after that introduction, we, we could probably just stop there, <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="108.94" data-end_ts="109.23" title="108.94" id=c_"108.94">__Good__</span> enough. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>Right, right. No, but, but yeah, thanks for having me and be happy to hear to answer some questions and I look forward to it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That's great. So, a couple of things. First of all, why don't you fill, fill the readers in on, the things that you do artistically, the releases, when you do performances, if you do other kind of sound work? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>Sure, sure. Well, I guess, as you mentioned, I'm, I mean, I'm mostly known for my dark ambient project, Mina, and I've been doing that now since, oh, probably around 97. I I never really remember the start year of, of my project, 'cause I, I've always been sort of tinkering with synthesizers for, since I was a child, literally. But, between that and some of sound design work, those are the, the two, two things I guess I'm known for. What got me into synthesizers was not only just, I loved the sound of a synthesizer, I loved the tactile touch of a synthesizer and working with him. But my father was a musician and, and he was a keyboardist, and he used to bring his mini mug home after his gigs and set it up right in front of me. And I used to put on my Star Trek pajamas and Giant 1970s headphones, and then I just started tweaking away. So I've been kind of working with, with synthesizers ever, ever since. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's hilarious. Do you have any like, pictures? Did your mom like, take pictures of you with the headphones in the MiniMogue? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="201.74" data-end_ts="201.96" title="201.74" id=c_"201.74">__Nah__</span>, I, I sure wish. I mean, they're, you know, my, my parents were hippies and, and there's photo albums, but unfortunately none of me playing the MiniMogue, I, I sure wish there was, but yeah, that's a fond memory, at least. My, my father passed away when I was in high school, but to this day, I have that MiniMogue still here in the studio. It's been with me since 1976. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, that's amazing. But, so yeah, so with that as a start, where did you, how did you end up taking it on as your own thing, as your own art? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>Sure. So, I, I always was gra I just was always gravitated towards synthesizer based music. I mean, I liked a lot of different music, but I grew up as a child of the eighties, and I loved eighties synth pop. And I found that, you know, I I gravitated towards maybe the more moodier artist of, of the eighties too. And so, you know, even though I never really played or created my own music in that era, I just always liked <span style="color:red" data-ts="261.21" data-end_ts="261.56" title="261.21" id=c_"261.21">__synth__</span> type music. And, it wasn't until I was in college and I, I had had a, I had the Mogue and I had also a <span style="color:red" data-ts="270.75" data-end_ts="271.04" title="270.75" id=c_"270.75">__Juno__</span> 1 0 6 and Anh 1 0 1, and I started on my own putting, kind of just playing stuff, you know, just, just kind of programming and making sounds. And, and then I got myself a tape deck and I found myself a, a Chief Eliss quadri verb. And before you know it, I'm, I'm multi-tracking on a left and right channel <span style="color:red" data-ts="288.74" data-end_ts="288.96" title="288.74" id=c_"288.74">__two__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="288.96" data-end_ts="289.36" title="288.96" id=c_"288.96">__driving__</span> cassette deck, you know, so Right. So it kind of started out like that. And, and as time went on, I, after I got a real job with Real Money, I was able to kind of expand my studio and, and kind of go from there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>When you first started doing, doing stuff, were you trying to emulate like the synth pop genre, or did you, were you immediately trying to find your own musical voice? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>I started out, I kind of got influenced, into kind of doing the, the darker ambient music after hearing Hearts of Space and, and hearing Robert Rich and Steve Roach on there, and then became a really big fan of their work in the, the late nineties. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So it's interesting that, that one of the things that was influencing you was Hearts of Space. I can't tell you the number of people that that put a marker on that as being like a point where their artistic vision changed. An awful lot of electronic musicians found Heart Hearts of Space to be the mechanism that that turned them. So you mentioned Steve Roach and, and Robert Rich, who else might have been influences at that time? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>You know, those were like the two main guys, which is kind of funny. And at the same time, I started getting into the project label, the, the label that <span style="color:red" data-ts="365.26" data-end_ts="365.48" title="365.26" id=c_"365.26">__Sam__</span> Rosenthal runs. Right. And, you know, I kind of have a, a slightly to a slightly different path than I think a lot of people that are doing what I do. As far as ambient music, I grew up listening to, like, as I mentioned before, the, like the eighties and pop stuff. And I, and I really liked kind of like goth music and post-punk music and shoegaze music. I was really into music that really enveloped the headspace, and I was never really into anything experimental or anything too fluffy. But, but you're right. When I, when I hear other people talk about what got them into being an artist or fan of ambient music, it's always hearts of space. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>And I can remember distinctly back in the, late eighties when I was born in, I was born here in Denver, but I grew up in <span style="color:red" data-ts="412.72" data-end_ts="412.8" title="412.72" id=c_"412.72">__a__</span>, in Fargo, North Dakota of all places. But when we moved back here in the, in the mid eighties, the local public radio station would obviously broadcast towards <span style="color:red" data-ts="420.4" data-end_ts="420.56" title="420.4" id=c_"420.4">__the__</span> space and Right. Me and my parents would be out in the car at the store. We'd, we'd be <span style="color:red" data-ts="424.88" data-end_ts="425.08" title="424.88" id=c_"424.88">__pulling__</span> up in the driveway and we'd be like, whoa, what is this music? And we, we'd all, all three of us would sit in the car and we would, you know, wait until the end of the show to find out who, who was playing and stuff. So it, it was just a Headspace thing at that age. And, and I really connected with it, but I was still so young that I didn't process it in the sense that's what I want to do. You know, I just kind of listened to it as a, as a casual listener. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I think that that's kind of interesting though, because it's, it's a track not unlike mine. I didn't, I didn't come up through the ranks listening to, or or being super intrigued by experimental music until I kind of found myself in a position to do it. It was, but it was always sort of like the edgier side of pop. That was the thing that I, you know, especially when you're 18, that's the kind of stuff that you're gonna gravitate towards any anyway. I, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>I don't anti establishment. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I don't know that many 18 year olds that were, that were really into Brian Eno other than just to say it. Now. Maybe tastes have changed since then <laugh>, but Right. I mean, my first interaction with Brian Eno was him, him doing the Talking Heads albums, you know, that's, that's how I ran into him first. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>And it was Rock, worked <span style="color:red" data-ts="501.4" data-end_ts="501.52" title="501.4" id=c_"501.4">__with__</span> the Roxy music <span style="color:red" data-ts="502" data-end_ts="502.4" title="502" id=c_"502">__working__</span> that stuff, and even, and, and at my age, it was Eno's name popped up more with, with U two, you know, like <span style="color:red" data-ts="509.52" data-end_ts="509.72" title="509.52" id=c_"509.52">__Right__</span>. You know, his work with the, some of that stuff. And interestingly enough, I love Eno, but I didn't really know of his ambient work that well other than music for airports, you know, that might have popped up on <span style="color:red" data-ts="522.42" data-end_ts="522.84" title="522.42" id=c_"522.42">__Hearts__</span> of Space or stuff, something like that. But, it was, it was the Steve Roach Dreamtime Return Duff, you know, that, and, and the early Robert Rich, that, that just kind of caught me, even though they're very similar in style. There, there was something special about, about those two artists. And I guess I could sort of fall under, under that path, you know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But, yeah. Well, and, and it almost, it, it makes a sort of sense because the use of minor keys, the use of open space and stuff, there's actually a lot of overlap when you start taking Shoegaze <span style="color:red" data-ts="554.44" data-end_ts="554.6" title="554.44" id=c_"554.44">__or__</span> Rock and, some of these ambient things. There's actually, musically, there's actually a lot of crossroads there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>There is, yeah. For sure. It's just, obviously they don't use as many synthesizers, but, but the, but the vibe and the emotion is the same. And that's a great point. And, and one that people probably don't generally make the connection to there. There's a lot of people that are just like, guitar <span style="color:red" data-ts="575.74" data-end_ts="575.96" title="575.74" id=c_"575.74">__you__</span> guys only, or <laugh>, you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>Only, you know. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>Or if you, and you, you can't mix the two, it's wrong to mix the two. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>But for me, I guess growing up it was all about the Headspace. And, and when I was in college, you know, being exposed, I have to give a lot of credit to Sam Rosenthal because I think he, it was his label that brought the kind of ambient that I liked. 'cause I was into the kind of like the shoe gazi <span style="color:red" data-ts="598.92" data-end_ts="599.04" title="598.92" id=c_"598.92">__or__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="599.19" data-end_ts="599.48" title="599.19" id=c_"599.19">__goer__</span> side of his stuff. And then when, when Steve came on board, <span style="color:red" data-ts="602.88" data-end_ts="603" title="602.88" id=c_"602.88">__I__</span> was like, Hmm, who's this guy? And I'm like, whoa, this is, this is, this is it. You know, too. And I, I'd heard Steve prior to that, but, but, I think Project made it a little more accessible at the time. And, and then throughout college, you know, I was listening to a lot of Steve Roach and Robert Rich and <span style="color:red" data-ts="616.67" data-end_ts="616.96" title="616.67" id=c_"616.67">__Vida__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="617.27" data-end_ts="617.56" title="617.27" id=c_"617.27">__Vida__</span> Mana. And, and then some of Theier stuff like Slowdive and Right ly, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That was where there, the, the world of electronic ambient music was fracturing into a lot of directions. You know, there were the people that were taking things in a very new age direction. There were people that were taking it in this kind of dark and, and introspective direction. There were people that were basically making instrumental pop tunes, and it was kind of, it was kind of all over the map. What is it like about your personality that drew you to this darker set of releases and, and artists? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>I think some people get kind of scared of that music. <span style="color:red" data-ts="659.87" data-end_ts="660.16" title="659.87" id=c_"659.87">__They__</span>, it freaks 'em out. The music I do is, is somewhat dark, but it's also more sound tracky to me. It's more mm-hmm. <affirmative>. What I liked was not only just the headspace that music would put you in, but I also liked music that was like the soundtrack to your life, whether it be just driving through the mountains of Colorado or the deserts of Arizona or, or wherever. You know, that that music helped create the soundtrack that I liked, that fit the, the scenery for me. And in my world as far as it being dark, you know, I guess it's probably just a dark sense, you know? And it's not an evil thing. <span style="color:red" data-ts="696.2" data-end_ts="696.32" title="696.2" id=c_"696.2">__I__</span>, I don't like evil music, but <laugh>, it's right. You know, I mean, there's, there is evil music, you know, out there. But that's one of the things I kind of always sort of resented is sometimes people thought the darker edge to dark ambient music did not mean it was, you know. Right. You're into <span style="color:red" data-ts="711.78" data-end_ts="712" title="711.78" id=c_"711.78">__sa__</span> sat 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Satanism, right? Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Last night, one of, one of the things I was doing, I had to drive down to du to teach and, and back, and especially in the evening, I had it playing, and night was rolling in and a big thunderstorm kind of came washing through. And you talk about it being sort of like the soundtrack for your life. It seemed to be the perfect soundtrack for that moment, you know, it was, oh, great. Cool. And, and, you know, so it kind of implies a different kind of darkness. Yeah. It's not an evil darkness as much as just the world sometimes has a dark side to it. And, . It's an interesting, interesting way now in listening to the music, and I hope that people will take an opportunity to, I know you, you have a band camp site, right? I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>Do. Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So people can at least stream examples and stuff, from that. Absolutely. Yeah. I, I hope that people will take the opportunity, because I wanna talk specifically about some of the sound design you do now. Now, frankly, the first release of yours that I ever heard wasn't a music release. It was actually a, a loop system that you did for Sony as part of their, acid loop series. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>I did four of 'em, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But <span style="color:red" data-ts="788.2" data-end_ts="788.36" title="788.2" id=c_"788.2">__yeah__</span>, you did four of 'em. One of the things I would say about your work is that, and, and it's interesting because you talk about the first systems that you used being these kind of very analog systems, a MiniMogue a 1 0 6, A 1 0 1, real super analog stuff. But throughout the time I've heard your music, it's always been a very hybrid thing to me. I I never really get a sense. You don't, you don't come across as a purist from sort of a sound standpoint. I hear digital things, I hear analog things, I hear, you know, samples and sample manipulation, and you seem to not be overly conservative in any direction. You seem to sort of like, embrace it all. What, what represents sort of like your favorite, sound <span style="color:red" data-ts="837.68" data-end_ts="837.92" title="837.68" id=c_"837.68">__making__</span> pieces? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>Yeah, I mean, you're right, you're very observant about, I guess my approach. It's, it's sort of, there isn't much structure to the, the music. And that's <span style="color:red" data-ts="848.36" data-end_ts="848.48" title="848.36" id=c_"848.36">__how__</span>, that's generally on purpose. I, I, when I first started out, things were a little more song oriented, I would say. I mean, I used a couple different hardware synths, the sequencers on 'em to like literally make it into more of a song <span style="color:red" data-ts="861.2" data-end_ts="861.48" title="861.2" id=c_"861.2">__like__</span> thing. And then I just started liking the idea of spending a lot of time, sound designing with synths. And I'd come up with really cool sounds and, you know, process 'em. And then I'd record maybe, you know, a minute of that sound, whether it be looping or modulating over time or whatever. And I'd have all this folder directory of gigs of, of sound. And what I kind of like now is, and I hate to use this term because it's, it's kind of, kind of overused and it's almost cliche now, but it, it is organic, you know, in, in the way that I, I kind of approach my music because I have all this stuff that I, I program and then I assemble it, you know, after the fact rather than, okay, I gotta track here and I'm gonna play a lead, you know, and then my second track, even maybe my second track might be a drone. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>You know, I don't really do it in a rigid way like that. And some might think that that's cheating or, or whatever, but to me it's all about the final product, you know, how you, how you do it. But 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Before we go on, I, I need to sure query about that a little more. 'cause that's pretty fascinating. So you're saying that what you do is sort of immerse yourself in sound design, and then the process of creating a release is kind of going through your work and, and choosing things that'll work together and, and kind of assembling it that way? <span style="color:red" data-ts="944.87" data-end_ts="945.16" title="944.87" id=c_"944.87">__Yeah__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>75% of it is like that. Yeah. Or, and then once I get maybe like the core element of a, a song or the whole album for that matter, because lately I've been doing kind of long form releases, but have index track markers in them so that, because there are really distinct songs throughout my 70 minute album, but Right. You know, I'll focus on the, on the core of that album by, by piecing together sound design work that I've done over the course of a year. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, that's, that's fascinating. That's, that's a really interesting way to go, because, and, and actually that's kind of interesting for me because one of the things that I have trouble doing is I, I really enjoy doing sound design, but when I sit down and say, okay, I'm gonna work on a release because, you know, there's pressure for me to do a release, there's something about saying, okay, I'm gonna work on a track that makes me do some of the most inane and sad <laugh> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1004.2" data-end_ts="1004.4" title="1004.2" id=c_"1004.2">__kinda__</span> music, right. That ever comes out of me. There's something about saying, I'm making a track that makes me make a horrible track. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>Y you're, it sounds to me like you and I are very similar way it 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>In that way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>Yeah. I, I can't sit down and just make a song like I, I used to, but, and I, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1022.04" data-end_ts="1022.16" title="1022.04" id=c_"1022.04">__there__</span>, and there are a lot of people still, like that old version of Mina that, you know, my earlier releases that are more, like I say, more song oriented. There are a lot of people that actually kind of like that. But I just got to doing it this way. And I think part of it might've been because of my opportunity to do those loops with Sony, because doing those loops with Sony made, forced me into focusing on, you know, even though they're kind of short, but it forced me on sound designing for loops. Right. And what, what I found is that, when you do that, in order to make a diverse and interesting so that they can sell it, you gotta pull pieces of gear in and out of your studio. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>You got, I mean, it's like modular. I mean, even though there's not a modular in the Euro rack sense, it's modular in the sense that even, you know, a 19 inch rack, emu, planet earth synth module, I run that through different effects to make a sound that is cool for a loop library. Right. So I think then over time, what I started to do was just say, you know, I'm really good at making these soundscapes with one or two synths, and then, but it, it still didn't, wasn't full or fully finished. So I would, archive it when my, when my mind was ready to create the album, then I would go back and go through my list of all these sounds that I had and say, you know, that was really cool. That worked really well. Let's see. I'll put this here and put this here. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>And then, and then I start to overdub, maybe 30% of the rest of the project is, you know, overdubbing. And that excludes the mastering, of course, but Right. And I guess some people have picked up on that process by saying that it doesn't sound as structured, when you do it that way. Right. And, I guess that, I don't know if that's good or bad, it's just the way I do it, you know? And one of the things that when people kind of do interviews with me and ask me about stuff is, and I, I wouldn't say I'm an amateur, but I don't have any rules mm-hmm. <affirmative> when I do this. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, I just, I just do what works for me. And I don't know that much. I mean, I mean, you know, I mean, I know how, how to, how to run my studio, but I just make sounds that work for me. And, you know, spend a lot of time sound designing. And you did. And you were gonna ask me, what, what sense do I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1151.92" data-end_ts="1152.08" title="1151.92" id=c_"1151.92">__work__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I guess? Yeah. What, what is, right, what is, if you can gimme a rundown of sort of like the things that are, are your go-to sound making devices? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>Well, I have a lot of keyboards. I, I have to admit, I'm, I'm fortunate that I was able to, you know, acquire what I have. I'm kind of a hoarder, I suppose you could say. But <laugh> a lot of it, I earned it 'cause I did make money, you know, a little bit of money on the Loop library. And actually I needed it in order to make the Loop libraries and also just to continue my art. But in the last, actually the last, you know, five or six years, even though I've gone through a lot of really cool synthesizers and, and I really, like, there's something I love about every one of them. There is, there's not a bad <span style="color:red" data-ts="1186.2" data-end_ts="1186.48" title="1186.2" id=c_"1186.2">__sample__</span> in my book, in my opinion. So people say, I hate this one, or I hate this one. I can find, I can make a cool founder or, or find something kind of, kind of cool out of almost anything. The Access Virus CI series, I think are still to this day the most powerful, at least for pads, you know, a soundscape and pad machine out there. And a lot of people think that they're just a rave or trance machine mm-hmm. <affirmative>, but I think their strengths are actually more in, cinematic and, making really cool soundscapes. Right. So the, the access virus is probably my, my number one keyboard for that. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1223.04" data-end_ts="1223.28" title="1223.04" id=c_"1223.04">__Okay__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I, I agree. I think that it's a really underrated synth because it does have kind of this sense that it's a raver boy synth, but man, those filters sound so good. And the modulation routings are so interesting. It's, it's really an amazing tool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>It's, it's, it's more than that too. I mean, the, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1241.3" data-end_ts="1241.52" title="1241.3" id=c_"1241.3">__mod__</span> routing on it is excellent, but, what people forget is it's got a whole bunch of wave tables, and it also does granular synthesis, and you can modulate everything in those wave tables <span style="color:red" data-ts="1253.04" data-end_ts="1253.24" title="1253.04" id=c_"1253.04">__and__</span> then a modular or in the granular synthesis area, so you, you can create some crazy, crazy sounds and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1259.88" data-end_ts="1260.04" title="1259.88" id=c_"1259.88">__that__</span> <laugh> and for, an onboard reverb, it's not half bad. So even though I don't play live, really, I might sometimes, but it would pro, you know, it, it, it's a great standalone <span style="color:red" data-ts="1269.92" data-end_ts="1270.24" title="1269.92" id=c_"1269.92">__sense__</span> in that sense too, that you can use it, the reverbs and the, the delays on it if you're in a pinch, you know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You say you don't play live now, I, I actually saw you play live one time at, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>Jim <span style="color:red" data-ts="1281.88" data-end_ts="1282.28" title="1281.88" id=c_"1281.88">__Lamper__</span>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1282.28" data-end_ts="1282.44" title="1282.28" id=c_"1282.28">__Yes__</span>. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Lamper. Yeah. Yeah, it was you and you opened, it 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>Was Robert <span style="color:red" data-ts="1288.25" data-end_ts="1288.6" title="1288.25" id=c_"1288.25">__Cardi__</span>. Do you remember him? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, yes, that's it. That's it. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>And, he came out from Salt Lake City and we sort of had this, and I helped him come out and I said, Hey, well, why don't I open up for you? And he is like, okay, sure. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, it was, that was, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>I kind of flew by the seat of my pants on that one, but it actually turned out okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I thought it turned out great. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. I, I actually, I made a, a homemade c <span style="color:red" data-ts="1313.56" data-end_ts="1313.68" title="1313.56" id=c_"1313.56">__d__</span> r limited edition of that and sold out of every single one of 'em, I made 150 of them. So I can't complain on that one. Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1320.98" data-end_ts="1321.2" title="1320.98" id=c_"1320.98">__But__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That's great. So the virus is a big winner. What, what are some other s synths that you tend to go to a lot? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>Yeah. See, I really like the virus and, lately I, I picked up a, a Dave Smith Instruments Pro two, and I also have his mono revolver. I, I like his gear a lot. Right. I think, I think what he's done is, is pretty cool. I mean, there's a lot of movement in the sound, and I think he's doing the right thing. It doesn't sound particularly analog to me, but, you know, he is always had a, you know, Dave Smith has had a always been really kind of innovative and all about the future, you know, so I do like that. And I'm also a big fan of the Wave Station. You know, it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1363.32" data-end_ts="1363.4" title="1363.32" id=c_"1363.32">__hard__</span>, kind of hard to ignore the Wave Station. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, now the Wave Station though is, is is interesting because everything up to this point that you've mentioned, including the stuff you started with, is a synth full of knobs. Right? <span style="color:red" data-ts="1376.93" data-end_ts="1377.28" title="1376.93" id=c_"1376.93">__Right__</span>. And the Wave station was the other thing. I mean, it was the, it was the one, you know, one button, one knob, and a, and a tiny window kind of editing environment. How did you get along with that and, and what was sound design like when that was your interface? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>Well, inter it's funny you mention that because you're right. It, it's kind of notoriously the biggest pain in the ass to program. However, the, you know, they had three models. They obviously have the keyboard version, and then they had the ad, and then they have the, the 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Ssr, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>The smaller screen one, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1413.88" data-end_ts="1414" title="1413.88" id=c_"1413.88">__R__</span> Yeah. I actually, even though they, everyone complained about programming it, I didn't find it that complicated. I think for me, it got complicated when you wanted to do Vector, like a really complicated program that had, you know, four different combis on for vector synthesis. You know, I thought maybe that was <span style="color:red" data-ts="1431.72" data-end_ts="1431.88" title="1431.72" id=c_"1431.72">__any__</span> overkill anyway, unless you're doing a performance thing. Right. But when it came down to, to just programming, the Wave Station, I actually got along with it pretty well, and I used it heavily in my early two thousands work <laugh>. Okay. And even though it was kind of a sense from the nineties, but, you know, and even Robert Rich was still using his wave station on tour for many, many years, but some of the wave forms do sound a little dated now, but what's proper reverb? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>You know, you pump it through enough re and no one can really tell the difference. So <laugh>. Right. But, it's a great, it's a great evolving sounds machine and, and people have kind of left forgotten about it because there's so much more going on, on with, you know, modular synthesizers and everybody wants analog and Right. And, and I get, and I get all that, you know, I totally understand that, and it's fun and, but there's still something to be said about some of these digital machines that allowed you to, really create evolving soundscapes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, also I wonder too, it's, you know, you talk about, you know, using the, using the Wave Station in two thousands, even though it was a 19 or a nineties kind of a synth. The one thing I always wonder if we're is, if we're not too fast to abandon things for the next new shiny, shiny object. Right. Is one of the things that, you know, certainly well, like the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1519.48" data-end_ts="1519.68" title="1519.48" id=c_"1519.48">__actor__</span> Axis Virus that came out early, early-ish in the two thousands. But, you know, as you say, it's, it's grown, but also you've grown as a sound designer with it. You know, something like the Wave Station was a very complex piece of gear, and it's hard to think that, well, everyone tapped its potential in the first nine months. Right, right. And so I wonder to, to what extent we aren't too anxious to abandon technology just 'cause a new thing comes along when in fact there is al almost every machine ends up having some unique characteristic. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>Yeah. I mean, I guess I don't really know the answer to it. My, my best guess is probably manufacturers that want to, you know, be creating and, and, and, you know, selling stuff. But it's true. Once, you know, some of these machines, especially back then need time Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>To, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>To understand them and use them. But I have a, it's probably a lot has to do with just the industry. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So you say that you have a lot of keyboards. Is there something that you have that took you a long time to come to appreciate? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>A pretty easy to please <laugh>, but I think one I'm still struggling with is, a Ka K 5,000. It's the additive. It's got, I mean, it's, it's got its own unique sound for sure. But as you probably are aware, I don't know if you are or not, but it's, it's such a bear <span style="color:red" data-ts="1610.24" data-end_ts="1610.44" title="1610.24" id=c_"1610.24">__to__</span> program. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I actually had one for a short period of time. That short period of time is the giveaway. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>Right. But <span style="color:red" data-ts="1617.02" data-end_ts="1617.24" title="1617.02" id=c_"1617.02">__no__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1617.26" data-end_ts="1617.48" title="1617.26" id=c_"1617.26">__I'm__</span>, by the way, I'm also a really big fan of the Waldorf stuff. Oh yeah. But one of my first big purchases was a, a microwave xt, and I also have a queue, right. And a pulse and, and also a micro <span style="color:red" data-ts="1629.93" data-end_ts="1630.28" title="1629.93" id=c_"1629.93">__queue__</span>. So I've got, I've got several of their, their units and I've always thought they did a really good job, as well with what their, with their <span style="color:red" data-ts="1636.76" data-end_ts="1637.08" title="1636.76" id=c_"1636.76">__sense__</span>. But yeah. And I also have <span style="color:red" data-ts="1639.5" data-end_ts="1639.72" title="1639.5" id=c_"1639.5">__an__</span> an <span style="color:red" data-ts="1640.21" data-end_ts="1640.56" title="1640.21" id=c_"1640.21">__Elisa__</span> Andromeda, and I love it. It is, it can be fussy and kind of hard to tune in the right sound, but once you get the right sound, it actually sounds amazing. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, I had a chance to review that from magazine. And I remember that I was actually really kind of disappointed with the sound, you know, because it was an analog synth, and I was disappointed with the sound until I just turned off the effects processor. Right. And all of a sudden I was like, oh my God, there's all of that <laugh>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1667.31" data-end_ts="1667.6" title="1667.31" id=c_"1667.31">__that__</span> great sound that I was looking for is unfortunate that they, they hid this beautiful sound engine behind, you know, some 40 cent effects processing chip or something. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>Yeah, totally. Pretty totally. It. What is, what is funny though, is my, it's my understanding that the reverb, that's the, at least the algorithms that are, and the, the design of the reverb that's in the Andromeda is based on the wedge. And the wedge is kind of highly regarded as a really budget, but high-end or high quality sounding reverb. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>But you know what, the, the magic, by the way, for those that may have an an Andromeda and aren't and aren't sure about it, the, the real trick to it is, is turning the oscillator volumes way down, you know, a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1712.48" data-end_ts="1712.56" title="1712.48" id=c_"1712.48">__lot__</span>, everybody wants to kind of peg sound thinking that, you know, the louder, the better. But I think the, the real magic to it, even with, with, with or without the, the effects, the magic to the, andro is kind of really working and sculpting the sound by not, overdrive <span style="color:red" data-ts="1730.79" data-end_ts="1731.08" title="1730.79" id=c_"1730.79">__just__</span> the, the circuits. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, sure. Interesting. So, I wanna talk a little bit more about your sound design work with Sony, just because I'm, I've always been curious to talk to someone who's done sort of like high profile, sample stuff. Have you heard much of your own work come back to you like in commercials or anything like that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>A couple times, yeah. And it was actually really, really great. I'm pretty sure it's hard to say it was close, but <laugh>, I, I heard it on a, a promo spot for like a murder mystery show, so, you know. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1767.12" data-end_ts="1767.24" title="1767.12" id=c_"1767.12">__Oh__</span>, interesting. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1767.44" data-end_ts="1767.68" title="1767.44" id=c_"1767.44">__Which__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1767.68" data-end_ts="1767.8" title="1767.68" id=c_"1767.68">__is__</span> fitting because I, you know, you know, I Dark <span style="color:red" data-ts="1769.56" data-end_ts="1769.76" title="1769.56" id=c_"1769.56">__Am__</span> music, and then, you know, next thing you know, my, my Loops ends up on a murder mystery show. Right. And I've had a few people I consider musical colleagues that have said they've used my, my Loops, and I was really flattered and pleased to know that they got something out of it. And, and I still, I still get a few very, very small royalty checks. So someone's still buying it <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Right, right. Yeah. That's good. After all those years. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So now, you, this latest, release that you've done has been on a label called Relaxed Machinery. Yes. Tell me a little bit about that label. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>Well, it's run by three guys, John Koch, Northrop, Jeff Small and Steve Brand, all of whom, I imagine you've heard their names. But, they're kind of, they're all artists in their own right. And they've been, you know, I don't know the, the history kind of verbatim or, you know, exactly, but, you know, they started it out to have an avenue for ambient artists to release stuff without, with all the baggage of a contract. And, worrying about who takes a cut of what. I mean, what's great about these guys is they're all great people, and they basically, with the exception of the art, 'cause they have their own theme, and that makes sense. 'cause they want to, they <span style="color:red" data-ts="1851.52" data-end_ts="1851.64" title="1851.52" id=c_"1851.52">__wanna__</span> be, have an identity, but, you know, it's, it's all new, you know, I mean, you know, how do you market it, how you press it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>I mean, they do do a little bit of marketing, but, . <affirmative>, freedom with, with, the music of course. So it's a, it's a great concept. And it was just, I didn't really sh I don't really shop my music around so much <span style="color:red" data-ts="1872.14" data-end_ts="1872.36" title="1872.14" id=c_"1872.14">__is__</span> I, I just, I have something done and I kind of wanted to release with these guys because they are all friends. And I've, I've been lucky too to have a release with, Hypnos, which obviously I have, four titles. Okay. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1889.68" data-end_ts="1889.8" title="1889.68" id=c_"1889.68">__I__</span> forgot. But, four titles with Hypnos mm-hmm. <affirmative>, and, you know, they're, to me, you know, Mike and Lena that run h Hypnos Hypnos is like the big, big name in the scene and them, and Spotted <span style="color:red" data-ts="1900.88" data-end_ts="1901.12" title="1900.88" id=c_"1900.88">__Eckery__</span>. Right. And, and, and also <span style="color:red" data-ts="1904.08" data-end_ts="1904.28" title="1904.08" id=c_"1904.08">__the__</span> Spotted Eckery release. And I, and I thought, you know, this is a great opportunity for me to, to also work with these guys. So that's kind of how that came, came to be. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1912.43" data-end_ts="1912.72" title="1912.43" id=c_"1912.43">__Well__</span>, I'm, I'm, they liked it. Yeah. I'm often curious about it because people now are focusing on self releasing, or not even releasing physical media anymore, just doing digital download, releases, but <span style="color:red" data-ts="1924.65" data-end_ts="1925" title="1924.65" id=c_"1924.65">__Right__</span>. So it, it was really kind of refreshing to get, you know, a CD with a beautiful, thoughtfully done cover notes inside Nice backing the whole thing, you know, it was, it was a really, it was a real pro thing and, you know, so I wanted to ask you about, about why you chose to be on label, what <span style="color:red" data-ts="1946.56" data-end_ts="1946.84" title="1946.56" id=c_"1946.56">__kinda__</span> label it was. And it's interesting because it seems like an intersection of sort of like the self-management of a self-release, but still kind of getting the alignment that you get as being part of a label. Because like you say, you know, if you say, I have a release on hypnosis, that means something to people. Or if you say, I have a release on Spot <span style="color:red" data-ts="1967.63" data-end_ts="1967.92" title="1967.63" id=c_"1967.63">__Pcri__</span>, that means, you know, that informs people something about what you're doing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>Yeah. You're exactly spot on. And I, and I think that's kind of what those guys were, were were going for, you know, allowing the, the artists to have more freedom. Right. I guess. And, and why didn't, why didn't I choose to do it on my own? I, I could <span style="color:red" data-ts="1986.4" data-end_ts="1986.52" title="1986.4" id=c_"1986.4">__have__</span>, I suppose at this stage, I mean, I, I thought about just doing a self-release and I'm probably going to still in the future, but I still want, as far as doing a physical release, I, I am a hard physical release kind of guy, Uhhuh <affirmative>, and I have, I don't begrudge pe I don't begrudge people that, you know, want to go the digital route. I, I totally get it, but I'm also a collector, you know, I'm as a, as a music, I'm a music fan and I'm a music collector in the sense that I've, I've got a pretty large, you know, record and TV collection, and I, I, I like the physical thing and I know that there are others out there that do, and I knew I wasn't gonna make a lot of money on it, but the good news is I broke even, you know, if you can break even on some of these things, that's, that is success. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>I, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2029.84" data-end_ts="2030.12" title="2029.84" id=c_"2029.84">__wanted__</span> to give that physical thing. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2031.52" data-end_ts="2031.68" title="2031.52" id=c_"2031.52">__So__</span> for people that do like the physical thing as well. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>And I plan on keeping doing that as long as I can afford it <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure, sure. That makes a lot of sense. It's interesting. Well, and it's, it's interesting too because it seems like, it seems like that aligns with the rest of the things you've kind of revealed to us. You know, you're not a plugin guy, you're a hardware synthesizer guy, you know, and so it would make sense that you're not a virtual release guy, you're a fiscal release guy. And I think it's great, but I also think that there's some, there's some value to it. I, I did an interview, with Jeff Kaiser, who runs an experimental label, and he says, one of the things that's important is that if you want to get people to review or take your work seriously, you almost have to have a physical thing. Because if you send them an email saying, here's a release, take a listen, it just gets lost in the great avalanche of email that people get. Right. Right. But if you do a physical release, it's sitting on their desk, it kind of calls them to take a listen. Right. And I think for, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2099.18" data-end_ts="2099.4" title="2099.18" id=c_"2099.18">__oh__</span> yeah. For, people who buy things, it, it also, it has that kind of aspect of saying, well, you bought me, let's, let's take a listen <laugh>. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>Right. Yeah. And, and in a way too, just, for me, it <span style="color:red" data-ts="2114.08" data-end_ts="2114.32" title="2114.08" id=c_"2114.08">__there__</span>, it's just the idea that here's my art that I spent a couple years on, someone's able to kind of hold it and at least admire it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Well, I've used <span style="color:red" data-ts="2124.62" data-end_ts="2124.84" title="2124.62" id=c_"2124.62">__to__</span> a lot of your time already. I appreciate you spending the time. I have just, I have one more question, which, , sure. Which I'm anxious to hear your response to. What, what does the future represent for you? Where are you gonna go in the future? More of the same, or do you have, do you have evil plans? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>Yeah, you know, I think it's probably gonna be more of the same. There's sort of a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2147.01" data-end_ts="2147.36" title="2147.01" id=c_"2147.01">__still__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2147.36" data-end_ts="2147.56" title="2147.36" id=c_"2147.36">__the__</span> comfort level and, and, and doing what I do. And, and, I, I do want to, play live. It's gonna be challenging for me because, you know, when you're a one man show, you know, and, and actually I don't even use a, a computer when I play live, so I'm not sure how that's gonna go, but lots of looping and, and, live looping and stuff like that. But, the future hold what the future holds for me. I don't know. I've got a lot of, a lot of stuff I've recorded and, I gotta sift through it and figure out where, where it's headed. I might, I think too, I, since I recently picked up the, Dave Smith, pro two, I might put together a patch bank for it or, or something like that, which I forgot to mention, by the way. I, one of the things about the access virus is I recently released a, patch bank for it that I'm selling. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's fantastic. Do you think you're gonna do any more Loop library work? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Jesse: </b>You know, I talked to Tony about it a little bit, I think, I'm not sure. We, we almost got there, but they kind of shifted gears on me a little bit. So I'm not really sure. I doubt it. I doubt it, but
