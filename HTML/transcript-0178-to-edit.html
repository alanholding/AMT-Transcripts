<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Thanks a lot for tuning in today. I'm gonna give a little intro here because it's really important. Cristian Vogel. Today's guest is about to put on a spatial sound and music piece, but it really, it's an overall performance. It's called The Ballad of Anetta and the Merman, and it's going to be at the <span style="color:red" data-ts="27.635" data-end_ts="27.925" title="27.635" id=c_"27.635">__Gods__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="27.925" data-end_ts="28.085" title="27.925" id=c_"27.925">__Band__</span> in our house, in our house, Denmark. He talks a lot about it at the end of the podcast, and I think when you hear about it, you're really gonna be intrigued by what's going on. If you want to take a look at it, if you happen to be in the area, and you're gonna be able to go and see this, I strongly recommend it. It sounds like it's an amazing get together of a large group of people, a lot of technologists getting involved in this thing, and it sounds amazing. So if you get a chance, you're gonna want to do it. The name of the piece again, is Anetta and the the Merman. You can find a link to it on the show page if you got here via, iTunes, you're gonna be able to see it in the comment part of the iTunes episode. In any case, enjoy this discussion with Cristian and take a look at that. It's really interesting. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>This week I have the great, opportunity to meet someone who's, who's introduced to me by one of the listeners that introduced me to this guy's music, and I was pretty well blown away. And so I've been listening kind of on constant turnover ever since. His name's Cristian Vogel, based out <span style="color:red" data-ts="99.165" data-end_ts="99.245" title="99.165" id=c_"99.165">__of__</span> Copenhagen. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian Vogel: </b>Hi, Darwin. Yes. I'm <laugh>. I'm in, Copenhagen. I'm living in Copenhagen right now. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So let me say hi to you. Hi, Cristian. Thank you so much for being part of the podcast. I really appreciate it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>Thank you for the invitation. It's great to be here. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So let's start off, for people who, don't know your work, let's start off by giving them a brief overview of your work. What are the kinds of things that you do and what are the areas that you're exploring right now? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>I'm, I'm still very, concerned with electronic music. Those are my, my end. You know, the language that I'm expressing myself in is, <span style="color:red" data-ts="137.645" data-end_ts="137.805" title="137.645" id=c_"137.645">__is__</span> electronic sound, because I, I went into indie rock for a while and, <laugh> other forms, but, I'm sort of more into it than than ever at the moment. And I'm exploring quite, I've been researching quite intensively the, multi-channel work and spatial composition, primarily using a technology called, Wayfield Synthesis and, multi-speaker composing for multi-speaker installations. That's, mostly what I'm focusing on. But then this all implies, quite a focus on the sound design aspects of music creation. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="179.725" data-end_ts="179.765" title="179.725" id=c_"179.725">__So__</span>, I feel that I'm, for the last, maybe some of the listeners will disagree, but I would say for the last three or four years I've been more and more concerned with pushing the levels of sound design itself, beyond simply production and into really that the compositional structures that sound design can, well, it sort of demands, if you're gonna work in that way, it, it, it demands a new type of compositional thinking, and hence the, the push into spatial spatialization and spatial thinking. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. It's really interesting that you say that because just recently, in the podcast, I've, I've talked to a number of people who really kind of identify as sound design as being the, the core, almost the core, their core instrument is sound design rather than any specific instrument or tool or software or whatever. Right. And Mm-Hmm. But it's interesting to think of this idea that the compositional structure and maybe even the physical nature of, of hearing the sound needs to change in order to support that kind of, that kind of perspective. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>Right. Yeah. That, that's definitely something that, I, I realized on a residency, I was awarded a residency at the Z km in <span style="color:red" data-ts="259.605" data-end_ts="259.845" title="259.605" id=c_"259.605">__Carl__</span> Yeah. At the beginning of, 20 16, 4 weeks kind <span style="color:red" data-ts="265.805" data-end_ts="265.885" title="265.805" id=c_"265.805">__of__</span> artist in residence on a program called Points on the Curve. And, they were working with the four D Sound system at that time, <span style="color:red" data-ts="272.025" data-end_ts="272.245" title="272.025" id=c_"272.025">__or__</span> it was part of the four D Sound system, which is a big physical structure of a sounds of a spatial sound system, quite an industrial structure with lots of omni speakers embedded in a kind of a cube system. So it's, it's a 56, 56 channel system, and they, that was in residency at the Z km. And then I was in, invited to come and do some weeks exploring my music on that system. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And quite early on in that very privileged situation, I, I realized a, I'm in a very good position to explore spatial sound, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="310.825" data-end_ts="311.045" title="310.825" id=c_"310.825">__be__</span> it, the sound design aspect becomes, goes right to the front. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I mean, there's, that's the way to explore it. What I found is if you, if you work with styles <span style="color:red" data-ts="321.625" data-end_ts="321.845" title="321.625" id=c_"321.625">__and__</span> genres, and I heard some examples that they played there, and I, I wasn't very impressed with, with the lack of stylistic innovation. So here you've got a completely new way of representing sound in space. Right. Why start to try and use a form of expression that is stylistically not novel, you know, <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Or, or not even attached to that kind of, that kind of environment in any way. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>I mean, I asked that question to myself. It's, it was just a sort of standard to, to set for myself. 'cause I knew that, obviously that the people who were trying to, to commercialize facial sound as <span style="color:red" data-ts="358.685" data-end_ts="358.805" title="358.685" id=c_"358.685">__a__</span>, or systems that they're, they're, they actually seem to be all quite focused on, the cinematic experience, the things that we, we already are quite accustomed to, let's say the cliche of the helicopter flowing around. Right. And then there, there's also some, some inroads into DJ effects using spatial sound as an extra effect that the DJ can do when he's about to drop the fill in, he can do a, <span style="color:red" data-ts="385.085" data-end_ts="385.205" title="385.085" id=c_"385.085">__a__</span>, a pan trajectory of the snare drum roll or something <laugh>. Right, right. And this seems to be the, current, direction. Po pos probably driven by market forces, I would say, looking back, and I, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="398.525" data-end_ts="398.645" title="398.525" id=c_"398.525">__heard__</span>, I was lucky in that residency at the end to hear a very special concert, which was a, <span style="color:red" data-ts="403.245" data-end_ts="403.365" title="403.245" id=c_"403.245">__a__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="404.085" data-end_ts="404.205" title="404.085" id=c_"404.085">__a__</span> quick, quite quickly, a specialized version of, <span style="color:red" data-ts="409.515" data-end_ts="409.805" title="409.515" id=c_"409.515">__cuss__</span>, oxidant orient, which is a tape piece on four mono channels. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>As far as I know, that piece wasn't spatialized by <span style="color:red" data-ts="419.285" data-end_ts="419.485" title="419.285" id=c_"419.285">__Zenna__</span>, but Paul Oman from the four D Sound System, he spatialized it for this concept evening that we all did something at. And this was the sort of opening piece. But I was really lucky to, to be able to hear him in the empty room with nobody there the day before. You know, the technical rehearsal. Right. Just exploring those, those stems from that really bit rare and special tape piece. And I was just blown away by the sound design <span style="color:red" data-ts="446.795" data-end_ts="447.085" title="446.795" id=c_"446.795">__that__</span> SCUs was doing. It's like, there was nothing, I think it's from the early seventies or late sixties, but <span style="color:red" data-ts="452.845" data-end_ts="453.005" title="452.845" id=c_"452.845">__there__</span> I couldn't, I didn't have that feeling that I get with so much contemporary electronic music where I know the processes behind it. Right. So I said, this sound is a, a granular, not very good granular clap or something, you know, that's a, that's an exponential reverse envelope on a, <span style="color:red" data-ts="471.405" data-end_ts="471.525" title="471.405" id=c_"471.405">__a__</span> white noise things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>So I didn't have any of that. It was every sound was just completely immediately out there in its design and in its sheer power and aggression. And, and the quality I got more than anything from hearing, hearing those sounds was some type of a menace. It was a feeling of menace in the sounds <laugh>. Right. Wow. And I thought, oh, that's, yeah, that's good sound design. Yeah. That's the stuff I'm talking about here. Completely abstract, no reference to any of the processes that I could recognize having worked 25 years in, right at the edge of sound design and just, I couldn't, I could, okay. I tell you the tools. Sure. I knew the time that he, the technology was around when he must've been composing that we we're talking filter banks and, you know, band <span style="color:red" data-ts="516.765" data-end_ts="516.965" title="516.765" id=c_"516.765">__pass__</span> filters, generators. There's a lot of the stuff that's up in the eurorack right now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>But just the, the potency of the compositional thinking going on in the arrangement of those sounds in its time, space and the way they, the expression contained in, in their quality, the quality of the sounds themselves. So anyway, that's the stuff that I heard early on, and I thought, wow, when this is, when this is spatialized, it comes out, <span style="color:red" data-ts="541.155" data-end_ts="541.445" title="541.155" id=c_"541.155">__whoa__</span>, you don't hear an electroacoustic piece. Like, you don't get so into the stylized aspect of it. Like, oh, well that's electroacoustic music, what you hear, is this sound design as it's supposed to be experienced? I thought, yes, I must get my stuff specialized <laugh>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="559.615" data-end_ts="559.965" title="559.615" id=c_"559.615">__Right__</span>. How do I do it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So given that you're not gonna be able to spend your whole life at, in Carls <span style="color:red" data-ts="566.725" data-end_ts="566.885" title="566.725" id=c_"566.725">__rock__</span>, how are, how do you work in that specialization world once you're Yes. Once you're away from that kind of research facility? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>Yes. It's a very good question because one of the, of course practical, the practical issue that is stopping the diversity or has been restricting the diversity of spatial sound composition, meaning the, exploration of its possible aesthetic directions and so on. It's the fact that you need loads of kit. You need a bunch of speakers, some pro, a lot of pretty heavy duty processing computational power. You need to understand some of the science of acoustics. You need to be quite precise in your setup and listening environments. Amplifiers, cabling, everything just multiplies up a lot. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="619.105" data-end_ts="619.325" title="619.105" id=c_"619.105">__but__</span> in cost and in complication. So, yes, it's a good question because it's like, how do you, how do you compose, how do you begin to explore the interesting stuff in a way, which is the, the art form, right? Right. So how can you do that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>Now since, since then, I worked with, that was the main priority for me was to, find out how to do this. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="641.965" data-end_ts="642.005" title="641.965" id=c_"641.965">__I__</span>, I started researching more about the conventions of, cinema around the and five one. And I've worked in quadraphonic and onic before. More quadraphonic than anything. I think most people go from stereo to quad at some point. Right, right. I dunno. A clubs tend to have <span style="color:red" data-ts="661.365" data-end_ts="661.485" title="661.365" id=c_"661.365">__a__</span> couple of, couple more speakers on polls, you know, and they give you <laugh>, let's put some, let's put some at the back and let's put some at the front. And, and it's quite crude and basic, but we, this is okay to work with, but I, I, I wanted to get more, more serious. So I looked at these other forms, and I've been learning that there is, for example, different panning systems and this stuff, some of them go back quite away into the ambisonics higher order ambisonics, which, some of your listeners might be familiar with. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>Right. I'm just making a comeback. In fact, due to the VR streaming of Facebook 360 and Google, YouTube, vr, they're all running <span style="color:red" data-ts="702.765" data-end_ts="702.885" title="702.765" id=c_"702.765">__a__</span> first order ambisonics, which is quite interesting. But we might, yeah, we might get back to that <laugh>, that's from the seventies in a way. And then the other technology is, they call it vap, this lovely acronym vap. Sounds like a interesting sandwich. <laugh>. And, yeah. So there, there's this staff, which, which I've had access to with my, my <span style="color:red" data-ts="724.925" data-end_ts="725.165" title="724.925" id=c_"724.925">__chemo__</span> system. I know you've <span style="color:red" data-ts="727.105" data-end_ts="727.325" title="727.105" id=c_"727.105">__in__</span> an interview with Carlos <span style="color:red" data-ts="728.385" data-end_ts="728.605" title="728.385" id=c_"728.385">__ti__</span>, right? Yeah. I point, correct. Yeah. Guru, she creates the chemo. So I have, I think it's feedback panning in, in chemo. And I know that in max there's, the very deep, spat <span style="color:red" data-ts="741.065" data-end_ts="741.285" title="741.065" id=c_"741.065">__bri__</span> cam, I looked into this stuff. I'm not a, a max user, so I couldn't explore that at all. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>And instead, I, during that, that research phase of how can I do this at home? I met, some guys in Paris at a company called Sonic Emotion who were trying to put a, a turnkey, wayfield synthesis system on the market. What that means is it's a sort of black box that does all of the computation for you so that your computer doesn't have to overheat too much doing that. <span style="color:red" data-ts="772.795" data-end_ts="773.085" title="772.795" id=c_"772.795">__Okay__</span>. They, they're quite clever. 'cause they seem to have, started from that point, the question you asked me. So they had already created a way of composing using OSC signals to do your trajectories and stuff, and their own visualizer. And this could be rendered on their WFS engine at the top end of a, of an installation. So if you happen to have more than 24 speakers, or 24 speakers at least, or upwards, you can use their system to render that stuff right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>In the space. That's for quite a big budget scenario. But you can also use the same software to render down to a binaural rendering. Right. Or five one output or, Octa output. So it, the algorithm takes the composition thinking and simply renders it into these different formats. And that will probably be the, what we'll see happening more and more is it probably is already happening now. I think the new version of spat is very much in this direction as well. Similar vein. Yeah. Yeah. So that's how, that's how it goes now. So I've got a little five one, well, actually a hexagon at home. 'cause you can have quite arbitrary shapes. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, and I'm working, just on six speakers, but in WFS, 'cause <span style="color:red" data-ts="848.565" data-end_ts="848.685" title="848.565" id=c_"848.565">__I__</span>, I, I'm using the technology for my piece. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You know, the, the wayfield synthesis stuff has come up in <span style="color:red" data-ts="856.525" data-end_ts="856.765" title="856.525" id=c_"856.525">__this__</span> in discussions in the past. But I have to admit not really knowing anything about it. Is there, is there sort of like a layman's quick run through of what the technology does? Or is it just, is it too black boxy to even bother with 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b><laugh>? Well, there's a, a lot of this field of spatial stuff is very academic and technical. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and a lot of it's to do with acoustics and, mathematics. So I don't know much about that level, but I can tell you just from my experience with it, that it seems to, everything has its pros and cons in a way. Right. So I think one of its strengths is that it can translate a lot better your compositional work at home in the studio like this, for example, into a bigger space, a bigger room into high SBL speakers. I've already done, installation in Aoss in Denmark for a couple of weeks on 24 a PG speakers, quite small <span style="color:red" data-ts="917.825" data-end_ts="918.045" title="917.825" id=c_"917.825">__six__</span>, five inch speakers. And that was the proof of the pudding, if you like. It did my work translated really well onto that setup once I programmed the speaker positions and said, Hey, this is where everything is. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And the system <span style="color:red" data-ts="931.925" data-end_ts="932.485" title="931.925" id=c_"931.925">__computes__</span> its filters and then, the panning really, feels like it's using all of the space. And the other thing that is very strong is that you can, as a listener, you can move anywhere in that space within the speaker field. So inside the speaker circle or shape whatever, you can go and listen from one side. And what you'll have is simply a different perception of the spatial trajectories. I see. Okay. Rather whole spatial image falling apart. Yeah. Which is how some of the other systems, what happens is if you <span style="color:red" data-ts="964.385" data-end_ts="964.605" title="964.385" id=c_"964.385">__got__</span> get too close to one of the speakers, you just hear that speaker. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. That was, that's been my experience with, with kind of massive multichannel stuff, is that if you're in a sweet spot, it's amazing. <span style="color:red" data-ts="976.315" data-end_ts="976.605" title="976.315" id=c_"976.315">__Yeah__</span>. As soon as you wander off a little bit off <span style="color:red" data-ts="979.705" data-end_ts="980.125" title="979.705" id=c_"979.705">__access__</span>, it <span style="color:red" data-ts="980.845" data-end_ts="981.045" title="980.845" id=c_"980.845">__does__</span> the, the wheels start falling off and it, and then it becomes, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="986.225" data-end_ts="986.445" title="986.225" id=c_"986.225">__you__</span> you sort of like, well, if this was in stereo, I would still be enjoying it. Right. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>Yeah. And then you, you feel a bit uncomfortable that you're not in the sweet spot. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. Yeah. You get, right. It ends up being a power struggle for among the listeners. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>One of these, you, you one of these members of the audience that likes to go right by the mixing desk at a concert <laugh>. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>Because that's the best sounding part of the room. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Although sometimes when I do that, I find out that the person that's running sound is probably deaf because it sounded no better there than it did anywhere else. Right. <laugh>. Anyway. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>But the thing is, it does, you're right. And this, this system, the WFS system that I'm using, there's different implementations by the way, but the one that I'm using seems to really have a very wide, sweet spot. I wouldn't even call it a spot anymore. Right. It's quite a big zone where you can have an enjoyable experience. The other thing that's quite odd, I I noticed with it is that if you walk right up to a speaker, 'cause my, I've positioned the virtual source there. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, and you, you program this stuff with virtual objects flying around a visualizer and the, the WFS system makes it appear in the space there. So as you walk towards where you think that sound is, and you're thinking that it's coming from the speaker, or you're used to walking towards a speaker and just getting that speaker in your face, what happens is it's almost, it sort of slips away from you and becomes louder. But not that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1074.565" data-end_ts="1074.805" title="1074.565" id=c_"1074.565">__it's__</span> because it's you're closest to the speaker, it's louder because you're standing in the away from 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>In the, in the, in the sound itself. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>Yeah. Interesting. You're standing in the sound, so it's, that sound is louder for you. But then that's what's interesting because you turn around or you've tried to focus your awareness towards the other side of the room where you've just come from and Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, there's you, you are aware that there's other sounds going on there too. Right. So, you don't get that with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1099.085" data-end_ts="1099.205" title="1099.085" id=c_"1099.085">__a__</span>, this what I've worked with before, which is just circular paneling in a way, you know? Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well that's really interesting. So one, one last question on this before we, we continue on, but I'm really curious, you mentioned this idea of, it's sort of like upscaling into, so are you saying that like within your six speaker system you can work, you can put together, functional movements, but if you go into a 56 speaker thing that that translates into just a more detailed version of the same thing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>Not detailed, but just a different version with, with all of the, the dynamics that having that many good quality speakers will, will bring to you. And it will get the best out of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1144.805" data-end_ts="1144.965" title="1144.805" id=c_"1144.805">__the__</span> those having that many speakers in a way ing because if, if you just put a big pile of speakers in and feed your mono signal to all of them, you just get massive pa wall of sound. Right. Which is what we all, what we all love actually in, in the conventional pa set. That's what, that's when we say it's a good system, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The physicality of it. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>Yeah. It's, when it's like that, it's just blasting you and making you shake and all that. So you can do that too. If you're smart and you've got big sub <span style="color:red" data-ts="1174.015" data-end_ts="1174.365" title="1174.015" id=c_"1174.015">__bases__</span>, you can do that sort of stuff. 'cause that energy really comes from the bot <span style="color:red" data-ts="1176.765" data-end_ts="1176.965" title="1176.765" id=c_"1176.765">__end__</span>. What it really does, I think, is help you tune, work with the room better and work with that many speakers in a room in a better way. That's what I meant by sort of upscaling, so that you're not completely, panicking when you set up the bigger installation. And it sounds like everything is just resonating and booming and the things that you, we all normally experience at soundcheck on a stereo pa, you know, the soundcheck is just, or most artists will tell you that a soundcheck is not to check your sound. It's just to see how horrible it sounds in that <laugh> in the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1210.605" data-end_ts="1210.805" title="1210.605" id=c_"1210.605">__<inaudible>__</span>, you know, how, how whether your music is really, really gonna sound really bad or <span style="color:red" data-ts="1215.715" data-end_ts="1216.005" title="1215.715" id=c_"1215.715">__Okay__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1216.005" data-end_ts="1216.165" title="1216.005" id=c_"1216.005">__or__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Just kind of bad <laugh> <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>And so that's the check. Occasionally you get a a a really good experience, you know, but there's so many things that, a pa must really be tuned and must be good quality and, and it's very much tuned to the room, isn't it? So, right. The, one of the foundational points of spatial sound, I think is tuning it to the room. It's the spatial aspects. So a good spatial system will give you lots of tools to, tune the, the speaker array in the room, and then you, you, render your spatial composition on it. That I I heard that phrase. Oh, instead of saying playback, these guys in Paris, they were talking about doing a rendering. Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1261.605" data-end_ts="1261.885" title="1261.605" id=c_"1261.605">__Like__</span>, ah, he, he's gonna do his rendering tomorrow night, night composite. It's, it's done in real time, but it is, basically a kind of rendering, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's a, yeah, it's an APTT use of the phrase because, because there's so much computation going on at the point that it's being presented that it is in real time, but it is a rendering That's, that's interesting. That's an interesting way to put it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>Yeah. And it has this little, little bit bit more ritualistic kind of touch to it, isn't it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, it does. You're right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>I'm not gonna play my music. I'm gonna render it. We're gonna do rendering. I quite, I've been trying to drop it, drop it around, with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1300.685" data-end_ts="1300.885" title="1300.685" id=c_"1300.685">__the__</span> sound people, sound technicians and stuff, and they, they look at me for me, <laugh>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1305.865" data-end_ts="1306.085" title="1305.865" id=c_"1305.865">__So__</span> yes, I'm not ready to render yet. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So I, one of the things I like doing in my podcast is kind of talking about how artists became, became what they've become, just because it really opens doors for other people to kind of get inspiration out of that, or, you know, feel like, feel like they have a chance to do it too. Right. Now, I'm especially curious with you because, you know, you just kind of explained the process you went through in embracing, the specialization kind of stuff, right. But you're pretty well known for being a big Kea guy, the you, the symbolic Sounds Kea system. And I'm curious like how you came to be, how you came to embrace that and what it is that got you to the point that, that all of these sort of like ex this concept of sound design as a com, not only a compositional tool, but sort of like informing your compositional techniques. How did you get all of these things kind of pulled together to become the, the person that's putting out this amazing music? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>I think, let's see, way back machine, way back in the past there was, there was an eight bit computer with a 6, 5 0 2 chip in it all the way back, because I started programming home compute <span style="color:red" data-ts="1397.875" data-end_ts="1398.165" title="1397.875" id=c_"1397.875">__some__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1398.165" data-end_ts="1398.365" title="1398.165" id=c_"1398.165">__from__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1398.365" data-end_ts="1398.525" title="1398.365" id=c_"1398.365">__that__</span>. I'm 44, I'm from born in 1972. And I first got into electronic music by programming little, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1408.595" data-end_ts="1408.885" title="1408.595" id=c_"1408.595">__ASCI__</span> based sequences on my ORIC one computer, <laugh>. So I must have been about 13 or 14, 12, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1417.965" data-end_ts="1418.165" title="1417.965" id=c_"1417.965">__dunno__</span>. Nice. I can't remember that generation of, what, what would you call us? I don't know, <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The, it was, you were hackers back when it didn't mean that you were going to jail. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>Yeah. Right. And I, I was doing the typing in from the computer games for magazines Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>And picking up techniques and tips how to do, I went <span style="color:red" data-ts="1440.485" data-end_ts="1440.645" title="1440.485" id=c_"1440.485">__into__</span> more some music in my games that I was writing. And, and I remember <span style="color:red" data-ts="1444.905" data-end_ts="1445.125" title="1444.905" id=c_"1444.905">__for__</span> the Scandinavian guys were always putting these programs in these magazines. And that's where I saw that you could just make a string definition of a load of letters and numbers. You could go a two a two A, two B, three B, three B, three C four C four C four, and then read through that and use the numbers, the duration, and the letter as the pitch. I said, oh, that's, that's super cool. I took, I understood that ear early on. And then I had loads of ways of writing music and I was even putting in score sheet score music from this simple system <laugh>. Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1477.615" data-end_ts="1477.965" title="1477.615" id=c_"1477.615">__Reach__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1477.965" data-end_ts="1478.165" title="1477.965" id=c_"1477.965">__out__</span>. Yeah. So I had, I got quite into the music part of the game <span style="color:red" data-ts="1481.915" data-end_ts="1482.205" title="1481.915" id=c_"1481.915">__that__</span> I was writing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>The game was pretty irrelevant. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, that was really early on. So I've always had this very intuitive association between the computational aspects of music and, and of music. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> how, how music is a lot of, specification. Some music, not all music, but some of it is specifying parameters and then, exploring them over time. Right. So a really basic definition of some type of music. I think that early experience is like <span style="color:red" data-ts="1510.685" data-end_ts="1510.805" title="1510.685" id=c_"1510.685">__sequence__</span> sequences, right. Sequencing, I guess. So when I got into what, as we were kind of waiting for technology to catch up a bit back then, but in the meantime I played in punk bands and got into the Sex Pistols and I was growing up in the uk This is mid eighties. And just, yeah, general disenchanted youth. I, I, my, when I look back, I, I feel a lot of boredom just waiting for, I was waiting for technology to happen for, for it to just kind of <laugh>, you know, happen more. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>'cause the computers were, were so cool, but it seemed to be very slow. I remember being <span style="color:red" data-ts="1547.165" data-end_ts="1547.285" title="1547.165" id=c_"1547.165">__a__</span>, one of these teenagers that just really wants to get on with it, finish school really fast. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1551.765" data-end_ts="1552.005" title="1551.765" id=c_"1551.765">__They__</span> just want to get on with this thing with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1554.325" data-end_ts="1554.445" title="1554.325" id=c_"1554.325">__the__</span>, because that's why I got into punk music and alternative culture because it was seemed to be a, a good way to, a good place to kind of wait and hang around <laugh> in these, in the rehearsal room and banging drums and doing feedback on guitars and all that. Then I heard Acid House on the News Uhhuh, this was in the UK in the eighties, the Castle Wharton party, which is many, think of it as sort of the critical mass point of, of the illegal free party movement in 1988 or something in the uk. And it was on the news and suddenly in the media, this music and its mass gathering of people around music and acid house, and they were doing news features on it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>And so I went out there on my bike, didn't really catch the core of that, party. 'cause that was quite near where I was growing up, by the way, I didn't mention it in the Midlands in the uk Yeah. But just got a taste for the cultural part. I said, okay, so here's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1611.165" data-end_ts="1611.285" title="1611.165" id=c_"1611.165">__the__</span>, here's the music that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1612.525" data-end_ts="1612.725" title="1612.525" id=c_"1612.525">__they__</span>, and the music also was real out there, the acid house. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1616.345" data-end_ts="1616.565" title="1616.345" id=c_"1616.345">__And__</span> like Yes. What, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1617.535" data-end_ts="1617.885" title="1617.535" id=c_"1617.535">__where__</span>, where is that coming from? What is that? That's nothing to do with guitars or <laugh>. So I, I think early on that I'm lucky, I'm really fortunate by the way, when, when I tell these stories, 'cause I'm really fortunate to have lived through a genuine relu cultural revolution, I think attached to a music musical <span style="color:red" data-ts="1638.275" data-end_ts="1638.565" title="1638.275" id=c_"1638.275">__form__</span>. And I think a lot of the nineties producers and the 2000 producers, that came after that, how can they know what that was like? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>They can just hear about it, but they can't really know what it was like. Right. It was genuinely mind blowing <laugh>. And I remember listening to Stack of Humanoid and, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1660.945" data-end_ts="1661.165" title="1660.945" id=c_"1660.945">__ac__</span> Amigo tapes and, all this stuff and just didn't understand any of it. And, but I would sample it all on my Amiga and remix it <laugh>. Right. So all the time there was this kind of computer aspect that I was working with since I was a kid. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1677.785" data-end_ts="1678.005" title="1677.785" id=c_"1677.785">__So__</span> how can I explore this musical form through my computer by sampling chunks and slowing it down and, and doing all this stuff and making it go backwards and then try and copy the same style that they're doing. But on a, on pro tracker, you know, and just <laugh>. So I got really into it. And also more and more into going into the parties and the events and hearing these sounds on PA systems. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. 'cause sound system culture is a largely overlooked fact of this. That, plugin, a 9 0 9 and a 3 0 3 into your home speakers is one thing that, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1710.545" data-end_ts="1710.765" title="1710.545" id=c_"1710.545">__you__</span> know, speakers will probably blow up. Right? <laugh>, unless you've got some good ones. But plugging it into a, a pa that, at that, that time a lot of the PAs weren't designed for rock music, or the good ones were for more like dub systems, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1727.525" data-end_ts="1727.745" title="1727.525" id=c_"1727.525">__you__</span> know? Mm-Hmm. And the, this techno system started to emerge, which were more tuned to heavy bass and, and presence in the, in the mid-range. You know, and you start to hear these new types of sound systems that incredibly loud and going to the big raves in the uk, I went to a few of those jungle raves, and hearing DJs like, groove Rider and Fabio and so on. And you hear, I mean, massive halls absolutely slamming with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1760.175" data-end_ts="1760.465" title="1760.175" id=c_"1760.175">__base__</span> and PA systems, just so the sound system culture is very much involved in all of that too. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>But that's where I started to hear how, amplification massively scales up the beautiful stuff going on in the electronic sound, and the people too. Of course. So then, but then after a lot of this, I got completely into it. And I graduated from university. I got my degree in, in 20th century music, by the way, <laugh>. I studied, modernism in music. Oh, awesome. And, I, I, but I, I graduated in 1995 from the University of Sussex, and then I had this degree that was within five years, was a century out of date <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>And it really felt like that, 'cause that's what it felt like out there on the scene when I was touring at that time <span style="color:red" data-ts="1817.665" data-end_ts="1817.885" title="1817.665" id=c_"1817.665">__as__</span>, oh man, this is going to Germany and all over the place and watching the culture accelerate and the music change and change and change. And there was very little reference to the past at that point. Right. People weren't, I didn't really hear good, tape music and all of the foundations of electronic music until quite later actually. Thanks to the internet. Really? 'cause there's, you can hear all that early tape music and stuff now, can't you, on Spotify? Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I understand. It was shocking. I mean, it <span style="color:red" data-ts="1848.285" data-end_ts="1848.365" title="1848.285" id=c_"1848.285">__was__</span>, it used to be so hard to find. Right. It 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>Was so hard to find it. I was studying it and I couldn't find it. I just had to read about it in books. Right. Try and write an essay about something I'd never heard, like writing an essay about stock housing's. Contactor <span style="color:red" data-ts="1861.565" data-end_ts="1861.725" title="1861.565" id=c_"1861.565">__was__</span> like, how can I hear that <laugh>? Right. Right. So anyway, the sound palette and, was always around. And I was also quite influenced by some of the records that I did here, like Morton Niks, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1875.885" data-end_ts="1876.245" title="1875.885" id=c_"1875.885">__silver__</span>, apples <span style="color:red" data-ts="1876.645" data-end_ts="1876.805" title="1876.645" id=c_"1876.645">__of__</span> Moon, and so on. So some of the, I sampled that a lot in the early, early years 'cause I was very attracted to the, the sounds there. Only <span style="color:red" data-ts="1884.925" data-end_ts="1885.205" title="1884.925" id=c_"1884.925">__late__</span> to do <span style="color:red" data-ts="1885.445" data-end_ts="1885.525" title="1885.445" id=c_"1885.445">__it__</span>, of course. Do I discover it's all booklet and <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>That's why they're awesome. But, yeah. So how did I get then? I, I think we're about 20, 20 year, how old am I? 25. Mid, mid twenties now. And then I went out and just toured and played and played and produced and played and, and just got caught in the wave, like so many of us early nineties pioneers, you know? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, my, my most intense output with the records on Rezo and so on, that was all in, 92 to 97, I mean, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1924.925" data-end_ts="1925.085" title="1924.925" id=c_"1924.925">__to__</span> like five years of two albums a year or something. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1928.265" data-end_ts="1928.485" title="1928.265" id=c_"1928.265">__Wow__</span>. It's very, very tracky I recall. No editing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, really? It was, you were just literally pounding it out that quick. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>Yeah. Recently, for Osa, compilation the OSA label in Brussels. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. They wanted to work with me on, the, recovering my archive material from the nineties, which, which I did from <span style="color:red" data-ts="1954.035" data-end_ts="1954.255" title="1954.035" id=c_"1954.035">__dat__</span> tapes. And, it was a really nice project, actually, crowdfunded, thanks to all <span style="color:red" data-ts="1960.725" data-end_ts="1960.925" title="1960.725" id=c_"1960.725">__you__</span> fans out there, <laugh>, really honestly, 'cause I didn't, I was gonna throw the tapes away. Oh, my I'd, I'd already discarded them and left them in my mom's attic. And, she was moving house and she called me up and said, Hey Cristian, you know, what, what do you wanna do with all this? These little tapes? <span style="color:red" data-ts="1981.025" data-end_ts="1981.245" title="1981.025" id=c_"1981.025">__We__</span>, and she called me up, I was a bit depressed when she called me, actually, for one reason or another, you know. And then I said, oh, just throw that, throw that rubbish out. I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Don't, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1990.085" data-end_ts="1990.285" title="1990.085" id=c_"1990.085">__is__</span> it a bunch of dat tapes? You said a bunch. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1992.525" data-end_ts="1992.725" title="1992.525" id=c_"1992.525">__Da__</span> a load of little tapes in the shoebox <laugh>. Oh dear. I said, just, oh, I know what they are. Just, just throw that shit out, you know, I don't care. I don't even have a tape machine anymore. Whatever. And being a mom, she's so awesome. You know, mom's there just, she sent it to me anyway. She just sent me the box through the post, all, all taped up. And, that's where I started to look through these tapes. I'm like, oh man, some of them are still good condition. And I was in Berlin at that time, and it was relatively straightforward to go to dub plates and mastering and borrow their adapt machine and so on. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I was interested, but my girlfriend and she encouraged me to say, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2031.625" data-end_ts="2031.845" title="2031.625" id=c_"2031.625">__Hey__</span>, you know, this stuff is means something to some people. You should try and get out or something. I said, okay. So I did a little crowdfunding campaign just to see what the interest was, really to gauge the interest. And, and they, raised the quite a few thousand, which I needed to do all of the mastery. It's a lot of stuff. So that was really cool. And then I went through all the tapes. Now the reason I'm mentioning this is 'cause I went through the tapes and they were like a time capsule 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>Of the studio at that time in <span style="color:red" data-ts="2057.365" data-end_ts="2057.485" title="2057.365" id=c_"2057.365">__the__</span>, in that really active time. Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2059.385" data-end_ts="2059.605" title="2059.385" id=c_"2059.385">__And__</span> the, wow, two things struck me that was really interesting, listening back to those tapes. And one of them is that there would be this flow of track that was released on absolute time track that was released on absolute Time track that was released later on the other album that came after that one track that was released on the ep. There's no, there's no fillers on the tapes. And I know that I wasn't editing 'cause I had no, I only had an Omega so <laugh>. Right, right. Couldn't do it. It must have just been banging them out and, and really <span style="color:red" data-ts="2087.985" data-end_ts="2088.205" title="2087.985" id=c_"2087.985">__do__</span> getting it all down in one take. So very nice workflow, <laugh>, just hands on, know, know how to start, know how to stop. Somehow that seems to be a challenge these days, doesn't it? With the modular 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>? Yeah, it does. Well, I mean, just frankly too though, it's also the DW or recording systems of whatever ilk you talk about now, the ability to obsess makes it so that it seems like you have to obsess otherwise you're somehow not doing the work. Right. So like now we're in a point where obsessive editing is just considered part of the game. And it's so interesting to think of. You know, it's, it's funny you mentioned this about going back and, and doing some tapes. I ran across the tape a couple of days ago that, that myself and another collaborator did. It was like one Saturday afternoon we filled up a whole dat tape with stuff and I listened to it. And much like you were talking about, it's like you're listening to it <span style="color:red" data-ts="2143.325" data-end_ts="2143.445" title="2143.325" id=c_"2143.325">__and__</span> it's like, where's the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2144.945" data-end_ts="2145.165" title="2144.945" id=c_"2144.945">__fit__</span> filler or where's the dead tape? And because we were sitting there doing it in real time with these hardware rakes and stuff like that, it wasn't, we were performing the whole time and the tape happened to be rolling Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>And the tape was expensive. The tape was expensive. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2159.805" data-end_ts="2159.965" title="2159.805" id=c_"2159.805">__The__</span> tape 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Expensive. You 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>Bet you didn't, just fill one up and then let's fill another one up. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. That's what we do with hard drives. Now go figure that. Right. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>So yeah, there's a lot that that's, that discipline, seems to have kind of went away with, with the massive storage space that we've got, isn't it? Yeah. I still haven't got anywhere near answering your question, so I'll try and do it as how did I get to chemo? So as you can imagine, it's a very, very long road of, of this stuff and then, releasing. And then as I got less and less active with the releasing and more and more fatigued with the, the way that the really interesting music scene went into the clubs and, and the club culture became monetized and it all became really stinky and bad <span style="color:red" data-ts="2205.645" data-end_ts="2205.845" title="2205.645" id=c_"2205.645">__and__</span> ugly. Yeah. Ugly. And, I, I really ceased to feel like I wanted to soundtrack that anymore. What's what I see in the clubs. I didn't wanna soundtrack it anymore. It's like, why my music doesn't belong there anymore. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>It's not what my music is trying to express. It's not hedonistic, it's not even cathartic. You know, it's like nothing like that <laugh>. Right. There's more going on. So then I've been kind of out of the whole club scene for quite a while, and during that period it was a big relearning and research period and going back to basics and saying, what is it that I'm looking for? What is it that's been driving me all these years? What am I working with? What's the real material I'm working with past the machines and past the technology? And that's where I started to get into signal theory and, some more philosophical aspects of, of what signals are and, and the symbolism of signals. And then lots of interesting stuff, which <span style="color:red" data-ts="2259.645" data-end_ts="2259.765" title="2259.645" id=c_"2259.645">__we__</span> won't go into. But I kind of got back into that. And then I see what I've been working with <span style="color:red" data-ts="2265.345" data-end_ts="2265.565" title="2265.345" id=c_"2265.345">__the__</span>, from a holistic point of view, and then digging right down to the, the constancy, what's always been there. And it's been this manipulating signals using music and exploring the complexity of what happens when you combine and you grow signals, of certain types. And you start to do a sort of special construction of expressive language and which creates, it creates music, you know? And that's something that I, I got to that level of understanding through using the chemo system and studying it quite extensively <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2297.465" data-end_ts="2297.685" title="2297.465" id=c_"2297.465">__Now__</span> the, but the question I have, and, and this is just because of my own experience with people that kind of have made this, this journey, because your journey kind of going from doing like dance type music and then becoming disconnected from that as an environmental thing and then moving towards, maybe a headier more experimental kind of thing or whatever you want to call it. A lot of times there are some events that occur that cause that shift. Right. So in a, a number of cases that I know somebody was just happily going along and, you know, doing dance music and somebody said, Hey, would you score this film? And that put them in a position to think about how they do music differently and it perpetrated a change in the way that they thought about making music. Right? Yeah. Yeah. Did, was there any kind of event like that? Or was it just that you became uncomfortable and you wanted to try something new and the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2357.395" data-end_ts="2357.685" title="2357.395" id=c_"2357.395">__Kima__</span> system seemed to be a platform to do that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>I, I did work. I, I started to work in contemporary dance, scoring, contemporary dance. So, so contemporary dance is, is a very interesting art form because it's closely tied to music and it often has a, a philosophical grounding in, in embodied expressivity and then the embodied intelligence. Right. Right. And when this is combined with, with a certain form of music, music intelligence, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2386.665" data-end_ts="2386.885" title="2386.665" id=c_"2386.665">__so__</span> music and intelligence, you get this beautiful hybrid performative thing, like a stage thing, or they call it contemporary dance, but whether it's more dance or more music, it's difficult to tell. Different pieces are very different. I got into that whole world for a bit, but what, for six years, seven years. And that's where my music started to get free of the need to keep people drinking in the club <laugh>. Right. I don't <span style="color:red" data-ts="2412.845" data-end_ts="2412.925" title="2412.845" id=c_"2412.845">__know__</span>, whatever it <span style="color:red" data-ts="2413.445" data-end_ts="2413.525" title="2413.445" id=c_"2413.445">__was__</span>. They use music for these days. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>Yeah, yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2416.185" data-end_ts="2416.405" title="2416.185" id=c_"2416.185">__Or__</span> keep, keep people, paying for beer, you know, whatever. It was a completely different scenario. And, it meant that I had interesting audiences coming, people who would never come to any of my concerts. They come and sit down and just exposed to, my music design whilst keeping their, their eyes and their visual aspect is entertained by all of the, or is engaged by all of the spatial aspects of the choreography. But then they're also receiving my music and usually very good sound systems, very dynamic. I can be quiet and loud and detailed and intense because the systems are in these theaters, you know, with the, the soft plush in the theaters. Right. <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, not only that, but the audience is quiet. They're not drinking and carrying on conversations and, and trying to dance. I, it's interesting that you say that because to me, I had the, the chance maybe five or six years ago to start working with, some, a contemporary dance company. And I found it amazing because I had never really thought of it as sort of an, an extreme version of the concept of multimedia. Right. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I mean, it is pervasively multimedia because there's these visual things happening. There's these sonic things happening. And it's not only the sounds that I might put on the stage, but also the dancers make sound when they're <laugh> they're performing as well. And so then, you know, that gets encapsulated into a very present feeling. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>Yeah. Yeah. It's a really special laboratory to explore, aesthetics and, and art or the lack of aesthetics, whatever you want to explore, you know? Right. But more than anything, I'd got out of that. I got this, it gave me the chance to experience what my music can do when it's removed from the audience I'd been, I'd been having to work with for 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. The club scene. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>Yeah. The club scene. Like, I don't <span style="color:red" data-ts="2536.045" data-end_ts="2536.125" title="2536.045" id=c_"2536.045">__know__</span> my whole life of touring. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I was never really given any chance to experience my music in any other context. As <span style="color:red" data-ts="2544.445" data-end_ts="2544.605" title="2544.445" id=c_"2544.445">__you__</span>, you mentioned a example of somebody with a film, but this, I didn't have, I still haven't composed for cinema. I haven't worked for cinema. I, I don't know about that. But, definitely in, in dance, that was something there. And I've, I left that also. I left it some, and that's where <span style="color:red" data-ts="2561.805" data-end_ts="2562.045" title="2561.805" id=c_"2561.805">__chemo__</span> got very strong, by the way, during that, the way to design sound in real time whilst the rehearsals are going on, but at a very high quality. 'cause I can't take my entire studio to the theater <laugh>. Right, right. So I had to take, the chemo system is exceptional in, in the way it sounds. And, but it's also quite portable. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>So you get to, explore some really high quality sound, on location. Right. So that's one of the periods where <span style="color:red" data-ts="2590.165" data-end_ts="2590.245" title="2590.165" id=c_"2590.165">__I__</span>, I, I got very deep with it, but then I, I, I think I left contemporary dance also again, perhaps a little frustrated. And guess what? It's because I wanted to get back to the studio. And then I've, I've since realized in the last quite, quite a few years, you know, but that's really where, that's my lab. That's the laboratory where I feel, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2609.965" data-end_ts="2610.205" title="2609.965" id=c_"2609.965">__felt__</span>, I felt most looking. If you, if I look back all the way and I think the experiences that I'm searching for and the moments when, when I've really felt like I just created, I've created a new, a new positive thing for the world, for the universe, for this, this sound, this music, this is, you know, a new invention and it's gonna save the, the world <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>Right. The times I felt that has been in the studio. And so now I'm, I'm very, very into the a the significance of the studio for, for music. I think the recording studio is, is some of the greatest musical, events have happened in studios. And, I think b there's a, studios are under threat and we need to figure out a bit better how, how to make sure that the studio culture continues. And, musicians like myself that can, we can explore stuff in the studio and not on stage in monitors and not under the control of a choreographer or a cinema director. You know, we have to be able to push the music in a studio. That's the place to do it. Sure. So I think that's where I'm at right now. And, ke fits in nicely there as well as the recent renaissance of analog technology, which is, I don't know if that's something you also wanted to talk about. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>We would. But before we go there, I, you used the word you said that the studio is sort of like the laboratory for your work. And I think it's interesting that you use that word because you also, the word lab tends to actually kind of be pervasive through a lot of your work because you also do these things called labs for, the chemo system and for <span style="color:red" data-ts="2722.445" data-end_ts="2722.685" title="2722.445" id=c_"2722.445">__chemo__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>Users. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b><laugh>, I think, yeah. 'cause you know, I've never been to ear <span style="color:red" data-ts="2729.845" data-end_ts="2730.045" title="2729.845" id=c_"2729.845">__cam__</span>. I've never been inside <laugh>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2732.105" data-end_ts="2732.325" title="2732.105" id=c_"2732.105">__Ah__</span>, it's a bit of a fantasy place to me because, my, my professor at university, the, late, Jonathan Harvey, a gr great, composer, he told me about ear cam. He said, yes, they're composers there. They wear lab coats, <laugh>. And, and they go through Airlocks <laugh> to get to their studios to work on music. And I've always had this fantasy image of composers doing serious rocket science type stuff and, <laugh>. So I think perhaps for me it's a little, the lab and the whole, this idea is a bit of a metaphor for, or an analogy for, Hey, I'm serious about music. I've dedicated my entire life to this. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> you know, when, when it's really hard and my band camp is, I'm earning about six euros a month from my band camp and no royalties from anywhere after a lifetime's work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>How am <span style="color:red" data-ts="2786.525" data-end_ts="2786.645" title="2786.525" id=c_"2786.525">__I__</span>, how are you supposed to keep going? Things are really tough. I've got like no bookings and nothing like that. So I think one of the things I fall back on, this year is just like very low <span style="color:red" data-ts="2795.965" data-end_ts="2796.125" title="2795.965" id=c_"2795.965">__in__</span> bookings. A lot of people are suffering from just, I dunno what's going on with the festivals and stuff. They're playing it really safe. So it's really, really hard to, to make a living. And we all know that at the moment. But I think for me, and probably speaking for many others, it <span style="color:red" data-ts="2810.805" data-end_ts="2810.885" title="2810.805" id=c_"2810.805">__was__</span> something I fall back on. It's not that, oh my music's really great entertainment. I fall back on that. This is very serious work that is about progressing and pushing imagination of, of, of music and what we're capable of thinking about and what we're capable of creating. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And it's very continuous creative energy and a continuous creative act. And I take that very, very seriously. So I think perhaps calling things labs and, you know, I, it's, I take it as seriously as those scientists doing medical research or something like that, you know, perhaps that's what it's about. Something to keep you motivated. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Right. I'd, I'd like to take a little side tour here now. 'cause you mentioned something that I think is kind of a, an interesting aspect of what we're seeing right now, which is sort of the reemergence of analog systems. You know, you and I both had this timeframe when we were able to affordably get analog systems. We did a lot of music with them. Right. And then in order to further explore things, we went off and, and really explored sound design in the digital world. But now with the reemergence of modular systems and stuff, there's a really vital place to work Yeah. In analog devices, again. Have, have you jumped into that fairly heavily? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>Yeah. I was a bit late to get back to it. 'cause I felt like I was doing, as you mentioned, I was doing this already before Uhhuh in the mid nineties and early nineties. I've always worked with, with, this type of signal flow with, a subtractive synthesis. So, but I, it, it took me a while to get back into it, but I got into it through, a colleague of mine who, runs thunk in the UK and they're DIY specialist Really? Okay. For Euro <span style="color:red" data-ts="2918.595" data-end_ts="2918.885" title="2918.595" id=c_"2918.595">__Iraq__</span>. Right. And he just sent some kits over to me and said, I think you should start to all these things that I have to put together with a soldiering iron. What the hell is this? You know? But then I got into it and I started to soldiers things together and, and, and it made me look at resistors and transistors and wonder about them. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>What are all these things? And I got <span style="color:red" data-ts="2939.605" data-end_ts="2939.805" title="2939.605" id=c_"2939.605">__to__</span> quite inspired by the, the flavor of the creativity going on in the Euro <span style="color:red" data-ts="2944.805" data-end_ts="2945.205" title="2944.805" id=c_"2944.805">__vaccine__</span>. And there's a lot of interesting creative ways of thinking about the same sort of circuits, you know? Right. And I also like the fact that <span style="color:red" data-ts="2954.365" data-end_ts="2954.565" title="2954.365" id=c_"2954.365">__it__</span>, it's very sonically informed that things, it's about how things sound. And this one, this filter, it's a filter. You know, what's the difference between that filter and the other filter? Right. It's different because, and there'll be some history attached to it, or there'll be some context or some background. And I think in, in techno music and electronic music, 'cause it was, it seemed to have come <span style="color:red" data-ts="2974.645" data-end_ts="2974.805" title="2974.645" id=c_"2974.645">__out__</span> of nowhere, there's quite some warm feelings coming from the fact that things have history, that circuits have a background that they didn't come out of nowhere. That this music has got some kind of lineage and there's lots of narratives in it, and there's narratives being written and created for the future. And I, I quite like that. It's a very warm feeling in, in, in the community what I've experienced. So, that's why I'm quite into it. And I also think the new, designs, the outdated designs of the classics and some of the new approaches sound really, really good. And it's a good, hand in hand with the digital sound world as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So in, in exploring with the electronics, did you ever get the desire to actually go down and design something at the circuit level? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>No, <laugh>. I work, I I do a lot of software, design that's quite low level. I, I like to it, it's taken me a long time to, to find my expression in, in that. Right. So I think to go down to doing, translating that to circuits, I'm not sure what benefits it would bring to me except for the sense of achievement of having done that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Yeah. That makes a lot of sense. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>Yeah. I don't think I would make a, anything that's, that's any more original than what's already out there. So <span style="color:red" data-ts="3052.765" data-end_ts="3052.925" title="3052.765" id=c_"3052.765">__as__</span> it's not, it would more be about the sense of achievement, but I get that sense of achievement just by putting together a DIY kit <laugh> Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and it working. Sure. So, yeah. I, I have thought about that. And if it occurs to me that something would make sense, I would try it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, I, I have to say that just anytime you get to use the soldering iron and you don't burn yourself, you win. Right. <laugh>, <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>I'm quite fast now. I did some <span style="color:red" data-ts="3078.165" data-end_ts="3078.405" title="3078.165" id=c_"3078.165">__surface__</span> mount, components. Oh my God. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3080.395" data-end_ts="3080.685" title="3080.395" id=c_"3080.395">__Yeah__</span>. Alright, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now you went, you entered the crazy zone right there. I'll just tell you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b><laugh>. So I, I used the monocle. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>No doubt you did. So, our time is unfortunately up, but before we go, I want to ask, I know you've got <span style="color:red" data-ts="3097.845" data-end_ts="3097.965" title="3097.845" id=c_"3097.845">__a__</span>, you've got a new piece that's gonna be premiering pretty soon, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>Right. Yeah. So, we started off the conversation talking about spatial sand because I'm just totally madly into it right now, seeing as my, I have a premier coming up in less than, well, three weeks. It's on June the 18th, 19th and 20th in <span style="color:red" data-ts="3116.625" data-end_ts="3116.845" title="3116.625" id=c_"3116.625">__our__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3116.845" data-end_ts="3117.085" title="3116.845" id=c_"3116.845">__horse__</span>, which is the second city of, of Denmark. And they are also the European capital of culture. This, this year. So the, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3126.165" data-end_ts="3126.285" title="3126.165" id=c_"3126.165">__a__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3126.285" data-end_ts="3126.485" title="3126.285" id=c_"3126.285">__host__</span> 2017 Foundation commissioned this work from me, and it's been a great opportunity to explore many of the things we've talked about in this conversation and bring them all into some kind of, new way for staging electronic music, new for me, and probably, a flavor of new for electronic music post post club culture. Right. I've embraced my years working in contemporary dance, bought some of that aspect into the mix. Also, there's the spatial sound, the, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3159.065" data-end_ts="3159.285" title="3159.065" id=c_"3159.065">__the__</span>, the whole spatial spatialization and what this brings, what this brings to an audience, how, how much more active it makes them. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>When an audience is in a spatial sound system, they're more active and engaged than when they're sitting in a cinema or a theater. They have to take it a bit more seriously and engage more than they would in the club. They are necessarily in there to listen. If they talk, they'll miss the point. They have to, you know, put some effort into the being aware of what's of this very special setup and installation. So I bought, tried to get all these elements together and then compose. I've been working for 18 months on a multichannel composition, which is really ex exploring what is hap what's gonna happen to my music? What, how is my music going to change with all these speakers and with all this setting. Right. And I don't want to make any kind of music that I've ever made before. And I wanted to focus very much on sound design. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>So I've used a lot of the, the modular synth that I've been soldiering together. I've used a lot of this for the expression in the sound design, a lot of chemo to help me with some of the ways to distribute signals over in a spatial system. You know, how to take, for example, a spectral resynthesis, how to separate all of the partials and spatialize them and do very interesting things like that. That's, that's definitely the realm of chemo. So I've tried to bring all of my expertise together in this piece. It has, some, staged elements as well as two performers. And it has a kind of narrative setting, which is an old Danish, folk ballad called the Ballad of <span style="color:red" data-ts="3259.885" data-end_ts="3260.285" title="3259.885" id=c_"3259.885">__<inaudible>__</span>. And the Merman, which is about a, a, an old story of, very, very one dimensional of love to loss and love to loss and no other kind of dimensions involved in this story about a citizen of <span style="color:red" data-ts="3275.115" data-end_ts="3275.405" title="3275.115" id=c_"3275.115">__ours__</span> who runs away to live under the sea with a, a creature from below the ocean and has a family under there for under the sea for many years. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>And then she hears the sounds of distant bells and is drawn back to the land and to deserts her life. And, you know, it's a very sad story of, of with no real happy ending. Other composers have tried to work with this story before, and Hans Stein Anderson also tried to stage it and it hasn't really been successfully staged very well. But the reason why composers are drawn to it is because of this sound element that, it's the sound of the bell that <span style="color:red" data-ts="3313.165" data-end_ts="3313.285" title="3313.165" id=c_"3313.165">__r__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3313.305" data-end_ts="3313.525" title="3313.305" id=c_"3313.305">__her__</span> bell that takes her from, takes her back and makes her wanna, gives her the intention to desert again, to desert her life and desert, her family and everything she knows, you know, and I thought these themes somehow have a kind of contemporary resonance and they have a sonic element that's quite interesting. So I found plenty to work with there.

<b>Cristian: </b>I've made quite an abstract version of it. Primarily I'm calling it a spatial sound performance piece because it's also a music concert and it engages on many levels. So it's not a spatial sound concert where you just come in and lie down and trip out. Right? And neither am I interested in that. I'm interested in what happens when we're really engaged of the, and when we're aware that we're participating in a shared experience. Like that's one of the things I love about <span style="color:red" data-ts="3362.625" data-end_ts="3362.845" title="3362.625" id=c_"3362.625">__the__</span> club culture when it's good, right? Is that, that it's an extraordinary experience that you're sharing with all these other people. It has spatial aspects and, and social aspects and very strong musical emphasis. So yeah, that's what the piece is and been working on it, like I said, for a very long time. Now. I'm very excited about the staging. The other exciting part about this, as I mentioned earlier in the conversation, is the sound system. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>I've been really fortunate to be provided with quite a lot of the speakers, by the British speaker manufacturer called Function one mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, which is quite known in the club scene for the amazing sound systems they've put in, many of the club venues in <span style="color:red" data-ts="3402.225" data-end_ts="3402.445" title="3402.225" id=c_"3402.225">__Iha__</span> and in, Heim of course, quite famously. It was quite interesting when they joined the project as the collaborator because, they, at, at first it was difficult for how can we get some of these speakers over? And, and it looked like it wasn't gonna work out. And suddenly I get a call from John at Function One and he's saying, you know what, space is Aha has closed. They've bulldozed it and they're turning it into a car park. So we're getting all our speakers back, so you might be in luck, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh my God, that's amazing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>Yeah. So it was literally, some of these, it was literally post clubbing culture. It's, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3436.185" data-end_ts="3436.405" title="3436.185" id=c_"3436.185">__you__</span> know, what, what I'm trying to do here with music, I'm trying to say electronic music must, must get out of the, the grip of <laugh>, you know, the, the corporate club culture and the stuff that turned it bad. And we must try and evolve into a new, new form. And it's gonna be challenging. It's gonna be challenging for all, for everybody. You're not gonna hear a four <span style="color:red" data-ts="3457.765" data-end_ts="3458.005" title="3457.765" id=c_"3457.765">__four__</span> beat in my composition because four, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3459.965" data-end_ts="3460.205" title="3459.965" id=c_"3459.965">__four__</span> beats in spatial sound doesn't make sense. Right. Why? So anyway, I'm ex, I was already exploring the whole idea of this is I've gotta bring some of the good, the goodness from the history of club culture and try and bring it forward into this new language. And suddenly I get the call that I'm gonna get all the batted speakers from the most commercial club ever. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? Ever. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>So I'm quite excited about <span style="color:red" data-ts="3484.065" data-end_ts="3484.285" title="3484.065" id=c_"3484.065">__you__</span> giving some, giving some soul back to those, amazing speakers and, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Re recycled club culture. That's that's amazing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>Yeah. It's gonna be really, really special thing. So I hope, I hope some, some people can, can travel up to see it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So, to, to, for people who wanna find out more, where's, where can they go to get this? 
</p>

<b>Cristian: </b>Well, there's tickets are on sale now online from the theater, which <span style="color:red" data-ts="3509.185" data-end_ts="3509.405" title="3509.185" id=c_"3509.185">__is__</span>, which we're performing it at, which is called Golds <span style="color:red" data-ts="3512.045" data-end_ts="3512.365" title="3512.045" id=c_"3512.045">__spanning__</span> like, gods G-O-D-S-B-A-N-E-N.

We'll put that in the program notes so that people can, can eyeball. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3526.125" data-end_ts="3526.285" title="3526.125" id=c_"3526.125">__And__</span> I'm actually looking at it right now and I just wanna make sure that we get that information out to people. Cristian, I wanna thank you so much for spending the time. This has been fantastic, to get caught up to hear what you're doing and, and really seeing you push, continue to push yourself, into the unknown realms with, with some of this new work. It's really fabulous to hear and I'm excited to, to just see as your work progresses. Thank you so much for your time and for, for the, the discussion we had. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>Oh, thanks Darwin. It's been really, really great to, to talk about some of this stuff actually. 'cause I don't think everybody, I can't expect that anyone's gonna understand even 80% of what I'm obsessed with at the moment, <laugh>. So I think some of your listeners will, will really appreciate to hear some of this stuff. 'cause I'm sure they're gonna get it, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, I agree. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>So it's, it's really, really special to be able to, to be given a platform to, to talk about some of these ideas. So I appreciate that. Thank you. Alright 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Man, well with that, I'll let you go on with your day. Thank you so much and bye 
</p>

<p>
<b>Cristian: </b>Bye.
