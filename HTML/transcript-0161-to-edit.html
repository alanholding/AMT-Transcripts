<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today I have the great pleasure of getting my first chance to talk to Fabrizio Poche. Is that close? Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Fabrizio Poce: </b>Very 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Good. He is a, max for life device developer whose stuff I stumbled across when I was kind of surfing through Max for live.com. I ran across, some pointers to his work and I really got into it. I got into it because it kind of opens up a certain kind of spectrum of creative work that I always love getting assistance on. So we'll talk more about that when we talk specific about his devices. But in, in the meantime, I wanna say hi to Fabricio. So, hello, how are you today? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Fabrizio: </b>Hi. I am fine, thank you. Thank you for having me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Thank you so much for taking time outta your schedule to, talk to me. You're, you're in Italy, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Fabrizio: </b>I'm not in Italy. You're not Italy? Although I was, I'm born and I lived my very first 24 years of my life in Italy. I live in the Netherlands in Amsterdam. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. I didn't realize that. Very, very cool. Okay, well that, that makes, that makes sense with the times then. 'cause I thought the timing was, the time zones were a little odd, so that makes perfect sense. It's great to have you on board and I appreciate you, you being willing to, to talk to us about this stuff. Let's start off by having you describe a little bit about what J 74 is and what it is that your work is all about. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Fabrizio: </b>J 74 is actually, a sort of nickname I used for producing music and at a certain point for, releasing devices which happen to be maxed for life at this stage. And, well, that's all it is. We can talk about both side of things, the music or the, or the devices, but essentially it's my flag. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. So first let's talk a little bit about your musical releases. What, what kind of work do you do? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Fabrizio: </b>There's two, periods in my life where music has been very, very active and important. The first part was when, I was very young, 15 to probably 25 in that period of my life while I was studying and studying was, for me a very serious thing and a lot a passion in itself. And, and the technicality of engineering of the things I've studied were also part of my passion. But <span style="color:red" data-ts="160.905" data-end_ts="161.125" title="160.905" id=c_"160.905">__at__</span> the passion I cultivated in those years was music, playing with bands and getting serious with bands to a certain level. Of course, if you win the music, you are not really on the, on the major stage. And at that phase I played in several bands, not that many because I got serious with all of them. So some years and producing a few <span style="color:red" data-ts="187.645" data-end_ts="187.765" title="187.645" id=c_"187.645">__a__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="187.765" data-end_ts="187.965" title="187.765" id=c_"187.765">__piece__</span> in, when I was in Italy. Then there was a period in my life, let's say between the 25 and probably the 30 something, something like, eight, nine years where I focused only on the, on other professional stuff, other professional things related to the internet in itself, building the internet, communication, ICT, things like this, which I still do. Okay. And at a certain point, max and live together got me into music again heavily. And I started to discover a completely new world, which took me into a journey I'm still on, and that is where I am now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. So that naturally brings us to talking about J 74, the device creating thing. You have developed quite a number of different devices. Can you kind of walk through the kind of the most important ones? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Fabrizio: </b>Probably an interesting things when you are, when I discuss about my productions in terms of Max <span style="color:red" data-ts="248.405" data-end_ts="248.685" title="248.405" id=c_"248.405">__life__</span> devices, is where actually does, do these device come from? Essentially, I'm, while I'm making music, which is very foundation of all those ideas, while I'm making music, I come short of certain things come short of my own technicalities, come short of time or maybe of life, Amazon life itself. Mm-Hmm. Which is a beautiful environment to make music, which a lot of people of course have discovered, but of course, as its limits. And, when I am such in such situation, I start because I discovered in the meantime that Max is amazingly powerful and very quick I start to develop prototypes. Okay. These prototypes are essentially for myself at the beginning, probably five, six years ago, they were really for myself, but they allowed me to do things I couldn't do without. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Fabrizio: </b>And at a certain point, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="306.605" data-end_ts="306.845" title="306.605" id=c_"306.605">__start__</span>, especially with when other people looked at them. <span style="color:red" data-ts="309.465" data-end_ts="309.685" title="309.465" id=c_"309.465">__No__</span>, I started to evaluate the, the fact that essentially they could be useful for many other people. And that's where it got into well, releasing those devices for a very, low price, because I still want to keep that independent. So I'm not attached to anybody, although I am in good relationship with both Ableton team and <span style="color:red" data-ts="329.075" data-end_ts="329.365" title="329.075" id=c_"329.075">__site__</span> conservative <span style="color:red" data-ts="329.805" data-end_ts="329.965" title="329.805" id=c_"329.805">__for__</span> team, in both mailing, mailing list for developers. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I'm in touch in case of beta releases, et cetera, et cetera. Right. But I still do it on completely on my own. And the devices essentially come from the areas of my interest and the rabbit holes I've been into, because when I go into, I stay for a while. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. I hear you on the rabbit hole because one of my, the the way that I actually ran into your stuff was I wanted for the newsletter for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_%2774">Cycling '74</a> I wanted to write up something about, you know, a current and cool max <span style="color:red" data-ts="365.025" data-end_ts="365.245" title="365.025" id=c_"365.025">__for__</span> live device. And I ran across your devices and I reached out to you and you mentioned, here's one to look at or whatever. And I started getting into the J 74 progressive device. And despite the fact that I had the intention of trying all the devices, I can't because I'm completely obsessed with this one device and all of the different parameters that you've built into it, but also sort of the creative cushion that creates. So for people who don't know, J 74, progressive is a tool that helps you design chord progressions. It's a really great matchup for, you know, you sort of pick a pad or a keyboard sound and you start playing around and you play around with keys and scale types and, progression types. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You've actually, you've, you've gone out on a limb and you've named things you've named progressions to be dreamy or, or whatever. Right. Which I think is, is kind of interesting that you would find a way to classify chord progressions, but you did it in a way that is quite inspirational, but also, which allows you to do things like say, okay, I want to try expanded voicings or whatever. And even if you're not familiar with the terminology necessarily, the, the music theory behind it, it still ends up giving you the opportunity to explore some stuff that otherwise would be really difficult to dig into. Yes. And so as a result, for me, it ended up being a rabbit hole, not from a development standpoint, but from a user standpoint. It became a rabbit hole of I am drawn into trying things and I'm drawn into the idea of experimenting with these voice changes and starting off with one of your predefined, predefined set of chord changes, but then changing them a little bit to fit my current mood. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And it's, you found a way to balance the kind of prescription of here's what's what you do with, here's how you explore. And so that for me is what made it really, I'm, I'm talking too much, but <span style="color:red" data-ts="506.195" data-end_ts="506.485" title="506.195" id=c_"506.195">__that__</span>, that for me is what, is what I kind of blew my head off, and it's why I was so anxious to talk to you about this, because doing that sort of development is not easy. Finding a way to do something that opens doors but doesn't, you know, force you through them is a very savvy kind of development. I'm curious, first of all, what was your, what was the rabbit hole that you were in when you designed this thing? And then what is the progression through development that says, you know, I realized I wanted this, or I talked to somebody and they wanted this. How, how does something as complex as J 74 progressive come about? <span style="color:red" data-ts="551.285" data-end_ts="551.565" title="551.285" id=c_"551.285">__Because__</span> I'm sure at some point it was like, well, I need three chords. Let's make a thing that generates three chords. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Fabrizio: </b>First of all, thanks for the kind words. You could go on an <span style="color:red" data-ts="560.015" data-end_ts="560.365" title="560.015" id=c_"560.015">__alpha__</span> an hour and I will enjoy it. <laugh>, the, the development of progressive, the roots of it start from the fact that I played in a band with a very talented and a very knowledgeable gator guitarist, Alessandro. And I was always trying to follow his discussions on the modes and changing, starting playing in that scale, <span style="color:red" data-ts="582.225" data-end_ts="582.445" title="582.225" id=c_"582.225">__but__</span> play, start from that degree and things I could not follow. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, what, although I had a generic understanding, I'm not a, a composer, trained composer, et cetera, et cetera. And that kind of gap, I had, because there are, were other talents I had drumming, sequencing, step sequencing things, of course completed the band as a whole. But of course, we had a gap with each other. And that was something I always had in mind. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Fabrizio: </b>I want to learn harmony, I want to understand it. And essentially there's a barrier between harmony aficionados, people that really expert and practice years and years, and, electronic musician, they really like to explore, which is time, time, a repetitive study. Harmony, it's difficult because it's a lot. Mm-Hmm, <affirmative>. So essentially what I wanted to create is a canvas for having that knowledge somewhere stored, not in my memory, but in the realm of the computer, and being able to explore it while still using the main concepts in a aware way. So you are aware what you do. You don't need to calculate, you don't need to think, you just be aware what you do and you will explore. And of course, when it started up, it was much simpler than it is today. If you look at the tutorial number one, one I made the, user interface misses really half of the features now where the other half of the feature come from. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Fabrizio: </b>It's a mix of very, very friendly users who mm-Hmm, <affirmative> really, really enjoy what I did, but sold the, the possibilities and gave me a lot of tips. 50% of it probably will never, see the light of day because they're too complex to be implemented. But the other half of it, they went into the software. I'm the kind of person that probably the first five minutes you say, well, it's nice what you do, but you could do that. I'm the <span style="color:red" data-ts="714.805" data-end_ts="714.925" title="714.805" id=c_"714.805">__F__</span> person said, yeah, but it's already complicated <laugh>, I don't want to extend it anymore. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Fabrizio: </b>Right, right. It will break, break down in pieces, then I give it some time. And because I note down everything, I write everything, I keep everything. So I, once in a while I'll open this text file, so emails and I give it a thought, well, maybe I can try and this, maybe I can try. Actually went in all three major releases of the software and got in a lot of more feature, a lot of more possibilities, which lets you mix up, things, trying things on the fly with <span style="color:red" data-ts="750.165" data-end_ts="750.325" title="750.165" id=c_"750.165">__the__</span> live mode and building progression at, with a much more complex number of variations, all things you can do on top of it. And now it's become quite a complex software. I don't want to touch it anymore, <laugh>, it's still complex now. It's, it's still complex, but it's still quite the same as the first version. So it's a statement of its reliability, let's say. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I, I guess you're right that it is complex, but it's complex in a, in a way that, where you don't have to, you don't have to attack all of the complexity at once, right? No, yeah. You segment things into little sub screens, which helps. But also there's just sort of, the defaults tend to work. And when you start off with just a key and a chord progression, it'll do something fun. And then now it gives you the opportunity to explore some of the other menus or some of the other settings you can play around and see if you like it or not. And it's, it's a very entertaining system from that standpoint. So that's, it's, it's cool. Now you said that a lot of this kind of started from working with this guitarist. So any software has to have, has to show some opinions, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And you're opinionated in this software by having names for things, by picking certain modes that you, you know, you kind of highlight. But also things like how long the sequence lanes are or when you do open voicings, what those voicings look like. How much of those decisions were based on some of those initial concepts that you, that you caught from this guitarist? How many things came from later study? I mean, did you have to go back to the books and kind of relearn harmony yourself? Or did you already have enough of that in your, in your system that you could depend on your internal voice? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Fabrizio: </b>After playing with Alessandra and composing music with Alessandro for many years, a lot of that experiences, those experiences were my baseline for starting making a software. So the very baseline of the software, it's there from the beginning and things we were doing together are there from the beginning, which is a certain alternative indie pop culture we had. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So progression in itself is part of the western pop culture. Right. And that was there from the beginning. And then of course I started to dig down some areas. I knew the of existence. I had a couple of tries on, for instance, change morphing one progression in a, in a, in, in a key into another progression in one of the neighbor keys. Okay. Model and model changes as well. And those things I was aware of, I had a certain understanding, but before you make something which is useful and can go in territory into territories, I never explored myself. I need to structure them in a certain way and I needed to, to, to dig into the, the, the logics of the books and the theory. Sure, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Got it. So now it's clear just from my gushing that I got pretty obsessed already with the J 74, progressive software. But you have many other, many other packages if I, yeah. So there's a base, a baseline one. What is, is that like 
</p>

<p>
<b>Fabrizio: </b>A, it's a, it's, it's a, let's say the nephew of JT <span style="color:red" data-ts="972.605" data-end_ts="972.765" title="972.605" id=c_"972.605">__of__</span> pro progressive. Essentially, when I made, what was probably version two of progressive, it was already quite complex and capable that I really started to compose music myself. And probably a lot of people do it, compose sketches of songs that way. Mm-Hmm. And of course, you start to <span style="color:red" data-ts="994.305" data-end_ts="994.525" title="994.305" id=c_"994.305">__run__</span> a bass line when you pick up the keyboards or your, I don't <span style="color:red" data-ts="997.925" data-end_ts="998.045" title="997.925" id=c_"997.925">__know__</span>, your push and you start to play a bass bass line on this, probably in the first place in <span style="color:red" data-ts="1003.385" data-end_ts="1003.605" title="1003.385" id=c_"1003.385">__Key__</span>. And then <span style="color:red" data-ts="1004.205" data-end_ts="1004.365" title="1004.205" id=c_"1004.205">__at__</span> a certain point I thought, well, actually, sometimes I want to sequence that baseline not playing myself because I want some, some slides, I want some accents. I I want something. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And then I started to think, well, actually I could mix them up. And it's essentially what I did with baseline, which is essentially the logic of progressive <span style="color:red" data-ts="1025.355" data-end_ts="1025.645" title="1025.355" id=c_"1025.355">__with__</span> all the knowledge of the harmony and a few <span style="color:red" data-ts="1027.965" data-end_ts="1028.325" title="1027.965" id=c_"1027.965">__concert__</span>, if you're a best player, you know, like leading notes and using another, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1034.465" data-end_ts="1034.685" title="1034.465" id=c_"1034.465">__or__</span> the root note on wild court changes, things like this. And I, mix them up with real sequencing. So you are talking about now of, 16 steps, et cetera, et cetera. And so it's a more or less a step sequencer with a lot of harmony around it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Got it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Fabrizio: </b>So that was quite natural. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, the other devices are, as I mentioned the beginning come from some edges I found in software <span style="color:red" data-ts="1065.585" data-end_ts="1065.805" title="1065.585" id=c_"1065.585">__or__</span> my abilities. So for instance, I am addicted to work <span style="color:red" data-ts="1068.925" data-end_ts="1069.125" title="1068.925" id=c_"1068.925">__od__</span> I really love them. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1071.135" data-end_ts="1071.485" title="1071.135" id=c_"1071.135">__Right__</span>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1072.685" data-end_ts="1072.845" title="1072.685" id=c_"1072.685">__OD__</span> and harmonizers. And, and so I, I wanted to build a VCO myself and actually, I started looking at a vco and then I made an harmonizer, and then I mixed up an harmonizer with a vco. And that product I've evolved for a while until, I picked it up and tried to make it a device I could release and I did it. And that became, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1098.285" data-end_ts="1098.805" title="1098.285" id=c_"1098.285">__JJ__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1098.805" data-end_ts="1099.365" title="1098.805" id=c_"1098.805">__54__</span> pitch control. Okay. Which I'm quite fond of, essentially because it's produces really good stuff. And also it really shows up the quality of what Max can do. Andre really bring something new into the Theon <span style="color:red" data-ts="1114.965" data-end_ts="1115.205" title="1114.965" id=c_"1114.965">__live__</span> tool <span style="color:red" data-ts="1115.925" data-end_ts="1116.165" title="1115.925" id=c_"1115.925">__that__</span> you, you have. And then there are also other devices. I made experiments, which got into devices like morphing stuff, which is interpolation of parameters. Right. Which started as an impossible task. And then I found a way to do it, which is, efficient. And there, there are also a few sequencing real sequencers or modulation devices, which I, I do with my own angle, which is still a mix of harmony sequencing and a few variation in, I dunno, step number or, probability things, which add some evolution to the things you do. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>One, one of 'em I'm particularly curious about is the J 74 step locker. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1166.635" data-end_ts="1166.925" title="1166.635" id=c_"1166.635">__Yeah__</span>. Which, which is, kind of based on your twist on parameter locking, which, you know, I, like many people first got clued into by electrons, work with like the Octa <span style="color:red" data-ts="1178.045" data-end_ts="1178.245" title="1178.045" id=c_"1178.045">__track__</span> and Yeah. And some of their devices. Was that the inspiration for you as well? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Fabrizio: </b>I regret to say yes. <laugh>. Okay. It was the inspiration. Sure. Well, essentially, I, I love the electron stuff. Uhhuh, <affirmative>, I mean, if it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1191.085" data-end_ts="1191.205" title="1191.085" id=c_"1191.085">__a__</span> hardware somebody should buy, then buy electron stuff, <laugh>, because the passion and, ingenuity and the precision they turn into their hardware is just amazing. Right. And parameter locking is something you could do in life very simply. You, create a clip and then you do some clip automation that you have it, but interface for doing it, it's the mouse, it's, or if, if you have push, you can do it a little bit. But it's, this doesn't really work that way. And, that, that interface for me was, the starting point for making the device. Essentially, I designed the interface first. It was one of the only devices I made, top down Uhhuh, <affirmative>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1236.405" data-end_ts="1236.725" title="1236.405" id=c_"1236.405">__maybe__</span> the user interface. And they're starting to solve problems. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see. It's clear that, you know, regardless of how you design the, the product, the interface and how you attack the parameters is something that's really important to you. Yeah. Now, you said that, a certain segment of your life was dedicated to working on the web and doing development in that area. What, what kind of work were you doing and how did you use that to inform your, your development of musical devices? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Fabrizio: </b>Well, technology as a starting point is one of the foundation <span style="color:red" data-ts="1277.905" data-end_ts="1278.125" title="1277.905" id=c_"1277.905">__by__</span> the pillars of my own life. So I'm somebody that likes technology and likes to use technology. I'm not afraid of it in any form. And, the internet, which in my personal professional career as an ICT person, was rather software integration, hardware integration than making software itself. I was also making software, but it was not my core activity really gave me structure. Structure and, and a way to attack problems, which is divide and conquer, which is top down if you can, as much as you can, reuse of parts, things that really are helpful, when you solve any problem. And when you have a musical inspiration, which has some boundary you want to break, which is a problem, you can tackle it that way. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, that's the way I do it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Fabrizio: </b>An engineer. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Yes. An engineer. <laugh>. So I'm always curious, and, and this comes up a lot in when I talk to people who are sort of in the making thing, which is how do you balance being an engineer with being an artist? 'cause you've, you know, you've been both sides of that as have a number of people, but everybody seems to have a different take on how they do it. How do you balance being an engineer with still needing to make creative tools? Or conversely, how do you allow yourself to be creative but still have the rigorous approach that engineering would provide? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Fabrizio: </b>In my specific case, it was really one or the other in periods of my life. So when I was studying, I was studying seriously, but of course, making music, I learned a lot of music. I wasn't, I was not studying music. I was studying technology. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, but music was really 50% of my time. Then I started, let's say a serious life. And I got away from music, but music was still, something I did on a day basis when I got time. So I never stopped really, but never, I stopped producing music and playing music with bands on a serious way. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1415.745" data-end_ts="1415.965" title="1415.745" id=c_"1415.745">__And__</span> so in one part of my life, music was really taking as much time as I could and trying to make possibly even a living of it. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1425.345" data-end_ts="1425.565" title="1425.345" id=c_"1425.345">__At__</span>, at the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1426.085" data-end_ts="1426.205" title="1426.085" id=c_"1426.085">__a__</span> at, at a certain point, I shifted in music is a hobby. The third phase of my life, which I'm, today I'm trying to essentially mix the professional life with making tools for music and making music is now for me and a way of producing ideas. It's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1446.625" data-end_ts="1446.845" title="1446.625" id=c_"1446.625">__bit__</span> strange. But now I'm not, I'm not <span style="color:red" data-ts="1449.225" data-end_ts="1449.445" title="1449.225" id=c_"1449.225">__na__</span> an artist anymore as my main activity being an artist. It's just, for me, a channel for getting ideas into something else. Sometimes I make just music. It's very simple, but I don't <span style="color:red" data-ts="1465.565" data-end_ts="1465.805" title="1465.565" id=c_"1465.565">__leave__</span> my, my income does not come from music anymore. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. Now, do you find that kind of freeing, does it allow you to be either more experimental in your music or more exp expense experimental in the devices you create because there's not a requirement for you to necessarily have to match up to other people's sense of what you should get paid for? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Fabrizio: </b>Yes, for sure. For sure. Although I think I could probably do some something in some area of music production and do it seriously, there's really no need for it. And I'm completely free to do whatever I want. And this of course frees you from any responsibility. So from the music point of view, I just pick up the bass or pick up the keyboard or start some sequencing or use one of my tool because I just like to, sure. There's nothing I need, I must produce. So of course, this frees me up. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm curious about your, your decision to focus on Max for live. Why did you choose Max <span style="color:red" data-ts="1529.885" data-end_ts="1530.085" title="1529.885" id=c_"1529.885">__for__</span> live? Was it because you were able <span style="color:red" data-ts="1532.485" data-end_ts="1532.645" title="1532.485" id=c_"1532.485">__and__</span> live user and that was the easiest tool to do? Or is it that you happened to try the max language and you liked it? Or was there something else that drew you in that direction? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Fabrizio: </b>The process was about 2007. I started to look at <span style="color:red" data-ts="1550.535" data-end_ts="1550.885" title="1550.535" id=c_"1550.535">__Apple__</span> Live, Uhhuh, <affirmative>. I was not aware of either Appleton Live or Max before that. Okay. And in those years, 2007, 2008, I started to make music again on a very, very, almost daily basis. And I started to look around for tools. And one of the tools I started, using was Max and probably was 2009, if I remember, of 2010. You guys ended up in a, in a beautiful partnership, which is Max for life as it is today. And at that time, really, you freed me up, I could do things in my own dough, which it's, it's a dream probably for every <span style="color:red" data-ts="1597.335" data-end_ts="1597.685" title="1597.335" id=c_"1597.335">__geeky__</span> producer around. And, really I could start to do things I was dreaming of. 'cause of course, if you rely on a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1607.285" data-end_ts="1607.565" title="1607.285" id=c_"1607.285">__doll__</span>, then you rely on a team of developers, which does its own research for features and which is not designed by you, and it's designed for many people. Right. But when you, you are the unique person, that can decide features for a device, part of a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1626.525" data-end_ts="1626.645" title="1626.525" id=c_"1626.525">__d__</span> fully integrated, well, it's a dream. And I think you are really made something which is useful and funny to use and extremely powerful and quick. Of course, there are quick quirks because it's software within software, it'll, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1641.515" data-end_ts="1641.805" title="1641.515" id=c_"1641.515">__with__</span> quite some overread it can be shaky at times, but the things it can do are definitely worth it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, so now I could let you talk for an hour and be completely happy with what you said to me. So thank you. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1656.355" data-end_ts="1656.645" title="1656.355" id=c_"1656.355">__Yeah__</span>. <laugh>. Now, my question for you though then is do you, I mean, you mentioned that there are some places where it feels like, you know, you can kind of sense that it is, it's several layers in. Do you ever like long to either get into c plus plus plugin development or some other kind of thing that might, you know, maybe improve performance? Or, or are you happy with the level of abstraction that comes with working in Max? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Fabrizio: </b>I gave some thoughts. I even started the journey of porting, some devices. But the pleasure and the quick and the very extremely short time between an idea and an implementation we can get in max, it's not, cannot be matched by the performance gain, especially if you think about it in long <span style="color:red" data-ts="1717.125" data-end_ts="1717.285" title="1717.125" id=c_"1717.125">__term__</span>. We have more and more computing power to our disposal, really trying to optimize performance as one of the main goals of making software. It becomes less and less important at the end. You want to produce music, at least as a user, right. So if the tool you use is reliable and can get you results, if it uses 15% of your CPU or use 8%, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1749.715" data-end_ts="1749.935" title="1749.715" id=c_"1749.715">__you__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1750.115" data-end_ts="1750.335" title="1750.115" id=c_"1750.115">__or__</span>, of your CPU does not really matter. Right. So in most of the time, I'm perfectly fine with Maxwell Life. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now you actually said something there that I'm curious about, which is, when you make music as a user, how difficult is it for you to sit down with the intention to make music? How, how difficult is it not to get drawn into the technical side? Because for myself, I find that it's really easy to go from artistic mode to jump into something technical, but it's almost impossible then to go from something technical back into an artistic mood. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Fabrizio: </b>Yeah. I think it's personal. Yeah. In my case, it's something's I, I really get carry carried on by the thing I'm doing. And I'm, when I said at the beginning, a rabbit hole, <laugh>, it's really, it's really me. Okay. When I'm doing something and I get attracted by one detail, maybe music Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, then you probably can call me on the phone, can be beside me and talk to me. I won't listen. <laugh>, I'm just doing that. Okay. And, when I'm doing music, I'm doing music. When I, when I start to make a track, a track, then I'm really making that track. Sure. And it probably gonna take me one day, two days, three days, four days, and I'm doing that till I'm finished. And that's also one thing. It's really peculiar of myself. I get things finished. It's one of the things I always do. When I start something, I finish it or I abandon it after a good thought. If it's not good enough, it's Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> start to bo to, to annoy me, et cetera, then I stop with it. But normally I finish it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So I'm, I'm curious about that though, because one of the things that is sort of a hallmark for, some of the best musicians is that, is this sense of being careful when the editor is let in the door. Right? So sometimes what you want is you want to produce things without worrying about whether they're good or not. But then at some point you have to come in and say, this is good enough to pursue. Or this is, this was truly a rabbit hole and it's going to lead nowhere, so I need to abandon it. Which is easier for you. Is it easier for you to do things or is it easier for you to edit? And how do you prevent the other side from taking over? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Fabrizio: </b>Ah, that's a difficult one. First of all, the process of making music is, for me very enjoyable. That's starting point. So when I start to be creative, I sh I, I just let it go. So, and normally I can get, something which I like for me, and it's maybe 70% finished, not mixed, not mustard, but finished from a musical point of view very quickly. Mm-Hmm. One day, maybe, just especially since I'm working alone last years, it's very difficult for me, to say, well, I get disturbed. I don't get disturbed. I'm alone, and I don't get carry on on, oh, now I, I need to put the compressor really tied on this, on this drum. I'll do it later on. Right now I need to get the, the kick where I want it to be <laugh>. Right. That's the most important thing, not compressor. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Fabrizio: </b>Sure. And then there is a point when I say, well, it's 80% fine, maybe it's a bit repetitive. Maybe there are not enough variations, but the concept is there. And then I do the recognition work. It's like architect, it's like making a sculpture, you know? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you can see the shape at a very early stage. You, because in your head there's the finished product of a concept of the finished product. Then you start to a certain point, well, it's okay, I won't have any more detail. At this stage <span style="color:red" data-ts="1991.245" data-end_ts="1991.365" title="1991.245" id=c_"1991.245">__I__</span> start to finish some parts and that's the way I work. So there's more or less a little time where the two overlap, but it's not much. So at a certain point, it's finished and I get the truck mixed and, and I'm in engineering mode. And just finish the technicalities of things. And I think I can manage it. Probably I enjoy more the first part. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> because more creative, of course. Sure. And the second part can be at times, maybe I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2021.445" data-end_ts="2021.645" title="2021.445" id=c_"2021.445">__work__</span> too long, I mix for too long, and then I start to make wrong decision the day after. I start to, to shout myself, what the, did you do on this? And, but again, it's part I, everybody that does this knows it. Right. And so probably the first part is definitely more enjoyable. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, one of the things we kind of jumped over or we started talking about it, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2045.205" data-end_ts="2045.325" title="2045.205" id=c_"2045.205">__I__</span> kind of got diverted because I'm just fascinated by your process and you seem to be like really thoughtful and, and really self-aware about how you do the things you do. I'm kind of curious about your background, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2059.705" data-end_ts="2059.925" title="2059.705" id=c_"2059.705">__you__</span>, how you grew up and how you, how you got involved in music and how you got involved in software development. You know, when each of those became part of your life, but also, you know, as you came to mix and match them where, where you were at personally. Can you tell me a little bit about your background story? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Fabrizio: </b>Yeah, of course, of course. I grew up in Italy, where I studied <span style="color:red" data-ts="2083.305" data-end_ts="2083.525" title="2083.305" id=c_"2083.305">__at__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2083.525" data-end_ts="2083.765" title="2083.525" id=c_"2083.525">__France__</span>, made music in my family. There was a little music in the way that was a, a keyboard. And my father used to play it for, for pleasure. And so I had a keyboard there so I could play the, the white and the, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2098.645" data-end_ts="2098.805" title="2098.645" id=c_"2098.645">__and__</span> the black keys and hear the difference. I was not trained musically. And, and at school I start to make friends, with people that really love music. So this guiding light line in my life was already there from very early stage. And with those guys, or, and a girl, I started to make music. And, that was first. So music came first. There was no software. But I, I also a person fascinated by mathematics, by logics of things, by how things influence each charter if you do a certain process. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Fabrizio: </b>So technicalities. And when I started to, to, to dig into them, especially at university, I started to find the, the, the, the relationships in things. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> music is not only creativity, improvisation, no, no. Music is also mathematics. Relationships between frequencies. It's the sound of a synthesizer, if you use <span style="color:red" data-ts="2160.845" data-end_ts="2160.965" title="2160.845" id=c_"2160.845">__a__</span>, an envelope is how the spectrum moves in time, which fascinates people. So there is a lot of physicality and math, mathematics into music. And of course going to the next step, which is software. It's quite natural because then you can have a computing machine do things which a human probably could not do or not do in that way and do it for you, which is also very fascinating. And I think that when, when you got the tools in your hands, then it's a shame if you don't mix them up. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. As you started getting all of these things mixed in together, what was the first, what was the first computer that was capable of that you were, that was capable of being used to make music? What's the first one that you used? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Fabrizio: </b>Probably due to my age, it was the Omega. Okay. The com Commodore Omega. Right. Which I still, have a sort of, kind of, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2220.305" data-end_ts="2220.525" title="2220.305" id=c_"2220.305">__oh__</span>, that was what I used when I was young. Uhhuh <affirmative>. And I love it. And I love it. So that was the platform I used to to, to do very first sequencing with the trackers and and some sampling. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I was gonna say that Amigo was really a platform for trackers. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2237.155" data-end_ts="2237.445" title="2237.155" id=c_"2237.155">__Yeah__</span>. Which a lot of people who start off on trackers kind of go down that rabbit hole and never really start working with other sequencers. They stick with tracker style things forever, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Fabrizio: </b>Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. But probably because of the people I was surrounded. Ah, okay. About, so especially in Italy, there's not a huge, there a lot of good electronic musicians, but the majority of the musician probably, because normally apart from the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2269.285" data-end_ts="2269.725" title="2269.285" id=c_"2269.285">__EDM__</span> of these days, probably electronic musician is a bit dark in general. Right. There's not that much of dark music love in, in Italy. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So there was not a lot of people who were into the electronic instruments. So I was surrounded by <span style="color:red" data-ts="2283.305" data-end_ts="2283.525" title="2283.305" id=c_"2283.305">__GI__</span> guitarist or bass players and well, it gets into, into as well. So I'm not a purist, I never was a purist. So if I have, beside me in my, in my own studio, I have six guitars, which I can decently play. And which are really instruments I pick up very often because I love them too. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Fabrizio: </b>Right, right. So the tracker was the tool I had, but when I got some money, et et cetera, I started to <span style="color:red" data-ts="2314.805" data-end_ts="2314.885" title="2314.805" id=c_"2314.805">__do__</span> with, to work with sequencers, hardware sequencers. Mm-Hmm. And I discovered synthesizers because I was, lucky enough to buy for nothing. Roland Juno, 1 0 6. Oh, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2328.045" data-end_ts="2328.245" title="2328.045" id=c_"2328.045">__right__</span>. Which I still have. Which I still have. And I still love, even if it's a simple synthesizer, it's it's own character and warmth. It's really something, something that machine has. I enjoyed my time on trackers, but I never went the hard way into, I dunno, making the early kind of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2347.875" data-end_ts="2348.485" title="2347.875" id=c_"2347.875">__technical__</span> stuff, strange's technical stuff. I never, I went, I'm not really into techno music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, the other thing though, coming from an Amiga background, amiga was really at the forefront of visuals. You know, whether it was video editing and video manipulation or even modeling and some of those things. Did you ever play around with that or was that just never of interest to you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Fabrizio: </b>In those years I was not really making visual things, although I'm a visual person and I can pick up a, a pencil and draw, although I'm not an, an extremely good, painter or something. I did some mm-Hmm. <affirmative> because I also like it. I never, used computers at that time when I had an Omega for visuals. On the other end, visuals is something I, I really love, I like and do. And I also made a plugin set, in max life using essentially all the jitter functionalities in, in max in a module way into life. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I also made, for a period, I, I, I was also doing festivals. I did quite some festivals actually. Just doing visuals, real time with my own tools. Uhhuh <affirmative>. Yeah. It's something I really, I really like. And if you look on my YouTube page, you will see there's a lot of things done vi visually in Max, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2432.415" data-end_ts="2432.765" title="2432.415" id=c_"2432.415">__which__</span> was essentially, based on my tool, which, which is Max. Yeah. That's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2436.725" data-end_ts="2436.845" title="2436.725" id=c_"2436.725">__a__</span>, a lot of relationship in my head between what I hear and what I see. And I want what I hear, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2442.725" data-end_ts="2442.845" title="2442.725" id=c_"2442.725">__I__</span> produce as a musician, sometimes I want to produce as a visual. There's a strong relationship between the two. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>One of the things I've noticed is that if you're willing to do visuals, there are a lot of musicians that want you to work with them. And two visuals where sometimes as a musician, there's so many musicians, it's harder to get collaborations. Have you found that for yourself or do you feel like it's equally available to you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Fabrizio: </b>No, it's different. Definitely there are, the number of people doing visuals, especially with computers, is really, really small. Right. And it's a really small community. I've done a few festivals, LPM for instance, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2486.165" data-end_ts="2486.405" title="2486.165" id=c_"2486.165">__nearly__</span> three times. And really that community's really tiny Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> confronted with what you, the levels even of professionality that you, that you have in, in music world. It's not matched by the video, realtime video visuals. While also there is also part I want to mention. For me, visuals most of the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2508.885" data-end_ts="2509.045" title="2508.885" id=c_"2508.885">__time__</span> means generative. I really dislike people playing with video loops. Right. 'cause for me, it's, it's something far too simple and, and, and far too boring and repetitive. I dunno, I never, I never <span style="color:red" data-ts="2523.185" data-end_ts="2523.405" title="2523.185" id=c_"2523.185">__was__</span> into that thing, that kind of thing. Interesting. So for me, visuals, for me, it's really more into s sculpting, something on a screen that you would probably, if you could do it in, with laser lights, like, Mr. Hanker or even sculptures if you could. But visuals, it's a way to express yourself. And video loops are not. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Sure. That sounds interesting. And it seems like you have your hands full with a lot of different things to do. I'm curious now, how much interaction do you have with the users of your software? Do do generally people reach out and talk to you about your devices or about, you know, the, the work you're doing? Or how much feedback do you get? I'm kind of curious what that, what that's like for a, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2569.005" data-end_ts="2569.125" title="2569.005" id=c_"2569.005">__a__</span> max for <span style="color:red" data-ts="2569.565" data-end_ts="2569.725" title="2569.565" id=c_"2569.565">__life__</span> device creator. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Fabrizio: </b>First of all, first of all, I think, I normally don't like to talk about this, but I think that's a really important because the prices are so fair. I think I have a fair price for what I produce. It's really low. People have normally start with a, with a sort of relaxed approach to them and they start to discover the depth and the passion I put into them. So they really positive. So all the, the people I, they reach to me, they start with, they start with positive approach, which for me is fundamental because it sets really a mood in after three years plus of doing this. I have a tendency to when the a minimal comes that Oh yeah, let's look what they say. And it's, look, if there is an idea, I'm positive me as well. It's really a few people with problems. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Fabrizio: </b>If there are problems, it's probably because there is a system with a specific interface or a specific, CPU or there's a, a tiny change being being done in a max or either live version. Normally things, especially in the last versions of both don't break anymore, which is very good. So the relationship's quite positive. There's a lot of feedback in the way then people start to suggest things. And which is really extremely good thing for a developer because if you, you don't need to do them all in once. Just note them down, make a wish, wishlist, go through things, pick up the quick wins. You can really improve your own software if that software can be improved. 'cause of course, if you miss spaghetti, it's difficult to get after three months into the spaghetti again, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Fabrizio: </b>I tend to be quite structured in what I do. So it's, I'm, I'm, I'm really happy with the kind of relation I have with the people, giving feedback because it's essentially very constructive. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Given all that, what does the future look like for you? What kind of things do you have in the laboratory right now that you're working on? What areas of your current releases are you looking at, extending maybe what kind of music do you have that, that you're going to be pushing forward? What are the things that are that the future for you now? 
</p>

<b>Fabrizio: </b>Well, there is nothing in at the stage of being a prototype for release. So there are, although <span style="color:red" data-ts="2713.765" data-end_ts="2714.165" title="2713.765" id=c_"2713.765">__though__</span>, a few things I have in the prototype for myself face Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and there's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2721.725" data-end_ts="2721.845" title="2721.725" id=c_"2721.725">__a__</span>, a technique I use myself in cutting drum loops normally played by a real drummer and for doing complex re drumming of things. A sort of bit repeating but really not fancy to the dance floor. Which I really have developed myself an empiric technique which I would like to translate into a device. And I have already some prototype which can mimic myself a bit, but not good enough. So that's one, rabbit hole to get to go into <laugh>. I love it. I love the word. Yeah. And the video plugins I made, which are totally, totally customizable. You can explore whatever you want, but they are really too complex to be used by normal producer, which does not have hours in testing and learning.

<b>Fabrizio: </b>So <span style="color:red" data-ts="2773.905" data-end_ts="2774.125" title="2773.905" id=c_"2773.905">__not__</span> trying to make some good things which are generative visuals in a creative way when you could as a user, not only reuse them but really change them, shape them visually in a good way. But it's still again, a prototype for myself stage. Sure. And I'm doing, and I'm doing quite interesting stuff on Arduino as well, which is <span style="color:red" data-ts="2797.245" data-end_ts="2797.445" title="2797.245" id=c_"2797.245">__not__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2797.495" data-end_ts="2797.845" title="2797.495" id=c_"2797.495">__Marks__</span>, but things I could probably do something especially, well I used to test them with little bits Arduino with my little bits. My kids love them as well. Yes. Yeah. And yeah, there's a few severe utilities, LFOs int intelligence things which divide your playing into, an outswing and I should publish them probably and not even sell them, but I need to find the channel <span style="color:red" data-ts="2826.985" data-end_ts="2827.205" title="2826.985" id=c_"2826.985">__on__</span> a way to do it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Right on. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Fabrizio: </b>As you can see, there's really, I need to make more music. So more ideas will come. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2835.625" data-end_ts="2836.045" title="2835.625" id=c_"2835.625">__Vibrio__</span>, I want to thank you so much for taking time outta your schedule to have a chat. Let's give people a chance to look over your stuff. Your website is, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Fabrizio: </b>My website is with my name, so it's www.fabriziopoche.com. Fabrizio poche is my name. So if you google it on the web, you should be able to find it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. I'll make sure that it's in the show notes as well. 'cause you, in addition to your, your devices, you also have links to your music on SoundCloud and stuff too, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Fabrizio: </b>Yes. There're also, yeah, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2870.685" data-end_ts="2870.845" title="2870.685" id=c_"2870.685">__but__</span> you can find me also on Spotify, iTunes, because IF pro I produce them. Although I probably could not probably for sure could not live of it. But I, I still make music, in a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2884.165" data-end_ts="2884.325" title="2884.165" id=c_"2884.165">__serious__</span> way. So you can also listen to that if you wish. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Fantastic. Well, thank you so much Fabrizio, for your time. I really appreciate it and have a great day. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Fabrizio: </b>Me too. Appreciated your, your time. Thank you. All 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Bye. Many thanks to Fabricio for taking the time to have the discussion. If you haven't had a chance to check out his work, you really need to take a look at the J 74 work. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2910.915" data-end_ts="2911.205" title="2910.915" id=c_"2910.915">__Just__</span> doing some stuff that's kind of non-obvious, kind of fits a really nice spot. Anyway, thanks to him for having the interview. Thanks for you listening. I appreciate that. And, we'll keep on banging 'em out next week. Bye.
