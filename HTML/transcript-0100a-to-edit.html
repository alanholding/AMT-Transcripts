<b>Darwin: </b>This is part one of a two <span style="color:red" data-ts="8.805" data-end_ts="9.085" title="8.805" id=c_"8.805">__part__</span> interview with me, Darwin Gross. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory Taylor: </b>Hi. Welcome to the Art Plus Music Plus Technology Podcast. Darwin can't come to the phone right now, so you may have noticed things are a little bit different, and here's why. This is the 100th Art plus Music plus Technology podcast. It's a special event, and since it's a special event, and Darwin can't be here right now because he's on the other end of the interviewing pipeline, my name is Greg. I've been a guest on the show once or twice before. Had a great time. And this time for the hundredth podcast, we're going to be talking to Darwin Gross. And as is always the case, for those of you who are regular listeners to the podcast, you know what the first question is gonna be some version of, tell me a little bit about how you got here, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Well, thanks a lot Gregory, for, inviting me onto my podcast. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b><laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You kind of cornered me on this one, and I, I didn't have a good way to say no, so I just decided to go with it. It is, it is kind of a, an appropriate thing for the hundredth podcast because my, my purpose in doing the podcast was actually kind of twofold. One, it was to, to get a chance to talk to some people that I wanted to talk to. But there was actually kind of a, a deeper goal in mind, which is kind of really personal, which is that I, I really hate my own voice. And so, I decided that I would try and do something that would be really low key and that nobody would actually care about that much, that, would force me to use my voice, right. Force me to get in front of the microphone or whatever. And so, there you go. What's surprising is thanks to a lot of people, you know, certainly the people that I interviewed, certainly people like, the folks at opia who helped spread the word of the podcast and stuff, a whole lot more people listen to my voice every week than I ever would've expected. And so, to me, it's kind of funny that now probably one the thing that I am, you know, most widely known for is a product of my voice, which is the thing that I just absolutely have always feared my whole life. So, there you go. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Well, that seems, that seems fair. And just in a kind of an odd karmic sort of way, in some respects, one of the things that's really interesting about your podcast is that we have a chance to talk to people who we know by, other means, right? Or other work. Right. And, and the seems to me that the best interviews you've been able to get or when your interviews are really just great. One of the things that we come away with knowing is we know something about the person that did the work that we encounter. Sure. And it seems really fair, really fair for a hundredth one that we should talk a little bit about that for you. So I understand your reticence, and I also think that, I think that people know more about you in a way than you think they do, because in fact, it's very difficult to have spent 99 hours talking to people and asking them questions. And especially the way that you do interviews where there's only one question that starts the interview, and after that it goes somewhere else. It's really difficult to listen to a whole lot of these in a row and not to begin to get a sense of what strikes you as curious or also the reason for wanting to talk to somebody. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, it's, it's interesting because I, over the time that I've been doing the podcast, I've had a lot of requests for some sort of interview with me, and I always, I've always kind of pushed back saying, you know, I kind of sprinkle in a little bit of my story into every podcast. But also, you know, each person I talk to, I talk to like once or twice, and, but you hear me every single time. So <laugh>, I'm thinking that maybe people are hearing enough from my voice already, but, apparently not. 'cause 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Well, maybe one of, maybe one of the things about that though, is that your follow-up questions or your interviews with people are driven by their answers. So in a sense, you know, I guess what we could have done is <span style="color:red" data-ts="283.925" data-end_ts="284.045" title="283.925" id=c_"283.925">__I__</span>, I could have asked a whole bunch of people on the web to ask questions that they would want to ask you themselves. So we'll just have to forego that. And, but let's, let's do it this way and give you a chance to sort of like, how did you get here? I mean, and, and the problem with you is there's a whole bunch of <span style="color:red" data-ts="300.925" data-end_ts="301.125" title="300.925" id=c_"300.925">__you__</span>. There's, Darwin Gross, the serious analog guy. There's Darwin Gross, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_%2774">Cycling '74</a> guy <span style="color:red" data-ts="306.925" data-end_ts="307.085" title="306.925" id=c_"306.925">__there__</span>. And from my point of view, there's Darvin Gross, my producer and mastering engineer for my own artistic practice. I mean, there's a whole bunch of you, right? And so choose one of those and tell me a little bit about how you got here. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I'm gonna kind of, to answer that, I'll kind of weave a two-part story. You know, first of all, I can talk a little bit about where my interest in music and art come from. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Awesome. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It comes from kind of a peculiar place. I grew up in northern Wisconsin, which is an extremely rural place. It's the kind of a joint where you just simply wouldn't, wouldn't often think of people having much of an interaction with the outside world. But one, a couple of things happen in those kind of environments. One of 'em is that, religion and the church has a, has a very powerful play in people's lives, but also everybody knows each other to the point of not being able to stand it. And so <laugh> a certain kind of person like myself, just ends up hiding from the entire pop populace because you can't really stand any of these people, and frankly, they can't stand you either. Mm-Hmm. Getting back to kind of the church thing, the church was really important in my life because it was extraordinarily important to my parents. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>My parents were, part of, a very strict and extreme fundamentalist sect of the Baptist church. And in fact, my grandfather was, was involved in, creating like summer camps and even a university, oriented towards, people with that particular faith. I asked too many questions, and so they weren't really very fond of me a lot of times. There were a lot of times where, you know, I would, I would probe, you know, why are there these beliefs? You know, I mean, this group had some, I would say, very racist beliefs. And I would probe, I'd be like, why do, why do you believe that I don't see you? You know, this is supposed to be based off the Bible. I don't see where in the Bible it says that. And conversely, they would be able to interpret a part of the Bible that they thought did say that and gave them the right to the right to feel the way they do. But it was something that was very difficult for me intellectually to buy in. But because that was my family's way, it meant that I had to kind of find some mechanism of peace within this, for me troubling environment. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Despite that, that question of sort of authority and where that's located, though, the other thing that strikes me about this is, was music, was music acceptable or did its acceptability only extend to something like the degree to which its text was religiously orthodox? You certainly must have heard music at home then, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Not really. My two aunts, two of my aunts, aunt Eleanor and Aunt Arlene were two of the most incredible gospel keyboard players I've ever encountered in my life. They're amazing players. And so the, the sort of like that musical context within the, within the church was really influential to me. I mean, it was a, you know, acoustic piano and <span style="color:red" data-ts="521.275" data-end_ts="521.635" title="521.275" id=c_"521.275">__Oregon__</span> played wonderfully. I mean, it was a, that was a real eyeopener and a ear opener for me. But other than that, we did not, my my mother listened to the radio all the time, but what it was was preachers on the air. Mm mm. And so there was this constant din of shouting men in the background <laugh> as I grew up. Right. But other than that, we really didn't kind of, we didn't interact with the world as it was called. And so that meant that that meant that music and that kind of stuff had a kind of a peculiar place for me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="559.075" data-end_ts="559.365" title="559.075" id=c_"559.075">__Well__</span>, it was suspect, right? Well, the world <span style="color:red" data-ts="562.505" data-end_ts="562.725" title="562.505" id=c_"562.505">__is__</span>, I guess what 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Sort of, I mean, there was still, you know, you still had to know sing Happy Birthday, and I had an uncle who'd play a little fiddle every once in a while or whatever. But for the most part, yeah, it was just, wasn't, wasn't a thing. What was a thing though, was at the time, a, a local town, suring, Wisconsin, had a Christian radio station, and they were, of course, always looking for, something to put on the air. And so our church, as well as many of the other local churches, would record sermons and record their music, and it would be played on the local radio station along with the shouting preachers. Our church had a small little recording booth, and it was manned by, by Oscar. Oscar the only, pretty much completely deaf audio engineer I've ever encountered in my life. <laugh>, it was really quite amazing. He did everything by sight and by complaint. So for him, the placement of a mic had to be exactly the same. It was as it was last week when nobody complained. Right. And if somebody would complain, then he would keep adjusting the mic until people stop complaining anymore. And I mean, the complaints were like, geez, Oscar, it's screaming out 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>There, <laugh>. You know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Or like the volumes on, we had like one of these Sure mixers with the four knob mixing concept. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Oh, I remember those babies. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. And, he would have little tape markers on there, and you could see where like the previous four or five markers had been put, where it had sat for a while until someone complain, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Boy, this is not the origin of your career that I would ever have experienced <laugh>. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>There you go. And so basically, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Well, that's your whole thing about presets though, isn't it? Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Oh yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b><laugh>, it's like, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I mean, it's, it's my thing about a lot of things I, so, you know, working with him, first of all, you know, I asked to, to work with him, and my uncle actually was, was helping him before. And my uncle started getting involved in girlfriends and stuff. And so Oscar was looking for a new person to help him. And initially it was just, you know, we had a reel <span style="color:red" data-ts="703.245" data-end_ts="703.365" title="703.245" id=c_"703.245">__to__</span> reel deck. Initially it was, it was taking the tape off at the end, logging the tape, and then handing it off to Mr. Heus so he could take it to the radio station later. It was, doing things like we then we would have multiple cassette decks and different portions of the service would get recorded on different decks. So all of these special music would be recorded on one deck. All of the sermons on another deck, things that were sort of like special dedications to people and stuff was recorded on another deck. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And so just kind of managing and maintaining this kinda stuff was sort of my job. And then eventually Oscar sometimes would get tired and would fall asleep during the sermon and wouldn't therefore, do a good job of changing the knobs when the sermon was done and the music was gonna start again. So he asked if I would run the console. So then I got behind the console, and I, of course could be somewhat more adventurous than he, because I could hear <laugh>. So, so I started playing around a little bit with eq. I mean, because of that nature. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>You're front of, you became a front of house guy 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sort of, yeah. Because of the nature of the thing. You know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="784.085" data-end_ts="784.325" title="784.085" id=c_"784.085">__there__</span> I had to actually, patch in an external eq, but we had one and I did it, and all of a sudden the pastor was like, you know, I've never heard my voice this good before. Hmm. This is fabulous. You know, I sound like something other than a squeaking mouse. That's good. And, you know, I did some of that kind of stuff and it was really where I first cut my bones as, as a engineer, as a person who was like, I had to figure out, how does, you know, we've got this ev microphone that I've never heard of before. What does it do? Well, and this was before, this is before the internet, so I couldn't just google up the mic. Right. I had to go in the back closet and dig through all of the 10 million cassettes and reel <span style="color:red" data-ts="831.805" data-end_ts="831.885" title="831.805" id=c_"831.805">__to__</span> reel tapes to find a manual to find out that, oh, it's a HyperCard. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What does that mean? Oh, okay. That means it sort of does this, and it kind looks in this direction. And then it's, and then it's like, oh, the choir mic mics are this other microphone, and then what do those do? And I go and look. And it's like, well, that's weird. It's an omnidirectional, but it's sitting right next to the pa speaker. That doesn't seem right. <laugh>. And so then I kind of moved some mics around, and believe me, the first time Oscar saw that he was not pleased. I can imagine. But you know, when I explained some of what I was trying to do, you know, through a combination of hand gestures, really loud talking and, showing him the manual, he eventually decided to give it a try. And it, and it worked. And it worked. You know, it was, it was kind of that trial by fire. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And also to me, it sort of hearkens back to the old sort of tape op kind of thing where you start off working at the <span style="color:red" data-ts="893.905" data-end_ts="894.325" title="893.905" id=c_"893.905">__juries__</span> job and eventually you get enough respect, so you get to try <span style="color:red" data-ts="900.365" data-end_ts="900.565" title="900.365" id=c_"900.365">__the__</span> thing. Right? Yeah. And so I remember the first Sunday night, 'cause Sunday you'd never mess around with stuff on Sunday, Sunday morning, the Sunday morning service. But either the Sunday night or the Wednesday night service was kind of game for trials, you know? So if we try a new machine or something like that. And so one Sunday night, I came in the afternoon and I reconfigured the microphones, and we tried it that night, and all of a sudden we could have it much louder without getting feedback. And again, we weren't getting a lot of, a lot of frequency, negation and stuff. So the, the sound of everyone's voices was really robust and beautiful. And it was a, it was one of those things. It was that hook where when you do something and it's just an outright success, and most people didn't actually really know that anything had changed, A few people could figure it out. And, but for me to have had just like an unvarnished win, right? Yeah. That was a thing that sort of sealed it for me. But you can see how something like this totally <span style="color:red" data-ts="969.295" data-end_ts="969.535" title="969.295" id=c_"969.295">__would__</span> really occupy me when I wasn't really into the church's output. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Well, and when I think about, when I think about the person that, that you came to be, that I know that sort of relentlessly practical, trust your senses, try this out, see what works, and if it works, that's what you'll, you know, that's the <span style="color:red" data-ts="990.555" data-end_ts="990.775" title="990.555" id=c_"990.555">__net__</span> that brings you to the next step of things, right? That's totally you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I guess it is. Oh man. I haven't really thought about it that way, but certainly everything I've become has, has been as a result of Oscar and his, his willingness to both help me out and to, and to sort of set me up to. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>But what I find interesting about that story is, and what's different to me than the tape op thing, is that, let's say, if you think of people like Jeff talking about being a tape op back in the British Studio Sessions series in the sixties Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, there's that sense that your mentors were expected to teach you how stuff worked and didn't. What I hear in your story about Oscar is that Oscar was patient and willing to do stuff with you, but actually Oscar didn't know any of the things that you found out, did he? Or if he did, he forgot about them. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's funny, Oscar was one of those people that I think existed in the sixties and early seventies that you don't find anymore. Or if you do, they're living in a van down by the river. Right. <laugh>, I mean, he had, he owned a home, which was sort of a storefront, but it was a storefront that was never open to sell anything. Oh, wow. But if you could 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Small town America, man. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. But if you could walk in there, you could see that basically every radio that had ever been bust or TV that had ever been broken in the entire town found their way into his storefront. You know? So I think he got into it. He was drawn into it because it's sort of like, Hey, this recording stuff that's electronics, and Oscar seems to know electronics 'cause he fixes radios. Of course. Of course. So he's gonna be our guy. Right. And, you know, so he was a lot more into saying, well, this power cord's failing. Let me replace the power cord. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1105.145" data-end_ts="1105.365" title="1105.145" id=c_"1105.145">__Mm__</span>. And not so much into let's get a good sounding recording, because he wouldn't know. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Okay. So, so here's I guess where, here's my next couple of questions. Okay. 'cause they're all sort of connected together. All right. So, I wanna get from that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1122.985" data-end_ts="1123.205" title="1122.985" id=c_"1122.985">__guy__</span> to you, but I have another question about something that you've sort of hinted at a little bit. And that is, I'm really curious as to how I culture's too big a word to use, but somehow or other, your interest in doing that kind of stuff got, got connected to some kind of music. What you've described is a relatively sort of, sheltered existence, or at least something where your interaction with culture in the wider world was mediated by your parents' views on things. Right. How did things like music and culture enter your life in that surrounding? Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You know, this is, I mean, luckily, I guess for me and unluckily, I would guess for my parents, you can't keep all culture away. Right? So I went to a public school, and, in a public school, you get, you know, you hear what other kids are into and you find out what, you know, you go to a music class, and in the music class, they end up playing a Chuck Berry record. Or, for a while when I was like a freshman in high school, there was this listening group, right. And the library sponsored listening group. And what listening group was, was everybody brought a record from home, and then they would choose one to listen. Well, <laugh>, I'll never forget the first time there was the listening group. I brought one of the four, I mean, my parents had like four albums. It was like the, the soundtrack to my Fair Lady, the soundtrack to South Pacific. One that was some sort of like, weird, big, big band thing, but it had like banjo player pictures on the front, you know, like strum along with the guy in the barbershop suit kind of 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Thing. Oh yeah. That would be like four. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Something like that. I don't know. And then, and then the fourth one was my favorite of their four albums was, which was the, the Sons of the Pioneers singing all day. I've paced the Narrow Waste without a Taste of Water. Oh, yeah. You know, with these really tight harmonies and stuff. So I was like, well, if I'm gonna bring something, it's gonna be being Be Cool Water. Right. So I bring that and, pat Meyers brings Queen's first album, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b><laugh> <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. My, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Well, which <span style="color:red" data-ts="1271.805" data-end_ts="1272.005" title="1271.805" id=c_"1271.805">__has__</span> tight, tight harmonies. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Right. Exactly. But you know what, nobody <span style="color:red" data-ts="1276.755" data-end_ts="1277.045" title="1276.755" id=c_"1276.755">__more__</span> heavily, because that was one of those things where as a kid, you know, you know how as a kid you like see warning signs Yeah. Early enough that you can just prevent total humiliation. That was the one where it was like, I saw him walking past with the Queen album, and it, it informed me that I shouldn't take the Sons of the Pioneers out of the locker <laugh>. Right. Thank goodness. 'cause I would've been pummeled. Right. But about that time, I also, for Christmas, got a guitar and acoustic guitar, and my parents sent me to, so I had studied piano for years, but I had the world's worst piano teacher. She just basically every week would assign me a page, one page into John W. Thompson, one page in John w Shams book. And I would have to basically learn to read it and play it, and then come back. She never would actually play me anything of, so I knew what it should sound like. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And even after eight years of eight years of, piano lessons, she had not taught me enough theory. So I would not have, I would've not have been able to tell you what AC chord was. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1351.025" data-end_ts="1351.245" title="1351.025" id=c_"1351.025">__Huh__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And so, you know, I had facility on a keyboard without any knowledge, which was really a problem. But I had this thing in my head where I, I thought, you know, I don't wanna play piano. I wanna play guitar, because eventually when I get outta this damn place a guitar, I can strap on my back, put on my motorcycle, and leave this hick town. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Got it. Yeah. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Where I can't really do that with a piano. So, my parents bought me a guitar <span style="color:red" data-ts="1381.265" data-end_ts="1381.485" title="1381.265" id=c_"1381.265">__as__</span> funky little, well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>They did. Well, they have pianos in other cities, you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Know. I know. But not, not, yeah. I don't know. It was, the whole romantic vision wasn't Right. Wasn't it wasn't on my piano, and it wasn't strapped <span style="color:red" data-ts="1392.725" data-end_ts="1392.885" title="1392.725" id=c_"1392.725">__on__</span> my back on my motorcycle, so, got it. It didn't fit the picture. Right. Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b><affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But, the fact of the matter was, I, I wanted to try the guitar thing. My parents got me this funky, like jazz echo guitar, and I, and I took some lessons from someone who wanted me to play sort of classical style, and I made her feel good by doing what she showed me. And she was just like, oh, you're such a natural musician. But that's 'cause I had studied piano, so I knew how to like, read music, and I, I could figure out how to transfer that to the guitar, but I couldn't stand it. But, and so I kind of dropped it, that spring. I didn't take any more lessons. And, and then, you know, by this time I had a car, so there were other interests for me and stuff like that. But I was also blessed by having my, my parents were co-owners of a small company that made farming equipment, and, which meant that every summer we had jobs. And so the summer, the, that summer, my job was to basically drive around and mow lawns at the very various company locations because it was farming equipment. They'd have these fields that were just chockfull of equipment waiting to be sold. So I'd have to go and mow lawn around those things and stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Oh, sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And, it was a great job because it was solitary. I didn't have to deal with none of knuckleheads in the, in the area or whatever. And, you know, again, you can imagine I am into like, recording and, you know, maybe the guitar and stuff like this, and everybody else is just pretty much getting drunk all the time because it's small town America, and there's nothing to do but get drunk or get high. And I wasn't into it. And certainly with my religious background, I didn't have a, you know, I didn't have any kinda history with it, so that wasn't my scene. So instead I was just very solitary. And so doing this job was great. I'd sit on a lawnmower all day and just think thoughts. Right. And, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1519.525" data-end_ts="1519.805" title="1519.525" id=c_"1519.525">__would__</span>, I remember one time just having one of those days where it's like, there wasn't much to think about. And I came home at lunchtime to eat lunch, and I opened up the back of Popular Mechanics. My dad was a subscriber to Popular Mechanics. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>I remember that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. And back in the day, the, if you weren't into actually the mechanics of Pop Popular Mechanics, what was really interesting was to go to the back of the book where there were the classified ads. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Oh, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Because people would put in classified ads for complete, who knows what reason, and 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Right. Everything from x-Ray spectacles, and C Monkeys Exactly. To do it yourself, Geiger Counter kits. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Or in my case, Artie Tram's, bluegrass guitar book. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1563.105" data-end_ts="1563.325" title="1563.105" id=c_"1563.105">__Oh__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>He advertises a book about playing bluegrass guitar. Now, given my completely limited knowledge of what was going on, what I thought Bluegrass guitar was, was actually banjo. I didn't know that wasn't a guitar. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Oh. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Or I, or maybe I should have. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>How would No, how would you know? Well, because we <span style="color:red" data-ts="1585.865" data-end_ts="1586.085" title="1585.865" id=c_"1585.865">__are__</span> big, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1586.165" data-end_ts="1586.285" title="1586.165" id=c_"1586.165">__he__</span> watchers, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1586.885" data-end_ts="1587.005" title="1586.885" id=c_"1586.885">__the__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1587.005" data-end_ts="1587.125" title="1587.005" id=c_"1587.005">__way__</span> that stuff is mediated to you is primarily through recordings, and you can't tell what a thing is by listening to it. You have to see it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, yeah, except for one thing, which is that we had a TV and we watched Heehaw all the time. It was my Soul Non-Church musical influence really? Other than other than, pat Meyers, queen El <laugh>. But anyway, yeah. So I was like, I was like, well, you know, I, I was thinking about it, and then I go and sit on the, this is another thing that's really sort of common for me. I went and sat on the lawnmower for four hours, at which point I had generated a complete picture of what my world was gonna look like once I knew how to play bluegrass guitar <laugh>. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b><laugh>. Yeah. No, you, you have space in which to imagine your future. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So I took a, I wrote a check for $4 95 cents, put it in the mail and waited for the requisite six weeks for it to show up at which point it comes. And I get it, and it's got a little sound sheet in it so you can hear what you're supposed to sound like. And I put it on and I'm like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1656.905" data-end_ts="1657.125" title="1656.905" id=c_"1656.905">__Ooh__</span>, this isn't anything like what I thought it was, but it's actually, it's actually still kind of cool. And so I learned, you know, start off learning under the Double Eagle, and then Mom, don't allow no guitar pick around here and, cripple Creek and a bunch of those kind of old style bluegrass tunes done in a flat picking guitar style. Right. Well, it's, it turns out that that was really good training because even though I didn't have <span style="color:red" data-ts="1684.325" data-end_ts="1684.445" title="1684.325" id=c_"1684.325">__a__</span> overriding desire to be a phenomenal bluegrass player, I did like the idea of becoming a sophisticated guitar player. And so, you know, some of the technique you have to learn to be a good bluegrass player is good 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Technique. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1698.285" data-end_ts="1698.405" title="1698.285" id=c_"1698.285">__Yeah__</span>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1698.405" data-end_ts="1698.445" title="1698.405" id=c_"1698.405">__But__</span> that physical technique translates to other styles. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But also it's folk music and folk music. You learn chords and you learn how chords connect to each other. Oh. And that was when the door swung open for me music wise, because all of a sudden it was like, oh, I don't have to wake up blessed by God to be Bach in order to write music. I can take an E minor and AG and AD and an a and come up with a really neat sounding thing that I could play for hours and continue to amuse myself. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>But at this point, you're not playing with other people, are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>No, no. Totally by myself. But this, this kind of thing, and getting into the guitar is what really swung things open. Because first of all, I started going to Marinette to take lessons from a guy. I wish I could remember his name. He <span style="color:red" data-ts="1748.485" data-end_ts="1748.565" title="1748.485" id=c_"1748.485">__was__</span> a phenomenal guitar player, but he taught me a lot of things about like rock guitar playing as well as, as folk and, and, bluegrass stuff. But he also taught me some rock stuff, and Well, and he was teaching in the back of a record store. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1765.825" data-end_ts="1766.045" title="1765.825" id=c_"1765.825">__Oh__</span>, here it comes. Yep. I feel my next question coming 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Home <laugh> just about, well, I'll, I'll kind of front <span style="color:red" data-ts="1773.425" data-end_ts="1773.645" title="1773.425" id=c_"1773.425">__end__</span> it for you. So I go in one day and, the teacher is so sad, and I'm like, what's, what's the matter? You really look beat down? He's like, well, today Elvis Presley died. I'm like, huh. The fat guy from tv. He died. He's like, no, you don't understand man, Elvis Presley. He was everything. He was rock and roll. And I was like, huh, okay. So, so he teaches me the lesson and he's kind of merose through the whole thing. And then I broke his heart because afterwards I had saved up enough money to get my first album, or the first album that I bought bought for myself. Right. And he's like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1812.145" data-end_ts="1812.365" title="1812.145" id=c_"1812.145">__oh__</span>, dude, you ought to get, you ought to get a good Elvis just to, to commemorate the date you ought to get a good Elvis album. I was like, now I'm not feeling Elvis today, but I've been eyeing that, that Blue Oyster Cult album, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b><laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Or No, not Blue Oyster Cult, rush Rush, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Oh, 21? Seriously? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>No, no. The live album. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Oh my goodness. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I can't remember the name of it. Right. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>I am the 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Priest. Yeah. Ben Neville would kill me for not remembering the name of this. He, Lord, I have Rush, rush History together. But, so I get the live album, and I, I get home, but, you know, my parents are home. I can't play it because they'll freak out. Right. So, I wait until the next day, and at lunchtime, <laugh>, I sneak home and nobody's home. Yay. Right. So I put, put this on. I didn't know which side was which, so I just flopped, whatever it was. It was like, I think side three, which had Horne a Snow Dog, which is this long kind of operatic rock prog rock piece. Right. And its guitars through Wawa Pedals and Enormous Echoes. And I had never heard anything like this in my life. And I just sat there mesmerized as this, as my little repeat record player would play the same side over and over again. I must've listened to it seven times. I'd never showed up to work that afternoon. <laugh>, you know, they <span style="color:red" data-ts="1901.725" data-end_ts="1901.885" title="1901.725" id=c_"1901.725">__ended__</span> up calling my parents that night. Is there something wrong with Darwin? He didn't show up this afternoon and stuff, but I was just mesmerized. And all of a sudden I realized all of this recording technology and all this guitar stuff and all of this, these electronic things, all kind of could combine into something 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>To make that, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>To make that right. And that was the, that was the beginning of the quest, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1925.045" data-end_ts="1925.165" title="1925.045" id=c_"1925.045">__of__</span> course. And I mean, to this day, I'm still trying to emulate by Thorn the snow <span style="color:red" data-ts="1928.845" data-end_ts="1929.045" title="1928.845" id=c_"1928.845">__do__</span> in some way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>So here's the thing. So a whole bunch of that story so far is maybe very different than everybody else's, but there's the thing that we all know, which is like, I heard something and made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. And I thought, absolutely. How is that done? How do I do that? Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And so for me, then that began a quest of like, okay, so when I play, so first of all, I need electric guitar. So I worked a whole summer, and I got an Ivanna old 59 <span style="color:red" data-ts="1959.685" data-end_ts="1959.805" title="1959.685" id=c_"1959.685">__er__</span> emulation of a Les Paul of 59 Les Paul. It was actually a beautiful instrument. And so I get it, and then I plug it into, you know, I didn't have anything else, so I just plugged it into back of my amp so I could play along with the record, except my little twangy dorky thing didn't sound anything like the, the guitar player in Rush. So I'm just like, well, you know, Alex, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1984.715" data-end_ts="1985.005" title="1984.715" id=c_"1984.715">__Lisa__</span>, Alex Lisa did something, to make that sound. I wonder what it could be. So the next time I would save up enough money, I would go into Green Bay to the record, to the music store, and be like, okay, what is the thing that makes it go? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And they're like, oh, you need a Fuzz Tone pedal. Right. So then they would let me try out a Fuzz Tone pedal, and then I would know how much money I had to save. So then I'd get a Fuzz Tone pedal. It's like, okay, well, it makes it grindy sound, but when he plays it and he does these slidey things, it lasts a long time. And when I do it, it just sound kind of goes Don <span style="color:red" data-ts="2023.495" data-end_ts="2023.845" title="2023.495" id=c_"2023.495">__Doink__</span>. Right. <laugh>. So I wonder what that's about. Oh, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2026.565" data-end_ts="2026.685" title="2026.565" id=c_"2026.565">__I__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2026.685" data-end_ts="2026.885" title="2026.685" id=c_"2026.685">__take__</span>, go to the music store, like, oh, you need a delay, you know, which at the time, at an Echoplex, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Yeah, absolutely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, there was no way I was gonna save up for an Echoplex, but Multi Vxx made a thing that used an eight track cassette tape as the tape environment and just had two heads in it. And so that was my echo for a while. And then it was like, now, now Lysin kind of goes, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2055.625" data-end_ts="2055.845" title="2055.625" id=c_"2055.625">__wha__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2055.905" data-end_ts="2056.125" title="2055.905" id=c_"2055.905">__wha__</span> Like when he's playing, I go in and they're like, oh, there's this pedal called the Wawa pedal. You know, just kinda like working my way through trying to figure this stuff out. It was grueling because first of all, you know, it took a lot <span style="color:red" data-ts="2068.105" data-end_ts="2068.325" title="2068.105" id=c_"2068.105">__of__</span>, at the time, you know, a Wawa pedal was the same $90 as it is now, except back then 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>$90 was a lot more money. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Me working for 90 bucks was three weeks work. So there was this whole interval when I would obsess about what is the exact best Wawa pedal, and thankfully Guitar Player magazine existed. So I had some focus for my obsession, and I would just, it would give me lots of time to really obsess about what was gonna be the ultimate Wawa pedal, what was gonna be the ultimate, just, you know, fuzz tone, you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Know? And you know what, you still you still do 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That. I know, I still do that. I, I just, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Like, I was just thinking about you and I having that discussion about like, the best filter. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2113.465" data-end_ts="2113.685" title="2113.465" id=c_"2113.465">__Oh__</span>, last night I just got, I got an AJH mini Mod Transistor Ladder filter, because this is my like eighth ladder filter, and I'm still not, you know, I haven't been happy yet. So maybe this one is the ultimate. Yeah. I still do it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>But the point, yeah. But here's the other thing about that that I think is kind of interesting and maybe not like everybody else, is that it's, it's a sort of pr a sequential process that has a certain amount of feedback built into it. Oh, yeah. You're not, you're not idly acquiring things just for the sake of acquiring them. You have a very specific kind of thing that you're aiming toward in mind. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sort of less so now than I did then. I mean, back then the Sounds of the Sounds of Rush or Blue Oyster Cult or deep Purple Storm Bringer album and some of these things that was, that was the sound that I couldn't understand. And so I had to go and, and also there were like limitations. 'cause I, I actually ended up, you know, about in the middle of this quest, I ended up getting tickets to go see <span style="color:red" data-ts="2187.985" data-end_ts="2188.205" title="2187.985" id=c_"2187.985">__The__</span> Purple. The <span style="color:red" data-ts="2189.045" data-end_ts="2189.165" title="2189.045" id=c_"2189.045">__D__</span> Purple actually opened for this other bands. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2191.405" data-end_ts="2191.525" title="2191.405" id=c_"2191.405">__D__</span> Purple was on the decline already. Right. But here was this guy whose records I listened to, and I'm like, oh my God, I'm gonna get a chance to find out how this works. Right. So he comes and it turns out he plugs his Les Paul into a Wawa pedal into a really large Marshall Amp turned up to 10. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Ah. And something happens when it's turned up to 10. Right. That you don't get. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, the other thing is though, when you take <span style="color:red" data-ts="2218.965" data-end_ts="2219.085" title="2218.965" id=c_"2218.965">__a__</span>, any amp and turn it up to 10, it's loud enough that the parents can hear what you're doing. Good. And they're not gonna be happy <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Yeah, good point. No. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, you know, this is another thing where it's sort of like this sort of like isolated, almost hidden work, is, is really reveals 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Itself. Yeah. But, you know. Yeah. But you know what? There's a real advantage to that. And, and, there's a period in my life when I get to listen to what I listen to for very different reasons. But the idea is there's no adult around to tell you what you're supposed to think about, what you listen to. So your experience with it is like really personal and really immediate. And I think that's however you arrive at that, at that end, that's a really interesting thing to form your sensibility. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, I agree. You end up, you end up developing a voice, even <span style="color:red" data-ts="2267.885" data-end_ts="2267.965" title="2267.885" id=c_"2267.885">__if__</span> you're not, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Well have to trust yourself. Well, you have to trust yourself because there's nobody else around to talk to. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>One of the downsides to it is that even if you do develop an interesting voice of some sort, because it doesn't sound like in my case, like the Purple Storm bringer album, you're very unhappy with the voice that you found. Right? Hmm. And so there's a lot of dissatisfaction and you don't have the feedback mechanism to help you say, Hey, that sounds great, or, Hey, you're, you've actually exceeded something here Then, then the dude from Deep Purple could never do. But, you know, because it doesn't sound like that. And because especially in this environment, you know, nobody would <span style="color:red" data-ts="2312.845" data-end_ts="2313.045" title="2312.845" id=c_"2312.845">__wanna__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2313.045" data-end_ts="2313.165" title="2313.045" id=c_"2313.045">__hear__</span> it. So I actually started playing with the band I bought. I was working, one of the jobs I had was working at a ski hill and inexplicably, some guy rolls into the ski hill, comes into the ski rental thing and says, do you wanna buy a guitar <span style="color:red" data-ts="2327.465" data-end_ts="2327.685" title="2327.465" id=c_"2327.465">__and__</span> an amplifier? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>No, seriously. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And I'm like, I don't know, maybe on 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>The ski resort. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And I'm like, I don't know. Maybe he's like, come on, I'll show it to you. So I go out to his car and he's got basically just some old hunk of junk plank guitar and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2345.805" data-end_ts="2345.925" title="2345.805" id=c_"2345.805">__I__</span> that I knew already I wasn't gonna be interested in it. Right. And then the amp was a Vox AC 30 amp. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2353.025" data-end_ts="2353.245" title="2353.025" id=c_"2353.025">__Ooh__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So I said, I'll take the amp. He, I'm <span style="color:red" data-ts="2356.325" data-end_ts="2356.365" title="2356.325" id=c_"2356.325">__gonna__</span> sell a boat. And I'm like, I don't want that. I don't want the canoe paddle <laugh>, I just want the amplifier. So he sells it to me, and it's in really bad shape. Speakers all ripped apart. So I go to Radio Shack and get a replacement cheap speaker. And most, most of the tubes are literally busted in the socket. But luckily this was still when you could go to a drugstore and find an old tube machine. Find 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Yeah. Find tubes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. And find tubes. So I found some tubes to make it work. And you know, luckily Oscar was around to help, 'cause he was still around at the time. And I got it operational. It had this thing where when you turn it way up, it would start to self oscillate. So I think my, the cheap or the, you know, the used tubes that I had bought off of Oscar, I think some of 'em were pretty messy, but nevertheless, it made God's own sound. Man. It was loud and nasty. But that gave me that in combination with my dis my Fuzz box and my Wawa pedal. And, my multi VX delay gave me the tools necessary to be in a band. Right. Of course. So, some friends, and I put together a little band thing, and it was horrible. Like all those bands are, but it opened another door, which was, we had a band, which was a bunch of people <span style="color:red" data-ts="2436.445" data-end_ts="2436.645" title="2436.445" id=c_"2436.445">__with__</span> instruments, but we didn't have any pa guitar Player Magazine came through with a book called, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Electronic Project. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Electronic Project Musicians. Exactly. Which, Craig Ton told us how to make a little, mixer for our PA and stuff like that. And so I bought kits and I started working on, I kind kind of got it kind of working. And then, it was time for me to go off to college and the band kind of split up anyway, and I ended up with all these parts and la la la Next thing you know, I'm, I've got a mixer, but no band, which was kind of perfect, <laugh> and, much better for me. Right. And so 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>A mixer will get you through times of no band better than a band will get you through times of no mixer. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and what it would also do is in combination with a couple of cassette decks, give you the ability to do sound on sound recording. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Oh, good 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Point. And so I started, my mom's got these pictures where I took like the basement bathroom and, put a plank over the sink and, stacked up my two recorders and my little mixer and my headphones. And I'd sit on the toilet seat and, play guitar and record overdub on overdub on overdub in these, cassette recorders. And it was, you know, again, how I cut some of those, those kind of teeth. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Very Les Paul, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Very Les Pauly. Right. And so then I went off to school, I started meeting people. I first went to school in Arkansas, a religious school there. And I met some people that became, you know, really good friends. We all kind of picked up and moved down to Dallas. I got my residency in the state of Texas, and then was able to attend, what at the time was North Texas State University. Now it's University of North Texas, but, NTSU at the time, which great jazz program. Yeah. It had the only jazz guitar program around. And, you know, I'd always maintained my guitar chops, but I didn't even know what I was getting into. So I go traipsing up there, I'm like, Hey, I wanna play. Right. And I'd do, my little solo guitar satin doll thing that I had put together. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And he was like, oh, that's really nice. You have to start from like our lowest possible level. Right. <laugh>. And so I do. And, you know, after I get my residency there, I, I start, I go to school and I start wood shedding. And it caused a lot of things to happen. First of all, I got to be really focused on technique and not on the music because my technique was so far behind all these other kids that have been studying jazz with like real teachers in real places. And so I had a lot of technique to get caught up on it. And I became obsessed with technique, but also because of the difficulty, the difficulty of the test. So basically <span style="color:red" data-ts="2614.305" data-end_ts="2614.525" title="2614.305" id=c_"2614.305">__you__</span> would have, you know, on test day, they would make everybody stand in line outside this room, and you'd go in this room and there would be three hard faced old men who would just like shout out things for you to play. And you had to play 'em on the fly at a specific predetermined tempo. And it, I started getting really bad psychological ticks. So it first started with tempo recognition. Almost everything that they wanted you to do was like 16th notes over 120 BPM, which is fast, but not crazy. Right. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>It's not bebop but 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Close. Right. But what would happen is I would, I would, you know, sit with my metronome. I would practice eight to 10 hours a day. I was obsessed. I was married at the time to my first wife. And it would drive her insane because the whole time I'm sitting there going, right. And I could get to where I could do this stuff at 180, 1 90, easily, I could just breeze right over the top of it. But the second I recognized that I was getting at one 20, I would start, I would start clamming, I would start falling apart because I knew that's where I would be tested. Hmm. Right. And then, things started happening, like while playing my arm or my leg would kind of like shoot out off to the side. Wow. As, as if like rejecting the rest of my body and my attempt to play. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. It was really a psychological weirdness that was, that was pretty rough to take. But simultaneously with that, you know, I had accumulated and I took some, some money my parents had had provided for me. And instead of using it for my education or something useful, I instead bought a task <span style="color:red" data-ts="2724.465" data-end_ts="2724.685" title="2724.465" id=c_"2724.465">__cam__</span> 80 dash eight track recorder. Oh. And a Model five mixer and a Fostex reverb and, some microphones. And I had started doing a lot of recording. Well, I took my pile of gear and mixed it up with the pile of gear, some other guys. And we kicked off, inside track recording in Denton. It was my first, recording studio. And, while I was really having a tough time with, with the school and with doing the jazz guitar education stuff, I was killing it with the recording stuff we were doing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I would do, you know, a kids' sing-along album one week and then, ultra hard, hardcore Texas punk album the next week. And then, then the week after that it would be like doing a commercial for a bank, bank commercial or whatever. It was amazing. And I got a chance to, to try to do whatever, to do one of everything. Right. We also did this really cool thing, which was to basically finance, keeping the studio open. We had this thing where people would take a class with us to learn how to use all our equipment. And then they had the opportunity for like, I think it was a hundred dollars a month. They could have, they could sign up to use any unused studio time that we had. Oh, cool. And so there were a number of people who really liked doing recording, but really couldn't play, or if they could play, they didn't play that much. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And so what they would do is they would just get random groups of musicians to come in and just make wild, crazy noise stuff. Right. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And so I always put myself in the middle of that. I was like, you know, that way I could be around <span style="color:red" data-ts="2834.365" data-end_ts="2834.525" title="2834.365" id=c_"2834.365">__to__</span> turn on the lights for you and stuff, but I can also play all the time and I can, I can work with all these different musicians. So it was a great opportunity to play lots of different crazy styles with a lot of different crazy people. It was a lot of fun, and I really got my chops together. But at some point I came to the realization that, first of all, north Texas, and I didn't necessarily see eye to eye North Texas, the school. But also, the fact that I had a family and, I was about to have a child sort of was like the wake up call to say, oh, you have to be a grownup now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, I sold the, my portion of the studio for next to nothing, sold off most of my guitars and stuff, because this, this performance anxiety thing was really freaking me out. So I just kind of walked away from it all and moved back to Wisconsin, took a job at my dad's, the company my dad helped run. And, basically they had me, tortured testing chains for the engineering department. And a couple of weeks into that, the chain busted and I was trying to put the chains, the chain back together when my cousin hit the power button. The chain slammed together, snagged the tips, all the tips of the fingers on my left hand, and stretched 'em out about an extra three inches, busting the tips off and just completely destroying the integrity of the tips of my fingers. Which that was the end of my guitar <span style="color:red" data-ts="2934.835" data-end_ts="2935.115" title="2934.835" id=c_"2934.835">__playing__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Of your guitar career. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So, I mean, still, I, I still play, but it's kind of painful to play. And, I can, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>I can only imagine. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. And what's funny is that, is that I kind of got back into music again, because there was a country band up there that <span style="color:red" data-ts="2952.935" data-end_ts="2953.155" title="2952.935" id=c_"2952.935">__in__</span> that offered to have me come play. And we got to be, you know, pretty good friends. And there was some phenomenal just drummer in that band was outrageously good. And, you know, it was playing country, which had no emotional importance to me, hence I didn't have any of the stage fright issues. What it turns out is all that stage fright stuff was all about competition and had nothing to do with performance are playing. And so, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Yeah. But the problem was it took a while to figure that out, didn't 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It? Yeah. Well, and there are certain kinds of music that are more competitive than others. Jazz is a very competitive form of music. Bluegrass actually is a very competitive form of music, folk and country. Not, seventies rock, not competitive, you know, who can, who can do the hottest licks, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3004.535" data-end_ts="3004.755" title="3004.535" id=c_"3004.535">__ala__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3005.735" data-end_ts="3005.955" title="3005.735" id=c_"3005.735">__ala__</span> Steve <span style="color:red" data-ts="3008.095" data-end_ts="3008.315" title="3008.095" id=c_"3008.095">__Vi__</span> very competitive. Right. And so I just learned I had to stay away from the competitive side of music making in general. But, you know, as a part of that, that got re me reignited in music. And then I started, building up a cooler guitar rig and stuff like that. Then I got a, I got back into recording with a little four <span style="color:red" data-ts="3030.965" data-end_ts="3031.285" title="3030.965" id=c_"3030.965">__track__</span> cassette <span style="color:red" data-ts="3031.765" data-end_ts="3032.005" title="3031.765" id=c_"3031.765">__back__</span>, and then all of a sudden it's like, Hey, there's this midi thing. And you know what, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>That's what I'm wondering about is, is I guess following this up would be really complicated, but the thing that I now know about you that I didn't know is I know a lot of people that have gone through some version of, of like one of those two or three things that happened to you and simply stopped making music Right. For whatever reason that ended. And somehow or other there's you. But then the other part of you that I'm really curious about is how did you turn into, an analog guy? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's kind of, you know, there's, there's a trail there too. You know, I mean, certainly when, so when, when I was kind of having a rough time with being a guitar player at, at North Texas, I actually switched over to the composition, the new music group run by Larry Austin. I never even actually met Larry that I know of Ryan. But I got to play in a lot of little ensembles in the group. And I also had access to these little studios that had like a 26 or 2,600 and a task <span style="color:red" data-ts="3095.185" data-end_ts="3095.405" title="3095.185" id=c_"3095.185">__cam__</span> 33 40 or whatever. Right. So I, so you use that to like, oh, sweet. Like make little electronic computer squeaky recordings, which is really great. But, for me, so 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>The 2,600 was your first synth? Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. First synth I used. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3111.885" data-end_ts="3112.165" title="3111.885" id=c_"3111.885">__Right__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>I've always wondered, I have always wondered about that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That, and then, and then after I, well, and also a friend of mine was a keyboard player, and he had like, something, it was like a Yamaha YC something or whatever. It had like presets for clarinet and stuff, you know, which I would misuse to make a wacky sounds <laugh> because it had, you know, you'd select a clarinet preset, but then you'd tweak the tone knob, which was the filter cutoff, and you could make some interesting stuff. And so, you know, I got a chance to play with that stuff a little bit. But the first thing I spent a lot of time on was the 2,600. But then, you know, I, I'm back in Wisconsin, I'm living in the middle of these people that I don't understand and they don't understand me. But again, I start reading Keyboard Magazine and it starts informing me about MIDI and it starts telling me, well, you know, Atlanta, the Atlanta Rhythm Shop sells MIDI gear, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And so I call 'em up and I'm like, well, how do I do this? And they're like, well, you get a sequencer and you get a keyboard and you make 'em talk to each other. And I'm like, sequencer, huh? You know, I, I remember that from like, the one that was with the 2,600, the, I can't remember the number of it, but a little 16. Like, I don't <span style="color:red" data-ts="3191.405" data-end_ts="3191.565" title="3191.405" id=c_"3191.405">__wanna__</span> do that. I wanna do, I wanna like, be able to write songs and stuff. And they're like, well, you might want to try, a MIDI interface for a computer. 'cause me and computers never gotten along very much up to that point. And I was like, yeah, I'll give it a try. So I get, and there was a lot of divisiveness tied into this, but I spend the money to get a, a little computer and a little interface, and I start, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3218.885" data-end_ts="3219.085" title="3218.885" id=c_"3218.885">__in__</span> a keyboard, which was an in Suns ESQ one, which could Oh, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Which could do multi <span style="color:red" data-ts="3224.655" data-end_ts="3225.005" title="3224.655" id=c_"3224.655">__Tamil__</span> work. So I could do, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3226.145" data-end_ts="3226.365" title="3226.145" id=c_"3226.145">__gee__</span>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3226.385" data-end_ts="3226.605" title="3226.385" id=c_"3226.385">__So__</span> if I remember, I was like four or six different sounds simultaneously, and now I had the ability to do stuff, so, well, I started off by like doing transcriptions of Little Feet Tunes or whatever, and had a, had a great time with that. But, and with this one singer, I was doing stuff where I was like doing backing tracks for, a one person or two person live show, stuff like that. And it was, that was all kind of the common uses of <span style="color:red" data-ts="3256.955" data-end_ts="3257.245" title="3256.955" id=c_"3256.955">__MIDI__</span> at the time. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But what was interesting to me also is that the, the sequencer, I started off with this Vora sequencer, but then it seemed like on a, on a pc, but it seemed like a lot of the PC people really gravitating towards cakewalk. So I, I ended up trying cakewalk as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And as you can tell from the story of this, I was spending a lot of my money <laugh> on this stuff. But nevertheless, it was cool because I was really getting an education. And the cool thing with Cakewalks cake with cakewalk was that it had this programming language in it called Cal the cakewalk application language, which I now know to have been a variant of the lisp language that was specific to their, how they <span style="color:red" data-ts="3302.005" data-end_ts="3302.125" title="3302.005" id=c_"3302.005">__d__</span> ran their internals of their system. Right. But for me, all I knew is that it gave me a mechanism by which I could take some notes that I had played in, and I wasn't a good keyboard player at that point <span style="color:red" data-ts="3314.175" data-end_ts="3314.525" title="3314.175" id=c_"3314.175">__where__</span> I could play in some notes and then I could transform 'em in all kinds of interesting ways. And so then I became, I started getting really into the idea of computer processing of note material a lot more than writing tunes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>At that point, I stopped working with this singer. I left her an lurch. I'm sure she still grinds her teeth every time she thinks about me. And I just, I, I started saying, you know what, this kind of puts me in a position of doing composition. You know, I had run across weird recording stuff that, weird recordings that I thought were cool that, you know, kind of pointed to this kind of thing. And this is about the time that I got divorced and I moved down to Milwaukee. And that's where things really kind of blew open for me because, shortly after moving to Milwaukee, I met Grant Richter who introduced me to his enormous bookla and his enormous Aries system, and his pair of 26 hundreds and a bunch of other analog gear and, and he was like, oh, you know, the rest 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Is history. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And he's like, oh, you know, recording. And you do, you know, I was, I kind of specialized in doing a lot of digital drumming type things. He's like, oh, so you can do kind of electronic based drumming stuff? And I'm like, yeah. And I, and he's like, so who do you like listening to? And I'd tell him and he'd be like, yeah, that's pop stuff. Listen to this. You know? And he'd play, he'd pull some weird record out of his closet and it would just like twist my brain crooked. And he was, he was sort of like that crazy older brother everyone should have in high school. Unfortunately I was 30 years old before I ran into him, but, or I mean, I was like 35 when I ran into him and he swung the door open to an amazing Penelope of stuff. And so I was in, man, I was in, and he did, he did me some really nice turns. He, he sold me a surge system that was kind of, it was sort of like the thing that held the door open in his living room, but because he didn't really like it in comparison to the ula, for me it was amazing. So I had this like big eight panel surge system I just loved. And you know, I just immersed myself in it. And, I had <span style="color:red" data-ts="3459.005" data-end_ts="3459.085" title="3459.005" id=c_"3459.005">__a__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3459.085" data-end_ts="3459.285" title="3459.085" id=c_"3459.085">__job__</span>. I'm 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Still thinking about the idea of a surge modular system as a door 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Stop. Yeah, well, I'll tell you, he was, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>That just makes tears, tears fill my eyes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, now, now, you know, at the time, and even in the mid nineties when I first was getting to know him in most cases, so he got all this gear because he was a field engineer for an electronics company. And what he would do <span style="color:red" data-ts="3480.665" data-end_ts="3480.885" title="3480.665" id=c_"3480.665">__is__</span> anytime he was in a town, he would call up the local university and say, do you have any old synthesizers you just want to get rid of? I'll buy 'em off you Uhhuh, or, or I'll offer a donation to your department. And bingo. So all of a sudden someone would be like, yeah, you know, we've got this, we've got, you know, these four buchla pieces that were left over and, you know, if you could give us 20 bucks, that'd be great. 'cause we could use that to get a new, tone arm for a record player or something. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? Yeah, I know, I hear you. But, yeah, and he put together an amazing collection of stuff and he allowed me to interact with it and, and learn it. And, and part of that learning then too, was him showing me the difference, you know, him saying, okay, the West Coast booklet thing doesn't have envelopes like the Ari's does, it has envelopes like this. And the reason is because his perspective of how a voice was created was like this. And, you know, you, you would always work with wave shaping on the <span style="color:red" data-ts="3542.765" data-end_ts="3543.125" title="3542.765" id=c_"3542.765">__booklet__</span>, which you'd never work with Wave shaping on the Aries because the Aries was badly trying to be a Moog, you know, and he just kind of taught me all that stuff. But also he introduced me into playing. So I, I started playing with a band that he was involved in called Fi I was the drummer. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Yeah, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3561.685" data-end_ts="3561.725" title="3561.685" id=c_"3561.685">__that__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3561.725" data-end_ts="3561.885" title="3561.725" id=c_"3561.725">__slash__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3561.905" data-end_ts="3562.125" title="3561.905" id=c_"3561.905">__eye__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? Yeah, exactly. And, you know, kind of doing this, this German, I, I don't know, sort of like power polka music <laugh>. I don't, I don't know how to properly frame it, right. But the way we would do it is everybody would kind like watch the Packer game and then come over and if the Packers did well, we'd pay, play an uptempo tune and if the Packers did poorly, we would play a dirge, right? And that was how these albums get made. We would just record three or four hours worth of material every weekend. And we ended up with this enormous pile of stuff that grant, or sometimes even very seldom me, grant Richard <span style="color:red" data-ts="3604.205" data-end_ts="3604.485" title="3604.205" id=c_"3604.205">__Ecky__</span> started playing with the band again. Then he got involved in doing some of the selection, I'm trying to remember, oh, he'd kill me, the guitar player's name, which I can't remember right now, but he was often involved in making some decisions about, he was the guy who also named all the tunes too. And he came up with fantastic tune names. But I was, I was primarily the drummer. And what I was doing was I was actually playing an a <span style="color:red" data-ts="3627.325" data-end_ts="3627.485" title="3627.325" id=c_"3627.325">__Kai__</span> MPC 2000 live. And you know, you can imagine playing a an MPC live for four hours on a Sunday afternoon. First of all, your timing chops kind of get honed pretty well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>I was gonna say, I've seen you, I've seen you play one and you're in fact very good at it. Yeah. Suddenly it all makes sense, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? Well, and also three to four hours in your hands get pretty tough and doing that kind of stuff. So that's the end of part one of this interview. Check out part two in order to hear the rest of the story.
