<b>Darwin: </b>All <span style="color:red" data-ts="11.305" data-end_ts="11.345" title="11.305" id=c_"11.305">__right__</span>. Today I'm getting a chance to talk to Ben Hints. He's the Brains behind Dwarf <span style="color:red" data-ts="16.545" data-end_ts="16.825" title="16.545" id=c_"16.545">__Craft__</span> devices, which is a pedal and modular maker, luckily kind of a stone's throw from my house. So I, I drove over this morning and, got a tour of the office and the plant here, and we went out for lunch. And now we're going to have a chance to talk a little bit about his experiences putting this, putting this company together and also some of his ideas about, the design for electronic instruments in effects. So, with that, I'm gonna say hi to <span style="color:red" data-ts="45.105" data-end_ts="45.265" title="45.105" id=c_"45.105">__Ben__</span>. Hate Ben, how's it going? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben Hinz (Dwarfcraft Devices): </b>Good. Thanks for coming. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, thanks for having me over. This has been really kind of interesting. It's been nice to, to kind of see, see the work in action. It's kind of cool to walk into the building and just like pedals and sinks and stuff everywhere. I mean, that's, that's like the kind of office I've always wished to work in, you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Know? Right. It's, it's a blessing and a curse <laugh>. 'cause when, when work is too demanding, then you just gotta walk past all this, all the, all the great benefits you've reaped. Right. And, you don't get to touch it. You 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Don't get to 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Enjoy anything. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So do you I that makes, that does make me ask, though, like, when you go home, do you still play? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>I didn't for a while. Yeah. And then, my band was, like recording and mixing for a long time, and then I think I like either got a new bass or something, so I basically went back to play and like my calluses were gone <laugh>. So like, the strings were freshly painful and I was like, oh, this, this will not fly. So <laugh>. So I brought a guitar home and like tucked it away in a, in a spot that's easy to, to get to and everything. So at least, and I, I do a lot of testing of the pedals, so Okay. I can at least keep, keep my calluses out. That's cool. That's cool. And, I mean, I, I do have the weekly band practice and sometimes another night a week too. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Nice. So, for people who aren't familiar with Dwarf <span style="color:red" data-ts="144.625" data-end_ts="144.905" title="144.625" id=c_"144.625">__Craft__</span>, why don't you fill us in on the variety of devices you make and, and, kinda what platforms you work with? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Okay. Well, the slogan that I started putting on our posters and things, a couple years ago is, new machines for New Music. The idea is that kind of leaves it open, you know, because I do love pedals and I use pedals a lot, but I, I'm <span style="color:red" data-ts="173.905" data-end_ts="174.025" title="173.905" id=c_"173.905">__a__</span>, I'm about making new sounds and new experiences, and so therefore new music. So we just try to be really, not necessarily experimental, but exploratory <span style="color:red" data-ts="188.995" data-end_ts="189.485" title="188.995" id=c_"188.995">__Alright__</span>. Right. With our, with our machines. I guess I don't really want to get a whole lot more specific than that, other than, I mean, I'd like to think you can go a little, a little further on our devices than you would with, you know, like a, a boss or something like that. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, the pedals that you made, I, I actually, the first time I interacted one was with a, I think we decided it was the Eau Claire Thunder was what it was called. Yeah. Yeah. And I remember it being sort of like, shockingly different sounding, you know, I, I happened to be in this thing where I was like comparing like five different pedals, Uhhuh <affirmative>, and it was like four versions of the same thing. Sure. And then this thing that was like, sort of like out <span style="color:red" data-ts="236.805" data-end_ts="236.925" title="236.805" id=c_"236.805">__of__</span> bounds 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b><laugh> <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Which was, which was your pedal. And I remember remarking at the time that it was, it, it actually felt like a really new sounding thing. But, the other, the other thing that you've done that I'm familiar with is the hacks <span style="color:red" data-ts="249.825" data-end_ts="250.045" title="249.825" id=c_"249.825">__Mm__</span>. Pedal, which was it sort of like played in that area between kind of effect and synth Tony kind of stuff. Sure, yeah. And I, I've seen a lot of people using that. That <span style="color:red" data-ts="261.285" data-end_ts="261.445" title="261.285" id=c_"261.285">__seemed__</span> to have been one of those that, that surfaces a lot. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Yeah. That was, I think that was maybe even our second pedal. Oh, really? Yeah. Oh, okay. It was real early on. It's not, not a lot of parts in it. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, it uses an obsolete chip from a telephone <laugh>. So we ended up buying a lot of those chips <laugh> a couple years back just in case <laugh>. Nice. Yeah. I mean, the first thing I ever made was a bank of square wave generators, Uhhuh <affirmative>. So, that tone out of the Hex, which is a, it's like a ring modulator, except it only generates one wave form. Right. And it's a, it's a real nasty square wave. So that was, that was still pretty comfortable territory Sure. For me at the time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So how did you, how did you get started? I mean, I, I mean, first of all, how did you get started doing electronic design work and, you know, kind of what was, when did you get kicked in? How did you get interested in electronics, but then also how did you get started deciding that you were gonna make a company out of it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>I mean, it all, it kind of comes back to, I guess the earliest point is just loving music, you know? And then, a friend of mine got the, propeller Heads Rebirth. Oh yeah. So then we were making electronic music, and then a few years later I, I learned a little bit about circuit bending and it looked really hard and a friend of mine was doing it, and he's like, no, it's easy. Like, just, just go for it. So I started circuit bending and a friend of mine, Casey Anderson, recommended a book by Nick Collins called Hardware Hacking. Right. And that's, that was when I got it just impenetrable. So, I just left the book in the bathroom and would just read the same page over and over until it made sense Uhhuh <affirmative>, and, you know, then eventually it starts coming faster. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Sure. And that's where, that's where I learned how to make that square wave generator. And I was, I thought I was making an overdrive that was in that book, but I had bought the wrong chip. So, through a lot of blood, sweat and tears that became the Great Destroyer, our first pedal. And so I was selling those just online to friends and a few locals. And I think somebody recommended the products to Sean at Analog Haven. Ah. And he was our first dealer and basically called me one day and was like, do you have anything else? And I think I had like two half done ideas at the time, and I was like, of course. And he said, okay, I'll take 10 of everything. And I had just lost my job in a kitchen at the time, Uhhuh <affirmative>. And from that moment on, it was a real company. Wow. It was a, I mean, it was a matter of survival at that time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You know what's funny is, is what you just said, there is actually two of the people who have, they have like a lot to answer for 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b><laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Nick Collins, Nick Collins, and Sean, and two people that, Nick gets people started on the path and Sean's gets the, is the person who hasn't turned it into a business to the right. The people. Yeah. It's amazing. That's pretty awesome. So what year was it that you, that you got, in contact with Sean? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>I'm pretty sure that was 2007, two or eight. The first thing I completed the, the square <span style="color:red" data-ts="509.005" data-end_ts="509.205" title="509.005" id=c_"509.005">__wave__</span> generators, was in 2007. Okay. And I only know that for sure because I put an unreasonably long serial number, <laugh> and date code on the, on the box. And, I probably wouldn't have remembered the date code because who has a date code, but, it's the same as, modern fender guitars. Oh, I see. So I was able to decipher the year <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So in addition to the Great Destroyer, what else were the first things that you <span style="color:red" data-ts="540.685" data-end_ts="540.885" title="540.685" id=c_"540.685">__sent__</span>, sent off to Shauna? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>So I'm guessing that was, the great destroyer hacks. The, the, the square wave generator was called the thumping double square snakes, <laugh>. And I was also working on sort of a tricked out feedback looper called the Hurricane. Okay. And, yeah, I think that was about it at that time. <span style="color:red" data-ts="568.005" data-end_ts="568.125" title="568.005" id=c_"568.005">__I__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, how long was it before you started like, seeing your work show up in like, people's work? Right. So one of the things I'd say is your stuff kind of sounds peculiar Yeah. Or particular. So I would think that, especially 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>That early stuff 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I would think that that would've kind of jumped out of a mixes for you anyway. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>It was sort of a strange, alternately slow burn and then some explosions here and there. Wow. <span style="color:red" data-ts="604.925" data-end_ts="605.045" title="604.925" id=c_"604.925">__I__</span>, Ellen Sparhawk and his bands are in Duluth, so that's like low retribution gospel choir. Right, right. So the gospel choir was playing here in Eau Claire. And I just, like, I came up to him after the set and was like, so I named this pedal after the low record, and, and I think he bought one right then and there, <laugh>. And then, and then he ordered some for like Christmas presents, basically for other people. And then I'm pretty sure the next time the black-eyed snakes played Eau Claire, the second guitar player in that group was using the, the Great Destroyer. But I guess most notably it, it wasn't long after that, that I asked our Japanese dealer to put us in touch with Boris. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and Toshi from Boris latched onto the Eau Claire Thunder right away. Yeah. And Wata, adopted the Shiva 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Uhhuh 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>And like those two pedals are, are still on their, on their boards. Wow. So unreal. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's pretty cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>That was, yeah. That's still a, still a feather in my cap <laugh>, I guess. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So you just, I mean, you just called him up blind and said, Hey, let's try and make this happen. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Well, the, our dealer <span style="color:red" data-ts="691.305" data-end_ts="691.525" title="691.305" id=c_"691.305">__ca__</span> in Japan said that he knew them. Oh, I see. Okay. In, in some way. So I sent, basically I just sent them presents. Right. And, you know, we've been doing business since then, you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Know. That's cool. So now you talk, you talked a little bit about your band. I'm thinking that that being part of a band, especially I think you identify, you kinda said it as like, it's a weird rock band. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Yeah. Like that. Yeah. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>My assumptions that that just doing that has to be, has to influence how you design stuff as well, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Absolutely. Yeah. I'm, I'm usually thinking about like in terms of interface and in terms of interface, I'm thinking about the stage. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And then for features, I'm thinking about studio. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Okay. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Because I, my creative time is probably 80% studio and 20% stage or even standing in the practice room. Right. But it's all, everything we've put out started as something that I wanted to use. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's really powerful though, because that's like a different, it means that you're, you're like, test your test group is a group of one Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b><laugh>, you have to 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Do it. You, you work on it until you are happy, I guess, right? Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b><affirmative>. And then, I mean, we're not very good about getting like early units out to people Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> to try. But now that we're collaborating with more, like freelance programmers and things like that, we have more, more heads in the game. <span style="color:red" data-ts="795.585" data-end_ts="795.805" title="795.585" id=c_"795.585">__Oh__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="795.805" data-end_ts="796.005" title="795.805" id=c_"795.805">__sure__</span>. During that stage of development and the next couple releases, we've, we've been able to sort of get out some, some early units to people while we could still make changes. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>But <span style="color:red" data-ts="809.045" data-end_ts="809.245" title="809.045" id=c_"809.045">__it__</span>, it is still a, a pretty small group. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So I, I'm curious about like how you go about designing something, because since you're, you're specifically, we're looking for new sounds and, and not necessarily something that is gonna fit an existing slot. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> in the quote the market, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, what is your design process? Where do you start? And how do you, how do you design the circuits? How do you, what do you test 'em against? Because one thing I know, I, I see your pedals often used by non guitarists. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, a lot of synth players use 'em Yeah. Particularly. And so I'm wondering how do you test it to make sure that it kind of works in all these different environments? What, what is the process you go through to make like from, gee, I think I might want to do something. What's the process? You go from there until you're done. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Okay. That's kind of a big question. It is a 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Big 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Question. Well, and, and it's because there are a number of processes Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But it always starts with a drawing on paper, which is where I start that that helps me organize my thoughts of, you know, feature set and interface simultaneously. So I draw a few versions of it, and then I sort of, if we have the enclosure that I want to use, or the front panel in the case of a module, I'll like, set the knobs on the face to kind of try to get an idea of the physics. And then it used to be I would just go to the breadboard and try to make it happen. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> in the case of our overdrive that we don't make anymore. It, it was all in my head. First it was like, oh, I, I'd like to try and overdrive. Okay, I wonder if we ran X, Y, and Z together and, you know, put a switch here and a knob here. I wonder if that would work. And then the next day I put it on the breadboard and it worked. And <laugh> a couple, you know, a couple weeks later we had the, the, the circuit board for it. Sure. Now, my ideas for circuits have far outstripped my abilities. I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>See. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>So I go to, Tom, the in-house engineer, well, first I, first I talk to Louise and be like, oh, I had this idea. And usually she's like, oh, that seems like a good idea. Or sometimes I have to convince her, or sometimes you just drop it right then and there. Okay. But then I go to Tom and I say, you know, I want A, B, C, D, E, FG. And, and then his job is basically to tell me, what we can do, what we can't do, and what we might be able to do. And then I basically just needle him until all, all the can and the maybes are done. Right. <laugh>. And then the newest process is, I'll go from a drawing and then maybe like a one page description, you know, further illustrating the capabilities of the device. And that gets, that gets sent off to software engineers. And we've got a, we've got a hardware platform now that we can, it's really versatile. We can load a lot of different, programs into it. So as of maybe a couple weeks ago, I've started prototyping things on my like 10-year-old laptop. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. We're yet to see how difficult it's gonna be to, to translate the one format to another. But Tom says, we definitely can do it <laugh>. Nice. So I'm, I'm taking that as a, as a yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So how, for yourself, how hard was it to give up doing the actual hardware design? Because first of all, I would assume that there was a lot of like, there was a sense of accomplishment Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> by designing it yourself, but also I would think that you would've had like the happy, happy accident things happen sometimes that uhhuh <affirmative> that made for sort of like the signature device, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Yeah. I mean, I don't, I don't miss it really. Yeah. When we're, when we're working on something new, I get to do so much of the imagining uhhuh and then the testing and, you know, I, I get to do kind of the best parts of it. Like, I was never really attached to the, the mechanics. I feel like I, I'm one of only a few people in the industry who doesn't give a shit one way or another. If it's accomplished digitally or with analog. Like, I'm about seeing a great thing, a great opportunity, and making it real uhhuh <span style="color:red" data-ts="1121.885" data-end_ts="1121.925" title="1121.885" id=c_"1121.885">__<affirmative>__</span> with the exception of distortion, which you just can't seem to be able to do at a computer <laugh> in a convincing way. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Why that is, that is funny you say that, but that does seem to be the case. That's the one thing you can't pull out somehow. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1135.045" data-end_ts="1135.165" title="1135.045" id=c_"1135.045">__A__</span> a couple years ago I had <span style="color:red" data-ts="1136.905" data-end_ts="1137.125" title="1136.905" id=c_"1136.905">__shi__</span> basically shipped all my gear out to the NAMM Show. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and my wife and I were playing together and none of my stuff had come back yet. And I was like, oh, no problem. Like, we're just writing a song, like I'll just hook up this, the line six and Oh 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Right. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>And everything, there's so much great stuff in those pedals. And then I was like, I just need a distortion. And I went through all of them and I just hated them all. <laugh>. Right. And like, I couldn't even, yeah. I don't know, like there's, there's some amp simulators and stuff, especially in logic that I like a lot, but nothing, I'm never played a digital distortion in a stomp box that tripped my trigger. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I, I'm with you there. That's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Okay. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I think it's kind of interesting though, because an awful lot of people that have gone through the path that you've taken, they can't give up on the design or on the doing part, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But I think it, it actually sounds like you have kind of a cool, you get to imagine the front end and then you get to play with the back end. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And for you, how often is it different and how often is it even better than you thought on the front end? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>It's almost always different, and it's usually better really, like, especially working in the, in the digital domain, like, up until recently I hadn't really explored that at all except in like, making electronic music. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> on the computer. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1233.845" data-end_ts="1233.965" title="1233.845" id=c_"1233.845">__you__</span> know, so the, in that case, just the sky's the limit and like, I'll put things together where the cost of the patch cables alone would break me. Right. You know, so that, that thought process never really came into pedal design. But when working with Emmett, that's our, our freelancer in Boston and Tom, they can see, you know, sort of what's left in the processor, different ways to maximize the hardware. And they, they contribute a lot of great bits and bobs. So my, my germ of an idea becomes a much, much better thing at the end of the day. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Now, to me, to get to the point where you're, what you call the imagining the Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> the kind of conceptualization of what you're going to put together as a product. I mean, it sort of, it implies that you have kind of a very personal view of where electronics fit in the music making process. And you drop little nuggets about like having done electronic music, <laugh>, you know, or being in these rock band things Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> or, you know, playing around writing songs or whatever. And I'd like to hear a little bit more just about where you, how you think of music and electronics and kind of the, the mashup of that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Okay. So I, for a long time I've just, I've had feelings on that subject. And I was never really able to verbalize them until a couple years ago. I saw Bonnie Bear and they played their newest album Start to Finish, which is, it's mostly electronic, but like all the vocals and horns and, and guitars and everything, like, everything on that stage, everything on that album has like equal importance and weight Uhhuh <affirmative>. And I was like, that's exactly what I've been feeling is like just a UA unified system of music. Like there's the, the boxes and, and lines that we've put around things are arbitrary. And so I'm, I'm big, I'm big into integration of different, not even necessarily genres, but I guess tools, instruments. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's, it's funny you say that because it seems like, and maybe this is just me giving too much benefit <span style="color:red" data-ts="1397.865" data-end_ts="1398.085" title="1397.865" id=c_"1397.865">__of__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1398.085" data-end_ts="1398.125" title="1398.085" id=c_"1398.085">__the__</span> doubt to the internet <laugh>, but it seems like the second that there's, the opportunity for opinion or Division <laugh> is gonna happen. Oh yeah. And so, like, one of the things you see right now is sort of like this differentiation between what guitar and bass players could do, and EDM and the two of them can't occupy the same continent Right. At the same time, let alone share musical influences or anything like that. Right. How, how does what you're saying survive in an environment that doesn't seem willing <laugh> to integrate? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Oh, man, that's a, that's another big question. I mean, I agree with you. Like we're a tribal species, right? And whatever, whatever team you're rooting for or you know, side of of music you're on, people tend to rally behind that. But I've seen a lot of, a lot of musicians over the years who, you know, started experimenting with guitars and feedback and everything like that move into Euro Rack, you know, and that's almost exclusively where they, where they create. Now, <laugh>, we watched, men in Black recently. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, Tommy Lee Jones says, says, no, a person is smart, people are stupid, confused, whatever, whatever, <laugh>. Right? And, and I think that's, that's, that's how we survive in that when people aren't thinking about their team or, you know, when they're, when they're focused on creating, a lot of those lines can go away, I think, and especially for, for Dwarf <span style="color:red" data-ts="1509.645" data-end_ts="1509.845" title="1509.645" id=c_"1509.645">__Craft__</span> in particular, like, we've always kind of been on the outskirts of whatever genre we were associated with. So I think that makes for a more natural leap and a more inclusive, workflow. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. But then on the other hand, doesn't it sometimes put you in a weird position of, you know, I always think of like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1534.825" data-end_ts="1535.045" title="1534.825" id=c_"1534.825">__oh__</span>, this is gonna be a crazy diversion, but 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Let's, let's do it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Let's do it. So you, if you have a family, I, I think of my, I think of my cousins, they were four boys, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And the first one was pretty wild. And so the second, in order to outdo 'em, <laugh> at the end of, you know, so by the time it <span style="color:red" data-ts="1554.525" data-end_ts="1554.685" title="1554.525" id=c_"1554.525">__got__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1554.685" data-end_ts="1554.885" title="1554.685" id=c_"1554.685">__to__</span> the fourth kid, it was like, straight to prison, please, <laugh>, you know? Is there, how, how do you keep like one upping your own self in order to sort of like stay on the edge? Because you are, I mean, you're, you're right in saying that you're kind of stake in the ground is like on the very edge of sanity, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And, but isn't that a constantly changing, border, and how do you make sure that you're out there? Or is it just such a personal experience that it's gonna be that no matter what? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>The, I guess, in that respect, I'm lucky because the places my heart and head go are they, they tend to stay out of the norm for the most part. And, I guess what we've been focusing a lot lately, focusing on a lot lately is just sort of maximizing the technology available to us. And I like, I don't mean like commercially available, available meaning like things that we can understand enough to work with. Oh, sure. You know, like, obviously somebody knows how to make that computer there, which is the world's best sampler. Synthesizer or whatever you want it to be. But that's, you know, that's not where we work. And so just the way I interpret those possibilities tends to keep us a little on the edge. And it's actually, it, a bigger concern is when we say, okay, with the exception of like the granular stuff that is just, it starts outside and it stays outside 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1676.525" data-end_ts="1676.805" title="1676.525" id=c_"1676.525">__Like__</span> when we're, so we're working on a phaser right now, and like I had to go to, Emmett and ask him to, to change a few things on this and be like, man, I love this. We're still gonna be able to do all the fucked up things we wanna do with it, but we gotta be able to quickly and easily dial it back to Pink Floyd. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, right. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>And again, he's great at his job, so it was done the next day. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Well, but that's, it's interesting because it might, it would be really easy to just say, well, I just live way out on, on the fringe here. So let's just focus on that. But being able, you know, that's maybe where some of your experience too as a player really comes in, comes in handy too. Now, I'm curious about something you mentioned before, which was, you said it that you're, not so much experimental as exploratory. What do you think is the difference between those two things? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And why would you pause it that 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Way? <laugh>. I guess the, the reason that those words came out that way, is because, shoot, before I really started making anything, there was sort of an experimental music explosion here. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Here meaning 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>In Eau Claire? In Eau Claire. Yeah. And, so that alternately became like a buzzword and also a dirty word depending on who was saying it. And it got to a point where we'd go to play a show and I'd just be like, this is not experimental. Like, we know exactly what's gonna happen. Like, we wrote this song Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know, it was, that was at the point when it got the word experimental was being thrown around in a, in a detrimental way. And so when I say the pedals are, or the process is exploratory rather than experimental, is that, I guess when it's done, when it's done, we're pretty sure of its capabilities. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And we've explored the possibilities and, and taken a lot of things out. Whereas I feel something like square snakes, which was just, you know, bank of of square wave oscillators was a bit more experimental because I didn't know didly squat about it. And actually a lot of 'em went out without capacitors at the end, which means they were just blasting raw voltage wherever they went, <laugh>, which in general is fine because anything you plug it into is gonna have an input cap. But, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> still <laugh> you were the run running around with your hair on <span style="color:red" data-ts="1842.325" data-end_ts="1842.605" title="1842.325" id=c_"1842.325">__Final__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b><laugh>, I guess. Yeah. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's, that's really interesting. That's a cool take on it. So now you also mentioned kind of watching people and sound creative, creative sound artists. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> kind of moving from guitars to Eurorack. Do you think that they're just walking away from guitar or is eurorack like added into the mix? Or 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Guess is it just a change in focus in some, in the music, or what do you thinks? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Well, so the, the people that I'm referencing are usually not, you know, touring. They're, they're day job people who experiment with their gear at home or in a practice space or whatever. And that can be really fun with the guitar. But I, I think the appeal of that Euro <span style="color:red" data-ts="1893.805" data-end_ts="1893.925" title="1893.805" id=c_"1893.805">__rack__</span> system in that specific environment, and I'm, I'm speaking from experience here too, like I've gigged that system once or twice. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, there's a lot of unexplored territory in really any rack you put together. And so you're kind of, you're, you're automatically, collaborating with the machine and trying to, maybe trying to communicate some feeling or something. I just think it, it taps right into that, that personal creative space. And at least for me, a lot of times, unless, you know, the gear set up is pretty expansive, playing guitar on your own can sound pretty naked and, and lonely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, the other thing is, if you're doing it with guitar, eventually you get to a point of frustration saying that I could, I could experiment more if I had better facility on the instrument. Sure. There's not really like any value in being really fast at patching cables in. Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1961.765" data-end_ts="1961.965" title="1961.765" id=c_"1961.765">__No__</span>. So it's sort of like pulls you away from focusing on being fast on the instrument. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Which 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1967.325" data-end_ts="1967.365" title="1967.325" id=c_"1967.325">__Just__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1967.365" data-end_ts="1967.485" title="1967.365" id=c_"1967.365">__made__</span> you kind of 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Cool your finger coordination. Right? Yeah. It does. It almost, it almost forces you to, to slow down and take the focus outta your finger tricks. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So now I'm looking around, we're, we're recording this in, in Ben's office and I'm looking around and it's kind of a place of amazing bits and Bobs <laugh>, you know, Simon, here with one elbow on an Octa <span style="color:red" data-ts="1995.285" data-end_ts="1995.525" title="1995.285" id=c_"1995.285">__track__</span> looking at a, at a tac cassette deck. Dual well cassette deck <laugh>. There's, there's a rack of a six, six u looks like about a dual 84. I think that's the maybe 90. That's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>The Pittsburgh move case. Oh, okay. Which I think is 1 0 4. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>1 0 4, okay. But then there's a couple of other, there's a tiptop happy Innings rack, there's a couple of half <span style="color:red" data-ts="2022.845" data-end_ts="2023.165" title="2022.845" id=c_"2022.845">__filled__</span> racks. There's <laugh>, there's everything, there's, there's breadboards up in the corner, there's everything it seems like. And 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>The 66 Coronado and the 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>66 <span style="color:red" data-ts="2033.565" data-end_ts="2033.885" title="2033.565" id=c_"2033.565">__Corona__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>That was, that was my wife taking a huge gamble on me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Wow. With the beauty Bigsby. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2042.285" data-end_ts="2042.485" title="2042.285" id=c_"2042.285">__had__</span> that myself. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, did you? Oh yeah. Nice. Awesome. Well, you have, you have chosen to surround yourself with an amazing pile of stuff of all of this. When you're just in a mood, what's the thing that you pick up and play? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Oh boy. I mean, it's, it's still usually a guitar. Yeah. Just 'cause I have such an immediate command of it Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> not, not in a virtuo or sense or anything like that, but just I can pick it up and I can play notes and I can make it speak how I feel. Right. Right away. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>When I get down to create, like with any kind of purpose, I kind of tend to put together a unique rig for that time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, interesting. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2096.955" data-end_ts="2097.245" title="2096.955" id=c_"2096.955">__Well__</span> that's cool. Well, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2099.245" data-end_ts="2099.365" title="2099.245" id=c_"2099.245">__and__</span> and you certainly would have kind of the tooling around here to do it. Don't <laugh>. Now you've, you've gone from doing just pedals. You've been doing more Euro rack stuff. Yeah. And, and you're, I think you're expanding on that too, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>That is the plan. Yeah. We've got the great destroyer, the hacks and the little 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. For people who aren't familiar. Great. Destroyer is what? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>It's an oscillating fuzz. Okay. Rhythmically oscillating. Okay. And the hacks, which is a nasty sort of ring mod. Right. And then we also make the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2136.985" data-end_ts="2137.205" title="2136.985" id=c_"2136.985">__Yep__</span>. Which is, basically one slow square wave that turns on a bank of square wave generators. Okay. Some people have called it a burst generator. Ah, alright. But I'm not, I'm not sure the technical specs on calling it that, so. Sure. So I don't always call it that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And now what is, what are some of the things that you're working on that you can talk about? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Okay. The, the next release is slated to be our, happiness pedal, in just, it's the same circuit board with, a modular face plate over it. Oh, okay. So that, that pedal is, was designed to run on the bipolar 12 volt power supply. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. And what does it do? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>It's a multi-mode filter and with <span style="color:red" data-ts="2194.205" data-end_ts="2194.325" title="2194.205" id=c_"2194.205">__a__</span> built-in LFO and sample and hold. Okay. So yeah, luckily the volume levels worked out. Oh, sure. And it, yeah, we don't have to 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's a natural, huh? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Yeah. Yeah. All we have to do is not convert the power and put a different face on it and basically it's a, it's a module. Sure. And then, we're also working on like an LFOA dual LFO that you can sort of modulate the, the frequencies on those LFOs either with each other or another control voltage. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2228.955" data-end_ts="2229.245" title="2228.955" id=c_"2228.955">__That__</span> dual LFO thing is always such an entrancing game. <laugh>, you get 'em where they influencing each other uhhuh and stuff. So it always seems like that's, that's like one of those things, whenever I start going down that path, I can like blow an afternoon. Right. <laugh> Sure. It's like, just like having 'em, having 'em like dance with each other. It's always, it's always good for some 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Fun. Well that's the, that's the core of our tremolo pedal. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> our recently discontinued tremolo pedal. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So when you discontinue products, why do you, I mean, is it just that parts become unavailable or do you just get tired of like how 'em out there or? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>A lot of, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I've always been curious. Okay. Yeah. 'cause it's sort of like, you know, once the design's there Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, why not just keep on sending 'em out the door or, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Right. So every pedal has a unique build for the enclosure. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know, even if they're the same size and they have the same holes drilled in <span style="color:red" data-ts="2287.245" data-end_ts="2287.405" title="2287.245" id=c_"2287.245">__them__</span>, it's a different image printed on it. Right. You know, so that, that's a unique part. And it's usually the most expensive part of the pedal. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2296.365" data-end_ts="2296.565" title="2296.365" id=c_"2296.365">__Oh__</span>. So, and that's, you know, that's not a, a make or break thing. I mean, pedals, at least for us forever have had an initial burst of sales and then usually it tapers off and plateaus, uhhuh, and eventually tapers off one more time. Sure. Okay. And then it's kind of done. Yeah. And there's stuff like, like, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So that's sort of the universe telling you Yeah. We can put this on away now, huh? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Yeah. And like, honestly, like when the first batch ships like, and everything works, like I'm satisfied, I'm done. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> like, I'm, you know, if, if we don't have to sell it then, you know, I guess that's more time for me to use it. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>Sure. Which is never true 'cause I always work out the next thing, but the, the, the principle's the same. Like it's always gonna be here for me. Right. Like I was, I was gigging like the second to final prototype of the twin stags tremolo and when we decided to discontinue it, I was, I was just like, oh, Louise, I don't have a real one of those <laugh>. And she's like, go, well go get one now. Go 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Get one now. <laugh>. Yeah. It's hilarious. Well hey man, I want to thank you so much for taking the time to talk. This is a lot of fun. And thanks for the tour of the place. It was great. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2382.665" data-end_ts="2382.885" title="2382.665" id=c_"2382.665">__Oh__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ben: </b>You bet. Thanks for 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Coming and thanks for sharing some of your, some of your ideas and insights. 'cause I think that that kind of helps to people understand, where you're coming from. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2391.385" data-end_ts="2391.805" title="2391.385" id=c_"2391.385">__Sounds__</span> great.

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Many thanks to Ben for hanging out, showing me around dwarf <span style="color:red" data-ts="2411.525" data-end_ts="2411.845" title="2411.525" id=c_"2411.525">__craft__</span> and talking about a lot of stuff. Particularly the design process for making their incredible pedals. If you haven't had a chance to try any of their stuff, particularly the Eau Claire Thunder, which is one of my favorite distortion overdrive pedals ever. If you haven't had a chance to try 'em out, take the opportunity, opportunity to do it. It's well worth your effort. I want to thank you the listeners again for continuing to listen. Keep it up, keep on sharing this with your friends and we'll catch you next week <span style="color:red" data-ts="2443.285" data-end_ts="2443.525" title="2443.285" id=c_"2443.285">__round__</span>.
