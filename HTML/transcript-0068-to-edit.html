<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. This week I have, the tremendous pleasure of introducing you to somebody that, I've actually kind of followed for a while, very, Lish. But my friend Mike Matley kind of keyed me into the fact that, hey, he'd be up for a chat. And so, I reached out to Herman Pearl Now, I'm not sure that many of you know who her Herman Pearl might be, but if I say that Herman Pearl is also known by the name of Soy Sauce, many of you probably do know who I'm talking about. I followed him his discussions for a while on Muff <span style="color:red" data-ts="45.92" data-end_ts="46.32" title="45.92" id=c_"45.92">__Wiggler__</span>, but also, I, follow him on Facebook and I've gotten an opportunity to see him talk about, a really full life. He, in a recent Facebook posting, he listed himself as a sound designer slash artist slash engineer, comma producer slash dj slash musician. And he works with his wife Stacy, who's a choreographer of visual artist. So, from what I can tell, we have all media arts covered <laugh>. And with that, I'll, welcome Herman to the, to the podcast. Hi, Herman. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman "Soy Sos" Pearl: </b>Hey. Hey, Darwin How you doing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm all right. Thanks for being willing to, willing to chat with us. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Yeah, yeah. I'm a, I'm a big fan of the podcast. <span style="color:red" data-ts="88.08" data-end_ts="88.2" title="88.08" id=c_"88.08">__I__</span> love 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It. Oh, fantastic. Well, that's good news. So why don't we kick this off by having, you tell people what it means when, when we kind of have this really broad set of, things that you do. Why don't you kind of fill us in on what that looks like on a day-to-day basis? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Yeah, sure. Well, so I operate, operate a recording studio that's called <span style="color:red" data-ts="110.33" data-end_ts="110.68" title="110.33" id=c_"110.33">__Tough__</span> Sound. It's spelled like the Marley, t u f f sound recording. Right. And so I do that on kind of a daily basis, and I work with a lot of hip hop artists mainly, and then fill in with all variety of, you know, other sound duties that people need. I do sound design with my wife's dance company, which is called Stacey Pearl Dance Project. I freelance dj, and then just, you know, kind of a gun for hire for whatever, whatever else people need. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. And, you also, well, it's funny because you say you dj, but when I see pictures of your DJ rig, it looks like you're kind of have a Ableton <span style="color:red" data-ts="151.96" data-end_ts="152.2" title="151.96" id=c_"151.96">__like__</span> setup. Is, do you, do you do sort of that creative Ableton based DJ stuff, or do you just do spinning of records in more typical fashion? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Yeah. Well, I, I started DJing initially with vinyl. And I don't do vinyl much anymore unless people are asking me to do like an all jazz set or something like that. Something more like, or maybe like Roots reggae. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. But then when I, I, I, I switched to Serato years ago and I was doing that, and then I recently got into, tractor. So I think I'm, I'm switching to Tractor. <span style="color:red" data-ts="186.15" data-end_ts="186.44" title="186.15" id=c_"186.15">__Yeah__</span>. And I also have a, a set that I developed in Ableton, but that requires so much prep per file that I think I'm gonna kind of transition that thing to Tractor 'cause it's sort of a lot easier to do what it is that I want to do. And I think the Ableton thing is almost overkill. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. Interesting. Now, doing sound design for dance company, as my listeners will know, I, fiddle around with the local dance company a fair bit. But, because you are working with your partner on this, obviously you're probably much more engaged in it than I am <laugh>. What does, what is sound design for a dance company? What, what is that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Well, it varies. A lot of times when I, when I first moved to the house that we're in now years ago, I got connected in with the dance community here before I met my wife. And so I did kind of whatever manner of things people needed. Sometimes people would require, you know, custom things to be recorded, and sometimes they would need songs edited to accommodate, you know, the arrangements that they needed. But with Stacy, we do anything from, she may develop a new work using, using non-original music, using songs Right. From other artists. And then in some cases we'll keep those songs, but what we prefer to do is to create original content. And I've kind of been on this thing about using songs too much because I almost usually feel that, especially stuff with lyrics tends to be so kind of specific and evocative that it can be a distraction from the expression of, of the dance. You know what I mean? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, that's, it's interesting you say that because certainly in my work, I do both visuals and audio with this dance company, the, third law dance company here in Boulder. And one of the things I'm constantly working on doing is finding ways to not distract from the person on stage, because especially doing visuals, but also with audio, it's really easy to, to make it so that it's like about me. And I have to keep on remembering that it's not, it's about the dancer. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Yeah. And I, I've, and I've also often found with visuals that a lot of times, you know, your average dancer is five and a half feet tall. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> and visuals can tend to go all the way up to, you know, 20 feet in the air. Right. And that, that can make it really hard to, you know, to, to focus on the, on the, dance because you've got just this weird height discrepancy. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, sure. Right. Exactly. Well then you also have the issue more in reversal, I guess, but, depending on how improvisational it is, you can also have the problem of the dancers sort of like watching the screen instead of doing their own thing. Right, right. Which, that gets a little troubling as well. My goodness. You do a lot of stuff and, and I think you're actually being a little, a little shy about blurting out everything, because when you sent me a little bit of bio information, I mean, you've, you've scored films, you've done, you've done touring work, you work with, you work as sort of, what you call being a kind of a pitch <span style="color:red" data-ts="386.38" data-end_ts="386.6" title="386.38" id=c_"386.38">__man__</span> for, Pittsburgh Modular. You have got a lot of irons in the fire. It's really pretty amazing. My question to you is, what was your background like that puts you in a position to be able to be, have high levels of expertise in all this stuff? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Well, so I think the, the joke that I put on the site is that my first, my first I guess audio tool was a tape recorder at maybe eight or eight or 10 years old, and sort of quickly became obsessed with that. So I just used to play around with that little cassette recorder all the time and, you know, make my own little audio plays. And in fact, I even snuck it into Star Wars <laugh>, when it came out and bootleg the audio of the entire movie. So that was like an early <laugh> nice mobile recording experience. I think I'm, I think I'm protected by the, statute of limitations on that. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, I think so. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>But yeah, that, I, I went to the, I'm from Pittsburgh and I live in Pittsburgh still. So I went to the Pittsburgh, creative and performing arts high school, and that was just like an incredible, you know, mishmash of, jazz and funk musicians and young rockers and stuff like that. And we actually had a, an electronic music, class that had an <span style="color:red" data-ts="459.2" data-end_ts="459.32" title="459.2" id=c_"459.2">__R__</span> 2,600, which I actually ended up with. I ended up being given that by the music department years later. So I did that and I, I studied guitar and percussion there, and I think that I don't, I just kind of feel like maybe it is that I'm not satisfied doing one thing and also based on kind of, economics, you have to, you know, it's, it's difficult to be, to only do one thing in the arts and have that be your job, right. And be able to survive. You know what I mean? Sure, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. There's a certain amount of, I would say, of the things that you do, there's a certain amount where you have to attain a high level of skill, and then there's also a certain amount where you just have to have the onions to say, I'm doing this. Right. Yeah. And I think that there's, I think that you actually are involved in a lot of those things. I mean, being, being running a recording studio and on, you know, being involved in working on recording projects, you have to have a certain level of technical skill. And that's the kind of things that, you know, you can study or you can work hard at achieving those through trial and error. Right. But at some point you have to have, you know, the balls to say, yeah, I'm good at this. Come and pay me to do it. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Yeah. I, I think so. Yeah. <laugh>, I mean, <span style="color:red" data-ts="540.84" data-end_ts="541" title="540.84" id=c_"540.84">__it__</span>, I mean, I think Mo Mo most audio engineers are, a lot of audio engineers are people that started recording to, you know, to document their own stuff. Right. And then ended up, you know, ended up just having friends come over and, you know, gradually just building up a clientele to, to do it. So, and, and, and I, I definitely am one of those type of people. Although when I graduated high school, I ended up out on the road with a band that kind of imploded in California, and I ended up in, Portland in the early eighties. And I did find a community college that had a really good recording program. So I did that for two years. But I just took the amount of classes that I, that was necessary just to get, to get those, to get those classes. I didn't, I didn't get any kind of a degree. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Got it. You know what I mean? Yeah. I, I do. That's that's interesting. But it's also, it makes me curious a little bit more. So you went on the road, what did you, what was your instrument? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>So this is kind of funny, but, when I, there was a tour that came through Pittsburgh, that was sponsored by the Youth International Party called Rock Against Reagan. Okay. And, it was, bad, the Bad Brains were actually the band that was, that was like kind of the, the touring band that, that was like rolling with that thing. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>And there was all kind of problems with that. And I think what happened was, the story is that the roadie, their roadie, whose name was Alvin, talked to some people in our band. It was a band called Stick Against Stone, that I had joined when I was in, when I was in high school, I saw this band and I wanted to be part of it. It was a really cool band. They had like five woodwind players, like, you know, saxes and, and clarinet and stuff like the baritone sax and two drummers. They were, they were really weird band, but a lot of those people fell off to the side and ended up being a five piece band with guitar. I was the first guitarist in that band. Oh, okay. And we somehow got, we somehow got thrown into being the, the touring band for this thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>And, it was just a mess. It was like crazy. And <laugh>, I wish someone had documented it, but, the band just got out and we did all these dates. We actually played with the Dead Kennedys in Dolores Park in San Francisco, and, the Minutemen in la and it was, it was really just chaotic, but the, the people involved in the group, there were some very crazy people. And it, and I was just, I was just 18 years old, so Right. I was like the youngest person on, we lived on a school bus with two dogs and eight people <laugh>. It was a nightmare. I mean, it's, it was a, it was a real character shaping <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Yeah. That's, that's one way of putting it. Character shaping. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>I'm glad, I'm glad for the experience, but Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'll bet. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>So, yeah, so we, we, the bus just kind of kept heading north and we ended up in Portland, and, that was great for us. You know, it was great for me and a drummer. I just ended up, you know, finding this, this recording program there. And, you know, things were way chilled out from that point. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. But at some point you came back to Pittsburgh, and I'm actually <span style="color:red" data-ts="718.08" data-end_ts="718.28" title="718.08" id=c_"718.08">__kind__</span> of curious about this because, in my experience, people who are artists tend to have to leave home in order to achieve any sort of like, professional success, right? Mm-hmm. <affirmative> that, something about being an artist where you grew up is really difficult, right. But you have found yourself back from once you came, which is really cool. And also it means that, you know, you have a, a much deeper and rooted connection to the community than somebody who just sort of blows in, into town. Now, Pittsburgh, I think, is a smaller, you know, is definitely a smaller environment than, a lot of the big and what we would consider art cities. Right. Right. But, it sounds to me like you have sort of, you know, gouged out a way for you to have your fingers in a lot of stuff. How important do you think it is to, to be, and I'll use this phrase to be home, to do the things that you're doing, and to what extent does that maybe get in the way? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Well, I think the thing about Pittsburgh is definitely on the come <span style="color:red" data-ts="794.16" data-end_ts="794.32" title="794.16" id=c_"794.16">__up__</span>, and it's actually kind of like Portland in the nineties mm-hmm. <affirmative> in a way. I mean, that's kind of the joke around here. 'cause it's, it's the thing about, it's, it's, it's still affordable to live. And the arts community has really grown. I mean, even just since Stacey moved here in early, you know, around 2000, like the dance scene has, has really come up and, and she's actually a big part of what's made the dance scene special here. But I think it's, yeah, it's one of those things where you kind of suck it up and, and having <span style="color:red" data-ts="824.47" data-end_ts="824.76" title="824.47" id=c_"824.47">__miss__</span>, you know, missing out on, on some of the bigger city types of things. And she was definitely going crazy when she first got here from New York 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Because, 'cause it, it is, it is very small time, and there's like two degrees of separation with everybody. But it is also good in the way that it's easier to meet the people that you need to meet so you can form your own crew. You know what I mean? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Do. Yeah. Like, you can, you can, you can find, and, and you can, and you can contact people much more easily. It's not so much like in New York. I mean, although I, you know, I love New York and I love working in New York, but, you can find like the people that you need to find pretty easily and figure out relatively quickly whether it's gonna be a good fit or not. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Sure. Now, Pittsburgh, I, I've heard this about Pittsburgh, that it's really on the come, a friend of mine, is living there now, and she's kind of been filling me in on, you know, you've got, you've got new galleries opening up <span style="color:red" data-ts="879.7" data-end_ts="879.92" title="879.7" id=c_"879.7">__in__</span> new, exhibit spaces, Carnegie Mellon's out of there somewhere, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Yeah. And, and 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>They're blowing up with, with the kind of things they're doing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Yeah. And actually, interestingly enough, the building that our dance studio is in, also C M U has the whole fourth floor. They've been there for years, and they're running this, this sort of theater tech, program out of that space. Sure. Okay. And, and I'm, and I'm actually right on the cusp of signing a lease to move my studio to that building as well. So I see it's one of those kind of places, like, you know, not every every city has that, but, you know, like Brooklyn, way back in the day used to be that kind of thing where you could have a loft space somewhere that would be under the radar. I mean, it's still like that around here to a certain extent, but it's, it's changing. You know what I mean? There's a lot of new development, so 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. You have to be stealthy. Yeah. I, I think that it's, it's kinda interesting because yeah, with big or populous cities now that just, that just can't even happen. Anything that even gets a little bit hip, first of all gets regulated to the teeth and secondly becomes so unaffordable that you have to have a stockbroker in a family in order to afford it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Yeah. And, and, and the thing is I've said is like, we, we want to have the kind of life where we don't have to pay insane prices for space or drive insane distances to get to where we want to go. So, I mean, right now where we live on the east end, you know, our, our space is eight blocks away. I can ride my bike there. You know what I mean? Sure. And, and, and from, for right now, my studio's in the house. So, you know, there's many days that go by where I don't have to drive <laugh>. And I, and I, and I think that's a really, you know, that's, it's just like we have to choose the kind of life that we want. And I really decided that New York is not the place to do that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>I used to have a, a, a, a partnership with a, with a DJ producer there, and we did a lot of house records in the early two thousands, late nineties. And, you know, I just love going there and working. I love doing stuff. I love the club scene, and I love the diversity. You know, it can, it can tend to be a little bit homogenous around here sometimes if you're not careful. Right. But I always found like every time I would go there to work, the logistics, that we would have to be dealing with in order just to, you know, get gear into this place and park the car there, it's just, it's insane, you know? Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I think I'd like to explore this concept of being sort of an artist in a small city a little more, because I actually think that, you know, I, I have a lot of listeners in New York and LA and San Francisco, but I have a ton of listeners all over and in a lot of smaller cities as well. And I think everybody would like to say, this sounds great. This sounds like an opportunity. Here's a person who is kind of mapped out, something that, you know, maybe could look like what my life could look like. How long did it take you to get to the point where you felt like, like you had your community kind of clocked, and how much did you have to be like super marketing guy in order to pull that off? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Well, I think for the studio, I mean, I've literally been building the studio for probably 25 years. So, and, and, and as far as marketing, the thing that I've done is just to try to do the best work possible. I really haven't advertised, it's really just been networking and referrals that have, like, that have powered that thing. Although with the idea of moving the studio, I definitely wanna put a new push on just up upgrade, you know, upgrading the message a bit, you know? Right. But yeah, I think with the studio, it's just been grinding it out and there's obviously no security <laugh>, you know, because Right. You could hit a slow month. I mean, January was pretty slow. Yeah. February's going well, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1119.83" data-end_ts="1120.12" title="1119.83" id=c_"1119.83">__this__</span> end of December is always a little slow, so you have to, you know, you just have to keep pushing and, sometimes work on projects that you don't love. Sure. But, but you know, in, in that way, always try to find something about the project that you can, that can feed you. You know what I mean? Even if it's just finding an awesome new way to clean up breaths or Right. You know, or line up, line up doubles or something like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, so, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Well, but I didn't, so what you were saying about, about your question about being in a small town. Yeah. I think it's, yeah, I think it's, it's awesome. I think there's sometimes the frustration of some of certain projects that don't reach outside of the city, and the desire to sort of have your works seen by more people. So when they do, like the, the house music stuff that I was doing, it was a group called Three Generations Walking. Okay. That stuff had like a really great world worldwide, profile to it, and it was kind of very much known in the deep house scene in New York, like in Body and Soul and parties like that. So kind of when you have a taste of that, there's sort of this, you know, bratty entitlement where you're sort of like, yeah, that's awesome. I, I want my work to be, to be known around the world. And then sometimes you're working on projects that are not known around the world, and, and there's like a bit of a frustration or a longing, you know what I mean? Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I get that. Now, the other thing, way back when, when dinosaurs still roamed the earth mm-hmm. <laugh>, I was a co-owner of a recording studio, in Texas, and it was a small town near, near Dallas. We did a lot of work with sort of like the Texas punk scene. It was pretty awesome. Oh, wow. Yeah. But, one of the things I noticed is that there was a tendency among people to say, you know, this is, this is all good and fine. I'm glad I can do this work here, but, you know, the second that I get more money or I get some sort of a deal or whatever, I'm gonna go to the big city to do my work. Do you run into that a lot? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>For me personally or for people that I'm working with? For 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>People that you're working with? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Yeah. I mean, I, I do so much work in the rap field. Yeah. So a lot of that is, you know, aspirational kinds of songs about making it and rolling high and all that kind of stuff. Sure. And it's just funny to, to a certain extent over the years, you just get numb to that because you hear the same, you know, you hear the same sort of, desires in terms of wealth. Right. And then you see a lot of those people go nowhere anyway. Yeah. And people are, and a lot of people will sometimes jokingly say, you know, when I make it, I'm <span style="color:red" data-ts="1288.96" data-end_ts="1289.08" title="1288.96" id=c_"1288.96">__gonna__</span>, I'm gonna bring you with me <laugh>. And I just, I always say, yeah, sure. I mean, we have a, we have a kid that's actually from Pittsburgh named Mac Miller, who is a former client of mine, and he was a high school student when he worked with me for about two and a half, three years. Okay. And he is now huge. So he's like really in that way, like in terms of the hip hop game, he's like the one Right. That rose to the highest heights. And of course, he's living in LA now and doesn't do much, much work in the city at all. You <span style="color:red" data-ts="1316.88" data-end_ts="1316.92" title="1316.88" id=c_"1316.88">__know__</span> what I mean? Sure. Right, right. But I'm not, I'm not mad at that. I mean, I understand, you know what I mean? It makes more sense to be where he is. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, yeah. Well, and I think a lot of times in, in those kind of environments too, you end up what, you know, regardless of using the phrase, getting signed used to mean a very specific thing, now it means a very specific other thing. Right, <laugh>. Yeah. And now when you get signed, it's sort of like there's this whole package of producers and, featured artists and collaborators and stuff like that, that just come with the package. And I don't think that you even have a choice much anymore, of who or where you're gonna work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Yeah. I mean, the business has changed so much. I mean, and there is more of this notion of kind of rolling your own career where you can, you know, you can be independent, you could, you could sell some products off, off the grid or to your own people or sell direct, and I don't, yeah. I don't know. I don't, so much of that business is such a turnoff and so much, you know, can I curse <laugh>? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>It's just so, just so much bullshit and so much, you know, hot air. Right. That I think the thing is like, what I've really found, like, especially with a lot of the young, young people that I work with, is I try to try to tell them, like, look, I mean, part of it is that is the idea of, it's not a notion of like all or nothing. It's a notion of kind of the way my, my trajectory has gone of, of just being like a worker in the, in, in the, in the field and, and sort of forming some type of a means by more of the, of the trade. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Right. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>And, and not so much about the, because I mean, I've had my brushes with, with fame. I mean, we had a reggae band for years, and there was a point at which we had a major Jamaican producer that was looking to sign my brother and I, and you know, it's like you go through these things where, where there's like this, suddenly there's this great thing that is, you're just on the cusp of, you know what I mean? Mm-hmm. <affirmative> mm-hmm. <affirmative> and, and, and I, and what I've been saying, a lot of these young guys, I work with a lot of young, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1443.16" data-end_ts="1443.28" title="1443.16" id=c_"1443.16">__a__</span> lot of young rappers, and I've kind of tried to say like, you have to sort of think of it as more of a, of a way that you can make a way as a, as a worker, as a technician. It's not like either you are like playing in bars or you are a billionaire. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>You know, there's, there's like, there's gotta <span style="color:red" data-ts="1459.84" data-end_ts="1459.96" title="1459.84" id=c_"1459.84">__be__</span>, there's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>In between stuff <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Yeah. There's gotta be some middle ground. I mean, it's like, you know, I, I heard this interview with Little Steven from, from Bruce Springsteen's band, and he, they were like, you know, did you ever think that you guys were gonna be, you know, that you're gonna make it like this? He was like, hell no. I mean, there were so many middle band groups that were just doing the same thing, you know? Right, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1477.8" data-end_ts="1478.12" title="1477.8" id=c_"1477.8">__right__</span>. So for one of them to become like a stadium rocker and the rest of them to fade into obscurity, I mean, that's, everybody can't be Michael Jackson. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. So you have been, you, you said that you've been work working on building your studio for 25 years. I've got, that makes me, want to ask like 50 questions right there. But the first one is, to what extent is running, doing something, like running a studio, just sort of a marathon, just by its very nature that, that you have to be prepared for the long haul if you're gonna be successful. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>No, I agree. I mean, my town, it's really just having enough repetition of, of, of your name being out there for people to know that that's a place to go. It's, it's been in my home all this time. Right. The last, since 98, it's been in my home. You know, you have to sort of, I guess, convince people to an extent, this is a real studio, and it is a real studio in terms of the marathon of just like, over the years, you mean. Right? Yeah. I mean, I don't even feel that it's a hardship, because in a way it's pretty awesome to be paid to <laugh>. It's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Paid, yeah. It's paid to play with tape recorders. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Yeah. I mean, I mean, occasionally, you know, I don't always, I, the thing is I've cultivated a really cool group of, of clients, you know, not every client is working on projects that I feel are inspiring and awesome, but I feel that what's, what's starting to happen more is I'm, I'm starting to connect with more and more young people that are weirder. There's been a turn in the hip hop world to get back to weird a little bit, you know, where it's kind of gone away from it, you know, it used to be that there was more, more space for like odd, you know, sort of twisted kind of approaches. Right. And then for a long time recently, it's just gotten super straight. And even though people look at it like <span style="color:red" data-ts="1586.68" data-end_ts="1586.8" title="1586.68" id=c_"1586.68">__a__</span> kind of all, like the sort of thuggish rough sort of rough around the edges type of nature of things, I, I feel that even in that it's becoming regimented. Right. You know, and the music is becoming, and the lyrics are becoming more and more basic and less interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, what I've certainly noticed is that in a lot of what's, at least, you know, the popular rap world, it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1609.72" data-end_ts="1609.84" title="1609.72" id=c_"1609.72">__a__</span>, it's becoming as formulaic as r and b I would 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Say. Exactly. No, exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And which, you know, if I think back to, if I think back to some of the, you know, the formation of it, it's hard to even imagine it would've gone that way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Yeah. No, I, I agree. And I, and I never thought working in hip hop in the early days, that when I was listening to the, like the first LL Cool J Record or Beastie Boys, I didn't think of it as pop music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>No, no. Not even close. Well, it's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Definitely become, it's become this crazy dominant musical force, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So when, when you say that you're starting to see it kind of, take a move towards the weird, or, you know, maybe a different way to say it would be experimental, what, what does that look like? Does it look like people, you know, extending like the old Wu-Tang kind of, experimentalism? Or is it people embracing other kinds of music and pulling that in? What does it look like to you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Well, I think part of it is, is breaking out of some of the, the types of production styles and getting into things that are, you know, sort of reintroducing dissonance. Right. And, and also breaking, breaking, you know, 16 bar verse eight bar hook form. And also, I think the most important thing is breaking subject matter apart and not just making songs about sex and sex 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And money. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Sex and money. And, and, you know, and like, you know, beef with between crews and all this kind of stuff. Like, it just gets to be so tiresome and it's, it's crazy. 'cause like, I've just engineered so much of the foul <span style="color:red" data-ts="1707.64" data-end_ts="1707.76" title="1707.64" id=c_"1707.64">__of__</span> shit that you've ever heard. Like, you know, really just terrible subject matter. And, and, you know, I, I'll take it, you know, for the skill and the trade and, and do whatever I gotta do to make it, to make it sound the way the artist wants it to sound. You know what I mean? Uhhuh <affirmative>. Right. But I think, like, I have a new, a, a new kid that I've been mentoring, that that's calling himself Montel Fish. And he's just like a weird, beautiful kid. He's, he's 17 years old, he plays his own music, so he creates his own tracks and he's singing more, and he, he raps about things that are more, he's exposing more of himself and, and being more, what's the word? He's just kind of putting out like different sides of himself, talking about where he might feel, you know, unguarded about certain things. You know what I mean? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, that's, again, that's kind of a gutsy move. It's it, I love 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>It. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I love it. I think, I think in a way, you know, screaming about, you know, screaming about grabbing a stack of cash or, or something is gotta be easy. It's got, you have, from your pos seat especially, it's gotta seem like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1770.66" data-end_ts="1770.88" title="1770.66" id=c_"1770.66">__ah__</span>, that's the easy way out. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Well, it's just, it's also just one of those things where you hear it a thousand times and you're like, Jesus, man. Like, come on. Like, just try to talk about, you know, and, and, and I think the thing is, I I was, I've been really thinking about like, a lot of these groups, like, like this guy Childish Gambino, who's the actor Donald Glover. Okay. Or there's a, there's a guy named Earl Sweatshirt, and this, this crew kind of odd future, like a lot of these guys are, are, are just breaking out of the bonds of, you know, convention in a way that's really interesting and inspiring. Or, I don't <span style="color:red" data-ts="1806.4" data-end_ts="1806.44" title="1806.4" id=c_"1806.4">__know__</span> if you've ever heard of Death Grips. They're not, they just, they just disbanded, but their stuff's noisy and it's loud. It's very punk sounding, you know? <span style="color:red" data-ts="1813.73" data-end_ts="1814.08" title="1813.73" id=c_"1813.73">__Right__</span>. Well, that and think 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1814.96" data-end_ts="1815.08" title="1814.96" id=c_"1814.96">__I__</span> have to look that up 'cause I, I haven't heard of them, but it sounds interesting. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Oh, death grips is, is, it's like <span style="color:red" data-ts="1820.5" data-end_ts="1820.72" title="1820.5" id=c_"1820.5">__the__</span> Death Grip sounds like, like, ERU <span style="color:red" data-ts="1823.02" data-end_ts="1823.44" title="1823.02" id=c_"1823.02">__button__</span> or something <laugh> with, with like screamy wraps on top. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. Well, it's, it's interesting that you, you characterize it as, as punky, because I think sometimes, I mean, at least to me, there, there are a lot of parallels between what to me was a movement that I got off on, which is the punk movement. Right. And, and the rawness of, of rap, especially to me, you know, again, I'm kind of, I don't want to, I don't want to embrace Old Guy Radio here, but maybe, you know, the way I saw rap happening when it was first coming down, it had, it had all that same like anger and rage and almost anti-establishment to the core. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Yeah. And also I think me, the means of production was easier because you think about the earliest tracks that are like drum machine and vocals, you know what I mean? And, and you don't need a big studio to record drum kit and, you know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And in a lot of cases distributed on cassette to the neighbors. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Yeah. So I'm, I'm like, you know, I'm a big fan of any kind of music that is produced, like, you know, old school Jamaican Dance Hall. Right. Or, you know, early hip hop or old school house music. You know, like, I don't feel that that we should be always, you know, extolling the virtues of these temples of sound that are, I love fancy studios, you know what I mean? I love, I love high end gear, but I don't want a kid to ever feel like they can't make their shit because they can't afford, you know, a really nice mic or whatever. Right. They should, they should just use whatever's at hand. And that's, you know, that's why the Four <span style="color:red" data-ts="1918.6" data-end_ts="1918.84" title="1918.6" id=c_"1918.6">__Track__</span> cassette is such a revelation. You know what I mean? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, I have to admit that you, you say that you like, you like Diane Studios. I'm almost irritated by him. I hate to say it that way. But, for me, when I was coming up through the thing, I had trouble embracing the, the crusty studio that I had, or the crusty production technique, I was able to pull off with limited amount of gear because every month, fricking Mix Magazine would show up with the newest $10 million plush studio. Yeah. And I was like, well, I'll never be able to compete with that. Where, where that was just like as wrongheaded as possible. But, but that got to be sort of like, like what the Watchtower is for Jehovah's Witnesses, I guess. <laugh>, you know. Right. Mixed Magazine was for recording people, which was to kind of hook you into doing it this way. Like it's always like we've been told it should always have been done. I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1976.4" data-end_ts="1976.52" title="1976.4" id=c_"1976.4">__kinda__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1976.52" data-end_ts="1976.72" title="1976.52" id=c_"1976.52">__wish__</span>. Right. That's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Why I love tape. I love tape op though, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Popop. Yeah. I was gonna say, I wish that tape op would've existed back then. 'cause then I would've said, oh, you know what, A four track in the chicken coop is an absolutely cool studio. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Yeah, no, I, I, I totally support that. And, and I, you know, some of the greatest stuff ever was produced with just the most humble means. And I think Fidelity is, is is, you know, fidelity is important. I mean, I certainly, I have my share of of snobby audio gear. You know, I use a U 87 mic generally, and I have a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2007.04" data-end_ts="2007.32" title="2007.04" id=c_"2007.04">__Neve__</span> Clone pre, and I have a, I have an a p I pre and I love the way that stuff sounds, you know what I mean? I don't, I I wanted to talk about distortion, you know what I mean? Just the notion of distortion because, you know, Johnath Jonathan Stern, he wrote, audible past, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, this is not ringing a bell to me. No. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>He wrote that book and he wrote a book called The MP three A Meaning of a Format Yes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That I read, I read that when I was getting my master's degree. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>So <span style="color:red" data-ts="2033.72" data-end_ts="2033.84" title="2033.72" id=c_"2033.72">__I__</span>, so I went to a, a thing that he was speaking about, speaking at C M U, actually. And I was, we were, we were talking, in <span style="color:red" data-ts="2041.32" data-end_ts="2041.52" title="2041.32" id=c_"2041.32">__as__</span> sort of a, in a talkback section. And I asked about MP threes. 'cause we had been talking about MP threes, and I was saying about how it was such a scourge and such a curse to my work and how, you know, people are always bringing me these instrumentals. And he's, what he said that I thought was so interesting is he said that every generation has its distortions or has its distortion. And, you know, if you think back to vinyl records or cassettes or guitar amplifiers or whatever, there's always some way that people are roughing up sound. Right. You know what I mean? Right. Whether it, whether it be intentionally or accidentally. But we shouldn't dismiss like the creations just because we find that form of distortion may unpleasant at first. You know what I mean? Yeah, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's funny too, I mean, at one point I had actually sketched out a, I I didn't know what I was gonna do with it if I was gonna try and have it published or whatever, but the, but the title of this article that I wrote was, Walter Seer <span style="color:red" data-ts="2098.68" data-end_ts="2098.8" title="2098.68" id=c_"2098.68">__is__</span> a fucking Idiot. Right. <laugh>, because I would read everything about him. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2103.84" data-end_ts="2104.04" title="2103.84" id=c_"2103.84">__And__</span> it's like, well, without The Tube, we don't even have music. And without a recording industry the way it's always existed, we don't even have music. Yeah. And, and these kids today, you know, whenever you hear that phrase, these kids today, you just want to grit your teeth and just, you know, and he'd be like, they don't even know how to make good sounding music. I was like, you know, if you really think about it, practically every interesting recording technique from the last 30 years has really come out of people who are using crap gear that found an interesting use for it. You know, production and, and recording techniques have come out of, out of poverty and necessity far more often than they've come out of excess. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2150.82" data-end_ts="2151.04" title="2150.82" id=c_"2150.82">__No__</span>, I agree. I agree. I mean, this, this engineer friend of mine, he works with this dude, Earl Sweatshirt, and he was saying this, this kid is a total, like, he's just a very creative, unique guy. He said that the guy put a, apple pitch shifter plugin, the au pitch. Right, right. That he puts it on the master bus and just pitches the whole damn thing down. And he's like, just, you know, just Yeah. Yeah. He's just like, I don't, I don't give a fuck, man. I love the way it sounds and Yeah. And I know that it's wrong. And, and the guy, the guy is just saying that he's working with all these kids. And it's the same way with me. Like, I try to show some best practices and say, look, I mean, we can get more definition out of the base if we side chain this way, or if we cut here and we don't, you know, we don't like stack up our frequencies in the low end. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Right. But sometimes, you know, wrong. Yeah. Like you said, it's, I love, I love hearing new abuses, and I feel like as an older guy in the, in the music industry, I'm, I'm inspired all the time by, by kids coming up with, you know, I don't wanna see what they do when they go into a palace. Right. Like, I want, I wanna see what they do when they're just by themselves and nobody's telling them that it's wrong. I mean, on the other hand, like, I do get recordings from people for me to, to mix, and I am horrified. Yeah. Sometimes. And I do feel that there's nothing wrong with showing what some better practices are. Like certainly telling them like, Hey, let me just show you how to kind of like create a dead, like a, a quiet area in your space where you can put a mic mm-hmm. <affirmative> where, where you can like, isolate it from outside traffic sounds or turn off the air conditioner or turn down your monitors. Like shit like that I think is, is not being overly snobby. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, do you ever find that people who come in with, with really rough tracks like that too, assume that because you're a engineer, that you can just like, turn the magic knob and make everything sound great? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Well, I mean, yeah. And yeah, I've definitely heard that, heard that a bunch of times. Like, well, can't you just fix that? But, but my thing to them is that the thing is like, I just feel like as a sound engineer part, I want to tell people like, sure, I can definitely work on this and I can go through and I can remove all the, you know, noise between your, between your ad lib tracks and all this stuff, but you have to pay me Right. For the time. Right. Right. So, so I might, I might be able to spend two hours cleaning this track up, and I do support on the other hand, like, if they, if what they need to do is to hang out with a bunch of their boys and get wasted and just get in the zone and, and create this like, crazy ass thing, I'd rather they do that in their own space than, than come to me. You know what I mean? Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>But they have to understand like, I have to charge you Yeah. <laugh>, you know, to like get all this crap outta here and it's gonna sound better. You know, I think that a leaky mic with like monitors feeding back into it is not really what you're necessarily going for <laugh>, but maybe something about, you know, the guy like screaming into the mic and just distorting everything is cool, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You know? Well, you know, this is, this is a thing that I actually really learned when I was working with the punks down in Denton, Texas, is how often I needed to just get the hell out of the way. Because it turns out that trying to make the, make a great recording and providing the vibe that it took for someone to really let it loose, it's two completely different things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>No, I agree. I agree. And, and I think especially vocal performances. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Especially, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Yeah. I've, I've definitely had people in the booth like spilling their soul and it's like, I'm not gonna get in the way and just be like, you know, I mean, I, I wanna avoid certain things, you know, like if, if a preamp is clipping or whatever, you know, I'd like to sort of make that not happen. 'cause I do feel like <span style="color:red" data-ts="2373.38" data-end_ts="2373.6" title="2373.38" id=c_"2373.38">__the__</span>, you know, getting back to the thing about distortion is it's like distortion iss awesome. I think it's just sort of knowing where and when to do it. Sure. 'cause I've, like, I've recently been doing some mixes for people and reintroducing digital clipping to certain things on a second, you know, a secondary bus Yeah. With kicks and snares and, and using like, that plug, bit crusher plugin. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>To kind of, but, but just so that it's not on everything, you know what I mean? Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Of course. <laugh>. You know, again, it's, it's interesting to me to see that, you know, side chaining, which for a long time was just sort of like the thing engineers did and nobody talked about all of a sudden now is a real creative practice. And I think that, you know, some of this use of like secondary buses with effects, that's, you're starting to hear about that come on more and more <span style="color:red" data-ts="2426.82" data-end_ts="2427.04" title="2426.82" id=c_"2426.82">__is__</span> people want to be able to control these sort of heavy and across the mix kind of functions. So it's kind of cool to, it's kind of cool to literally see sort of the recording practice, change before your eyes, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Right. Well, I think, I think the thing is like, coming from being a person that, you know, made records on tape machines and, and consoles is, you know, I don't yearn for the good old days. I feel like, you know, as a person that's done all that stuff and, and spliced tape and, and edited, you know, edited, half inch masters and all that stuff, like, I, I'm glad I had a chance to do all that stuff, but I, I feel that you can always find a way to rough it up. Right. In an in, in an interesting way and having the flexibility to do it however you want. I, I'm not a, I'm not a fan of like, complaining about the fact that I have too many options. Right. I think that you can, I think you can impose options and, and keep your track count down and, and all of that within a daw. And I think the fact is, we're lucky and, you know, as an, as an older person that that has had the chance to do it with hardware. I love Ableton Live. I think it is like the coolest thing in the world. And I, and I, I've told people, I feel it's like the culmination of like everything I've ever done, every piece of gear I've ever worked with, every sampler I've ever used, you know, with, with the flexibility of being able to do just about anything 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. And do it in real time. I yeah, I agree with you. I mean, I <laugh>, this is a funny story, but at one point, I went, into town we had to, we wanted to buy of all things. It didn't last long around house, but this thing called the love sack, right. Which is basically a six foot around beanbag chair <laugh>. Okay. And they sell these at love sack stores inexplicably. So we go into the Love Sack store and, the sales dude who was, you know, I about the age of my shoes was talking to me about how, you know, asking me like what I did. And I was like, well, you know, I'm in the audio industry. And, and he's like, oh, do you know of tape <span style="color:red" data-ts="2559.96" data-end_ts="2560.16" title="2559.96" id=c_"2559.96">__hop__</span>? I'm like, yeah, I know. Tape <span style="color:red" data-ts="2561.2" data-end_ts="2561.4" title="2561.2" id=c_"2561.2">__hop__</span>. It's really cool magazine. He's like, yeah, that describes my perfect life. I'm like, really? So like, what are the things that you're really into? He's like, tape decks, I just want to do tape decks. And he's like, have you ever worked with tape decks? And I was like, dude, if I could have all the rewind time that I've ever experienced in my life, if <span style="color:red" data-ts="2581.8" data-end_ts="2581.84" title="2581.8" id=c_"2581.8">__I__</span> could have all of that back, I would be about your age.

<p>
<b>Herman: </b><laugh>. Yeah. Yeah.

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And so there are parts of that stuff that nobody really recognizes as being a pain, right? Yeah. Like crosstalk, who even thinks about crosstalk at this point, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Yeah. And it's like trying to reclaim some of that by using these new, you know, bus summing Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And little leakage plugins. Go figure that. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Yeah. I mean, and I, and I think, I think that's the thing is like, we've come, I mean, I know a lot of people say this, but it's like we've come full circle because if you think about, like, I remember I was telling, telling somebody about the, what I was living out in Oregon and the, there was a Nile Rogers record that came out called Something Plan B or something like that, and, plan B matinee or something like that. And it was one of those early records that was done either on a Fairlight or a Sinlair, right. And, and everybody was flipping out like, this is the future. This is incredible. Listen, there's no, there's no background noise, there's no tapist, there's no nothing. And there's, you know, there's also no character <laugh> in that record. I mean, it's just, it's just squeaky clean. It's like all samples, all internal, very kind of harsh, you know, Nile Rogers is incredible. Yeah. But you know, it's like those early records are, are pretty damn dry. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Yeah. I remember my first, my, the first album I got that I was like really screaming about it, you know, being digitally recorded was, Ry Cooter Oh, Ryer. It was a Ry Cooter album. And, I always loved his music, but it was really weird to hear this like real old school music with this real plastic edge to it. 'cause you know, they, I mean, they were just getting their shit together with, digital, analog to digital converters and all mm-hmm. <affirmative> and editing functions and all that stuff. So it was kind of a, kind of a tadd horrific, I think trying to do it and then to have that music be at the forefront was really weird. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Yeah. I mean, and, and even just think about the, the, the thing that changed everything for people like me was, you know, I went from a half, I went from a half inch eight track machine syncing to syncing to digital performer or, or syncing digital performer with sti Right. To a, to a to <span style="color:red" data-ts="2724.52" data-end_ts="2724.68" title="2724.52" id=c_"2724.52">__eight__</span>, to Aada. Yeah. And it was like, at that time it was like choosing between Aada and D 88. Right. You know, like that, that stuff sounds pretty terrible, but it's also, once again, like the thing that, you know, it put into our hands like the capability of doing all this stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, yeah. Well, because I mean, people I think now have trouble even imagining an eight track limit, or the fact is back then for, for many of us, it was a six track limit because you always had to keep two tracks for the inevitable bounce down to stereo. Right. So that you could do more sweetening over the top or whatever. And so when all of a sudden the ADAT showed up and it was like, oh my God, you mean I I have virtually no sound loss when I dump it to two channels. It was pretty, pretty incredible. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Yeah. No, it's cool. You know, but it's just, I think things are better now, <laugh>. Oh 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I do too. Well, and again, I think what's what'll be interesting to me is to sort of like cast 15 years from now and say, what are we gonna look back to today and say, oh, those poor SAPs with that cheesy shit. Right. You know? Yeah. Is it gonna be, you know, the pitch shifting that we do, or is it gonna, you know, what's it gonna be? I'm, I'm, I'm wonder 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>It'll probably be auto autocorrect tuning <laugh>. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>And the thing is like, I'm not even mad about that. Like, I, I think a lot of those abuses are hilarious and interesting and, you know, there's some, there's some hip hop artists that are doing some really crazy stuff with that type of technology. Right. And, you know, I, I think there's nothing wrong with, with playing around with it, you could always look back on, I mean, I don't know, like a lot of the records I've done listening back to certain things, a lot of things I, I listened back to and I feel like it still holds up. And then I think the things that were really too much on the nose with like some new trend, that's, that's usually the thing that, that <span style="color:red" data-ts="2837.91" data-end_ts="2838.03" title="2837.91" id=c_"2837.91">__I__</span>, that makes me, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's what suffers. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Yeah. That makes me wince when I'm just like, ah. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And at the time you thought that that was the one that nailed it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Yeah. Yeah. I just listened to an old record that I was so inspired by, by Massive Attack and Uhhuh and Port <span style="color:red" data-ts="2853.36" data-end_ts="2853.52" title="2853.36" id=c_"2853.36">__his__</span> head. It was like, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, me too. Massive attack was to me, I heard that. I was like, oh, slowing that shit down is so right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Yeah, it's incredible. Yeah, for sure. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. So you are obviously doing a lot of music yourself as you know, in addition to the sound design and stuff. First of all, do you, when you're working with artists, whether it's, whether it's rap artists or whatever, do you kind of put yourself out there as also being able to do some of the performance or some of the instrumental work? Or do you, or do you try and completely separate your recording and engineering life from your creative performance life? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Well, I mean, lately I've been putting more into like the people, that I'm sort of more connected with in, in a, mentorship type of a position. Right. But I don't tend, tend in, in the hip hop world to really make tracks. And I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2908" data-end_ts="2908.12" title="2908" id=c_"2908">__w__</span> and I usually tell people, look, the stuff that I wanna do is probably too weird for you. Right. And, and I don't want to take something that I really love and, and have somebody do something that I'm just not that crazy about. Yeah. Artistically. But in general, for a lot of like just the session kind of work, people tend to bring in, bring in the music that they want to use, because most of the times people tend to be inspired by the music already that they want to use. Right. So like, you know, worst case scenario is people just bringing in a two <span style="color:red" data-ts="2934.96" data-end_ts="2935.2" title="2934.96" id=c_"2934.96">__track__</span> beat and I'll just suck it up and live with it. You know what I mean? Right. Sure. Even if I don't, and I'll complain, I'll usually complain and just say, look, this beat sounds really bad. And most of the times people will just look at me like, I'm crazy <laugh>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2947.26" data-end_ts="2947.48" title="2947.26" id=c_"2947.26">__but__</span> <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>But, you know, I, this <span style="color:red" data-ts="2950" data-end_ts="2950.16" title="2950" id=c_"2950">__guy__</span>, this one client is calling me. He calls me Bat Ears now. He's like, dude, I don't hear what you're hearing. And, and it's, and it's a, it's a really great guy that I'm working with. This dude, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2958.66" data-end_ts="2958.88" title="2958.66" id=c_"2958.66">__Azi__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2959.08" data-end_ts="2959.2" title="2959.08" id=c_"2959.08">__X__</span>, he's a really awesome, pretty militant in places, mc, who's originally from Chicago, but he lives here. Okay. And he, he's part of a, he runs a program with his wife called One Hood, which is awesome youth programming that that teaches kids about, you know, lyric writing, but also about, social justice issues. And, so that's been incredible. But, so there's that. And then the next, the next best, the best thing is that they bring in instrumentals that they're connected with, with the producer, so that the producer or producers are gonna provide stems or Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>They're gonna provide individual tracks. So I just mixed the guys record that I really am, am digging. I just, just finished the mastering for that last night and ran him all the files. And so that, that gives me the chance to, you know, to like stretch out and even just correct for things and tighten up the low end and, you know, really optimize it. And, you know, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="3012.36" data-end_ts="3012.64" title="3012.36" id=c_"3012.36">__wanted__</span> to, I want the stuff to bang, you know, I want to, I want to be able to compete and to be able to like live in the arena of, its counterparts, you know what I mean? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>So, and, and then in, and in some cases, if somebody brings in a beat, I may enhance it for them. When I'm doing sessions more in live, like normally I work in performer mm-hmm. <affirmative>, but, but if I'm, but if I see that maybe a beat needs some help, I might sort of treat the mid-range and high end of it as a sample and then build around it with, you know, with drum rack and stuff like that. So I've been doing more of that lately, and that lets me get a little bit of my creative juices going for those types of tracks 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Kinda wedged into that work. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Yeah. Just because, you know, sometimes I just feel like people, there's been this, this sort of plague of beats from places like Sound Click and, which is like a, a sort of a, a horrible kind of middle of the road place where people go and get beats that are more like soundalike kind of tracks. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. So people will be like, I want a beat that sounds like Rick Ross, or I want a beat that sounds like this or that. And Wiz Khalifa, who's also from Pittsburgh. So you'll have all these clone beats that people will pick, but the producers don't make them with <span style="color:red" data-ts="3080.76" data-end_ts="3080.88" title="3080.76" id=c_"3080.76">__a__</span>, with an ear for like, what's gonna happen next. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that's really curious to me. So you're saying that it's almost like sound library work, but as backing tracks for rappers rather than backing tracks for a TV show? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Yeah, it's crazy. It's, and, and you'll, and you'll hear just like things that are just, just literal knockoffs. It's really discouraging, you know? And I always just try to say to people like, please try to find some kindred spirits that will like, follow through on this project with you and let's, like, let's try to upgrade, you know, and it's also a budget thing, you know what I mean? <span style="color:red" data-ts="3114.2" data-end_ts="3114.32" title="3114.2" id=c_"3114.2">__Yeah__</span>. 'cause not everybody can, sometimes people want to just bang outta track and have it done in an hour. That's fine. You know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I guess. But, you know, on the flip side of it is, I, I was actually, it was a while back, but I was really encouraged by this one magazine called Scratch Magazine. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, I don't know if you remembered it. I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Don't know that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. It was, it was literally a magazine that was oriented towards Beat Makers rather than the rap star. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And it was really cool because they talk, they talk to people, not about, you know, you know, what was it like when you were in the v i p room with so <span style="color:red" data-ts="3151.64" data-end_ts="3151.76" title="3151.64" id=c_"3151.64">__and__</span> so, but more like, what was it like when you were in your bedroom with your M P C 1000? Right. Cracking off this beat. And it was really interesting because they sort of like took what to me was some really, really creative work and highlighted it. And unfortunately after about 50, 50 episodes of the magazine they were done. Right. Sure. But it was really super inspiring up to that point. And for me, I always looked at that as being like one of those super creative and super kind of growth areas for people that were into doing production and music creation, but not necessarily into the star lifestyle. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Right. And that, that's the thing. And, and what I was gonna come back to, and I wanted to talk briefly about, this apprenticeship program that I'm developing mm-hmm. <affirmative>, is that I always found that e even within like most groups, if you had a, if you had a couple, couple people that were involved in some kind of, like, especially a rap thing, there was always that person, there was always one person, one kid that was much more oriented towards the production end of things. Right. Maybe they were the beat maker. And those were the people that I always feel a lot of kinship to because I want to, I want to, I always feel like they are the ones that are the crafts person and the artist and the, I'm not gonna say that other people aren't artists, but they're the people that are getting into the nuts and bolts and the work and are more interested in the technique and are more like watching me to see what it is that I'm doing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Right. You know what I mean? And I feel like there is so much craft and so much tradition, you know, even though it sounds funny, you know, like if you're thinking about the earliest sampling drum machines, you know, emu sb 12 hundreds and, you know, early and Sonics and stuff like that. Like we had, we had, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3256.87" data-end_ts="3256.99" title="3256.87" id=c_"3256.87">__I__</span> I worked with a lot of people that used a Sr tens. Yeah. You know what I mean? And it's kind of like the beat makers, you know, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="3263.03" data-end_ts="3263.19" title="3263.03" id=c_"3263.03">__almost__</span>, I almost just kind of feel like it's, it's sort of, I'm not gonna say it's disparaging, but it's sort of like, kind of under understating what it is that people are actually doing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You mean by calling it beat making? Yeah. I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Mean, I, I like beat making, but I also feel like they're, they're, those are the people that are, that are the producers. You know, they're, they're doing more than just making a track. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. To me, what they were doing was sort of like creating the game board that the game got played in. And sure, you might play play chess or checkers on top of it, but without the game board, you've got nothing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>I, I think that there's, you know, there is a lack of, of some of the tradition and connection now because of the way that people are getting instrumentals for songs. You know, like you listen to interviews with like, you know, bomb squad people that were working with Public Enemy, like Hank Shockley, and like, they really, they really saw their role as being much more a part of the group and being involved in the productions from beginning to end. Yeah. You know, so they would do everything from creating the tracks, starting to build them to being involved in the composition and the mixing of things. And I feel like there is a weird disconnect now with kids that are making tracks, and then they're just like, okay, this is done. And a lot of times I'll, I'll, you know, I'll bitch about it and I'll just be like, look, this, this dude has this sample, like the, the mid-range instrumental sample, the keyboard sound or whatever, way too loud for this song because, because it's like, I don't know whether this guy's gonna be whispering on the track, whether he is gonna be yelling, whether he is gonna be singing, whether it's gonna be a poem, you know, like all those decisions, the instrument, the in instrumental part of the song has to be in service of this new thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>So, so why the hell are we just like rapping on top of this thing now? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, that's a great point. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>And, and that's, and that's why I get so excited when I can, like, people think I'm being like such a nerd, but I'm just like, dude, please give me the parts to this song. Like, I won't take that long. Like if I could just have the chance to turn it 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Down <span style="color:red" data-ts="3374.99" data-end_ts="3375.15" title="3374.99" id=c_"3374.99">__just__</span> to tweak it a little bit. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Right. Yeah. You know, and, and then when I do, people are just like, holy shit, that sounds so much better. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>You know, but it's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Bat ears <laugh>. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So now you have, now you have to like, add onto it. So you're like, your Facebook thing has to be Bat perman, soy sauce, bat ears pearl. You have to start like <span style="color:red" data-ts="3396.08" data-end_ts="3396.2" title="3396.08" id=c_"3396.08">__a__</span> tacking all these things on. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>People will think I have these crazy big ears or something, 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b><laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>They'll see you. It's like, my goodness, your ears are regular sized. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>I don't <span style="color:red" data-ts="3406.16" data-end_ts="3406.24" title="3406.16" id=c_"3406.16">__know__</span> why they call you bad ears, 
</p>

<p>
<b>UNKNOWN_SPEAKER_01: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So I'm curious about the apprenticeship program that you talked about and, I teach at a local university, so I get some of my teaching yaya's out that way, but I've never done a one-on-one apprenticeship because I'm kind of scared of like being the, you know, the old guy waving. I don't want to be Walter Sr. You know? Right. I want to be something else. And, how do you handle that? How do you, how are you able to apprentice people without getting in their way and without having them say, oh yeah, the old coot just showed me how to properly wind a mic cable or something. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Right. <laugh>, well, this is a, this is a thing that we're just getting going. And I have this great assistant that works with me, this kid Amos, who is a, he's studying mu music education. He's going for his master's, so he, he understands about dealing with the metrics of this thing. Right. But I think the thing it's, it's like, that just seems really great right now is that it's been <span style="color:red" data-ts="3467.52" data-end_ts="3467.64" title="3467.52" id=c_"3467.52">__to__</span> this very organic process of working with young people over the course of the years and just developing this rapport. So I think on one hand, like these guys, this, this program is just getting <span style="color:red" data-ts="3479.84" data-end_ts="3480.12" title="3479.84" id=c_"3479.84">__ready__</span>, ready to roll out pretty soon. And we kind of have a whole, it's not a formalized thing yet, but, we've been in discussion with, with some of the local foundations. And, I'm really excited. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>I feel like this is, this is the, the path for the next number of years. Like, it, it makes sense. I think part of it is, is that first of all, you're working with people that want to be there. Right. And, and they, and I think that, that I've been able to demonstrate through working with them that I am, I am that old guy, you know, and they're all young enough to be my kids, but, they, they respect the fact that I, that I love the music and I, and that I'm showing them respect, and I also am interested in their ideas. So it's not like I'm saying to them like, distortion is bad or don't put too much reverb on your voice, or something like that. But I wanna, I wanna show them, you know, the idea is to develop a set of fundamentals. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>So to teach, to teach about gain staging, to, to teach about saturation and eq, you know, modulation, spatial effects, reverbs delays, you know, teaching about EQs and the different kinds of EQs. And I think the thing is that the people that want to be there are psyched about that. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, you know <span style="color:red" data-ts="3549.64" data-end_ts="3549.68" title="3549.64" id=c_"3549.64">__what__</span> I mean? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Right. So it's really, it's really even just for the first time, like showing somebody how a high pass filter on a vocal or on a kick drum, you know, why you'd wanna do that. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And, you know, when I'm talking to somebody about watching and managing the low end of a song, it's not because I'm a stuck up dick, it's because I want the shit to be hot. I want it to bang, I want it to, I want it to compete and be able to play alongside other, other songs in its zone. You know what I mean? Right. So it's kind of like, it's like, look, dude, this, this, this track is not gonna do what it is that you think you want it to do if we don't address some of these kinds of things. So, you know, teaching about compression, it's huge. You know what I mean? And I think when people get their hands on the tools and they start to start to really see there's like excitement there, you know what I mean? There's like Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>There's a thrill. Like, just to be like, well, you know, why are we putting compressors on these things? You know, because it makes the vocal be able to be loud and clear and manage the dynamics of it and be able to sit in a track that is aggressive. Yep. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>We have blown through a ton of time here and we haven't even talked very much about synthesizers and modulars and all that kind of stuff. Maybe we'll save that for a future discussion, but just really quick. Sure, sure. Because all the muff Wiggler people are gonna be like, what the hell's going on? <laugh>? Right. <laugh>. So we have to honor those people. Sure, sure. You are, you are generally, the way I the way I would characterize it is that, that you're kind of a mouthpiece for, <laugh> for Pittsburgh modulars on the, on the <span style="color:red" data-ts="3649.24" data-end_ts="3649.36" title="3649.24" id=c_"3649.24">__mouth__</span> Wiggles site. What is your relationship with them and how into the modular game are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Sure. Well, so I, I've basically known Richard Nichols since before he started the company. He used to be a.com guy, so he had this big <laugh> right.com system, and I was, I was already using a Eurorack system, which I started building around 2006 mm-hmm. <affirmative>. So before that I actually had an, I still do have an R 2,600, so I wanted to kind of add to that. Right. So he started building his first modules literally in his basement, and then, subsequently moved his, manufacturing assembly space to the building where we have our dance studio. Got it. So, I've sort of just kind of organically morphed into a, you said mouthpiece, brand ambassador, <laugh>, artist relations. Like I've been dealing with, local people that have contacted us about learning about the systems or, you know, getting support and information about things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>So I'll, I'll try to fill in there. I'm, I'm at the shop all the time 'cause it's so close and it's also where we have our space. Oh, sure. Okay. So I'll, I'll, I'll hang out and we'll talk about interface design and panel ergonomics and, you know, I'll beta test everything that, that we make and give it a <span style="color:red" data-ts="3733.08" data-end_ts="3733.28" title="3733.08" id=c_"3733.08">__role__</span>, give it, you know, give it a spin in the field. I went to namm, with them for the last, you know, the recent nam Right. In Anaheim and, spent, you know, a week, you know, just talking about the products and, and giving demos to people and stuff like that. So, you know, and I, and like I said, I keep an eye on the Muff forum for when people are having problems and try to try to like redirect when necessary to get people to, you know, to write the company if they're having a problem with something like that. Sure. But yeah, I used Was 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That, was that your first mam by the way? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>It was, yeah. It was crazy. Yeah. And I saw Mike Matley there a few times. We had a, he had a chance to hang out, so that was, that was awesome. Yeah. But, that was his 19th 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Yeah. It's, it's, it's funny. Well, so what was, what was your takeaway from namm? What did you, did you like being there or was it too overwhelming? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>No, I did, I liked it. I love, I love big grounds <laugh>. I mean, it was, it was definitely like, you have to learn to, to pace yourself and, drink lots of water. And we all caught some sort of snotty, you know, you know, respiratory thing on the way in, so it was keeping that managed. Right. But it was like learning about like what end users were using and what, what people's experiences was. I spent a lot of time talking with people about what DASS they use and how to interface the systems into their new, into their workflow mm-hmm. <affirmative> and, so that was like a lot of really good information and just seeing what other people had. I, I really came away pretty psyched about just the, the, response that people had to the systems because, you know, even with the smallest system, the system 10, the 10.1, it sounds great. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Like it really sounds great. It's a legit, real synthesizer. Yeah. It's, it sounds fantastic and I think that people really are, are connecting with, with Pittsburgh stuff, and it's, it's very, it's accessible. You know what I mean? It has enough weirdness to it, and it also has enough of a familiar, side that, that I think a lot of people will see it as a good option. And, and the, the price is, you know, the price is good. It's, it's placed in a, in a, in a, you know, accessible world. You know what I mean? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, indeed. I absolutely, well, yeah, one of the things I have to admit is that I really think it's cool that you're, when you're talking about them, you talk about it as a we. Yeah. Which is really cool because it's like you're informally attached to, to what they're doing. But also there is a sense, I mean, in a lot of cases when I talk about modular manufacturers and stuff, I even refer to them as being part of a we thing because there is a sense of community around this whole modular thing that I think is really cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Yeah. No, I think it's great. I mean, I, I actually did have to get myself to say we, because I'm not like a formal employee, but I'm a friend of the companies and I'm there all the time. Right. And I do, and, and all, especially I think the last, that last NAMM run definitely made me feel like part of the team, you know what I mean? Right, right. And and I feel like my role is, is valuable and, and I've helped to, you know, I've helped to sort of find things where there were snags in, in a, in a panel or something like that. Or just even just figuring out like where to put knobs, where to put switches, you know, how to sort of redirect something or add a feature or take away feature, you know, so it's, it's nice because, you know, they sort of see me as someone that uses this stuff all the time and, and knows how to use it and knows sort of, it has an idea of like what people would want or what they wouldn't want. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3960.33" data-end_ts="3960.68" title="3960.33" id=c_"3960.33">__Heron__</span>, I want to thank you for your time. But before we go on your Facebook posting, you mentioned something about soon you're gonna be heading off to Turkey. What's up with that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>So I have a big birthday coming up and my wife and I are gonna go for two weeks, mainly to Istanbul. And I have this beautiful fantasy of interfacing with all these artists in, in Turkey and sort of having a, the kind of beautiful time that I would give somebody that was visiting from Turkey, you know what I mean? Right, sure. So, so we've been getting all these great referrals and, people that have worked in Turkey, people that are teaching in Turkey, and I'm just, you know, I'm just thrilled, man. I I, I could really use this. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that sounds really exciting. Boy, I would love to, to do something like that myself. I have, have to get my kids outta elementary school, I think before I'm gonna be able to pull that one off. Yeah, definitely. But still, that sounds pretty awesome. So anyone out there who, has contacts in, Istanbul, send <span style="color:red" data-ts="4023.36" data-end_ts="4023.48" title="4023.36" id=c_"4023.36">__them__</span> on in or, or if you can get to, Herman directly, shoot him the info because I think, people would find it really interesting. So Herman, I wanna thank you so much for your time. It was really inspiring to me to kind of see a person who's weaving this really cool life together. Thank you so much for sharing and have a great day, man. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Herman: </b>Thanks Darwin Alright. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Many thanks to Herman for that great interview. It was really cool to kind of hear about the recording studio and current recording practice, from a guy whose feet are on the ground. It's also really cool to sort of get to know the man behind the soy sauce name a little bit. It was really pretty awesome to talk to him. I hope that you enjoyed it as much as I do. Thanks everyone for listening. Please, if you get a chance, jump over to iTunes and give me a positive review if you can. Otherwise, just keep on listening. We're getting great listenership numbers, which makes me feel like the word's getting spread. That's really awesome. I want to thank everyone for their help and I'll talk to you next week. Bye.
