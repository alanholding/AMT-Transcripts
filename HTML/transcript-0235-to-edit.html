<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, today I get a chance to talk to somebody who I've been exchanging mail with email with for a while. But, this is our first chance to talk. His name's Ed Ball and he has got a really unique practice. He's part painter, part musician, electronic musician. He's a composer, a performer. He is, expecting to become an author. He's got all kinds of irons in the fire, so I'm really anxious to talk to him. So, with that, let's say hi to Ed. Hey, ed. How's it going? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed Ball: </b>Hi, Darwin. Yeah, it's going really well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So why don't we kick this off by having you talk a little bit about what your artistic practice is. I find it fascinating, so please, let's, let's share with the listeners. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>Well, I suppose I <span style="color:red" data-ts="53.355" data-end_ts="53.645" title="53.355" id=c_"53.355">__will__</span> start by telling people I paint music and sound and sort of, that's it. I like to keep it really simple at first. I mean, there's a lot that goes behind that, but, I feel that sometimes as an artist, you can scare people off by going too deep too fast. So I like to say that I, paint music. I go with the flow and rhythm of music and try and express that in, you know, a fine art painterly form. So I suppose that's the, the hub of my practice. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, just so people who are listening, we're gonna provide you with some links to go explore online a little bit. But basically what you're talking about then is that you use music as an inspiration for, for doing paintings, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>Yeah. I use, music as a, a catalyst to paint <span style="color:red" data-ts="107.465" data-end_ts="107.685" title="107.465" id=c_"107.465">__to__</span>, in a very visceral form. So I'm taking, I mean, and not, not necessarily just music, it, it can be sound, you know, in the case of, obviously we'll talk about going forward, getting into modular stuff and that it could be drones, it could be anything like that. It's, it's taken the, the visceral form of that. And, <span style="color:red" data-ts="127.585" data-end_ts="127.805" title="127.585" id=c_"127.585">__you__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="127.805" data-end_ts="127.885" title="127.805" id=c_"127.805">__know__</span>, putting that into, a painting form 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right now. One of 'em that just like really jumped off of the, the page for me when I first was looking at your work, was the piece that you did based off of, off of a Goldie album. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>Yeah, yeah. So, yeah, I mean, I really got into drum and bass in a, in a big way, sort of late nineties, early two thousands. And I suppose it's one of my favorite genres. There's lots of favorite genres <span style="color:red" data-ts="159.165" data-end_ts="159.325" title="159.165" id=c_"159.165">__of__</span> electronic music, but at that time, it, you know, I, I remember walking to Way Ahead Records at the time. I was living in a place called Darbyshire, and they were playing, they'd just got this album Timeless and, which to me is one of the most classic drum and bass albums out there. And I, I, I was just like mesmerized. I, I remember running up to them and going, what, what he's playing? What are you playing? And they said, oh, this album. And I just, you know, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="191.845" data-end_ts="192.045" title="191.845" id=c_"191.845">__got__</span> have one now grabbed it, took it <span style="color:red" data-ts="193.805" data-end_ts="193.965" title="193.805" id=c_"193.805">__home__</span> because I think at that time, you know, drum <span style="color:red" data-ts="196.885" data-end_ts="197.045" title="196.885" id=c_"196.885">__and__</span> bass was doing something quite special. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>I sort of then started, you know, getting into goldish music quite a lot. And there was a, a, an album called Incredible Sound of Drummond Bass, which actually wasn't just goldish compositions, right? It was all of these, metalhead skies that, and he did like a sort of seamless sort of mix, right, between lots of, you know, sort of classics, that were around at the time. I painted that on a three <span style="color:red" data-ts="224.895" data-end_ts="225.245" title="224.895" id=c_"224.895">__meter__</span> canvas. And in fact, it was, I say it was sort of like the dawn of when I started painting music because, I, I'd painted one music, one piece to music before that. And then I went straight into this three meter canvas, and it was just like a magical moment for me. It's, it's that, that piece, I still ha own that piece because I, I love it so much. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>Very pivotal in a lot of ways. One, because, you know, it was when I discovered painting to music is just, you know, a fantastic thing to do. Two was weirdly on my birthday <laugh>. And, and you know, when all those stars align. Yeah. Right. And three, when the actual piece becomes a strong piece, you know, when you look at it in time. And, I always say time is <span style="color:red" data-ts="270.505" data-end_ts="270.725" title="270.505" id=c_"270.505">__the__</span>, the great knowledge of art because, you know, you might think a piece is great at thirst, and then two months down the line you're sort of like, all <span style="color:red" data-ts="276.485" data-end_ts="276.525" title="276.485" id=c_"276.485">__right__</span>, that's gotta go in the bin. And then, you know, you might not quite like a piece, but in three years time you think, wow, this piece is is incredible piece. And, you know, it's always been, been a strong piece for me. And, you know, a lot of sort of emotion invested in that piece, if you like. So, so yeah, that was probably one of my first large scale, paintings. And, it's quite a chaotic album, so it's quite a chaotic painting, and I hope that's what I bring out in my, in my work, is that it's a reflection of the music and, and the, energy behind the music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right now. When I kind of jumped on your site and was looking around, one of the things that I found really interesting is that in addition to doing these as sort of like setin, pre-made pieces, you also have a practice where you kind of, in a very performer Lee way actually do, you will perform the creation of work as well, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>Yeah. I mean, that happened by accident. It was a weird thing that I didn't think anybody would be interested in, actually, you know, viewing my art wire, I'm, I'm painting, but of course I paint very fast. I'm not a artist that likes to, you know, labor over a painting over days, over weeks, over months. For me, I want to get it done in that album time or, you know, the album repeated. Yeah. Because I'm just trying to go with flow of music. I don't wanna think about it. I don't wanna look at detail. I just want the feeling of that music to come out. And so it's very fast. And, you know, it's quite visual. It happened that I, I went to a great art gallery, which unfortunately is now closed in Birmingham, in, in England, and proposed that they might like to stock my artwork, which they actually did, which was very nice. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>And they, they really liked the practice, and they asked whether I'd paint live outside their gallery to show people the process, because I'd, I'd actually sh I showed them the, original video of painting Gold is incredible. <span style="color:red" data-ts="406.925" data-end_ts="407.245" title="406.925" id=c_"406.925">__Sandra__</span> Drummond Bass, which is a very, if you've seen that video, it's very <span style="color:red" data-ts="409.925" data-end_ts="410.165" title="409.925" id=c_"409.925">__course__</span>. It was literally my girlfriend at the time, who's <span style="color:red" data-ts="412.845" data-end_ts="412.925" title="412.845" id=c_"412.845">__now__</span> my wife. She just had a camera with her and she sort of shot it. And, you know, it's, it's not great at all. But I, fortunately she did because I, you know, I had that, and, and I actually showed the gallery that, and they sort of loved that process. And then I, you know, I painted live and people got to know about that. And, it sort of took off from there. And it, and it's weird really when you're painting live, because when I'm painting in the studio, you know, there's some things that don't work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>You know, I paint and they just don't work, and they just have to go. 'cause you know, obviously I filter my workout and only the, my best work gets shown. I'm fortunate enough to, for it to be able to work. Most of the times it's weird painting life. 'cause you always hope <laugh> that the piece is gonna turn out well in front of people as well, you know, <laugh>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="461.605" data-end_ts="461.685" title="461.605" id=c_"461.605">__right__</span>? And, but I've got to the point now that, well, I say I got to the point, but I've always, once I start painting, there's like, there's nothing around me. I just don't acknowledge anything. I'm absolutely in that painting, and nerves or painting in front of people, just, it, it doesn't even register. It's not there because when I go into this painting motion, a lot of artists will describe this in music and in artwork, I just hit this flow energy and I'm in, you know, and that's it. And you know, time just goes, it evaporates, you know? I feel like I've only been doing it 10 minutes and it'll be an hour and a half down down the road. So it's quite interesting, you know, to be able to do that live. Whether, whether it bos people or not, I'm not sure. But, people tend to stay around and watch. That's good. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's interesting because there are so many parallels between what you're talking about and what a musician in the same spot would experience, right? So if you're doing, I mean, you're improvising. It's not like you're coming with a paint by numbers, <laugh>, you know, kind of art piece in mind. But also, there, there are a lot of parallels. You have to be confident enough in your style and confident enough in the tools you have at hand to know that you can pull it off. You have to be fairly confident that you're gonna be able to make something that's interesting to look at and interesting to watch being created. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And, it is very much different from a studio practice. And I mean, it's interesting that, you know, painters and musicians use the same, name for their working space, a studio, because the practices there are very much different than what these live practices are, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>Yeah, they are. They've got a different flavor and feel, and I'm guessing, I, I do wanna actually go forward and, and, and do some live performances musically as well, for the future. But I'm guessing it's very much like playing live compared to in the studio. And it's that thing that, you know, I I, I've been painting this way for 14 years now. And for people, you know, obviously people don't know my process, but I'm throwing a lot of paint around. I use several processes. So the main process is let's get some paint on that canvas and let's get it on fast, and let's get it onto the beat and rhythm of the music. Right. And that's the, the first process. And, but there's a, a, like a three layer process to that. So like, I'll prime, I'll, sort of paint the prime so it stains in, then just wait <span style="color:red" data-ts="624.125" data-end_ts="624.245" title="624.125" id=c_"624.125">__a__</span> while, then I'll cover that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>And then I'll do a lot of painting, which is, you know, a lot of paint going on. And then I use gravity then to actually take the paint down the canvas, so it looks like it's actually sliding down the canvas. And then I use a piece of, in my case it's Perspex, <span style="color:red" data-ts="642.445" data-end_ts="642.565" title="642.445" id=c_"642.445">__a__</span> piece of acrylic sheeting. And then I drag back into the paint to reveal the layers underneath. So there's a, a lot of throne of paint around them, because I've been doing it so long. <span style="color:red" data-ts="655.505" data-end_ts="655.725" title="655.505" id=c_"655.505">__You__</span>, I just know <span style="color:red" data-ts="657.265" data-end_ts="657.485" title="657.265" id=c_"657.265">__how__</span>, you know, how that works, how that goes, how what I need to do. Like nor painters when they're <span style="color:red" data-ts="663.505" data-end_ts="663.725" title="663.505" id=c_"663.505">__the__</span>, how you, you get, you know, a, a perspective or a, I think a feeling within painting is layers, you know? Yeah. And I, and I don't, I can't afford anything in music as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>It's all, you know, building up of layers. And I can't afford to wait for it to dry 'cause I'm doing all this wet and I'm doing all this fast. So I tend to build wet layers on top of wet layers. And so I know when I have to hit hard to punch colors through Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> I know when I need to do, you know, do it light so the colors will float. So it gets symmetry and color balance. And I'm trying to build these wet layers of paint up, to give the painting some depth rather than waiting for a layer to dry, put another layer on layer to dry. So, I think like your practice in a studio, you would, you know, you can have several takes. You can polish it, you can put a compressor on it, and you can do all that nice stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>When I'm in the studio, I've got the time to, you know, really, manipulate it to, to, to, to the extreme. When I'm painting live, it's, it is more raw, you know, and, it is sort of more seat of the pants and you are sort of, you're sort of taking the energy of what's around you as well, because obviously, you know, with music and with artwork, I'm a very space in orientated person. I find that spaces really affect how I feel our paint. So obviously you're sort of taking that on board. So I would, you know, I would feel that, it's sort of close to a musician's practice where they're, they're, they're doing it in the studio, but then they're doing it live. And of course it's very more, it's much more exciting doing it live too 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and much like, you know, on the musician's side, from the art side, you also have a pretty heavy, a pretty heavy, load of risk involved in terms of, you know, one false move and the wheels can come off, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>Yeah. And you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="790.705" data-end_ts="790.925" title="790.705" id=c_"790.705">__it__</span>, you're dealing with, you know, sort of logistics as you've said before. I'm not painted by numbers. I, I'm literally going with a guttal feeling. You know, I, I always say it's sort of like a prime evil <span style="color:red" data-ts="803.085" data-end_ts="803.405" title="803.085" id=c_"803.085">__feeling__</span>, feeling really. And so there's plenty of room for mistakes <laugh> and things to, to, to go wrong in that process. But I, I dunno, I love it. I, I love them both. I love my studio work, but I do, I do enjoy painting live as well, because, I think there's something isn't <span style="color:red" data-ts="822.005" data-end_ts="822.285" title="822.005" id=c_"822.005">__there__</span> about when you <span style="color:red" data-ts="823.925" data-end_ts="824.125" title="823.925" id=c_"823.925">__do__</span> anything live that you are at that ragged edge and the adrenaline flows and, you know, you do get sort of a kick <span style="color:red" data-ts="832.665" data-end_ts="832.885" title="832.665" id=c_"832.665">__out__</span> of that. I, I think, you know, and I, I mean, I'm not saying in, I'm performing in for thousands of people, you know, there's only a few people there. Yeah. I don't think it's part of that. I think it's the occasion and, you know, wanting to get that right within that sort of, set occasion. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Indeed. I have like 900 questions <laugh> to go to, to get into already. But also in addition to doing the paint, you have started to delve into your own music creation practice as well, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>Yeah. So this started when I was a kid, really. I, my first ever keyboard was, the old <span style="color:red" data-ts="870.765" data-end_ts="870.885" title="870.765" id=c_"870.765">__v__</span> Casio <span style="color:red" data-ts="871.555" data-end_ts="871.845" title="871.555" id=c_"871.555">__Vone__</span>, remember the VL one? Oh, yeah, absolutely. And I bought one of those, and that was my, I mean, it was around the eighties and I was getting into a lot of new romantic music at the moment, early human league, that type of stuff, right? And, I, I got this <span style="color:red" data-ts="887.145" data-end_ts="887.365" title="887.145" id=c_"887.145">__VR__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="887.515" data-end_ts="887.805" title="887.515" id=c_"887.515">__tone__</span> and just absolutely enjoyed it. And you could, I don't even remember. You could, could actually program the sounds by putting numbers in for the A DSR and that type of thing. And, so I quite got into that. And then I thought I'd up the bu a Casio, mt <span style="color:red" data-ts="902.365" data-end_ts="902.645" title="902.365" id=c_"902.365">__four__</span> <laugh>. These weren't <laugh>, these weren't, you know, powerful machines. But, then I, I did a trade at school, I remember for, a, small stones <span style="color:red" data-ts="913.155" data-end_ts="913.445" title="913.155" id=c_"913.155">__face__</span> shifter and put that on the end of the, on, on the end of the brass, on, on this Mt. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>Fourteener. I was like, whoa, look, listen to that, you know, going through my rubbish old keyboard speaker, right? And then I sort of built up, an arsal of, of these, vl ones programmed some baselines on them. I mean, obviously there wasn't <span style="color:red" data-ts="934.285" data-end_ts="934.445" title="934.285" id=c_"934.285">__mid__</span> or anything, but I just used to copy the same sequence and slightly de-tune them. So I suppose that was my first two oscillators to synthesizer <laugh>. So I just, I just used to love messing around, you know, when I <span style="color:red" data-ts="947.885" data-end_ts="947.925" title="947.885" id=c_"947.885">__was__</span> a kid, my first proper synth was, <span style="color:red" data-ts="951.125" data-end_ts="951.245" title="951.125" id=c_"951.125">__a__</span> Mhar CS <span style="color:red" data-ts="952.005" data-end_ts="952.085" title="952.005" id=c_"952.005">__O__</span> five. And then I sort of, you know, I had the obligatory group with my, my mate in the back room, but just remembered joyfully these years of doing all that. And I sort of lost touch with that. You know, you start, you know, working for a living and things start taking over your life. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>And I sort of lost it, really. And then around about three years ago, I just thought within my practice that, look, I'm painting to other people's music and sound, which I absolutely love, and this is what I believe about your artwork as well. You should paint what you love. Right? You know? Right. What, what is, what is within you as a person? And music has always been, listening to music has always been within me as a person. It's always been there in my life to go through good times and bad times of, I've always loved and, you know, turned to music. And then I thought, well, wow, when I was a kid, I absolutely loved messing around with my synthesizer. What if, what if I do something with that? What if I now bring that into my practice and have this sort of loop of creating music in the genre that I'd like to create it, and then paint that. And, and that's when I sort of started on the slippery slope <laugh> of getting back into, into synths. And, that's, that has been around about three years ago. And I have to say, it's just, it's just been, it's just been a great journey from then. It's really starting to add to what I'm doing as, as an artist. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Now what you started off with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1047.955" data-end_ts="1048.245" title="1047.955" id=c_"1047.955">__Vone__</span>, and I am assuming you're not using those again. What are you using for synth now? <laugh>? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>No, well, it was a lovely story actually. So I, I started sort of going, okay, well, you know, what, what's happening in the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1059.965" data-end_ts="1060.205" title="1059.965" id=c_"1059.965">__synth__</span> world now? And then go into it and, and, and found out there's this great big analog resurgence, this modular resurgence. And I'm like, wow, I've hit this at the right time. <laugh>, you know, <laugh>, you know, and just things aligned because like if I'd done this 15 years ago, it wouldn't have been as interesting, you know, but now all this stuff's happening. And, I think what really struck me is I was looking around and I think Moog had just done a, a video on, you know, the reissuing some of their whole modular stuff. And, right, there was a, a thing by Suzanne Charlie on there, and she was saying, saying this, she was saying like, the first time around, you know, modular came out. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>It was amazing. You know, artists took it on. 'cause as you, as you know, with the history, there was, you know, at first, especially with the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1106.625" data-end_ts="1106.845" title="1106.625" id=c_"1106.625">__LER__</span> sort of era, it was all about, okay, let, let's use this as arts. I mean, so, so that really interests me. You know, let's have sound for sound, sound for creativity, sound for heart, right? And then obviously it, it gets melded into sort of, normal musical practices as well. And she was saying that like, it was taken away from us too early. You know, the digital revolution came and suddenly this, this, the artistic modular revolution sort of died and now it's coming back, you know? And she feels, there's so much to still discover, you know, she said, I'm so glad it's back. 'cause there's so much to do, so much to discover. And I feel that's right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>So I thought, right, okay. Modular is then <laugh>. So I think, oh, I know a bit about synthesis. I might have been a bit wrong there because I, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1159.685" data-end_ts="1159.845" title="1159.685" id=c_"1159.685">__started__</span>, I started doing all my, sort of looking around on, on on the net and there's this thing called, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1166.405" data-end_ts="1166.525" title="1166.405" id=c_"1166.405">__a__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1166.605" data-end_ts="1166.725" title="1166.605" id=c_"1166.605">__a__</span> stocks deluxe by a company called Analog Solutions. And it, it looks like it could launch missiles from a Russian submarine. I mean, it looks amazing. It's got this, obviously, it's, if, you know, if he was walking around in, in a place that you shouldn't be, I'm sure people would think, what is going on with that? <span style="color:red" data-ts="1184.885" data-end_ts="1185.085" title="1184.885" id=c_"1184.885">__Right__</span>? I mean, it's got pin matrix system. Yeah. It, it's, it's a very wild thing. And I just fell in love with the look of this. Now, at the time, I couldn't afford this piece. But I got in touch with Tom Carpenter and basically, van Analog Solutions, who I think we're quite one of the original modular guys, I think, you know, of 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The Renaissance. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>Yeah. He didn't start long after Dour, I don't think. I mean, I, I talked to Tom now and I think his art and his love is actually making whole systems rather than modular, systems. 'cause he hasn't got a whole raft of modular. He loves making systems, I think. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1220.565" data-end_ts="1220.805" title="1220.565" id=c_"1220.565">__Right__</span>? But I, I got in touch with him and I said, look, I, I'm, I'm an artist. I wanna get back into synthesis. I'm looking at all what you have there. You know, can I, could I meet up? 'cause he didn't live too far away, which was quite amazing 60 miles away from me, you know, and maybe, you know, have a chat and see what you think might be good to start with. And I said, look, I, I dunno even whether I wanna make music, I think I just want to be creative with something and see <span style="color:red" data-ts="1247.485" data-end_ts="1247.685" title="1247.485" id=c_"1247.485">__where__</span> it takes me. So he got back to me, he said, yeah, yeah, that's great. Come on over. And then he got back to me a day later and he went, just have a look at your website. He said, I really like your artwork. He said, more importantly, my wife really likes your artwork, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>Do you fancy doing an exchange for equipment? And I was like, wow, wow. This, you know, you know, when you do things Darwin and it's sort of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1273.095" data-end_ts="1273.445" title="1273.095" id=c_"1273.095">__faded__</span> and things roll and without you pushing it, it just happens. Yep. And I was thinking, okay, something's happening here. And so, you know, at first he was gonna swap <span style="color:red" data-ts="1282.085" data-end_ts="1282.205" title="1282.085" id=c_"1282.085">__a__</span> small piece of artwork for one of his, you know, really sort of small sims. And then, so I took, I said, look, have a few, see what your wife thinks. 'cause I paint on Perspex, I paint on Canvas, I dunno what she'll like. And then he got back to me and went, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1295.365" data-end_ts="1295.565" title="1295.365" id=c_"1295.365">__ah__</span>, the problem, she likes them all, <laugh> <laugh>. And so he said, you know, could we do something? And, I, I said, well, it's not gonna be far off the, the price of your ox deluxe. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>What, what, what do you think? And he went, yeah, I'm up for that. So I did a swap for this thing that I fell in love with, visually, you know, and we, we did a swap. And that is my, my first foray back into synthesis, which is fully modular. It's, you know, it doesn't follow the Euro rack formatting as in sizing. It's a, it's a, you know, it's a, I've got this thing for luggage as well, Darwin, if you put a synthesizer in a case, I'm there. I love it. You know, <laugh>, I just, I, I can't, I can't help myself, you know, I love them. I love them all. You know, it is like a sort of a, a metal suitcase, right. Synthesizer full of modules that you have to patch. So I I dash <span style="color:red" data-ts="1350.665" data-end_ts="1350.885" title="1350.665" id=c_"1350.665">__am__</span> thinking, great, you know, we're in a couple of weeks, I'm gonna be doing this great experimental music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>It's all gonna be amazing. And as you know, proceeded to get sort of weird growling sounds out of it for about year, you know, and, and, and not knowing, you know, you think you know about synthesis when you have got synthesize that's been normalized and everything's all hunky <span style="color:red" data-ts="1374.285" data-end_ts="1374.445" title="1374.285" id=c_"1374.285">__door__</span> and you, you know, you, you turn those knobs and everything's within a nice range as well. But when you get on modular, you know, you don't know about synthesis at that point, do you? Or I didn't. Anyway, it was a long learning curve then to learn, you know, about synthesis, about modular and, you know, where I, I was gonna take, take sort of that going forward. So, I have a few syn now, but that was my, my first one back into it, which <span style="color:red" data-ts="1401.285" data-end_ts="1401.525" title="1401.285" id=c_"1401.285">__were__</span> a bit different from the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1403.305" data-end_ts="1403.525" title="1403.305" id=c_"1403.305">__VL__</span> one. Darwin. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. A bit different for sure. I just pulled up a picture of the, the Vostok deluxe and wow, what a, what a reentry system. <laugh>. It's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>Wow, Darwin. I couldn't believe it, honestly. I, I got it home and I just, I dribbled over it for <laugh> for, for a couple of days, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1422.645" data-end_ts="1422.925" title="1422.645" id=c_"1422.645">__Lord__</span>, look at that. That's brilliant, isn't it? And then proceeded to get no sand out of it. Yeah. But no, it, it's, it's a, it's a, I mean, I, I can't say that, you know, I know about all the systems and all the simps that are out there, obviously, you know, I'm going to things like super Booo and that where you, you sort of test a lot of stuff out. But, the Vos stocks is, I call it the, the Screaming Banshee. Because <span style="color:red" data-ts="1447.285" data-end_ts="1447.405" title="1447.285" id=c_"1447.285">__a__</span>, you put anything over free and it just loves to go hot on you and do, do wild, wild things. And, it's got the, the cog, filter in it, the high pass, low pass, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1463.065" data-end_ts="1463.285" title="1463.065" id=c_"1463.065">__So__</span> really well it's not the cog filter, but 'cause know it's similar. Right, right. It's similar sort of topology to that. So it's like a very raw filter. And then you, you know, you start bringing the, the, the matrix into it and sort of, if you patch a patch with your cords and then actually do the same patch with, with a matrix, you start getting this different timbers and bleeding. And I can only say, I thought it was gonna be an easy journey for me, and it was gonna be like electric guitar. I was gonna plug it in and be able to strum a few chords. And actually it turned out to be a violin. And actually that violin, I, I didn't know I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1502.525" data-end_ts="1502.565" title="1502.525" id=c_"1502.525">__had__</span> to tune that violin. And I think that's how <span style="color:red" data-ts="1504.325" data-end_ts="1504.485" title="1504.325" id=c_"1504.325">__it__</span> <laugh>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1505.165" data-end_ts="1505.285" title="1505.165" id=c_"1505.165">__I__</span>, I think that's how I would say my journey with it has been. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>But it's been beautiful in a way because you just find out all these weird nuances and you know, that, that, that happens with it. I, I probably wouldn't suggest it as a first synth, if I, if I was gonna do it again. But it certainly is, is learnt me a lot about synthesis. And it's learnt me a lot that, you know, we all, well, I think people outside of synthesis think of, you know, it's electric, it's analog, you know, it's analog, but it's electric. So therefore what you do is what you get, you know? Right. And surely, surely something else was saying the same on the, the other thing. And when you start playing with these things, you realize they're living and breathing. They are as analog as <span style="color:red" data-ts="1552.525" data-end_ts="1552.645" title="1552.525" id=c_"1552.525">__a__</span> violin. And certainly in this case, you know, this, this thing is, so, it's, it's been a bit of a baptism by fire, but a, a nice one. If, if, if I can say that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it just seems like a really neat box, full of parts to work with too. I mean, it, it may not be the best. Well, maybe it is the best for synthesizer though, in that, you have all the pieces there as long as you allow yourself not to have to use 'em all. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>Yeah. I mean, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1580.145" data-end_ts="1580.365" title="1580.145" id=c_"1580.145">__you__</span>, you know, so I got a load of wires and started plugging 'em in everywhere, and <laugh> and, got <span style="color:red" data-ts="1587.755" data-end_ts="1588.045" title="1587.755" id=c_"1587.755">__what__</span> noise I think it was. But yeah, I think if you start with those simple patches, it, it really, you know, it learns you a lot. The other thing, and this is the same in my artwork too, is, you know, you all think, oh, right, I'm gonna use all three oscillators. You know, you wanna use everything on there. Yeah. And you start realizing very soon that too much is too much. And, you know, you start pairing back and there's a beautiful in, in minimalism and pairing things back. And it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1618.805" data-end_ts="1618.885" title="1618.805" id=c_"1618.805">__the__</span> same in the pro <span style="color:red" data-ts="1619.865" data-end_ts="1620.085" title="1619.865" id=c_"1619.865">__you__</span> painting process. When you first start, you throwing everything in the kitchen, sink, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1623.205" data-end_ts="1623.485" title="1623.205" id=c_"1623.205">__carrot__</span>, and it, you know, it looks a mess at the end of the day. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>And then you start pairing back your process and refining your process, and you start ending up with something that's legible to <span style="color:red" data-ts="1634.045" data-end_ts="1634.205" title="1634.045" id=c_"1634.045">__play__</span> in front of people to, to see. And actually, weirdly, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1637.115" data-end_ts="1637.405" title="1637.115" id=c_"1637.115">__Lynn__</span>, I'm finding my synth journey pretty much the same as my art journey that, I didn't start showing my artwork until I thought I would like, I'd look at that on a wall and think, oh yeah, that's good artwork. And that sort of took a three year process and it's been about two and a half years with the Vostok and other stuff. And now, and I still quite haven't found where I want to go with it in my voice, but I'm getting there. I know I'm close. I know, I know. I'm close to going forward with, with that. It's quite an interesting, the music and art, I just, the, the very symbiotic, because I'm finding as well, I'm using the same creative process as I am with painting. And I'm guessing <span style="color:red" data-ts="1683.065" data-end_ts="1683.285" title="1683.065" id=c_"1683.065">__if__</span>, if you're a multi creative, like you'd like to be creative with any tool that you get. Like for me, I, I love video editing and I'm, I, you know, I love, graphic design and I love sound and, you know, I love painting. I'm not saying I'm good at all those, but I enjoy those and I can get something <span style="color:red" data-ts="1699.845" data-end_ts="1700.125" title="1699.845" id=c_"1699.845">__carried__</span> those. And I tend to use the same creative process. So I found that quite interesting that they're, the transferable between, between the two. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So we talked a little bit about how you got to your place as from the music side. How about from the, the painting and the visual arts side? What was your process there? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>Well, how I got to where, where you are. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's a long weird journey, really. So I'm gonna try and do a quick whistle <span style="color:red" data-ts="1728.945" data-end_ts="1729.165" title="1728.945" id=c_"1728.945">__top__</span> stop here. Really. I would love to say, you know, when I was five, I, I picked up a paint and brush and knew, knew that was what I was gonna do for the rest of my life. And to be fair, I, I'm, so, I'm not saying envious 'cause that's not a nice word, but, I love when people, their life has followed that path, I think. Wow, how beautiful, to do that. Mine, I didn't know what I was gonna do. I mean, I was this dyslexic kid in, you know, late seventies in a inner city school that was not a very good school that I didn't find any inspirational teachers there. You know, some people's lives are turned by someone who's inspirational that turns around and goes, oh, you can do this. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>And so <span style="color:red" data-ts="1770.165" data-end_ts="1770.285" title="1770.165" id=c_"1770.165">__I__</span> didn't have that. So I left education very dismayed about, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1775.815" data-end_ts="1776.165" title="1775.815" id=c_"1775.815">__about__</span> it all. So didn't want to go into <span style="color:red" data-ts="1777.525" data-end_ts="1777.725" title="1777.525" id=c_"1777.525">__higher__</span> education. I decided the best way for, for me to make my mark was to go out and make money and, you know, be successful in a career to show people I was good. But the problem with that is I'm a creative, really, actually what I wanted to be was when I was a kid, was just a mad inventor that, you know, did stuff with stuff. I mean, my, my, my granddad was, used to fix valve radios and when he passed away, I was very young, but when he passed away, I inherited lots of like amp meters and, you know, things. And I used to have microphones that twirled around with motors and, you know, and I used to just love being a mad inventor. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>But, unfortunately anything creative didn't really, you know, the school and the education at that time didn't really follow that type of philosophy. Right. So off to work, I went, you know, being, I suppose channeled my creativity into listening to music. I mean, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1830.045" data-end_ts="1830.165" title="1830.045" id=c_"1830.045">__I__</span> just absolutely love collecting and, and listening to music and went on, you know, my, my musical journey that way, with creativity. And then mid twenties started painting just sort of part-time because you know, when it's in you, it's in you, isn't it? It comes out, yeah, absolutely. At some stage, you know, and I really liked that. And people used to say, oh, that's, you know, that's really good. Looking back on it, it wasn't, but, you know, people used to say that. And what sort of happened is slowly but surely, I got dismayed with, you know, I was an account manager. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>I got <span style="color:red" data-ts="1863.665" data-end_ts="1863.885" title="1863.665" id=c_"1863.665">__de__</span> dismayed with the normal life of going, and, you know, making money in a normal, what I call sort of a normal job. And I was doing really well, at that. But, deep down I wasn't, you know, I was a creative and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1880.765" data-end_ts="1881.045" title="1880.765" id=c_"1880.765">__over__</span> weekends I would do creative stuff just to draw a breath if, if you like. So, I was late, late twenties and, dunno whether you think heard of the thing called Saturn returns, that surely hit me. It's like, you know, Saturn comes back every 30 years, it's in the same place. And people say that you reevaluate your life at that point. And I, cer certainly did. You know, I just thought, I'm a creative person. I've gotta be creative. I've gotta do something major here. So I saved up as much money as I could that I could scrape through three years of not having to earn any money. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>I gave up a great job, and sold everything up so I could just plunge myself into arts and, and being creative. 'cause I had this, I had, I had this vision that I could do it, you know? Now weirdly enough, I think if I had my time again, I might have thought about going to the university route <span style="color:red" data-ts="1941.985" data-end_ts="1942.205" title="1941.985" id=c_"1941.985">__pre__</span> 'cause I've probably got a body of work at that point that I could have gone look, you know, can I go to Sure to go here and, and study art? I didn't, I dunno quite why I think still, you know, still didn't quite like the, maybe he was from the education system when I was a kid. Didn't wanna go down that route. So I decided to head down to a place called Penzance. There was, some great old artists that used to have a, enclave of, abstract work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>And I love abstract work, in St. Ives. And I thought, I'm just gonna go down there. I'm gonna lock myself in a, a, you know, in a studio and see what I can do. And that's what I did. When I thought things were happening for me, I moved back to Birmingham 'cause Birmingham's a bigger city. And, I got to the point where I thought, okay, I think I've got something to say here. It was at the point of, you know, you go through lots of, you know, lots of different phases of thinking, you know where you want to go. And I think suddenly you hit on something and, you know, that's where you're going. You know, that's, that's your road. And I thought, okay, I've got something to say here. And that's when I started approaching galleries. And the first gallery I approached was quite a big one in, in Birmingham. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>And I, I, I got that straight away. And, and things started really moving for me very fast then. So what I'm gonna say here is, you know, I I didn't start full-time art until my thirties. I'm a self-taught artist. And the road has just opened up for me from then on. And I've, I've just been very lucky with how things have happened. I've had the pleasure of, stumbling into, an American architect who love my <span style="color:red" data-ts="2050.365" data-end_ts="2050.565" title="2050.365" id=c_"2050.365">__art__</span> artwork, this, and this is very early stage. I'd, I'd literally what I would call, say, been painting for galleries for six months at this stage. And weirdly enough, another quick story is, well probably won't be quick, Darwin, sorry about this. But, it's, I, I was painting, it was the time that I was painting live outside this gallery who'd just taken me on. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>And the piece was so big that I said, have we got anywhere to drag this in? And they knew the owners of the, the shopping complex, which by the way is a very high-end shi shopping complex. You go all like, you know, your high <span style="color:red" data-ts="2085.045" data-end_ts="2085.365" title="2085.045" id=c_"2085.045">__design__</span> shops within this place. And they had this, this shop that nobody was in. So they, they dragged it into there. And I just got talking to, to these people. 'cause I love talking art and I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2095.805" data-end_ts="2096.045" title="2095.805" id=c_"2095.805">__love__</span>, one of the things that I love is to try and bring art to the masses, which is another turning. We can't go down 'cause we don't have time to talk about that. But I'm a great believer in, taking the snobbery out of art and, you know, just, you know, getting it out to people. And so we, I was talking about this and, and the guys who own the complex said, look, would you like to do some painting in here? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>Show your paint work, show your process, to just people that walked past in here. So the, the rent Darwin in this place would've been thousands of pounds a month, you know? Right. And they, these guys just gave it me, you know, and they just said, look, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2132.905" data-end_ts="2133.125" title="2132.905" id=c_"2132.905">__it__</span>, it's interesting what you are you are doing, and we want to have interesting things within our complex. Sure. And your said, they said, look, you can't sell from there. But my gallery was only, you know, four shops up. But if you could, you know, show people what you do, we'd love it. So I was there for six months. It was tremendous because, you know, people walk through the door, I go into like, you know, Hugo Boss, and then they'll walk through my door and they'll go, oh, I'm not too sure what, what, what is this? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>And they said, oh, <laugh>, I'm like an artist in residence. Oh, we dunno anything about art. And I go, you don't need to just come in, let, let me explain. I said like, just sit in front of that piece of artwork and just say, do you like it <span style="color:red" data-ts="2177.885" data-end_ts="2178.045" title="2177.885" id=c_"2177.885">__all__</span>? Don't you? And that's your first starting with art, you know, it's whether it connects with you or whether you don't, you know, as, again, I don't like the, you know, the, the sort of snobbery in art and people being put off by that. So it was, it was great in that dimension. But weirdly enough, a guy from America on his holiday came round, had a look at my artwork. I just happened to be there. It's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2200.005" data-end_ts="2200.245" title="2200.005" id=c_"2200.005">__fade__</span> again. And he went, I love your artwork. He said, I'm doing commission and I'd like to commission you for a piece of artwork. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>But I was doing it on Perspex at the time. He said, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2210.295" data-end_ts="2210.645" title="2210.295" id=c_"2210.295">__could__</span>, could you do it on glass? I said, I haven't tried. He said, right, okay, let's see if we can do this. And then he left and we exchanged cards. And you know what it's like, you know these things. Well never, you know from him again. Right. Yeah. You know, you know, until he materializes, you never go mad about it. And then a week later, he got in touch with me, he said, right, ed, I'm flying you over to Canada. There's big glass foundries in Canada that I work with. I want you to see if it'll work on glass. So amazing. This, this guy was totally amazing. Flew me over to Canada, met me at the Glass Foundry. We did a few test pieces, yet it worked on glass in, and then we went back over. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>We sort <span style="color:red" data-ts="2249.565" data-end_ts="2249.725" title="2249.565" id=c_"2249.565">__of__</span> talked to each other for about a year to decide what we were gonna do for it. Flew me back over to Canada again. Produced the piece, on glass <span style="color:red" data-ts="2259.145" data-end_ts="2259.365" title="2259.145" id=c_"2259.145">__two__</span>, two layered, piece of glass. And it now hangs in one of his monolithic domes in Birmingham, Alabama. I think, that story, I'm gonna say just my road has been one of the right opportunities, the right time, a bit of luck and a lot of hard work and, you know, literally giving up everything and put <span style="color:red" data-ts="2277.205" data-end_ts="2277.405" title="2277.205" id=c_"2277.205">__in__</span> pretty much my life on the line, to try and become an artist. And fortunately, it's sort of worked out as, as a, you know, I've sort of smuggled through, if you like. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well that's a, that's an astounding story. And, and one that really comes from a lot of different things. I mean, you put yourself in a position to be kind of an ambassador for art. Right. But also, and, and this is something I know just from my own practice and my own work with other people, so many people are scared to let let you see their work before it's polished like a diamond, right? Yeah. Yeah. And it seems like you ha were willing to be kind of, to kind of reveal your process and reveal your, your work style and reveal that. And that actually put you in the position to have the success that you have. You wouldn't have had that if you would've been hiding in your studio. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>No, no. And I'm, I, I'm this person that believes in, you have to put yourself in uncomfortable positions to grow as a person. I mean, again, it, I, when I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2342.885" data-end_ts="2343.005" title="2342.885" id=c_"2342.885">__hit__</span> my thirties, I, I got into all the, the books on how you can be the best person you can be, you know, the Tony Robbins type of stuff and that type of stuff. You know, and you know, you know, reading all the books, how to win the influence, how to win Friends and Influence People, all those, you know, those great sort of like how you can become the best person you can be. And I'm not saying I'm anywhere near and it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2363.045" data-end_ts="2363.165" title="2363.045" id=c_"2363.045">__hard__</span>, you know, like it's hard to change your, the way you are as a person and, and produce new routines. But I'm a great believer in trying to push as much as you can, do as much as you can. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>And, you know, try and put yourself in positions of, of sometimes fear because you sort of grow <span style="color:red" data-ts="2381.425" data-end_ts="2381.645" title="2381.425" id=c_"2381.425">__and__</span> you know, all these people say that. And you know, it's muted in a lot of religions as well that, you know, to to, to grow as a person. You've gotta go to places you wouldn't go. And I'm sort of a believer in that. I'm a believer as well in talking to people and showing them process. I mean, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2396.805" data-end_ts="2396.925" title="2396.805" id=c_"2396.805">__I__</span>, I know I think, you know, I've met a few artists that would never ever show you their reveal, their process, how they get to where they are. And I think, you know what, I, I, I've sort of got this feeling that I'm gonna grow as an artist and I'll show people my process now. And if people want to do that process, that's fine. 'cause I'm moving on, you know, my process will move on. Right, right. And like, so if somebody wants to copy me, that's fine, because they'll be copying me to, by the time <span style="color:red" data-ts="2425.885" data-end_ts="2426.085" title="2425.885" id=c_"2425.885">__they__</span> get 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You a frozen piece of time. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>Yeah. And by the time they get up to what I'm doing, I'm gonna be gone on <span style="color:red" data-ts="2432.405" data-end_ts="2432.725" title="2432.405" id=c_"2432.405">__three__</span> years and you know that I'm gonna be doing something different by then. And I just feel being open with, with process people, so engaged with you with it. You know, they just, when they see, oh, I didn't know you, you did that. And I mean, I get this weird thing, you know, I finish it and people clap and it's like, you know, whoa, whoa. That's a bit weird, isn't it? <laugh>, you know. But yeah, it took me back at first, you know, it's like a weird thing to do at the end of painting. But, just people love seeing the process. They love seeing what goes on behind it, you know? And I love to show that too, you know, and I think that's, and it's all this thing as well, about trying to open apart. I mean, I know we're doing a lot <span style="color:red" data-ts="2472.725" data-end_ts="2473.005" title="2472.725" id=c_"2472.725">__Eric__</span> of it now and the last 10 years I think people have come on leaps and bounds. I mean, we've got the Tate <span style="color:red" data-ts="2478.085" data-end_ts="2478.245" title="2478.085" id=c_"2478.085">__in__</span>, in the UK here, that's done a lot to open up the arts to, you know, underprivileged <span style="color:red" data-ts="2483.445" data-end_ts="2483.485" title="2483.445" id=c_"2483.445">__kids__</span>. Such 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>An amazing place. Yeah. It's unreal. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>Yeah. Yeah. I mean, because I was, when I was a kid, I had no, I was culture devoid. I mean, what would've happened if I was plunged in this culture when I was a kid? And again, you know, I'm not sort of saying, oh, I'm downtrodden. 'cause again, I don't believe in that <laugh>. I believe in you. I, I believe in you are what you've made yourself to be. Right. And if you wanna change, you change it yourself. It's not down to what's happened or where you've been or what you've done. You know, you've made those decisions. I'm a great believer in that. But worry, what if, you know, I've been plunged into this, you know, sea of culture that age. You know, would I, would I have picked up that earlier? Would I have been in a different mode now? And so to be able to strip away, I think the, the highbrow part of art, so kids get involved. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>So, you know, there isn't any mystique about it, you know, and there it becomes like the run of the mill, which it isn't at the moment still. And I mean, that's what I love about music. I mean, music is every bit as talented as, you know, 'cause it's a creative process as an artist is they're using similar, similar things to get where they wanna be. You know, the good rises to the top and the bad doesn't, you know? And you've got all these things that are very, very similar to music, but music is loved and adored by everybody. 'cause it's accessible. Yet the same creative process is hidden and not loved and adored by the masses when it should be. You know? And I really blame, I really blame the, I think as artists, you know, we're to blame as much as the gut highend galleries and, you know, the snobbery and the money that's involved with that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>I think some, some artists, and, you know, again, everyone's to their own, you'll read some statements of what they're trying to do. And as an artist, I just don't understand what that is. You know, because they're using words, you know, that I find hard to sort of get my head round and <laugh>, you know, find out what their practice is. And so I think when the normal run of the mill people, but up against that, they just think, oh, this is just too high. Brag. Yeah. And that's, that's why I say Darwin. I mean, we could go into, you know, the visceral part of music that, you know, music's in being in every culture. It's, it's been in every tribe that, that, that visceral drum of the beat, the, the, the beautiful sounds of people singing, you know, it's been in humanity, it's been in our genetics through throughout time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>You know, it's, you know, it's got that sort of lovely, lovely sort of feel to it. And I could wax on lyrical about, you know, why I paint to music and the deeper side of that. But whenever I see people, I just go, what do you do? I paint music. Yeah, yeah. I, I I listen to the flow <span style="color:red" data-ts="2647.005" data-end_ts="2647.085" title="2647.005" id=c_"2647.005">__in__</span> the beat of music and I express it and I paint it, and then we can have a deeper conversation from that, because that hooks people in there. Right. That's a good watching point, right? Yeah. Yeah. Because, you know, you, you don't walk up to a person and go, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2660.945" data-end_ts="2661.165" title="2660.945" id=c_"2660.945">__oh__</span>, I love you. Can I marry you? And, and proceed to kiss them? Do you <laugh> <laugh>, it's, you wouldn't do that, would you? Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Every time I tried it, it didn't work out so well, <laugh>. No, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>It never did for me. I gave up and, and it's the same when you, you are talking to somebody about music or, or art, you know, first of all, you get in with the hook, you know, you talk to a person and you like that person, therefore you ask a bit more about their history. And then, you know, you might go out on a date and you learn more about them. And they're, they're quite interesting. But you wouldn't lay that on that person all in one. And I feel the art industry does that. It lays it all out for you to try and understand in one millisecond of you walking up to that piece of artwork. And that is what puts people off. And because we haven't got this visceral thing like music just, you know, actually physically connects with you. But we have, with the, the visual effects, I mean, artwork, you know, just draws me <span style="color:red" data-ts="2718.765" data-end_ts="2718.925" title="2718.765" id=c_"2718.765">__and__</span> visually connects with me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>But I, I still think there's this barrier there. And I'd, I'd love that to break down. I think eventually it will Darwin, but, I think music has <span style="color:red" data-ts="2727.165" data-end_ts="2727.365" title="2727.165" id=c_"2727.165">__got__</span>, as a creative process, music has got that lovely ability to reach out to, to, to masses and draw them in. And I just wish art would, and, you know, I, I do my bit and hopefully other people do their bit and then, you know, kids and whoever have just got this passing interest in art get drawn into it more. And, you know, and that would make me very happy. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now you actually have, the way that you and I first got connected is some plans that you have for sort of like a new series of artwork that's taking place over the course of this and next year, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>Yes. Yeah. Yeah. So, it's, it's my biggest project to date. And it's working with, modular synthesis. So I'm reaching out to a wide variety of modular synthesis because, what I love about the modular scene, it's fantastic. Coming back from Super <span style="color:red" data-ts="2777.325" data-end_ts="2777.565" title="2777.325" id=c_"2777.325">__Booth__</span>, it was electric there, and it feels like something's happening at the moment and has been for the last, you know, sort of six years. But I feel like it's coming to this crescendo at the moment. And I love that you've got a lot of different musicians. Some people are just looking at it from an art perspective. Some people are looking at it from a techno, or a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2798.105" data-end_ts="2798.325" title="2798.105" id=c_"2798.105">__and__</span>, you know, and different musical perspective. But the, the whole thing that galvanizes <span style="color:red" data-ts="2803.725" data-end_ts="2803.885" title="2803.725" id=c_"2803.725">__them__</span> together is this beautiful equipment, you know, and I love what's happening at the moment, and I feel, you know, it'll go down in music history as a really interesting time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>And so what I want to do is I wanna document that in fine arts, I want to create a body of work that is inspired by all these artists that is there for time going forward. My idea is actually not to sell this collection, although I will sell limited editions from it, but the original work won't be sold. It'll be held in a, a collection, that will be shown in public galleries. And along with that is the, if you like, the, the dossier of the artist that I've painted to. So the idea is I reach out to <span style="color:red" data-ts="2853.005" data-end_ts="2853.125" title="2853.005" id=c_"2853.005">__a__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2853.325" data-end_ts="2853.445" title="2853.325" id=c_"2853.325">__a__</span>, you know, an artist that is, is mainly using modular. They create a soundscape piece of music, whatever they want to do, that I paint to. But within that as well, that I document what equipment they've used, what sort of patches they've used, you know, what's their, what their idea was behind the track, and the information about the artist itself. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>So that information sits alongside that piece of artwork. So you'll see a piece of artwork, you'll have a big explanation of how that artworks come to be via this other artist, which is the, the, the musician. And then, as I touched on when we were talking earlier, that eventually I'll want to produce a, a book <span style="color:red" data-ts="2896.525" data-end_ts="2896.765" title="2896.525" id=c_"2896.525">__error__</span> of that, that takes all that information and, and puts it into, you know, a a book of all the artists and all the artwork. So it's, it's a massive project and it keeps, you know, the ideas keep coming and it, it's getting bigger and bigger and bigger. And I'm just sort of starting to roll it out now, but I'm so excited. I'm so excited, a to be working with other musicians directly and for it to be all intertwined with, you know, the modular scene that's happening at the moment. So really, you know, really very excited about it all at the moment. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>When is, when is it that you expect to, first showing based off of this collection? Because you're working on this right now, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>Yeah, I've just started, I mean, I've, my first piece is a collaboration with Todd Barton, . And I, you know, I love, I love his LER work. He's amazing. Yeah. Yeah, you've had him on the show as well, haven't you? Yeah, by the way, I've just gotta say, listening to your podcast <span style="color:red" data-ts="2957.645" data-end_ts="2957.765" title="2957.645" id=c_"2957.645">__d__</span> Darwin for thanks for introducing me, Todd <span style="color:red" data-ts="2960.345" data-end_ts="2960.565" title="2960.345" id=c_"2960.345">__Doc__</span> Stucker, because I did, I, I had, I had not heard any of his work before. And Ariel one is now one of my favorite albums of all time, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2968.905" data-end_ts="2969.125" title="2968.905" id=c_"2968.905">__is__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You know, isn't that a head twist? It's so amazing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2971.665" data-end_ts="2971.885" title="2971.665" id=c_"2971.665">__Wag__</span>. Yeah. Yeah. So thank you. Because, you know, I think, you know, I'd like to think I know music and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2976.525" data-end_ts="2976.685" title="2976.525" id=c_"2976.525">__mu__</span> music genres, but I didn't know of Todd. So, but anyway, that's from one Todd to another, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2982.115" data-end_ts="2982.405" title="2982.115" id=c_"2982.115">__Todd__</span>, Todd Barton, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2984.185" data-end_ts="2984.405" title="2984.185" id=c_"2984.185">__we__</span>, yeah. So I'm collaborating with Todd at the moment, just about to start that piece. So that, that's the first piece. And obviously I'm talking to other artists at the moment to roll that out. I think it's gonna be an 18 months program, because as I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2997.765" data-end_ts="2997.925" title="2997.765" id=c_"2997.765">__sa__</span> I say that, things seem to be progression. Like I'm talking to Mylar meds, Alex, who's on YouTube a lot, he does <span style="color:red" data-ts="3006.205" data-end_ts="3006.325" title="3006.205" id=c_"3006.205">__a__</span>, a lot of YouTube on, on modular type of stuff. And we've been going back and forward, and he's in the UK and he's, I said, oh <span style="color:red" data-ts="3013.125" data-end_ts="3013.365" title="3013.125" id=c_"3013.125">__look__</span>, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3013.805" data-end_ts="3014.005" title="3013.805" id=c_"3013.805">__it__</span> might be a good idea to get together and let's do it live, you know, in the studio, you, you jam out, I paint, let's see where it goes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>And he was like, oh, yeah. And we were talking about that, but distance <span style="color:red" data-ts="3023.345" data-end_ts="3023.565" title="3023.345" id=c_"3023.345">__was__</span> quite heavy. And then just today he said, what if we live? What if we do it livestream? And I was thinking, hang on a sec. So like, I could do this to the guys in the States as well. Anyone want that, wanted to do it as a live performance. 'cause obviously some may be studio based, but some might love the live stuff. The I the idea now is that I get in the studio, we project the, the live, performance stream on the, on the back wall. Then I video me painting with the live streaming, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="3052.565" data-end_ts="3052.765" title="3052.565" id=c_"3052.565">__in__</span>, in the back. So all these things are happening, and I wanna try and document them as well on YouTube. I, again, I wanna open up the process. So I'd like to, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="3061.725" data-end_ts="3061.885" title="3061.725" id=c_"3061.725">__had__</span>, I did try and start doing some YouTube videos <span style="color:red" data-ts="3064.805" data-end_ts="3064.925" title="3064.805" id=c_"3064.805">__a__</span>, a year ago. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>It's a big time investment, but I got the time to put into this project. So I sort of want to, show all the beside behind the scenes, what we're doing, how we're doing it, you know, these live performances, and then build up this body of work, which I think's gonna be 18 months. I've got a public gallery that want to show it. So we're just talking to them at the moment of when that will be. And I think that might be, you know, maybe around about two years away to the, it actually starts touring, public spaces. 'cause I'm talking to quite a few people about that. It'd be lovely to get it out the country as well in, in public galleries. So it's, it's quite a long project. But I think a real worthy project of what's happening within the scene at the moment. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>I mean, I think just to go <span style="color:red" data-ts="3113.645" data-end_ts="3113.805" title="3113.645" id=c_"3113.645">__out__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3113.805" data-end_ts="3113.965" title="3113.805" id=c_"3113.805">__it__</span> hammering tongue for six months doesn't, you know, isn't good enough really. Right. For what's happening. The, the breadth of what's happening at the moment I think is very rich and I don't wanna miss out on any <span style="color:red" data-ts="3125.725" data-end_ts="3125.845" title="3125.725" id=c_"3125.725">__a__</span> anything really, you know? Sure. Right. So, so yeah, I think, you know, it'll be an 18 month project probably at, you know, the end of the two year mark. It'll be ready to sort of go on to, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3136.705" data-end_ts="3136.925" title="3136.705" id=c_"3136.705">__or__</span>, and I, I just want it to mark this moment in time of what's happening within, you know, modular synthesis. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it sounds like an amazing project. I can't wait to, see this develop more. I think it's really smart to try and do a book project because, these kind of collections and this is gonna, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3157.515" data-end_ts="3157.805" title="3157.515" id=c_"3157.515">__it's__</span> gonna be a very unique, collaboration and one where I know a lot of, a lot of the musicians that you're already talking about, they haven't had an opportunity to collaborate in quite this way. So I think this is really gonna be, a, a super, a super opportunity to do something shockingly new. And I, I really applaud you for taking this on. This really seems fabulous. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>Oh, thank you, Darwin. That's, that, that's really kind words. Thank you very much for that. And yeah, I am, I just, I got this instinct <span style="color:red" data-ts="3190.595" data-end_ts="3190.885" title="3190.595" id=c_"3190.595">__that__</span>, you know, it could be something, you know, fantastic. And I'm not just saying in terms of my art, but in term, in the, in the terms of collaboration and working with those modular artists and melding, you know, those creative forms together, which I know can be melded 'cause, you know, I've done it. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3209.745" data-end_ts="3209.965" title="3209.745" id=c_"3209.745">__And__</span>, but to do this in this type of way and to have direct collaboration and, you know, to do it, with, with this type of equipment and sound, I think it's just, you know, I'm just very, very excited about it <span style="color:red" data-ts="3220.925" data-end_ts="3221.125" title="3220.925" id=c_"3220.925">__all__</span>. Yeah. 
</p>

<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So, ed, unfortunately our time is already up. I, I have this I know list of things I sketched out here I wanted to continue to talk about and we're already hit, hit the wall. Yeah. But before we go, I just wanna let, this will be in the show notes on the site, but for people who want to check out your work, where would be the best place for them to check it out online? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>So, yeah, my website is probably the best, which is, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3248.225" data-end_ts="3248.445" title="3248.225" id=c_"3248.225">__www__</span> edward ball.co.uk. Or if you put Edward Ball abstract artists in Google, you know, you, you can find me through there. And what I'm hoping to do, I mean, I've got a fair bit of information upon on the site, but by the time this airs I'll try and, you know, get a bit more information up there for what we've been talking about too. And, also the, the way people may be able to get involved as well, specifically in the modular community. I'd like to talk to people, see what they would like to hear and see, again, I'm, I'm this, I'm this person that likes to think of getting people involved with <span style="color:red" data-ts="3285.945" data-end_ts="3286.165" title="3285.945" id=c_"3285.945">__the__</span>, with this, and I'd like to get the actual whole community involved. So if I, if I can do that somehow, I'm trying to work out how we can do that. But if I can do that somehow and then document that, that, I mean, that'd be fantastic. So yeah, if you, if you go to my website, hopefully, there'll, there'll be a fair bit of information on there for, for, for the, for people to have a look at.

<b>Darwin: </b>Fantastic. Well Ed, I want to thank you so much for taking the time outta your schedule and have this chat. I already can't wait until the next time we talk, but in the meantime, thank you and have a great day.

<p>
<b>Ed: </b>Yeah. And you Darwin, thanks a lot for having me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright.

<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Many thanks to Ed for having the chat. It was really interesting to hear about. It's really interesting mix of fine art and music. If you have a chance, check out his site. He gave the address there a second ago. It'll also be in the show notes if you want to check those out. Thanks so much for listening and I am buzzing away on vacation, so I'm gonna be <span style="color:red" data-ts="3349.765" data-end_ts="3349.925" title="3349.765" id=c_"3349.765">__kinda__</span> a little fritting about.
