<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today I am very excited to speak to somebody. I actually have gotten pinged from a number of you all, you all being my listeners, about talking to this particular person. His name's Brian Clevinger and he is, noted as well as being notorious as the developer of the Absence <span style="color:red" data-ts="32.435" data-end_ts="32.725" title="32.435" id=c_"32.435">__Soft__</span> System. I don't know about you, but for me it's a integral part of my working environment, my musical working environment. It's an amazing piece of piece of software. And so I'm really excited to have Brian, Brian on board for, this interview. So with that, I'll shut up and we'll start talking to Brian. Hey Brian. How are you today? Pretty 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian Clevinger: </b>Good. Good to be here. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thank you so much for joining us. You're located in France, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Yeah, that's right. Originally I'm from Kansas, but I've lived in France since 1989. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh my goodness. So what, what is it that, what is it that got you to move to France? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>My wife is French. Ah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>So, we were living in a small town in Kansas, in Lawrence, Kansas. Yeah. Which was a nice place, but, I don't know, it was just an adventure. Sure. We decided to move to Paris. I was interested in Aircom and all the electronic music stuff that was happening in France. So it was just an adventure and we ended up settling here, so, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Very interesting. So, I kind of spilled the beans a little bit that, that you are the developer of absence, but why don't we have you describe what your current work is with the kinds of things that you're doing right now? Current 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Work, I'm, I'm mostly doing kind of r and d exploratory type of work for future products. Okay. Possibly future absence, maybe something else. Lately I've been playing a lot with modal synthesis. I'm real interested in that. I don't know how much I should talk about <laugh>, specifically what I'm, I'm doing because, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, that's, well, just, I, I guess I'm mostly interested in just hearing that you're kind of on an r and d track. 'cause that's pretty exciting. Right. Those of us who are absent fans, and I think that there are an extraordinary number of <span style="color:red" data-ts="147.105" data-end_ts="147.525" title="147.105" id=c_"147.105">__absent__</span> fans out there are all gonna be really excited to hear that you remain active in r and d because Yes, I think a lot of us really trust your vision for, synthesis. It's, it's really, it's really cool. Now, I'm curious, one of the things I like doing in my podcast is talking to people about their background. And I'm curious, what is the track that you took that got you to the point of making <span style="color:red" data-ts="171.705" data-end_ts="172.125" title="171.705" id=c_"171.705">__absent__</span>? It's a, it's an amazing piece of work. I'm wondering what your track was to get there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Let's see. Well, basically, I have a composition degree. I, I'm a more of a musician than, than a programmer by, my education and my background. But, in the mid nineties, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="194.385" data-end_ts="194.605" title="194.385" id=c_"194.385">__and__</span> computers started getting fast enough to do real <span style="color:red" data-ts="197.885" data-end_ts="198.085" title="197.885" id=c_"197.885">__time__</span> audio. There wasn't a lot available. There was Super Collider I remember that I worked a lot with at the time. And one day I was, I was thinking about, you know, like the early history of Apple when you had this potential for home computers that people didn't realize was a possibility yet except for like hobbyists, you know, right. Geeky people who just wanted to have a computer, just to have a computer. Sure. Jobs and Wozniak had this, this vision, they realized, you know, there was this, this potential. And I was, anyway, I was thinking about that, thinking about how, you know, what a rare opportunity that was. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>And I realized, well, look, now we can do real <span style="color:red" data-ts="243.245" data-end_ts="243.405" title="243.245" id=c_"243.245">__time__</span> audio on computers. We can do real <span style="color:red" data-ts="246.245" data-end_ts="246.405" title="246.245" id=c_"246.245">__time__</span> synthesis, but what we have is this, you know, hard to use, not terribly practical, kind of academic types of programs, experi and very interesting stuff too. But that's gonna appeal to a limited number of musicians. Right. And so I realized, you know, this is, this is the time, this is the time for me. I, I think I'd always wanted to design a synthesizer. And, I didn't have the engineering background and stuff, but I'd worked enough with computers, synthesis. I've worked a lot with <span style="color:red" data-ts="281.385" data-end_ts="281.605" title="281.385" id=c_"281.385">__Max__</span>. I, I thought I could become a programmer. And so I thought, well, now's the time to try this, you know, see what I can do with it. And so I taught myself programming, taught myself c and c plus plus. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>And, it took about three years for me to go from, you know, nothing to having, the first version of absence, which I think was in 2000. And I originally released it as a shareware, and it was just a big hit. It happened at just the right time. I think there were, there were a few different products out, but they weren't, either they were limited or they were not terribly practical. <span style="color:red" data-ts="321.165" data-end_ts="321.405" title="321.165" id=c_"321.165">__Right__</span>. It, it was kind of a weird period. I, I don't know if you remember what it was like then. VSTI, VSD instruments wasn't really happening yet. There were a lot of standalone synthesis applications, which <span style="color:red" data-ts="334.305" data-end_ts="334.725" title="334.305" id=c_"334.305">__absent__</span> was too. Yeah. Originally it wasn't a plugin, and there was this transition, you know, from these standalone software syn to, plugins that some of the products didn't make it. And that was something we all went through. I mean, I think, max MSP and reactor and absence, all, all, all of these, these products started off as, standalone. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Absolutely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Anyway, it <span style="color:red" data-ts="359.365" data-end_ts="359.485" title="359.365" id=c_"359.365">__was__</span>, it was a time when I think people were just starting to understand that you could use the computer as a synthesizer, use it as an instrument, but people hadn't really seen very convincing products. I think, with the exception of like a reactor and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_(software)">Max/MSP</a>I think. But again, those, those are difficult programs to approach. Sure. You know, it, <span style="color:red" data-ts="384.225" data-end_ts="384.445" title="384.225" id=c_"384.225">__it__</span>, you have to know a lot. And I wanted to do something that was real flexible and real open, but more direct than the, totally modular approach. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>You know, where you're not working with, you know, real low level kinds of objects like multiplies and ads and stuff like that, <laugh>, you know? Right. You're just, you're just working with higher level types of objects with a lot of modulation possibilities. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, it's, it's interesting that you say it that way because I think, you know, as someone who's spent some time underneath the preset skin of absence, what you have there is, you have all the hallmarks of a sophisticated modular system. You've just kind of packaged it in a way that presents itself more like an instrument and less like a programming language. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Yes, exactly. It's not a programming language, obviously, but it's, much more flexible than a, you know, traditional 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Mini, mini <span style="color:red" data-ts="447.505" data-end_ts="447.725" title="447.505" id=c_"447.505">__mo__</span> emulation. Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Exactly. You could say it's sort of in between <span style="color:red" data-ts="451.405" data-end_ts="451.525" title="451.405" id=c_"451.405">__a__</span> MiniMogue and, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Reactor 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, I, that's a very interesting history, first of all, that there are very few people for whom their first effort at making a product ends up taking them through their whole career. You know, <laugh>, and that's kind of where you're at. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>It, it, yeah. I kind of won the lottery 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="476.425" data-end_ts="476.645" title="476.425" id=c_"476.425">__In__</span>, in a way. Yeah. <laugh>. Well, and the timing was right. Certainly 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>That, I think that was it. I think if it had happened if few years later, you know, the market would've been pretty saturated. Right. It wouldn't have gotten the attention it did. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's certainly true. So, I have a couple of questions though, related to that along the way. In order to make, in order to be where you're at today, you had to make a lot of r not only have your timing be right, but you have to have made a lot of right decisions along the way. Right, right. So one, you know, one really important decision was to team up with Native instruments, which was clearly, you know, a really big winner in terms of bringing it to a higher level market, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>That's, that's right. That's, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And another, another thing you had to decide was to embrace it being a plugin device as opposed to just a standalone device. And then also what sort of like plugins to, to support, because you know, if we think back, for those of us who were there, if we think back to 2000, nobody knew who was gonna be the winner was. Right. Was MOTU gonna win with MAS? Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>That's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. There was, was Steinberg gonna win with, with vsts was, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Think we had, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>We had a mass version of absence, I think. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Did you, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>I think <laugh>, I can't even remember, but there <span style="color:red" data-ts="572.365" data-end_ts="572.405" title="572.365" id=c_"572.365">__were__</span> all these plugin formats. Yeah. It was crazy. Don't exist 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now. Right. And if you would've put all your effort into one, or even worse, if you would have, you know, 'cause I saw this where companies said, you know what? We're gonna work really closely with, I dunno, we're gonna work really closely with, with the Pro Tools thing, and we're going to show up at all their events and we're gonna align ourselves very much with them. And then they're like, oh yeah, you know what? We don't really like this format. We're gonna go with another format. And they were left behind. And so otherwise great technology was disappeared because it attached itself kind of to the wrong technology or the wrong partners. Right. And you actually really did a great job of making decisions. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Well, that's okay. In terms of plugin compatibility. That's, that's in i's side Uhhuh <affirmative>, and I'm not too terribly involved in that. So at this point, I, in the past I used to have to deal more directly with plugin stuff, but today, today I don't, I don't, I don't think about it. I I don't do any, you know, I do very little plugin specific development now. Sure, sure. But, those, those were in nice decisions and they, they did a really great job. I, I think, because it's, it's a very difficult programming task. You know, you, you, you have to support both Mac and Windows. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and you have to do it in a way that performs well too. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Yeah. You have to do it in a way that performs well. You have to be able to support, at the time you had to support Intel and also, Motorola Power pc. Right, right. Processors. Okay. So you had these totally different kinds of processing environments and of course, different operating systems, and each operating system had three or four plugin formats to support. Right, right. Which is a, a programming nightmare. It <span style="color:red" data-ts="683.885" data-end_ts="683.965" title="683.885" id=c_"683.885">__is__</span>. You know, I mean, most, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's that evil matrix thing, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Yeah. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="688.065" data-end_ts="688.485" title="688.065" id=c_"688.065">__Absent__</span> originally was on Mac and it was a standalone. So there was a kind of painful transition from that to doing something that could be portable, you know? Right. That, that was a very, very busy time in my life. <laugh> <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So when was it that you joined forces with Ni 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>I joined forces with NI in, it was officially announced at <span style="color:red" data-ts="710.925" data-end_ts="711.205" title="710.925" id=c_"710.925">__Music__</span> Mesa in 2001. <span style="color:red" data-ts="713.665" data-end_ts="713.885" title="713.665" id=c_"713.665">__Oh__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>I think, that happened quite fast, actually. There, after I released the, the shareware version, there were, there were a few people that were contacting me. I mean, a few different companies, I want to say who, but, <span style="color:red" data-ts="729.505" data-end_ts="729.725" title="729.505" id=c_"729.505">__and__</span> I actually, a couple of guys, Mata Gallup. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, Bert Juergens came to Paris and met me, and they were just really cool. Yeah. They were very open-minded. I, I felt that they trusted me as a, a developer that, that they, they liked my ideas. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I felt that they would let me do more or less what I want, and that they would contribute, you know, good ideas on their side. So that was the <span style="color:red" data-ts="757.085" data-end_ts="757.285" title="757.085" id=c_"757.085">__reason__</span>, really what made me comfortable working with <span style="color:red" data-ts="759.765" data-end_ts="759.885" title="759.765" id=c_"759.765">__I__</span> Sure. I felt that they weren't gonna try to change, change it into a different kind of product or Right. Simplify it or dumb it down. And I've been real happy with the relationship with <span style="color:red" data-ts="772.465" data-end_ts="772.685" title="772.465" id=c_"772.465">__NI__</span> over the years. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. And rightfully so. I mean, they have always kind of kept absent as sort of like a flagship synthesis product, which is great. 'cause again, we're talking about now 15 years Yeah. Since you, since you started working with them. I mean, it's great for them to have that kind of a history that, that they're willing to, to stick with something for that long. Because there, again, if with computer products, sometimes they have a tendency to come and go too quickly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. And so that's, that's really neat. Well, when you, when you first started working with them, did they already have like this plugin framework, in existence? Or was that something that you were developing with them at 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>The time? <span style="color:red" data-ts="816.085" data-end_ts="816.165" title="816.085" id=c_"816.085">__That__</span>, that's something that kind of happened a little later. I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>See. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>So in the early years, I actually was, it didn't have quite as much plugin support. It was more like just VST. And, I remember the Windows port being kind of an ordeal. Right. Being a Mac guy. Yeah. But, yeah, <span style="color:red" data-ts="834.445" data-end_ts="834.565" title="834.445" id=c_"834.445">__I__</span> had <span style="color:red" data-ts="834.605" data-end_ts="834.765" title="834.605" id=c_"834.605">__to__</span> actually, at the time I was, I had more responsibility with plugin stuff. I see. But by absence two, absent two and <span style="color:red" data-ts="842.205" data-end_ts="842.605" title="842.205" id=c_"842.205">__absent__</span> three, it was really more on, on their side. And we had more plugin support by, by that time. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What I'm curious about is what led to you, you know, so, so you learned programming and you started, working on and eventually developing <span style="color:red" data-ts="861.565" data-end_ts="862.045" title="861.565" id=c_"861.565">__absence__</span>, but you had to have something as a precursor to that. You said you have a composition degree, and that you're more <span style="color:red" data-ts="869.325" data-end_ts="869.445" title="869.325" id=c_"869.325">__a__</span> musician than programmer. What is, where did you get your degree and how did you move from there to saying, I have to be a programmer? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Okay. So that's going way, way back. Right. The first, I, I, I'm a bass player. I'm an electric bass player. That's the only instrument I feel comfortable saying I'm pretty good at. I studied jazz for a while, and I was interested in Avantgarde music too. I mean, I, I, I have real diverse musical tastes. And, I was interested in studying composition. So I was, I'm from Kansas, so I went to the University of Kansas. And, they had a nice electronic music studio based around an arp. 2,500 mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and a 2,600. And there was also an a KS in the studio we got to play with sometimes. So as far as that, that was <span style="color:red" data-ts="923.845" data-end_ts="924.005" title="923.845" id=c_"923.845">__to__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="924.005" data-end_ts="924.085" title="924.005" id=c_"924.005">__be__</span> my first real experience with electronic music was working with the, 2,500 especially. I enjoyed it. I felt like I was good at it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>But at the same time, this is weird to say, because that's a kind of mythic sort of instrument today, you know, like an Arc 2,500. Wow. I know. But at the time, we were like, you know, this is seventies stuff. This was in the eighties. Eighties. Right. We were like, I, I was in, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="951.165" data-end_ts="951.365" title="951.165" id=c_"951.165">__wanted__</span> digital. Yeah. You know, I was interested in digital stuff. I remember our composition teacher, he played me Paul Lansky's six fantasies. That was the first computer music I'd ever heard. And it was like something out of a dream <laugh>, you know, it didn't sound like anything I'd imagined before. And I was like, well, that's what I want to do. And where could you do that? There were, I, you know, I couldn't do it where I was, I was reading Computer Music Journal and it would have these little floppy records. Right. What do you call those? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. The sound sheets. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Right. Sound sheets. And there'd be like, these sounds from like, ear <span style="color:red" data-ts="989.315" data-end_ts="989.605" title="989.315" id=c_"989.315">__calm__</span>, these sounds, that was like, wow, what is that? You know? I know, right. Just, just really intriguing, but also inaccessible. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. You know. Well, and especially, especially being in the heartland, I mean, you were lucky in that you were in Lawrence, but even still Yeah. It's the middle of the country. There's stuff happening on the East coast. There's stuff happening on the West Coast, and there's stuff happening in Europe, but not a whole lot of stuff really germinating out of the center of the US 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>No, no. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I found myself in a similar place at a similar time. So, mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>I guess I kind of, grew up in isolation from <span style="color:red" data-ts="1025.505" data-end_ts="1025.725" title="1025.505" id=c_"1025.505">__the__</span>, the real creative sins in, in electronic music. Then I started working with the Yamaha stuff, and then by that point, I was getting sounds, I liked, I was able to work compositionally in a way that I liked. And I, I really liked working with the FM systems with the, at home. I had a, they had this little computer, the CX five M. Right, right. If you remember that. I had one of those. Cool. And I spent so much time on that thing. I had that and, TX eight 16. Right. No, TX 81 Z. What am I saying? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Very different <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Yeah. Yeah. But I did, I did work with the TX eight 16 as well. Okay. But it wasn't, wasn't mine. So anyway, I worked a lot with the Yamaha stuff, and I, I feel like that influenced me. I think the breakpoint envelopes, I, I was kind of thinking like DX seven or, the SY 77. There, there was an idea I liked a lot in those synths, but it was real limited. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, and, and hard to visualize when you just had a bunch of novels. Exactly. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>You know, and that's one of the things I saw as being a big advantage of computers, is you had this nice interface to work with. Right. This nice visual interface. So you could do a lot of more visual oriented things that were always very awkward with hardware <span style="color:red" data-ts="1104.525" data-end_ts="1104.805" title="1104.525" id=c_"1104.525">__sense__</span>, like, drawing waveforms, for example. Absolutely. You know? Right. That's, that was an idea that it just intrigued me, you know, before I had access to any kind of digital system, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1115.465" data-end_ts="1115.885" title="1115.465" id=c_"1115.465">__seemed__</span> like a fair light when you could draw a waveform Right. With a pin on the screen. That just seemed like the coolest thing, you know, and there was some hardware <span style="color:red" data-ts="1124.495" data-end_ts="1124.845" title="1124.495" id=c_"1124.495">__sense__</span> that tried to allow that, and it wasn't very practical. Right. And so those are the kinds of things that, I saw with the computers as being a big advantage. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's interesting too, because <span style="color:red" data-ts="1137.265" data-end_ts="1137.485" title="1137.265" id=c_"1137.265">__the__</span> systems that you found yourself really familiar with, actually, it, it's easy in that context to see where you got some of the focus for absence. Because, you know, first of all, an <span style="color:red" data-ts="1152.925" data-end_ts="1153.005" title="1152.925" id=c_"1152.925">__RP__</span> 2,500 is very unique because instead of just being patch cord modulation routings, it had this whole kinda like slider switch, modulation matrix Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, which made it sort of a semi patched modular. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Right, right. Right. There's a limited number of sliders. Right. And stuff. I mean, yeah. In a way it's more limited than patch cords, but, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But at the same time, it again, it, it sort of implies direction. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And, and similarly, it's interesting to hear that the TX 81 <span style="color:red" data-ts="1190.365" data-end_ts="1190.485" title="1190.365" id=c_"1190.365">__C__</span> is something you had, because I always found that of all of that earlier yaha stuff, I found that the most intriguing because first of all, it had waveforms other than sign <span style="color:red" data-ts="1202.005" data-end_ts="1202.205" title="1202.005" id=c_"1202.005">__wave__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Right, right. I use that all the time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. But also the routing, it had a little bit more flexibility in the routing and the algorithm use as I recall. Or like, maybe it was like the boundaries of the modulations or whatever, but I found it to be incredibly interesting to program. Now, I never got good enough that I actually got the sounds that I liked <laugh>, unlike 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>You, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Because it was really easy. It was really easy to go from a very pure bell sound to the, the cat scratching the screen door. Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But, and I have to say, I kind of enjoyed that experimentation, even if I didn't get really musical results. Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b><affirmative>. Well, o one thing I always found with the f instance, the way I viewed them is, of course, they didn't have any kinda resonant characteristics. They didn't have any filters. They didn't have built-in effects or anything like that. And I would almost systematically play it through something else, through some kind of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1264.805" data-end_ts="1265.085" title="1264.805" id=c_"1264.805">__effect__</span> processor. And I found that if I was playing it through some kind of dance reverb or something, I would create a, a totally different kind of sound than if I had been just listening directly to the output of the sense. And I would make <span style="color:red" data-ts="1280.525" data-end_ts="1280.645" title="1280.525" id=c_"1280.525">__a__</span> sound that worked with that reverb. See what I mean, that's actually, I, in a way, I thought of the FM part as being like the string of a guitar, but without any kind of resonating 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Body body. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>It did, it didn't have the resonator, and that was what was missing. And so it would have to try different things, you know, to try to, add that body to it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So for you, the effects processor ended up as much of the sound design as the, as the synthesis. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Yeah. Yeah. Now, I, I was working a lot with the f mim. I mean, I was, I, it wasn't like I just slapped a effect on <span style="color:red" data-ts="1318.805" data-end_ts="1318.885" title="1318.805" id=c_"1318.805">__it__</span>. Right. It sounded good <laugh>. It was. But, to, to me, the, the effect was an integral part of, of the sound as a resonator. Right. You know, I still kind of think in sounds in terms of like, a source, something that generates the sound. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> then <span style="color:red" data-ts="1335.565" data-end_ts="1335.685" title="1335.565" id=c_"1335.565">__a__</span> or some kind of resonator. And then the space that the, the, the instruments in, I tend to think of sounds in those three ha having these three parts. So yeah, the, the, the FM synth really was just the first part. It was the sound generator, then it needed a resonator and then something to create a space. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and again, it points to what you ended up with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1359.545" data-end_ts="1359.965" title="1359.545" id=c_"1359.545">__absent__</span>. 'cause I think one of the things that, you know, now, certainly I feel strongly when, when I'm working with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1365.265" data-end_ts="1365.685" title="1365.265" id=c_"1365.265">__Absent__</span>, is that the sound programming really includes effects processing as an integral part of the sound design. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Yes. And I don't really even think of it as effects so much. Right. I think of it, it's, it's just part of the instrument. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Almost, almost like alternative filters or something. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Exactly. Right. Now it's interesting. I mean, I mean, delays can, can cross this boundary between, between pitch and time, you know? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, if the delay's long enough, it's an echo, but as it gets shorter and shorter, it starts functioning as a filter or even as an oscillator. Right. And that's an interesting property of delays that I, I, I was always kind of fascinated with that, but I wanted the modulation of the effect to be part of the whole modulation system, you know, with the envelopes and stuff. Right. Instead of it being just its own little separate thing. And I, I didn't want to have effects that were real specific, like a flare or a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1423.645" data-end_ts="1423.965" title="1423.645" id=c_"1423.645">__chorus__</span> or 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Something. Right. Something too prescriptive. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Yeah. I wanna just provide, these are all delays, so I'll have these different configurations of delays to have different properties. And you, you set it up to get the kind of sound you're interested in. That's, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Yeah. Yeah. I al I always saw it as, as being a real integral part of the patch and not just something to make it prettier or 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Shine, put a shine on it. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1447.545" data-end_ts="1447.765" title="1447.545" id=c_"1447.545">__Now__</span>, there were, for a long time there was kind of this shtick with hardware synths where the presets that you would get from with your synth, and I'm sitting here looking at my old Kurzwell, and Kurzwell was notorious for this, which is, in order to make it so that the presets would sound great at the music store, they would dredge everything in reverb, even though it didn't actually make it musically better. It just happened to be, that sounded better in the music store. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Right, exactly. I, I understand why they would do that <laugh>, but, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1482.945" data-end_ts="1483.165" title="1482.945" id=c_"1482.945">__But__</span> that doesn't make you wanna do it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Right. And, you know, with the hardware synth, it's, yeah. It's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1487.005" data-end_ts="1487.165" title="1487.005" id=c_"1487.005">__different__</span>. You know, there's more of an effort, you know, to add reverb to it. You need to have a separate reverb unit. Maybe you want <span style="color:red" data-ts="1494.165" data-end_ts="1494.205" title="1494.165" id=c_"1494.165">__to__</span> use that reverb for something else. Yeah. So I guess it, you know, it makes sense. But for me, reverb, I'm thinking because I, I don't have an integrated reverb in absence, really. I mean, I have some things that can get reverb <span style="color:red" data-ts="1507.195" data-end_ts="1507.485" title="1507.195" id=c_"1507.195">__like__</span> effects, but for proper reverb, I was thinking, you know, people are using this as a plugin. People have reverb already. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b><laugh>, they've probably got their own favorite reverb. So Yeah, exactly. That's, it's not really something I need, need to integrate. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. You need to put your fingerprint 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>On. Right. Rather focus on other things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. So one of the things that I'm curious about in your case is this idea that you felt like you were more musician than programmer. I'm curious to what extent that was a little nerve wracking. So like when you were first, when you took and you developed the first version of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1545.625" data-end_ts="1546.045" title="1545.625" id=c_"1545.625">__Absent__</span>, and you threw it out there as shareware, and then also when you went and talked to Native Instruments and you were, you know, were presenting them with a body of code or whatever. Did you ever feel like, well, you know, I just kinda learned this on my own <laugh> and I hope it's not embarrassing. Totally. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Or Yeah. Oh yeah. <laugh>. Yeah. I, I mean, I think I'm an okay programmer now. Uhhuh, you know, I mean, I've learned over the years, but yeah, I'm, I was intimidated <laugh> in the beginning because, you know, obviously I hadn't studied it in school or anything. Right. I felt kinda like, you, you imagine being the guitarist in some band that becomes successful. And then you meet guitarists who are like session musicians Yeah. <laugh>, you know, who are like <span style="color:red" data-ts="1589.165" data-end_ts="1589.565" title="1589.165" id=c_"1589.165">__better__</span> than you. And you're like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1591.595" data-end_ts="1591.885" title="1591.595" id=c_"1591.595">__well__</span>, <laugh>, oh man. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. I just <span style="color:red" data-ts="1594.605" data-end_ts="1594.725" title="1594.605" id=c_"1594.605">__could__</span> go hide for a while. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b><laugh>. Yeah. Yeah, there was some of that, but <span style="color:red" data-ts="1598.725" data-end_ts="1598.845" title="1598.725" id=c_"1598.725">__the__</span>, but they were really cool about it too. I mean, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. The, the thing I I'm curious about is the, the fact is in order to make <span style="color:red" data-ts="1606.785" data-end_ts="1607.205" title="1606.785" id=c_"1606.785">__absent__</span> work, I mean, certainly there's a lot of graphic design involved there and proper development of, and, and performant creation of user interfaces is one set of things. But the tools necessary to do DSP programming, especially musical DSP programming, that's still not something that they really actively teach in most universities anyway. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>No. And what they teach isn't really, doesn't really apply so much to sense. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But then also, yeah, it mostly applies to cell phones. Right, right. But also, in 2000, there wasn't even enough of an, of an internet backbone for you to necessarily find a lot of information there. So I'm curious about where did you go to find the stuff that says, here's how to do a digital oscillator. Here's how to do an anti alias oscillator. Here's how to do a decent sounding filter. Here's how to make it so that your modulation doesn't choke your CPU or whatever. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Well, there, there actually was quite a bit of stuff available on the internet, but it was harder to find at the time. But I found it <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You were Alta Vista's best user. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Exactly. I forgot all about Alta <span style="color:red" data-ts="1682.165" data-end_ts="1682.205" title="1682.165" id=c_"1682.165">__Vista__</span> <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I haven't gotten <span style="color:red" data-ts="1683.965" data-end_ts="1684.085" title="1683.965" id=c_"1683.965">__use__</span>, I haven't gotten to use that in five years. So I was happy to pull that one out of that 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b><laugh>, actually, the original absence, the very first version did not have anti liaising. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>It was more like a DX seven in that sense. Right, right. And that was because all the Ds, all the anti liaising strategies I found were just, just sounded horrible. Yeah. They sounded worse than the liaising to me. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>I mean, some of the products that came out at the time, you know, it was, it was like, you imagine like key groups. I mean, the OSS worked like key groups on a sampler, Uhhuh, <affirmative>, but it, but the, the top end would be chopped off. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>You know, so that you would have between, I don't know, 15 K and 20 K chopped off. Right. And that creates the sound that I can't stand. Yeah. It's, it's like having an insect inside my ear or something. <laugh>, I, I can't stand <span style="color:red" data-ts="1741.475" data-end_ts="1741.765" title="1741.475" id=c_"1741.475">__this__</span> sound. So I was like, well, the aliasing sounds better than that. <laugh>. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's funny that you say that because that, that's something I tend to think of it the way it doesn't sound like insects to me. What it sounds like to me is plastic, you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Know? Yeah. It, yeah. That's Uhhuh <affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And I remember the first time I heard it and was horrified by, it was Steinberg put out some kind of, I don't even remember what the name of it was called, maybe it was like Model E or something, but it was supposed to be a minimoog <span style="color:red" data-ts="1771.125" data-end_ts="1771.365" title="1771.125" id=c_"1771.125">__like__</span> thing. Right. And they were kind of like bragging about how they had, you know, done a lot of work to make these rich and and fat sounding oscillators. And I excitedly ran down to the store and plop my money on the table and took it home and plugged it in. And it felt like it was wrapped in Saran wrap <laugh>. It was just like, it was like, oh my God, this is the most disappointing thing in the history of ever. And so I, I remember being really disappointed by that. And, and I agree there was, if you enjoyed embracing the buzzy and kind of aggressive sound of alias oscillators Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, there was actually a lot of, a lot of good stuff. And I mean, now, now people like actively are looking for DX one hundreds or whatever specifically to be able to embrace that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Right. Well, you can still turn the anti-aliasing off in absence Uhhuh <affirmative>, which I use when I'm making like noise sounds. Sure. Of course. You know, like modulating, modulating a real, real bright wave form with no anti-aliasing produce really interesting noise, noise source that way. Sure. And you know, it's funny 'cause the really old absence sounds, if you turn the ing off, they don't sound the same. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, really? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>So, that's, that, that was actually the reason we left it in <laugh> as a possibility was because the old sounds didn't sound quite right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's hilarious. Well, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1860.665" data-end_ts="1860.885" title="1860.665" id=c_"1860.665">__and__</span>, but that does bring, bring up a point absence currently at version number five. How much of a weight is the history of patches and songs that people have created in absence that actually kind of hamstrings you from making big changes? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Huh. That's an interesting question. And that's kind of a question I think a lot about actually. Yeah. I mean there, there are things I would really like to change internally and I think I can, and that would bring some big improvements. And I think I can do it by maintaining a pretty good compatibility with the past. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, at some point we'll have to say, this is, you know, the sounds are gonna work. Maybe it won't be quite exactly the same. Right. At some point I think we'll have to make that decision. Yeah. I, I, I don't know. I mean, it becomes a, a, a bit of a chore having to maintain compatibility modes and legacy modes and stuff, but, it's not that big of a problem either. And, and I do want people to be able to preserve their sounds. I wanna keep my sounds right. You know, I don't wanna lose all the sounds I've made. Sure. I mean, originally I made absence because I wanted the, a sense that I wanted to use <laugh>. So I, I don't want to <laugh>, I don't wanna lose my work. Right. I don't want it to start sounding wrong. Yeah, that's, that's an interesting thing to consider. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So as a, as a musician yourself, you obviously, clearly you use <span style="color:red" data-ts="1951.155" data-end_ts="1951.645" title="1951.155" id=c_"1951.155">__absence__</span> for your own work. What are some other things that, well, first of all, do you have any music of your own that's out there that people would be able to listen, listen to? I'm sure people would be fascinated to hear what you've been doing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Basically all that's, that's out there is, I mean, I'm not a successful musician <laugh>, unfortunately. I, I, I mean there's my SoundCloud, there's some stuff on SoundCloud. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So give us <span style="color:red" data-ts="1975.905" data-end_ts="1976.125" title="1975.905" id=c_"1975.905">__the__</span> site right away so that we can, we can get it there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>It's, it's just Brian Clevinger on SoundCloud. It's mostly just kind of absence demos. Okay. I guess <laugh>. Alright. I mean it, I it's mostly these soundscapes I make with absence. Got it. But it's, it's quite listenable I think. Sure. I mean, it's not just individual sounds. It's these, these sounds that are these big evolving soundscapes and I just put a chunk of it. Got it. You know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So do you do a lot of the preset development or do you have other people helping you with that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>No, and I, and I manages that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see, okay. I, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>I'll propose presets, but it's just like everybody else, it's like all the other sound designers. Right. You know, I'll, I'll propose I'll give 'em 20 presets and they'll use three of them or something. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Has their preset developers ever surprised you by giving you something you didn't know was possible? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Simon's stockhouse sounds always really impressed me. Sure. I mean, there's a lot <span style="color:red" data-ts="2040.075" data-end_ts="2040.365" title="2040.075" id=c_"2040.075">__that__</span>, there are a number of times. I mean, especially with Simon's stuff, or play the key and the sound comes out, I'm like, wow, <laugh>, how do you do that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The other thing I was gonna ask is, is besides <span style="color:red" data-ts="2052.675" data-end_ts="2053.165" title="2052.675" id=c_"2052.675">__absence__</span>, what are the things out there that you kinda love? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>The things I love, you mean like syns? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Like Yeah. Syns and stuff, or, or effects or new hardware maybe, I don't know. What is, when you play music as opposed to programming, music devices, what are things you like using? What are the things that kind of 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Ate you <span style="color:red" data-ts="2071.605" data-end_ts="2071.725" title="2071.605" id=c_"2071.605">__Well__</span>, I like using, well, I'm a bass player, Uhhuh, so, you know, there's base gear, <laugh>, <laugh> as far as seriously, as far as sense and stuff go, I just use absence. Okay. And I use, contact when I need a sampler. Got 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>It's, it's kind of a discipline thing. I, I, I always like to, even before absence, I, I preferred to have kind of a limited range of synth to work with. Yeah. And I felt like Yamaha <span style="color:red" data-ts="2101.885" data-end_ts="2102.125" title="2101.885" id=c_"2101.885">__sense__</span> I could do a lot with it. Right. Rather <span style="color:red" data-ts="2104.485" data-end_ts="2104.725" title="2104.485" id=c_"2104.485">__than__</span>, rather than having a whole lot of gear that you don't know that well 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Like this synth gets a certain kind of sound just, you know, it's got a certain preset and you like it 'cause of that. Right. I prefer to have maybe one instrument that I know really, really well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's interesting you bring that up though, because that's kinda like one of my shtick, which is that it takes a long time to get facility. I mean, if we think about software as being really instruments rather than just a disposable preset machine. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know, whether you're talking about hardware or software, it actually takes a long time, even if you're good with the interface, if you're good with a keyboard or you're good with a set of pads, or you're good with a bass or a guitar or whatever, when you get a new instrument, a new, a new implementation of an instrument, it takes a long time to get facility on it. But stuff is coming out so fast that it seems like it's actually can be a little bit difficult to have enough time to be getting good at it. Right, right. Right. And maybe this is one of the reasons why I feel so strongly that absent and its long history is so valuable, is that it represents something that's been around long enough that it has a deep body of work and a deep, great number of adherence and a lot of people who've become, who've gotten a lot of facility with it as an instrument. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Right. That's a good point. That's a really good point. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And, and so I'm always curious then when people have kind of this history of, of like developing or using something for a long period of time, what are some of the other things they, they use? Because that to me kind of points to other things that might have that kind of history available to you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Oh, sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I mean, certainly your, your discussion of the FM stuff that is really pointed because FM programming kind of is hard making a mental image of what a FM patch is actually doing. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2228.945" data-end_ts="2229.165" title="2228.945" id=c_"2228.945">__Mm__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative> it's kind of tough. Yeah. And it's something that very few people are able to grind their way through. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Yeah. I think that was more of a problem of the interfaces. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Maybe actually, like I said, I, my first syn I had at home was this, CX five computer. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Okay. So it had actually pretty nice FM editor. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2252.295" data-end_ts="2252.645" title="2252.295" id=c_"2252.295">__Right__</span>. It had had a nice program for, for making sounds that was way better than the DX seven. Sure. Sure. So I feel like that's one reason I got pretty good at it. 'cause we had a decent interface instead of having to, you know, go through bunch of little pages. Right, right. To access each parameter. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I hadn't thought about that as being the real value of the CX five, but of course, that makes a lot of sense. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2277.085" data-end_ts="2277.205" title="2277.085" id=c_"2277.085">__I__</span>, I think it was good to learn on at least. I mean, I mean there, there's a lot of interesting products around, of course, one manufacturer I watch kind of closely is mutable instruments. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. I mean, I don't, I don't own any modular hardware, but I think what he's doing is really, really interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I was going to ask you to ask you if you were getting at all intrigued by the modular stuff, because with your background, you and I, again, kind of had, have this, experience of being surrounded by analog gear at a time when the digital gear was desirable. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2312.285" data-end_ts="2312.565" title="2312.285" id=c_"2312.285">__Right__</span>. I happened to be gone to North Texas when they were so anxious to sort of like remainder all of their own analog stuff because hey, sin <span style="color:red" data-ts="2323.365" data-end_ts="2323.925" title="2323.365" id=c_"2323.365">__claviers__</span> and Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know, they had a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2326.405" data-end_ts="2326.925" title="2326.405" id=c_"2326.405">__<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data">PD</a>P__</span> 11 sitting in the basement that they were using for, they were hand wiring cards for it. It was ridiculous <laugh>. But, you know, this stuff was coming along and it was gonna change everything. And so the, the 2,600 and the the tac 33 <span style="color:red" data-ts="2343.485" data-end_ts="2343.845" title="2343.485" id=c_"2343.485">__forties__</span> got shoved in a basement room that I and all the other freshmen got to play in. Right. Uhhuh <affirmative>. But I'm wondering, you know, for me, I always, because I learned synthesis on that, it's always been a thing that has called me back. Hmm. But it sounds like less so for you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Yeah, I'm, I kind of feel like, well it's, it's obviously evolved so much. Right. You know, it's so much better today than it was when we were, you know, working on the classic systems. Right, right. I mean, there's so much more possibilities. I feel like I, I, I can't stand having an instrument in my house if I'm not really making music with it and really playing with it. Sure. You know, like if somebody gave me a MiniMogue, I'd wanna get rid of it because I wouldn't be doing anything with it, you know? Right. I'd just noodle around with it once in a while. I'd, I'd admire how great it sounds. Maybe I'd study it a little, but I wouldn't be making music with it. Right. So I would want somebody else to have it. I'd feel guilty having, having this great instrument that I'm not, not really putting to good use. Right. I really like having everything in my computer. I, I like having everything in my laptop. Having a real, it's, it's just so compact. So I'm not real tempted by it, but I'm, I'm real curious about it as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Well, I think also having come up during a time when a studio looked like a room now having a studio look like a hardcover book is, there's a lot of, there's a lot of new flexibility and interesting opportunities that come from something like that. So. Right. We've burned through our time, as always happens. It was fantastic talking to you. I appreciate you taking the time Before I, I let you go though. I am curious, what do you imagine, what do you see as some of the most exciting stuff in the near term future? You mentioned before being a little fascinated with modal synthesis. I'm not sure I even know what that is. Okay. But, so, but, you know, tell us a little bit about what you think are some future technologies that are pretty important. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Okay. You know, we're, we're at a time where it really feels like everything's been done in terms of synthesis. If you're looking at it in terms of what are the known synthesis techniques and what's been implemented and what's available as a product, it seems like everything's been done right. Seems like everything's been modeled. Everything's, you know, all the stuff you I would've read about in computer music journal or something. There's something that can do that on the market. Right. So as a designer, it's kind of really, it can be really depressing, but my, the way I see it is I don't really focus so much on like techniques and stuff, and I think more what kind of sounds aren't possible today. What kind of sounds would be really hard to synthesize today. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And why, why is that, you know, what's missing that would make it possible to, synthesize any, any possible sound theoretically, you know, that's, that, that, that's kind of, that would be m like my ultimate goal. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Sure. Unattainable, unattainable goal, <laugh> something, you know, maybe, maybe in <span style="color:red" data-ts="2554.565" data-end_ts="2554.685" title="2554.565" id=c_"2554.565">__a__</span> 300 years people could do it, but to have a synthesizer that could make any possible sound. Right. And so in terms of techniques, I, I think of techniques that, that have more complex data sets. Like, additive synthesis, for example, modal synthesis is like additive synthesis, except it's using filters. Got it. Instead of, oscillators. Okay. Basically you have a bank, you have a bank of band pass filters, each one is turned tuned to a resonant node Okay. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2584.565" data-end_ts="2584.645" title="2584.565" id=c_"2584.565">__Of__</span> the system. You're, you're emulating or synthesizing and then you play sounds through that. I see. In, in, in that sense, it makes it much more flexible than, additive synthesis. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Because you don't have, I mean, oscillators are kind of rigid. Right. Filters are interesting 'cause you can play any sound through the filter. So you get some of the flexibility of additive synthesis in that, you know, you can adjust the frequencies of each oscillator to whatever you want. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So you end up with this complex set of data, you know, there's a bunch of, bunch of parameters in there, and you have to find a way to manage that. And I think those are the kinds of things we'll see more in the future. You know, spectrums, things like that more than just a, an individual parameter that's like a knob. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>And there's a certain amount of that in absence. I mean, the, the breakpoint envelopes are, to me that kind of a parameter. You know, it's, it's this sort of complex thing that has a certain complex sort of behavior to it or the waveforms <span style="color:red" data-ts="2649.245" data-end_ts="2649.365" title="2649.245" id=c_"2649.245">__an__</span> absence. And, this could, could expand <span style="color:red" data-ts="2652.915" data-end_ts="2653.205" title="2652.915" id=c_"2652.915">__into__</span> different, different things like, modal synthesis, I think. But, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, very interesting. That's, that's a great overview and a great, some great conceptual ideas. Well, Brian, I want to thank you so much for your time. It was fabulous talking to you. I learned an awful lot about you, but also about, your journey. That was really, really great to learn. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Well, thanks a lot for having me. It was great. Great talking with you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Indeed. And, next time I'm in France, we'll have to go out and share a bottle of wine or something. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Yes, definitely. That'd be awesome. Get in touch. All 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Will do. All right. Thank you so much and I will talk to you again soon. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian: </b>Thanks. Bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Hey, I'm out on the road this weekend, but I just thought I'd, give a quick thanks to Brian for the discussion. Great interview, huh. And, to thank all of you for continuing listening and for passing the word along. Let other people know about this one. It's pretty interesting because I don't think a lot of interviews have been out there with Brian Clevinger and the guy's amazing. So, let's give him a little support, helps support my podcast, and just learn more about the people in our art. Thanks a lot, and I'll talk to <span style="color:red" data-ts="2730.925" data-end_ts="2731.005" title="2730.925" id=c_"2730.925">__you__</span> soon. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2731.305" data-end_ts="2731.525" title="2731.305" id=c_"2731.305">__Bye__</span>.
