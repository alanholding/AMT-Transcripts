<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. This week we have an interesting guest. He's somebody that I first met through my interaction with, the Little Bits company. Paul has been working with them and, worked with me during the development of, of their interface bits. And I got a chance to use them early and often. I had a blast with 'em. They're, they're amazingly fun. But, with that, I'd like to introduce you to Paul Rothman Hi, Paul. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul Rothman: </b>Good, thanks, Darwin Great to be here on the show with you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, thanks so much for joining us. It's a real treat to be able to have you take a little time outta your schedule. I know you're a busy guy, and, give us a chance to talk a little bit. Why don't we start off by having you explain your, your job to us, your gig? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Sure, sure. So, I'm currently the director of r and d at Little Bits. And so I've sort of, spanned a couple of different positions at the company. I started there, when the company was first getting off the ground in, 2011. Initially <span style="color:red" data-ts="82.18" data-end_ts="82.4" title="82.18" id=c_"82.18">__ju__</span> just working with our, with the founder, <span style="color:red" data-ts="84.9" data-end_ts="85.12" title="84.9" id=c_"84.9">__IA__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="85.15" data-end_ts="85.44" title="85.15" id=c_"85.15">__Bair__</span>, as an electronics, designer, basically doing P c b layouts and module designs, you know, electrical engineering for the, for the product. And, you know, as the team has grown, I've kind of shifted around between engineering and design. And at this point as, as a director of r <span style="color:red" data-ts="107.28" data-end_ts="107.36" title="107.28" id=c_"107.28">__and__</span> d, I mostly just work, more on a conceptual, and partially like logistics and execution level with the product. I don't get to get my hands dirty and, and solder and, and do p c b designs, anymore. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Unfortunately, you know, at sometimes. But, but yeah, mostly working on sort of the, the concepts for the modules, the features and the layouts of the, the, the designs of the, of the interfaces and things like that for the product. As well as, you know, sometimes, partnerships like, like, some of the, the partnership that we did with <span style="color:red" data-ts="151.39" data-end_ts="151.68" title="151.39" id=c_"151.39">__Cord__</span>, creating the synth kit. So, you know, it's, it's a, it's a really great position I get to kind of really kind of think and ideate and try to come up with the, with the next cool thing for the, for the product line. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. That's, that's really interesting. What a, what a fantastic job. You must be kinda loving life a little bit, huh? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So I'm curious, because the kind of things you get a chance to do is the kind of things a lot of people would like to do, right? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, what <span style="color:red" data-ts="186.72" data-end_ts="186.88" title="186.72" id=c_"186.72">__is__</span>, what is your background and how did you get to be in the position you're in? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>So I started out, well, I mean, if I go further back, you know, I was always really interested in, you know, taking things apart as a kid. I think that's common, a common thread in a lot of people that are kind of in, you know, an engineering sort of design, BA background. And so yeah, always interested in electronics. I kind of started, getting into electronics, actually through music, you know, trying to come up with, new sounds and building guitar pedals and things like that. <span style="color:red" data-ts="230.54" data-end_ts="230.76" title="230.54" id=c_"230.54">__And__</span> in high school, that was sort of my first introduction. Two electronics was by, you know, trying to build things to make weird sounds with, so I, I went to, N Y U for college, and I ended up, getting into the, music technology program there. And, and, you know, par partially that that program is about just, you know, you know, more traditional music training, you know, theory and, and history and things like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>But then also a large part of the curriculum is, you know, getting into, you know, basic electronics and, you know, studio recording, synthesis. You know, my first introduction to to Max m s p, was in a class that Luke Dubois was teaching at N Y U, basically, an intro to computer music synthesis. And, and that's when I first learned about Max and, and got into, you know, programming, software. And, you know, I also had my first encounters with analog since they had a, an old <inaudible> 100, system that everybody kind of cut their teeth on, in school. And so, you know, that was kind of, that was kind of really solidifying for me getting the chance to, you know, really work on, on music and electronics, which kind of became my two simultaneous passions. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And after school, <span style="color:red" data-ts="323.88" data-end_ts="324" title="323.88" id=c_"323.88">__I__</span>, I finished school, I wanted to try to see if I could do that full time, and I started making guitar pedals and kind of one-off, synths in, in my bedroom, you know, kind of quickly realized the eco, the, the economy of that was a, was a little, was a little difficult, to, to do, at the time in, especially in New York. So I, I ended up, going back to school. I got a, a graduate degree also at N Y U in Interaction Design. And, and it was actually when I was a student that I met, <span style="color:red" data-ts="362.52" data-end_ts="362.72" title="362.52" id=c_"362.52">__AYA__</span>, who, who was working on little bits at the time. And this was in 2009. That was basically a project that she was working on that she was getting, some grant funding from an arts organization called I-Beam. And so I started working with her, as, as an intern, basically just working on early concepts of the system before there was, a connector to really hold everything together. We kept in touch, and so I kind of kept doing the freelance electronics work and design for folks. And then once the company got started in, in 2011, I joined, straight away, and we've just been kind of working at it, ever since. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Well, that's really an interesting, lead in, and I, I find it really interesting that, that you kind of have this combination of music technology from N Y U and then the interactive design or interaction design, you know, that's kind of an extension of the typical media arts, but one that's really growing in, in importance. You see it a lot with people that are focusing on a lot of times in the software world. You're seeing them focused on user interaction, you know, the, the typical UX kind of gig. But it's really interesting to hear about interaction design as part of like hardware development and especially development that includes electronics. Is is it as, is it as strange as I think, or am I just missing, am I just missing the boat on what's out there? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>I don't know. I don't know how strange it is. I guess I definitely would say that when I was in, when I was in my undergrad at N Y U, there weren't that many people doing electronics. A lot of the program, a lot of my classmates were, were much heavier into the recording aspect of the program. That was a, you know, that was what the bulk of the, of the students were doing. They were, you know, musicians and really interested in being audio engineers and producers. I see. <span style="color:red" data-ts="496.36" data-end_ts="496.6" title="496.36" id=c_"496.36">__Which__</span>, which was great. And, and I, I was interested in that stuff too, but it just didn't capture my imagination quite as much as, you know, being in the studio with the ULA and, you know, the MS 20 and, and, and cutting a quarter inch tape and Right. And all that kind of stuff, and, you know, experimenting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And so yeah, that's really sort of what captured my imagination and, and interacting with all of the different instruments and interfaces now sparked something in me. I guess we also had a, an E m Ss, a VCs three, the Putney, right? Another kind of classic synth and a very interesting interface with the patch, with the matrix, patch panel that it has. So, you know, kind of jumping from modular to semi modular to this sort of patch matrix and, and all these different sorts of interfaces and looking at different ways to approach, approach music creation and, and, and the hardware behind it. So I wanted to sort of be in that, in that field. And so, you know, kind of getting into creating the guitar pedals and the synths, and, and at that point, I was still really, I was learning a lot. I think the guitar pedal was actually the first P C B that I designed right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And ended up being something I was manufacturing and, and selling to people into stores. So, you know, that was a, a learning experience and something that was really interesting. And then when I got to the interactive telecommunications program at N Y U, I really just focused on designing instruments as much as I could. You know, I took other classes that, that were doing different things, coding and, and different sorts of interactions. But whenever I could do a project that ended up being the result was me building some sort of electronic instrument or some way of, of, making a, a sound interface that was sort of what I was always gravitating toward, you know, sticking to, sticking to what I was, I was passionate about, when the opportunities kind of arose. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So I'm curious, what, what guitar pedals is it that you made? What, what names did they go under? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>So yeah, the, the company's called, fridge Buzz Electronics. And, I was basically just manufacturing at, at scale a single pedal that I, that I'd created. I was doing other sort of like one-offs and, and things like that for specific people, like custom stuff. But the pedal, <span style="color:red" data-ts="647.46" data-end_ts="647.68" title="647.46" id=c_"647.46">__is__</span> called the Land of the Rising Fuzz, which is a fuzz pedal based on the Hinney Companion Fuzz, which is a kind of sought after pedal from the sixties that, you know, I, I got turned onto, because of its use by Radiohead and Jesus and Mary Chain. And I, I built one for myself and thought it sounded great, and I made a couple of modifications to it. And, you know, I just saw that people were selling the originals for 400, 500 bucks. And I thought, well, you know, I could make these in, sell 'em to people for a lot cheaper than that. Sure. And that's kind of how it started. I thought I would make like 25 to begin with. And then, you know, I think I ended up making probably around 175 in the end. So, and I, I still have some parts left, that I feel like I'll eventually build out in the future, but, I kind of hung up the lab coat on, on that for the, for the time being just to Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Hung up the soldering iron, huh? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Yeah, exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. So, now during this time when you were making instruments and stuff, you, you, <span style="color:red" data-ts="719.8" data-end_ts="720" title="719.8" id=c_"719.8">__on__</span> time let slip, when we were talking, you let slip that you had been to Nime, which is the, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>You interfaces for Musical Express. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>There you go. I always forget what the n is for <laugh> new interfaces for musical expression. Right. What, what did you do and what did you show at Nime? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>So that what I, what I showed at <span style="color:red" data-ts="743.57" data-end_ts="743.85" title="743.57" id=c_"743.57">__Nime__</span>, and this was in the, the 2010 <span style="color:red" data-ts="747.59" data-end_ts="747.81" title="747.59" id=c_"747.59">__nme__</span>, conference in Sydney, Australia, if anybody's curious in looking up the, the paper that I submitted. But I wrote a paper about an instrument that I designed, which was actually my, my, my master's thesis, which was an instrument that I, that I called the ghost, which was a MIDI controller that was sort of reprogrammable, partly inspired by the mono, that, that Brian Crabtree designed, partially inspired by the, Suzuki Omni <span style="color:red" data-ts="779.46" data-end_ts="779.81" title="779.46" id=c_"779.46">__chord__</span>. Oh, yeah. And partially inspired by just the electric guitar. So I kind of made a new interface pulling different ideas from all three of those. So the thing actually looks like a guitar, and you press buttons with your left hand, and you strum a touch sensitive plate with your right hand. But that's sort of like where the similarity start, stop. It's not, the, the buttons aren't a one-to-one translation to guitar. It's just, my thinking was that so many times people try to come up with a completely new interface and it falls flat because it's just strange to people. So I thought, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. It's right. It's too foreign. It's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Too foreign. Exactly. And I'd say probably the electric guitar is the last, you know, new instrument, I guess you, I mean, you could say the synthesizer, but again, both of those are also playing off of previously designed instruments, you know, piano, you know, synthesizer is using a keyboard, you know, going back to like piano and harpsichord and everything. And, you know, you could make an argument that a guitar is a modern day loot or something. So playing off of the, the form factor of the guitar so that people wouldn't look at it and be like, oh, that's, that's weird. I wouldn't wanna be, you know, on stage with something like that. And just because people are familiar with the gestures, you know, you, you're, you're moving your hand, you know, along a neck and, and, and, and using your fingers to, to press down on an interface. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And the right hand is also partially controlling the, the sound as well. So the interesting thing, again, like pulling from the mono was that I was working on it being one open source, but also reprogrammable, so that there would be an interface that the user could select those buttons to mean anything. They could mean chords, they could mean individual notes. The scales could be set to anything that you wanted. And then also, you know, because it was, you know, a line of, of illuminated buttons, you could use it to be a sequencer and you could program, you know, drums along the neck and, and that kind of thing. And so, you know, there was some other performance controllers, like a ribbon controller and accelerometer in the body that you could tilt the instrument and it would do different things. So, that was something that I was interested in maybe pursuing as, as a instrument, as a controller to manufacture. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And I even, went as far as meeting with the folks at Livid down in Austin, Texas, who were, who were really great, really great guys, and met with me and kind of talked about manufacturing costs and things like that. And, and ultimately I just didn't feel like I was in a position to go into business for myself at that point. This was like pre Kickstarter, you know, really kind of getting off the ground and Right. You know, the idea of trying to raise capital for something like this seemed a bit daunting. So I, you know, it's been, hanging on my, hanging on my wall, in my apartment for the last five years. But, you know, it's a, it's a concept that I think is interesting and, and, you know, maybe one day would revisit it to, to see if there's a, a market for it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, it's interesting 'cause a while back I did, I did an interview with Keith McMillan, and he talked about, you know, he makes controllers of all sorts, but he at the time talked about how he thinks that there's, or at least his guess is that we're never going to in invent another instrument because we've gotten married to the shapes and the carriage of the instruments we currently have. So everything in the future will just be a hybrid of what we already have. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Yeah. I mean, I, part of me hopes that that's not true, but 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I know me too. But, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>But also I also, you know, see the landscape, you know, the, the Eigenharp came out, just about the same time that I was, that I was finishing up the, the ghost prototype. And you know, that has a lot of expression to it, and it sort of looks like an oboe, but it's also seemingly like very strange and futuristic and, you know, I don't know what the numbers are in terms of people that play that instrument, but, you know, I think that suffers the same kind of way. I think the most compelling things that I've seen recently are things like, well, I mean, this has been around for a while, but the haken continuum I think is a really interesting interface. I agree. I've never actually played one, but you know, from what I've seen it, it seems like it's very expressive and again, kind of lending itself to a keyboard type interface, but adding these extra axes and things like that, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The, or, or like the new, the new Rolly seaboard. Yeah. Again, similar, they, what they're able to do is they build off an interface that we've, we not only understand, but music's been written for this stuff, right? Yeah. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And so we could take advantage of the, of sort of like the content capability that we already have and just bring some new controller <span style="color:red" data-ts="1112.04" data-end_ts="1112.36" title="1112.04" id=c_"1112.04">__stick__</span> things along for the ride. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Yeah. The Rollie, I think that the, the, it's the seaboard is a really interesting thing. I, I've also never played it, but it's something that has interest. I'm not a, a virtuo, piano player by any means, but it's something that you can sit down and just sort of immediately play. I think that the, the interesting thing is thinking, is there a new instrument that somebody would have to step into without any sort of previous, previous knowledge of it, you know, sitting down to the Rollie, if you play the piano, you can play that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, maybe now the other thing is, so I have played a Rollie Uhhuh <affirmative>, and one of the things is since it has sort of like a multidimensional controller to it, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The things you think of as like piano playing don't seem to fire off the sensors in just the, quite the way you'd hope mm-hmm. <affirmative> or you'd expect, okay. And so I think that that's one of those things where maybe keyboard technique is an okay starting point. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, but you would have to, you would have to develop technique specific to that instrument uhhuh in order to really activate the controllers and stuff. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Yeah. And I think that's more, that's more interesting is when you're looking at looking at an instrument where you need to not just bring experience you have from another instrument, but generate new technique. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>I, you know, from what I've seen from the, instrument that Roger Lin just, debuted, you know, also seems like some of the theory and some of the ideas from, from the keyboard and from guitar would, would benefit somebody sitting down to the instrument. But at the same time, you know, you can kind of, you, you would bring something, the instrument would bring something new out of you in terms of the, the expression. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Wow. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1239.11" data-end_ts="1239.4" title="1239.11" id=c_"1239.11">__That__</span> this is interesting. And it's especially interesting because you've had to approach it from the standpoint of actually making an instrument. Now, one of the things I want to explore a little bit is, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1250.1" data-end_ts="1250.32" title="1250.1" id=c_"1250.1">__huh__</span>, well, what a funny use of words is your, is the development of the little bits, I mean mm-hmm. <affirmative>, it sounds like you were there right from the early days. And I'm wondering to what extent, first of all, your experience with not only building instruments, but also working with modular synthesizers and, semi modulars and a lot of different sort of creative interfaces. How much of that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1276.03" data-end_ts="1276.32" title="1276.03" id=c_"1276.03">__real__</span> did was informing to you when it came to developing the little bits? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>I, I mean, I think, I think a lot of it, especially with the synth kit, I mean, the synth kit, I don't think would've, it wouldn't have been possible if I didn't have those previous, experiences with analog synthesizers and, and, and, and music technology. That was an idea that I, you know, kind of was, felt really passionate about from the time that the company started. And, and it was always one of those things that was, you know, let's see, let's see when that would make sense in the trajectory of the company. Because o obviously when we started, it wasn't about music. It's, you know, it's just about electronics in general. So our first modules were things like buttons and LEDs and motors and sensors, like for pressure and for light and, and, knobs, you know, for, you know, like rotary, rotary potentiometers and things like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>So, you know, I think having, having experience with, you know, some of these modular elements and just also being very focused on interface <span style="color:red" data-ts="1348.94" data-end_ts="1349.16" title="1348.94" id=c_"1348.94">__as__</span>, as, as a musician and, and dealing with musical instruments, you know, so much of what the little bits product is, is interface and keeping that simple and keeping that intuitive, so that people who, you know, don't have backgrounds in electronics aren't running away because they think that this is something for engineers. Right. You know, so a lot of it is just really about distilling the essence of the, the electronic function that you want to provide people and not have it be over featured and not have it fall flat from, you know, what the intention is. So, you know, yeah. I think it, I think it's played a, a, a, a strong, a strong part in sort of the, my, my contribution to the, to the development of the product. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, I think actually too, some history with guitar pedals would make a lot of sense, because if you think about it in terms of, in terms of music, instrument technology, and especially electronics technology mm-hmm. <affirmative>, the guitar pedal is sometimes can be phenomenally, expressive and certainly phenomenally complicated potentially. But that complication and that expressive expressivity needs to occur within something that is small enough to sort of like be on the floor and maybe have two buttons and maybe have as many as five knobs. But anything more than that becomes impractical for that kind of device. Mm-hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b><affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So you end up having to do, you would end up having to do some, like, rationalization of the user interface. And I, and I look at guitar pedals, and I think sometimes the user interface design is remarkably mature. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1464.1" data-end_ts="1464.32" title="1464.1" id=c_"1464.1">__And__</span> in that, you know, and especially in well-designed electronics, you know, a single knob might have multiple effects on the sound. And some of it is because like, if you're doing an overdrive, that's just the nature of an overdrive system, but also indicate, you know, if you're doing something like a, an expressive delay pedal, you need to, you, you simply can't have a knob for every function. So you have to somehow collate those into a usable interface. And I think that guitar pedal design is, is kind of a remarkable area and one that was developed really organically. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Yeah. I mean, if you look, and I mean, I'd say <span style="color:red" data-ts="1505.82" data-end_ts="1506.04" title="1505.82" id=c_"1505.82">__the__</span>, the trajectory is, is similar. If you look at guitar pedals from the sixties, the, you know, the original ones, there's an on-off switch and maybe one or two controls, maybe you're controlling, you know, the, the volume or the gain and tone, you know, for the early fuzz pedals. And now, I mean, if you look at some fuzz pedals, you know, there could be, you know, half a dozen or more controls to, to tweak, you know, every little parameter. And, and so, you know, I I I, I have a sort of a design aesthetic that lends itself towards restraint right. Over over features. And so, you know, and, and I think also with synthesizers a similar sort of thing as technology progresses, you know, there's, the interface has become a lot more cluttered, there's more options, which is great. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>But at the same time, at least in my view of it, you're kind of going away from, you know, some of the original concept, which is, is like this user interface that is intuitive. I, you know, sometimes I feel like hardware, at some point you might as well just do it in a computer, right. Because the, because the interface becomes so complicated. I'm, I'm pretty strongly against menus in that regard. <laugh>, if, if it goes beyond, you know, pressing a shift key or something like that to change the function of a bank of buttons, I sort of lose interest with the instrument just because I wanna be, you know, really present with it and not have to think about how it's functioning so much. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, I agree completely. And, and actually even, even on the computer, if, if you have to go through too many mode screens or whatever, it simply becomes uninteresting to explore the editing functions then mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Now, in terms of like minimalist design, you probably have the ultimate job for that because, so my, my background with little bits was that I got an opportunity, somebody came to a local meetup and showed the little bits, the, the synth kit, and, they gave us a little coupon for 20% off or something mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And so I used the coupon to get it, and I started playing with it, and I was like, wow, you know, this is, this is fun. And I actually even built a little part of a live set that would use 'em. It was, it was pretty great. But, I was also kind of a amazed by the difficult decisions that must have been made, because there are, I mean, how many, when you connect a little bits together, and for those people who are listening who haven't seen it yet, you need to go to little bits.cc and check out what these are, because they're sort of like electronics legos. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It is the closest thing I can imagine to describing 'em in a phrase. But all of the signal content is carried over some lines in this magnetic hookup. How many actual signal lines are there? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>So there's, there's four conductor or, or three conductors that go through the system, one of which is ground, one of which is power, the V C C line. And then there's just one line of information, which is our, our signal pin, which is basically just sending, an, an analog voltage between zero and five volt DC from one module to the next. And so it's, it's a very simple kind of infrastructure that we have right now. But you can end up doing quite a bit of it. So, you know, the, the closest analog, you know, would be in a modular synth, you're just using voltages to control the interaction between modules. There's no digital protocol, at the moment. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. So the concept really is when you string up a line of these, it, it, it's almost like the, like the traditional guitar pedal stream or whatever, where it's like items connected by a single cable. That's literally how simple the signal flow is, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Yeah. Yeah. And, and similar to, you know, somebody using guitar pedals, the sound changes depending on how you have them connected, you know, the order matters, and there's different sort of logic that happen between one to the next. So, you know, if you put a, a delay module in front of an oscillator, it's going <span style="color:red" data-ts="1776.24" data-end_ts="1776.32" title="1776.24" id=c_"1776.24">__to__</span> do something different than if you put the delay after the oscillator. So it leaves a lot of room for experimentation in that way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I would say that when I first tried it, I was a little bit frustrated with how almost overly simplistic it seemed mm-hmm. <affirmative> until I started realizing that the way that that system was is because of the simple signal pla path. What it, what it really did to me was it kind of referenced playing with the order of things, and especially trying things that are outside the typical signal flow. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. So like you said, you know, the idea of putting a delay in front of a, in front of a, of an oscillator seems crazy, or, you know, one of the things I love doing, I love playing with the split and mix, bits mm-hmm. <affirmative> and splitting things out and processing them differently, and then recombining them and maybe using delays to combine them, you know, with, with phase offsets and stuff. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, it was fascinating because I found myself doing things with, I have a nice, I have some really nice modular synth stuff mm-hmm. <affirmative>, and I found myself doing things with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1848.28" data-end_ts="1848.48" title="1848.28" id=c_"1848.28">__the__</span> little bits that I'd never conceived of doing with the modular system. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Yeah. I think, you know, it, it, that's, that's one of the interesting things in a lot of musicians that, that I've sent kits out to. That's the exact feedback that I get, which is that, you know, this, this allowed me to do something that I wouldn't have done if I sat down at, at my modular or at my, you know, my, my semi modular synth or, or whatever. And so that's the, that's the thing that I really enjoy about it, is the fact that it is kind of a new interface in the way that, the way that you think about it is different from, I call it a traditional, you know, analog synthesizer. So it makes you do things that you maybe wouldn't normally do, but also like a modular synth, having more modules allows you to do more things. So, you know, if you had a, a URAC synth where you just had, you know, one oscillator and one envelope and one V C F, you're limited. But once you start multiplying those, you can have all these parallel signal and control paths going and, and doing some really interesting things. So the walls are really wide in the system, in, in the sense that you can kind of branch out, even though on a singular module level, the features are not deep. It's more about how the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1936.58" data-end_ts="1936.8" title="1936.58" id=c_"1936.58">__mo__</span>, how you have the modules interact with one another to get these sort of interesting and, and new kind of, sounds. Right 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, the synth kit was developed in combination with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1947.79" data-end_ts="1948.08" title="1947.79" id=c_"1947.79">__Corg__</span>, who's known for making very traditional instruments. Now, recently, they've kind of branched off into the, like, historical world of making, you know, remaking MS 20 type devices. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, their VUCA series is kind of an, a really interesting new I interface, but this to me was a real departure because while musical, it didn't, it doesn't seem instrument like on its surface. How did you get them interested in the product and in working with it? And what was the process of working with them like? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Yeah, it's actually really interesting. So, the partnership goes back to 2012 actually. And, and like I said, I had this concept in sketches for a little bits based synthesizer sort of platform. And so it had kind of just been sitting in a, in a, in a notebook for a while because we were tr trying to build out more sort of traditional modules. And then at the end of 2012, we received an email from, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2019.51" data-end_ts="2019.8" title="2019.51" id=c_"2019.51">__Tico__</span>, samaki from corg who is, in charge of their product planning, saying, Hey, I'm gonna be in New York, and, and what you're doing is interesting. Can we have a meeting? And so, you know, we ended up talking, they were interested in basically working with us on the idea that we were already interested in doing, which was, you know, synthesis, and audio within the, within the little bit system. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And, you know, I think Corrigan particular for me was a great fit because they had shown in the, in the couple of years preceding that, that they were interested in these non-traditional interfaces. And, and so, you know, at the time, back in 2012, there were no ulca, but they did have the mono tron series, which were, you know, are still these $50 pocket analog synthesizers. It sort of clicked in, in the sense that, well, they're already making these devices that are geared towards not a professional musician, market, although I'm sure professional musicians would buy a mono tron or a mono <span style="color:red" data-ts="2094.65" data-end_ts="2095" title="2094.65" id=c_"2094.65">__tribe__</span> and play around with it, but it's more trying to reach out to the general public and introducing them to a synthesizer. You know, a $50 commitment is nothing compared to several hundred dollars or several thousand dollars that, that a synthesizer could, could cost. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And so that to me was really interesting. And also the fact that the designer of those who worked and, had worked with us on the synth kit and some of the new modules, tatsuya, and so he had these, had these other ideas around, you know, making those products, although kind of not officially, but unofficially hackable by having these test points and these breakout pads within the circuit board. So if you take a mono tron apart, there'll be a pad that you could potentially connect to your own electronics in Arduino or something like that. And so it's that sort of spirit that really jelled with me and with our, with the company, because we make all of our electronics open source. And so the idea that, you know, people are gonna be potentially hacking or, you know, opening up and, and taking a look at what makes these instruments tick, and the fact that they released the schematics for the mono tron, I thought was really interesting. And I kind of saw kindred spirits in, in <span style="color:red" data-ts="2183.83" data-end_ts="2184.12" title="2183.83" id=c_"2183.83">__Tako__</span> and Tatsuya in that regard, which just made it really easy decision to say, you know, let's collaborate on this, on this product together. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Absolutely. That makes a lot of sense. You're right. Now my question would be, what is the process of designing these things? Because with the synth synth kit, there had to be <span style="color:red" data-ts="2204.68" data-end_ts="2204.8" title="2204.68" id=c_"2204.68">__a__</span> totality of vision. You had to be able to say, you know, this is what is going to represent an instrument or an instrument building kit to us. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>The, the interesting thing about the development of the synth kit is that it had to be, more of a holistic approach, designing several modules at a time, and basically that whole kit at once, because in 2013, when we did the bulk of the design, we didn't have any audio capabilities in the system. And so with the, with the more traditional development path for us, we are creating an individual module that will add functionality to, to the system as a whole. So, for example, you know, we have a, a cloud bit module, which allows you to connect little bits to a wifi network. So that's one module that's expanding all of the other buttons and, LEDs and motors and things in the system. But with the synthesizer, we couldn't just release an oscillator and then a keyboard, and then an envelope. We had to design all of these at once with the notion that they were gonna be packaged in a kit that would be an entire synthesizer experience. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And so we went back and forth on a lot of different configurations and, and what modules needed to be in the kit and what were the nice to haves. And, and we actually ended up using, at, at, KO's recommendation, we actually ended up using Max to basically simulate the kit. So each one of the modules that we were discussing, the oscillator, the delay, all of these, modules, was built out by, by <span style="color:red" data-ts="2307.3" data-end_ts="2307.72" title="2307.3" id=c_"2307.3">__Tarico__</span> and his team in Max. And then we would go back <span style="color:red" data-ts="2311.78" data-end_ts="2312" title="2311.78" id=c_"2311.78">__and__</span> we would go back and forth on saying, well, okay, but this interaction between this module is a little bit weird and we need to adjust the range of this control. And so by the time we started actually working on the hardware designs, we had kind of specked out how the system would work using Max M s P as, as sort of a, a, a simulation, application. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>So it was really interesting to kind of take the approach of software to hardware in terms of the development of it. And so yeah, there were, there were back and forths and, and concessions that had to be made. I know, you know, one of the things that we thought would be really interesting, and the kit was gonna be to have a looper in there so that you could, you know, basically build up a composition by, by looping sounds, but ultimately in terms of like timeline and price consideration, we had to, we had to cut that, but there were a lot of different sort of back and forth and configurations that we, that we went through during that design process, which was, which was really interesting and, and really rewarding and, and, you know, definitely something I, you know, look back on, on fondly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, it, it sounds like it was a pretty exciting thing to do, and this idea of idea developing the interaction before you start making, making the hardware sounds pretty compelling as well. Oh, and one thing I'll say, there's currently a one, one of the things you guys do is you decide who's, what the next bits are that are gonna be made by, through a voting system, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>For some of the modules. Yeah. We launched in September, this platform called the bitlab, which is basically a, a section of our website where people can submit videos and, and prototype concepts for new modules. And those modules will get voted on, by the public. And so the modules that reach a thousand votes, we look at really closely decide on whether or not, you know, the, the features are something that would be worthwhile for the little bits platform, if we can build it at a price point that, you know, will, will be, you know, palatable for, for our customers, and then put those into production. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Well, I'll just say this right now, one of the current voting items is the L F O bit mm-hmm. <affirmative>, which I beg all of my listeners to run over there and vote for, because it would be a fantastic addition to the synth kit. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Yeah. And, and an interesting thing about that module is that that was actually a part of the, the original design of the synth kit, but we were using it just as a, as an oscillator module. And so the, the original oscillator design was digital. We just thought that we could get a more richer sound experience by designing an analog oscillator, which is what we ended up doing. And so the design for the, the, the oscillator, the digital one kind of fell by the wayside, and we resurrected it, kind of recently just by adjusting the range in software to make it a, a, a low frequency, oscillator. And so we decided to, you know, put it up for <span style="color:red" data-ts="2509.84" data-end_ts="2510.12" title="2509.84" id=c_"2509.84">__vote__</span> to see if it would be something that would be of interest. And I have to say, having, having the only prototype, it's, it's a really, really cool thing and it, it, it unlocks a lot for not only synth users, but for users of the other, of the, the whole full line, because you can control LEDs and you can control motors in ways that you couldn't with these long timing cycles. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>And it has, also, a wave shaping control. So you can change the pulse width of the pulse wave, and you can con, you can change the, wave form of the triangle saw to have it morph between a sawtooth, a triangle, and a ramp wave. So it adds a lot, of interesting functionality. So yeah, I think there's about two weeks left. I think we're, we, we are about 70% of the way as far as voting goes, so I'm hoping that, you know, the community, you know, comes through, sees the value of it and, and, and goes to the website to, to vote for it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Agreed. I, I hope so too. Now, just recently, and, and where I got involved more directly was in the release of these interface bits mm-hmm. <affirmative>, what, what did you call the set of 'em? I am, I can't remember off the top of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2592" data-end_ts="2592.08" title="2592" id=c_"2592">__it__</span>. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>So we've, yeah, we've combined them and we just called them the synth pro pack because Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2597.9" data-end_ts="2598.12" title="2597.9" id=c_"2597.9">__You__</span> know, it allows you to connect the synth kit, which was kind of formally an island into itself to all of the other, you know, gear that you would have in your studio. So, we have a module that connects to MIDI both, you know, traditional midi <span style="color:red" data-ts="2613.52" data-end_ts="2613.64" title="2613.52" id=c_"2613.52">__d__</span> as well as, U S B midi. We have a module that is U S B I O, which is basically U s B audio interface that's DC coupled. So it can be used as a recording and playback interface as well as a control interface, which is where you get to do a lot of really cool interaction with Max. Right. And then a third module, which is, cv, module control voltage, which allows you to connect to analog synths modulars, you know, you can sync with your, with, like the ULCA line, which have, you know, an analog sync input and output. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Even the new, teenage engineering, pocket operators synths, could be connected to the synth kit, via the CV module. So, you know, yeah, it's really exciting. It's stuff that we had talked about in the original kit, adding MIDI and, and all of these other connection, in interface modules, but in terms of time, to development, we just didn't have the, the resources to, to do those simultaneously. So we, we finished the synth kit, released it, and then basically a few months later started working on the, those new modules, which we just released less than a month ago now. Right. They're, they're really awesome. It kind of expands what you can do with the synth kit to definitely a more, not that you couldn't use it for professional purposes, you know, beforehand there's been some great musicians that, that have used the synth kit, but now being able to control it from a, from a, you know, full-size keyboard or have it be connected to <span style="color:red" data-ts="2713.5" data-end_ts="2713.72" title="2713.5" id=c_"2713.5">__Max__</span> allows you to do, you know, more sort of traditional, use it as a more traditional instrument in the workflow of, of a user's music studio. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. One of the things I too found was that with the interface, with the interface bits, it made me more interested in using the non synth bits. Yeah. So, for example, all of a sudden I've, I started using l e d bits a lot more because they turned out to be really good voltage, voltage meters. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Yeah, absolutely. I, I do that too. I'll, I'll stick LEDs, you know, in various parts of the signal flow, of a synth patch that I'm putting together just to, you know, kind of visualize what's going on. You know, we also have another module, which is, called the bar graph, which kind of can act like a VU meter. Yep. And another module called the number module, which, kind of allows you to get actual voltage information. It's basically like a, a volt meter in that it's a a two digit seven segment display interface. So if you wanted to, you know, capture the precise voltages that were coming out of, one of your setups, you could do that with that module. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Yeah. And one of the things I noticed was that once that interface kind of like opened the door to like patching it into my modular or patching it into, into my computer system, you know, both Macs and live, I was doing both a lot. One of the things I realized is that except for the, except for the motor, I never found a way to use the motor usefully. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2820.78" data-end_ts="2821" title="2820.78" id=c_"2820.78">__Oh__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2821" data-end_ts="2821.16" title="2821" id=c_"2821">__wow__</span>. But otherwise, practically everything could take on an interesting musical use. So, I bought one of the microphone modules mm-hmm. <affirmative>, which isn't, is neither a great microphone nor a great interface for audio. Right. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>We're, we're, we're working on, on an update to that that will hopefully, address some of those issues. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But what was cool about it was that first of all, it had an input jack mm-hmm. <affirmative>, so I could plug random stuff into it, but also I could use it as sort of an activator for things like the filter, right? Mm-hmm. <affirmative> in a, in a very peculiar, in a way that wasn't, again, wasn't something that I would've probably designed. It was, it was through the method of experimenting with the little bits that I actually found an interesting way to do that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Also, of, of great, great interest to the, the synth community we have are our sensor modules. So we have, you know, modules that, that, sense pressure, that sense bend that sense light in the future we're, we're potentially gonna have an accelerometer module. So all of these things that allow you to create a new interface, a new sort of physical way to interact with the sound is really interesting. And something that you don't find in a lot of traditional kind of store-bought synths, or even in the modular world that much, these alternative sort of interfaces that use physical control beyond a knob or environmental control, like, like, sound or, or light. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right Now, one of the things that I did not get a chance to do was to try and integrate the cloud bit mm-hmm. <affirmative> into, into the system, but practically everything else. And in including the Arduino bit, which was actually a lot of fun to work with as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>There was actually one other thing. Yeah. In terms of the, in terms of the other modules outside of the synth modules, that's pretty interesting that I saw actually just this week, which was one of our customers posted a video where he had connected his modular through our CV interface through the CV module to a servo module, and he had connected a drumstick to the servo module <laugh>, and had that hitting a cowbell <laugh>, basically, he was basically sinking, you know, an acoustic instrument to his modular synth using little bits as a bridge, which was something, you know, that, that I found to be really creative and interesting and, and, and hope to see more of in the future. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well there's, there's that motor interface that I couldn't come up with. That's pretty good. Yeah. It seems to me like, the musical angle on Little Bits has excited people if for no other reason, then you've kind of come out with additional, additional bits to sort of like honor that system. So I'm thinking it must be doing pretty well. What do you think are the next things in play for those of us who are kind of interested in expanding the synth stuff that that little bits provides? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Yeah. Yeah, I mean, it, it has definitely been one of our, our, our more popular kits, which is, which is really great. And I think from where we started <span style="color:red" data-ts="3020.94" data-end_ts="3021.16" title="3020.94" id=c_"3020.94">__and__</span>, and what we think of or what we thought of as like our user base, it's a really pleasant surprise how much musicians have have taken to it. And so the, in terms of the development of, of new modules on our end, outside of the L F O, which we could potentially produce if there's demand for it, you know, I think that some of the other interest more interesting modules will come in the form of control interfaces. So, like I was mentioning before, like other kinds of sensors or, or actuators that allow you to interact with the, with the sound modules in, in a different sort of way. And also I'm really interested in, in seeing what comes from the community. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="3064.23" data-end_ts="3064.52" title="3064.23" id=c_"3064.23">__This__</span>, the synth d I y d I Y scene is, is really strong. You know, I'd, I'd love to see more people from that scene, you know, coming up with designs and, and submitting them to the bitlab and, and just kind of having that community feedback and seeing what comes up, from, from that end of things. So that's kind of my hope and and outlook for, for where we'll sort of evolve. You know, I could see, a few more modules coming from the, the partnership of, of us in <span style="color:red" data-ts="3098.14" data-end_ts="3098.36" title="3098.14" id=c_"3098.14">__Cog__</span> in the future. But I, you know, my hope is that we'll actually see more coming from the community and, and more integration with the sort of larger little bit system, but with musical applications, like people writing programs for the Arduino that unlock something in the synth kit. You know, like, a midi looper where you would be able to record midi messages and have the Arduino loop that and play it out on multi-channels and, and stuff like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright, I'm gonna go off and work on that right now. <laugh> <laugh>, frankly, that sounds like something that'd be a lot of fun to implement and, and certainly, would be fun to, fun to share as well. Yeah. Paul, I want to thank you very much for, taking the time to talk to us about this. It was really fun to hear about how you got there, but also to hear how it, it's, it's clear from just talking to you how much you actually really enjoy, the things you're working on. So that's always enjoyable for, for us as well. Thank you so much for your time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Paul: </b>Yeah, thank you so much for having me. It's been a pleasure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So there you go. Thanks to, Paul for spending the time talking to us. It was really interesting to hear about, his work on creating stuff. I just love talking to people that have an active creating life. I want to thank everyone for continuing to keep on listening. I had a really interesting experience this last weekend. I, went to see Robert Rich in a house concert, which was just amazing. But beyond that, somebody heard me talking and came over and started talking to me. They're like, you, Darwin Gross. I recognize your voice. So, that's always kind of a, an interesting thing to have happen. But anyway, keep on listening. Reach out if you have any questions, comments, you can always hit me up at ddg@cyclingseventyfour.com or Darwin Gross, all one word with e at the end, on both Twitter and Facebook. And with that, I leave you to it. I'll see you next week. Thanks. Bye.
