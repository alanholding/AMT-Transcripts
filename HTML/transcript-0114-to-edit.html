<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today I am going to be talking with somebody who I was just recently introduced to. Gregory Taylor, pointed me to this guy and I started digging, and the more I dug into it, the more interesting I found it. So I kind of, rushed him into a quick interview. And so with that, I introduced you to Ricky Graham Hey, Ricky, how are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky Graham: </b>I am doing fine, Darwin How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm great. You, you know, a quick introduction for you would be that, you're an academic that teaches, sound and music at 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b>Stevens Institute of Technology. <span style="color:red" data-ts="48.895" data-end_ts="49.175" title="48.895" id=c_"48.895">__Yeah__</span>, there you go. <span style="color:red" data-ts="49.615" data-end_ts="49.775" title="49.615" id=c_"49.615">__<crosstalk>__</span> in New Jersey. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. And, additionally, you, you record and you perform under the name Signals under Tests. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b>That's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. And, the thing that I found really intriguing was not only your use of guitar in ambient music, <span style="color:red" data-ts="63.475" data-end_ts="63.695" title="63.475" id=c_"63.475">__the__</span> music that largely is owned by keyboard players, <laugh>, but also your development of something crazy called the Ssar. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Can you, can you explain what the SEPTA is? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b>Yeah, sure. It's actually a project off of the back of my, PhD project, at Alster University, which I wrapped up at <span style="color:red" data-ts="84.255" data-end_ts="84.495" title="84.255" id=c_"84.255">__about__</span> 2012. It was in collaboration with John Harding, who's a learning technologist and, hardware extraordinaire there. And essentially what the ssar does is it takes any kind of like midi guitar pickup system. And to be clear, there's absolutely no MIDI involved at this point. Essentially, all the ssar does is it parses out the audio per string and allows a guitar player to essentially process each string independently. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. As part of your blog, I saw you posting a picture of someone else who seemed to also be recording the six pickups and then actually pushing it back through the connector, so that then recorded. I, I couldn't even completely understand, but I think what was happening was the recorded pickup activity was actually exciting. The, the guitar synth device, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b>I'm not entirely sure which <laugh>, which <span style="color:red" data-ts="143.525" data-end_ts="143.815" title="143.525" id=c_"143.525">__blog__</span> post that is, but, essentially, you know, there, we've gone through two iterations of, of, of Sept <span style="color:red" data-ts="149.855" data-end_ts="149.935" title="149.855" id=c_"149.855">__are__</span> at this point. The first one was very much a DIY, you know, hacker maker kind of version, which, you know, we, we, you know, John produced the, the PCBs himself and, you know, we, we provided very basic hits to, to beta testers. Okay. So, this, I mean, it's not a new, I mean, you know, I'm kind of underselling the idea, but maybe <laugh>, but, it's not a new idea by any means. I mean, this idea of like processing registers, independently. Right. You know, the idea has been around for a very long time. In fact, I remember talking to Adrian <span style="color:red" data-ts="186.165" data-end_ts="186.445" title="186.165" id=c_"186.165">__free__</span> about this, back in I think 2009 ish. You know, and he was explained to me that, you know, John Martin, you know, British guitarist right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b>Had played around with these ideas like as early as the seventies, maybe late sixties, where he is breaking up, you know, acoustic guitar pickups so that, you know, he's processing top three registers differently than the bottom, through different, like, analog effects pedals. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So, I mean, <span style="color:red" data-ts="214.245" data-end_ts="214.445" title="214.245" id=c_"214.245">__the__</span>, the concept itself is actually pretty, pretty ancient. And of course then, you know, the mini guitar technology is pretty popular in the eighties and nineties. Right. But really the, the, the, this, my interest started when I started, speaking with, <span style="color:red" data-ts="228.585" data-end_ts="228.805" title="228.585" id=c_"228.585">__end__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="228.805" data-end_ts="228.965" title="228.805" id=c_"228.805">__of__</span> Bates, he's a composer, out at Dublin. He's a, was a Trinity College. And he started using it within a <span style="color:red" data-ts="236.805" data-end_ts="236.885" title="236.805" id=c_"236.805">__kinda__</span> electroacoustic composition context. So he was using it for, to take the audio from, all registers, but then he was using it primarily for specialization. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b>So he was kind of adapting the guitar for, you know, multi-channel compositions. And I just thought, man, that's just something I don't want to do <laugh>. Right. So, you know, and, and the circuit's not, not d it's not complex circuit. So, you know, John and I came up with our own version that, you know, it's just basic buffering and, a low <span style="color:red" data-ts="265.405" data-end_ts="265.565" title="265.405" id=c_"265.405">__pass__</span> filter, and it gives you a better frequency response <span style="color:red" data-ts="267.745" data-end_ts="267.965" title="267.745" id=c_"267.745">__out__</span>. If in our case it <span style="color:red" data-ts="269.045" data-end_ts="269.165" title="269.045" id=c_"269.045">__was__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="269.165" data-end_ts="269.365" title="269.165" id=c_"269.165">__the__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="269.465" data-end_ts="269.685" title="269.465" id=c_"269.465">__pay__</span> electric, pickups, like graph <span style="color:red" data-ts="271.955" data-end_ts="272.245" title="271.955" id=c_"271.955">__tech__</span> make. Right. And, yeah. I mean, and then that, you know, it just breaks out the audio. You jack <span style="color:red" data-ts="277.045" data-end_ts="277.165" title="277.045" id=c_"277.045">__it__</span> into your sign card and, you know, I do all kinds of crazy stuff in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data">PD</a> and Max, you know, the individuation that allows you to track pitch more, accurately, in software, you know, envelope followings pretty simple too. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And then, you know, there's a whole abundance of data that you can then map to all kinds of DSP from DSP. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Well, I think it's kinda interesting that guitar synthesis has actually gone from sort of like this commercial system where Roland would sell you a pickup that you would screw into your guitar face and then you would buy their synthesizer. I mean, that commercial thing that was getting a heavy push for a long time now, it seems to have fallen out of favor commercially, but is something that a lot of, like hackers and DIY people have kind of taken on as, as a challenge. Why, why do you think that is? Why do you think it moved away from commerciality and into more of a hacker space? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b>I think probably just frustration more than anything. <laugh>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="336.805" data-end_ts="336.845" title="336.805" id=c_"336.805">__I__</span> mean, <laugh>, with those kinds of units because, well, you know, the tracking's pretty decent on 'em. You know, we, I started hacking the Axon X 50, if you're familiar, Uhhuh <affirmative> with, with that and at, at at Stein and Amsterdam actually was the first kind of my first hacker project really. You know, I was, up until then, I was really just a guitarist that perform with Ableson Live. Okay. And then, you know, those folks encourage me to hack a lot of stuff. But, you know, to answer your question, I mean, I think that a lot of those promo, commercial products, you know, maybe the, sample banks are, you know, the types of signs that they produce are not really <span style="color:red" data-ts="374.475" data-end_ts="374.765" title="374.475" id=c_"374.475">__that__</span> interesting to a lot of guitarist folks. And I remember, you know, the idea of breaking white audio to, to, you know, each register as well, like, a lot of folks find that six or seven times harder depending on how many strings you have on your guitar. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b>Right. But beyond that, you know, it doesn't really fit with the aesthetic of, you know, rock music or, for example, you know, the distortions, polyphonic distortions, multichannel distortions. So a great deal difference to your typical, you know, magnetic, you know, sums pickups, as well. So there's, there's that <span style="color:red" data-ts="411.485" data-end_ts="411.645" title="411.485" id=c_"411.485">__too__</span>. You know, I don't know. I I really, I can only really answer from my perspective. You know, I, I like the hacker approach 'cause it's cheaper. I mean, a lot of these units cost like 500 plus bucks and, our little kit costs, you know, next to nothing really. I mean, you can get our version two off of OSH park for, <span style="color:red" data-ts="433.705" data-end_ts="433.925" title="433.705" id=c_"433.705">__you__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="433.925" data-end_ts="434.085" title="433.925" id=c_"433.925">__get__</span> three <span style="color:red" data-ts="434.305" data-end_ts="434.725" title="434.305" id=c_"434.305">__boards__</span>, three sets for like, I think it's 50, 60 bucks or something. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, wow. That's, that's cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b>It's cool. You know, and then, and then, you know, you're, it's a learning process too. So I think that maybe part of the interest is that, you know, you're, you're, you're putting this together yourself and <span style="color:red" data-ts="450.875" data-end_ts="451.165" title="450.875" id=c_"450.875">__that__</span> you're educating yourself and you're building something that's yours to further your practice rather than relying on, you know, some commercial product that's out there. Right. That's not to say that some of the commercial products that are out there are, you know, pretty interesting and, and definitely hold, hold <span style="color:red" data-ts="469.325" data-end_ts="469.645" title="469.325" id=c_"469.325">__merit__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Maybe, although, you know, I have to admit, so I have actually kind of long history with guitar synthesizers. Okay. Go ahead. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Cool. Back when, back when the, Roland GR 301st came out Yeah. I was one of the first people in the country that had the opportunity to get one, and I was doing, I was doing like studio work down in Dallas. And, so it seemed like it had the opportunity to pay for itself. And it was my first opportunity to see, to see how different it was. And so the <span style="color:red" data-ts="504.945" data-end_ts="505.165" title="504.945" id=c_"504.945">__gr__</span> the GR 300 series had, first of all, it had a hex distortion, which as he suggests is a completely different sound. You know, chords don't break up. You actually can hear the individual notes of the chords. Sometimes that's good. Sometimes it sounds completely not right. But it was kind of interesting. And then also it had this very simple synth engine that was really good for like screaming elephant tones and, you know, not much, not much else. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. But at least it was unique and it was interesting, Uhhuh <affirmative>. And then I, I continued playing around with it for a while, and then I moved, then I moved on, and maybe a decade later, a friend of mine picked up a Roland Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> gr something. It was one of the little units, the foot units, and it was now the standardized <span style="color:red" data-ts="558.035" data-end_ts="558.325" title="558.035" id=c_"558.035">__roll__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="558.325" data-end_ts="558.525" title="558.325" id=c_"558.325">__and__</span> pickup. And I was like, oh, I can't wait to hear what kind of sounds that they, that they, you know, are making, you know, they probably tuned some stuff great for guitar. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I put it on and it was like they took a general MIDI module and just like squirted the acoustic piano and the electric piano and Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> it was surprising because it was as if the voicing of the instrumentation didn't seem to match the instrument that was in your hand. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b>Right? Yeah. It's a kind of a shallow interpretation of former acoustic <laugh>. Right. You might phrase it, but I mean, I should preface what I'm about to say by saying I really, value, the synthesis of, different instruments. And I, and I not only incorporate that into my teaching, but it's something I, I actually have a great interest in. But, my, my issue with all <span style="color:red" data-ts="616.845" data-end_ts="616.965" title="616.845" id=c_"616.845">__this__</span>, the types, like the GR series, products is that, you know, they, they, they don't sound particularly great and, you know, you, you've got a guitar at your disposal. And to me, I find like using that kind of raw audio source much more interesting than using it as, you know, triggers for samples 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b>Or for synthesis. I mean, I, it's just, that's, that's where I'm at with that. And, you know, if I want my guitar to sign like <span style="color:red" data-ts="645.165" data-end_ts="645.285" title="645.165" id=c_"645.165">__a__</span>, a drum kit, I'll just go and learn a drum kit 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Or whatever, or find a, or find a tool that at least interfaces with a drum kit in a drum <span style="color:red" data-ts="653.805" data-end_ts="654.085" title="653.805" id=c_"653.805">__like__</span> way. You know, I felt like the technique that you used to play guitar was not very well oriented towards playing a cello section. You know, it just didn't seem to match up. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b>Yeah. So, yeah. No, and that's a good point too. I mean, it's a mismatch of essentially instrumental practices. And, while it's interesting, you know, I think that my argument has always been that there's just so much more to that kind of technology. There's so much more that could be done with it, you know, if we just think differently about it. Right. You know, the, the, the, the commercial approach is very interesting. But at the same time, you know, Gibson once joked with their, multi-channel guitars that they launched, including, was the HD six X or something like that, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="699.885" data-end_ts="700.085" title="699.885" id=c_"699.885">__the__</span>, the Tiger <span style="color:red" data-ts="701.065" data-end_ts="701.285" title="701.065" id=c_"701.065">__and__</span> D right? Yeah. Us Tiger. I think <span style="color:red" data-ts="703.565" data-end_ts="703.725" title="703.565" id=c_"703.565">__who__</span> was the, the model that they released a while back, you know, they joked <span style="color:red" data-ts="706.605" data-end_ts="706.725" title="706.605" id=c_"706.605">__that__</span>, oh, you can jack in all your strings like six Marshall stacks. That will sound awesome. You know, they're joking, they're, you know, they're joking, they're, they're being facetious. But at the same time, I mean, that kind of multi-channel application, particularly in experimental music and electronic music, is actually pretty fascinating. And this idea that you can immerse an audience and, essentially the, the, the registers of your instrument is, you know, something I'm, I'm still on board with after years of doing it. So. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I, I was gonna say, one of the things I noticed from your blog and from kind of the list of works that you do, that you are kind of into the massive multichannel thing, as well as sort of dipping a toe into Ambusonics as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b>Yes. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What, tell me a little bit. So that's some, that's a kind of work I've never done, I've never interacted with, high, high channel count surround. Yeah. And tell me what it is that you like about it, and what, what, I mean, is it an intellectual exercise <span style="color:red" data-ts="768.945" data-end_ts="769.165" title="768.945" id=c_"768.945">__of__</span> a way to finding, finding a way to make that interesting? Or sonically does it do something specific for you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b>I mean, arguably it's probably a little bit of both. Okay. But, I would say the latter more so than the intellectual exercise. <span style="color:red" data-ts="783.605" data-end_ts="783.725" title="783.605" id=c_"783.605">__I__</span>, I, you know, I think when I was a PhD student, there was a little bit of, you know, how do I take, an instrument, electric guitar practice further? And, you know, I, I delved into a lot of, theory that was really very abstract. And as a result, you know, you know, kind of, kind of alienating almost, and I won't bore you with those details. You know, the thesis is readily available if you need some, bad time reading to, you know, <laugh> good cure for the insomniac probably. But, but, but honestly, I mean, the multi-channel, side of things is, is incredibly fascinating to me, especially in the US at the minute where you have venues like, the Cube at Virginia Tech with, you know, 128 <span style="color:red" data-ts="830.515" data-end_ts="830.805" title="830.515" id=c_"830.515">__plus__</span> slide speakers. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And the fact, you know, this kind of system where you, you know, you can jack out all, all your registers, you can, you mentioned avionics, which is the specialization technique that I typically use. You can decode to all kinds of different array configurations, which is really wonderful. So I even use it when I play like, you know, regular kind of stereo or quad, venues. So if I go and do the stereo gig in, in, <span style="color:red" data-ts="858.585" data-end_ts="858.805" title="858.585" id=c_"858.585">__in__</span> New York, you know, you can decode the stereo immediately click <span style="color:red" data-ts="862.805" data-end_ts="862.885" title="862.805" id=c_"862.805">__of__</span> a button. You know, it's, so, it's a convenience thing more so than anything. But actually the math behind Ambusonics is also really fascinating too, because it's just basic trigonometry than then coefficients for the decoders Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So, you know, where your speakers are positioned, you can decode to the, that layout, which is pretty cool <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b>So, for me it's, it's, it's a developing aesthetic. You mentioned ambient music. It kind of goes hand in <span style="color:red" data-ts="886.685" data-end_ts="886.805" title="886.685" id=c_"886.685">__hand__</span> with that. I think, it's immersive. It allows you to, I think it was a way for me to kind of break out of kind of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data">PD</a> patches that I use, <span style="color:red" data-ts="895.465" data-end_ts="895.685" title="895.465" id=c_"895.465">__the__</span> or, or the max patches that I'm using for performance. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="899.085" data-end_ts="899.205" title="899.085" id=c_"899.085">__to__</span> try and make that a little bit more real, kind of, you know, I'm kind of performing in this data rich environment. I guess I'm taking all this data from the guitar and I'm trying to make it manifest in a performance space. It's kind of hard to do that in stereo. So the fact that you have multiple <span style="color:red" data-ts="913.525" data-end_ts="913.805" title="913.525" id=c_"913.525">__light__</span> speakers available to you, to me, it helps that process of trying to bring it out into the real world. Again, I, out of this weird abstract intellectual exercise that you mentioned before, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So now I'm curious, one of the things I like delving into in, in my podcast is people's backgrounds and how they get, how they got to be the artists that they are. Yeah, sure. I'm kind of curious about you because, again, in looking in a little bit of your bio, you're originally from Northern Ireland, right? That's right. Yeah. Yeah. And, and you find yourself in New Jersey, <laugh>. That alone sounds like a story. Additionally being a guitarist, but doing this, I mean, I hate to call it just ambient music because it's really more of a, there, there needs to be a name for something where there's music with really complex tamr, and where tamr generation and manipulation is, is important. Yeah. We kind of tend to lump that under ambient, but, but your stuff tends to belie that because sometimes there's a lot of movement, sometimes there's a little bit of aggression, you know? Yeah. And so it's a little bit more than your <span style="color:red" data-ts="981.815" data-end_ts="982.165" title="981.815" id=c_"981.815">__stock__</span> ambient music kind of thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b>Well, I appreciate that. Thank you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But, and I, and I really love it. I'll say that as well. But I'm curious to, to know where, where you come from, what your background was, and how you got to where you are. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="997.025" data-end_ts="997.245" title="997.025" id=c_"997.025">__Oh__</span>, sure. Good, good question. I grew up, in a little town near Belfast, in Northern Ireland. And that's the only time in the interview that you'll hear my accent really come out <laugh>. But <laugh>, yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1012.345" data-end_ts="1012.565" title="1012.345" id=c_"1012.345">__Let__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1012.565" data-end_ts="1012.645" title="1012.565" id=c_"1012.565">__me__</span> see. Well, I grew up with music. I couldn't escape it, really, because of my parents. You know, my, my father is a traditional Irish musician. He plays Nando Cello, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1020.115" data-end_ts="1020.405" title="1020.115" id=c_"1020.115">__Matt__</span>, which is Nando. It's like a eight string guitar sized man mandolin. Right. And he would play in a lot of fashion, like session music. And, he would do a lot of, you know, freelance studio recording, that kind of thing. So I was always run by that kind of music. My mother was kind of Irish <span style="color:red" data-ts="1037.025" data-end_ts="1037.245" title="1037.025" id=c_"1037.025">__set__</span> dancing, and so I was very much immersed in the Irish traditional arts, which I think, you know, played a big part in the kind of lyricism and, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1044.905" data-end_ts="1045.125" title="1044.905" id=c_"1044.905">__and__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1045.225" data-end_ts="1045.445" title="1045.225" id=c_"1045.225">__and__</span> my playing today, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1047.285" data-end_ts="1047.445" title="1047.285" id=c_"1047.285">__how__</span> always have that kind of a little <span style="color:red" data-ts="1048.585" data-end_ts="1048.805" title="1048.585" id=c_"1048.585">__to__</span>, I suppose, Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b><affirmative>, you know, the guitar, there was always guitars around in, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1052.785" data-end_ts="1053.005" title="1052.785" id=c_"1052.785">__in__</span>, in the highest growing up as a result, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1055.435" data-end_ts="1055.725" title="1055.435" id=c_"1055.435">__when__</span> all the kinds of instruments, pianos, violin. So I was always surrounded by music in some degree. And the guitar was always appealing because, you know, my, my parents' musical interests always extended beyond Irish traditional music into rock music. And, you know, so my dad was a big cream fan, and, you know, my mom loved Led Zeppelin, thin, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1072.845" data-end_ts="1073.205" title="1072.845" id=c_"1072.845">__Lizzie__</span>, ac, CDC, all that kind stuff. So I grew up with all that kind of stuff as well. So it was a no-brainer, really. I mean, that's just the instrument I was drawn to. And you mentioned before how my current music, like has, you know, kind of shifts between kind of maybe more gentle tams and more aggressive tams. And I think that that's another reason why I kind of picked a guitar was because you can get so much out of it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b>I mean, it's such an imperfect instrument as well. So it, it's a real challenge to kind of overcome the, the design of the instrument and become proficient <span style="color:red" data-ts="1104.385" data-end_ts="1104.605" title="1104.385" id=c_"1104.385">__at__</span> applying it. So I, I liked that challenge when I was younger as well. I loved to lock myself away and just <span style="color:red" data-ts="1109.085" data-end_ts="1109.325" title="1109.085" id=c_"1109.085">__wood__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1109.325" data-end_ts="1109.565" title="1109.325" id=c_"1109.325">__share__</span> for hours. I mean, that was, that was it. You know, I just really loved practicing the instrument too. And you can get so many, you know, gentle <span style="color:red" data-ts="1116.765" data-end_ts="1117.045" title="1116.765" id=c_"1116.765">__songs__</span> out of it. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1117.405" data-end_ts="1117.525" title="1117.405" id=c_"1117.405">__You__</span> can get so many aggressive songs out of it. And that's, that's kind of how I ended up with that instrument. But prior to that, I played, you know, violin and piano and things like that. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I've studied music at, at grammar school. You know, that was my thing that definitely that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1132.285" data-end_ts="1132.445" title="1132.285" id=c_"1132.285">__in__</span> sports <span style="color:red" data-ts="1133.005" data-end_ts="1133.245" title="1133.005" id=c_"1133.005">__mean__</span>, I play rugby, believe it or not. And then it was a choice between breaking my hands or, you know, <laugh> preserving them to play music. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1140.345" data-end_ts="1140.565" title="1140.345" id=c_"1140.345">__It__</span>, it's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Funny, I'm actually here in la I'm, I, I'm staying with my friend Andrew, who grew up in New Zealand, where they're Oh, nice. Insane about rugby as well. And he's, he was a clarinet player. Okay. And had a similar decision to make when he was in middle school. You know, basically, do I want my hands to work or do I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1161.205" data-end_ts="1161.325" title="1161.205" id=c_"1161.205">__wanna__</span> play rugby <laugh>? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b>Yeah. Yeah, that's it. I mean, it's a serious decision too. 'cause I mean, pretty much like, once you, I think once you're hitting the age of around, 18 years old, I mean, everyone's bigger as <span style="color:red" data-ts="1175.605" data-end_ts="1175.725" title="1175.605" id=c_"1175.605">__a__</span>, it's a more aggressive game and Right. Yeah. And I was getting to that stage, so I'm, I'm glad I made the decision that I made, you know, <laugh>. Yeah. And of course the, the New Zealanders are, prolific and the old rugby. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>They're, they're, yeah. But yeah, I mean, it's probably in the end, there's probably a longer career in getting your PhD than there, there would be, playing rugby <span style="color:red" data-ts="1199.105" data-end_ts="1199.325" title="1199.105" id=c_"1199.105">__as__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1199.505" data-end_ts="1199.725" title="1199.505" id=c_"1199.505">__now__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b>I dunno, rugby might be better paid 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1202.285" data-end_ts="1202.325" title="1202.285" id=c_"1202.285">__<laugh>__</span>. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b>Sorry. Did I say that? Yeah, I did <laugh>. But anyway, what else? Yeah, I, you know, aside from, you know, being surrounded by music at home, I studied it at school. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1213.325" data-end_ts="1213.445" title="1213.325" id=c_"1213.325">__I__</span> went on the university, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1214.525" data-end_ts="1214.645" title="1214.525" id=c_"1214.525">__I__</span>, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1214.845" data-end_ts="1214.925" title="1214.845" id=c_"1214.845">__would__</span>, did my undergraduate at Queen's University in Belfast at the, it's also referred to as the Sonic Arts Research Center, which they have there. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, in, in Belfast. And I was kind of fortunate enough to be there before and after that opened. So I got to experience both worlds pre and post sarc as, as it were, right at the undergraduate level. And then I went on to study that was music technology specifically. So that was during that time I was kind of exposed to, you know, electroacoustic music and Max MSP, super Collider, things like that. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And of course, at the time I was like, I'm never ever going to have any use for any of this stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b><laugh>, I just wanna record in studios. Right. I just wanted to play guitar. That's all I wanted to do. I wanted to play in bands and work in the studio. That <span style="color:red" data-ts="1259.285" data-end_ts="1259.365" title="1259.285" id=c_"1259.285">__was__</span>, that was it. And of course, you know, I, I couldn't have been more wrong, basically. Right. But, so I, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1263.965" data-end_ts="1264.205" title="1263.965" id=c_"1263.965">__it's__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1264.205" data-end_ts="1264.245" title="1264.205" id=c_"1264.205">__why__</span> I owe a lot to, to Queens University in that respect. And then I went to ster. I, I was very fortunate to, to gain a scholarship to, you know, that did do a master's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1275.125" data-end_ts="1275.205" title="1275.125" id=c_"1275.125">__and__</span> a PhD there. And during which time I kind of, well, the master's itself focused on music performance. So, everything from, rock metal and jazz, you know, pretty much, it was really a focus on the electric, which was really good. And then the PhD <span style="color:red" data-ts="1292.585" data-end_ts="1293.005" title="1292.585" id=c_"1292.585">__sought__</span> to, you know, combine the undergraduate and master's degree. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b>So it was kind of like, okay, you know, you've got certain abilities on an instrument, how do you make that fit within electronic and experimental music? 'cause I was always drawn to the idea of, well, I love all these wonderful production techniques. Can I do this in real time? Right. And then the challenge of the, the age old question, which, you know, conferences like nine, attempt the answer. You know, how do you, how do you do that in real time convincingly? How do you do that? Especially given that both your hands are busy and started to build live performance systems. And I, you know, I chose <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data">PD</a> initially, having the prior experience with Max, but not having the money to buy Max. So <laugh>, but, you know, the woes of the, the PhD student, I suppose. Right. <laugh>. But yeah, so I, I, I got into that way, and then I mentioned before I went to Stein in Amsterdam, and, and those guys really pushed me on it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b>They said, okay, well if you're gonna do this, you, you know, you gotta, you gotta program. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1356.385" data-end_ts="1356.605" title="1356.385" id=c_"1356.385">__You__</span> know, my initial response was, well, can't you guys do that? And <laugh>, you know, I'll, I'll just, I'll just play, you know, you guys have built, you know, they had Lisa and all kinds of really cool software. I was like, sure, I can just use that. And they're like, well, look, do you want a more intimate understanding? You know, it's worth doing it, you know, they gently <span style="color:red" data-ts="1373.115" data-end_ts="1373.405" title="1373.115" id=c_"1373.115">__kind__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1373.405" data-end_ts="1373.525" title="1373.405" id=c_"1373.405">__of__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1373.545" data-end_ts="1373.765" title="1373.545" id=c_"1373.545">__for__</span> European Way, push me on it a little bit. And, I went back as an artist in residence in 2010 and, you know, really, brushed up on my, and got my programming chops up. I haven't really looked back since. Now I will say that that really had a kind of a detrimental, impact initially on my playing, because I ended up programming more than I was playing. But in a way, what's interesting to me, is that the, the software and hardware side is very much a part of the practice. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1406.285" data-end_ts="1406.485" title="1406.285" id=c_"1406.285">__Now__</span>, when I go into the practice room, I have my laptop set up, and then when I'm playing, I'm thinking about, well, okay, this is what the guitar sounds like. That's a guitar. What might I program to make it sound like I want it to, you know? So it's, it's, it's very much a part of, it's integrated into the practice at this point, which is cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Couple of details about how you do your work. Okay. Good. First of all, what, what is your primary guitar? What is the primary instrument that you play? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b>Yeah, good question. I am currently playing a seven string guitar. And it's fitted with a, what I would refer to as a multi-channel pickup, but it's essentially a, a MIDI pickup designed by Graph <span style="color:red" data-ts="1448.525" data-end_ts="1448.805" title="1448.525" id=c_"1448.525">__Tech__</span>, which is a Canadian company. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1451.315" data-end_ts="1451.605" title="1451.315" id=c_"1451.315">__Paso__</span> Electric. It has the regular kind of 13 pinned in output. And I jacked that out into my aforementioned Sept system, which I worked on <span style="color:red" data-ts="1460.205" data-end_ts="1460.485" title="1460.205" id=c_"1460.205">__with__</span> Joan Harding. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So they actually, they make a pickup for seven string. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b>Yeah. Well, actually, well, yeah. I mean, the, the deal there is that, you know, traditionally the standard is one to six for a six string, and then the seventh pin on the din connectors for like a mono <span style="color:red" data-ts="1476.955" data-end_ts="1477.245" title="1476.955" id=c_"1476.955">__feed__</span> or a mono <span style="color:red" data-ts="1477.705" data-end_ts="1477.925" title="1477.705" id=c_"1477.705">__sum__</span> of the, of the six individual pickups. See? Right, right, right. So, I, I just, <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Just tagged it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b>I, I, I just use it for the seventh string, basically. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Got it. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b>So it's, it, it works out pretty well for me, and I just do filtering any kinda filtering and, and software. But I am really excited now because I, I bought my first eight string guitar last year, and, a guy called Joel Guzman, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1502.005" data-end_ts="1502.205" title="1502.005" id=c_"1502.005">__he__</span> runs a company called SCI-Fi Research, produced a wonderful set of, modular, pickups, called the News and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1512.385" data-end_ts="1512.605" title="1512.385" id=c_"1512.385">__Nu__</span> and he sending me some post NAMM this year. Okay. So I'm gonna install those and I might change up the connector scenario a little bit. You can get those really nice limo connectors. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1526.525" data-end_ts="1526.965" title="1526.525" id=c_"1526.525">__Alright__</span>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1526.965" data-end_ts="1527.325" title="1526.965" id=c_"1526.965">__That's__</span> been suggested. So got of 20 plus Pin, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What's the name of the company that does these pickups? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b>Sci-Fi. That's, C-Y-C-F-I. Oh, okay. Research. Got it. Basically, it's a, it's a hub for all <span style="color:red" data-ts="1540.205" data-end_ts="1540.365" title="1540.205" id=c_"1540.205">__the__</span>, you know, for the multi-channel guitarists or Right. Or, you know, that are kind of working with these like, you know, divided pickup ideas. Right. And that also includes Matthieu <span style="color:red" data-ts="1549.545" data-end_ts="1549.765" title="1549.545" id=c_"1549.545">__gr__</span> and, he's behind the, gives <span style="color:red" data-ts="1552.285" data-end_ts="1552.485" title="1552.285" id=c_"1552.285">__an__</span> plex and Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you, you know, he's been working in that kind of vein for a long time too. So a lot of really interesting guys. You know, just being part of that community as well. It's, it's seemingly growing and growing is Right. Pretty, it's, it's educational. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's cool. It's, it's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b>Really, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So you, you take, you tap this out with the Ssar, what are you feeding it into? You mentioned a lot of things so far. You mentioned working with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data">PD</a> and Max and Super cder, but also Ableton Live. What is, what is sort of like the end route on this stuff? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b>That's cool. That's a good question. I mean, I primarily, pipe it into pd. So it really, the way I kind of organize the musical materials is in two worlds or two frames if you, if you will. So I, I still use like, my regular kind of magnetic pickups. So I have a regular kind of mono feed from the guitar concurrently. So when I would perform, it would be, I kind of contain all the guitar <span style="color:red" data-ts="1612.255" data-end_ts="1612.605" title="1612.255" id=c_"1612.255">__stick__</span> kind of materials to this stage. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know, I'm still <span style="color:red" data-ts="1614.605" data-end_ts="1614.725" title="1614.605" id=c_"1614.605">__playing__</span> through an amplifier Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, still using pedals. So I have this immediate, really tightly coupled relationship between, you know, what looks like a regular guitar and amplifier. So I'm still doing guitar type stuff that people recognize. And then the divided pickup stuff, I pipe out into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data">PD</a> and it goes out into a multichannel race <span style="color:red" data-ts="1634.345" data-end_ts="1634.565" title="1634.345" id=c_"1634.345">__run__</span> in the audience. There's kind of like two frames. Gotcha. You can imagine it. There <span style="color:red" data-ts="1639.565" data-end_ts="1639.645" title="1639.565" id=c_"1639.565">__are__</span>, there are some stuff, some, some posts and whatnot on my website that kind of go through this idea. So yeah, mainly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data">PD</a> And, you know, I, I, I still use Ableton for, for the kind of the mono feeds, as well, you know, for like looping live, if I don't want to, you know, drag pedals around with me, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1656.205" data-end_ts="1656.325" title="1656.205" id=c_"1656.205">__I__</span> ableton's embedded in my practice as well. It's where I started. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b>You know, I, I do some training for Ableton as well. I did the whole certification 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b>A while back. So, and I teach it, I teach it at Stevens too. You know, students really like it when they come in as freshmen. I mean, that's, it tends to be their, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1675.655" data-end_ts="1676.005" title="1675.655" id=c_"1675.655">__their__</span> do choice. Which is interesting, I think, especially for being in the, New York metro area, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b>Where, you know, most studios are still pro tools. Right. But anyway, I mean, yeah. So long story short, still mainly using pd. I mean, it's just such a, in my opinion, an easy to use, programming environment. Right. And in some cases, if I'm involved in certain projects, I might use Max as an alternative. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, the similarities are still pretty, pretty good, so, right. It's an easy transition. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, indeed. So, now I'm gonna talk a little bit more about some specifics with being a guitarist. You mentioned before something that I, that drives me nuts when I try to do <span style="color:red" data-ts="1720.885" data-end_ts="1720.965" title="1720.885" id=c_"1720.885">__LEC__</span> electronic guitar work, but also other performers whose hands are full. My friend Andrew, the, clarinettist slash saxophonist, my friend Jane, who's a flutist, all of us have the same problem, which two hands are occupied. And all of this software is really oriented towards, towards most movements as a primary way of interacting with the software. Now you can do some things with foot pedals, like the soft staff or whatever Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> to mitigate some of that. But at some point, the complexity of managing the pedals overwhelms the <laugh>, the value of what you're trying to control. <laugh>, how do you handle that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b>Yeah. I mentioned before, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1765.745" data-end_ts="1765.965" title="1765.745" id=c_"1765.745">__but__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1765.965" data-end_ts="1766.165" title="1765.965" id=c_"1765.965">__take__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1766.165" data-end_ts="1766.405" title="1766.165" id=c_"1766.165">__data__</span> from the guitar. So I'm, I'm tracking a whole bunch of stuff and, and my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data">PD</a> patches, including Pitch and Amplitude, and I'm, I'm organizing, pitch data into kind of like higher abstractions that that deal with, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1779.585" data-end_ts="1780.005" title="1779.585" id=c_"1779.585">__tunnel__</span> ideas, so like pitch class sets and things like that. Which also, again, like an intellectual exercise, but my argument is that, you know, a lot of this data, can be used as control data. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So as I'm playing, you know, if you can imagine a lot of this, incoming data is, is stored in like a 2D array. Right. Those arrays can be used to, you know, effectively envelopes to control DSP. So, you know, as I'm playing certain, certain melodies, there's a continuous readout there that, his maps say to, the angle of how your system is panning your string. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b>Right, okay. For example. So that, that's a really kind of, primitive mapping. But, that's kind of where I started. And, other, other projects I've looked at, say tracking the body as well. So this is bringing in a new idea. So, you know, these <span style="color:red" data-ts="1833.045" data-end_ts="1833.165" title="1833.045" id=c_"1833.045">__of__</span> the connect the track, the, you know, various points in the body and the instrument, and using say, you know, philosophy, acceleration data that to control how, signs are panned around a space as well. Sure. So whether it's direction or how quickly, they're panned around, that's kind of like, you know, some of the basic mappings that have come out of, sort of earlier tasks. So yeah. Just trying to, it's really good. It's a good problem. And that's hard to overcome that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Have you ever tried, have you ever tried doing things like trying to determine what register or what, what position on the neck you're playing based on like what notes are coming out of which pickup or whatever? Have you ever had Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1879.005" data-end_ts="1879.245" title="1879.005" id=c_"1879.005">__Little__</span> bit tried doing that kind of stuff? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b>Yeah, a little bit. I mean, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1882.545" data-end_ts="1882.765" title="1882.545" id=c_"1882.545">__the__</span> detecting what string you're playing is easy enough. I mean, you know, when you've got that divided pickup situation <span style="color:red" data-ts="1888.745" data-end_ts="1888.965" title="1888.745" id=c_"1888.745">__on__</span>, you know, ongoing, it's, it's pretty simple. It's basic amplitude thresholding. Right. But, playing, you know, determining where you play in the neck, you know, at one point I had to stop myself and think, well, why do I really care about this <laugh>? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. <laugh>, you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b>Know, you know, you know, because at the moment <span style="color:red" data-ts="1905.985" data-end_ts="1906.205" title="1905.985" id=c_"1905.985">__you__</span>, you can become really immersed in a problem like that, and then <span style="color:red" data-ts="1909.615" data-end_ts="1909.965" title="1909.615" id=c_"1909.615">__least__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1909.965" data-end_ts="1910.245" title="1909.965" id=c_"1909.965">__sight__</span> of actually playing your instrument. Right. You know, and at one point, you know, I was really pleased that I was able to, you know, track each register concurrently and be able to kind of, you know, compute these abstract tunnel structures in software. And I thought to myself, okay, so I have all these discreet values <span style="color:red" data-ts="1928.865" data-end_ts="1929.085" title="1928.865" id=c_"1928.865">__and__</span> I that, you know, it seemed kind of wonderful at the time, but then really what you've done is you've created a switch 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b>Right. You know, this discrete value that you're gonna map to something. So, I mean, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> Okay. Just like breaking down my whole, my whole, worldview of what, what you must be detecting by just pointing out that in a lot of the cases that by the time you reduce the data to be useful, it becomes so reductive that it's not particularly interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b>Well, I, you know, it's still interesting. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1963.245" data-end_ts="1963.365" title="1963.245" id=c_"1963.245">__I__</span>, you know, it's, it, yeah. Maybe <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b>Yeah. Yeah, it, you know, it's still interesting, you know, it's, it, it can be useful. I think my, my issue <span style="color:red" data-ts="1972.685" data-end_ts="1972.885" title="1972.685" id=c_"1972.685">__with__</span> it was that it was <span style="color:red" data-ts="1974.725" data-end_ts="1974.965" title="1974.725" id=c_"1974.725">__this__</span>, it became this, you know, after all <span style="color:red" data-ts="1977.085" data-end_ts="1977.245" title="1977.085" id=c_"1977.085">__out__</span> work, it became this discreet one-to-one mapping almost. So. Right. I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1981.205" data-end_ts="1981.245" title="1981.205" id=c_"1981.205">__have__</span> one instance where I, I would use the, you know, the, the pitch data to, to determine, the behaviors of, I'm sure you're familiar with the Boyd's algorithm and Yes. And Max and pd. Right. So I, I, I would use that to, to <span style="color:red" data-ts="1994.895" data-end_ts="1995.565" title="1994.895" id=c_"1994.895">__specialize__</span> strings around. And, you know, and I mentioned <span style="color:red" data-ts="1997.565" data-end_ts="1997.725" title="1997.565" id=c_"1997.565">__and__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1997.795" data-end_ts="1998.085" title="1997.795" id=c_"1997.795">__bats__</span>, and I always have to give and the props because anda really, you know, plugged me into this world. And he, he uses boys a lot with, there's, he's a piece called Flock, which uses like, cello, which is a really beautiful piece. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b>And he uses Boys and Max to, to create these really beautiful spatial gestures. My my idea was to take the, the pitch data from the guitar to determine how the Boyd flocked around. So if I was resolving to the tonic or, pitch class <span style="color:red" data-ts="2026.125" data-end_ts="2026.365" title="2026.125" id=c_"2026.125">__arrow__</span> or whatever in a, in a, in a set, then maybe the Boyds would flock to the center of the array if I was playing outside of the set. Maybe, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2033.665" data-end_ts="2033.885" title="2033.665" id=c_"2033.665">__if__</span> I was playing something that would say in a chromatic space, then mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, maybe they would flock to the periphery or to the, to the edge of the array. So things like that, I mean, and, and that was my way of kind of making it more continuous again, rather than these kind of discreet switches. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Because 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b>I remember German PhD, I talked to Craig Anderson about this, and he did say to me, Craig works at or does a lot of stuff for Gibson, is my under. And other folks I'm sure had mentioned that the moment you, you turn your guitar string into the switch, you're doomed. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2062.465" data-end_ts="2062.685" title="2062.465" id=c_"2062.465">__And__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2062.805" data-end_ts="2062.925" title="2062.805" id=c_"2062.805">__I__</span> think that he was kind of writing <span style="color:red" data-ts="2063.845" data-end_ts="2064.125" title="2063.845" id=c_"2063.845">__away__</span> because, you know, you, you spend a lot of time trying to make it something that it's not, and usually sight of what the guitar is. And it's very much a, in my opinion, a continuous, instrumental art form. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. One of the things that I know from working with the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2080.445" data-end_ts="2080.685" title="2080.445" id=c_"2080.445">__boys__</span> algorithm myself Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, is that you're, when you start working with it, you quickly have to disuse yourself of the idea of controlling them and instead start thinking in terms of influencing. Yeah. Right. And that actually really changes your head space when you're working on, when you're working on some sort of instrumental movement or compositional task. It's just a different, it's a different head space, and it's, I think it's kind of a useful way to be thinking about it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b>Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. It's a, it's, I I guess it's kind of that idea of, you know, do you want to be a manager of a musical system or do you actually wanna be a performer <laugh> Right. As well. Right. You know, no, you're totally right. I, I'd agree with that. And it does change your head space too. I mean, the whole process kind of smacks it being a little bit of a control freak too. It's like, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2134.485" data-end_ts="2134.645" title="2134.485" id=c_"2134.485">__wanna__</span> control every single iota of this system. But there's something nice about, and, and the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2141.605" data-end_ts="2141.765" title="2141.605" id=c_"2141.605">__boys__</span> algorithm's a good example. There's something really wonderful about that, you know, allowing the computer to, you know, have some say in, you know, some of the structures that emerge so 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well. I think also that there's a, there's a certain kind of a trek that people go through depending on what instrument they started with. I remember when <span style="color:red" data-ts="2158.905" data-end_ts="2159.125" title="2158.905" id=c_"2158.905">__Jan__</span> Hammer was, first coming onto the scene, so this is like ages and ages ago, but I read an interview with him and he basically said, you know, every keyboard player is trying to be a sloppy lead player, like a guitarist. And every guitarist is trying to be a control freak, like a keyboard player, <laugh>, you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b>Know? Yeah. Well, there might be some truth in that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I think there might be. And so the trick you go through, which is sort of like saying, I don't control very many parameters, so I would like to have more control. I think that that's kind of a natural part of the trek. And then you, you go through that only to find, find out what, at least for you, turns out to be the interesting things versus the not interesting things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So I'm curious now, you've, you've really blazed out some interesting paths for yourself. Where, where do you see yourself going next? What are the areas that kind of intrigue you now? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b>The creative output, interestingly, like just, focusing on actually performing and composing again. I've definitely gotten to a point where, those technical skills, particularly the programming side, are kind of on autopilot. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So, like I've started into a bit of like external development for pd. You know, so not <span style="color:red" data-ts="2240.785" data-end_ts="2241.005" title="2240.785" id=c_"2240.785">__on__</span>, not only dealing in kind of abstractions and that stuff tends to happen of its own accord now, but where I'm really focusing my energy is, actually on, you know, getting back in the practice room, performing and performing, playing, playing shows. And, I'm working on some new music now, which is a relief 'cause it's been a while. You know, I, I, like you mentioned earlier, I've moved from, northern island to, to New Jersey, which is, was, was quite a transition. And, you know, that took a lot of time to kind of adjust culturally and whatnot, to a very different place, where I didn't really have the same kind of network. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b>And so it's taken a number of years to kind of really build up a network again Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, and to get out into a scene and actually start playing again. And conferences like Seamus and, and, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2289.915" data-end_ts="2290.205" title="2289.915" id=c_"2289.915">__Nime__</span> and, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2290.545" data-end_ts="2290.765" title="2290.545" id=c_"2290.545">__and__</span> have been great from, from a professional standpoint. And, that really got me going again. So I'll be playing a show in February, at Seamus, done at, Georgia Southern University in Statesboro. So that, that'll be fun. That'll be another, another show. I'm working with, Peter <span style="color:red" data-ts="2312.445" data-end_ts="2312.605" title="2312.445" id=c_"2312.445">__ela__</span>, he's a percussionist <span style="color:red" data-ts="2313.825" data-end_ts="2314.045" title="2313.825" id=c_"2313.825">__and__</span> based in New Jersey, does a lot of, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2317.035" data-end_ts="2317.325" title="2317.035" id=c_"2317.035">__kind__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2317.325" data-end_ts="2317.445" title="2317.325" id=c_"2317.325">__of__</span> marimba and kit work. And, we've just started, so we're, we're not sure where that's going, but yeah, the focus right now is definitely to write some new music, and the focus on that versus the design of the stuff that facilitates it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That sounds great. Well, and, and it's, it's good to hear too. I, I have this tendency to just sort of like, get in the technical hole and never come out. And so it's good to see that you're introspective about making sure that you pull yourself out of programming world and, you know, Mm-Hmm. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2352.045" data-end_ts="2352.085" title="2352.045" id=c_"2352.045">__<affirmative>__</span>, push yourself back in a performing world as well. For people who wanna check out your work, where's the best place for them to, to hear it or read it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b>Yeah, sure. Ricky Grahamcom is my, I basically just run a blog style website, so if, if you're interested in the academic stuff that's on there. And the music's on there too, and, software and, the limited amount of hardware stuff is, is on the website as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. And they can get to your SoundCloud from there too, because that's, I spent a lot of time diving into your SoundCloud. There's some beautiful work there, so, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b>Oh, thank you very much. I appreciate that. Yeah, absolutely. It's all, it's all up there. It's, it's under, there's a category on the website, labeled sound sounds, so you can find <span style="color:red" data-ts="2398.405" data-end_ts="2398.525" title="2398.405" id=c_"2398.405">__it__</span> under there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright, cool. And, last but not least, something I always like to ask in people, when I get 'em cornered like this, is if you ran into the, the younger 16, 18-year-old version of yourself, what advice would you give you to make the path either easier or harder or just say, you know, get into car sales or something like that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b><laugh> and stick to rugby. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Stick to rugby. Your hands aren't that important. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b><laugh> No, in all seriousness, I mean, I probably would say, you know, I'm focused on practicing more <span style="color:red" data-ts="2437.235" data-end_ts="2437.525" title="2437.235" id=c_"2437.235">__sort__</span> of than the, than the tech side. I mean, I think that's, I, it's a small regret that I have so far is that I maybe spent too much time immersed in technical details and not enough actually creating music. So, that would be it probably, and not the hold back. You know, I have a horrible, tendency to, to be very reserved and conservative when I play in some instances. So, not something that I've since addressed, but yeah, that would be my advice to my younger self. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that's fantastic, Ricky, thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us and for, kind of filling us in not only your background, but some of your ideas about how, how this stuff works and, and Sure. You can open your <span style="color:red" data-ts="2483.085" data-end_ts="2483.165" title="2483.085" id=c_"2483.085">__head__</span>. I appreciate it, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b>Man. Yeah, no problem. Thank you very much, Darwin We really appreciate it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright, well if that, I'll say goodbye. Bye now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ricky: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2489.875" data-end_ts="2490.365" title="2489.875" id=c_"2489.875">__Alright__</span>, bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. I want to thank Ricky for, spending a little time with us. Talking about guitars. Makes me wanna get the guitar out of the closet. Of course that always happens when I talk to interesting people. So anyway, thanks Ricky for that. Thanks a lot to you for listening. Thanks to my friends out at opia and other online venues that are helping spread the word about the podcast. And I hope to hear from you soon. Thanks a lot and we'll catch you later.
