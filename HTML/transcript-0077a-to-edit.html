<b>Darwin: </b>Today's chat is with two of my favorite people in the world. It's Woody and <span style="color:red" data-ts="9.83" data-end_ts="10.07" title="9.83" id=c_"9.83">__Stain__</span> of Ulka. I first got to know them, through their interaction with <span style="color:red" data-ts="15.2" data-end_ts="15.55" title="15.2" id=c_"15.2">__Noyce__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="15.55" data-end_ts="15.75" title="15.55" id=c_"15.55">__Fold__</span>, which is David Stout and <span style="color:red" data-ts="17.03" data-end_ts="17.31" title="17.03" id=c_"17.03">__Corey__</span> Metcalf as part of their work. And they're pulling me in to see, their community. I got a chance to meet the SKAs who have an incredible history. So what I did was, at a recent workshop, series in Seattle, they happened to be there as part of a, part of a project. And so I kind of cornered them in their hotel room and got a chance to ask them about their history and about what makes them tick. Now, it, two issues. First of all, it's a very long interview. So what I've decided to do based on listener feedback is I'm actually going to be breaking this up into two parts. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The first part will post on Sunday, and the second part will post on Wednesday. That way it gets broken up a little bit and I get a little more time to do my editing work. So that's what we're going to, do with this one. The second thing is, unfortunately I had two recorders running for this. I had my trustee task cam and, my laptop as kind of a backup. Well, luckily for me, that backup, was good because my task cam, hand recorder just did not do its job yet. Again, not having a lot of fun with that thing right now. So, what you're hearing is the audio that was recorded by the laptop that was kind of sitting in between us all. But unfortunately, as you can imagine, laptop audio is not quite as good as we'd hoped for. So there's, the explanation for the audio quality, I apologize. But, what they have to say and what they have to share is so important. I felt like we needed to put this up. Anyway. So, with that, I offer you Woody and state of Alka. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Can you tell me a little bit about your background and how it's influenced your art? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody Vasulka: </b>See, my, my treasury is this. I I have to go really to the war again, right? And then I have to go through kind of, first the, even the occupation. See, when we were invited, invited by the Germans as the first step expansion to the East. 'cause they planned already that they're gonna conquer the Russia. You know, they, <span style="color:red" data-ts="164.91" data-end_ts="165.31" title="164.91" id=c_"164.91">__Hitler__</span> dream was so then they needed to check industry to produce material, airplanes, which they didn't trust the Bohemians. So they went to the Slovakia and made a deal with the Slovak <span style="color:red" data-ts="185.06" data-end_ts="185.28" title="185.06" id=c_"185.06">__as__</span> being liaisons and <span style="color:red" data-ts="186.92" data-end_ts="187.24" title="186.92" id=c_"186.92">__being__</span> friendly. And then they made all the production of the airplanes there. 'cause they were afraid that checks would, you know, booby <span style="color:red" data-ts="199.84" data-end_ts="200.08" title="199.84" id=c_"199.84">__trap__</span>, right? Sure. So, so it was clear. But then, but they let the, the checks do most of the huge, cans. See, they made <span style="color:red" data-ts="210.36" data-end_ts="210.6" title="210.36" id=c_"210.36">__this__</span> unbelievable cans that <span style="color:red" data-ts="212.82" data-end_ts="213.04" title="212.82" id=c_"212.82">__it__</span> let them put on, you know, when they expected the American invasion and they actually killed some Americans and airplanes and also ships. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>They, so in the <span style="color:red" data-ts="227.76" data-end_ts="228" title="227.76" id=c_"227.76">__checks__</span> kind of <span style="color:red" data-ts="229.31" data-end_ts="229.6" title="229.31" id=c_"229.31">__were__</span> guilty because they <span style="color:red" data-ts="231.76" data-end_ts="231.88" title="231.76" id=c_"231.76">__produced__</span> that very well, and it all worked, and they were scared not to produce well. So airplane, it just disappears and nobody knows why they crushed the shot or not. So this kind of ambiguity was clear. I will learn that a little bit further after the events as kids too young to actually understand it during the process. But as soon as the, the Germans first went all the way there, you know, into Russia, but then they get beaten back <span style="color:red" data-ts="270.78" data-end_ts="271" title="270.78" id=c_"270.78">__and__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="271" data-end_ts="271.24" title="271" id=c_"271">__then__</span> was clear was kind of <span style="color:red" data-ts="272.88" data-end_ts="272.96" title="272.88" id=c_"272.88">__a__</span> place for the maturity of understanding this political game. My father, of course, worked for the company that produced <span style="color:red" data-ts="282.61" data-end_ts="282.96" title="282.61" id=c_"282.61">__light__</span> weapons and also gave it to the <span style="color:red" data-ts="287.2" data-end_ts="287.48" title="287.2" id=c_"287.2">__<inaudible>__</span> for the Nazi, right. Military. And, but as I say, we were not brutalized except the Jews living there and the gypsies. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>They were taken as the same into these places, and they <span style="color:red" data-ts="304.45" data-end_ts="304.8" title="304.45" id=c_"304.45">__tried__</span> to eradicate them, you know, and but then the whole idea about <span style="color:red" data-ts="310.5" data-end_ts="310.72" title="310.5" id=c_"310.5">__the__</span> who, actually Hitler was somehow mysterious because we checked, look at them as total idiots. But the Americans, I mean, the, the, the, the, the, the Germans took him as a serious person that would kind of totally eradicate, something called, you know, the unemployment and, you know, all the suffering of that past. And he came, he made the nation dynamic, and he gave them ideology. And they were sort of stupid enough to accept it, which was very puzzling to the <span style="color:red" data-ts="355.24" data-end_ts="355.52" title="355.24" id=c_"355.24">__checks__</span>, because checks are so doubted, doubtful. And so, but it, I didn't feel that we were, sort of completely, ed or, you know, that they wanted to erase us because we were good workers. You know, my father was a secret communist because he came from the Russia, <span style="color:red" data-ts="382.42" data-end_ts="382.64" title="382.42" id=c_"382.42">__it__</span> was number of the first war, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>Mm-hmm. <affirmative> military. And then he caught that kind of socialism of communism there. And then, so, but he was very quiet during that war. There was no communist party that would be visible. And so the guys were working and make all the materials for the Nazis, which later I was actually quite upset about it because the Czechs <span style="color:red" data-ts="414.3" data-end_ts="414.72" title="414.3" id=c_"414.3">__helped__</span> the German <span style="color:red" data-ts="418.56" data-end_ts="418.96" title="418.56" id=c_"418.56">__<inaudible>__</span> function. And, that was, but then of course, it's clear and we were forgiven by everybody. And then we were slight communists there, and we had <span style="color:red" data-ts="431.84" data-end_ts="431.96" title="431.84" id=c_"431.84">__a__</span> socialism and so forth. But it was the beginning. But I was lucky to catch my friends. And my, our friends were some couple of them older. And they went all the way to the <span style="color:red" data-ts="446.8" data-end_ts="447.36" title="446.8" id=c_"446.8">__decadent__</span> part of the French, you know, the French. And about, you know, in the middle of the previous century, you know, there was this period when there was this sort of strange, this, you know, people like, let's <span style="color:red" data-ts="466.44" data-end_ts="466.52" title="466.44" id=c_"466.44">__say__</span>, let me, try to remember names. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>But, who were the poets of that time that were decadent in France? You have Chenko? What? You have Chenko? No, no. This is Russia. No, no. We are talking now about France. Oh, yeah. Rebo. <span style="color:red" data-ts="485.64" data-end_ts="485.96" title="485.64" id=c_"485.64">__<inaudible>__</span>. Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="487.08" data-end_ts="487.36" title="487.08" id=c_"487.08">__<inaudible>__</span>. And that group, <span style="color:red" data-ts="489.64" data-end_ts="489.92" title="489.64" id=c_"489.64">__over__</span> least five or six. <span style="color:red" data-ts="491.55" data-end_ts="491.84" title="491.55" id=c_"491.55">__Just__</span> a real decadent, and, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="495.69" data-end_ts="496.04" title="495.69" id=c_"495.69">__Rambo__</span>, you know, was a kid and all kind of stuff that was so perverted. Also a lot of sexuality there between them, you know? And so, so that was the first time when we were taken from the Czech. Okay. More or <span style="color:red" data-ts="513.84" data-end_ts="514.04" title="513.84" id=c_"513.84">__less__</span> moderate and sweet. And the, lyrical thing to a radical moment. And the radical moment had some impact on us to accept modernism in <span style="color:red" data-ts="529.84" data-end_ts="529.96" title="529.84" id=c_"529.84">__a__</span> extreme, because the modernism was in some kind of a perverted, you know, version of the traditional poetry of the Czech poetry, which was usually sweet and interesting, sometimes radical, but it never crossed in this sexuality, freedom of sexuality. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>And so for us, this was all open. And then of course, there was <span style="color:red" data-ts="560.43" data-end_ts="560.72" title="560.43" id=c_"560.43">__part__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="560.78" data-end_ts="561" title="560.78" id=c_"560.78">__the__</span> Russia, early Russia, which was, what was that guy again, you said? Yeah, <span style="color:red" data-ts="570.38" data-end_ts="570.6" title="570.38" id=c_"570.38">__ko__</span>. Yeah. Yeah. And that was later. But the guy that, grew up with Stalin, back in the, Stalin's <span style="color:red" data-ts="580.08" data-end_ts="580.2" title="580.08" id=c_"580.08">__name__</span>, how am <span style="color:red" data-ts="580.64" data-end_ts="580.72" title="580.64" id=c_"580.64">__I__</span>, you know, with, he was orient man, and the guy that was a poet, that was my favorite poet. Fuck. But anyway, this all came together and made right for us. When I started to be aware of that, when I was at the age probably of 17, we had a chess band in my hometown. We practice this kind of learning poetry of that period, you know, this decadent poetry. We had our own, theaters in the outside of the, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="627.32" data-end_ts="627.44" title="627.32" id=c_"627.32">__a__</span>, a city. We went to the hills and did all kind of interesting things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>There was some nudity, but, and no penetrations. So it was very free world. And, we were sort of left on the other hand, not the communist <span style="color:red" data-ts="647.96" data-end_ts="648.24" title="647.96" id=c_"647.96">__left__</span>, because he became slightly poverty into complete brutality. Right. So, but we were still left. There was no doubt. And, so, and in that situation, we practiced all kind of <span style="color:red" data-ts="663.72" data-end_ts="663.84" title="663.72" id=c_"663.72">__a__</span> format. We may have a jazz <span style="color:red" data-ts="666.51" data-end_ts="666.8" title="666.51" id=c_"666.51">__band__</span>, and it was a <span style="color:red" data-ts="669.2" data-end_ts="669.44" title="669.2" id=c_"669.2">__<inaudible>__</span>, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="669.98" data-end_ts="670.2" title="669.98" id=c_"669.98">__it__</span> was a station in Vienna called Blue <span style="color:red" data-ts="674.09" data-end_ts="674.44" title="674.09" id=c_"674.09">__DanUp__</span>. It was the military station. They were just, of course, occupying that. <span style="color:red" data-ts="678.66" data-end_ts="678.88" title="678.66" id=c_"678.66">__And__</span>, but there was a guy called <span style="color:red" data-ts="680.27" data-end_ts="680.76" title="680.27" id=c_"680.27">__Village__</span> Turnover. And, he was, had, we had this, what's called special language, special English, when he was using a limited amount of sort of vocabulary, but we could learn that after hearing it for five, 10 times. And then it was Jess and <span style="color:red" data-ts="704.87" data-end_ts="705.16" title="704.87" id=c_"704.87">__Jess__</span> and <span style="color:red" data-ts="706.23" data-end_ts="706.52" title="706.23" id=c_"706.23">__Beba__</span> and all these contemporary new, you know. But did you know 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina Vasulka: </b>Then that you were artist? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>That he was what? That 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>You were artist 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>That's, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I was curious about the same thing, because to a certain extent, I, I'm not sure that when you're 17 and you're playing music, and you're listening to music, and you're running around with your friends and you're experimenting with sexuality, is that just being young or is that the, or is that being, becoming an artist? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>I did the, my major entrance to like <span style="color:red" data-ts="746.18" data-end_ts="746.3" title="746.18" id=c_"746.18">__a__</span> cartoon. Art was a poetry. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And I, I still, with me and my consciousness, the poetry is the most supreme form because it's the most abstract. You know, once you go into prose and you <span style="color:red" data-ts="762.18" data-end_ts="762.3" title="762.18" id=c_"762.18">__have__</span> to lie, you have to talk about people that you don't know, you to invent people, you, you have no, no freedom. You have to model the world. And, you know, and that is eventually become imprisoned new. Especially when I kind <span style="color:red" data-ts="783.38" data-end_ts="783.46" title="783.38" id=c_"783.38">__of__</span> went through my little <span style="color:red" data-ts="784.89" data-end_ts="785.18" title="784.89" id=c_"784.89">__kind__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="785.24" data-end_ts="785.46" title="785.24" id=c_"785.24">__or__</span> not get little but serious, industrial post school, after my general, you know, school, I, I realized that, I have to leave this, this kind of a idea of, of reality as far as, technology. And, then I, the, the poetry was the only escape I had. And also to write prose, I eventually have to pick it up somewhere. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>And it was not no longer mine. See, so the poetry is only private, <span style="color:red" data-ts="829.3" data-end_ts="829.42" title="829.3" id=c_"829.3">__a__</span> really sort of fantasy. You don't pretend anything. You allow it to be extraterrestrial if you want. I didn't know that term before, but it's something that you are not obliged to respect. And it comes also from the French. And also before the French, there were these windows, you know, alcoholics and all. Right, right. And, so, so that freedom, I had to sort of, in my school, film school, which was my next school, kind of, first I had to obey the rules of film, which is always something that is protecting to be real, at least in that school. Right. And you could not just go and be, be out. So, but that's eventually collapsed. You see, I did some mostly documentary. 'cause we were taught first documentary, and then all the process of editing, how we cut things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>And you had to be narratives, you know? Right. And you make before then and after. So it had to be, <span style="color:red" data-ts="906.42" data-end_ts="906.64" title="906.42" id=c_"906.42">__yes__</span>. So absolutely. You know, sort of logical, you know. And if you, even if you were a cuckoo, you had to just give that function to a, a person, mostly actor, you know? So it's a kind of a whole, a different bag. Some people like it, some people are masters of it. Some people are very good at that. But, when I was facing, going to Hollywood, <span style="color:red" data-ts="934.97" data-end_ts="935.26" title="934.97" id=c_"934.97">__then__</span> I met Stan there. And, and she was playing <span style="color:red" data-ts="939.78" data-end_ts="939.98" title="939.78" id=c_"939.78">__<inaudible>__</span> violin or practicing violin there. And I asked her, she take me out <laugh>. 'cause I was at the end of, you know, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="949.9" data-end_ts="950.1" title="949.9" id=c_"949.9">__know__</span> my education there, and I, I said, I'm not gonna go to make films, you know? Right. I just, <span style="color:red" data-ts="956" data-end_ts="956.22" title="956" id=c_"956">__the__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="956.22" data-end_ts="956.46" title="956.22" id=c_"956.22">__normal__</span> cannot do it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>And she said, oh, sure, <laugh>. So we got married, and, she took me to Iceland, and it was very clear that, from Iceland, and she's got <span style="color:red" data-ts="972.84" data-end_ts="973.06" title="972.84" id=c_"972.84">__the__</span> ankle in Pennsylvania. And then that's how we ended, first, and then that's where I get my first English <span style="color:red" data-ts="983.66" data-end_ts="983.78" title="983.66" id=c_"983.66">__a__</span> little bit. And then I took me to Big Town, you know, where was that called? <laugh>? Yeah. This was, New York City. Yeah. Yeah. And first <span style="color:red" data-ts="999.19" data-end_ts="999.41" title="999.19" id=c_"999.19">__we__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="999.41" data-end_ts="999.61" title="999.41" id=c_"999.41">__were__</span> in the student environment, but I got a good lecture from this Jewish young kid that taught us dramatically, drastically English. And we were all these weird people from Orient and all. And so she beat us into pe. But after, you know, half a year, I could go downtown and we get some places to live and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1026.01" data-end_ts="1026.29" title="1026.01" id=c_"1026.01">__stay__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1026.29" data-end_ts="1026.53" title="1026.29" id=c_"1026.29">__around__</span>. Just, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1028.31" data-end_ts="1028.53" title="1028.31" id=c_"1028.31">__got__</span> really next to Andy Warhol crowd there, down, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1033.44" data-end_ts="1033.73" title="1033.44" id=c_"1033.44">__over__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>And then, we, I was supposed to go to Hollywood with my friends <span style="color:red" data-ts="1040.68" data-end_ts="1040.97" title="1040.68" id=c_"1040.68">__that__</span>, came from, that's kind of a fiction. You would never have gone to Hollywood <laugh>. Yeah. I don't know. But I realized I got very frightened to be something else. I got some interesting jobs around. I was freedom and enough to, I could still do work on my own and work for some, a group of people that, did special jobs. And, I learned a lot there. But then eventually it was clear to me that I stumbled over electronic images in acoustics, you know, in the sort of what's called the, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1084.94" data-end_ts="1085.16" title="1084.94" id=c_"1084.94">__the__</span>, what do you call in English? It's the, I mean, it synthesizes, you know, and my outburst synthesizer we got was <span style="color:red" data-ts="1099.52" data-end_ts="1099.76" title="1099.52" id=c_"1099.52">__<inaudible>__</span>, you know? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, you probably remember that. Right. And so, and then of course, that time we just stumbled over, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1110.61" data-end_ts="1110.96" title="1110.61" id=c_"1110.61">__kinda__</span> electronic pictures. We had a of course monitor and then plugged this <span style="color:red" data-ts="1117.98" data-end_ts="1118.2" title="1117.98" id=c_"1117.98">__all__</span> sort of in, and then, you know, and we, I understood it was a horizontal and vertical <span style="color:red" data-ts="1126.66" data-end_ts="1126.88" title="1126.66" id=c_"1126.66">__and__</span> know frequency. And then once you put it together, they actually make your picture, and you make all these, you know, square and, you know, all kind of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1139.74" data-end_ts="1139.96" title="1139.74" id=c_"1139.74">__the__</span> pictures. And so, and, and then we realized that we, not alone, you know, there's a whole community already in the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1149.4" data-end_ts="1149.64" title="1149.4" id=c_"1149.4">__street__</span>. This is mid, later <span style="color:red" data-ts="1151.78" data-end_ts="1152" title="1151.78" id=c_"1151.78">__for__</span>, you know, forties, sixties, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>Sixties, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>Eighties, sixties, neither forties or eighties. Sixties, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>Yeah. Oh, sixties, right. Sixties, yeah. <laugh>. And so we suddenly understood, wait a minute, we are not alone, but we are in the first generation of the kind of the things that would report, you know, of the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1179.49" data-end_ts="1179.77" title="1179.49" id=c_"1179.49">__<inaudible>__</span>, you know, format.

</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>I, I see your life slightly different. You weren't really an artist. I mean, you would never have described yourself an artist, nor would I, actually, or maybe somewhat more because I didn't have any other relationship to the planet. But when we started in <span style="color:red" data-ts="1207.97" data-end_ts="1208.17" title="1207.97" id=c_"1207.97">__video__</span>, it never occurred to us that we should do what other people do with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1213.41" data-end_ts="1213.73" title="1213.41" id=c_"1213.41">__<inaudible>__</span>. You know, we started right away going from feedback, be considerate art. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>Yeah. But <span style="color:red" data-ts="1222.27" data-end_ts="1222.55" title="1222.27" id=c_"1222.27">__this__</span> people have both that time musicians 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>Remember. Yeah. But we weren't what is called artist. And actually the way the American school artist artists is cut to anybody and everybody where it's some kind of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1237.71" data-end_ts="1237.83" title="1237.71" id=c_"1237.71">__an__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1237.83" data-end_ts="1238.15" title="1237.83" id=c_"1237.83">__honor__</span> be <span style="color:red" data-ts="1238.59" data-end_ts="1238.87" title="1238.59" id=c_"1238.59">__told__</span> on you in Europe. But it is obvious from the first time we did video, we did it in things that, in America would only TP described as art. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>But look at it this way, that time we also, I was associated, remember in that film group with this Avan <span style="color:red" data-ts="1262" data-end_ts="1262.32" title="1262" id=c_"1262">__artist__</span>, you know, the bo both guys, the Czech, what was his name? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>Sasha Hammed, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>No, hammed, and, Asha Hammed, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1272.02" data-end_ts="1272.24" title="1272.02" id=c_"1272.02">__the__</span> other Francis 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>Thompson. Yeah. There used to be Avantgarde in film in the United States, you know? Yeah. He was, he hadn't be a Czech, but he was working with other guy that the names still should be known, because they were really originally, radical individuals that would also touch the social consciousness. Mm-hmm. But then, then of course, when I met them, they were only producing, you know, for the big shots. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, see, like, and I ended cutting, you know, 70 millimeter, what is it called? Film. And, but then I said, hell, I mean, this is not what I want to do. So anyway, that time actually, the decision about taking things as electronic image was clear suddenly, because there was this tool and you could go on the street with it. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, we still use it as a record. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1335.68" data-end_ts="1335.84" title="1335.68" id=c_"1335.68">__remember__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1335.84" data-end_ts="1336.04" title="1335.84" id=c_"1335.84">__both__</span> of us, because there was no <span style="color:red" data-ts="1338" data-end_ts="1338.48" title="1338" id=c_"1338">__editing__</span> as such, you know, it was just a splicing of ugly things. So, and then, and then of course, then we find the material through the acoustics, and then we started to combine it and create visual <span style="color:red" data-ts="1355.78" data-end_ts="1356" title="1355.78" id=c_"1355.78">__of__</span> products. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>Yeah. But we felt it was kind of, because we were highly aware of people like say Stockhausen and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1362.28" data-end_ts="1362.48" title="1362.28" id=c_"1362.28">__<inaudible>__</span>, and 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>Oh, we were, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>You know, that was going on. And 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>We were highly cultured because we brought also a piece of Europe with us. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>Yeah. And, and then we immediately understood that this was the visual. And to, it, it was just, the same thing as the electronic music. But in visuals, we didn't have the problem <span style="color:red" data-ts="1383.52" data-end_ts="1383.8" title="1383.52" id=c_"1383.52">__there__</span>. But 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>The decision that we don't have to, that I don't have to go to Hollywood was so relieving <laugh>. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, I was so high. 'cause now I have my material, even if it was totally, you know, primitive. It was, it was yours. It was just exciting. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1401.1" data-end_ts="1401.32" title="1401.1" id=c_"1401.1">__And__</span> I knew the future immediately. I projected and I said, oh, when it gets to technological embrace, it will be just my future. And I, I knew that. Anyway. That's <crosstalk>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, so that's, that's fantastic. And the thing that I am, that, that's really interesting. And, and I don't think, in talking with you before, have you ever gone into such detail about sort of the feelings surrounding the war being such an influence to you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>Okay. So that's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1435.72" data-end_ts="1435.84" title="1435.72" id=c_"1435.72">__a__</span> very special, let's say, see, I was accident born across the airfield from the first war that was suddenly they built, you know, military built. This is the outside of outskirts of the place I was born called Bruno <span style="color:red" data-ts="1460.28" data-end_ts="1460.5" title="1460.28" id=c_"1460.28">__Bri__</span> in German. And, so it was just, it was just in front of us, but we were a little bit outside and there was an airfield. So since I was a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1473.5" data-end_ts="1473.7" title="1473.5" id=c_"1473.5">__kid__</span>, very young, I was always looking at that play. 'cause this, for, for me <span style="color:red" data-ts="1481.46" data-end_ts="1481.74" title="1481.46" id=c_"1481.46">__that__</span> it was a magic. You know, things came out of the ground and they flew. And then first I thought it flew because the, the wings were this way, you know, that they would be, they were pointing it up Yeah. Going forward, you know. And, by the speed of the going forward, forward would, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1503.37" data-end_ts="1503.86" title="1503.37" id=c_"1503.37">__forward__</span> would be elevated course. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>Later I learned that it has to <span style="color:red" data-ts="1509.02" data-end_ts="1509.22" title="1509.02" id=c_"1509.02">__have__</span> a special, the curve thing <span style="color:red" data-ts="1510.98" data-end_ts="1511.14" title="1510.98" id=c_"1510.98">__in__</span> the bottom of, of the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1512.92" data-end_ts="1513.14" title="1512.92" id=c_"1512.92">__way__</span> in order to lift the thing. Then I, the first time I understood that the world is not simple, you know, <laugh>, it's not a thing. Right. And that time, I was maybe five years, six years old. And so now when the war <span style="color:red" data-ts="1531.08" data-end_ts="1531.3" title="1531.08" id=c_"1531.08">__and__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1531.65" data-end_ts="1531.94" title="1531.65" id=c_"1531.65">__four__</span>, you know, the fight time through our village, you know, when the, but Nazis went to Russia and they were almost making it, you know, but then they were beaten back. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="1545.82" data-end_ts="1546.06" title="1545.82" id=c_"1545.82">__that__</span> was very fast when the Russians just got back. So at the age of seven <span style="color:red" data-ts="1552.76" data-end_ts="1552.98" title="1552.76" id=c_"1552.76">__of__</span> war, which going through the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1557.66" data-end_ts="1557.86" title="1557.66" id=c_"1557.66">__place__</span>, you know, not, where I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1559.66" data-end_ts="1560.06" title="1559.66" id=c_"1559.66">__walked__</span>. And then, you know, of course, we, runaway to, to the countryside for a while to get, sort of, a less fight we were expecting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>My family was expecting that there'll be a fight in the airfield and all that stuff. So, but in fact, it was much worse there in the countryside. But <span style="color:red" data-ts="1589.03" data-end_ts="1589.15" title="1589.03" id=c_"1589.03">__I__</span>, I saw the whole thing there, you know, people actually shooting each other in Russian. And they, so as a kid, I always look out the window and say, fuck, what did I see? So it was an interesting, kind of, observation. But by that time, I was fed by a lot of films. First from the Nazi, its system. The <span style="color:red" data-ts="1617.52" data-end_ts="1617.68" title="1617.52" id=c_"1617.52">__old__</span> kids had to go to these, movies. And the Hitler had two big productions. And, they were talking about the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1630.83" data-end_ts="1631.12" title="1630.83" id=c_"1630.83">__East__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1631.13" data-end_ts="1631.48" title="1631.13" id=c_"1631.13">__Front__</span> records and West <span style="color:red" data-ts="1634.12" data-end_ts="1634.44" title="1634.12" id=c_"1634.12">__Front__</span> record, because the Americans also were coming mm-hmm. <affirmative> into it. And we, kids were so knowledgeable about every detail, because there was one movie in the middle of the week, and the other movie was at the hand of the week. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>And that was produced by this Nazi propaganda. But, but they had to admit that the other armies are coming. Yeah. You know? Right, right. There was no way to hide it anymore. So then it was <span style="color:red" data-ts="1673.1" data-end_ts="1673.32" title="1673.1" id=c_"1673.1">__our__</span> education. Then we get books from the, again, from the propaganda of the Germans. It was very, very, very strict and truthful, because Germans, they were very profoundly, you know, detail. And we get books about the airplanes, all the names, speed, guns. And then there was something about, about, about boats. And, you know, the whole idea about, the, the, and about packs, and the cans. So we <span style="color:red" data-ts="1725.95" data-end_ts="1726.11" title="1725.95" id=c_"1725.95">__have__</span> these books and we quiz each other, guide kids in <span style="color:red" data-ts="1730.86" data-end_ts="1731.15" title="1730.86" id=c_"1730.86">__that__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1731.15" data-end_ts="1731.43" title="1731.15" id=c_"1731.15">__game__</span>. So how many cans is this machine? And some guys knew everything, and I was good. But then some of them didn't know shit. So we had total control over the Nazi apparatus, Uhhuh. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>But we were so glad. First we played a game between Russians and Germans. So we switch it. So not to be intimidated, but then when we, when the Germans started to lose, we didn't want to be the Germans. So we played <span style="color:red" data-ts="1769.57" data-end_ts="1769.79" title="1769.57" id=c_"1769.57">__the__</span>, the Cowboys and the Indians. Oh, <laugh>. So that was a solution of this <span style="color:red" data-ts="1777.49" data-end_ts="1777.71" title="1777.49" id=c_"1777.49">__be__</span> beginning stupid Iraq, Germans, you couldn't <span style="color:red" data-ts="1781.6" data-end_ts="1781.84" title="1781.6" id=c_"1781.6">__preview__</span> German anymore. So, and that's was the, basically the education of the war for us. And then <span style="color:red" data-ts="1789.72" data-end_ts="1789.92" title="1789.72" id=c_"1789.72">__it__</span> was, sorry, something like from London, that was a broadcast. And then you had to bring your, your sort of radio to the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1799.84" data-end_ts="1799.96" title="1799.84" id=c_"1799.84">__precious__</span> special place. And they would, you know, rip up some certain wave, wave wavelengths, you know, from the radio. But then themselves, the Nazis listened to it 'cause they didn't <span style="color:red" data-ts="1812.4" data-end_ts="1812.68" title="1812.4" id=c_"1812.4">__believe__</span> anymore in the propaganda. See? But then, these guys next door, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1818.82" data-end_ts="1819.04" title="1818.82" id=c_"1818.82">__we__</span> lived in this kind of larger kind of village, like outside of the city. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>And then, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1826.78" data-end_ts="1827" title="1826.78" id=c_"1826.78">__and__</span> they would come back to us, these friends, and they put it back, you know, when <span style="color:red" data-ts="1831.11" data-end_ts="1831.4" title="1831.11" id=c_"1831.11">__rest__</span> the Germans took out. Sure. So we were listening, but you could get really into jail or in concentration camp, they would catch you. But since they listen themselves, eventually they would come and look for the houses if the weapons and on. And so you had to hide these pieces of, material somewhere, you know, this, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1858.99" data-end_ts="1859.28" title="1858.99" id=c_"1858.99">__this__</span> sort of, things, you know, so it was <span style="color:red" data-ts="1863.32" data-end_ts="1863.44" title="1863.32" id=c_"1863.32">__a__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1863.45" data-end_ts="1863.8" title="1863.45" id=c_"1863.45">__risky__</span>, but I only have heard one case when the people were really punished for having this, listening to the, radio. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1875.26" data-end_ts="1875.48" title="1875.26" id=c_"1875.26">__It__</span> was a radio something, the name from it <span style="color:red" data-ts="1878.98" data-end_ts="1879.2" title="1878.98" id=c_"1878.98">__for__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1879.2" data-end_ts="1879.44" title="1879.2" id=c_"1879.2">__London__</span>. So we could very much understanding what, what's in the whole front. And so then we knew Germans were not gonna make it. So <span style="color:red" data-ts="1892.86" data-end_ts="1893.08" title="1892.86" id=c_"1892.86">__we__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1893.08" data-end_ts="1893.28" title="1893.08" id=c_"1893.08">__just__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1893.5" data-end_ts="1893.72" title="1893.5" id=c_"1893.5">__the__</span> freedom coming. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>So, and then we <span style="color:red" data-ts="1897.04" data-end_ts="1897.28" title="1897.04" id=c_"1897.04">__would__</span> expect <span style="color:red" data-ts="1898.58" data-end_ts="1898.8" title="1898.58" id=c_"1898.58">__by__</span> waiting for the takeover by the Russians, which <span style="color:red" data-ts="1905.9" data-end_ts="1906.12" title="1905.9" id=c_"1905.9">__it__</span> all happened. It was not very dramatic, except you could see, you know, from the windows. And also when, when we were in the, you know, we were in the countryside and, you know, and then there comes the Russians and ask, where are the Germans? And some idiots says, oh, they're far, they're all <span style="color:red" data-ts="1928.98" data-end_ts="1929.2" title="1928.98" id=c_"1928.98">__run__</span>. And something go. And then the, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1933.79" data-end_ts="1934.08" title="1933.79" id=c_"1933.79">__that__</span> you hear shooting. And then they got the guy that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1939.78" data-end_ts="1940.07" title="1939.78" id=c_"1939.78">__they__</span>, my buddies, you know, like the older guys sent him there to death. It was very bad, you know? So, but I, we have seen this like a theater, you know, that time I was probably about 10 years old. And, but then we started to collect all the weapons that were left, but they were asked to bring them to a special place in the village, you know, in a pile. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>But at night, we, we came, took the best weapons <laugh>, and then we made a whole trade with the weapons <laugh>. And so it goes on and on. There's tremendous amount of events after that. Of course, kids, this was the hilarious time. It's elevating. We were free, and the Russians were okay. They were just drinking. Occasionally. They tried to rape a woman, but they got shot by the officers. They're not supposed to do it. So it was, they kept it somehow together. You know, this, this Russian, high. And so, and that's, that's how <span style="color:red" data-ts="2015.7" data-end_ts="2015.92" title="2015.7" id=c_"2015.7">__the__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2016.66" data-end_ts="2016.88" title="2016.66" id=c_"2016.66">__all__</span> things exploded. And that's what I'm saying about the culture that followed. That was, I became slightly adult. You know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2026.3" data-end_ts="2026.52" title="2026.3" id=c_"2026.3">__in__</span> school we get <span style="color:red" data-ts="2027.58" data-end_ts="2027.8" title="2027.58" id=c_"2027.58">__the__</span> general education.

'cause we didn't want to be part of anything. And we had our own culture, music, jazz, and went to theaters. And so we had a very part of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2047.12" data-end_ts="2047.24" title="2047.12" id=c_"2047.12">__a__</span> wonderful three years of independence. Sure, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. It seems to me like your background would be very much different because you're from Iceland, which I don't think really got dragged into the war at all. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>They were not occupied only by the British and Americans. So that was sourced. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>Yeah. I used to hang on my fence on my house. 'cause the American soldiers, they had their headquarters or, or living quarter at the end of the street. And we would hang out there and ask them to give us chocolate, which they loved to do <laugh>. And when my mother found out, she absolutely <span style="color:red" data-ts="2090.42" data-end_ts="2090.64" title="2090.42" id=c_"2090.42">__for__</span> Pedros, and then we had to sneak it, sneak out there. And that's my first time I realized that I always like to sneak, break rules and sneak out. And not to, as I'm told you, that's kinda the first memory of doing that. But that has been my whole life. I just like to lie and, not, not, viciously, but just to not tell the truth. Because truth is rather boring. And when I tell people, people are <span style="color:red" data-ts="2122.51" data-end_ts="2122.75" title="2122.51" id=c_"2122.51">__usually__</span> shocked by it. And, except artists, I, I often <span style="color:red" data-ts="2129.77" data-end_ts="2129.99" title="2129.77" id=c_"2129.77">__out__</span>, they look at me in great sympathy and say, me too. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>You know, <laugh>, maybe that's, the real difference between artists and other people, their enjoyment of lying. Yeah. <laugh> or, or basically cheating or not telling the truth. And, yeah. Fiction dictation, this kind of things. But anyhow, that was my experience of the war. I remember the D-day because, we went down to the main square and the American soldiers came in and did double summer salts and all kinds of things. It was just that outburst of, joy that was enormous. And, I've been like four years old. 10 or five. Wow. But, I remember that. But, yeah, I, I lived kind of in a, in a fabulous, fictional world, as a child, as an early child. And it never bothered me. I had siblings and whole family that was very intellectual and very smart, and did well in school and everything. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>I did none of those things. And, and I wonder why it didn't bother me, why I didn't sit down and cry and say, I'm stupid. I can't do those things. But, my idea was just to not go to school. So I have very little schooling in my life, and I got sick, and that made it easy to just get a paper from the doctor that I couldn't go to school. And when my mother didn't want to produce this paper anymore, go to the doctor, I just went myself. He was on the main street in town on fifth floor. It was an elevator. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2242.76" data-end_ts="2242.98" title="2242.76" id=c_"2242.76">__It__</span> was <span style="color:red" data-ts="2243.02" data-end_ts="2243.22" title="2243.02" id=c_"2243.02">__very__</span> exciting to write up the elevator and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2245.48" data-end_ts="2245.7" title="2245.48" id=c_"2245.48">__to__</span> his office and say, I don't want to go to school. And he was a country kid educated in one school room. He knew exactly what I didn't need that for, and always gave me a paper. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>So I didn't go to school. I went for the exams in the spring. So I was always officially in the next, step, but, again, not going there. But you never actually attended, huh? You never attended? Not much. Oh. And then I got later into, like, when high school into taking the classes I wanted to take and not the others. I went to <span style="color:red" data-ts="2284.55" data-end_ts="2284.9" title="2284.55" id=c_"2284.55">__girly__</span> school, to <span style="color:red" data-ts="2285.74" data-end_ts="2285.94" title="2285.74" id=c_"2285.74">__girl__</span> school, and we were supposed to learn embroidery and, knitting and sewing and, cooking ironing. And I explained I wasn't interested in that and just skipped it. But I liked geography and mathematics. And so I went to those classes. And for me, this was normal. I thought everybody should do this. I have no idea until later that I have never met anybody else else who did schooling that way. But I thought that it was just not rational right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>Way to do. But, then I became obsessed with, education. I actually consider myself fairly educated, unschooled, but educated. Hmm. Because I went through this obsession of, I had to know as much as the people who knew. So I went to history books, and I went through, started comparing. Napoleon is born before Beethoven, because Beethoven wrote a symphony on Napoleon. And then when Napoleon traded the world by crowning himself, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2357.54" data-end_ts="2357.86" title="2357.54" id=c_"2357.54">__<inaudible>__</span> changed it into Ika Symphony, which was his third symphony. So I, I made my own kind of, explanation of how things happened because, I don't think that's how history is taught officially. Right. And, you, you also realize in history, you know, that it is basically traced through art only through art and victories on the battlefield. And that's the history you get down. So to combine them, like that was great deal of fun. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>Sure. And eventually, I was learning this violin and I was getting nowhere, which was partially my, that I had been sick and I didn't have much physicality for anything. I got tired of plane after 15 minutes. So I, I wasn't making much progress on the violin, but it was the only thing I liked to do was music. And I would go to every concert that was given in my hometown and also went to lot of lectures. And, and I always got in for free because <span style="color:red" data-ts="2429.35" data-end_ts="2430.02" title="2429.35" id=c_"2429.35">__eventually__</span> all the guys who took tickets, they knew me and they just, showed me through. Right. You know, and I would find a seat <span style="color:red" data-ts="2438.92" data-end_ts="2439.14" title="2438.92" id=c_"2438.92">__or__</span> sit on the steps or something and attend things like that. And I had time because I wasn't going to school. So I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2445.52" data-end_ts="2445.74" title="2445.52" id=c_"2445.52">__got__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2445.81" data-end_ts="2446.1" title="2445.81" id=c_"2445.81">__more__</span> things. And then there was a grant to go to Czech Republic, and that's Czechoslovakia because we were friendly and we were maybe the most friendly country in West Europe to East Europe. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>But it wasn't very friendly. They, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2467.48" data-end_ts="2467.7" title="2467.48" id=c_"2467.48">__so__</span> Cold War was so frightening. And, so when the Czechs offered to take a music student, I was the only applicant. So I got there, not because I, I knew how to play the violin, but because <span style="color:red" data-ts="2484.45" data-end_ts="2484.74" title="2484.45" id=c_"2484.45">__they__</span> were, you were the, the only one less scared. Huh? They were also scared. Wow. But the end of that story is very nice, because I was the first one to go who was not centered by the Communist Party. I was there as a cultural student. And after me, everybody started going there. There <span style="color:red" data-ts="2503.08" data-end_ts="2503.2" title="2503.08" id=c_"2503.08">__is__</span> a whole load of ice centers who has been educated in prac. It, it just needed somebody to break the wall and Sure. Yeah. And it was a very good education and it was absolutely for free and which included meals and board and everything. So, and you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Were studying specifically studying violin? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>I was, yeah. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="2528.52" data-end_ts="2528.64" title="2528.52" id=c_"2528.52">__I__</span>, it was the same pattern they were offering. Of course. Well, it was obligatory. You had to learn <span style="color:red" data-ts="2535.13" data-end_ts="2535.48" title="2535.13" id=c_"2535.13">__Marks__</span> Lenin theory, was that what it's called? <span style="color:red" data-ts="2538.32" data-end_ts="2538.56" title="2538.32" id=c_"2538.32">__Right__</span>, sure. And I never would go there. And I of course always told him I didn't understand the language <laugh> and, that was tolerated. But it only took me a year. And then I understood the language, but never let them know anybody in the school. So, so I was fanatic about art. I knew art was the only thing that counted, but I wasn't sure where I was in that if I had a role as an artist. 'cause I figured out I could eventually maybe play second violin and some low paying orchestra or something and have enough to, to live <span style="color:red" data-ts="2581.71" data-end_ts="2582" title="2581.71" id=c_"2581.71">__that__</span> I wouldn't die and that I could use the rest of the time to study and to live. And it's interesting because then when we came to New York, everybody thought that way. Everybody was trying to get minimum amount of money, somehow do some odd jobs, wait waitressing or whatever, just so that they wouldn't die mm-hmm. <affirmative>, but not enough to really live. And it was <span style="color:red" data-ts="2608.68" data-end_ts="2608.8" title="2608.68" id=c_"2608.68">__a__</span>, we found the whole society of people who thought that way to try to get away with it. You know? It was never <span style="color:red" data-ts="2615.66" data-end_ts="2615.88" title="2615.66" id=c_"2615.66">__any__</span> talk about earning money in our group. It didn't understand it was, downtown, which is where, what later was called Soho 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right now. Was that the, the desire not to get much money? Was it to try and avoid obligation or just to see if you could get away with it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>Get away with it. See, we, we were all obsessed with doing our thing as it was called. Right. And, but there is this idea about money. It needs to be there just so that you can pay a rent and pay some food. And both of these were extra ordinarily cheap in the sixties in New York. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, I remember we got ourselves <span style="color:red" data-ts="2658.16" data-end_ts="2658.28" title="2658.16" id=c_"2658.16">__a__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2658.28" data-end_ts="2658.44" title="2658.28" id=c_"2658.28">__lot__</span>, 425 bucks, and everybody was scolding us. Nobody pays over a hundred dollars for a loft, <laugh>. And it was a huge for Loft. It was great. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So you, you, the two of you can, well, before we get into it, Woody's story has a lot of relationship with war and fear. You seem to have a different relationship, which is kind of like skirting through your childhood, doing kind of as you wish, and finding a way to study things, that you were obsessed with. At some point you made decisions that caused you to, to get serious about your instrument and eventually to move to New York. What were, what were the things that caused, what were the events that caused you to make those changes? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>See, Woody asked me to liberate him from Czech. It was a very oppressive So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Did you meet him while you were there studying? Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>I, him, I was studying. Okay. And I dragged him outta that country. And then came the question, where are we gonna go? Because obviously, would we <span style="color:red" data-ts="2732.64" data-end_ts="2732.8" title="2732.64" id=c_"2732.64">__want__</span> to go go to Iceland and live there as a happy Iceland <span style="color:red" data-ts="2736.99" data-end_ts="2737.28" title="2736.99" id=c_"2736.99">__ever__</span> after? And we, I hadn't done the states. I had done Europe. I, I lived for a while in Germany and then <span style="color:red" data-ts="2746.63" data-end_ts="2746.92" title="2746.63" id=c_"2746.63">__work__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2746.94" data-end_ts="2747.16" title="2746.94" id=c_"2746.94">__and__</span> here and there. So it was obvious that we would come to the States, but we came just as a tourist. Us people. We, we weren't gonna immigrate. Right. Immigrate. There was never any agenda. And we wouldn't have, if the person who did our immigration papers, we had to show up every three months <span style="color:red" data-ts="2768.62" data-end_ts="2768.84" title="2768.62" id=c_"2768.62">__and__</span> get a extension of the visa. Right. And she said, I can't give you any <span style="color:red" data-ts="2773.56" data-end_ts="2773.76" title="2773.56" id=c_"2773.56">__more__</span> extension. You had enough. And we <span style="color:red" data-ts="2776.28" data-end_ts="2776.4" title="2776.28" id=c_"2776.28">__would__</span> say, okay, we'll leave. And she said, don't leave. Get a lawyer. It's amazing. We have never thought we should get a lawyer. So then we had a green card. And because when you have a green card, you tend to stay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So this puts, this puts you all in New York, which is kind of the, the point at which, history books normally pick up your narrative, which is that you are part of this kind of underground artist world that starts, that starts doing things, doing kind of radical things. Right. Who, who are the instigators from your perspective? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>See, William of course, was working in a place that, he persuaded them to have video. And the reason he persuaded them is that he had gotten <span style="color:red" data-ts="2838.19" data-end_ts="2838.68" title="2838.19" id=c_"2838.19">__weather__</span> of this video, video as art, actually mostly through, an exhibit in Howard <span style="color:red" data-ts="2846.75" data-end_ts="2847.04" title="2846.75" id=c_"2846.75">__Wise__</span> gallery of people who then became our colleagues. But there were all kinds of things going on there. There was something called Automation House, and it was totally dedicated to electronic arts. And this is actually before we started ourselves. So it was kind of in the air, it was just the environment. It was particular, we knew about <span style="color:red" data-ts="2871.96" data-end_ts="2872.32" title="2871.96" id=c_"2871.96">__<inaudible>__</span>. I had actually heard about him, operating in Europe sort of in the mid sixties. He came to Riceland and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2880.96" data-end_ts="2881.08" title="2880.96" id=c_"2880.96">__at__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2881.08" data-end_ts="2881.48" title="2881.08" id=c_"2881.08">__Scandal__</span> and so on and so forth. And so, we were, we were just there. And what, but what is interesting is as soon as we decided to do video, we had to learn English. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Steina: </b>We had to start talking to each other in English because we didn't know any electronic terms and Czech. Sure. And, we started communicating with the English speaking people, so-called Americans in New York. And we started dropping off our European friends <span style="color:red" data-ts="2916.7" data-end_ts="2916.99" title="2916.7" id=c_"2916.7">__with__</span>, with <span style="color:red" data-ts="2917.41" data-end_ts="2917.63" title="2917.41" id=c_"2917.41">__sea__</span>. It was like a, a fierce of, of fun and parties and things. From the time we arrived until we started in video, we just, we just lived and partied and, were around. And they were, they were kind of very frustrated that we just one day disappeared from the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2940.43" data-end_ts="2940.67" title="2940.43" id=c_"2940.43">__raid__</span>. We would be English speaking and doing American type art and, schmoozing with different people. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2952.51" data-end_ts="2952.8" title="2952.51" id=c_"2952.51">__Well__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2952.86" data-end_ts="2953.08" title="2952.86" id=c_"2952.86">__we__</span> just interfere a little bit in a different, trajectory. Sure. Because, when I, look what happened to me to sit here now, you know, for example, how did I ever end it in this? Because it's so rational now when I look at it. But I, that means I have to admit, I have no idea, how to act. But I must have been opportunist or advised by something that I still don't understand. What, let's say, look at this way, that when I went through my beginnings and the war, of course was essential. And, just to give you some kind of more hands <span style="color:red" data-ts="3011.98" data-end_ts="3012.2" title="3011.98" id=c_"3011.98">__on__</span> situation, living across to, you know, this airplane situation. These young Nazi pilots would, you know, fly every three months after education, training in the school. And they get a free ride. They just are supposed to fly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b>Mm-hmm. <affirmative> now, you know, from this, you know, 14 or 16 guys <span style="color:red" data-ts="3046.66" data-end_ts="3046.88" title="3046.66" id=c_"3046.66">__and__</span> one usually crashed two. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="3051.08" data-end_ts="3051.28" title="3051.08" id=c_"3051.08">__we__</span> as kids were waiting 'cause we knew they were coming up. And, and so, and we were just concentrating watching it. And then there was this hill just before, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3066.86" data-end_ts="3067.08" title="3066.86" id=c_"3066.86">__the__</span>, the thing, they, they would go down. And that was the place when about three in that half a year crashed. And then we were waiting for that opportunity because, we could be there right after the guys, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3089.3" data-end_ts="3089.52" title="3089.3" id=c_"3089.3">__the__</span>, their bunch of, German doctors and soldiers and everything would, run there. They pick up the boys, took their pieces of the boys, took the, you know, some of the weapons and just went, they didn't have interest in any, anything about it. And the boys were behind the corner. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3115.02" data-end_ts="3115.24" title="3115.02" id=c_"3115.02">__We__</span> just went there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Woody: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="3117.02" data-end_ts="3117.24" title="3117.02" id=c_"3117.02">__We__</span> completely took these airplanes apart. It was difficult. But, and we always find this secret. There's always secret in the, in the wing, for the emergency. There was a gun. There was, you know, something for sleeping. And we <span style="color:red" data-ts="3140.16" data-end_ts="3140.36" title="3140.16" id=c_"3140.16">__were__</span> some money and the guys didn't want to touch it. They just didn't want to open it. But we do, we did. So because <span style="color:red" data-ts="3149.83" data-end_ts="3150.12" title="3149.83" id=c_"3149.83">__with__</span> the good stuff, you know, and then we <span style="color:red" data-ts="3152.19" data-end_ts="3152.68" title="3152.19" id=c_"3152.19">__handled__</span> hand it and exchange it. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="3155.46" data-end_ts="3155.68" title="3155.46" id=c_"3155.46">__so__</span>, so the, it was the first time that understood that, you know, how this whole system is working. We put also parts of the engines that we could carry mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And we took them home and then we worked on it, you know, so this was my first kind of touch with this high quality material. And, and Nazi that time was very much advanced. And, my father had a workshop downstairs in the house, so I just spent hours taking apart and studying it. So that's how I got the bug. You see, I get <span style="color:red" data-ts="3201.96" data-end_ts="3202.12" title="3201.96" id=c_"3201.96">__the__</span> bug, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3203.14" data-end_ts="3203.36" title="3203.14" id=c_"3203.14">__the__</span> bug for <span style="color:red" data-ts="3203.8" data-end_ts="3204" title="3203.8" id=c_"3203.8">__here__</span>.

<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. So there you go. That's the first half of the interview with the SCAs. The second half is going to drop on Wednesday where they talk about Buffalo, Santa Fe.
