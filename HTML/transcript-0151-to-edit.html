<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today I have the, the great pleasure to introduce you to someone who has, become a good friend of mine. He's one of my coworkers. I work with a lot of really cool people. This is one of 'em. He is, he's a software developer at Cycling 74. He has his hands in a lot of different pies and, I'm just really happy to get a chance to talk to him a little bit more about his background and stuff. His name's Tim Place He's done a lot of things over his career. I'll let him talk about it. But, stuff is to say he is a very fascinating guy and I'm looking forward to the discussion. So, Hey, Tim, how are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim Place: </b>I'm good, Darwin. Thanks for, having me. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thanks. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>I feel humbled to be on here <span style="color:red" data-ts="58.685" data-end_ts="58.965" title="58.685" id=c_"58.685">__with__</span>, there's like this pantheon of amazing people that you've interviewed. Well, it's, it's, I'm not sure if I belong in that group or not. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> Well, it's gotten to be quite a list of interesting folks, that's for sure. But I absolutely think that you belong on there Yeah. For any one of a number of things that you've been involved with. So we'll get to a bunch of those. But let's start off by talking a little bit about what you're currently working on. What's some of the stuff that you've been doing lately? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>Well, I've been doing a lot of work, in c plus plus and, some of the more, modern extensions to c plus plus, and figuring out ways to structure how we create max objects. That's one thing I've been doing. And then also trying to, go back and kind of bring back topics that I've taught at the university in terms of how do filters work, for example, and share that with the audiences <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_%2774">Cycling '74</a> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. You've done some videos for, that we've been able to share in a newsletter that have been pretty eye-opening for me. Just, I, I was always able to follow the math because I would find a book that would tell me, here, do this. And what I found kind of remarkable about, about what you did is you kind of explained the concept behind it, and it turns out that, you know, now I have to think less about which book I'm gonna steal the code from, because I sort of like, better know what it is I'm trying to accomplish. That's pretty powerful. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>Yeah. Well, I don't have a strong math, math background. In high school, I remember we got to logarithms in the 11th grade and I asked the teacher like, where am I gonna use this <laugh>? Like, I don't need this to balance my checkbook, so what's the deal? Right. And the teacher couldn't give me an answer. Yeah. So basically at that point, I checked out on math and I didn't take any math courses at all until I was working on my doctorate. And then I'm working on my doctorate, and I am in freshman algebra, you know, <laugh>. Wow. Figure out how this stuff works. So I'm, I'm sensitive to the, <span style="color:red" data-ts="194.625" data-end_ts="194.845" title="194.625" id=c_"194.625">__the__</span> musician's plight when Yeah. Time for, encountering math. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I often talk when I, when I'm teaching and, I talk about things like the scale object and stuff as ways of, you know, sort of avoiding math by doing, you know, something else. Right. And I always kind of tease about how we're all artists because we, self-selected right out of the math class. Right. But in a lot of cases, what you're talking about is really important because, you know, my wife, you know, a few years ago went back to school to get, an updated teaching degree certification. And, as part of that, she had to take a trigonometry class. And I was like, oh, trigonometry. I think I might remember what that looked like from 10th grade. Right. And I looked at it and all of a sudden I realized what I was looking at was a lot of the math behind audio. Right. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And, yeah, this, I, this idea that I had, I too checked out on certain things and just never revisited 'em again. And when I needed to use those functions or whatever, I would always kind of depend on other people's work. It was, it was kind of humbling, humbling experience. So let, let's talk a little bit about your past. So you, you weren't into math until you were working on your doctorate. First of all, what was your path to get to <span style="color:red" data-ts="276.925" data-end_ts="277.085" title="276.925" id=c_"276.925">__your__</span>, to trying to get your doctorate? Because so do you, have you actually gotten your doctorate? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>I'm what we would call a BD. Okay. I got to a point working on a doctorate where basically I was at a conservative, you know, a conservatory Mm-Hmm. Of music. And, and really the model there is that you're gonna write, you know, a, a concerto, a piano concerto with orchestra or something. And I, I was bringing in all kinds of crazy stuff and, I put together <span style="color:red" data-ts="306.845" data-end_ts="306.965" title="306.845" id=c_"306.845">__a__</span> <laugh> a proposed, dissertation, which included like appendices with schematics for, the T box sensor interface and all this c plus plus code. And like, there's all kinds of stuff that were required in order to realize my music. And they just looked at, we're like, we have no idea what to do with this. You, you need to like, go back and, and do something that we can talk about. And at that time, I had a kid and like everything was just kind of going crazy. I just <span style="color:red" data-ts="340.485" data-end_ts="340.645" title="340.485" id=c_"340.485">__got__</span> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_%2774">Cycling '74</a> gig and, the fire kind of fizzled out on that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So, I mean, ha has the, has that school changed at all subsequently? I mean, it seems like, so this would've been what, maybe 10 years ago? Something 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>Like that? Yeah. This would've been about 10, 12 years ago ago. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It seems like a lot of universities have kind of changed their approach to things in the intervening decade. Do you think there's any chance that it would work again to show up with schematics in a, in a max patch? Or do you think that you just, you don't have the desire anymore? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>Yeah, I mean, I don't really have the desire anymore. I have a lot of other things going on, and the piece of paper would be great for my ego, but I don't really consider padding my ego to be a worthy pursuit. So, oh 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Man. See, I do, but that's just me, <laugh> <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>That's most people, I think. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I think maybe so. So your doctorate, the doctorate you were trying for was a, a music doctorate, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>Yeah. DMA, yeah. Doctorate musical arts. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. So explain to me the path of going from a high school student that apparently didn't care for math to a person attempting to get their music doctorate. What, how did you get from one place to that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>Okay, so if we go a ways back between the, seventh and eighth grade, my father brought home a new computer. And this new computer, among other things, had GW Basic on it. <laugh>. So you could launch that up in Doss. And, and I, and I actually wrote, started writing programs over the summer and, and read the manual from Microsoft and how to program basic and did like silly stuff, role-playing games. And I wrote a database to keep track of my baseball cards, you know, silly stuff. So I had this <span style="color:red" data-ts="458.105" data-end_ts="458.345" title="458.105" id=c_"458.105">__inter__</span> interest in technology and I was in music all the way through to playing trombone. And then when I got to high school, <span style="color:red" data-ts="465.385" data-end_ts="465.505" title="465.385" id=c_"465.385">__I__</span> had this really amazing band director and he was into film scoring. And so we had a, we had a studio in high school. And when I came in the door for, my senior year of high school, the school had gotten a grant and he had gotten a Kurtz <span style="color:red" data-ts="484.125" data-end_ts="484.245" title="484.125" id=c_"484.125">__wall__</span> K 2000. And we had Cakewalk 2.0 <laugh>, which, which had that kale programming language in it. <span style="color:red" data-ts="491.205" data-end_ts="491.285" title="491.205" id=c_"491.205">__Right__</span>? Yes. I dunno if you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Remember that or not. Yeah, I, I totally do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>And, and so my high school band director sat down and started teaching me all this stuff. And we made, I actually did like a film score for a film that a friend of mine was doing over in the video studio, which, like, no high schools had video studios in the early nineties, but my high school did. 'cause we were in a wealthy suburb. So, so I got to, you know, use STI time code and all this stuff in high school in the early nineties. And I was basically like, oh man, I wanna write, I wanna write music for films coming outta high school. I was thinking that I went to school for my undergraduate for music ed because my parents wanted me to be able to get a job. But basically I, I was taking 23 credit hours a semester so that I could do all of the composition stuff. Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>And once I got to the end of that, I was like, I'm not gonna go teach. I'm gonna go <laugh>, you know, I'm gonna go to grad school and, and write music. And, you know, my, my undergrad, we were working with reel <span style="color:red" data-ts="559.255" data-end_ts="559.375" title="559.255" id=c_"559.255">__to__</span> reel machines and we had a copy of Max 3.0 that nobody knew what to do with. And I kind of taught myself how to screw around with that a little bit. Yeah. So, I mean, I was kind of in this electronic music technology space all along in, 1998, which was my senior year of college, went to my first Seamus conference. It was at Dartmouth University. And the first session that I went to, the first paper session, David Zicarelli was there, and he showed us this version of Max that processed audio. Like I had screwed around with Max a little bit. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>Mostly I used it to, do stupid stuff. Like I would map the pitch bend wheel on a controller to the, we had an ESI 32 sampler. Okay. And if you blasted it with enough noons out of the pitch bend wheel, you could get it to hang <laugh>. And when it did, it made these incredible sounds <laugh> and I could dump 'em into pro tools and use it as part of a texture uhhuh <affirmative>. So I was just doing stupid stuff. But once I saw that you could do audio signals, 'cause David was showing MSP, which was brand new, it was like, holy cow. And that's really where I, I started following the rabbit down the hole. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>All of a sudden, all of a sudden you didn't have to depend on breaking a sampler in order to get a great sound. Huh. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>Yeah. And, and it didn't take long before I was like, well, shoot, I want an object to do this. I want an object to do that. So then I, with the help of, grad school fuga, I learned how to write max external so I could start doing more stuff. And basically I like learned c and c plus plus from the max SDK and, and drinking a lot of coffee at Barnes and Noble <laugh>, you know, this is like, Google wasn't really a thing yet. Right. So, so I was a musician with a, with a programming hobby. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Programming problem, <span style="color:red" data-ts="678.075" data-end_ts="678.295" title="678.075" id=c_"678.075">__you__</span> know, <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>Backwards from 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So what, what instrument were you playing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>Trombone. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Trombone. Interesting. Because that's trombone isn't normally what you think of too, as a, as sort of like a entree instrument into electronic music. Was it just what you started with in grade school and so you just stuck with it? Or? It 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>Is what I started with in grade school. My grandfather played the trombone and I grew up, my mom, her favorite band was Chicago. Mm-Hmm. <span style="color:red" data-ts="708.615" data-end_ts="708.655" title="708.615" id=c_"708.615">__<affirmative>__</span>. So I grew up listening to Chicago. Right. All the time. And I mean, I had trombone kind of infused into me. Right. I hear you. And, and it's not the prototypical instrument in terms of, when you think about interactive computer music or whatever. Right. But I do think that the trombone sound, it has this certain like fatness and resonance to it that gives you a real ear for like analog synthesis types of sounds. So for me, actually, it's, it's, it's a real natural, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's a natural fit. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>Because just because of the, the Tamil qualities. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, there's also the fact that it, it's sort of has user definable tuning to a certain extent that, that can open your ears. 'cause I always feel like one of the things that's important that when, when I talk to people who become experimental in their music interests, there's always like some pre points, right. The things that open their ears to something new. And sometimes it's, you know, sometimes it's grandpa's record collection, right. Or dad's record collection. Sometimes it's, you know, I ran across this instrument and it broke my head open, or I ran across an album that, at a store that had a cool cover and it blew my head open. But I always think too, that there has to be something, there has to be some things that you sort of experience. And I think with Trumble <span style="color:red" data-ts="805.345" data-end_ts="805.565" title="805.345" id=c_"805.345">__and__</span> the fact that it doesn't have this like, like fretted or specific pitch orientation, actually, it forces your ear to hear the spaces between notes. And I think that that's really useful as you expand your musical repertoire. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>That's, absolutely true in my experience as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So for you, what is the thing that cracked your head open for experimentalism? <span style="color:red" data-ts="829.665" data-end_ts="829.885" title="829.665" id=c_"829.665">__Is__</span> it, was it that working with this band director? Did he, did he like, introduce you not only to programming and ti but also more experimental music areas? Because certainly film scoring can go that way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>It can, but he was more of a jazz. Like he was more into Yeah. Jazz charts and that type of thing. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, he, he wasn't particularly experimental. It wasn't until I got to college and got introduced to more of the experimental stuff where it was like, okay, there was a composition professor there named Paul Steinberg who took me under his wing. And, there weren't a lot of comp students. So, and especially not a lot of comp students that were interested in the electronic stuff, but he was like, okay, here, here's your listening list. You're gonna go listen to Morton Nik silver Apples in the moon, and like you go up to the library and get out the, the reel to reel <laugh>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="885.905" data-end_ts="886.125" title="885.905" id=c_"885.905">__We__</span> still listen to stuff in the library and reel <span style="color:red" data-ts="888.005" data-end_ts="888.085" title="888.005" id=c_"888.005">__to__</span> reels. Oh man. And, you know, start listening to some stuff. And, and my, I was already open to all the synthesizer stuff anyway. I you mentioned dad's record, record collection, you know, it's like my father had this stack of these eight track cassettes and, there were like bootlegs of Emerson Lake and Palmer Concerts. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> <laugh>. Okay. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>So I was <span style="color:red" data-ts="914.245" data-end_ts="914.445" title="914.245" id=c_"914.245">__all__</span>, I already had the synthesizers and everything in my, in my brain. And, yeah, I mean, I really got fascinated, I think from watching live concerts. The thing that fascinated me, the thing that still fascinates me is, I don't know if you remember back in the, I don't know, it was probably early nineties, there were these ads on in the magazines and also on tv. You know, is it live or is it Mex? Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="941.975" data-end_ts="942.095" title="941.975" id=c_"941.975">__like__</span>, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>And and that was my, that, that was actually like an aesthetic thing that I adopted. I like it to have a performer on stage performing with all these electronics, but there always to be this ambiguity about like, well, is that coming from the performer or is that coming from the electronics or what's going on? So that there's, there's sort of like this mystical, supernatural other worldliness, but still grounded. So the electronic sounds aren't like divorced from reality. And you're, you're kind of forced to confront as a listener, like, well, what, what's going on here? So that's, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Is that, is that the kind of composition stuff that you were doing as you advanced through your degree program? Were you trying to sort of do that mix and match of techno? Because some, clearly you said you started writing max externals with the help of a collaborator. And you know, when I first got to know you, you had a pretty significant library of max, max tools because you know that you called the TAP tools. You also by then were, I think you had already, or you were, you had just gotten at a point of having the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1028.985" data-end_ts="1029.205" title="1028.985" id=c_"1028.985">__tee__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1029.265" data-end_ts="1029.485" title="1029.265" id=c_"1029.265">__box__</span> sensor interface pulled together and you were starting to put together different sensing devices. Was all driven by your interests and the compositions that you were doing at the time, or were you driven by something else? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>It was the compositions at the time. I mean, the TAP tools was like, I wanna do this piece and I need a reverb. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And there's no free, the only free VST reverb is the free verb and it sounds like a dead dog in a garage. <laugh>. And, and I need a pitch shifter and the only pitch shifter available for Max is in the this ear <span style="color:red" data-ts="1070.025" data-end_ts="1070.245" title="1070.025" id=c_"1070.025">__cam__</span> package you have to pay a lot of money for. And I'm a poor college student. Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1074.905" data-end_ts="1075.125" title="1074.905" id=c_"1074.905">__And__</span> so it was like, I would basically, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1076.965" data-end_ts="1077.125" title="1076.965" id=c_"1076.965">__top__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1077.125" data-end_ts="1077.285" title="1077.125" id=c_"1077.125">__tools__</span> were like, oh, I wanna do this thing and I need an object to do it. And so, yeah. I, I eventually, you know, there ended up being like a hundred objects in that, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>Monstrosity of a package. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So I can see that because that seems like a modest jump. Like, I need this one thing to accomplish a task, I'm gonna do this one thing. And especially with the Max SDKA, once you kinda learn how it operates, then doing the next thing isn't that big of a leap. Right. How the hell did you do the T Box? So for those who aren't familiar, the T <span style="color:red" data-ts="1114.745" data-end_ts="1114.965" title="1114.745" id=c_"1114.745">__box__</span> is a sensor interface that used <span style="color:red" data-ts="1118.145" data-end_ts="1118.365" title="1118.145" id=c_"1118.145">__SP__</span> diff audio interface to get high speed sensing data into the computer. Is that a fair assessment? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>That is correct. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. <laugh>. So how do you just say, gee, I need a sensor box and I'm gonna design an audio interface <laugh>. Yeah. It seems like an improbable jump. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>Well, I, I was helping, Jesse Allison, who's now at LSU mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I was working with him on some of his installations trying to help him figure out how to do the sensor stuff. And then we collaborated on some installations and, I mean just like, there was always something frustrating or wrong about the whole deal. And it was like the USB ports on the Mac and the G fours and the G threes, they were just like, they were so unreliable. We had an installation, at ICMC in Gothenburg, Sweden. And the, computer would just freak out and lose its USB ports. So like we were trying to do this thing with the basic stamp and whatever communicating to a serial port through a serial, the USB converter, and then you have to go over and restart the computer at least once or twice a day 'cause of the USB port problem. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>Okay. So it was like, I did not want anything to do with USB port. So like, how are you gonna get stuff into the computer if you can't use the USB port? That's like kind of an issue. So it's like, well, we could use an audio signal. So actually we had some versions that we'd use these little 5 5 5 timers. Yeah. Which is just like a little square wave generator thing. And then we would like count the zero crossings on the, as the audio stream. We also tried, we just tried a whole bunch of different stuff and it Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and it all like, had different problems. But, we were presenting one of those things where we had, we were sending a bunch of sign waves in and then running a bunch of band pass filters in MSP and we were trying to track the, the RMS envelope of the sign waves Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>For our sensor data. Alright. But it wasn't very responsive. So anyway, I was at the nine conference in Montreal in 2003, which had two big things. One of 'em is that, I talked with alimony and then we ended up developing the hypno <span style="color:red" data-ts="1263.805" data-end_ts="1263.965" title="1263.805" id=c_"1263.805">__scope__</span> and hypno and stuff out of Oh right. His work from that conference. But the other one was, with the sensor stuff, Jesse and I were talking with David Wessell and we, we spent quite a bit of time talking to David Wessell and he agreed with like all of our assessment of all of the problems. And he is like, well, I wonder if you could, you know, we have this Remus box over here and we're taking sensors and blah, blah, blah, blah. You can probably do something more like what you're doing if you just sent the audio over a IFF connection. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>We're like, oh, how about that? So really it was kind of a David Wessel I idea. And I mean, that man is, he always had amazing ideas. He was amazingly generous with Yeah. With sharing them and supporting, supporting people to, to run with 'em. So yeah, that's, that's how we got the idea. That's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>Then we had the big learning curve, but I mean, it was the same thing. Go hang out at Barnes and Noble and like look at all the books back when Barnes and Noble had a lot of books, <laugh>, you know. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. And now they have like Legos and stuffed toys filling up half the store. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>Yeah. There was this O'Reilly book they had on the shelf at Barnes and Noble. It was designing embedded hardware. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh wow. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>And so it was kind of like a no brainer to buy that book. Yeah, no kidding. But, but it, I mean it was a lot of work for a couple of musicians to do that. And so 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You learned the electronics and everything just out of, out of Barnes and Noble books. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>So mostly yes. The, we had another Saving Grace though, which is that my father's an electrical engineer. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, nice. Nice. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>And if, we got in over our heads <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Dad. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>Yeah, exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Actually not <span style="color:red" data-ts="1377.175" data-end_ts="1377.335" title="1377.175" id=c_"1377.175">__the__</span>, not the typical dad. I need help call from college, I would guess. But, you know, it's, it's not like Dad I got busted 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b><laugh>. Yeah. My dad loved it 'cause it was like, you know, I, it was like he thought all of us kids should go into science and engineering. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know, and then I went to college for music and my sister went to college for Art <laugh>. You know, it's like we started down this road of like, nobody doing science and engineering <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, although, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>You know, here <span style="color:red" data-ts="1408.215" data-end_ts="1408.255" title="1408.215" id=c_"1408.215">__I__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1408.255" data-end_ts="1408.375" title="1408.255" id=c_"1408.255">__am__</span> the prodigal <span style="color:red" data-ts="1408.895" data-end_ts="1409.095" title="1408.895" id=c_"1408.895">__son__</span> coming home. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Really. Although, you know what, I actually, I actually believe that, I think that there's, there's a lot of place for, for studied engineers, but I know an awful lot of people who got eng engineering degrees back when I wasn't getting mine who are unemployed because all the engineering they learned back then is useless now. Right. I mean, the, the engineering fields change pretty fast and especially, it's almost like the more detail you get into, the worse off you eventually end up with in your career. So where, art is always useless. So <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So there's that. But, that's really interesting and, and sort of sort of mind bending to think of taking on that kind of, that kind of task. It's pretty interesting. Now you mentioned, you mentioned the work on, the hypno <span style="color:red" data-ts="1462.655" data-end_ts="1462.895" title="1462.655" id=c_"1462.655">__scope__</span> and the hypno plugin, project. The interface for that was pretty unique because it used this node <span style="color:red" data-ts="1471.215" data-end_ts="1471.495" title="1471.215" id=c_"1471.215">__based__</span> thing that was automatable in VST world and it was really kind of, it was very unique for how, how plugins worked up to that, you know, in comparison to that point. But there was also, I mean, it wasn't just that interface, there was also a lot of kind of weirdo techniques that, that a lot of the plugins provided. What was all that stuff, kind of things that you had come up with while you're, while you were in school? Or did you just, or was it more like, Hey, I have to make plugins. What's the weirdest stuff I can come up with? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>There's some of both. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, once we had that interface, it made it possible to use some things I'd experimented with previously that didn't work very well. Okay. Because some of those plugins are really particular and real tweaky with the settings. And you could like have <span style="color:red" data-ts="1525.685" data-end_ts="1525.885" title="1525.685" id=c_"1525.685">__this__</span> a bunch of settings that depending on the sound source might do nothing. Right. Or, or might just produce silence, you know. And then <span style="color:red" data-ts="1533.885" data-end_ts="1534.085" title="1533.885" id=c_"1533.885">__if__</span> you change the sound source, then all of a sudden you've got like Star Wars going on. Right. So that hypno <span style="color:red" data-ts="1541.995" data-end_ts="1542.235" title="1541.995" id=c_"1541.995">__scope__</span> really, made it so that some of these effects would work with a wide variety of sounds because you could like basically like swim through or navigate through this like whole terrain of, of sounds. And so I had all these like sort of dead experiments sitting on my computer and, and then the granular things were done by Nathan <span style="color:red" data-ts="1567.505" data-end_ts="1567.795" title="1567.505" id=c_"1567.505">__Wock__</span>. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, now at Stetson University. And he, you know, he had this whole like pool of things that he used in performance all the time. So a lot of those granular plugins were things he'd already been performing with. Right. And we added hypno <span style="color:red" data-ts="1583.435" data-end_ts="1583.635" title="1583.435" id=c_"1583.435">__scope__</span> to it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>So, and Jesse also, added some stuff to that package because at that point we had started, electro <span style="color:red" data-ts="1594.775" data-end_ts="1594.995" title="1594.775" id=c_"1594.775">__Tap__</span>, which was basically the company we used to finance the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1598.455" data-end_ts="1598.675" title="1598.455" id=c_"1598.455">__tee__</span> box development. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>Once we couldn't get any grants to pay for it. It <laugh> you <span style="color:red" data-ts="1603.725" data-end_ts="1603.965" title="1603.725" id=c_"1603.725">__decide__</span> you have to start a company to pay for it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, if I remember Electro <span style="color:red" data-ts="1608.665" data-end_ts="1608.885" title="1608.665" id=c_"1608.665">__Tap__</span> kind of did a bunch of stuff. So you did the tee box, you also did a bunch of sensors and at the time, as I recall, they were sort of like the highest quality sensors people could buy. So other people that would get sensor boxes like the croon or some of these other things would still come to you to buy their sensors. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>Yeah. I mean, and the sensors we were selling are, I mean, they're still really good. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I mean the tee box is actually still really good too, but I mean, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1638.175" data-end_ts="1638.395" title="1638.175" id=c_"1638.175">__we__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1638.395" data-end_ts="1638.555" title="1638.395" id=c_"1638.395">__don't__</span>, it's cost prohibitive now. 'cause the price that people are willing to pay has gone way, way down. Right. But, yeah, I mean all the sensors they had like this little conditioning circuit, so every sensor right. By the sensor itself, there'd be an op amp and I mean, it would basically like get the signal into the perfect range with, with lots of power to drive it over a long cable. Right. And, over a long ca cable with a balanced signal. So it would be immune to 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>To noise and stuff <span style="color:red" data-ts="1673.575" data-end_ts="1673.865" title="1673.575" id=c_"1673.575">__Yeah__</span>. To 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>RF interference and Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, but also, weren't you at one point also making hemispheric speakers? Am I remembering that right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>Well, so my friend Stefan Moore, Stefan and I lived in Baltimore at the same time. Mm-Hmm. Okay. And, he had, started producing these hemispheric speakers, with, with some of the folks at Rensselaer. And we had this company, so it was like, Hey, we've already got the mechanism to like process credit cards and stuff, which wasn't as easy then as it is now <laugh>. Right. But, we had all the infrastructure in place and he was looking for a way to, to get these things out in the world. So we acted basically as a reseller. I see. And I helped him make a batch of 45 of 'em one summer week. But, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That was like, that, those had become sort of like the standard part of the standard rigging of laptop orchestras. That's where I mostly saw them in play. You know, every laptop orchestra would have one of these, floor sitting hemispheric speakers in front of each performer kind of making it so that it seemed like the sound was coming from the performer instead of just like, you know, some stereo pair of speakers behind everybody. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>Yeah. I mean, there's, there's that aspect of it. There's also the aspect that they just look cool <laugh> and all the crap you throw, I mean, which I don't think should be, yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1778.785" data-end_ts="1779.075" title="1778.785" id=c_"1778.785">__That__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1779.075" data-end_ts="1779.395" title="1779.075" id=c_"1779.075">__played__</span> because like all the crap you throw on stage is part of your performance. Right. And you know, I kind of like, I hate random wires and random crap on the stage, but like, if you have one of these hemispheric speakers, it seems like it's intentional and it's supposed to be part of the art. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's a good point. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>And then if you're playing with live performers, they, they seem to blend so much better because the sound's radiating in all directions and you can have it up there on the stage near the performer. It's not like the performer's in the center of the stage and the sound is like this disembodied stuff coming out from 50 feet on either side of the performer. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I had a, I had a chance to use those a fair bit, both with the Boulder laptop orchestra as well as just some guest spots that I did. And one of the things I noticed in, I, it was interesting the way that people would interact with each other when they were using hemispheric speakers. It seemed like the reason that things were blending is because I no longer felt like I had to like goose my volume to find out if that was really me coming out to speaker. Right. I could, I could instead, if I was too loud, I couldn't hear anybody else. And so that would be sort of like a detriment to me as a player, and I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1855.955" data-end_ts="1856.075" title="1855.955" id=c_"1855.955">__would__</span> naturally want to turn down it had the right kinda reward punishment system <laugh> for <span style="color:red" data-ts="1862.635" data-end_ts="1862.755" title="1862.635" id=c_"1862.635">__a__</span> artist, in a way that was really useful, I thought. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>Yeah, definitely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So now, yet another thing that you did during this time period or maybe shortly thereafter is start working on, these kind of like musical device frameworks. And I am, it's falling outta my head, but, now you're, now you're still involved in the JAM project. We interviewed Tron <span style="color:red" data-ts="1887.835" data-end_ts="1888.035" title="1887.835" id=c_"1887.835">__SES__</span> a while ago about it, but you're involved with that. But what was the predecessor to that? I can't remember 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>The, there was this standalone app I made with Max called Jade. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Jade. That's the one I was trying to think of. Yes. Yeah. And, yeah, that was sort of like a bunch of modules that you could kind of, that were predefined and then Jam is like an open source, open framework spin off of that. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>Yeah. So what happened is I had all these, I made all these modules for Jade, and then I had this standalone app that would kind of script them into place and automate them Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> over the course of time, so that I could get through my various pieces of music that I was trying to do, do things like turn off the D Fs p processing of things not used and that type of stuff. So, Tron had me over to Norway. This was back in, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1947.465" data-end_ts="1947.685" title="1947.465" id=c_"1947.465">__oh__</span>, my memory memory's starting to fade now, maybe 2003 or thereabouts. Okay. And, and I gave some talks and presentations of it, and then <span style="color:red" data-ts="1957.365" data-end_ts="1957.485" title="1957.365" id=c_"1957.365">__TRO__</span> was like, so, so Jade is great, but the really, important thing about this is this modular framework and it really should be open sourced. We should really ought to be like this system for programming these things, for creating these things so that they can interop, interoperate and also so that you can collaborate with other people more effectively. And so I thought about that and I agreed with him and Jim Oma was born. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So has that really been going for like 13 years then, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>Or <span style="color:red" data-ts="1989.925" data-end_ts="1990.285" title="1989.925" id=c_"1989.925">__couple__</span>? Well, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1990.925" data-end_ts="1991.045" title="1990.925" id=c_"1990.925">__first__</span> years or how 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Long did it take you to get started with just building the framework out? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>It was a great idea, but I had a lot of, a lot a lot going on. Okay. And in 2005 is really when it, it took off <span style="color:red" data-ts="2006.195" data-end_ts="2006.685" title="2006.195" id=c_"2006.195">__because__</span>, so it kind of like sat there not mo going anywhere real fast for a while. And, I had a really, sort of depressing job interview for an academic position at Cornell University. And, I needed something to distract myself on the flight home. And somehow I started working on what's now <span style="color:red" data-ts="2032.565" data-end_ts="2032.785" title="2032.565" id=c_"2032.565">__gym__</span> on that flight. And so I sent Tron an email. I was like, Hey <laugh>, you wanna get going on this? And he was like, yeah, now's a, now's a perfect time. And so That's awesome. So got kicked off. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Tell us like the genesis of it and where, where it's at now, where, where do you think of it as now? I mean, is it, is it max based or is it, has it been genericized? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>It is somewhat genericized. Okay. So there, there are different parts of, there's a lot of different tentacles to it. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and, everything operates at sort of like there's a, this underlying framework in c plus plus that makes all of everything happen. And then there's max wrappers for all of those objects. And there's also pure data wrappers for not all of them, but for some of them. And I don't use Pure data so much, so I can't speak to exactly what the status of the peer data side of things is, but, and then there are also people that just use the c plus plus part directly. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. There's some guys in France that have done a bunch of game engine development with it. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>In terms of the MAX package, I mean it, we worked on it for like 10 years before we released version 1.0. It wasn't like we were moving things along slowly either. We, we were getting together once, sometimes twice a year for a week 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Uhhuh 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>Over in Europe and hacking on things. And, probably most projects <span style="color:red" data-ts="2131.625" data-end_ts="2131.845" title="2131.625" id=c_"2131.625">__it__</span> call it version four or five, but <laugh>, you know, we, we kept the version number low so we could break everything <laugh>. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Give you <span style="color:red" data-ts="2140.305" data-end_ts="2140.525" title="2140.305" id=c_"2140.305">__the__</span> freedom. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>Which, which we did many times 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>But we put 1.0 on it and I mean, it really is as stable as as you could ever hope for. And it's been used in a lot of projects and 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, you know, you mentioned again, c plus plus. What's your fascination with c plus plus? I would think that, you know, with your experience doing, doing performances and, and all this kind of stuff, that you would be more focused on the tactical process of getting something on stage. But it seems like you're actually moving farther away from the stage and more into the, the tool development part of things. And, that's kind of surprising given your background. Is that why, why make that choice? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>So that's a really good question and I don't know if I'm prepared to, to give a coherent answer on that. Okay. But, but I am always, interested in systems, so, and how parts work together and that's true musically. That's true engineering wise. And so, putting together some sort of system of things is more interesting to me than, maybe making just like a monolithic beast to get through a performance or something. Sure. I dunno if that's an adequate 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>Answer or not, but 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It helps, it helps understand. I mean, you don't, you don't do electro tap or any of that kind of work anymore, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>Yeah. It just became too much. And, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2252.915" data-end_ts="2253.135" title="2252.915" id=c_"2252.915">__as__</span> I have two kids now and, and I exercise now, I didn't exercise in my twenties <laugh> and, and yeah. I need to do that to be healthy. Sure. And there's yeah, a lot, just a lot to do and, had to, it was really hard to let <span style="color:red" data-ts="2277.095" data-end_ts="2277.215" title="2277.095" id=c_"2277.095">__Electra__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2277.215" data-end_ts="2277.415" title="2277.215" id=c_"2277.215">__tap__</span> go. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'll bet. Well, because that was, that was really kind of the leverage out of school into, into a professional career world. Right. That's, that's gotta be hard to walk away from. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>Yeah. A lot of my ego is wrapped up in it. And, but yeah, I mean, and actually Electro <span style="color:red" data-ts="2299.525" data-end_ts="2299.815" title="2299.525" id=c_"2299.525">__Tech__</span> was the reason when I was trying, working on still trying to get academic position. A lot of those schools, the reason they were interested in interviewing me when there weren't very many composition jobs open was because I had this experience with business and they're thinking like well 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Maker stuff too. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>Yeah. I mean, this was a little before the Maker stuff took off. Mm. Okay. But they, but they were all thinking like, if we could find some other way to get money coming in the door, because, you know, this whole technology transfer idea, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. Everybody wanted to hire the next John Chowning. Right. We want, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>We want the next John Chowning. Right. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh man. That's crazy. Well man, we've burned through the time already, but, I wanna stay on track here for a little longer. So now it, so you sort of explained, you know, why moving away from the stage a little bit, why c plus plus, again, there are so many things and so many things that are like current and hot and groovy languages. Why are you focusing on c plus plus 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>C and c plus plus are still the way that most people are writing DSP software for audio? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and I care about audio first and foremost. Okay. So <span style="color:red" data-ts="2386.605" data-end_ts="2386.825" title="2386.605" id=c_"2386.605">__the__</span>, yes, you can do audio with a lot of these JavaScript things and web browsers and stuff on the backend. A lot of those, what they're doing is they're translating stuff into C or c plus plus. Right? Right. So that they can run this stuff fast enough because of my audio orientation. It's a natural fit also. That's where I've spent my time working for the last however many years. And I've, I've gotten to the point where that's where I'm, I feel the most fluent and the most proficient. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure, sure. That makes a lot of sense. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>There's a lot of things historically that have been super annoying about c plus plus in particular, but the modern versions of c plus plus are really addressing a lot of the ugliness and gotchas of the, of the old ways. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So I have a peculiar question, but it's one that happens to be in my head right today, actually. Tomorrow I'm supposed to go to a high school and talk to a bunch of music students about careers in music and technology. One of the things that I find difficult is being able to translate what I went through in order to get in the industry into what I can express to them about possibilities of getting into, into things. Right. I'm curious if you have any insights about, about how you might suggest people who want to become the next you. How do they do that? I mean, do they focus on engineering? Do they focus on hardware? Is it just like, don't bother, there's nothing here. What do you think is the, what do you think is the, the vision for people who want to do what you're doing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>Well, I don't know what the vision is for people that wanna do what I'm doing, but I know what I did. And I mean, what I did is the same thing that I think most artists or musicians do, which is that you don't plan on having one thing, be your entire pie. You gotta find a bunch of different pieces and try to put together a whole pie, hopefully <laugh>. So, I mean, what I was doing, I mean, I was writing software. I had tap tools for example, and I was selling that and I was getting meager royalty checks from ASCAP and I was doing music copying and finale, you know, for people that wanted their, their music input into the computer so it could be printed out. Right. And I was doing, helping people with max patches and I was teaching adjunct, you know, one class at the Kansas City Yard Institute and one class at UMKC and just try to put together enough things. 
</p>

<b>Tim: </b>Eventually I had some, you know, consulting for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_%2774">Cycling '74</a> which I was super appreciative of. But I mean, all that time, you know, you're still always looking and still, and eventually, I mean, in my case, one of those pieces became big enough that I didn't, it became the whole pie and now the whole pie is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_%2774">Cycling '74</a> But I had to put together a whole bunch of different pieces and, and they were all diverse, you know, eventually one took over. But I think that's the typical artist way to, to put together a, a living and 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Put together a career. Right. Yeah. That's actually a really, that's a, that's an important and good point. I appreciate that. Now, the other thing I want to ask you, because you know, because you <span style="color:red" data-ts="2604.965" data-end_ts="2605.085" title="2604.965" id=c_"2604.965">__worked__</span> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_%2774">Cycling '74</a> but specifically because you're on the development side and you know, you're building things right? And, and you get to see from a technical standpoint the direction that things are moving. What is your vision for the future of Mus the music industry and very specifically the music software thing? Where, where is that going? Because on one hand it looks like, well, hey, everyone's gonna get to be a programmer, but at some point it's like, yeah, but you still need people that are focused on the artistry rather than coding. Right. So there's a thing there, you know, where where do you see the future of sort of like art and technology and all that interaction? Where do you think that that's going? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>I have absolutely no idea. <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Well, you're, you're no help 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b><laugh>. No, I'm not any help. I mean, I, I, I have asked myself the question, I just have no idea whatsoever. Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's <laugh> That's interesting. But maybe that's, maybe that's the healthiest approach because I think if you're not, if you're not sure, then maybe you're not gonna jump to jump to early conclusions. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>Right. I mean, in some ways I feel like there's so much breadth of musical practice that, I'm still learning things that are really old school things. Right. As an example, there was something that you did in the beep videos for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_%2774">Cycling '74</a> recently, where you were like, oh, I'm gonna use a separate envelope generator on this, on the cutoff frequency than the gain, and I'm just gonna shorten this one up a little bit. And it was like, it's like, wow, that is just like, I never knew that little trick before 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Yeah. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>Okay. I mean, and it's just a little trick, but those little tricks, I mean, that makes a big difference in the, the musical output of the thing. And I'm still learning old stuff, you know, I'm not necessarily thinking that some new thing is coming down the road that's gonna change my life anymore than learning the old thing. It's a, it's a kind of a strange dichotomy to be developing stuff that's sort of like the bleeding edge software, but then also with eyes toward the past at the same time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Do you still do performances or work with performers at all? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>It's been, Hmm. How long has it been? I think it's been five years since I did a performance. Oh, wow. After having the second kid got more challenging and that, that last performance was fun. I'm starting to get, back to the point where I would like to perform again. Also starting 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>To get the 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>Again, also, I also, yeah, I mean I kind of burned out a little bit. I was really, as a perfectionist about a lot of things, which means you're holding yourself to a high standard, but usually you're holding other people to the same ridiculous, stupid standard. And I got to the point where it was hard for me to enjoy music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Ah, I see. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2788.245" data-end_ts="2788.465" title="2788.245" id=c_"2788.245">__To__</span> honest. It's like this year I've listened to more music than I probably have in the previous five combined. Interesting. It's like the joy of it has come back. Who's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Got, who's got your ear right now? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>Well, I just went to a Seager Roast concert. Uhhuh. I know they're not like the, they're not new, but, you know. No, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's pretty incredible 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>Though. It's pretty incredible to go to a Seager Roast concert. Yeah. They only come through here once every few years. Sure. So I've been digging up all the old Seager roast stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Nice, nice. Well, Tim, I wanna thank you so much for taking the time and having a chat for kind of talking about not only your history, but how that path looked and how it felt. You know, that's the one thing I like is when people kind of express not only what they did, but how they felt when it was going on. 'cause that that could be sometimes hard to keep clear. Right. So I appreciate that. So with that then I'm gonna say goodbye. Have a, have a great rest of your day, man. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b>Okay. Well thank you Darwin. I really appreciated spending time with you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, thanks a lot. Catch you later.
</p>

<p>
<b>Tim: </b> Mm-Hmm.
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Many thanks to Tim for his time talking over things. It's really interesting to hear about what it feels like working on your PhD, what it feels like, kind of, trying to find a way to get that trickle <span style="color:red" data-ts="2869.205" data-end_ts="2869.365" title="2869.205" id=c_"2869.205">__and__</span> nickels going. Very interesting stuff. I wanna also thank you the listeners for keeping on, keeping on with me. Got some really exciting stuff coming up in the next couple of weeks. So this is all because you guys have stuck with me over the years. I want to thank you so much for it. With that, I'm gonna sign off for the day. Have a good one. Bye.
