<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, today I have the great joy of being able to talk to somebody. My friend Mark Moser has been banging on me to get, get together with this guy. He moved to Denver a little bit before I moved out. He's an incredible influence to a lot of people. And, just within my friends in, Denver has already become a great influence there. His name is Dino, JA Dean, and he is by his own admission on his website. He does lots of things. So rather than me try and fill in the blanks, I'm gonna let him talk about it. So, with that, I'll say hi to Dino. Hi, Dino. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino J. A. Deane: </b>I'm good, Darwin How are you today? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm great. Having a good day today. Thanks so much for asking. So let's kick this off by having you sort of like self-identify yourself, tell people what you are and what you do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>Okay. I can, that's an interesting question, <laugh>. I, I've been a musician all my life, but I don't think I identify with that anymore. I'm an artist that works with sound and I've played a number of instruments during my life, acoustic instruments and electronic instruments, and I just love working with sound, whether it comes from an acoustic source or an electronic source, or rec or recordings of acoustic sounds. I just find that all fascinating. And yeah, I think that's how identi I identify now is just I'm an artist that works with sound. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's a great way of putting in a great kind of moniker, because that does kind of leave the door open for a lot of different implementations of that as a concept, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>Yeah. 'cause I mean, you know, we, I mean, all you have to do is look at EDM, for example, and there it, within that one overall genre, there are like so many sub genres of that, you know, and I've just, I've been doing this for such a long time and, and I've just kind of gotten bored with having to call something, something, you know, in order, which ultimately is just about getting what <span style="color:red" data-ts="153.235" data-end_ts="153.525" title="153.235" id=c_"153.235">__been__</span> in the record store your stuff is put in, you know? I mean, that's really what it comes down to. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, you're right about that. Now, one of the things, one of the ways that you play with sound, though, is a particular interest to me because it, it's affected friends of mine, like Victoria Lundy and Mark Mosher and some of these other folks, which is that you are a proponent and a practicer of the conduction system, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>This is true. I had the, I had the good fortune of, working with Butch Morris, who developed conduction, which conduction is a way of organizing a large group of musicians to create sonic composition in the moment, using hand gestures. So there's no written music, there's no structures or concepts talked about prior. Once you learn the vocabulary, it's really about composing in the moment. When I moved to, I moved to New York in 81, 80, 81, I went to New York with a punk rock band called Indoor Life, and I was playing, I was playing, trombone, but I had a, this is all, you know, this is eighties, this is like pre midi, right? I was, I was driving analog synthesizers with a pitch to voltage converter on my trombone, and I was in this punk band, and we went to New York and kind of set up a base of operation there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>We had come from San Francisco, and when I got to New York, I, I got very involved in the downtown improvised music scene and played with a number of musicians there. But to specifically to what we're focusing on right now, one of the people I met was Butch Morris, who's a, who was a, a wonderful <span style="color:red" data-ts="274.825" data-end_ts="275.245" title="274.825" id=c_"274.825">__cornet__</span> player. I started with working with him, and when he had just started conduction, I mean, he had been developing it for several years, but I remember going to see the, the very first numbered conduction, I think it was February 1st, 1985, I believe, okay. At the kitchen. And, he invited me to come and watch this concert, this thing he was doing called Conduction, which I had no clue what that meant. And I went and watched him, and I was in, in the audience, and I was thinking to myself, this guy is doing the same thing that I do with sample samples and samplers only he's doing it with real musicians. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>Yeah. So it's this really fascinating way. It's a vocabulary of signs that are basically, they're kind of like pictographs in a way. Like hand <span style="color:red" data-ts="331.625" data-end_ts="331.845" title="331.625" id=c_"331.625">__ge__</span> hand <span style="color:red" data-ts="332.225" data-end_ts="332.445" title="332.225" id=c_"332.225">__ge__</span> hand gestures that, that create a sign. And they're basically the fundamental building blocks of music. There's one sign that means to repeat something. There's one sign that means to make a continuous sound. And so there's about, I don't know, I all toll, I think there's about 40 or 45 signs, and you can construct musical composition using this. And so, anyway, I, I started working with Butch first as a trombone player, and then I said, you know, I'd like to do live sampling with the ensemble because I think it would, would be a natural kind of extension of what you're already doing. Right? And, and he totally got it. I mean, he totally got it. And, you know, you gotta remember that, you know, back in 81, 82 live sampling wasn't even a word, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>I mean, it, it, it didn't exist. And, and there were very few, I mean, you certainly weren't seeing computers at that point in time. We're talking straight up hardware. There were some <span style="color:red" data-ts="399.275" data-end_ts="399.565" title="399.275" id=c_"399.275">__loop__</span> looper pedals, very few. But I'm talking about actually using a hardware sampler and recording in concert what musicians were playing and looping that in the old school hardware way and getting it back into the mix in real time, right? Within a compositional structure that moves incredibly fast. I mean, we're not talking about long slow moving, you know, drone soundscapes. We're talking about things that can, can go from pointillistic to solo to, completely orchestrated out to, you know, virtually go anywhere in the time it takes to give a downbeat. It was <laugh> a a a challenging ride, to say the least. But it, it worked really well with in the context of conduction, because it was just this kind of, it felt very organic because here was this stuff that was happening in the moment based on musicians interpreting these signs and then creating a musical response to these signs. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>And then I was grabbing things and, you know, flipping them around and throwing them back into the mix. And then, you know, he might do something like have someone, I may sample something from, something one of the drummers is doing, and set that up as a counter rhythm, and he may tell the string section to repeat what I'm doing, uhhuh <affirmative>. And then the whole string section becomes this interpretation of what I've come up with from a sample of what the drummer did. And then he cuts everybody off. And now the string section is basically doing what the drummer was originally doing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. All right. It's gonna take me a second to just sort of like, collect my jaw from the floor and pull it back up, because what you just laid out was the seed pods of about 20 different whole areas of inquiry. So let's, let's talk a little bit about each. So first of all, this method of conduction, so Butch Morriss put, pulled this together. The signals that he use are, they're consistent, right? They, they are sort of like predefined signals, so it's not like he's making it up on the <span style="color:red" data-ts="553.365" data-end_ts="553.565" title="553.365" id=c_"553.365">__fly__</span>. This is all predefined symbols, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>Yeah. He, he's created a vocabulary and, you know, there's a number of, this is not new in history, right? I mean, this goes way back. And you look at, you look at the, the kind of the icons of this, you know, Frank Zappa was doing this to, to an extent, sun <span style="color:red" data-ts="574.085" data-end_ts="574.165" title="574.085" id=c_"574.085">__Rah__</span> was doing this to an extent, right? There's, there's a, a Leonard Bernstein album from the sixties called, I think it's three or four improvisations, and he was using some kind of signing with the orchestra, and they were creating music with no music, so no written music. So Butch came up with a system, and it's fascinating, one of, one of his statements, he said, you know, Butch was involved in jazz and also composition and arranging. And he had moved to New York in the seventies when the downtown kind of free jazz loft scene was happening. And there were these energy orchestras where these large, ensembles would to get together and, and basically play free. And he would, he, he asked himself this question, you know, here, here's some amazing moment that the music got to, and how could I bring that back? You know, how could I bring this back? And so one of the signs is if there's something happening and you point to your <span style="color:red" data-ts="643.255" data-end_ts="643.605" title="643.255" id=c_"643.255">__under__</span> and then hold up a one digit, you're basically saying to the ensemble that what is happening right now is memory one. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>And so, so you have to not only remember what you're playing, but you have to remember how it is interacting with the other players. And it isn't just the notes, it's the attitude. It's the intensity. It's the volume. And so five minutes into later where the music could be someplace completely different, you touch your head, hold up that one finger again, drop it down, and the whole ensemble goes back to that place 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>And so it, it's, so there's about 45 signs that have very specific meanings, but they're, they're, the reason I say they're kind of like, they're iconic meanings. They're not overly defined. If, if the meaning of the sign is to repeat something, what you repeat is up to you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Got it. Okay. It, it's interesting to me because it really does seem to, I mean, the process of pulling together these signs and sort of the interaction must have been a grueling process because finding things that help you sort of like generate the sonic material you're hoping to create while simultaneously honoring the fact that you have an, a master <span style="color:red" data-ts="735.665" data-end_ts="735.885" title="735.665" id=c_"735.665">__of__</span> improvisation actually playing the thing. It seems like it's a, it would be difficult to come up with a methodology that allows that sort of like, allows both to coexist. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>That's a, it's, it's a great question because there's another system that was developed that's sound painting. Walter Thompson developed sound painting at the same period of time that Butch was developing, conducting. And neither one of them, this is, this is what the story is. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, neither one of them knew what the other one was doing. <laugh>. I find that a little hard to believe. Yeah. But, but I, I, I think it's, I think it's probably more accurate to say that neither one of them looked at what the other one was doing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>You know what I mean? I think, I think, I think they were both so focused on developing their systems that they didn't wanna look at anyone else's right. Way of looking at it. You know what I'm saying? Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Absolutely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>But what's fascinating to me is Walter's system, I think, I think he's got something like 1200 signs. Oh 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>My God. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>Yeah. So he took a tact of more and more signs, and some of the signs in sound painting are very, very divine defined, very defined. Okay. Butch took, Butch took like a almost zen-like approach to it. And so the signs in conduction are iconic in that they represent the building blocks of music, but they are not overly defined as to imply any kind of stylistic behavior. Right. And the way that Butch describes it is that as the conductor in an, in a conduction ensemble is responsible for structure Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and the musicians within a conduction ensemble are responsible for content. So if I go up there and hold up a sign, I have something in my head that I would repeat. But when I give that downbeat, I have no idea what's gonna come back at me. And it's like, it's like someone takes a big, huge blob of sonic clay and throws it down right in front of you, and then you, as the conductor has to shape, have to shape it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>Right. And, and it's, it's really fascinating. I mean, you, you have, as the conductor, you have no idea what, and so if you go, so what it really comes down to, and, and this is interesting, like I've been, I worked with Butch as a musician for 28 years, and he was one of my best friends on the planet. And I have been conducting for, 19 years now. And what I've come to realize is the only choice, the only decision that I make is the, is what the first sign is gonna be. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I hold up that sign, and the musicians interpret that and create a sonic manifestation. And it's that sonic manifestation that then tells me or conducts me as what the next sign needs to be. So what <span style="color:red" data-ts="946.765" data-end_ts="946.885" title="946.765" id=c_"946.765">__it__</span>, what happens is, it's like you can't think in conduction, you know, you can't analyze, you can't go up into the mind kind of way of looking at things because it's about being in the moment. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>And if you, if you're analyzing the moment's gone and you're, you're playing catch up, and then in the process, you're missing the next moment and then <span style="color:red" data-ts="970.845" data-end_ts="971.045" title="970.845" id=c_"970.845">__miss__</span> and missing the next moment. So it's really, it's your first response and you have to basically just jump off the roof and go. And once you do that, this feedback loop happens where it goes from the symbolic to the sonic and back to the symbolic and the sonic. And there's this energetic feedback loop that happens. And at a certain point, you're in the middle of this piece, and it's kind of like <span style="color:red" data-ts="1000.185" data-end_ts="1000.405" title="1000.185" id=c_"1000.185">__an__</span> out <span style="color:red" data-ts="1000.645" data-end_ts="1000.765" title="1000.645" id=c_"1000.645">__of__</span> body experience where you kind of realize that you're not making any decisions. You just from moment to moment appear to be doing the appropriate thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. That's, well, it's funny because as you were describing it, the concept of the feedback loop is what was bouncing around in my head too. It's, it's clear that that kind of loop is really intrinsic and important in this kind of environment. But also, you know, you talk about having this background doing live sampling, which there's something, so, like when you were describing this thing of like, representing, you know, memory 0.1, I mean, that's almost like either capturing a sample that you're gonna trigger later or setting a preset or something. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>Exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Like, you know, now when we think of doing live sampling, there is a certain amount of chance involved if you're really doing it live, which is that you capture stuff and you don't, aren't always necessarily precisely on great loop points or whatever. But so often those are, those are the things that really, that really speak because it's, it's more of emotional choices being made rather than intellectual choices. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>I completely agree. And I think that's, that's a, yeah, I totally agree with that. You know, I, I have been such a, a proponent of, I come from an acoustic background Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I come from, I've done a lot of free improvisation and a lot of things where the concept of midi clock and sinking and things like that are just completely inappropriate to Right. To where you're at. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1108.145" data-end_ts="1108.365" title="1108.145" id=c_"1108.145">__It__</span>, it just doesn't, it doesn't work. It, it, it creates a different kind of music. And there's nothing wrong with the kind of music it creates, but it, it, it locks you in a, into a certain way of looking at time. Right. I've been a big proponent of using technology in acoustic more poly and pan <span style="color:red" data-ts="1130.525" data-end_ts="1131.045" title="1130.525" id=c_"1130.525">__rhythmic__</span> situations. And I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1134.085" data-end_ts="1134.285" title="1134.085" id=c_"1134.085">__wi__</span> I wish more people were exploring that because I think we get with technology, especially with some of the, what I think of as the four on the floor kind of music where everything is lockte together. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, the, the potential of what can happen rhythmically and sonically, and how an an amazingly detailed soundscape can, once you lock it to a certain rhythmic point of view, that's the only way you experience that soundscape. And if you, if you remove it from that rhythmic lock, you can experience it in many, many more ways. And so I've just always been an advocate of, of using technology. And, and, you know, I have to tell you back, you know, back in the day when I first started doing live sampling, I would have to be, because a lot of these ensembles were coming from a jazz perspective, a classical perspective, a world music perspective. And I would ask, before we would play if there was anyone in the ensemble who did not want to be sampled Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And there were people who were extremely adamant about that because this whole thing with lawsuits and, sample libraries were just beginning. And there were people, acoustic musicians who were very, threatened by this. Yeah. That basically I was gonna, there were sounds, and so I would always ask the ensemble, and there were some people who did not wanna be sampled, and so I would not put up mics in front of those people. Sure. And, it, it, I mean, it was just a very, very different time period. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. It was, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>But <span style="color:red" data-ts="1250.625" data-end_ts="1250.845" title="1250.625" id=c_"1250.625">__at__</span>, but it, you know, it's fascinating at the people who got it where, where they would be playing, and I would grab something they would play and manipulate it and throw it back and, and they would like discover like, wow, this is cool. I can play off of this. You know? And very few people at that time were, were doing live looping and stuff. Right. I mean, you know, that that wasn't, so people, you know, musicians, acoustic musicians were just kind of learning about how technology could work in these kind of situations coming from a completely different place than, than the where, where things are today. Where it's just, it's a given. You know, you don't s think twice a laptop on stage or <span style="color:red" data-ts="1294.125" data-end_ts="1294.325" title="1294.125" id=c_"1294.125">__loop__</span> pedals or, you know, any instrument being hooked up to some kind of, you know, technology 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Back in the day when, you know, you would kind of approach people and say, is it cool to sample? Did you ever get situations where people <span style="color:red" data-ts="1308.215" data-end_ts="1308.565" title="1308.215" id=c_"1308.215">__there__</span> initially would be like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1309.685" data-end_ts="1309.885" title="1309.685" id=c_"1309.685">__no__</span>, I don't want you to do it. And then they would see how it went with somebody else and kind of come back and be like, well, if you wanna put up a mic, you can go ahead, <laugh>. Did you get, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1318.425" data-end_ts="1318.645" title="1318.425" id=c_"1318.425">__did__</span> you kinda like evangelize the concept? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>Yeah, no, I mean, once they, once they, you know, and the other thing that I always told them, and it was true once a concert was over or a session was over, I never saved anything that, that I, any live sampling I did if I wanted to, if I wanted to make samples, you know, I would take my cassette recorder At the time, at the time, you know, I had a TCD five M, which was that, was it the Sony TCD at that point in time, that was, that was the ship. So if I wanted to collect samples, I would go out and collect samples, you know, if I was making a library to playback for a specific project Right. I would do that. But anything, when I started doing live sampling, it was gone. When the concert ended, I never saved anything. So I so people could trust the fact that I was not going to, you know, steal whatever they contributed in the concert. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It was in the moment, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>It was in the moment, and the only recording was of the whole ensemble. Right. You know, there wasn't there, I didn't have like this stash of, of their sounds that I was <span style="color:red" data-ts="1394.405" data-end_ts="1394.645" title="1394.405" id=c_"1394.405">__gonna__</span> use in other projects. Right. It was, it was really, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1399.435" data-end_ts="1399.725" title="1399.435" id=c_"1399.435">__grow__</span> coming through that whole era of sampling it. There was a, it's just not what you think of today, you know, it was just, yeah. Just a whole different thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So what sampler, what sampler hardware were you using at <span style="color:red" data-ts="1414.365" data-end_ts="1414.485" title="1414.365" id=c_"1414.365">__that__</span> time? What was, what was the thing that would work best in a live environment? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>Well, the, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1419.665" data-end_ts="1419.885" title="1419.665" id=c_"1419.665">__on__</span> the only things that I found worked, the first hardware sampler that I was using, I first started, you know, I had a, a Roland, 3 0 1 Chorus Echo, which was a tape loop thing with sound on sound. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And so I was using that for live looping and, you know, that kind of sound on <span style="color:red" data-ts="1443.685" data-end_ts="1443.925" title="1443.685" id=c_"1443.685">__sound__</span> kind of stuff. Sure. When, Mike Matthews at, at Electro Harmonics came out with the 16 second DDL Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Right. Which was the, you know, the, that, in my opinion, that was the box that, that changed everything, that particular box. I mean, you look at, you look at, Nels Klein, you look at <span style="color:red" data-ts="1467.165" data-end_ts="1467.725" title="1467.165" id=c_"1467.165">__Frizzell__</span>, just two ex examples of people who, whose whole concept and whole sound was based on that box. And I think of, of any of the kind of milestones of things that really put things in a different direct direction, it was that the 16 second DDL, but the first, like full featured, you know, sampler that I found you could do live sampling with was the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1499.205" data-end_ts="1499.425" title="1499.205" id=c_"1499.205">__AKI__</span> S 900. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>That was that two, what was it, a four space rack, right. White. It was the first 12 bit sampler. It was the fir and it sampled at 40, 40 k mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I think, I think, you know, it used fluffy disk and I think you had, it was either 12 seconds or 14 seconds. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>Right. You know, you know, I was working with, John Hassell's band and I was working with, we had the in Sonic Mirage Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know, which was that <laugh> that, I mean, that thing put sampling on the map. Right. You know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That was my first sampler 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>At $1,500. Yeah. Are you kidding me? Everything else, the closest thing you could get to that was the, emulator too. And that was like something like eight grand or something. Yeah. You know, that's crazy. So when they came out with the Mirage, but you could not do live sampling on the Mirage <span style="color:red" data-ts="1557.235" data-end_ts="1557.585" title="1557.235" id=c_"1557.235">__would__</span>, did it have two seconds 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>? <span style="color:red" data-ts="1559.385" data-end_ts="1559.665" title="1559.385" id=c_"1559.385">__Yeah__</span>. Two seconds and everything was done with a two digit display. Yeah. Actually, I can't even imagine that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>Yeah. So that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1566.625" data-end_ts="1566.825" title="1566.625" id=c_"1566.625">__was__</span>, you couldn't use that. We were, I was using that in Hassel's band as a, you know, playback right device, but the first like actual physical sampler that you could do live sampling on, in my opinion, was the S 900. So I was using that, and then it was like, what, a year after that, the, the, the S 900 came out <span style="color:red" data-ts="1589.605" data-end_ts="1589.825" title="1589.605" id=c_"1589.605">__and__</span>, and I think it was in 86 it came out, and then in 88 in Sonic came out with the EPS Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And then, and then two years later was the 16 plus, and then two years later was the as SR 10. And those were the machines you could do, man, I had a, I had an EPSI had the 16 plus and the as SR 10, and I mean, what EPS was in Sonic Performance sampler. And you could live sample on those machines and you could be playing back while you were sampling. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>And that was something that none of the other machines could do. All the other sample samplers that were out there, including the, a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1640.505" data-end_ts="1640.725" title="1640.505" id=c_"1640.505">__kai__</span> was when you were sampling that over, that took the machine over, you could not, you could not be playing anything while you sampled anything that's not a very real time friendly <laugh> piece of technology. <laugh>. So the in gear was amazing because it had an unbelievable real <span style="color:red" data-ts="1663.885" data-end_ts="1664.085" title="1663.885" id=c_"1663.885">__time__</span> sequencer on it. Yep. It had incredible effects. It had, good, good solid bandwidth, and, and you could be sampling while you were playing back other samples. So I used those things, all through and, and every time they came out, plus the, that company was so like, considerate of their clientele. It's like when the e when the EPS 16 plus came out, all your discs from the EPS could be played on the 16 plus when the A SR 10 came out, all your discs all the way back to the EPS could be played on the Assr 10 and Assr 10. That was it. That was the, that was the shit, man, that, that 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Was, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1713.445" data-end_ts="1713.645" title="1713.445" id=c_"1713.445">__well__</span>, there's, there are still people that swear by that keyboard. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>Oh, yeah. I was doing a lot of traveling at that time. And, you know, the, the ASR 10 was a big keyboard, big anvil case. And I was, I had one too many experiences of getting off the plane in Berlin to do a concert and being told a baggage claim that my ASR 10 was still on the plane going to Madrid. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And it wasn't. And that's when I realized that if I was gonna continue doing this, I was gonna have to have a situation that I could walk on the plane with. Right. And that was, it was in 2002 that I finally made a very reluctant switch to a laptop. Right. But up until up until 2002, it was all hardware for me. And that specifically the a, the EPS <span style="color:red" data-ts="1770.905" data-end_ts="1771.325" title="1770.905" id=c_"1770.905">__series__</span>, the in Sonic series. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So I'm curious, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1774.185" data-end_ts="1774.405" title="1774.185" id=c_"1774.185">__the__</span>, you've weaved already several tails, whether it's, trombone, CV powered punk band player, <laugh>, or live sampler or conduction specialists that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1789.405" data-end_ts="1789.605" title="1789.405" id=c_"1789.405">__work__</span> directly with Butch Morriss. I mean, amazing tale of stuff. I, one of the things I like doing in my podcast is talking to people about how they got to be the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1798.845" data-end_ts="1799.085" title="1798.845" id=c_"1798.845">__artists__</span> that they are. Right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I am really curious, what is your background? What is the back, what is your musical background, your history of that, and especially how did you make the transition from whatever you initially learned to <span style="color:red" data-ts="1815.115" data-end_ts="1815.405" title="1815.115" id=c_"1815.115">__feel__</span> feeling comfortable in these really free, free scenarios? And believe me, I, I remember, and I'm still sort of in awe of that kind of New York timeframe where the, the definition of a punk band was not that much different from the loft jazz players, which wasn't that different from the noise bands. I mean, all these people lived in this milieu of daily experimentation Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But you had to get there from somewhere. And I'm curious about what that trek looks like. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>Okay. Well, my father was a musician. He played drums and he played bass. And he had, he grew up in Los Angeles, which is where I grew up. And he had, a big band, you know, in that forties style of big bands. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>And then he went into, got drafted, during World War ii, and he was a, a flight instructor. And when he got out of the service, he decided not to go back into music. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1887.545" data-end_ts="1887.765" title="1887.545" id=c_"1887.545">__He__</span>, and he went in into business. But as I was growing up, he was very, very, he was always introducing me to music. And his love was big band music and, new Orleans Jazz. Okay. And so I got exposed to that a very young age. I mean, in, I remember in grade school I was totally into, new Orleans style music and big bands. And then when I got into high school, all I was listening to was, and I, you know, I was like in a suburban white high school where everybody was listening to the Beach Boys. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I was listening to James Brown and Art Blakey and Miles Davis. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>That's all I listened to. Right. And, you know, completely <laugh> out of step with <laugh>, the rest of the kids at school. My father suggested that I learned to play the trombone. He had taught me rudiments. He was a, a drummer, and he still had a snare drum, and he taught me rudiments, on the drum. So I always had a fascination for percussion. And then I started playing, the trombone in school, just in the regular school program when they, when they like, actually had a musical program in school. And I was in the, you know, the marching band in the orchestra and, and all that stuff. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1972.765" data-end_ts="1972.885" title="1972.765" id=c_"1972.765">__I__</span> was probably a senior in high school, and I had a, a, a job in a music store. And I was, I was paying for private music lessons with this wonderful gentleman named Merv Kennedy, who taught theory. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>So I was learning, you know, theory, and I was way into big bands and, all the work, my favorite arranger was Gil Evans, who did all those large ensemble pieces for Miles Davis, sketches of Spain, Porgy, and Bess. And I would, I would just devour those things under the headphones just listening to the arrangements. I wanted to, I wanted to be a studio musician in la I wanted to play on other people's records and do commercials and stuff like that. And so I, out of high school, I got, I was, I got involved in a, in a funk band. And this was, you know, here's another experience that doesn't really exist, exist anymore today. This was an eight piece band, you know, guitar <span style="color:red" data-ts="2034.255" data-end_ts="2034.605" title="2034.255" id=c_"2034.255">__based__</span> drums. The keyboard player was playing a, one of those old wooden <span style="color:red" data-ts="2040.635" data-end_ts="2040.925" title="2040.635" id=c_"2040.635">__whir__</span> electric pianos and a Hammond B three. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>We had a, a woman singer and three horn players. And we played in dance clubs around Los Angeles and all through California and Alaska and Hawaii. And we played five sets a night, six nights a week. And we would go into a club for a minimum of two weeks and sometimes be in a club for two months that that experience doesn't really exist anymore. Right. And we played Sly James Brown. We were a funk band. So I was doing that at night, and then I was hooked up with this horn section called the LA Horns. So during the day I was doing studio sessions. Okay. And one of our clients was Ike Turner. And so we did a lot of recording for, for Ike, and actually went <span style="color:red" data-ts="2096.425" data-end_ts="2096.645" title="2096.425" id=c_"2096.425">__at__</span>, after Ike and Tina split up, I, she actually took the horn section from the studio band, and I went on tour with her for a year. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>And I was playing, I, I learned early on as a trombone player, the trombone in funk bands, the trombone would always be the last instrument hired to the horn section and the first one to go <laugh> if the finances got tight, you know? Right. Okay. And so I was doubling on percussion, flute keyboards, if I could cover more bases. Right. You <span style="color:red" data-ts="2133.205" data-end_ts="2133.285" title="2133.205" id=c_"2133.205">__could__</span> stick around longer. Yeah. So when I toured with Tina, I was playing trombone alto flute, clavet, and string synthesizer. Oh, brilliant. We had, we had a D six clavet, and I didn't have the Selena, I didn't have the arc string synthesizer. I had the, the crew <span style="color:red" data-ts="2152.225" data-end_ts="2152.445" title="2152.225" id=c_"2152.225">__mar__</span> the Remar orchestrator. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, which was that Italian one. Right. Which I, which I actually liked it better than the Selena. The Selena had a certain, it kind of was thin <span style="color:red" data-ts="2163.265" data-end_ts="2163.485" title="2163.265" id=c_"2163.265">__at__</span> a certain, a little whiny. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>Yeah. It was a little whiny. Yeah. <laugh>. But I, I kind of preferred the sound of the Kmar. It just seemed a little richer to me. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But anyway, I'll tell you, this was what the one, the thing that turned me out to electronic music was this. And, I was doing a, a, a, a studio session. It was a commercial. It was either a commercial or a horns on, on a pop song or something. And we were on a little break, and I was wandering around the studio, and I forget which studio it was, one of the studios in la I was wandering around the studio and I walked into this room and there was an arc 2,600 on, on the table. I had never seen an ARP 2,600 before I, this was about the same time, you know, the, the mini <span style="color:red" data-ts="2220.595" data-end_ts="2220.885" title="2220.595" id=c_"2220.595">__mood__</span> came out about the same time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>The ARP 2,600 came out about the same time. And I, and I sat down and I started, you know, turning knobs and hitting the keyboard and all these amazing sounds came out. And you know, it, you remember the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2238.725" data-end_ts="2238.845" title="2238.725" id=c_"2238.725">__R__</span> 2,600, it was the, the console part, and then the keyboard was separate. Right. And it had, it had that really bizarre looking cable that connected Right. Of being completely naive to what was actually going on. I, you know, made these wacky sounds come out, had no idea what I was doing. But the first thought that came through my mind when I looked and saw that there was just a plug that went from the keyboard to the box was, why couldn't I just make my trombone be the keyboard? Right. Can I just plug this thing into my trombone in some kind of way? And then that started me on the, my first, I tracked down, you remember 360 systems? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>Oh, I absolutely do. Yeah. I had one of their PP <span style="color:red" data-ts="2292.685" data-end_ts="2292.845" title="2292.685" id=c_"2292.685">__two__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2292.865" data-end_ts="2293.085" title="2292.865" id=c_"2292.865">__vs__</span>. Oh, wow. They were an l they were an LA company. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. This started me on, you know, I called up, you know, music stores and, you know, can I just plug my trombone into this synthesizer? Oh no. You need the pitch to voltage converter and blah, blah. And I, so I got a 360 Systems pitch to voltage converter. My first synthesizer that I actually owned, I had, I actually had a friend who had a, at this period of time, there was a lot of garage studios that were opening up, and they were usually centered around, one of those teac four tracks. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know, one of those old reel <span style="color:red" data-ts="2333.885" data-end_ts="2334.085" title="2333.885" id=c_"2333.885">__to__</span> reel TX 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>33 40 or something. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>Right? Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2337.085" data-end_ts="2337.805" title="2337.085" id=c_"2337.085">__33 40__</span>. Exactly. Lot of Garage Studios centered around that. And if you really got, into a high-end garage studio, they would have, the TX eight track. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And so I was trading with this guy knew who had a studio, and I would do keyboard overdubs, percussion overdubs, trombone, overdubs flute over doubs in exchange for having access to his studio late at night. And so he had an R 2,600, he had the, the TX four track. So I got kind of, that's how I learned about tracking and, and learning the synthesizer. But the first synthesizer I actually owned was, you remember Octave Plateau? You remember the cat? I do. Yeah. Yeah. I had an octave, plateau cat synthesizer. Oh <span style="color:red" data-ts="2391.965" data-end_ts="2392.165" title="2391.965" id=c_"2391.965">__my__</span> goodness. That, this guy in la, what was his name? Oh, I forget his name. But he, he would mod stuff and he modded the cat. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>So I could plug in the 360 systems, P two V mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And so I had a little transducer pickup in the, in the mouthpiece. And, and then I also had a, a mic in the bell. So I was using the transducer into the P two V to drive the cat. And then he had each of the oscillators on a foot switch so I could turn off each oscillator individually. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2432.885" data-end_ts="2433.165" title="2432.885" id=c_"2432.885">__They__</span> had two oscillators and then the noise generator. And I could turn each one of those things off individually. That was a very cool. So I could get, you know, 'cause you're playing an instrument that takes both your hands. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Right. So, you know, I, so you would set up your preset, and then I would add in the second oscillator to get, you know, harmonies. Right. And then I would a or I would cut off all the oscillators and just work with the noise generator. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>And then I had go, the bell had the microphone, and it was going through an old MXR distortion plus a a, which is that yellow mustardy looking gnarly, fuzzy sounding thing. And then a, it was going through a tron phaser, an A DA flanger, and then into the, ecco. And so it was a combination of the all those sounds. And I was still, you know, just totally in this head of either playing, you know, wacky ass funk music. I mean, the fir the first pedal I ever bought for my tro for my trombone was an electro harmonics, frequency analyzer. <laugh>. Because I had read the little ad and it said, you know, add harmonies <laugh>. Right, right. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Sometimes the promise of those ads <span style="color:red" data-ts="2518.105" data-end_ts="2518.325" title="2518.105" id=c_"2518.105">__in__</span> the actual result were pretty divergent 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b><laugh>. It does add harmonies, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Of a sort, <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>You just don't have a whole lot of control over them. <laugh>. So that's what got me into electronics and what got me into working with more, freer structures. 'cause when I was in la I, I, there was a huge free music scene in jazz scene in la, but I was not part of that. I was really in the funk scene and the Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and the studio musician scene. This is something I had wanted to do for, for all as I was growing up, was become the studio musician. And then as I was making my way up the food chain and getting on more sessions with a-list players, when we had, we would go on a break, all these guys wanted to talk about was golf. What it came to me was that I could be hanging out with plumbers or ca cabinet makers. Right. You know, that, that I was hanging with a, a very skilled group of musicians, but they didn't want to talk about music. You know what I mean? In <span style="color:red" data-ts="2590.605" data-end_ts="2590.765" title="2590.605" id=c_"2590.605">__terms__</span>, in terms of what I wanted to do with music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Do you think it was because they, by grinding it out every day, there was just no passion left to it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>I do. I, I, what what, what I realized at that point was this was an amazing job, and it was a truly amazing job because you had to walk in and read it down. And if, and the goal with every one of these cats was to get it in one. You know, that you would read it down, they would roll the tape, you would play it, and there would not be a second take. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> that you would so nail it on the first pass that that was it. Right. You know what I mean? That was the goal. And it was a very focused, highly demanding situation. But I think it was that, that, because this was the daily grind, there wasn't that sense of music is something bigger. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, and I can only speak for myself, but this was this, the, the, the a-list. Cats were the ones who were always looking at their watch, going from one session to the next, trying to get as many sessions in a, in a day as they could. And, and then when we were on a break, the, the topic of discussion was usually golf 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Run. Unreal. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>It was kind of this wake up call that I don't think this is the path I wanna continue on. Right. Nothing against that at all. I mean, these were, these were high, high end musicians. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>I moved up to San Francisco and I got involved in, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2689.665" data-end_ts="2689.885" title="2689.665" id=c_"2689.665">__in__</span> with the, the jazz scene up there, world music scene, the theater scene. That's when I started doing sound design and the free improvisation scene. And that really, it was what really turned me out in terms of working with a different way of structure and much more open Sure. Concepts for structure. But, but in all these situations, I wanted to bring the, electronics in to <span style="color:red" data-ts="2723.205" data-end_ts="2723.285" title="2723.205" id=c_"2723.205">__the__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2723.465" data-end_ts="2723.685" title="2723.465" id=c_"2723.465">__to__</span>, I wanted, I wanted to, to bring the technology with me. So, so I kind of honed my skills with electronics in situations where you weren't in a studio and there wasn't a click track, and there wasn't a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2741.845" data-end_ts="2742.125" title="2741.845" id=c_"2741.845">__sink__</span>. Right. So it was, it was kind of made you look at electronics in a very different way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, so like, when you made that move though, you went from being a professional musician, studio musician, that kind of environment didn't exist in San Francisco. And, you know, you were onto other things. Now, how did you make your way? How did you eat? Did you get enough gigs doing sound design for theater and stuff to be able to keep you in, in rice and beans 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>At that period of time? We're talking about mid seventies now. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> at that period of time, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2782.735" data-end_ts="2783.085" title="2782.735" id=c_"2782.735">__Sam's__</span> Francisco was a very inexpensive town. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>And, and I remember I was, I was living in a Victorian with three other people. I had my own, I had two rooms. There was a, a room where there was a piano where we had anybody who lived in the house could have rehearsed their band there. We all shared a living room and a kitchen and a bathroom. And I think my rent was $69 a month. You 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Know? Okay. So a whole generation just cried out loud as <laugh>. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>Oh, yeah. No, I don't know. I don't know how young people do it today. I really don't. I mean, you look at what's happened to New York, you look at what's happened to any of the major, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The great cities. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>The great cities. It's like, it's, it's impossible. I mean, the, the reason that there was the downtown scene in New York was because it was cheap to live downtown. Right. You know, I remember, you know, Butch, Butch lived on fifth between B and C and was it fifth or seventh? Might have been, might have been seventh. But he, he, when he moved into his building, that <span style="color:red" data-ts="2867.425" data-end_ts="2867.645" title="2867.425" id=c_"2867.425">__was__</span>, that side was when he, when he would, he told me when the first year that he lived in his building, when he would come out the door, he would never turn left and go to <span style="color:red" data-ts="2883.825" data-end_ts="2884.045" title="2883.825" id=c_"2883.825">__Bee__</span> ever. He would only turn Right. And go to sea. Those areas were very sketchy. And, you know, that's the thing. And now his, his son lives in, in that same building. And I remember, which was telling me, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2900.785" data-end_ts="2901.005" title="2900.785" id=c_"2900.785">__no__</span>, probably about a year before he passed, that he wanted to, to move somewhere else, but if he moved somewhere else, it would have to be out of New York. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>Yeah. Yeah. Because he couldn't, and I have a number of friends in New York who, who can't move from where they are because they would have to actually leave New York. And you look at everybody, there was that first big thing where everybody moved to Brooklyn, and now Brooklyn is just as expensive. Yeah, it is. It's unreal. It's, it's, it's insane. You know? I mean, so that's the thing. It's like, you know, when I was living in San, in San Francisco, it was inexpensive. I mean, I had, I, I played in a wedding band. It was a Salvadorian wedding band. There was this huge Salvadoran community in San Francisco, the Bay Area. So we would, on the weekends, we'd play one or two weddings on the weekends. And I was parking cars on Friday night in North Beach, and I could live on that. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. I could live on that Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>I played in a different band every night. And they weren't necessarily performing. I mean, that was the thing about San Francisco was there was this incredible, absolutely incredible underground activity going on in, in across multiple genres of music and, especially in free improvisation. And it <span style="color:red" data-ts="2987.285" data-end_ts="2987.445" title="2987.285" id=c_"2987.285">__would__</span>, and it would, I remember there was this joke that, you know, there would, there would be, nobody would be playing out. And then, then these little venues would pop up and you could start playing out. Right. And then just about the time that the Bay Guardian would come out with this article about the golden age of improvised music, you knew this scene was about to go underground again. Right, right. And it would cycle like that, you know. But what was fascinating about San Francisco that I found more, for me, much more interesting than when I lived in New York, was in San Francisco, people were always working on something like, I mean, on a regular basis, I played with one band, two bands, two different bands with completely different approaches once a week for multiple years. Both of those bands would maybe perform in public once a year. Whereas my experience living in New York, it was like, if you didn't have a gig or a tour or a recording session attached to your rehearsals, it was hard to get people to come out to your rehearsals. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>It's like in New York, it's like everybody was looking for a name bigger than theirs. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> that was gonna attach them to a tour or a recording session, where in, in San Francisco, it was more just this community of artists working on something, and the public side of it was something that happened or didn't happen. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I wonder what it is about San Francisco that, that does that because really, you know, I got to know a lot of people that in the late nineties and early two thousands were doing interesting things in sort of the glitch electronic world. And it's a very similar story, which is that everybody was constantly cooking up something all the time, but it didn't, it wasn't aspirational. Nobody was trying to get latch onto the next big gig. Instead, they all felt like it was almost like they were brewing up a really great batch of something. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I'm not sure if it's gonna actually end up good, but the process of brewing, it feels like something good might come out of it. That seems to be a really, particularly San Francisco kind of a thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>It, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3131.945" data-end_ts="3132.165" title="3131.945" id=c_"3131.945">__it__</span>, you know, I've lived there 1, 2, 3 different times. It's still favorite places on the planet, but it's impossible to live there now. Yeah. It's, I mean, Google and Google has fucked that place sideways. Yeah. It's completely possible. Impossible to live, live there. But in San Francisco, it was more about the process. And in New York it was more about the, the end, you know what I mean? Right. More about result 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>Climbing to the top of the pile of whatever it is. Right. I'm sure we're both gonna get chastised for saying such things about New York. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, my, yeah, I don't know. I, I don't think that they would necessarily disagree because for a lot of New York people, that constant hustling represents a different kind of activity that generates a different kind of creativity. And even if that is sort of like the motivation behind it, the result is still some amazing creativity that comes out of it. So Absolutely. Maybe the motivation isn't completely relevant, it just produces different results. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>Yeah. Yeah. That's well put. Well put. We're still gonna get shit though, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Oh yeah, of course we are. So that's, that's pretty interesting though, and I can only imagine how amazing it was to be cooking this stuff together. So, in the end, you ended up part of this punk band that heads off to New York. How long did that band stay together once you made the, made the Trip? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>We, you know, we started in San Francisco and I mean, you know, talking about, you had mentioned this earlier in the conversation. It, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3248.095" data-end_ts="3248.315" title="3248.095" id=c_"3248.095">__the__</span>, you know, 77, 78, 79 80, right in there. I mean, the first time I heard punk music, I was actually on tour with Tina and we were in Australia, and we, I saw this channel coming out of England, and seeing this stuff that was just like, wow, this stuff is insane. And in San Francisco, you know, there was the Buhe Gardens and you know, the Dead Kennedys came from San Francisco, tuxedo Moon, you had the, had the residents there, the whole Ralph Records thing. And it was so interesting because, you know, while you had the faction of punk that was kind of, dead Kennedy's clash, kind of, you know, stripped down hardcore in your face kind of punk, there was also this kind of art punk where you had, as long as you were wearing black and red and your songs were relatively short, and you had a lot of fucking attitude, whatever it was you were doing, you, you saw bands that, no way, they were a punk band, but they were, they were considered punk. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>You know, it really was this, and it was fascinating. There was Free Jazz, which, you know, that name, there's nothing free About Free Jazz. Free, free, free Jazz has a very set, a very strong set of rules. I wasn't the only musician from that community who was very, very intrigued with the punk movement because there was a real freedom in that movement at that period of time when it, you know, hadn't been completely eaten up by the recording industry and turned into these very specific categories. Punk at that period of time was really open category, and you just saw these amazing ensembles that were quite diverse in what they were doing. But it was all in this, under this kind of overarching umbrella. Punk <span style="color:red" data-ts="3383.625" data-end_ts="3383.845" title="3383.625" id=c_"3383.625">__is__</span> a great period of time Yeah. Both in, in San Francisco and New York. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? Yeah. Well, I just, and it was, it was interesting to me because that was when my ears kind of got turned and, and open to things. And it was like a couple of people simultaneously. So it was some of the New York No wave stuff like teenage Jesus and the Jerks, you know? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and, or the residents coming out of, out the West Coast, but it was also like James Blood Elmer's, like crazy power jazz thing. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> going on. And all, all those things kind of combined to be a powerful and head turning thing. And there was something also about the fact that they could label it as punk, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3430.795" data-end_ts="3431.085" title="3430.795" id=c_"3430.795">__like__</span>, or, you know, or like, weird jazz punk combos or something that allowed the, the media to cover it enough so that me in Nose <span style="color:red" data-ts="3442.275" data-end_ts="3442.565" title="3442.275" id=c_"3442.275">__Pick__</span> Wisconsin could actually hear about it. Which is a big deal too, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3448.185" data-end_ts="3448.405" title="3448.185" id=c_"3448.185">__Is__</span> no, there's no question that that little window of time and, and the fact that this umbrella of style was unbelievably diverse and it was all being covered. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know, I think I, I think the punk, the first punk movement is directly responsible for the noise component that is now so accepted across multiple genres of music. Right. That up until the punk movement was literally considered noise and would never be added to any musical composition. And, and if you look at it, if you trace it back, you look at things in film scoring and, and in contemporary classical music, in pop recordings, the elements of, of the composition that are really fall under the category of noise. I think if you follow it back, that's the end point to, to the, the general audience, is that there's movement of punk. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. These, this combination of stuff really led to some incredible, incredible opportunities and in, and a way for people to sort of like jump genres in, in a useful way, I think a musically very useful way. Right. Yeah. But now that brings me back to the concept of conduction, because one, again, at that timeframe, there were people like <span style="color:red" data-ts="3540.505" data-end_ts="3540.725" title="3540.505" id=c_"3540.505">__Son__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3540.885" data-end_ts="3541.005" title="3540.885" id=c_"3540.885">__Rah__</span>, who although he was, you know, active throughout the fifties and sixties and stuff, he started really getting attention as sort of like a godfather in that world, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>Absolutely. I, I'm, I remember during that period of time, sun <span style="color:red" data-ts="3556.205" data-end_ts="3556.325" title="3556.205" id=c_"3556.205">__Rah__</span> came, came to, San Francisco, and he didn't play at the Keystone Corner, which was the jazz club. Right. He played at the Buhe Gardens, which was the punk club. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Right. Exactly. Well, I, I, I remember the first time it was like, that was a time when like Saturday Night Live would, would, you know, bring up the latest punk band, and then all of a sudden one week there's Sun Rock, there's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>Sun Rock 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, and it was like, oh my God. On national, you know, on broadcast tv. It was unbelievable. Yeah. You know, there was this, there was this openness for new devices and new combinations of sound. And I think this is where you're kind of talking about Butch Morris really kind of took advantage of that to, to bring his conduction thing forward, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>Oh, absolutely. You know, his thing, while it was, it was incubated in kind of the free jazz community, because that was the, the jazz and free jazz community was a community that he was very, a part of as a cornet player. He was a fabulous cornet player. Sure. His work with Conduction was incubated in that community, like Christian Markley on turntables, he's, he's, using electronics. He's using live sampling. He's, he's pulling from all these things. He's doing a very racially diverse ensemble. He's using a very <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_(software)">Jitter</a> diverse ensemble. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and really asking you as a musician to bring your experience of music to this place, to create an ensemble music. And, you know, it's, it's interesting. He got a lot of pushback in the beginning, you know, being, have, having conducted for 19 years now, this is, this is very typical. Okay. If you work with musicians who come from any kind of improvising background, and you start, introducing them to this way of working with music, the first thing that happens is all the musicians are confronted with their own fears and their own preconceptions about what they think their instrument is capable of. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, sometimes the pushback will sound like if you're working with improvising musicians, you'll get pushback. Like, I'm an improviser man, you're, you're telling me what to play <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>And if you work with musicians who come from a classical background, you'll get pushback like this. I'm not an improviser. Can you just tell me what you want me to play? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>And I, I don't even use the word improvisation anymore because it's, it's, it's got so much baggage that has nothing to do with the definition of the word. Right. I, I, I just talk about it in terms, there's two kinds of composition. There's composition that takes place over time, and there's composition that takes place in real time if as soon as you get improvisation out of the discussion. Because that whole discussion about improvisation ends up talking about who's in control. That's what it really ends up talking about. If you just talk about composition in the moment and bringing what used to say that a conduction ensemble is, and the essence of conduction is it's ensemble music made by really strong individual personalities. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>And that's what, that's what you want. And, and then the other thing that you discover in conduction, and this is another thing that brings up conceptions about what their instrument can do. I was, I'll give you an example. I was, I was, asked to do this thing at the University of New Mexico. It, the Composer Symposium, and I did a conduction workshop, and these were all students at the university. And I had, this one kid was playing an ARB 2,600, and then there was all these different instruments, and there was a, a, a string section. And I had the 2,600 player come in, and he was making, you know, some gurgling, you know, synthesizer art, 2,600, you know, wonderful sound. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I pointed to this, this cellist, this young woman, and I said, repeat that. And I, I designated her and pointed to the ARB 2,600, and I said, repeat that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>And her mouth just fell open. And I said, just close your eyes and find the sound. And she made this incredible sound on her jello, and it captured the essence of what the ARB 2,600 was doing. And I, I found out later that she had that moment, had, like, changed her whole direction, and that she had up gone to Cal Arts and, and it, it was like a door opening. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know, and, and you know, when you're taught an instrument, there's a lot of baggage that comes with that, you know, and a lot of dogma of how you're taught. And what I've noticed about, conduction and its effect on the musicians who practice it is any sound can be any sound. You know, the cello can sound like the R 2,600, the flute player can be the drummer. The drummer can be the melodic lead instrument. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>And so it's really a music about possibility and about, taking risk and far beyond what, what you think the capabilities of your instrument art and your, and your own capabilities, but holding true to where you come from, you know? <span style="color:red" data-ts="3960.875" data-end_ts="3961.165" title="3960.875" id=c_"3960.875">__Yeah__</span>. Like in my current ensemble that I started after I moved here, I have a very diverse range of players who come from very different backgrounds. And I bring their notion of music and not overlay it on top of the ensemble, but find a way to make their point of view work within the ensemble. And you get these, I think one of the keys to a good conduction is who you choose. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And it isn't about I need a trumpet player, it's, I need this trumpet player. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, and I was gonna say that it seems like the kind of musicians that are willing to embrace this have to be <span style="color:red" data-ts="4011.285" data-end_ts="4011.505" title="4011.285" id=c_"4011.285">__of__</span>, of a pretty peculiar nature in that they have to be exceptionally strong and confident in their use of the instrument, but also willing to accept a different approach to playing that instrument than they've probably ever managed before. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>Yeah, yeah. No, it's, it's, it's incredibly challenging. I, when I talk about conduction, to me it teaches you, and, and this is from the point of view of a conductor now Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, it, it provides you with lessons in composition. It provides you with lessons in sociology, <laugh>, <laugh>. And it provides you with lessons in Qung, which is basically about, energy and moving energy around. And I find it, when I first started conducting, I've, I've studied qung for a while now, and when I first started conducting, that was my first thought was like, wow, this is like practicing qung, <span style="color:red" data-ts="4073.685" data-end_ts="4073.905" title="4073.685" id=c_"4073.685">__ah__</span>, because it is, it is really about moving energy back and forth. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And it's, it's, it's, I think it, you know, I mean, Butch was a really dear friend of mine, and it was, I think this thing that he created, and I know that when he created it, because we talked about this a lot, he was coming from the point of view of being the composer, but the <span style="color:red" data-ts="4100.785" data-end_ts="4101.005" title="4100.785" id=c_"4100.785">__sit__</span> the system that he created actually doesn't allow that to happen. No one is the composer. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, and it's this larger group dynamic that is actually the composer, the mu the music really reveals itself when I do concerts. It's fascinating because there is a, you know, most things you go to, you know what it's gonna sound like before they even start playing. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>You, you even know what the surprises are gonna be. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>With this stuff since the music, we all discover the music at the same moment. Yes. The audience discovers it at exactly the same moment that the musicians discover it. So there's this kind of sense of wonder in the room, like, how did we just get here? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>And it, it's infectious in a really interesting way. There is, there is a, a vibe in the room when you, when you experience one of these things live, that is, that kind of puts the room in this, in this state of wonder. And you realize that if you just stay out of your head and stay out of the way and let the music come through, you having all your background and expertise and musicality in play, but not that being the focus Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, then this music just emerges and you end up hearing this stuff that is just like, man, if you, if you actually sat down and tried to think this stuff up, it would be like, wow. You know? Right. You wouldn't get there. Right. You wouldn't, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="4210.945" data-end_ts="4211.165" title="4210.945" id=c_"4210.945">__You__</span>, you'd never in, you'd never intellectualize what you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>Get. Yeah. If you like hired some poor intern to transcribe this music, and then you tried to play it off of a page, it, it would be a nightmare. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And yet it happens effortlessly in the moment 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>Now. <span style="color:red" data-ts="4237.195" data-end_ts="4237.485" title="4237.195" id=c_"4237.195">__Sure__</span>. There's a, there's a learning curve. There's a learning curve as you're learning the vocabulary, just like anything, you know, it's like when, when you know your synthesizer so well that you don't even have to look at the filter knob or this knob or that knob, you just know, you just reach it. You can close your eyes and you can dial it in and you don't have to think about it. Okay. That's when you've mastered that instrument. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And it's the same with learning. This is a vocabulary. And as you internalize this vocabulary to where you don't have to think that, okay, that sign means I have to do this, what am I going to do? When you get past that initial learning curve and you just respond and stay out of your head and stop trying to, you know, be clever or figure out what everybody else is doing, but just respond in the moment, then you get to that, you get to this place where it's just magic. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Now, one of the things I'm curious about, because I, I went <span style="color:red" data-ts="4307.885" data-end_ts="4308.005" title="4307.885" id=c_"4307.885">__and__</span> I took a peek at, at the kind of lineup of players that you have in your current group, which is called the Fluxx Crew, right? Yeah. That's what you're calling it. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. I noticed it's, it's kind of a peculiar mix of instrumentation. So first of all, you have a lot of bass register instruments. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And, but you also have a, what looks like a Chinese instrument? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>Chang <span style="color:red" data-ts="4334.405" data-end_ts="4334.565" title="4334.405" id=c_"4334.405">__who__</span>? The Chung who, alright. The Chang <span style="color:red" data-ts="4335.965" data-end_ts="4336.085" title="4335.965" id=c_"4335.965">__who__</span> is basically the, if the he who is the violin uhhuh of the Chinese orchestra, the Chang, <span style="color:red" data-ts="4342.645" data-end_ts="4342.765" title="4342.645" id=c_"4342.645">__who__</span> is the veal. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Got it. Okay. And you have Victoria playing the Thein and a couple of electric guitar players. Yeah. To what extent do you, do you feel the responsibility to manage the instrument instrumentation of the band? Or do you find that that's just a <span style="color:red" data-ts="4362.005" data-end_ts="4362.405" title="4362.005" id=c_"4362.005">__palette__</span> that you work with in real time then and it doesn't matter what the instrumentation is? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>That's a really great question. It really depends on the project. If I'm doing something specific, like I had a electric guitar choir for a year. It was six electric guitars and two electric percussionists. And I didn't want anything to, to be acoustic. I wanted everything coming outta speakers. I wanted to really explore the sonic possibilities of the electric guitar, which are so huge. I mean, they're just so mammoth. That's one thing, you know, or I've done things with poets. So if you, if if you're putting a, a group together for a specific purpose, I still maintain that. I, I wouldn't say I want to have a cello player. I would say I want to have this cello player. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Got it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>In the situation here, I had an ensemble in New Mexico that <span style="color:red" data-ts="4433.355" data-end_ts="4433.575" title="4433.355" id=c_"4433.355">__was__</span> lasted for 15 years doing conduction. And when I moved here to <affirmative>, Colorado, I wanted to put together an ensemble and the basis of both of these ensembles, the one in New Mexico. And, and the one here was, is that there's no goal that it's just about exploring this way of creating music. Got it. We're not gonna make t-shirts, we're not gonna make CDs, we're not gonna go on tour. We're just gonna do this. And it, and it only happens once a month's. <span style="color:red" data-ts="4467.045" data-end_ts="4467.365" title="4467.045" id=c_"4467.045">__Nothing__</span>. There's nothing to practice for. There's nothing to study for. It's just, it's like I tell, I tell 'em, this has to be as important as your bowling team. Okay. This is the thing that you do on the third Sunday of the month, <laugh>, you say no to everything else unless you're <span style="color:red" data-ts="4488.045" data-end_ts="4488.205" title="4488.045" id=c_"4488.045">__outta__</span> town. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>Right Now, I didn't really know a lot of musicians here. I knew two people. I knew <span style="color:red" data-ts="4495.125" data-end_ts="4495.245" title="4495.125" id=c_"4495.125">__a__</span>, a dj, DJ ultraviolet who <span style="color:red" data-ts="4498.865" data-end_ts="4499.085" title="4498.865" id=c_"4498.865">__ca__</span> who I knew from New Mexico, and I knew Janet Federer. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> a wonderful guitarist. Right. And then I met Mark Moser, by, I figured one way I could try to plug into the community was, you know, go to the, Boulder <span style="color:red" data-ts="4515.215" data-end_ts="4515.565" title="4515.215" id=c_"4515.215">__synth__</span> meetup. Right. Thing I saw that I, I found that link to them. And that's how I met Mark. But it was Janet really, who I said, Janet, I wanna put a conduction ensemble together. I don't know anybody, you know, can you hook me up with a few people? She said, write something up and send it to me. And kind of as an open call. Right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I'll send it, I'll circulate it. Okay. And so she wrote this, you know, wonderful, email letter kind of introducing me to the community. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>And I ba basically did a, you know, an open session and on her queue that she sent it out to these people, this collection of people she knew who <span style="color:red" data-ts="4562.105" data-end_ts="4562.325" title="4562.105" id=c_"4562.105">__thi__</span> who she thought would respond well to this. And a number of people showed up. And then I met a few more people. This kind of is, they arrived, you know, so I had no, it wasn't like predetermined. This was kind of the instrumentation that showed up. Hmm. And, and I was like, oh, this is, you know, this is interesting. It's like we've got this kind of electronic component and this kind of classical component, and the musicians are coming from very, very diverse backgrounds. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And so we did it once and I said, you know, so here's the deal. You know, if you want to do this, it's once a month. If you're in town, this is what you do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>If you're not in town, great. Or if you're sick, whatever. But other than that, this is what we, you do we'll maybe play once a year. I record everything, but whether something or gets published, who knows the experience of doing it is so rich that it's, it's kinda like it's, this is your creative time to explore music in a way that you're not gonna get to explore it in any other situation. You do. And that's the takeaway from it is the, the pure joy of doing this. And then the instrumentation, it's, you know, it's funny. It's like, we've got, you know, two acoustic basses, a cello, a Chong <span style="color:red" data-ts="4643.485" data-end_ts="4643.685" title="4643.485" id=c_"4643.485">__who__</span> and a thein. And that's my in quintet, you know? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Like, I think the work that Victoria is doing, I think of, of any instrument that is certainly going to be challenged by how one creates music in a conduction situation, it's gonna be a theorem. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>Right. And I think she's, I think she's doing an amazing job. Yeah. And she's so incredibly musical. Yeah. And you know, it was, it was, it was fascinating. One of the first things that happened as she started getting more comfortable, I said, you know, I was listening to it and the thein has been used in such a specific way for so long that we have this kind of picture that comes into our heads when we hear a thermin. And I, and I asked her, I said, you know, can you vary the octave that you're in? You know? 'cause you usually hear the thermin in this really kind of soprano range. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And she dropped the overall tuning down in octave, and it, now it's like this, this glue that just could move in and out of the ensemble in this amazing way. Victoria's so great. I mean, she just said, sure, I can do that. You know, and, it's like you find these things where you're used to hearing instruments do a certain thing <span style="color:red" data-ts="4734.745" data-end_ts="4734.965" title="4734.745" id=c_"4734.745">__and__</span> certain styles of music and all that is kind of thrown out the window in a conduction situation Right. Where any instrument can take any role. Sure. And what I like about lower pitched instruments is lower pitched instruments can sound really good up high Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, but higher pitched instruments can never go low. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, and there's some kind of organic quality to <span style="color:red" data-ts="4764.945" data-end_ts="4765.165" title="4764.945" id=c_"4764.945">__the__</span>, some of the lower instruments. <span style="color:red" data-ts="4766.365" data-end_ts="4766.525" title="4766.365" id=c_"4766.365">__You__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="4766.525" data-end_ts="4766.685" title="4766.525" id=c_"4766.525">__know__</span>, you have like a bass clarinet and, and you know, the double bass and those things have such <span style="color:red" data-ts="4771.595" data-end_ts="4771.885" title="4771.595" id=c_"4771.595">__oral__</span>, organic sound that it's, it's a wonderful, again, a wonderful palette to work with, I assume. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>Yeah. Oh, it is. It's amazing. And you get these when Brian Mullens, who plays The Chang, <span style="color:red" data-ts="4784.605" data-end_ts="4784.765" title="4784.605" id=c_"4784.605">__who__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="4784.825" data-end_ts="4785.045" title="4784.825" id=c_"4784.825">__is__</span>, who's just a, such a fabulous musician and he's mostly known for his work in Irish bands, you know? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And so, so here he is playing this instrument. He plays a number of instruments and he's, he's such a free spirit in his musical. I mean, his playing is just amazing, but it's like all one, one of the guitarists is Ferreal Lowe, who is a fabulous guitar player and really adept at the textural aspects of electric guitar. And it's, it's great to hear some wacky thing come out of Ferrell and then point to Brian and say, repeat that, you know? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, and, and see him find a way to make that sound on an instrument that you would never think that sound could come from. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So one of the things that I get from this, too, is that there actually is a kind of an incredible responsibility on the players. I mean, more so than even a typical improv situation. The responsibility on the players to constantly be listening to everybody else in the ensemble 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>Oh yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Is, that has to be something that takes practice just to get people to be comfortable and to have, you know, again, rather than saying, okay, I have to listen, I have to listen, instead of like, thinking about listening, they have to just listen. Yeah. So I'm curious then, what does a rehearsal look like? Is a rehearsal just playing, but helping people remain open to those kind of behaviors? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>Yeah, it's, well, basically the, the first thing is, is you can't call it a rehearsal because we're not rehearsing for anything. Right? So it's a session. It's, it's a session because it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="4896.285" data-end_ts="4896.325" title="4896.285" id=c_"4896.285">__a__</span> performance. Right? It is a performance. There's just nobody else in the room, <laugh>. It is, you're basically in the, in the early sessions, you're going through the signs and you're showing them possibilities basically. And you're reinforcing that thing about staying out of your head. Don't think, don't analyze, just respond and always be listening to everything, you know? 'cause if I lock something in, <span style="color:red" data-ts="4928.125" data-end_ts="4928.285" title="4928.125" id=c_"4928.125">__as__</span> in as a memory, it's like, okay, here, I'll give you an example. There's one sign called panning. Okay. So if I take the baton and I hold it in front of the violin player, as long as the baton is in front of the violin player, the violin player plays Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, when the baton is not in front of the violin player, they stop playing. Okay. So when it moves in front of another musician and they play, okay, so I can make a sweeping arc that goes between four players say, and I can repeat that arc <span style="color:red" data-ts="4966.785" data-end_ts="4967.005" title="4966.785" id=c_"4966.785">__as__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="4967.285" data-end_ts="4967.525" title="4967.285" id=c_"4967.285">__<inaudible>__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>Okay. I can lock that into a repeat and then that they have to remember what they're playing, but they have to leave space for when the other people play. So it's like creating a little sequence. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> <affirmative>. Each step of that sequence is a different set of notes for a specific duration of time. And then that person has to be silent when the next step of the sequence is playing. Okay. I could get like three of those going with different subgroups of the ensemble. And they're in different time, you know, they're different arcs. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> like multiple sequences that are not clocked together. Right. I <span style="color:red" data-ts="5016.925" data-end_ts="5017.045" title="5016.925" id=c_"5016.925">__can__</span> make that entire thing memory one. I see. Yeah. And then when we, 10 minutes later, I can go memory one boom. And those three sequences have to be right where they were. And not only the, the notes, but the intensity of the notes, the, the actual sound you are creating. So yeah, there's a huge responsibility. And the responsibility is to the ensemble, it's to, it's to composing in the moment. And so it's incredibly, the response you get mostly is that it demands an unbelievable level of focus, but there's an incredible feeling of liberation and that those two feelings coexisting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. So Dino, we have blown through our time and then some, I really wanted to get into a little bit more about your playing and where you're at with instruments. I wanted to get into your work as a sound designer. We haven't got a chance to touch base on any of that stuff because we were exploring better stuff or different stuff or good stuff. And so we're gonna have you back on the podcast again in a little bit to kind of follow up on some of this other stuff. But before you go, I am hoping, I am trusting that our discussions about the conduction, system and concept have opened people's minds to want to explore further. Where are the best places for people to go to find out more or maybe to experience groups that are doing conduction work or maybe workshops where conduction is being experimented with. Where do people go? Where can people go to learn more and to experience some of this stuff themselves? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>Well, you could go, you can definitely go to my site j dean.com and I do a monthly blog on the site called Traveling with Electronics. And I do a lot about conduction, and there's a lot in the past blogs about conduction there. You can go to Conduction Us, which is Butch's site, and you can see the whole history of conduction. There is actually, when Butch passed, he had not finished his workbook on conduction. And for the past two and a half years, I have been working with a small group of people to finish that book. And, my part of it was actually working to articulate the lexicon, the signs. You have something that's basically taught to you orally. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And when you <laugh> have to write that down, man, you learn a lot about what words really mean <laugh>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="5198.965" data-end_ts="5199.045" title="5198.965" id=c_"5198.965">__and__</span> you have to do that. So that book is now done, and my understanding is the book is going to be released within the next few months. There will definitely be a post about that on Conduction Us, and there'll definitely be a post about that on my site. So, and you, if you go on YouTube and, and just put in Butch Morris conduction, you'll, you'll see a number of videos of, conductions He's done. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, thank you so much for your time. It is, this was incredibly enlightening and fun to talk about and fun to kind of talk about both the history and kind of really the future too, of these thing, these things. And, and also really exciting to hear about a whole new way to experience or produce music. I really appreciate you taking the time to do this. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dino: </b>Well, it's a pleasure chatting with you. I mean, it's, you know, you do these interviews and it all comes down to the, the person on the other end. And you're a, you're a joy to talk with. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, thank you so much. I appreciate it. And with that, I'll say, I'll say goodbye. Have a great day. Many thanks to Dino for the chat. It was really interesting getting some info on conduction, a little bit on his background and just some ideas about how he thinks about music. It's the kind of thing we can all use a little bit more of in our life. Thank you all for listening and I look forward to next week's, chat. See you then. Bye.
