<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. This week I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to somebody that I've kind of known on and off for a while. I run into him every time I'm in New York, it seems, because he's always working and he's always working, in the neck of the woods that I like to visit, which is the Columbia Music Electronic Music Studios. This person's name is Douglas Roberto, and he is, leading the MFA Charge in Sound Arts. Is that correct? Yep, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Douglas Repetto: </b>That's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Yeah. Okay. Additionally, he has, started a lot of different collaborative projects. He's done an amazing amount of work. And so with that short introduction, I'm gonna say hi to Douglas Repeal. Hi, Doug. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Douglas: </b>Hi, Darwin I'm great. How are you? Happy New Year. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, happy New Year to you too. The listeners probably need to know that. In fact, this is the second time that we're doing this interview. The first time was what led me to, do a Kickstarter campaign for Digital Recorder. So now I actually have a, a little Zoom digital recorder that the listeners bought me, running at the same time as, the Audio Hijack Pro, so that hopefully I don't have a failure like that again. So there you go. All 
</p>

<p>
<b>Douglas: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Safety. Yeah. A safety a safety net. Ryan <laugh>. So, why don't we start off by having you explain what you do. You do so many things. You have so many irons in the fire. I'd kinda like to hear you talk about things that you consider worthy of speaking about. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Douglas: </b>Yeah, I do a lot of different things. I'm an artist, I guess that's probably the, the first way I think of myself. I'm also a teacher and I've been teaching for, for quite a long time. I collaborate with lots of different people, and I like to take on all different roles when I'm collaborating. So it, it really changes. I guess one of the main things is that I, I like exercising different parts of my brain, and I like exploring different ways of being creative. So it's, it's, I rarely do any one, thing continuously. It's almost always sort of, working on multiple projects at once and lots of different threads, both conceptually, but also just, you know, the, the actual kind of work, whether it's soldering and then programming and then writing and then, troubleshooting someone else's piece or, or whatever. It's always a big mix. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, that's, it's actually interesting that you say that because, it seems like every time I kind of blow through Columbia, what I end up seeing you do is something I've never seen you do before. <laugh> <laugh>. Right. So, sometimes, I see you with a nut driver in your hand going at a, you know, a a little device. Sometimes the solder smoke is floating up, and sometimes you are, sometimes you're coding at a computer. I mean, it's, I just, I just see you working in all these environments and you seem to flow very easily from one to the other. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Douglas: </b>Yeah. I, I really like moving around physically. <laugh> I really like, and conceptually as well, and I like working with different kinds of people with, with different interests. And, you know, I, I think one of the, one of the things that I learned from people I considered to be my mentors is that I, I've always been attracted to people who have very broad interests and who can sort of surprise you with your, you're in a car or something, and all of a sudden you're talking about something that you never would've imagined they have years of experience with. And I find that really a, a neat way to think about living your life. That you don't have to just do one or two things. You can actually do lots and lots of things. And that the, the world is so broad that, there's, there's just endless, intrigue out there to be found. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now that brings me to one of the first things I actually wanted to talk to you about, because it's something I'm always curious about, and speaking to you is gonna give me hopefully some insight on the, the thing that I sometimes struggle with, which is breadth versus depth. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, right. So you seem to be advocating the idea of having a broad, having breadth, having a broad range of interests that you can use. You can use one to inform the other, but I sometimes find that when I do that, I start craving depth, craving depth in one area or another. And I'm curious to know, how do you deal with what seems to me like a dichotomy either, you know, you can have either breath or depth, but there's hard, there isn't really enough time for both. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Douglas: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah. I don't, I don't think it's a dichotomy, really. And I think part of the question for me is, you know, is what I'm doing challenging and do I find like I'm, I'm learning something and do I feel like I'm, I'm going somewhere interesting with it. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="318.105" data-end_ts="318.325" title="318.105" id=c_"318.105">__so__</span>, so rather than getting too hung up on, you know, how somebody else might see what I'm doing or how I might be judged for whether I'm a Dante or not, et cetera, <laugh>, it's, it's more that I know in my own mind all the different threads that are happening. And something might look shallow in one aspect, but it's actually connected to some other really long, complex project I'm working on and some train of thought that I've been having for five years. And so, you can't, these things aren't happening in isolation. So if, if it, if it were that simple that it's just like you, you pick a thing and you only learn a tiny bit of it and move on, maybe it'd be a problem. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Douglas: </b>But that's, that's not what you're doing. You're not, it's not like you're just doing that one thing for itself. At least I'm not, <span style="color:red" data-ts="363.805" data-end_ts="364.085" title="363.805" id=c_"363.805">__when__</span> whatever I do, it's all connected to these larger threads and larger ideas. And, so I, I just, I don't worry about that. I think of it as in my teaching as well. I describe it as a kind of rabbit hole teaching. Like, I think it's great to go down as far as you want and as far as you can into rabbit holes that have no apparent purpose, and you can't really justify in any clear way. Because my experience has been that those are the, that that's the way you, you do end up finding really amazing things and, and you end up having ideas that are really fruitful and, and having thoughts that you otherwise would've had trouble getting to. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Douglas: </b>You know, it's just not a, a linear rational process. So in my classes, for instance, we, I usually have a disclaimer which kind of says, I'm not gonna try to teach you anything obviously useful. Instead, we're gonna follow threads and we're gonna, things are gonna come up that are gonna distract us. And the syllabus is not gonna be, I don't even really bother with an extensive syllabus because, you know, you don't know what's gonna come along. And it's really worth, if you want dive in deep on some weird little detail that can be fantastic. But it would be silly to, to try to say ahead of time that getting super detailed knowledge about something is good. Whereas getting surface knowledge about something is bad. It's just, it's completely dependent on context. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, and I also think too, that sometimes, and, and I certainly, I, I can recognize it more often in my students than I could ever recognize in myself or my own work. But I do recognize in my students that sometimes, because they may not have gone into a certain area of, of study in great depth, one of the things you end up finding is that they take really unique and idiosyncratic swipes at things that nobody who had studied the area would have ever <span style="color:red" data-ts="478.915" data-end_ts="479.205" title="478.915" id=c_"478.915">__take__</span> taken. Right? Sure. But because, but because they were sort of innocent about what you can't do, it really gave them the opportunity to take <span style="color:red" data-ts="487.605" data-end_ts="488.165" title="487.605" id=c_"487.605">__UAU__</span> unique angle on, on the area. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Douglas: </b>Sure. And that's, you know, that's almost a cliche with, with kids. I have a, right now, a 6-year-old and <laugh>, he says all kinds of wacky shit <laugh> because he doesn't know how he's supposed to think about things, and he doesn't know what he's supposed to say. And, you know, people without kids, I guess, get tired of us telling them how, how cute and interesting our children are. But it's great 'cause you're just, you're seeing this mind putting the world together in, in ways that it hasn't been put together before. And I, I, I actually really dislike the, the idea that like, well, we have to be more like children. 'cause children are also pretty stupid <laugh>. But you know, there, there's some aspects of the way children are able to use their, their make connections more freely. That I, I agree with you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Douglas: </b>Really neat things can come out of that. But it, <span style="color:red" data-ts="541.005" data-end_ts="541.125" title="541.005" id=c_"541.005">__I__</span> I think it's also worth saying that, you know, I, I'm talking specifically about certain kinds of creative activities and teaching classes in certain ways makes a lot of sense for creative activities where there's, there really is no particular target. There's no goal, there's no good way to evaluate whether you did a good job or not. The payoff may be way down the line, and you may never even know what the payoff was. There's lots of other domains where that would be a, a terrible way, right. To teach. And, you know, we want, we know how to make bridges that stay up <laugh>. We know how to make airplanes that are gonna fly. And not that you can't be creative and innovate and have new ideas, but you know, the, the, the basic physics are the same for everybody. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Douglas: </b>So there are bodies of knowledge that sometimes people take a class, and the goal of the class is to give them that body of knowledge. I'm not against that at all. I want certain people that I rely on in my life to be really good at those things. At the same time, the kind of classes we would generally be involved in aren't about that. They're, I don't, and, but sometimes there's this kind of push for professionalization. It makes, it wants to pretend that there is, that there's like, well, these are the skills. Every young musician or every young artist must know how to do <span style="color:red" data-ts="615.685" data-end_ts="615.805" title="615.685" id=c_"615.685">__B__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="615.805" data-end_ts="616.005" title="615.805" id=c_"615.805">__blah__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="616.405" data-end_ts="616.525" title="616.405" id=c_"616.405">__B__</span>. And I think that's really delusional and silly. You know, there's, there's, it's very difficult to imagine a situation and where, because an artist didn't know some particular technical thing, a bridge fell down and people got hurt <laugh>, you know, it's like, right. That's not what we're dealing with, right? So why not? Because we're in that situation where you have this kind of freedom. Why not really exploit it? Why not really go for it and get over some of these kind of moral framings of things that I think come from situations where there is a moral aspect to it. You know, if you're gonna build an airplane, you really should understand what makes airplanes fly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. I, I wanna, I wanna really burn, burn down this highway. But before we do, I think you've already sort of like laid down some of the groundwork necessary for anyone who's listening who doesn't know you <laugh> to already be able to say, wow, where's this guy from <laugh>? Right. <laugh>. Because you're, you take a very different approach at a lot of things, and you're really open, but also really mindful about the things that you feel passionate towards. What I'm curious about is what is your background? What is, what is it that allowed you to sort of have this free and open thinking, way about you that is quite frankly, not typical? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Douglas: </b>I, I don't know that a lot of people who know me well would agree that I have a free and open way <laugh>. They might say I'm a, I'm a blowhard. But I, i, I don't mind thinking of myself that way. My background as far as art and music is, I had no background really. I never took music lessons. I didn't come from musical family. I didn't do any of that stuff really until later in high school when I had to kind of, my parents demanded that I take a sport, they wanted me to run track or something, and Right. I finally put my foot down and said, I'm just, I'm not doing this. I'm not interested in this. So they relented and let me, you know, do the high school play instead. But it was kind of, it didn't seem to really count. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Douglas: </b>Like it wasn't really a legitimate activity. Right, right. So I, you know, I was pretty much self-taught in, in everything I do. Didn't take <span style="color:red" data-ts="755.925" data-end_ts="756.165" title="755.925" id=c_"755.925">__music__</span> lessons, didn't take programming or anything like that. I just, you know, just, I, I'm, I'm pretty good at teaching myself things and doing research and learning from books and stuff like that. And then I've happened to just run into a few people who were really inspiring to me and really, you know, sort of became mentors. And they tended to people be people who kind of had a similar outlook, which was, you know, you, you, if you're an artist, you, you don't really matter that much. Nobody particularly cares what you're doing. You can admit that and then use that as a kind of freedom to not be too hung up about how you're gonna be judged or, or, you know, feeling like you have to make grand claims about what you're doing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Douglas: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="803.465" data-end_ts="803.685" title="803.465" id=c_"803.465">__And__</span> you can still be very passionate <span style="color:red" data-ts="805.045" data-end_ts="805.245" title="805.045" id=c_"805.045">__and__</span> really believe in what you're doing. But you can also, you have a kind of freedom. You're, you're not under moral obligation to do things in a particular way. Right. Or to satisfy someone else. <span style="color:red" data-ts="818.515" data-end_ts="818.805" title="818.515" id=c_"818.515">__That__</span>, that also means you shouldn't then feel like you deserve people to la you for what you've done <laugh>. Especially since you're admitting in the first place that you're, you're not doing things that try to, you know, make them happy. But, so it kind of cuts both ways. But I've just had some really good examples of people in my life who live life as an as, as very open inquisitive artists who are very broad-minded and accept, you know, I would say to me, it's, I was talking to someone the other day and they were asking me kind of what style I like or, or something like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Douglas: </b>And, and I've realized that it's, it's really more that I, I don't really, I don't care that much about the particulars of what someone makes. I'm much more interested in the fact that they're living a creative life and they're making interesting decisions. And, you know, the rest of it comes down to taste. And I might share taste with them. I might not, but like, who caress about that? To me, it's, it's, it's irrelevant. It's more are they making use of whatever opportunities they have? Are they making creative decisions? Are they trying to be a, a, a, a good force in the world? That seems to me to be much more interesting than do they share my position on some aesthetic question or, or technical, do they use the same software I do? <span style="color:red" data-ts="895.805" data-end_ts="896.005" title="895.805" id=c_"895.805">__Right__</span>. And then they hate the right company or 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Whatever. <laugh> of the many things that you, that you do, you're, you have your hand, well into electronics, you do some programming when it's necessary. You do, artistic endeavors and musical endeavors. What came first? What, what was the starting point? What was the ball that got things rolling for you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Douglas: </b>Geez, I don't know. I guess, I guess in some sense, music, although, as I said, because I never had lessons or anything like that, I never really quite, I didn't know that contemporary music existed. And, so I, so I didn't, it, it wasn't really until late high school or college that I ever really encountered, people thinking about music in, in, you know, new kind of contemporary ways. I was always interested in, in cycles and systems and relationships, even as a little kid before I would be able to explain it that way. I, you know, a little bit obsessive and I would, you know, have things repeating in my head, and I would be, as a kid, little kid thinking about the relationships between words and puns and sounds and rhymes and stuff like that. Right. So that's always been a part of the way my brain works, is just connecting disparate elements and finding ways that they're similar or finding ways they make the same patterns or whatever. And, you know, that probably kind of naturally most naturally led to music, I guess, early on. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see. And then, what did the electronics come from a desire to make your own unique instruments or as a way to cheaply build something, you know, build a kit or something? How did, how did you get into that? And I, I'm especially interested because for me, getting into music and contemporary music was, was relatively easy because my head seemed to work right for it. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1025.465" data-end_ts="1025.815" title="1025.465" id=c_"1025.465">__Right__</span>. I had a real struggle learning electronics and, in a way that I didn't when I was learning programming. Right, right. And so I'm always curious when there's somebody who kind of is able to juggle both kinds of disciplines. I'm always curious about what is it about electronics that got 'em into it and what hooked <span style="color:red" data-ts="1046.455" data-end_ts="1046.695" title="1046.455" id=c_"1046.455">__them__</span> on it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Douglas: </b>Right. Well, yeah, definitely some things, you know, are, are much flow, much better for some people than others. I, I did not start with computers or electronics thinking about music. I started it much more abstractly in a way. My, my dad was a high school teacher, and one summer he brought home, you know, the computer lab wasn't being used over the summer, so I guess they let the teachers bring home a, a computer. I think it was a TRS 80. Okay. And, he brought it home and just, it sat in the living room, and I just, you know, had a summer kind of alone. And I just taught myself how to program the computer. And, you know, there was a manual would come with computers at that time. You know, it would tell you what, what the basic is. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Douglas: </b>And, I, I, there was some magazine called Compute, I think, which I probably started getting later, but you could, it would, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1110.245" data-end_ts="1110.445" title="1110.245" id=c_"1110.245">__had__</span> had machine code that you could type in. And so I just, you know, it, it was just this interesting object sitting in the living room, and nobody else was doing anything with it. So I just learned how to use it. And I would make little games and little graphics things, and I was really intrigued by all the symbol, the keys, each key, you know, in addition to the letters, it had a bunch of little graphics, primitives associated with each key. And by, you know, it's kinda like holding down control and getting a 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right odd character. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Douglas: </b>Right. Yeah. An odd character. It was like that, but it was little graphics thing. So, you know, I just explored the hell out of that computer for, a summer, and then we got a commodore or something. And, it didn't really have any point. And I remember that that kind of frustrated my parents because they didn't understand, as, you know, it's e once you get absorbed, you can just go in deep. Right. And from the outside, there's absolutely no apparent use for this <laugh>. And, and at the time, it still, you know, it was early enough that it wasn't clear why a kid teaching themselves computer programming was gonna be useful in some way. And I remember, I, it's, it's ironic now that I, I spent a long time working at the computer music center at Columbia. And that I, at one point when I was getting the music, I wanted to buy a, a keyboard. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Douglas: </b>And I remember my dad was, was Scornful and said something like, well, oh yeah, he's gonna buy a com, he's gonna buy a music keyboard that's just gonna go the way of the computer. You know, like, I'm just gonna waste some time on that and then move on to the next thing. Right. And yet I ended up working at the computer music, center. So it took a long time for it to become apparent why these things were, you know, useful. But, but they did. So for the, the music side, I mean, I got <span style="color:red" data-ts="1229.765" data-end_ts="1229.965" title="1229.765" id=c_"1229.765">__into__</span> sort of writing music and acoustic music before I was interested in using computers or electronics for music. As a kid, I would take, you know, when I was a tinkerer, who would take apart a clock radio or something like that and, and then, you know, not be able to put it back together. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Douglas: </b>But I wasn't really thinking about that in terms of making music. It was more, when I was in college and I went to the University of Miami, which was fantastic because it was not a, a particularly challenging college, let's say. So I, you know, I could just kind of do whatever I wanted to do. They were very supportive of me in the music department, but it wasn't a place that was full of like, hot <span style="color:red" data-ts="1268.965" data-end_ts="1269.245" title="1268.965" id=c_"1268.965">__shot__</span> musicians or experimental musicians. And so I started wanting to do experiments of various sorts, but there weren't really players who were gonna go along with me, you know, if I wanted to say like, you know, what does it sound like if you play one note on a cello for three hours or something? Right. There was no one, they, they weren't up for that. But after a while I realized, oh, you can get computers to do that for you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Douglas: </b>And so I could, write a little c sound program or something, you know, to make a OneNote play for three hours if I wanted to. And that kind of led me into applying computer programming to making sound. But pretty quickly, once I started doing that, I realized that it, it really wasn't as interesting as I thought it was gonna be <laugh>, and that the thing I was compelled by was not actually the sound of one note for three hours. It was the notion of a person trying to do something ridiculous. Right. And that's kind of one of the things I think you can lose with computers is that it's true. You can get them to do whatever you want, but is getting something to do whatever you want. Actually an interesting goal, you know, and sometimes it is, but for the kind of goals I had, it turned out it's generally not. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Douglas: </b>So I almost never use computers to, I almost never say I want such and such, and then I figure out how to get a computer to do it. I, I just, that's not, I don't have the kind of ideas where that's interesting. Particularly because as you know, you, you have to kind of know what you're doing in the first place. And, I don't, I don't really like to know what I'm doing in that sense. I like to kind of make situations where I'm not quite sure what I'm doing or I'm not quite sure what's gonna happen. And the physical world is great for that. Right. You know, it's hopeless controlling for the war <laugh>, it never works. And electronics are kind of hopeless and full of noise and full of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1384.945" data-end_ts="1385.165" title="1384.945" id=c_"1384.945">__all__</span> sorts of strange behaviors. And you're constantly tracking things down. And as the environment change changes, you're, you know, instruments change. And, to me that's very exciting. You know, so that kinda led me into learning electronics and things like that was, was a dissatisfaction with, I realized <span style="color:red" data-ts="1405.405" data-end_ts="1405.525" title="1405.405" id=c_"1405.405">__I__</span> could use computers to make sounds, but that I, I just didn't find that very interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I think that that's actually, though, a really interesting approach. But before we get there, I have to ask, so you went to school at, at Miami. What instrument did you play? It sounds like you didn't really have an instrument per se. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Douglas: </b>I did not. I, I was nominally a voice major. Okay. Which is a, you know, a cute way of getting away away with not having to actually know how to play an instrument. <laugh>. Okay. I mean, I can play lots of, I can make lots of instruments emit sound, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Make <span style="color:red" data-ts="1448.165" data-end_ts="1448.285" title="1448.165" id=c_"1448.165">__it__</span> sound right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Douglas: </b>That's no problem. And, and to, you know, for a long time, I, I did, you know, play saxophone and clarinet and things like that, and I could read music and, you know, I had to take music classes. I've just never been, I've never been a practicer, so I'm not gonna do my scales, you know. Sure, sure. And I played in lots of noise groups and things like that. Got it. But yeah, I went to University of Miami. I was a double major. They had this thing where if you were gonna have a, a useless major like music, you were supposed to also have a, a serious major to go along with it. But somehow I conned them into letting me have my two majors be music and script writing, <laugh>, both, both of which were equally, useless. So I was pretty proud of, really doing nothing in college. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I, I was, I was just gonna suggest that you must have been an enigma to the typical academic. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Douglas: </b>Yeah. Well, university of Miami is not a particularly academic place. It's, it's much different now, I think. Yeah. But it was great. It was kind of inspiring when I look back on it. 'cause I realized people really, some people just weren't paying attention, like the administration, it, it just didn't matter. You could just kind of snow them. But particularly the music professors, I was not doing what they were interested in, and yet they were so supportive and they really just, I think, recognized that I was working really hard. I was learning all this stuff. And so they kind of just were saying, Hey, this is great. Keep doing what you're doing. Like we're just gonna, we're not gonna bother you too much. And I kind of try to make that my teaching philosophy now, too. It's like, if someone's working really hard, I, I don't care about requirements and this and that. It's like, just yeah. Work really hard. That's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Do the thing. Right. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Douglas: </b>That's it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So how, how did you get from a music slash script writing career plot at Miami to New York City and Columbia? How did that transition occur? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Douglas: </b>There were lots of parts to it. At Miami, I, I, you know, started to get into, you know, learned a lot more about experimental music and, and started to, to see things and, and meet people and stuff like that. And kind of knew that I, I wasn't interested in being a composer really. And also that I wasn't interested in writing scripts, but I wasn't quite sure what I wanted to do. So I, when I graduated, I decided to try to be useful. And I did a volunteer thing for a year. So I went off to be a volunteer teacher. Okay. And that was really difficult and interesting. And at the end of it, I realized, okay, I actually wanna be an artist. <laugh> and I, taken with me. I was in a very remote, very remote place in, in, Costa Rica. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Douglas: </b>And, but I had taken the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1626.145" data-end_ts="1626.365" title="1626.145" id=c_"1626.145">__Cal__</span> Arts course catalog with me, or their, the application catalog or something. I don't know what, but I would get it out once in a while and kind of stare longingly at it. And on the back page was an interview with a guy who was making paintings by injecting paint up his ass, and then sort of squirting it out on the canvases. And I remember <laugh> really being inspired by that. Not, not that I wanted to do that, but just that, oh, there's a place where they would actually put that in the course catalog. Right, right. That this would be, Hey, yeah, why not admit that this is something people do here. So that kind of helped me decide I really wanted to go to Cal Arts and, you know, just figure out what was next. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Douglas: </b>And so then I went there and that's where I met more really fantastic people who had that, that same attitude of just, there kind of were requirements, but you, you, you know, if you were working really hard and people recognized that, then they would just kinda let you do what you needed to do. Sure. And it was fantastic. So I met Tom Orb, for instance. Oh, sure. Right. Turn into a long <span style="color:red" data-ts="1694.245" data-end_ts="1694.405" title="1694.245" id=c_"1694.245">__term__</span> friend and mentor. And Larry Polanski, who really, you know, has, has been pretty much the primary, motivator in my life, I think. And he, he came to visit Cal Arts at one point as just a visiting artist. And we just sat down and started talking. And I had known some of his music and really liked it. And it was very different from what I was doing. But we talked and got along really well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Douglas: </b>And then towards the end of my second year when I was gonna graduate, he got a grant from the NSF to do something called Math across the curriculum. And he was gonna, his part of it was gonna be to write a book about music and computers. And, he invited me to come out to Dartmouth and write that book with him. Okay. So that was fantastic. Right outta grad school. I just, you know, graduated. And then that summer drove across the country and my pickup truck and went to live, in rural Vermont. And spent a year writing this book with Larry and Phil Burke. And, and a mathematician named Dan Rockmore. And then later a woman named Sarah Robert. Right. So Larry brought me out there, which was, and really just he and his wife, his, his ex-wife. Then, now Jody, you know, really just took me in and kind of adopted me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Douglas: </b>And I worked there on the book for a year. And then they made a position for me at the, electronic music studios there. They made me the technical director. So for a couple years I did that, and I taught at Dartmouth after almost three years up there. I couldn't, I, I don't like the cold. And I <laugh> and it was very isolated up there other than, I mean, it was a dream because I got to hang out with Larry and Jody and these amazing people that would come through their house. They had this kind of classic house full of artists and interesting people who were always passing through. And that was wonderful. But I just decided I had to go somewhere else after a while, <laugh>. 'cause it was, I couldn't handle another winter. Right. So I wrote to Brad Garten. I had started, when I was at Cal Arts a few years before that, I had started this thing called Music, DSP, this mailing list, that there were lots of amateurs and hobbyists that were starting to use computers to, to make music in various ways, and that it would be good to, you know, have a mailing list for them. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Douglas: </b>And so I started that up and it had a lot of people on it. And so I wrote, I saw an email from Brad that was about a grad student who had applied to their program or something. And I saw that he mentioned they had gotten a grant recently and we're gonna, be expanding their operations a little bit. And so I wrote to him and I said, you know, you've never met me. You don't know who I am, but I'm, I'm gonna quit my job and move to New York City, and I would love to get involved with the Computer Music Center in some way. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> Brad wrote back and said, no, I do know who you are 'cause I'm on the music <span style="color:red" data-ts="1869.405" data-end_ts="1869.765" title="1869.405" id=c_"1869.405">__DSP__</span> list, you know, why don't you come down and we'll chat? And they basically just offered me a job sight unseen, which was pretty amazing. And, you know, for, it's a real testament to Brad's way of, again, he has this, you know, if he, he, he really trusts some people, and, he can tell it's, it's, they're gonna work hard and do their best. And then he, gives 'em a shot. And so he gave me <span style="color:red" data-ts="1895.525" data-end_ts="1895.725" title="1895.525" id=c_"1895.525">__this__</span>, I moved to New York, he gave me a job. And, it's going on 17 years now that I've been there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Wow. That's an amazing, that's an amazing story. Although, I have to admit that it seems like anytime Brad's involved in a story, in the end result, there's gonna be something amazing, right, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Douglas: </b>Yeah. He's, he's good at generating amazing things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>He is speaking of generating amazing things. I mean, you personally have done that as well. You mentioned having started the, the music DSP list, which was really, that was really influential to a lot of people that, that I know. And a lot of people who subsequently became, you know, in one way or another, found, found a way to surround their lives with music and coding. But, another thing that you were involved with that was, the dork was the creation of Dorkbot. And Dorkbot has had a really widespread, a real widespread influence. And I think in a way, it's one of the things that helped combat an idea you talked about earlier, which was this idea of professionalism. What it sort of did, was it, it elevated Dorkbot elevated the interested amateur into being something worth talking about and meeting about and getting a presentation from. You know, it coalesced along with a lot of other things. But I think Dorkbot was really influential in some of that stuff. How did it start? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Douglas: </b>I, I had moved to New York City, and I really literally didn't know anyone. I had briefly met Brad <laugh> and, but I knew, you know, the whole reason to move to New York City, away from this kind of idyllic environment up in New Hampshire and Vermont was that I, I wanted to be involved with interesting people doing interesting stuff. I knew New York City was full of weird things. And so I just kind of had the idea that, well, we have this resource, which is space, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2031.025" data-end_ts="2031.245" title="2031.025" id=c_"2031.025">__the__</span> Computer music center, and we have a computer and a projector and whatnot. So why not just start asking people to come and talk about what they're doing? And that by itself is, is not at all novel in an academic environment. It's totally standard to have people come through and talk about their work or the latest paper they wrote or whatever, but, mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Douglas: </b><affirmative>, I wasn't really interested in that. What I wanted was the people who were, were very broadly, you know, just doing experiments of various sorts. You know, we called it doing strange things with electricity. Right. And, it's, it's not, you know, anti academic in any way, but it's also kind of trying to acknowledge that you don't have to be in academia to be doing worthwhile, weird stuff. So I just started putting the call out on various mailing lists I found in New York City saying, Hey, I'm gonna have this meeting once a month. If you'd like to talk about something you're working on, just send me an email and I'll put you on the schedule. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2094.545" data-end_ts="2094.765" title="2094.545" id=c_"2094.545">__And__</span> it was very purposely not curated. It wasn't that you propose something and I'll decide whether or not it's, it's worth putting on. It was explicitly just like, you're, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2106.305" data-end_ts="2106.525" title="2106.305" id=c_"2106.305">__if__</span> you <span style="color:red" data-ts="2106.735" data-end_ts="2107.085" title="2106.735" id=c_"2106.735">__wanna__</span> give a presentation, you're gonna give a presentation <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Douglas: </b>And we just, we just have to schedule it. And that worked out great. People right away started coming, and started proposing, you know, asking to give presentations. And pretty quickly, because it was, because I was publicizing it on mailing lists that were read not just in New York City, but in other cities as well. And people kind of liked the idea, and I think saw a similar need in their own communities. And so it, it quickly started popping up in, London and Seattle and Gant, and, it just kind of took off. And then people all over the world were doing something they called dopa. Now, there was no coordination, no rules or anything like that. So, you know, there were some fairly different versions of it, but in general, they all shared the notion that, well, this is a, just a, a casual public presentation of some sort of, of things that people are exploring. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I'm, I'm actually a little curious about that though, because it's not always the case that people will see a good idea and say, I want to be part of that good idea, and I'm going to, you know, use the name and, and build, build off of some of the momentum that this thing has. Oftentimes it's like, well, I can do better than that. Did <laugh> and, I'm gonna make, you know, dork hack, hack <span style="color:red" data-ts="2196.605" data-end_ts="2196.825" title="2196.605" id=c_"2196.605">__bot__</span>, or whatever. Right. And, you know, they try and they try and kind of like get their own momentum going. What do you think it is about Dorkbot, whether it's just the name which is disarming and kind of fun? Or is it the, the, just the idea behind it that was so stimulating, people wanted to resonate with it? What do you think caused people to say, yeah, it's a dork butt that I wanna, that I want to be <laugh>? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Douglas: </b>Right. Well, you're right. I mean, it, it is a stupid name. And I should say, I'm just realizing now that I, I, I have a feeling I sound kind of very down and calm, but that's mostly because I have a child sleeping next to me, <laugh>. So I'm <laugh>, I'm purposely being kind of subdued. It is meant to be silly and fun, and it's purposely a stupid name because, so that you can't really take yourself too seriously if you're gonna do something called Dorkbot. Right. So I think that helped, I think that, you know, was attractive to certain kind of people. And also the fact that once they did look clo more closely at it, they realized there weren't a bunch of rules and there wasn't a book, and they didn't have to sign anything. And, you know, it was also a time of a lot of copy fighting and all that kind of stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Douglas: </b>Yeah. And it was very explicitly wide open. There was no ownership, there was no attempt <span style="color:red" data-ts="2277.185" data-end_ts="2277.385" title="2277.185" id=c_"2277.185">__at__</span> control. And so, you know, some things might've happened occasionally that I wasn't terribly comfortable with, but I think if you're willing to just kind of totally give in and really say, look, I don't need to control this thing. It's gonna have its own life. It's gonna do what it's gonna do. Sometimes it works. I'm sure it could have been disastrous as well. And in fact, there's been in the news recently, although it's existed for quite a while, this Microsoft worm called Dork Bod. Oh, nice. Which has really been nasty. But it's, you know, it's been around for about a decade, but only recently was there some major push of shutting down the servers that was running it and et cetera. Now, I don't know if that was inspired by the Dork <span style="color:red" data-ts="2322.785" data-end_ts="2323.005" title="2322.785" id=c_"2322.785">__Bot__</span> meetings or whether maybe someone just invented that name, you know, on their own or what, but, so, I don't <span style="color:red" data-ts="2328.765" data-end_ts="2328.845" title="2328.765" id=c_"2328.765">__know__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Douglas: </b>I think, I think the openness, the, the silliness, certainly some people did not like it and thought the name was, you know, ridiculous and not professional. And so, yeah, I mean, it's, people presenting things they're interested in is not, you know, as I, it's not a particularly novel idea. It was more just kind of orienting it in a certain way and, and trying to have it not be pretentious and not be about, I'm a genius and this is the greatest, this is the idea that's gonna save the world. But rather say it's, it's actually okay to just have creativity be a normal part of your life. And maybe it's in small, seemingly insignificant things, but that's, you know, that's what makes a life 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>True enough. Well, I can't believe that we've already blown through the, the time here. It's, I, I could talk to you forever, I think, but <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Douglas: </b><laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>We'll, we'll try and keep it at our, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Douglas: </b>That's long rambling answers. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>There you go. But it'll be like the three hour cello note. Somebody might like it. Right. <laugh>, I have a million questions I'd like to ask, but I'm gonna try and limit it to a finite number. And one of 'em is <span style="color:red" data-ts="2403.245" data-end_ts="2403.365" title="2403.245" id=c_"2403.245">__a__</span>, the majority of people that are gonna listen to this podcast, Liv, some form of a creative life, whether it's, it's being artistic or being musical, or being a creative coder or whatever they are, they would certainly talk about their lives as having a significantly creative aspect to it. You have, you know, from the sound of it, you have spent a lot of time really thinking and, kind of intuiting what that means, at least for you, but also how you can help help that flower in others without knowing any individual, any individuals we're talking to. What are some generalities that you would suggest as either areas of study or areas of self-examination or things to think about, or things to specifically not think about? What would you offer to people to help them, more fully realize their artistic lives? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Douglas: </b>Wow. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>No pressure man, <laugh>. Gosh. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Douglas: </b>Well, I, I think one way to approach that is first to acknowledge that, that the way I work and the way I teach and the way I think about things works really well for some people. And for people, it's, it's a complete train wreck. You know, they, they, for instance, in, when I teach my classes, I, I usually get a few people who say, wow, this is really fantastic. It really meant a lot to me, and I didn't learn anything in particular. But, you know, I'm feeling inspired. And then I also get a few people on the other end who say, this is the dumbest, most useless class. I really wanted to like it, but boy, this was a waste of my time. And then there's often mostly people in the middle who are just kind of like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2519.565" data-end_ts="2519.845" title="2519.565" id=c_"2519.565">__well__</span>, I'm confused. And there <span style="color:red" data-ts="2521.445" data-end_ts="2521.605" title="2521.445" id=c_"2521.445">__were__</span> some good videos we watched, but I'm not really sure what this was about. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Douglas: </b>So it's not, I, I, I definitely don't have a magic formula. I have a, a way of thinking about things that, that works for a few people now and then, and that way I think is, works really well for people who are extremely self-directed, who, you know, need to find things out for themselves who are very comfortable kind of doing their own research and following, you know, following the rabbit hole where it takes them. And, one thing I do try to do is encourage <span style="color:red" data-ts="2557.165" data-end_ts="2557.325" title="2557.165" id=c_"2557.165">__and__</span> people who don't feel that impulse to find a way to give themselves freedom, to, to try it out. Often <span style="color:red" data-ts="2565.325" data-end_ts="2565.605" title="2565.325" id=c_"2565.325">__there__</span> people who feel, they're being judged a lot, who feel a lot of external pressure. Maybe it's from parents <span style="color:red" data-ts="2572.545" data-end_ts="2572.765" title="2572.545" id=c_"2572.545">__off__</span> very often, it's from parents, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2575.945" data-end_ts="2576.165" title="2575.945" id=c_"2575.945">__to__</span> succeed in some way. And when success is really not very well defined, and especially from the arts, there's kind of no, definition of success that I Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Douglas: </b>That I can see. So, you know, I guess that would be the main thing is, is find a way to give yourself permission to be kind of useless, or at the very least to, to admit that you don't know what's gonna be useful and you don't know how things are gonna turn out. And that it's, it's a real privilege to be in a position where you can do useless things. And if you are in that position, you really ought to go for it. You know, you really ought to exploit that as fully as you can. So, to be an artist who's not gonna make any money as an artist who is not gonna get any recognition, who is probably, you know, in all likelihood, not gonna be some sort of star, and yet to live in fear of doing the wrong thing, or, or not being, not doing something that's prestigious enough, or, or, or not having people think that you're fancy or whatever it is, just seems absurd to me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Douglas: </b>And yet that's a fear that lots of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2645.205" data-end_ts="2645.325" title="2645.205" id=c_"2645.205">__cra__</span> creative people end up having. So I guess that would really be it. Just trying to foster this, this orientation that seems kind of defeatist, which is that it really doesn't matter. You know, what you're doing. You're not being judged, no one's paying attention to you. And it's almost a variation on the classical classic kind of philosophical question of, well, what do you do if no one is watching? You know, if there is no, God, if no one is judging you, how should you behave? Right. And in a way, I think that's the position of artists. No one is watching you. And so what are you gonna do now? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm gonna leave it there. 'cause that's a, that's a fantastic place to place to put it. I want to thank you so much for your time and for bearing with me as we, did this a second time. But it was, I think worth it. We actually took a completely different track this time than we did last. And, good for us, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Douglas: </b><laugh>. Well, you're, you're a wonderful, conversation pal Darwin I really appreciate it. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm looking forward to my next trip to New York. I'm gonna make sure that we, we grab a beer <span style="color:red" data-ts="2712.145" data-end_ts="2712.365" title="2712.145" id=c_"2712.145">__in__</span> a nice restaurant someplace and continue this conversation. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Douglas: </b>That sounds great. Alright. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thank you so much. Have a great evening and, thanks again. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Douglas: </b>Okay. Talk to you soon. Bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, here I sit in my hotel room in Anaheim, having just had another interesting NAMM show. I did a few foolish things, sorry to all those who were affected. I did a lot of great visits with a lot of good friends. Some of the people that I consider my namm friends, people I really respect, but <span style="color:red" data-ts="2750.405" data-end_ts="2750.685" title="2750.405" id=c_"2750.405">__will__</span> only get a chance to see once a year. And, I also had a great time with my coworkers while I was here as well. So, all in all, a good trip. I hope that you enjoyed, the visit with Douglas. It was an amazing talk. He's an amazing guy. If you have a chance to check out his work, please do that. But otherwise, I'm exhausted. I'm gonna bag <span style="color:red" data-ts="2773.245" data-end_ts="2773.405" title="2773.245" id=c_"2773.245">__it__</span>. I'll catch you next week. Bye.
