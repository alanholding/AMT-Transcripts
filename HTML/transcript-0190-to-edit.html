<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, today I have the opportunity to get, to get a chance to talk to somebody. His name is Devin Fleener. I got a reach out from somebody that's on a team that he's working with on a project, and the whole thing caught my attention. And so, I jumped on on the horn and luckily Devin was able to spend a little time talking to me before he heads off to the mu <span style="color:red" data-ts="37.165" data-end_ts="37.365" title="37.165" id=c_"37.165">__tech__</span> festival. So, with that, let's, let's say hello to Devin. Hey, Devin, how are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Devin Fleenor / S.E.E.D.: </b>I am well, and, thank you for having me, man. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I appreciate you taking the time. I know you're just getting ready to hit the road, so I appreciate you kind of squeezing me in at the last minute. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Devin: </b>Yeah, of course. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, to begin with, why don't you fill us in a little bit on, on your work, both your, the bigger picture work, but specifically this, this project you're working on right now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Devin: </b>Okay. Well, I am a media artist of sorts. I work a lot with, space spaces, and creating, immersive experiences. The path that I've taken kind <span style="color:red" data-ts="82.685" data-end_ts="82.805" title="82.685" id=c_"82.685">__of__</span> started with, music, when I was young, that was my outlet. And I, created, tried to create music however I could with rudimentary devices at first. But, so I create, I was creating a type of electronic music of sorts as I got into my old, you know, twenties and that kind of thing, and started getting much more <span style="color:red" data-ts="102.625" data-end_ts="102.845" title="102.625" id=c_"102.625">__in__</span>, you know, interested and passionate about the visual. <span style="color:red" data-ts="105.645" data-end_ts="105.765" title="105.645" id=c_"105.645">__A__</span> as I, you know, kind of jumped into a project in my, I late twenties, 30 early thirties, that opened up the doorway. We went on tour and I bought my first lasers, and we had a whole bunch of, every part of the show had video projections, and custom visuals that we'd made. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Devin: </b>Fortunately for us, like myself and Blaine, who was one of my collaborators <span style="color:red" data-ts="130.545" data-end_ts="130.765" title="130.545" id=c_"130.545">__or__</span> both visual artists, we got into, a heavy visual experience, you know, and that was kind of, a big shift for me. And from that point on, when I got back from that tour, I, I've, I've kind of transitioned more and more into creating spaces and taking, taking, light and sound and, and kind of trying to work with people's imaginations and really create something that's hopefully unusual for them. And that has kind of fed right into seed, which is the project that I've been working on for the last two and a half years. SEED stands for Stellar Emissions Encapsulation Device. And the idea there is, there's multiple levels of star reference, <span style="color:red" data-ts="177.245" data-end_ts="177.525" title="177.245" id=c_"177.245">__what__</span>, you know, 'cause my original concept was for this to be a solar powered in installation. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Devin: </b>And, and it will be, currently we haven't implemented that full solar plan, but that's on the way. But the idea there also is just that this device isn't so much, an artwork that tells a narrative from an artist from the very beginning. I kind of, I imagine this entity, a sort of autonomous, mysterious entity that was somewhat connected to distant places, distant, but also yet very close. And part of our, of, you know, a very intimate feeling kind of in that, in that piece. And so seed for me was, I, I, I didn't want it to ever feel like I was telling a story or is issuing a dogma or creating some sort of direct messaging and more so that it was an exploratory platform, and that the people who partook in, the people that observed <span style="color:red" data-ts="233.565" data-end_ts="233.765" title="233.565" id=c_"233.565">__in__</span> the people that interacted with it were just as much as the of the artist and the storyteller and the, the navigator of this exploration portal. And so that's kind of the vision for <span style="color:red" data-ts="243.525" data-end_ts="243.805" title="243.525" id=c_"243.525">__Seed__</span> in a, in a nutshell. That's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Very interesting. And it, it's especially interesting because so often artists are really nervous about giving up control of the storytelling, right. Giving up control of the narrative. That seems to be, for a lot of people, that seems to be the artwork. Right. So it seems it seems almost strange to say that you're willing to let it go. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Devin: </b>Well, I, I, I think so. I think you're right. There <span style="color:red" data-ts="268.865" data-end_ts="269.085" title="268.865" id=c_"268.865">__are__</span> a lot of different people doing art for a lot of different reasons. And, and I think that it's great when, an artist has something important to say and wants to use their art form as a, as a conduit for communicating and relating with people. It's, I mean, and it's, yeah, it's part of the whole reason why people do art, I think, you know, to be able to tell their story or to tell a story or to communicate. And I, and I feel like I, I definitely identify with that. And in the bigger picture, this piece coming into fruition and existing even is kind of my way of communicating, right? That's my narrative. Right, right. <laugh>. But it, but in the experience itself, I didn't want it to feel, I wanted to be able to just <laugh>. So it's like, it's a layer of abstraction, I guess. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. It's almost the making, the making of the piece was your narrative, not what the resultant piece is. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Devin: </b>Yeah. And I also wanted to make this be a much bigger thing, you know, like, I didn't want it to be about, oh, this is a piece by Devon <span style="color:red" data-ts="329.665" data-end_ts="330.085" title="329.665" id=c_"329.665">__Feller__</span>, but more so a platform where we could collaborate with lots of different people. And that's what it's kind of become. <span style="color:red" data-ts="336.185" data-end_ts="336.405" title="336.185" id=c_"336.185">__And__</span> the <span style="color:red" data-ts="336.605" data-end_ts="336.805" title="336.605" id=c_"336.605">__see__</span> the team of Seed is quite a amazing collection of, <span style="color:red" data-ts="340.105" data-end_ts="340.325" title="340.105" id=c_"340.105">__of__</span> brilliant people from whether they be more on the academic side or just a purely, interactive artists. We have a bunch of amazing coders and, and different types of designers. We have an amazing industrial designer that's handling all the fabrication and just all the little details that make a museum caliber piece, you know, so all these people are just, are taking their little role. We're all, excited about how far this thing might go, you know, because we, because of what we're aiming for, we're really, it's really kind of, incredible, like how the, the organic progression of, resonant people have has kind of gathered us just this little crew of magicians. And things are, it's been, it's been amazing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's interesting too, you just kinda mentioned a couple of things I want to dive into more. First of all, you mentioned fabrication, and unlike a lot of space oriented things, nor normally when you see people talking about space in relation to, artwork, normally it's like site specific installations and stuff like that, right? Where Sure. They come into space and they utilize that space. You're actually making something that is a standalone piece that, that you take the space with you. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Devin: </b>Right. I mean, this seed is basically a eight foot cube, some glass, some acrylic, some aluminum and magnesium. But yeah, it's basically, it looks like just a, it looks like a giant aquarium of some seamless, it's not 360, but it's, yeah, it, it, it definitely is a self-contained kind of device. But with, you know, with surround sound, having a quadraphonic, sound system, and then just the fact that this thing is capable emitting such incredible amounts of intensity as far as light that the whole room, you know, 40 foot long, you know, chamber in, in the museum lights, when it's at full blast, the whole room is incredibly lit up, you know? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, because we're using, because of the LED wall is incredibly bright. The, all of the RGB lasers, when they all fire out and pure white, it be everything becomes almost so bright that it's, it's not comfortable to look at. Wow. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So now for people, in the show notes, we'll definitely put in a link where they can kind of get a visual. But why don't you explain what the experience <span style="color:red" data-ts="481.405" data-end_ts="481.565" title="481.405" id=c_"481.405">__is__</span>, is for someone that, someone that enters this art piece, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Devin: </b>Well, you walk into a dark space, fairly dark. I mean, not pitch black, but a nondescript darkness as you enter in, if there's no one in this space, you'll find that the seed device is kind of in a hypnotic state, a dream-like state with very mild and minor activity as kind of hypnagogic imagery of sorts. If you can imagine this device entity having these little dream lits. But we have motion captures, in the room. And so we, we know when people enter in and we know how close they are to the device. And in con in content of the entire room, when you enter in and the, the device and then the motion sensors tracked that you're there, it's, it scans you in some kind of way. It's like you little sound effect. And it's like you, you immediately kind of tell that, Hey, the device is aware and just sense something and kind of gives you this little like, first initial feedback of, Hey, I see you Mm-Hmm, <affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Devin: </b>And that's kind of begins the transition of this thing to waking up. And that's when, you know, you start to see different types of feedback and different types of things happening. We have multiple cameras in the space, so like, you might notice that as you move a little bit in front of the device that you see, like the old school psychedelic analog feedback where you start to and starts to trail off <span style="color:red" data-ts="568.665" data-end_ts="568.885" title="568.665" id=c_"568.665">__in__</span>, into infinity. Now we're able to, to modulate all that dynamically and do some really cool stuff with software, obviously. So we have a, a lot of interesting processing, a lot of things going on. We're also doing a lot with time glitching, so you might see yourself and think, Hey, that's me doing this. And then all of a sudden you realize, no, that's what I was doing a minute ago. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Devin: </b><laugh> <laugh>. Which is really fun, because we're also can do that with the audio in the room. So if somebody's laughing or somebody says something to someone in a, in a quiet close way, you know, I might, they might hear that whispered back in a glitched up, chopped up fashion, you know, five minutes later, which is a little bit of just for fun, you know, basically having a fun time with that. And it's, and it's so easy to do with the technology. Those kind of little tricks are just like, just little bits of, of audio, entertainment, you know? And so as you're coming closer to the device, you know, you might have a group of people with you, and it's gonna kind of sense the movement energy and <span style="color:red" data-ts="627.725" data-end_ts="627.845" title="627.725" id=c_"627.725">__in__</span> the proximity. And there's a lot of things that will go on. And as the, the music will start to, to become more aroused, there's, the lasers on in some way, <span style="color:red" data-ts="639.125" data-end_ts="639.405" title="639.125" id=c_"639.125">__will__</span>, might, will start creating geometric patterns as people get in the more, you know, closer ranges of this thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Devin: </b>And it starts to, you know, it starts to become kind of a, a, storyteller of its sorts. It's kind of the, the music that we're doing for this piece is all generative and all algorithmic, so it can be controlled by the brain of the piece and, and with direct inputs of obviously everything that people are doing. But that being said, it was really important for me. And I think that just my background in being a musician and, and wanting to understand, you know, really just having a very, a strong love of music that I didn't want this piece to sound, it just couldn't ever sound like a experimental, interactive art piece where it just kind of has this kind of robotic bleepity, bloop, you know, analog, modular synthesis, synthesizer, kind of just doing sound effects. And you hear that a lot in these types of installations and in this piece, it could not be that it had to ha, this piece is, has to sound like a entity with a personality and with a voice and with emotion, you know, it's, it needed to be really emotive and very, very, like connecting on that emotional level so that when you leave the place, you kind of walk away almost like you had seen a concert and, and you'd seen a band or something where you're like, I, I remember the way that sounds. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Devin: </b>It has a very unique voice. And, and so that was, so that's kind of, you know, a very critical part of this piece. And the design stuff we're working on right now, actually, you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Talk about it in very personality terms, right? You talk about it, you know, kind of hibernating and having this state that it comes awake, but also about how you want it to, I mean, again, so often with this kind of art that a point of the art, a pointed part of it is to say, look, this is machinery doing it. It seems like you're literally going the opposite way. You want to say, no, this is an entity and it, you know, it doesn't matter what it's made of, it's, it's a being. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Devin: </b>Yeah. That's the, the, the goal. I mean, clearly it's, a challenge to try to pull off because, and we're only gonna, you know, we're only gonna be able to do it so well <span style="color:red" data-ts="771.425" data-end_ts="771.645" title="771.425" id=c_"771.425">__in__</span> a certain level, and then we're gonna reevaluate and analyze how, how that all went down. We'll keep developing. And that's the cool part about artificial intelligence. 'cause you can, you can get going with artificial intelligence, and I know I jumped into it that kind of felt like maybe a, a quick weird segue, <laugh>, but with artificial intelligence, you can get in into this, into that world with simple machine learning. But then you can get super, super, super deep and complex in, in deep nets with like very, very elaborate neural networks. And you could have machines all over the world processing your data in real time. And it could get really, really next level very quickly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Devin: </b>But related to the experience, just to finish off <span style="color:red" data-ts="812.085" data-end_ts="812.365" title="812.085" id=c_"812.085">__your__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="812.695" data-end_ts="813.045" title="812.695" id=c_"812.695">__there__</span>, there's this next level that we have that we get to with the piece, and it's a touch. There's six pressure sensitive touch sensors on the glass on the front of the, of the device shaped in the hexagon. There's a lot of hexagonal triangular geometry, throughout the entire piece. And the design and the position of the lasers and the mirrors and everything that's happening kind of is really, based on the math, the geometry of Metatron's cube. You know, I, I started looking at Metatron's Cube as a three-dimensional object, which it's really a cube inside of a cube, and all the points are, and it's rotes with a certain rotation. But anyway, the point is, is as soon as you start touching these hexagon pressure sensitive pads, you enter a whole nother level of things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Devin: </b>Just get much more interesting. The lasers, you're, it's like you start to kind of, you have all these different modes of operation where like, you're, well, sometimes it feels like a call and response where you're playing an instrument, not one that you can really grasp all <span style="color:red" data-ts="871.905" data-end_ts="872.125" title="871.905" id=c_"871.905">__the__</span> way, but you can tell that you're definitely playing something and then the machine comes back and responds and, you know, and has like a, a compatible response to what you've just played. And then there's this idea that you, you're just unlocking different types of visual modes, different types of symbolism, different types of sound, and it's just, it's very tactile and it's just a really incredibly in interesting kind of communication device slash discovery instrument of sort. Obviously there's always this kinda sense of unpredictability and the fact that the Nancy, it's is still there, even though you're, it's never quite like you have full control <span style="color:red" data-ts="910.085" data-end_ts="910.285" title="910.085" id=c_"910.085">__of__</span> like a piano where, where, you know, it's like, I hit the key and the thing makes the note. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Devin: </b>So it's not, it's not ever that, that direct, there's a little bit of resistance, a little bit of, ambiguity. And those things add to this kind of sense of, you know, a wonder in awe, like, what's next? What, what could happen? Why did the laser just all shut off? Right. You know, like, so we, we get, we wanna keep the people who are playing with it understand, you know, feeling very connected and definitely feeling, knowing that they, what they do is they're, they're <span style="color:red" data-ts="938.765" data-end_ts="938.885" title="938.765" id=c_"938.765">__far__</span> recognized. And it's, it's never a puppeting puppeting kind of dynamic. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The Metatrons cube thing kind of implies this thing where, you know, it's almost, it's almost multidimensional in that you can find patterns in small or greater areas. It's almost like a different form of fractal behaviors Absolutely. Or whatever, right? Yep. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Devin: </b>Very similar. In fact, a lot of the fractals are based on the golden ratio. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, that's all in Metatron's cube. And then, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="966.525" data-end_ts="966.685" title="966.525" id=c_"966.525">__then__</span> seed, we, within that, that Metatron's cube, we, we do a lot with golden rectangles <span style="color:red" data-ts="971.865" data-end_ts="972.085" title="971.865" id=c_"971.865">__in__</span> there. The thing is, is when you start playing with the golden ratio and feedback, now you've got fractals. I see. And so we're, we're like right in there in that niche, that nook. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So I am curious about something, one of the things I like to explore in my podcast is, how people get into, into the things that they're, into. The person who reached out to me about you sort of like, kind of identified you as, a DIY developer, thinker, marketer, artist, you know, they basically said, you know, you're sort of like, do everything. And that's how you define yourself. As you talk about the development of this, I can see where that's coming from. You seem to really have excitement and kind of ownership of a lot of different areas in this thing, whether it's the sound of it or the nature of it, or the graphic repre representations, all this stuff. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1034.185" data-end_ts="1034.405" title="1034.185" id=c_"1034.185">__It__</span>, it's really important to you. I'm curious about what in your background, put you in a position to sort of be able to juggle all of these kinds of things in a, in a way that makes for an interesting, makes for the interesting artists that you are? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Devin: </b>I think really a lot of it ties into my computer, experiences. And when I think I was like seven when I first really understood what a computer was, and then how I started to learn about it. And I think by the time I was eight, my grandparents bought me my first home computer, and I started, they also, I think they also got me a couple books and maybe a class for like, the weekend. It was <span style="color:red" data-ts="1073.045" data-end_ts="1073.165" title="1073.045" id=c_"1073.045">__like__</span>, kind of like a, you know, I think they taught us basic. It was the, like, one of the very first kind of home computers, common languages. I just dove in and I spent a lot of time, like I just had a natural affinity to that. It really did kind of change my, I was <span style="color:red" data-ts="1089.165" data-end_ts="1089.365" title="1089.165" id=c_"1089.165">__all__</span>, I just kept going and going with that, not properly, obviously. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Devin: </b>And, you know, back then in grade school and high school, like <span style="color:red" data-ts="1095.925" data-end_ts="1096.365" title="1095.925" id=c_"1095.925">__whoever__</span>, you know, knowing how to use computer or program a computer was, people thought it was cool. But there, there weren't computer programming classes and, you know, I, it was early enough that that just wasn't really much a thing. I mean, in high school they had a computer class, but it was just so that people could know what they were and, you know, <laugh> like how to type a document and, you know, just like the basic, basic stuff. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1117.045" data-end_ts="1117.245" title="1117.045" id=c_"1117.045">__So__</span> yeah, that really shaped everything. So when the internet, when I first got exposed to the internet in two, in 1996, I made my fir, you know, someone taught me HTML, and I just started. And I just, the internet totally has been a medium of just incredible connectivity. And, you know, like it's been, it's just been a, an invaluable resource for me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Devin: </b>I've been one of those kind of people that's learned how to script things, how to automate things, how to communicate through all these channels and, and figuring out ways to syndicate bits of information properly. And so I, I just, I think I'm, I'm, in some ways I'm a strategist. I really love puzzles and I love, to me the internet and how you could with no virtually no resources that or no, proper training kind of take over the world, you know, <laugh> <laugh>, it's really incredible. And I've, I've just been, I kind, you know, the band <span style="color:red" data-ts="1172.405" data-end_ts="1172.645" title="1172.405" id=c_"1172.405">__where__</span> that, we booked that tour, we booked a nine week tour across 17 countries in Europe. That was all DIY that was literally, we just, I mean, we created music videos. And this was back in the, you know, like 2007 to 2008, we started making music videos for this project. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Devin: </b>And there weren't a lot of people making cool music videos for, in like, indie projects. And so we were kind of doing stuff that we could really milk and mar, you know, people resonated. And so we, we got to quite a following on YouTube for an independent band that didn't have any, you know, we didn't have a label or, so I think at one point we had like 12,000, you know, YouTube subscribers. And so I wrote, I wrote a little script that, messaged all of them. I basically wrote, messaged every one of our followers on YouTube. And I was like, Hey, we're considering doing a European tour. If you happen to know anyone that might be able to be helpful, like a, it could be a, you know, a venue or a radio person or a somebody <span style="color:red" data-ts="1225.705" data-end_ts="1225.925" title="1225.705" id=c_"1225.705">__of__</span> books shows or if you know someone, just let us know.

<b>Devin: </b>Write us back. And I, I misspoke. We didn't send it to every one of our subscriber subscribers. We sent it to every one of our subscribers that lived in Europe. Oh, right, okay. We had like 1200 positive responses, <laugh>, and we booked all those countries, and we booked all those shows, and we, we did, did it all like, just through the goodwill of like a network through people that we, that happen to wanna help. And so that's kind <span style="color:red" data-ts="1255.525" data-end_ts="1255.645" title="1255.525" id=c_"1255.525">__of__</span> a, a sample of the kind of way that I've approached things. You know, it's just like, let's just try it and let's just like, use the tools that we have available to us and, and see what happens. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, you come across as kind of fearless, quite frankly. And, you know, it's, it's fearless to just say, we wanna go on a European tour and I'm gonna message a whole bunch of people. And the fact that it worked out <span style="color:red" data-ts="1279.565" data-end_ts="1279.725" title="1279.565" id=c_"1279.565">__is__</span> great. Right. And it seems like you're kind of, I mean, I think for a lot of people, some of the ideas you have behind the seed project would seem to be too big. Right. But it seems like you're a little bit fearless and you're like, I, I gotta do it. I have to give it a try. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Devin: </b>I don't know if it's fearless, but I definitely <span style="color:red" data-ts="1299.945" data-end_ts="1300.165" title="1299.945" id=c_"1299.945">__am__</span>, I'm definitely a fan of confronting your fears. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, and I think you can be afraid, but if you're willing to admit it and you're willing to at least face it, you can continue to move. You can continue, you know, you're not paralyzed by it. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Devin: </b>I, I think I'm afraid all the time, <laugh> <laugh>, I, I'm confused all the time. I'm very much, oftentimes feel like I'm wandering in the dark, you know, moving forward and just with just the instinct of maybe which way I should be heading. But yeah, in a lot of ways I do think I, I understand and I agree. I mean, and I do not allow the general perception of difficulty to be much of a factor. I end up having to scale back my designs. I was so dismissive of the difficulty that I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1345.125" data-end_ts="1345.285" title="1345.125" id=c_"1345.125">__can__</span>, you know, at some point that difficulty is a, like a, a law of physics or some sort of hard, you know, resource limitation. And it smacks you in the face and, you know, you're optimistic, you know, dismissal of it, you know, has to be addressed. So like, I'm, you know, I definitely have to deal with that side of it, you know, just, there's the reality of these things. And, and, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1366.725" data-end_ts="1366.925" title="1366.725" id=c_"1366.725">__mean__</span> that's, and that's a good thing to start, you know, it's a good way to start your vision. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1370.395" data-end_ts="1370.685" title="1370.395" id=c_"1370.395">__It's__</span> why would you want plan for an artistic project or a venture or a business or anything where you're just aiming for like the, the real reasonable, practical middle of the road goal? <laugh>? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. You, you know, it sounds hilarious when you say it that way, but I swear, I think a lot of people, that's one of their first and most primary decision making tools is what can I imagine myself being able to do fairly easily? Right. And that's the starting point for what they do. And that's, that's such a set of handcuffs. It's not funny. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Devin: </b>I think you're right. I think a lot of it has to do with how you were raised, what your parents tell you about what's possible is that's gonna affect what you believe is possible about in a lot, in a lot of ways. And I was extremely fortunate to be raised by, you know, loving parents, but my grandparents in particular were like, so supportive. And they, I think, you know, they recognize, they're like, Devon's really smart, so we should just really, like, we're gonna give him every possible opportunity that we can as far as, and, and then most of that was in the form of just learning and, encouraging me to be like, you know, you can do whatever the fuck you dream up. It's possible you could pull it off. And if you hear that all the time growing up as a kid, you're gonna believe it. Right. And I think it's so important. It's, that's why, you know, education is so important. And so I, it's unfortunate, but many, many people are not given that message. So we have some neural regeneration that we need to work on, work on our way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So now, one of the things I noticed in the information I got is that in addition to being an art piece that is, that is gonna be shown and stuff, you're also interacting with, folks at Ryerson Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> to do some academic research on sort of like a therapeutic methodology or, or a, a therapeutic angle to working with this kind of device. Can you fill me in a little bit about what that means? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Devin: </b>It's extremely important to me. And I dropped out of grad school, to go on tour. Actually, my goal, I mean, my, my interest was neuroscience, I mean, neuropsychology to be specific. Okay. And I just didn't do very well with grad school. There was a lot of hoops to jump through, a lot of arbitrary tasks and things of that nature. And I, I just don't do well with those. And so I, I got real impatient with that. So I don't think proper academia is really my path. So I've al but I've always wanted to be in that realm. You know, to me it was like that to me, scientists were like, those are the people that I most respected artists, obviously. I do respect, I have great respect for many artists, but like, to me, also scientists were like, that, that guy's awesome. You know, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Devin: </b>And so my idea to be able to link art and science is not new. It's just, it's probably been in the back of my head since I was younger. 'cause I really, really like, I really have always enjoyed that. And I, and I think that I've also had this kind of idea that they're similar, you know, like science is <span style="color:red" data-ts="1559.165" data-end_ts="1559.285" title="1559.165" id=c_"1559.165">__an__</span> art, and there's science in art and art of, of doing science, and they're really not all that divergent. And so with this idea of therapy, I was just, you know, I, being a fan of these kinds of things, I, I've always been up on the research and there's just a lot of research coming on the, you know, last decade really getting going that shows brain tissue growth differences in people who are experiencing these different kinds of therapies, both with just music and consuming art, being creative, using your body movement. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Devin: </b>And so, meaning what they're doing is they're able to track using MRIs, brain tissue changes, it's night and day. And it's, it's the same kind of thing they're doing now with psychedelic research. People are doing a lot of this with taking psilocybin or LSD while take doing brain, scans and seeing what types of different neural pathways are being developed. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and, and do and do they last. And that's, and we, we definitely do find that these new pathways are persistent. So the, the, the research that, you know, if you can give somebody the ability to create <span style="color:red" data-ts="1630.305" data-end_ts="1630.525" title="1630.305" id=c_"1630.305">__of__</span> some sort with their, hand and gesture or whatever, and then you find out that that's not only just giving them general improvement of wellness and mood and happiness, but when you're able to show brain tissue changes like that, it's pretty a miraculous kind of thing in my mind. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Devin: </b>Right. We are just at the beginning of this process, we're just literally linked up with Ryerson in the last month. Okay. And so all this stuff is kind of just happening and we're, we're developing our abstracts to get ethics approval, which is, they're gonna be submitted actually this week or probably tomorrow. Okay. Once we get <span style="color:red" data-ts="1665.365" data-end_ts="1665.645" title="1665.365" id=c_"1665.365">__ethics__</span> approval, then we're gonna do some preliminary data collection and, and analysis. So it's like, here's one big part of this. We use a camera inside the device that is able to, when someone's in that touch, that touch range when they're actually touching the sensors Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, that's when we're able to lock in and grab their facial features and their facial, expressions. So we're analyzing hand recording their facial motions and movements, which in a way allows us to track positive emotion, right? So if they're smiling or they have this sense of awe or like excitement, we, we know that, and we can, we can track that in real time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Devin: </b>So that is a really great tool for indication of what's going on in someone's mind. But not only are we using as a, as a data factor for our research, along with, heart rate variability and some other things, some qual qualitative, surveys and different things. But that positive emotion is also this the kind of the, the main data source for our artificial intelligence algorithms. So what we're doing is we are able to judge and determine what types of factors, colors, certain hues, certain tempos, certain types of chord progressions. And we can have these key factors and we can go back and forth and try to figure out what types of things are triggering this enhanced positive emotion response and this individual. And then we can make note of that everything's being recorded, but we can also dial it in, in real time to give them more of whatever it is we think they like. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Do you, do you worry at all that it actually could be, it could be too much. Well, first of all, was this thing not debuted at, currents at one point? Yeah. Yeah. That's where it first was, was shown, right? Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Devin: </b>Yeah. That was a very beta type <span style="color:red" data-ts="1774.705" data-end_ts="1774.925" title="1774.705" id=c_"1774.705">__of__</span> version in my mind. We kind of think in <span style="color:red" data-ts="1776.965" data-end_ts="1777.125" title="1776.965" id=c_"1776.965">__our__</span>, and we always kind of refer to it as a beta, but yeah, it was like, it was like, for us it was, we had to do that. So in June of, yeah, June of last year, 2016, we showed set it up and built it and took it to Current's new media festival, which was a great experience. And we learned a ton. It was like bootcamp for everyone. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I love that. I love that festival so much. I, I love the people that run that. But that means that you have put people through this thing, right? Yeah. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And so what I meant by that is you put a fair number of people through this thing, right? How much did you have to sort of like, dial it in or dial it back or push? I mean, did you find you have to initially make some sort of assumptions Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> on what people, like, did you ever find that it was like, if things were too enjoyable and you kept on pushing that button, that it would take it like over a bad edge or, I mean, I'm just kinda curious like what the reaction of people were, especially in the early parts. 'cause I, I have never done an art piece that was at least I imagine it to be kind of like having the potential of being overwhelming and kind of invasive. Right. I've never really done anything that like that. And so I'm curious about the process you went through to like trial it and then, and then with early users tweak it and what, what did that look like and what were some of the things that you found maybe surprised you or maybe, disappointed you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Devin: </b>Well, first of all, we didn't have the machine learning component going on, in, at currents. Oh, I see. Okay. So what we did have are, you know, certain kind of thresholds where based on how close they were, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1879.585" data-end_ts="1879.805" title="1879.585" id=c_"1879.585">__the__</span>, the, the proximity effect was, was our main indicator. So we were tracking people with multiple cameras in the space, and we would navigate different moods or different types of operatives states based on their proximity. We, we, yeah. There wasn't the facial recognition camera, there wasn't any artificial artificial intelligence yet. So right now, I'll give you a quick summation of where we're at. The idea is it's a very subtle thing that we're doing, and I'm more concerned about just making sure that we're able to track and identify things that, and that we're recording all this data. Because I see this as all very much like an initial kind of creating a framework, a foundation. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Devin: </b>So I'm not looking to really like crank up the feedback loop per se, <laugh> to get, you know, get the, the amp squealing. I'm not, we're not going for that <laugh>, you know, this is, this is gonna be a very subtle thing. And, and the reality is, is when we go back after the fact and analyze this data, we're gonna be like, okay, we can map out all this data and we can really learn like what's going on better over the, a few months probably of analyzing all this. Then, then what we're gonna be able to pull off real time. So what might happen is if somebody seems to really, really enjoy certain types of chord progressions, these, diminished minor chords or whatever they, whatever they resonate with, we can take note of that and we can, we can weight those types of chord progressions higher. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Devin: </b>And I, I don't think that that's ever, would ever be overwhelming for someone. Same thing with colors and hues. If people are really, really into red or people are really, really into yellow, I think that there's a, there's definitely a, there's moments of intensity, but I think there's also gonna be moments of minimal, lots of moments of very spacious, and I, I'm always pursuing minimalism and everything that I'm doing. So even as complicated as all this is, I'm always like, let's get rid of more of this stuff. Let's dial it back and darken it. Let's black it out for a minute. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's interesting you say that because quite frankly, one of the things I was wondering is how much this ends up being like a William s Burroughs style pleasure machine or something, right? Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Devin: </b>I mean, it'd be kind of cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I guess it would be <laugh>, it would definitely make a splash, that's for sure. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Devin: </b>Like, I mean, that's not the worst case, the scenario. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Good point. So anyway, it's, yeah, you're right. That's, that's not the worst case scenario, but it is, it is does kind of point to a lot of potential futures. And it, and it actually seems like you're already starting to explore some and talking about some, you're talking about, you know, over time being able to ramp up the machine learning aspects of this and over time, being able to get more data from the users and stuff like this. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, what are like the mid to long-term futures for a technology or a framework like this? What, what do you imagine this becoming? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Devin: </b>Well, I think that the approach and the escalation of artificial intelligence is, is definitely, it's something that is unexposed to the masses, and most of us don't think a lot about it, and yet it's coming rather quickly. And I think that there's gonna be a real escalation over the next 20 years in artificial intelligence. So that's gonna kind of probably overshadow the artificial intelligence shifts that will occur are gonna overshadow anything that I <laugh> that I'm probably doing with the technology. But that being said, I think that that's really where my mindset is at. Like, how can we use, a device both in an artistic sense and in a therapeutic medical, scientific sense to really give someone an incredibly dialed in custom treatment and or, experience and or whatever that we're giving them, connection love. Maybe we can simulate that we, that maybe we can simulate love. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Devin: </b>Yeah. I, I don't know how or what that looks like, but you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2122.545" data-end_ts="2122.765" title="2122.545" id=c_"2122.545">__the__</span> the point is, is we can do some really incredible things with, with artificial intelligence technology and the way things are going. And I think that's been a big problem in, in the medical profession <span style="color:red" data-ts="2134.645" data-end_ts="2134.805" title="2134.645" id=c_"2134.645">__and__</span> psychology, that we tend to try to put people in boxes. We try to say, you have this disorder, this is the kind of things that you're suffering with, so we're gonna probably give you <span style="color:red" data-ts="2143.325" data-end_ts="2143.525" title="2143.325" id=c_"2143.325">__the__</span> medication A or B or C, these kind of one size fits all kind of, diagnoses and, and treatments. And so I think that for really that's gonna shift the, of the incoming, progress that's made with artificial intelligence. I think our research will just grow much more elaborate. And I think we'll be working with EEGs. I think we'll be working with F MRIs. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Devin: </b>I think we'll be working with different types of, amazing open CV technologies, as <span style="color:red" data-ts="2173.165" data-end_ts="2173.325" title="2173.165" id=c_"2173.165">__is__</span> computer vision, which we, we will be able to do more and more and more with understanding someone. And I, I just, I feel like we might be treading on some kind of controversial and maybe even, threatening activities because think about, you know, an art piece like seed two generations from now, or one generation from now where it's in multiple cities and it's, they're all interconnected via the cloud. All the data is stored online. So, and then we can imagine we're keeping track of everyone so that when you come up and you touch it, we are able to gather a lot more of your bio data. We recognize who you are by face. We put an identification on you. And now anytime you were to show up in any of our systems, we would know, we would be like, we'd be like, Hey, that's Darwin and we, here's this entire bank of information of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2224.065" data-end_ts="2224.285" title="2224.065" id=c_"2224.065">__hi__</span>, of where he's been physiologically. And I think that's scary for certain people to hear about and think about the idea that, you know, an art piece might do those kind of things. Right. So it's pretty incredible. Like to, I, I mean, I imagine these things very aren't that far down the road. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Boy, it's interesting you say that because I've been in a number of conversations lately about how machine learning has, is becoming almost creepily powerful right now. And so, yeah, I, I guess I hadn't thought about it actually infecting my, my art viewership <laugh>. But maybe, maybe I need to start. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Devin: </b>Let's keep an eye on it and see, let's just see how this, plays out and like over the next year, you know, we're gonna keep developing this and you know, we will, we'll, I'll keep you in the, I'll keep you in the loop as <span style="color:red" data-ts="2275.525" data-end_ts="2275.765" title="2275.525" id=c_"2275.525">__what__</span> with, progress and things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That sounds great. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Devin: </b>We're always looking for people who want to, who resonate with what we're doing to reach out to us via the website and contact us. You know, this is a huge, big project with a ton of working parts and we, we, we always are looking for new people. So if you have any interest, by all means, contact us@devonfleener.com. We also do a ton of, you know, most of our, most of our social medias through Instagram. My username is Epic Devon, or you can search for me for Devon's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2307.895" data-end_ts="2308.055" title="2307.895" id=c_"2307.895">__later__</span> on there.

</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. And, I got a chance to see a video that was, that sort of showed, some information. Where was, where's the best place to check that out? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Devin: </b>If you go to devon <span style="color:red" data-ts="2318.965" data-end_ts="2319.645" title="2318.965" id=c_"2318.965">__feller.com__</span>, like right away you're gonna see there's gonna be a co a couple different videos and Got it. It's, it's definitely there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright, awesome. Well, fantastic. So with that then, we'll I'll let you, go on with the rest of your day. Thanks again for your time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Devin: </b>It was an honor. Thank you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Bye. Many thanks to Devin for talking with us about the project. I hope that you get a chance to take a look at it. You can really hear the excitement in his voice when he talks about it. It's obviously something that you really feel strongly about. Thank you so much for listening. Thanks for sharing this with your friends. I'm gonna keep it tight today. We'll catch you next time around. Bye.
