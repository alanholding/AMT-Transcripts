<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. This week we have, a kind of different kind of guest, rather than getting someone who's an expert in the field. I'm actually got somebody who claims to be a beginner. Not really a beginner at all. He's been doing some really interesting max for live devices lately. The one that really caught my attention, his, his max for live text adventure, which I actually highlighted in, I'm highlighting it in an upcoming newsletter for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_%2774">Cycling '74</a> Beyond that, he is, working with Ableton every day, works for Safe by Technologies up in Toronto, and he is, just a pretty fascinating guy. So I hope you enjoy this. Also, I'm just gonna put a plug out there, the Kickstarter, campaign. You can find it by going to kickstarter.com. And just searching for my name, Darwin Gross. It's called, let me look here, what it's called, an Updated Recorder for Art plus Music plus Technology. It's already funded, but any additional funds that we get are gonna help to buy some backup SSD cards, as well as to pay for, future hosting of the podcast. So I want to thank everybody for being in on it. And with that, we're gonna go right to the interview. Here you go. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. This week I'd like to introduce you to somebody that, I'm just getting to know myself, so we're gonna all get to know him a little bit together. His name's Alec Brady and I'm gonna let him kind of fill you in on what he, what he does. I, I ran across him and into him on Facebook. He's sounds like a really interesting guy, and I'm look looking forward to learning more about how he does the thing he does. So, with that, I'll open the door right away. Hi, Alec. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec Brady: </b>I'm great, Darwin How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm great. So thanks a lot for being part of the, the podcast. I appreciate you taking the time to do it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>Yeah, I am a huge fan of the podcast. Been listening to it. You know, I kind of, I think I came to it maybe 50 or 60 episodes in, but, kind of went through the backlog and listened to, you know, as many as I could, and really discovered just a lot of great stuff through it. So thank you from all the, all the fans for, for what you do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, thank you for that. It's been a real labor of love. And I, and it's funny to hear, I mean, it's still funny for me to think of it. You know, you say you came in 50 or 60 episodes and it's hard for me to even believe that I've been doing it for that long. Yeah. But we're getting close to number 100 here, which is <span style="color:red" data-ts="166.485" data-end_ts="166.645" title="166.485" id=c_"166.485">__gonna__</span>, which is pretty wild to me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>Yeah, it's great. Blows me away. It's great. And you know, that you, and, and obviously you can listen to them all online and stuff like that, right. So there's a, a good archive for anybody new who maybe this is their first episode, so 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, indeed. Yeah. So Alec, why don't you, why don't we start off by having you tell us some of the things that you do in your art and music practice? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>Yeah, so I am, I'm fairly new into the, the whole world of, you know, the art, music technology per se. I am 24. I live in, Toronto. And I do a lot of different things. Like I write my own music. I also, I'm, I'm really into, coding, max, max for live devices. And kind of just being part of, a kinda larger scene of, you know, the kinda the maker scene type stuff as well as, you know, creative coding and, and just kind of try my best to, to reach out and, and kind of find my path. I know that a lot of, you know, the other people feature in the show tend to be these kind of like, you know, very groundbreaking people who have, who have done so so much. And I'm very much still trying to discover my path towards that. And I'm kind of, you know, I'm kind of in a situation where I don't know if some decisions I'll make now I'll regret, you know, that kind of thing. I'm, I'm kind of, starting out per <span style="color:red" data-ts="239.125" data-end_ts="239.285" title="239.125" id=c_"239.125">__se__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I think that's really interesting. And it's one of the reasons why I was kind of interested in having you on the podcast, because I think that you actually are similar to many of the people that are listening. But I also think that it's, that you're maybe underplaying things a little bit because I see that you post, you post some really interesting max for live content up on the max for live Facebook. You're involved in like meetups and stuff in the Toronto area, right? Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>Yeah, for sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So you're actually really kind of community active. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>Yeah, for sure. And Toronto especially, you know, is, is such a great community for whether it's modular stuff, whether it's, you know, intermedia, art and it, you know, there's a huge push from the, the community to really get people together and get talking about these things and tons of workshops and stuff like that. So it is, it's definitely one of the best places to be doing this. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What is it about Toronto? Because it seems for just about as long as I've known of known about Toronto as sort of a art place. It has, it has always been really active and really open to a lot of stuff. What, what do you think it is about Toronto that's peculiar in that way? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>I'm not sure. I, I think maybe it's because it's so diverse and like, because of that I'm almost intimidated to, to make a comment 'cause it's like there's just so many people doing so many things that, you know, it's probably a ton of stuff I'm not even aware of is going on. But it always seems like every community kind of has a place here and is doing interesting things and is, is very open. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. So, why don't we, why don't we start off, since you're familiar with the podcast Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you kind of know the drill <laugh>. I do. One of <span style="color:red" data-ts="342.405" data-end_ts="342.445" title="342.405" id=c_"342.405">__the__</span> things I one of the things I like to know is, about people's background. Why don't you fill us in with a little bit of your background Okay. In terms of making, in terms of being both coder and musician and kind of interweaving those things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>Okay. So I think, where I guess I'll start is that, you know, like many people, my parents are both musicians. They're very musical. My, my father taught, guitar, like acoustic guitar at a local high school. I'm, I'm from <span style="color:red" data-ts="373.385" data-end_ts="373.805" title="373.385" id=c_"373.385">__Whippy__</span> Ontario originally, which is kind of a, it's part of the greater Toronto area per se. And, my mother also plays piano. And so, you know, everything was always very musical. So I started playing electric bass in high school, and through there I kind of, proceeded down the, you know, academic music path of studying bass. And then I eventually upgraded to an upright bass and was playing a lot of classical, a lot of jazz. And so I, I was studying under a guy by the name of Neil Davis, who was a, just an amazing teacher for me at that time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>And, he, he really opened me up to a lot of really far out stuff. Like, you know, starting with like, you know, like bitches brew, miles Davis and, and kind of free jazz in general. And kind of opened my mind, per se, you know, and I kind of was at <span style="color:red" data-ts="415.685" data-end_ts="415.925" title="415.685" id=c_"415.685">__like__</span> attuned to this larger world of what was going on with music and like free music. And, and so then I ended up going to York University in Toronto in their jazz program. And I did, upright bass and electric bass. And I, I studied there for about two years, and then I became kind of like, disillusioned with it. I just couldn't find what <span style="color:red" data-ts="433.805" data-end_ts="433.925" title="433.805" id=c_"433.805">__I__</span>, what I was looking for, I guess. Like, it just didn't click with me in the right way, or I was just, I, I just didn't feel like I was as enthusiastic about it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>So I took a year off and, that's when I really found digital music and, you know, synthesizers and, you know, this whole, this whole other world that I was really oblivious to. And it's actually pretty funny, like how I did that was I, I got really sick and for about a month or two I was kind of bedridden and I had a, Nintendo DSS with a game called Corg DSS 10, which was a, it's a, it's a game version of the MS 10 synthesizer with a whole sq 10 sequencer built in and the ability to kind of make patterns and sequence and stuff like that. So I got like totally addicted to that. And I started making all of these songs and, and kind of doing little synthesis experiments. 'cause the DSS is a touchscreen based, system, right? And so you could do some of the patching on the patch panel of the MS 10 with the touchscreen. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>And I was just like, it was a whole new world for me. And so really quickly I realized that the compositions and things I was doing, you know, these kind of little songs that were coming out of this, I found so much more kind of authorship in. And I just felt like, okay, this is what I need to do. Like, I found like, this is it, you know, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="507.805" data-end_ts="507.925" title="507.805" id=c_"507.805">__it__</span>, you really kind of feel it, I guess. Like, I, I, you know, I really knew that that's what I wanted to do. So very shortly after I sold the upright base and I invested in a number of different music equipment, and I <span style="color:red" data-ts="517.845" data-end_ts="518.045" title="517.845" id=c_"517.845">__kinda__</span> switched programs at, at York u and, and moved into more the, the digital music basement. They have, there's sort of this little cave in the basement with, some, some Mac computers running. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>They, they were running reason five at the time, so I was, I was really into reason and right. You know, so then got into hardware and then, you know, know, graduated a couple years ago from York U and now I'm kind of doing my thing, whether it's with Max or, you know, definitely Ableton Live played a huge part in, in it as well. I kind of, it took me a while to kind of find the DAW that I felt the most comfortable in, and I eventually did find that in Ableton. So that's primarily what I'm using now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So what is it about Ableton that spoke to you specifically? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>And you know, what's funny is that Ableton is such a kind of multi-use. Like, there's so many different workflows. It's like any anybody I meet has a different way of approaching it. That's true. So for me, like I'm, I'm very much into range view, surprisingly. I know a lot of people prefer session, which is the kind of, you know, block and clip based view. So I'm more into the very standard linear one. But for me, what did it was Max for live, like just my instructor at UUA guy by the name of Ed Wilson, who <span style="color:red" data-ts="585.965" data-end_ts="586.125" title="585.965" id=c_"585.965">__is__</span>, you know, incredibly influential to me, kind of told me when he first explained Max for Live, to me, it's, he's like, okay, so, so that's Ableton. He'd given me a demo and said, okay, so imagine opening up the hood and having access to every single way that the, that it ticks and being able to do whatever you want. I was like, well, why would I use anything else? You know, this is, this is what I, this is what I need to be doing, you know? Right. So, yeah. That, that was great. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. Yeah. So you say that you're, you're more focused on the <span style="color:red" data-ts="613.605" data-end_ts="614.045" title="613.605" id=c_"613.605">__arrange__</span> view. Yeah. Which to me then says you're actually using the software as if it was a different version of logic or something like that. Right? Because isn't that, wouldn't that be the way that you would interact with it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>It's weird because like, honestly, every time I kind of sit down with live, I try and use it a different way. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But for the most part, I'm recording two <span style="color:red" data-ts="635.525" data-end_ts="635.925" title="635.525" id=c_"635.525">__arrange__</span> views. So, like, for example <span style="color:red" data-ts="637.305" data-end_ts="637.525" title="637.305" id=c_"637.305">__Oh__</span>, I see. Right. You know, you can do like, generate midi. Like, I, like one of the things I kind of use in my arsenal quite a bit is using the follow actions in, the clip views in session mode to kind of make these, almost algorithmic, like, swapping of clips, these kind of, you know, oh, right. And then taking that midi recording that into a range, and then kind of going from there, type thing. So, but, but a range is where I spend most of my time. 'cause I, I really like going, you know, very meticulously deep into audio, for example, like, you know, working on a very micro scale type thing. And, and, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="668.205" data-end_ts="668.325" title="668.205" id=c_"668.205">__just__</span>, I just love range mode for the speed. You can, you can do it in with that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and it's interesting that you talk about it in terms of a generative system. One of the things that I, so I teach, I teach Ableton live in one of the classes that I do at a local university. Yeah. And one of the things that I try to impress on people, and they seem a little nonplus by it, but I am, I am fascinated by it, is the fact that there are a lot of, there are a lot of ways to do unconventional things with <span style="color:red" data-ts="697.605" data-end_ts="697.845" title="697.605" id=c_"697.605">__lives__</span>. So you talk about the use of the follow the follow actions, which is a great way to cause things to sort of generatively run through a process or randomize a process. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. There's the, the thing of like the unconnected, clip envelopes. Yeah, yeah. Which is another way to just cause generations <span style="color:red" data-ts="719.425" data-end_ts="719.645" title="719.425" id=c_"719.425">__in__</span> really unique ways. And I think it's interesting to think of live as sort of a development environment on, on its own, similar to something like Max, where you have the ability to kind of push the, push some musical envelopes with it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>Yeah, absolutely. And that, that's what I really appreciate with it, is that it has the flexibility to really, you know, accommodate all these different things. Whether it's someone who, for example, let's say they're, they just want to play a playlist in session mode at a party. They have like, you know, a top 40 set list and they drop it in and they want to have dynamic quantized, you know, launching of the different songs and stuff, or someone who, who wants to, you know, go further with Max. It's like just this, it's this umbrella for all these different, you know, ideas and, and ways of working. And I, I really, really like it for that for sure. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So some of the things that you've done recently were pretty complex, max for <span style="color:red" data-ts="770.525" data-end_ts="770.725" title="770.525" id=c_"770.525">__live__</span> devices, and pardon me for not knowing this, but, so I'm gonna ask you about it. Yeah. Some of 'em seem to come out under the <span style="color:red" data-ts="779.095" data-end_ts="779.445" title="779.095" id=c_"779.095">__Saved__</span> By Technology moniker. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>Yeah. So I guess I should kind of intro that. So, saved By Technology is a, which, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Given the name of my podcast, you can imagine that I just came in love with that name, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b><laugh>? Yeah. So, so Saved By Technology is a company, that was founded, almost 30 years ago now, in Toronto, by a guy by the name of Jim Burgess, who's a synthesizer, like, kind of pioneer, in, in Toronto for sure, as far as, you know, bringing MIDI to Canada, one of the first people to import the PPG system to Canada. So he, he kind of like was able to found connections with a lot of the artists here and set up this base in downtown Toronto called Saved by Technology, where we sell Apple computers and, larger pro tools, HD systems. And it's kind of just a hub for studios to come and get what they need, whether it's like, you know, a, a computer loaded with, pro tools and a synth, et cetera, et cetera. And we kind of, and I, I, I'm employed there, I work there, kind of as their Ableton guy. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>I see. And so we'll kind of set people's computers up, get them started, and then it's kind of like doing tech support, you know, whatever people need. Right. So what we've kind of branched into doing is creating Custom Max for live devices as like a free download once a month. Right. We kind of make a max for live device, or maybe sometimes a standalone max device and things like that. So, yeah. So I've, I've had the opportunity through them to be able to release a lot of this stuff kind of on a bigger scale and, you know, kind of have their support in, in developing and stuff like that. So that, that's been a total blast. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So saved by technology tends to work with kind of studios and, and those kind of environments. How do you see Ableton Live impacting those places? Because generally we think of, you know, a studio's gonna use Pro Tools and, and you know, if you take like the mental image, and I know it's not correct. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But what I'd say is people think of the, the studio being the place to use pro tools. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, a bedroom at your mom's house is where you Ableton live, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b><laugh>. Yeah. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But I'm starting to see it crop up in virtually every professional environment. What are you seeing in terms of being around an environment where there's a lot of studios, but you being the able to live guy? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>Well, it's interesting because I really have the opportunity to interact with this really diverse crowd of like, you know, like that those demographics, whether it's the guy in the, the top end studio with Pro Tools, HDX system, or the person who's, you know, using a CUBASE trial to just kind of like arrange some stuff for school or something like that. Right. So what I've really seen is a kind of, you know, meshing of all of them where somebody will have, yeah, let's track the band <span style="color:red" data-ts="938.605" data-end_ts="938.765" title="938.605" id=c_"938.605">__and__</span> Pro Tools, but then when we go and do some effects editing and stuff, let's drop it into live and then bounce it back. Like, it's kind of like, you know, at the end of the day, pro Tools still is, for the most part, the kind of industry standard for professional, you know, like whether it's broadcast and stuff like that. But Ableton is very quickly becoming the kind of Swiss Army knife for processing audio or doing interesting things with midi and loops and stuff like that. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So it's, and you know, me personally, like I use it every step of the way, whether it's, you know, the post-production stuff or the sketching out an idea, you know, but, but even the people who are kind of pro tools, you know, who are, are set in their pro tools ways, are also using Ableton Live, which is great. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That's, that is cool. Well, and I can see how in certain kinds of, scenarios it does end up being that Swiss Army knife kind of thing. Do you, do you ha do you still feel like, and I say still because I think I, I mean, this is, again, the way I think of it, people tend to think of Pro Tools as being sort of a tape recorder replacement type tool. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> where Ableton Live is like where the creatives, you know, which is sort of like the kooky people <laugh>, right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>Of 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Course. Yeah. Where the creatives work, do you see those boundaries getting mashed up? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>I do. Yeah. And I mean, and, and one of the reasons is because, you know, as we were talking about before, like just the kind of depth of workflow type in Ableton is that, you know, if you're someone new coming to live and you're watching, let's say YouTube tutorials, like you can very easily find those same dry kind of, you know, very technical audio engineering type tutorial videos for Live as you would with Pro Tools. You know, like it can kind of cover all of that. And then at the same time, find some, you know, really crazy way of, you know, routing MIDI through something else, or <span style="color:red" data-ts="1052.725" data-end_ts="1052.925" title="1052.725" id=c_"1052.725">__do__</span> using a combination of audio effects in rack. So yeah. It's, it's very much <span style="color:red" data-ts="1057.525" data-end_ts="1057.645" title="1057.525" id=c_"1057.525">__a__</span>, the lines are kind of blurring as far as, you know, different daws being these kind of standalone, you know, systems. It's kind of like, you know, at a certain point you're kind of expected to know a little bit about all of them, you know? Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, let's talk a little bit more about you and your personal journey. Now, it sounds to me from your background, like you're, the primary part of your journey was, was musical, and you kind of came to the technology part of it later for people who talk about their past in that way. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I'm curious, how did you first break into coding? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>Well, that, that, yeah. That's interesting. And, and a good question because, you know, I took computer science in, in high school, and I, I did really bad, actually. I think I got like a, like AC or something. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I think, you know, like anything that's, you know, technical but at the same time allows for, you know, creativity is that it really depends on who your teacher is and kind of who shows you that side of it that reveals, you know, what interests you. And for a lot of people, you know, who are into technology and specifically like computer science, it, it comes naturally. It's like, oh yeah, no, I totally, you know, enjoy this and like this. But for me, it took a long time. Like it took till after, you know, kind of the, the final stages of my, my undergraduate work of, of being like, oh, wait a minute. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>You know, like, everything is, is cool. You know what I mean? Like, looking at printer drivers or, or reading about cryptography. Like, all these things began to interest me in a way that they didn't before, when it was kind of formalized. Right. So I kind of discovered it kind of by myself just reading about synthesizers and then reading more and more about computers and, and how code works and kind of ways you can write scripts. You know, starting with, you know, the, the scripts that are included with Ableton, like for, you know, midi midi mappings and things like that. Oh, right. Yeah. And, and kind of like understanding the, the underpinnings of a lot of the software isn't too, too crazy. It's kind of like, no, like they all have these solid foundations in, in this kind of code, and this is how this works. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>So I've kind of been going from there and kind of learning as I go, like as I've needed something kind of, you know, spent, you know, nights staying up all night and reading about that and learning about that, and kind of jumping back and forth. So it's been interesting for sure. And I've kind of ended up in really weird places. Like just recently, I, I, I actually bought, or I got given to me an Atari st computer, which I'm having a total blast with as like a midi source. Sure. And so I've just been going through that and, and, you know, learning a lot about its kind of history and, I've got notator on it right now, and, you know, kind of <laugh>, you know, so I'm just kind of learning in, in all kinds of different places, as you know, and as, as you kind of do with the web Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1218.285" data-end_ts="1218.525" title="1218.285" id=c_"1218.285">__That__</span> it's really difficult to find one solid from point A to point B source for learning something. Right. So, I've kind of just been all over the place. It kind of started with synthesizers and then branched out from there, I'd say. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see. So what was like your first programming environment? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>It was called Blitz Basic. And it was this, like, it was a version of basic, actually, it was <span style="color:red" data-ts="1240.045" data-end_ts="1240.165" title="1240.045" id=c_"1240.045">__like__</span>, my mom bought me a book and it was called, it was called Game Programming for Teens. Right. And I, I was just like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1246.385" data-end_ts="1246.605" title="1246.385" id=c_"1246.385">__oh__</span>, you know, this is so lame, mom, <laugh>, I don't this like, you know, I wanna be, you know, I, I don't care about this. 'cause I, you know, I'm really into video games myself, but I remember, like, I sat down and I learned a bunch of it, and it's only now that a lot of the concepts that I'd learned in, in Blitz Basic have kind of come back to me, you know, like, you know, when I've kind of got more into seriously coding and, you know, so that's kind of where I started. I, and it's, it's kind of a version of basic, essentially, like, it's, it's a simplified version of basic. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, and my assumption is it was like a text version of basic. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>Yeah, exactly. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So how hard was it for you to make the jump into a visual programming thing like Max? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>I found it to be a lot easier. Like, I found it just to be exactly what I needed. Like, I kind of clicked with it right away, going through some of the early tutorials and, and kind of reverse engineering, a number of people's patches and looking at, you know, how the logic works and, and the, the data flow and just kind of the general, you know, the, the general shape of a max <span style="color:red" data-ts="1309.325" data-end_ts="1309.605" title="1309.325" id=c_"1309.325">__patch__</span>. Like, what does it look like? Where are things going? And just being like, yeah, no, I, this, this really gels with me. This is what I want to do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's curious, because I think a lot of people have different kinds of feelings when they encounter visual programming. Yeah. I mean, some people think of it not even as programming, but like the equivalent of hooking up guitar pedals or whatever. But yeah, for sure. It sounds to me like you're, you're approaching it from kind of a, kind of a, an experienced programmer's view, whether you feel like you were experienced or not. It's that kind of, that kind of perspective, data flow and data structures and stuff like that is sort of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1349.335" data-end_ts="1349.455" title="1349.335" id=c_"1349.335">__a__</span>, a programmer's approach to it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>Yeah. And like I really, I, I definitely wouldn't consider myself an expert programmer, but I, you know, I, I, I, I kind of looked at it like that at first, and I think that's what helped me jump the gap of, of a lot of the things that people run into, you know, when, when they first see max of that, hey, yeah, this looks kind of just like a, you know, you know, something like maybe, the Nord Modular or, or something that's kind of a higher level type thing, where a lot of the time, you know, when you're using Max, you're actually kind of dealing with the kind of layer below that, you know, like a, a little bit of a lower level, you know, and, and just how visual it is, you know, even with, let's say like Gates or something I find just so interesting to, it's kind of like, building a big machine and then just watching it work. Like just going into patching mode and looking at the thing and being like, yeah, like I made this, you know, <laugh>. So there, there's a satisfaction in that it feels a little more tangible, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. In your work, it, you know, it sounds like you're very comfortable with Ableton and Max Live and stuff. Do you use, do you use hardware at all? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>I do, yeah. When I sold my upright base, I, I kind of pooled money together and, you know, got the, the, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1420.965" data-end_ts="1421.255" title="1420.965" id=c_"1420.965">__ammo__</span> voyager. So that's kind of at the center of, of everything. And then I've kind of built around that. So I have a, a small three U euro rack set up, that is very, heavily focused on, you know, outboard computing with the, you know, the hardcore or the, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1436.405" data-end_ts="1436.565" title="1436.405" id=c_"1436.405">__and__</span> the teletype and, you know, things like that. Oh, interesting. Little scripts. And so I'll run that with, my output of Ableton. I have the, the Make <span style="color:red" data-ts="1445.765" data-end_ts="1445.965" title="1445.765" id=c_"1445.765">__Noise__</span> Phono <span style="color:red" data-ts="1446.445" data-end_ts="1446.605" title="1446.445" id=c_"1446.445">__gene__</span>, which I also use as kind of the, the centerpiece. So it's all kind of connected together. Like everything's a very bizarre hardware setup right now. Like it's, you know, a lot of synths and, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1457.645" data-end_ts="1457.805" title="1457.645" id=c_"1457.645">__Euro__</span> React stuff as well as, you know, that the Atari St I mentioned before has, right. Has kind of been integrated, you know, kind of sucked into the greater setup here. So, yeah. So, so yeah, hardware is definitely a big part. I find that a lot of the kind of foundation for the sound I work with comes from, analog hardware, but I am, you know, very much into plugins as well, like using, you know, digital sources I, I find are, are amazing as well. So. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So a couple of questions. You just opened a big door right there, which is interesting, <laugh>. First of all, how do you feel about the Voyager being discontinued? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>That's a good point. That's, that's fresh. Very, very, you know, that was yesterday, the day before. Yeah. Yeah. But, yeah, I mean, like, it, it's, it's the marking of a new era, I think. I think that, the focus has shift, obviously today is the day that they announced the, the mother 32. Right. Semi modular, which kind of shows, you know, where they, where they've set their vision with the, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1514.725" data-end_ts="1514.845" title="1514.725" id=c_"1514.725">__R__</span> rack stuff, which is, is really exciting, I have to say. And I think, you know, Voyagers will be around in the secondhand market for a very long time. You know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I just happen to know a lot of people who, like, you feel like the Voyager is their center of their kind of music making device setup, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>Yeah. Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1535.505" data-end_ts="1535.725" title="1535.505" id=c_"1535.505">__And__</span> it, I think it's, it's because it accommodates so many different ways of working, whether it's, you know, with the, the touchscreen or it's, it's, it's just such a flexible instrument. It really is, just an amazing, you know, machine. And, you know, there are alternatives in, in their own product line and stuff like that. And of course, the original MiniMogue and things like that. But there's something about it that just lends itself to kind of just sitting down with it and just pumping out really fun stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Now, you talk about having a little eurorack system, but when you, when you identify it by, or when the two identifying features are the hardcore and the, teletype Mm-Hmm. I, I have this, all of a sudden I have this imagination of a studio that looks like a mad scientist's office, maybe combined with a dentist's office in some way or something else, something really bizarre, because those are two, well, it, it seems like there's a pattern here. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, one of the reasons you like Ableton Live is because there's this programmability tool available to it, the hardcore, which that's my baby. Yeah. The hardcore is, you know, a platform for programming inside your modular Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So is the, so is the teletype, but in a different way. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And then you've got the Atari St. Which is a, an event generator system. Exactly. I mean, is, is this kind of flexibility. Well, and even as you talk about the Voyager, you're talking about sort of like the hyper flexibility <span style="color:red" data-ts="1633.185" data-end_ts="1633.405" title="1633.185" id=c_"1633.185">__as__</span> being important to you. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, it seems like flexibility and sort of programmability is really important to you. Why, why is that? What, what is it that draws you to that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>I think it's just, you know, accessibility. Like, you know, of course with the hardcore and, and teletype, what I was really looking for was that idea of, you know, what do I want my modular to be today? Like, you know, I'm sitting down, I have an idea, you know, I, you know, I could get a clock divider, I could get, you know, all these different things, or I could just, you know, have some sketches ready for the hardcore that I can easily just flash in and then kind of get started, you know? I built my, my URAC system with limitations. Like, I really kind of took into account where I'm gonna stop, you know? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I said, no, I don't wanna have any, no oscillators, you know, no envelopes. I just want this to be a dedicated little computer and signal processor. So, you know, with the Phono <span style="color:red" data-ts="1690.525" data-end_ts="1690.685" title="1690.525" id=c_"1690.525">__gene__</span>, which is a sort of looper, you know, tape-based looper kind of thing. I'm using that as the, the center of it, which then everything gets run through, and then kind of how it's being run through is determined by the, the teletype or the, the corp, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That seems like a fascinating combo because the, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1710.605" data-end_ts="1710.845" title="1710.605" id=c_"1710.605">__phone__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1710.955" data-end_ts="1711.245" title="1710.955" id=c_"1710.955">__gene__</span> on its own is pretty wacky. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah. But then being able to drive it using some of the programmatic options available in hardcore or the, or the teletype. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> strikes me as like Uber wacky <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>Yeah. And, you know, the teletype I, I got last week, so it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1729.885" data-end_ts="1729.965" title="1729.885" id=c_"1729.885">__a__</span> very new, and I've kind of just set it up and, you know, I'm a, I'm a huge fan of, of the mono stuff. I think that, you know, the stuff Brian's doing is just amazing. And, you know, I'm <span style="color:red" data-ts="1739.245" data-end_ts="1739.365" title="1739.245" id=c_"1739.245">__a__</span> member of the forum there, and I kind of just today looked over some of the code examples for the teletype and was just like, this, this is so cool. Like, I'm, you know, this is amazing. So I'm, I'm very new to it, but, it, it seems like it's the module for me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So, as a, a young person, and as someone who still kind of considers themselves new in the environment, I'm curious, what do you find the easiest or the best way to learn stuff? You know, we talk about the teletype. The Teletype has got a video series that can help you learn it. It's got some textual documentation, it's got the forums where people answer, ask, and answer questions. What have those things helped you get on top of the teletype since it's so new? I'm thinking you're gonna really have a grasp on what's helping you learn it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>Honestly, with, with anything, for me, the way, the way I learn, and, you know, for everybody, it's different. But I find that I have to give myself a project. Like I have to say, here's something I want to do. How do I get there? And along the way, you'll pick up some of the really basic stuff that, you know, otherwise you wouldn't want to learn, per se. You know, like, with the Teletype, what my kind of goal right now is I saw that somebody had posted up some code for, you know, clapping music. Right? Like, how to do the clapping music phasing with, with gait outputs from the teletype. And, when I was studying at York UI had the opportunity to study with, a guy by the name of Matt Brubeck, and he was my new music ensemble, teacher. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>And, he, he actually had the, <laugh> the kind of, the honor of, of being there for when I switched from bass to synth <laugh>. So I showed up. So first two years I was playing upright bass, and he's like, you know, this is great. We always need an upright bass player for the new music ensemble. Then I disappear for a year, and I came back with a synthesizer, and I'm like, this is what I play. Like, you know, I mean, he, he's like, okay, you know, yeah, you come in and we'll play. But he had written this, this piece called, four Degrees of Separation, and it's a tone row in fourths set to Steve Reich's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1862.245" data-end_ts="1862.365" title="1862.245" id=c_"1862.245">__clap__</span> music. So it kind of, it phases and then sometimes it's in, you know, rhythmic unison with, you know, nice, you know, fourth harmony, and then it comes back into full unison. So right now I'm trying to program that for the teletype, you know, out to a couple oscillators and actually perform his piece using just the, the, the, you know, the external synth gear and have it kind of play itself. And then, you know, that that's kind of a project of mine. And, you know, through that I'm gonna have to end up learning, you know, a lot of stuff. And, you know, kind of, that's my goal of getting there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Yeah. You kind of hinted at the front end and you hinted to this, about this to me, when we first started talking about you doing the podcast. What, what do you think the future looks like for you? You seem to be a little unsure of it, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1912.385" data-end_ts="1912.605" title="1912.385" id=c_"1912.385">__or__</span>, or <span style="color:red" data-ts="1912.845" data-end_ts="1913.085" title="1912.845" id=c_"1912.845">__make__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1913.085" data-end_ts="1913.125" title="1913.085" id=c_"1913.085">__you__</span> nervous 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>Maybe's, that's exactly it. I mean, like, I have, I, you know, that it, it's a really good question. I, I have no idea, but I'm just, I'm, I'm keeping everything open and I'm very excited about everything that I do. So I'm kind of just, you know, looking around and trying my hand at different things. I had the, incredible, opportunity just recently to do some Ableton work with, with Seal. And, and Jim Burgess had saved by technology, for his Rock and Rio, performance, like just two weeks ago. You know, just stuff like that. Like, just being able to get in there and, and do a lot of like, really, like, enable a lot of Ableton work. I would've never done preparing. You know, some of the, the backing tracks and, you know, editing some new stems from an album and all this kind of stuff, stuff. So I'm really open to everything. And I just recently, completed a bit of an experiment of doing a, a text-based adventure for Max for Live. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I saw that. That looked hilarious. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>It's got <span style="color:red" data-ts="1969.805" data-end_ts="1969.845" title="1969.805" id=c_"1969.805">__a__</span> brilliant <span style="color:red" data-ts="1970.245" data-end_ts="1970.525" title="1970.245" id=c_"1970.245">__mini__</span> soundtrack as well, <laugh>. So like when you boot it up, you can turn MIDI on and you drop an instrument and it'll play based on, you know, what room you're in, the musical <span style="color:red" data-ts="1979.465" data-end_ts="1979.885" title="1979.465" id=c_"1979.465">__little__</span> bit and stuff. So <laugh>, you know, I'm kind of just doing as much as I can, you know, just to, and, and kind of have fun while doing it. Like I'm, you know, I don't, I don't consider myself or take myself too, too seriously. I just kind of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1990.605" data-end_ts="1990.805" title="1990.605" id=c_"1990.605">__wanna__</span> have fun and, and learn primarily, you know, and, and help and help others learn, you know, through workshops and things like that, or whatever I can do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Are you a Ableton certified trainer? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>I'm not, no. Really. But I believe that I am working towards that, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Because it seems like a lot of what you're talking about, you know, I've talked to other certified trainers is as part of this, and, and it seems like they often will have these kinds of experiences, you know, both professionally, like working with somebody in preparation for a tour. Yeah. But also coming up with a completely inexplicably fun idea. I think there's something about, you know, really hyper embedding yourself into something like Able Live Yeah. That leads you to say, well, it doesn't even make sense to have it be the platform, but for this thing, but that's my platform and I'm gonna give it a flyer. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>Yeah, exactly. And it's just like, you know what, what it was is I heard about this, I heard about this kind of breakthrough in audio audiobooks of having embedded music in eBooks or Yeah. For, for, you know, Kindles and Cobos and stuff. Oh, sure. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2058.085" data-end_ts="2058.165" title="2058.085" id=c_"2058.085">__Yeah__</span>. Of like, the idea of having a soundtrack go along with the ebook where, you know, the writer can essentially draw from this kind of database of songs and then, you know, say, okay, from pages 20 to 40, you're gonna play this. And then I was like, oh, that's a really cool idea. Like, how could I do that in Ableton Live? And I was thinking like, you know, and eventually that's how I got the idea of a text-based adventure was like, you know, I wonder if this could work. You know? And I, I had, you know, again, like in, in learning, I, I had the goal and then I kind of set limitations. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>I said like, I only want to use the dialogue box. Like, I don't want to use <laugh>. I don't want to make a custom. You know, I could easily do like a, you know, an embedded patcher that kind of opens up and Right. You know, and I was like, no, I want it to be as minimal as possible. Right. And then I also, I also challenged myself not to use the word the at all in the whole thing. Oh my goodness. Yeah. So, so it just weird stuff. And then the way it turned out, just it has this kind of vibe to it. I'm like, yeah, you know, that's good. Like, I, I like that. So, yeah. You know, setting limitations and just kind of having a, a goal. And it ended up pretty well, I think. So I, chapter one is up there now. I'm gonna make more eventually. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Well, it's, that's really fascinating. That's a lot of fun. So, you mentioned that, <laugh> in your new music ensemble program, you sort of like, were in the, or in working with this guy that you were kind of, he caught you in the middle of your, your transition from He did, yeah. Bass to the synthesis, but for some reason I am finding an awful lot of people that are into electronic music have some, if not a lot of experience working with bass. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, what do you think it is about the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2155.605" data-end_ts="2155.845" title="2155.605" id=c_"2155.605">__base__</span> and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2156.205" data-end_ts="2156.325" title="2156.205" id=c_"2156.205">__a__</span>, as an instrument, or maybe the base as a starting point or whatever. What, what is it about the base that leads people eventually into electronics and not using the base anymore? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>So that's, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Or, or using it in adjunct to the base, maybe, but, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>Yeah. And you know, that's a, that's a good question. 'cause I wasn't, I wasn't your kind of typical bass player. I think that by the time I had, you know, kind of said, you know, I don't know if this is for me, I was mostly like playing it on its side with like two bows and a bunch of effects <laugh>. Like, it was, it was not, you know, your your typical walking bass <span style="color:red" data-ts="2191.085" data-end_ts="2191.285" title="2191.085" id=c_"2191.085">__line__</span> type thing. But I certainly had, you know, moments, moments in that, you know, traditional, sense of playing the bass. And, you know, it's, it's hard to say, but a lot of what I first connected with, with, sequencing on this corg, application for, for the, the DSS was that, you know, it's kind of thinking and blocks. Like when, when I was playing bass, a lot of it were these, you know, repeating patterns. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>Like often in classical music, the bass is, is, is sort of repeating these figures. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> or it's creating variations on these, you know, figures. And, you know, traditionally the, the bass is a monophonic instrument. Like, you're not so much playing chords that much given its range. Like, you know, when it's being arranged in, in, you know, western classical music, you're mostly playing, you know, bubu bump over and over again. Right. And kind of doing variations on that. So like, I found that when I'm kind of writing for, you know, these synthesizers in this monoclonic sequencer, it was like, oh yeah, okay. So I, I can kind of see how this, you know, this little pattern would connect to this pattern. You know, thinking about, let's say clip view in live is like, okay, you know, I have this shape, and then if I kind of make this little change to it here, it kind of inverts. And, you know, there's kind of progression to it. So I, I just think it has to do with the role of the base in the larger, you know, musical picture as this, like, you know, it kind of sits in the background a lot of the time and it's, you know, kind of just outlining the chord shapes or, you know, it, it's, it's very rare to have it upfront playing, you know, these melodies. It's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2280.485" data-end_ts="2280.525" title="2280.485" id=c_"2280.485">__kind__</span> of always in the background, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I, it's funny you say that. I'd never really thought about it that way, but, you know, really, so much of what we think of as like analog se, analog based sequencing or whatever, all that stuff is just variations of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2297.805" data-end_ts="2298.085" title="2297.805" id=c_"2297.805">__Austin__</span> auto baselines that were developed in the 15 hundreds. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>Exactly. Right. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And so, that I never really thought about it that way, but it does kind of set the place nicely for, or set the plate nicely for you to be able to do that kind of stuff. Really interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>Yeah. And, and you know, especially when you're, when you're kind of very, for me at least, like when I first got into sense, I was all about bass. Like, 'cause that was a range that I understood how to write for sure. I kind of got where it fit tonally and, you know, I'm still not the best at writing melodies, like, you know, people who play more, instruments like guitars, you know, maybe they're, they're easier for, but for me it was all about like sitting down with a saw wave and just carving it into something, you know, super snappy and funky and, you know, it was, it was basically like having, you know, a analog electronic <span style="color:red" data-ts="2348.445" data-end_ts="2348.725" title="2348.445" id=c_"2348.445">__base__</span> kind of thing. You know, I kind of approached it a lot of the same way. So, and, and I kind of still do, you know, when I'm sitting down with a synth, like I'll oftentimes start with the baseline, so, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So when you're actually putting together a whole, a whole production, a whole soundtrack or whatever Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, what do you find the most difficult to do? Is it the melodies or is it the percussion, or where, where do you find the hard stuff for you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>So I have like, such a bizarre approach to making, like, any kind of music. Like I, what I find hardest is to stop, like when to kind of call it quits in the process type thing. Right, right. But I find it's definitely melody. It's like, okay, well this is great <span style="color:red" data-ts="2387.625" data-end_ts="2387.845" title="2387.625" id=c_"2387.625">__now__</span>, but like, you know, who's really gonna care unless it has that kind of hook to it type thing. And you know, that's obviously what you're gonna spend a lot of your, your time on working on is the kind of, you know, that one lick or that one theme that's really gonna stick in people's heads afterwards. But I, like, honestly, when I, when I sit down to make music, I try and do it different every time. Like, I try and avoid the same process. Like, I always kind of do something like, okay, this time I'm only gonna use this synth, or I'm only gonna use this one midi sequence, and I'll have to like invert it and transpose it and to, to make it weird and stuff like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>So, yeah, I, I don't know, like my, my relationship with Ableson live as far as actually composing is, is pretty bizarre in that respect. And, you know, a lot of people have kind of questioned my ways when I'm <laugh> talking to them about live, you know, people who are very much like Singer-songwriters and stuff. And they'll, they'll ask me, oh, you know, how do you do this? I'm like, oh, you don't want to hear my answer. It's, it's like, you don't want to do it, like, it works for me. But, you know, one thing I do is I never keep any of my project files when I'm done with them uhhuh <affirmative>. Like when I'm done something 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You want sealed in stone. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>Yeah. And when I have that wave file, like I don't want to go back. Right. So I just delete it and then it's like, you know, it's this very, you kind of feel a weight lifted, like, alright, now I have it in stone, that's it. If maybe I can make it better, but you know what, I'll just do it next time. You know what I mean? Sure. Like, you know, I've just gotta up myself that the next time I work on something. But some people are like shocked by that. They'll ask me like, oh, you know, what kind of backup do you use? I'm like, I don't need much backup. It's like, what do you mean? Like, well, you know, I've just got wave files. So it's, it's, it's a weird way to work, but, you know, and again, it's just the program is so flexible to be able to accommodate all of these different, you know, bizarre ways of working with it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. So as a, as someone who feels like they're still kind of like developing themselves, who do you look to as being sort of the, the people that are informing you the direction you want to take things, who are sort of, you know, I don't wanna call 'em influences or Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> heroes or anything <span style="color:red" data-ts="2508.225" data-end_ts="2508.445" title="2508.225" id=c_"2508.225">__in__</span>, you know, with that kind of moniker. I'm just wondering who is it you look to as kind of like, leading, leading you down the right path? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>Like right now, I really think that it's everyone like online, you know, like these, the community. Yeah. Yeah. Whether it's Muff Wiggler or, you know, the, the mono forums. It's just looking at what everybody else is doing and just being able to see like, wow, you know, people are so much better than I am at this. Like, I should really kick into gear and, you know, start trying to, to up my game here. You know, so it's, you know, there, there's obviously individuals who, who, are mentors to me who I look up to, you know, people who I've, you know, studied under previously or who, who I work with now, who, you know, obviously influenced me a great deal in what I do and, you know, helped me to kind of strive to what I wanna be. But it, it's really just looking at the bigger picture at what people are doing and you know, how they're doing it and how many people are doing it. That's really my, my kind of driving force right now. And it's, it's, it's such a great time to be doing these kind of things because there's just so much going on so often that, you know, you can't, I can't open up my, Facebook stream without something from create digital music that just makes me go like, damn, I wish I thought of that. You know? Right. So it's like, no, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I, I wanna pig you on something though. 'cause you say, well, everybody's so much, so much better or so much more efficient than you or whatever. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But you do a lot of stuff <span style="color:red" data-ts="2594.265" data-end_ts="2594.485" title="2594.265" id=c_"2594.265">__and__</span> I mean, in terms of someone putting stuff out there that's like completed work. Yeah. I think you're one of the more efficient people that I see out there. <laugh>, what, what is it that makes you think that other people are better than you? <laugh>? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>That's a good question. I, I, I don't know. I, I think that I'm, I'm very, kind of competitive with myself, <laugh>, you know? Okay. And that I'm always kind of like, you know, I don't, I don't, the, the work that I do, I kind of, I don't think it's, you know, great, but I don't think it's bad. Like, I kind of hold it in some, you know, part of myself as saying, you know, it's, it's great you did that, but you know, time for the next thing, time to go that one step above what I did last time. So, you know, and it's, it's, it's so hard on, on when you're going through the web because it's like the, the scale of of skill between people is like literally people who have never started and then the ultimate masters. Like, you know, the 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Person who made all <span style="color:red" data-ts="2655.085" data-end_ts="2655.205" title="2655.085" id=c_"2655.085">__the__</span> stuff that 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>You're, yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2656.085" data-end_ts="2656.125" title="2656.085" id=c_"2656.085">__The__</span> Wizards are, you know, and it's like, because digital music technology is so, it's such a young art form in a young medium. A lot of them are, are here and they're active, and it's just like, oh man. Like, I'm rubbing shoulders with some people who are like, you know, these incredibly talented people. Right. So it, it, you know, it, it really pushes me to, to, to always go farther, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. So, a lot of times in my podcast I like, I like kind of, posing the question of, you know, what would you say to a 20 year old version of yourself <laugh>? Well, you're too close to 20 to pull that off, right? Yeah. So instead, I'm gonna kind of flip it because you're, you're a little less than half my age. What, what do you want to have accomplished, or where do you want to be when you're my age? Where do you want <span style="color:red" data-ts="2707.765" data-end_ts="2707.925" title="2707.765" id=c_"2707.765">__to__</span> be when you're in your fifties? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>You know, I was, I was thinking about this, you know, coming, coming home today to, to get ready for this, interview. I was kinda thinking like, you know what, what, what do I think Darwin's gonna throw at me? Like, you know, I'll, I'll think of this one. You know, and, and this is one I did think about, and, you know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2725.365" data-end_ts="2725.485" title="2725.365" id=c_"2725.365">__I__</span>, you know, with, with everything I've done in music, whether it's writing and or, you know, writing music or playing music live or doing these things, I've never had more satisfaction than making a device that someone's used and said, Hey, you know, I really like using this. This really helps me. There's just something, there's some kind of satisfaction that I get in that, that's so much greater than, than writing a piece of music, just building a utility for someone. So what I really, you know, my kind of dream and my passion is to create something that someone will want to use and like using, you know, like whether it's software or, you know, a piece of hardware or I just, I'm, I'm, I would really like to help someone do what they want to do by using, you know, what I can do to, to help them achieve that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>You know, that that's really kind of, I know it's pretty vague, but that's, that's the best way I can put it, is, you know, and, you know, and, I, I mentioned to you before we, we did this, I said, you know, I'm at that stage where I, I know that a lot of the things I say now and do now, I'll probably regret. And I'll, I'll probably have to wipe some, you know, some songs outta my repertoire later. You know, kind of go back with the, the marker. But that's really what I wanna do. And I don't know what shape or form it'll take, but I just really want to, you know, help people make the art they wanna make 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Well, I'll tell you just from looking at the, at the work that you've been doing and, and providing to the community and stuff, I think that you definitely are on a, on a good path for that. Thank you. I want to thank you, Alex, for spending the time going, kind of like rambling all over the place. It was fantastic to, sorry 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>I rambled too much. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>No, it's cool. Where can people go to find your work on the net? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>Well, like I have my own kind of portfolio website that I'm always updating, and that's ab as in Alec Brady ab sound site.com. I just kind of post stuff up now and then I'm also on the, max for live. I'll post my stuff up there. I sometimes post on the mono forums and muff wiggler, but mostly a lot of the stuff I'm doing now is gonna be on, save By Technologies website and that's just, save by technology.com. We post up stuff there for the, I do an Ableton user group, the Toronto one, once a month. So anything to do with that is always there. And you can, you can come see me at Save By Technology. I'm there Monday to Friday if you just wanna, you know, have a chat about Max or take a look at Ableton Push or whatever, like, I'll be there. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, I actually got, I, I'm thinking of doing a little trip out to Toronto pretty soon. I may just end up showing up there one day. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Alec: </b>Yeah, by all means, I, you know, I'd, I'd love to come see you Darwin Alright, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well thanks a lot for spending the time and we'll talk to you again soon. Okay. See ya. Alright, bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And there's the podcast. Pretty fascinating guy, huh? Well, I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did. I want to thank you again for your listenership. I want to thank all those who have, supported me through this first Kickstarter campaign. It's been a really humbling and wonderful experience to have that kind of support.
