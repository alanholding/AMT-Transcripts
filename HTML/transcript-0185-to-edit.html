<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, today I am getting the chance to talk to somebody who, for the first time, so you're gonna get to listen in on my first conversation. This artist is named, <span style="color:red" data-ts="23.305" data-end_ts="23.725" title="23.305" id=c_"23.305">__Leanna__</span> Ani. She was introduced to me by, Clifton Cameron, someone who's kind of, I bump into him at trade shows all the time. He always wrangles me and shows me the cool gear. And he wrote me a note and basically said, Hey, look, this is the real thing. Spend some time talking to her. It's, it's important. I did a little background research and I realized this is a person I needed to talk to. So, with that, I will introduce you to, Leanna Ani <span style="color:red" data-ts="52.655" data-end_ts="53.005" title="52.655" id=c_"52.655">__Heyna__</span>. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leanna Primiani: </b>I'm terrific. Thanks so much for having me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Ah, thanks so much for taking the time to be, part of this. I am so curious about how you will explain your work. Because I looked at your site and looked at some of your background information. It kind of seems like you do everything. So why don't we have you define yourself to the listener? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leanna: </b>Oh, that's interesting. I feel like I don't, I feel like I have a teeny tiny little niche, so that's interesting that you think I do everything. Right now, I think, my musical voice has developed into a combination of orchestral and electronic. I'm a classically trained, composer and conductor. I was a conductor first. I've been to conservatories and, I have two master's degree and I have a DMA from, USC. And my music has been played, you know, chamber music and orchestral music all over. And I've conducted, you know, the national symphony. And I've held positions as a music director, with both opera and ballet companies, all over the, the, us. So I've had that total hardcore classical background. And it was interesting for me because, you know, especially as I was working, I was always very interested in new music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leanna: </b>And if your listeners aren't familiar with that, you know, living composers, but somebody, you know, I mean, my mother used to describe it as, you know, kitten on the keys kind of stuff, which I love. <laugh>. <laugh>, they never understood me, which was fine. They let me do my thing. Right. But, and I remember I was, you know, conducting some Japanese, you know, piece and, you know, it had a lot of sound and or a lot of, you know, direction on the score as to how players should play. And I always took that. 'cause a lot of, new music composers do do that. It's a little bit of a, it's kind of a trend if you're not familiar with that. And when I was conducting Mozart Strauss, Prokofiev, Tchaikovsky, I would always, you know, the most important thing to me was always the sound. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leanna: </b>You know, the string sound like you just can't sit there and just play. Like it's gotta be something else. You've gotta change the vibrato. You've gotta put that note on a different string, put the bow in a different place, move the bow faster, move the bow slower, start at the tip of the bow, start at the, you know, and move that, trumpets, like, what are you doing with your sound? How is that going? What's your mouthpiece? Is it, you know, what's the back boar? What is that? You know, what are you using wind? How are you changing your sound to reflect what's going on in the whole thing? So I was always constantly, my main concern, always as a conductor was sound, how to create a sound. Because if not, you just, you might as well to me put on a recording and here the Berlin, you know, Philharmonic, like, why would you come to the Akron Symphony and just hear that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leanna: </b>I mean, try to, you know, put a little something on it and do something different. And I was, excuse me, I was working with Peter Ush in Europe, and he's kind of a, he's a, what people would consider a spectral composer, but his, if you don't know his music, it's, it's really amazing. And he does, some electronic music too, but mostly orchestral and chamber music and, live instrumentation. We were working. And he said to me, he's like, you really should compose. I'm like, you're, I can't compose. What are you talking about? She's like, man, all you do is think about sound like, what are you doing? Go write it if you don't like what's happening. And I thought, oh, okay. So, you know, that's kind of how I came to it. And I was, and I've always been interested in electronics. And I worked at the, CC mix in, Paris at <span style="color:red" data-ts="289.245" data-end_ts="289.565" title="289.245" id=c_"289.245">__Occus__</span> studio <span style="color:red" data-ts="290.265" data-end_ts="290.485" title="290.265" id=c_"290.265">__on__</span> a U <span style="color:red" data-ts="290.845" data-end_ts="291.085" title="290.845" id=c_"290.845">__pick__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leanna: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. That was my first introduction. And then since then, <span style="color:red" data-ts="295.625" data-end_ts="295.845" title="295.625" id=c_"295.625">__Kea__</span>, which is a really cool thing. And that's how Cameron and I met. He actually bought my old <span style="color:red" data-ts="301.465" data-end_ts="301.685" title="301.465" id=c_"301.465">__Kea__</span>. I see. And, yeah. And that, you know, that stuff is, you know, it's interesting. It's really cool and it sounds great, but you know, when you're on a, if you're on any kind of a time crunch <span style="color:red" data-ts="315.595" data-end_ts="315.815" title="315.595" id=c_"315.595">__or__</span> you have to do something, you know, live, and I don't know, I, I always found it. I was always, you know, kind of fighting it. So I, I had to look for things that really worked for me and in my studio and with my voice and with kind of live instruments that was very reliable. And when you went somewhere that people would be performing your music, you know, it's not a fight with, you know, with <span style="color:red" data-ts="343.935" data-end_ts="344.055" title="343.935" id=c_"343.935">__a__</span> stage manager as to your gear and what's going on, and just try to simplify everything. Sure. So, kind of moved now to soft since as, and you know, I have some, I have some modular, which we can certainly talk about 'cause that's such a fabulous black hole. It's so much fun, <laugh>, but, <laugh>. But for me, you know, the combination of those things and how to use it and how to create that sound with those kind of traditional orchestral instruments, for me, that's the most important thing. And that's where my focus is now. And that's where my work is headed. Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="385.355" data-end_ts="385.645" title="385.355" id=c_"385.355">__From__</span> going from the orchestra world into electronics. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, it's interesting, I saw you do a video, I think it was on Facebook, and I think it was sort of like a, you know, sort of like the, we, my releases just dropped video. Right. But it's you sitting Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leanna: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="401.845" data-end_ts="402.045" title="401.845" id=c_"401.845">__Ralph__</span> wouldn't have 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>To Yeah. It's, it's you sitting in front of your sort of like studio work environment, which is really unique. Yes. 'cause like to your left and right are computer monitors in the center is a little stand with a score. And then off to the side is a modular system. And I've, I was like, if that isn't like the perfect metaphor for modern composer's, workspace, I don't know what would be, you know, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leanna: </b>Right. And then you didn't see all my slaves in the, you know, on the side. Yeah. When I compose, no matter what it is, I put, you know, pencil to paper every day that's always in front of me. Just 'cause I, you know, that's how I learned that was, you know, my background. I don't know if it's a crutch, and it doesn't matter what it is, but that's always in front of me, kind of, you know, making my notes and doing my thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I think it's interesting that you came to composition from, from conducting. Although, you know, when you explain sort of like what your experience was conducting, it makes a lot of sense because you felt like it was already your integral job to help shape the sound. So why not also help choose the notes, right. That, that actually makes a lot of sense. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leanna: </b>Right. And even more so, which I find the most important thing. And, you know, you can certainly tell me what you think. It's always been the most important thing for me, for a composer of any genre. It doesn't matter if you're writing a song or you know, you're on your <inaudible> or whatever it is that, that you use your time wisely. And what do I mean by that? You know, artists have a physical frame that is where they work. You know, you can't take the paint on the floor to the museum to hang, or you can't sell it. Right. It has to be on the canvas. So, you know, our canvas <span style="color:red" data-ts="522.385" data-end_ts="522.605" title="522.385" id=c_"522.385">__as__</span>, as music, as composers and creators of sound is time. And how does one use that time? So it has shape, it has movement. It doesn't just sit there and kind of meander. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leanna: </b>Like for me it's about, you know, moving that forward and using my time that actually architecturally makes sense. Because I can't tell you how many concerts I've been in. It doesn't matter if I'm sitting in a symphony orchestra or if I'm going to somebody playing, you know, their modular and it's, and like the first three or five minutes are awesome. And then like, you're 10 minutes in and it's so boring 'cause it's just doing nothing. Right. And then the ending's kind of good. And it really takes a lot, at least for me, it does, it takes a lot of thought and skill and preparation and, you know, kind of creating an architecture and a form to put everything in its place so that it does make sense. So when I was conducting something like, you know, I don't know, let's say Beethoven and the symphony and everything falls in its place. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leanna: </b>There's a reason why there's a form and music comes back and it does X, Y, and Z. And then once I started writing, and then I had on my composer hat, and I, then I started conducting again, it's like every, everything became 3D. Like, it made more sense. It's like, oh, I get it. That's why the strings come in there at that note with the flutes, because before he did the X and the Y and everything kind of builds up to that moment. Ah, I get it now I can do that. Right. But what's that form? So then you create your own form or however one does it. I've created my own form for this. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But all of that, to me, it's about the sound and the development of the sound and how that sound moves through time in a satisfactory way. That's, for me, that's the most important thing in my music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, going back to, your work as a conductor and your, your background as conductor, I have to admit that for me, the whole world of conductors is like a black box. I have no idea how you become a conductor. I have no idea what that looks like as a gig, nor do I have an idea of where it fits into the spectrum of like, feeling like art making. Right. Right. And so I thought if I get you on the horn, I <laugh> I wanna ask you to sort of like, help me work my way through that for yourself. How does that end up coming? How did you become a conductor? What was sort of like this, the approach through like your personal journey plus your schooling and, and how do you get like, you know, it's, it's even impossible to imagine how you get like a first gig as a conductor because it seems like that's like saying, you know, oh, you know, my first job I'm an astronaut. Yeah. My first job is gonna be a senator. Right. Or something like that. Right, right. It seems like too huge of a jump for like a first gig. So I'm curious, how do you, how does that even happen? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leanna: </b>Well, it happens carefully and excruciatingly and it's very difficult <laugh>, and I'm not gonna lie about it. And also being a woman is not easy. So there was that on top of it. But, you know, look, if you <span style="color:red" data-ts="732.725" data-end_ts="732.965" title="732.725" id=c_"732.725">__wanna__</span>, if you wanna do anything, you can do it. But I came from a performance background, so not a creative. Like, I'm gonna go in and I'm going to create music and I'm gonna write a song and my buddies are gonna play it. And my band, I just came from, you know, I studied piano and I played the flute and I played in orchestras and chamber ensembles and things like that. So when I did that, you know, all I did was interpret. You know, I sat, you know, I had a piece of music in front of me my whole life. So being a conductor or helping lead a group, if it was too big, and being the one that dictated the pace and the shape and how somebody comes in and really putting your own stamp on it, it was just kind of almost a natural extension from performance. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leanna: </b>Okay. Of your own piano piece. Right. Because you can interpret that how you want. And then you have a couple more people and you talk about how that goes. And then, you know, kind of bigger and bigger ensembles. I <span style="color:red" data-ts="794.765" data-end_ts="794.925" title="794.765" id=c_"794.765">__kind__</span>, I always knew that I wanted to do that from the time I was very young. My aunt took me to the opera when I was like eight. I grew up in the Central Valley in California, and she would go to San Francisco Opera on, on Sunday morning. So we'd leave at like 5:00 AM and then we'd have, you know, we'd stop. We'd stop and have breakfast and we'd have lunch with all of her. She was a spinster. And we'd stop and have lunch with her friends and they'd have like, you know, a couple of vodka martinis <span style="color:red" data-ts="826.345" data-end_ts="826.565" title="826.345" id=c_"826.345">__at__</span> like 1130 and be totally smashed. And then take us over to the opera house. I am not lying. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, that sounds like opera. The fun way, man. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leanna: </b>Oh yeah. Oh, that's, why do you think everyone goes? They just get, you know, they get blotto and then they went to the bar before the opera started and then she, she handed me my ticket and said, well, there's somebody in Greendale, I'll help you find it. I wanna finish my drink. And I was like, okay, <laugh>, you just <span style="color:red" data-ts="852.005" data-end_ts="852.165" title="852.005" id=c_"852.005">__kinda__</span> wandered around, found your seat, and me be back at the bar at the, you know, at the intermission. Okay. And then we'd drive home. Okay. Well that was the way they did it, I guess. So that was kind of my musical childhood, you know, growing up. And I thought, well, I don't wanna sing. 'cause that guy's, you know, that girl's pretty big, so <span style="color:red" data-ts="872.165" data-end_ts="872.285" title="872.165" id=c_"872.165">__I__</span> wonder what that guy's doing in the pit That looks really good. <laugh>, he's in charge. Yeah. That's <span style="color:red" data-ts="876.325" data-end_ts="876.405" title="876.325" id=c_"876.325">__it__</span>. That's it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leanna: </b>And so, you know, I went to music school and studied and, you know, did my thing and just went out and conducted, you know, got assistant conductor positions and with small orchestras and conducted a lot of youth orchestras. And then, you know, just kind of worked my way up and got bigger things and there were like small competitions and, you know, look, it's a, it's a slog. I'm not gonna lie. And the more I did it, the more I realized that I didn't really care for performing. And it's like, does the world need another Beethoven symphony? Really? I don't know. It just, the, the, allure of it wore off, as I started to do it more. And then, you know, when I, when I started conducting ballet and opera, I was in the pit, which was really great. And the music is so, in, in America, I don't know if people are familiar, but we're so lucky to have that Balanchine tradition instead of that kind of old fashioned, you go to the, you know, you go to the ballet and you see like a two hour story ballet, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leanna: </b>Mm-Hmm. Like Giselle or, or Nutcracker, whatever. Yeah. But for us as Americans, we've had these, you know, balancing ballets where we've gone, we've seen Petruska, we see all those Stravinsky ballets we've seen ag <span style="color:red" data-ts="961.015" data-end_ts="961.235" title="961.015" id=c_"961.015">__on__</span> and all of that. And then all these, you know, that kind of open the door to all this incredible music with dance that is not so classical and traditional. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And they're sweet. So you, when you go to the ballet, you see like, you know, three or four different ballets from three or four different composers, which I found to be, it's so unique. And what's so great about the ballet is that, especially with any modern music, or like with Stravinsky, like with <span style="color:red" data-ts="992.505" data-end_ts="992.795" title="992.505" id=c_"992.505">__Agon__</span>, sometimes people find it hard to get their head around it, which I, you know, I can understand if you're not trained in it, but when you go to the ballet, it's like the melody is on the stage <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leanna: </b>And when you see it and you hear it, it's like, oh my gosh, I get it. I get it. There it is, it's visual for me. So that's what I always loved about, especially working with ballet. And then of course, you know, operas just, it's my guilty pleasure. Don't, don't tell anybody, <laugh>, but it's so, you know, it's so much fun. And, but even then, I just, you know, it's just a slog like pure ballet conduct. You always do nutcrackers and there are fewer and fewer companies that have live orchestras. So there are few and fewer of those gigs. And then when you go, it starts like the day after Thanksgiving, and you go into like, after the new year, and it's six shows a week. And, you know, it's just becomes like, kind of, I mean, it's a great piece, don't get me wrong. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leanna: </b>It's a grind, it's a grind, it's a grind, and you're away from your family. And it's just, and then, you know, and then this performance thing came and I just thought, ugh, why are we doing this? Someone's gonna turn on a record in a few years anyway because nobody can afford having an orchestra. Right. Because it's so expensive. So let's do something else. So, I just, I hated being on the road, and so I just, I have it now in my home. I have a great studio that I just built and, you know, just working and writing music and it's just such a much nicer life for me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's fantastic. That's what a, what a great story. And, but also, what a great example of like taking like, sort of synthesizing a career or a life out of all this kind of like disparate mm-Hmm. <affirmative> kind of interests and things that you're drawn into rather than that you plan out ahead of time. And I, I, I find those kind of, those kinds of things really interesting. Now, one of the things I'm curious about then is now as, as you've been a composer, first of all, one of the things you didn't say about your current work is that you just, but I mentioned it, so I'm trying to help you out here, man, <laugh>, thank you. Is you and it's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leanna: </b>So bad. That's why I sit in my hole <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You've done a recent release under the name <span style="color:red" data-ts="1130.825" data-end_ts="1131.045" title="1130.825" id=c_"1130.825">__EA__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leanna: </b>Correct? <span style="color:red" data-ts="1132.425" data-end_ts="1132.645" title="1132.425" id=c_"1132.425">__Ea__</span> correct. Anna. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright. I didn't screw it up too bad. Great. And the, the release is called Five Mice and it was Yes. Really. It's really a beautiful, beautiful piece. It's available on practically every online, environment. Did you, did you do physical release too, or is it all electronic release? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leanna: </b>I have not. This is my first foray into being a solo artist. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, I just wanted to do a digital release just so I can concentrate on kind of how that works because it's a whole new thing for me. Yeah. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It prevents you from having to like set up a card table on your front lawn and sell 'em to people driving past, right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leanna: </b>Right. God, yeah, absolutely. Yeah. And then there's all of, you know, like my mother's friends who are like, oh honey, I don't understand how the iTunes link works, <laugh>, can you help me <laugh>? I'm like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1187.325" data-end_ts="1187.525" title="1187.325" id=c_"1187.325">__oh__</span>, can you send a copy, honey? I can't get it to work. <laugh>. Okay. It's hilarious. So I make some copies for friends, you know, it's sweet. I'm glad they, like, I'm glad they're willing to try it <laugh>. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So in listening, in listening through the release, it's in, in a very real way. It's, it is your voice in, in that, when I like go on your site and I kind of review some of the cinematic work that you've done, the, the work you've done for film and stuff like that, it really kind of ties to that. What for you represents the difference or sort of like the personal leap that you had to take to put together a solo recording, a recording that, that you were gonna say, you know, this is, this is an art piece rather than something that's a score for something else. Right. How did you Right. What, what was like the personal movement? Because quite frankly, that's something that I struggle with. I, I do a lot of work for a lot of things, but I have, I have struggled with the idea of saying, well now this becomes my artwork. Right. It right. It seems hard to like either, I don't know if that's elevating it as much as just kind of changing its context. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leanna: </b>No, see here, and here's the thing, you know, I had all my classical hat because I write orchestral music and chamber music and things like that, art songs. I don't, I don't write song songs, but you know, that kind of art, classical, hardcore stuff. And then I have my, you know, cinematic voice and, you know, it's such a struggle to go back and forth for me. And, you know, there are things that I love that I get to do when I write fulfillment TV that I, you know, not everything because you have to, you know, do what the director says and they hired you to do a job and you know, you have to make it sound like what they hired you to do. Right. But, you know, I'd say as I was developing my sound as a composer, there were things that I gravitated to that I really loved to do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leanna: </b>And it's so funny because the two, the two camps, which I find very odd, are so different. And they don't, I don't know if they don't like each other, they don't talk to each other, they talk down to each other. So if I'm talking to my composer friends and you know, my composer mentors, it's like, oh my God, you do electronic music? Oh, you're not a serious composer, blah, blah, blah, blah. And then you talk to the electronic guy, oh my God, you're a concert composer. You could never understand electronic blah, blah blah. So it's like, you can never win. Right? Right, right. So I stopped talking to everybody, so I sit in my hole. So <laugh>, but you know, it was interesting. I was looking at, I was writing this orchestra music and it was fine, but you know, I'm writing it and I'm like, you know, there are parts of it I like. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leanna: </b>I'm like, that's so stupid. Why am I writing music that I only like part of it? It doesn't make sense. And then I thought, you know, something's off. So I'm going to look at people that I admire. I don't necessarily like want to sound like them, but like their path and what they've accomplished like that. Like, well, let's look at people I admire and see what they did and how they got to where they are. And I'm telling you, for me, what I have seen, so many people have come through the, I'm going to be an independent artist and I'm going to release my stuff independently and I'm going to come through this. And not only are directors in film and I'm going to get work that way, but I'm also going to get discovered by, or they have been discovered by orchestras and chamber music groups and kind of in that world as well. And it's always because they, for whatever reason, they combined their voice or they did something with their, they just went off on a tangent or just said, forget it, I'm gonna do this and this is what I'm gonna do and I'm gonna release my own thing 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And do <span style="color:red" data-ts="1434.655" data-end_ts="1434.855" title="1434.655" id=c_"1434.655">__all__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leanna: </b>Understand. So for me, I was, yeah, really. So for me, I'm like, okay, I'm taking all the things I like to, I've, I'm a little schizophrenic, like doing this. And then going back to that when I don't like a hundred percent of this and I don't like a hundred percent of that, why don't I like a hundred percent of everything? Like, why am I killing myself <laugh>? So Right. Like, what, what am I doing? You know? So I looked at it and there were elements of sound design that I love to do that I think are important. And then there were elements of just regular composition that I love to do and my voice that may not have been so possibly my no choice, for lack of a better word, is not so in vogue at the moment. Right. Okay. So how does one, you know, so <span style="color:red" data-ts="1485.385" data-end_ts="1485.605" title="1485.385" id=c_"1485.385">__how__</span>, so how do you do that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leanna: </b>So I took kind of both sounds, both voices, if you will, of things that I like to do. Like I love being a minimalist, but not the kind of minimalist that you hear in a movie that's like, kind of four four. But kind of like, what is a minimalist, like going down that road? What is that? I mean, I like Philip laugh, but I also love, you know, but he does his thing and how does that work with Steve Rice and just <span style="color:red" data-ts="1515.985" data-end_ts="1516.205" title="1515.985" id=c_"1515.985">__his__</span>, that rhythm. And then, then you put in John Adams, like, 'cause that's totally different, but people still consider that minimalism. I'm not quite sure how it's <laugh> anything but minimal. Right. And then there's somebody like John Luther Adams. Are you familiar with him? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>No, I'm not. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leanna: </b>He won Pulitzer Prize a couple of years ago in a piece called Become Ocean. It's with the Seattle Symphony if anybody's interested in that. I mean, talking about minimal man. Wow. But it is, it's 45 or 55 minutes and there are three crescendos and it the way, and it's a palin palindrome. So it starts, and then it goes back exactly backwards. It's, I'm telling you, this piece is magnificent, but that kind of minimalism is just so different than that kind of Philip Glass, rhythmically driven Steve Wright kind of a sound. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leanna: </b>So like, how does that happen? And if I were to do that, what would be my normal tendency as a composer? So developing that is what I did with Honestia. And then using that idea of, of developing my sound as a classical composer, taking those chops that I've developed and using them when, when using electronics and sound design and building my sound palette that way. So that's how those two voices came together. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. Now, one of the things that I'm curious about is, again, because coming from a more classical position, one of the things about classical composition is that you do your, you do your sound design by sort of like ensemble selection. Right. You know, can you basically say, okay, if if I, you know, if I want this kind of harmonic, adjustment, I'm <span style="color:red" data-ts="1633.685" data-end_ts="1633.765" title="1633.685" id=c_"1633.685">__gonna__</span> add some clarinets, or if I want to Sure. You know, a a nice, filter sweep, I'm gonna bring in, you know, <laugh>, I mean Right, exactly. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leanna: </b>Like the equivalent, right? I'm gonna take out the, I'm gonna take out the high strains. I'm gonna take out the bases. Right? Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Absolutely. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1649.485" data-end_ts="1649.725" title="1649.485" id=c_"1649.485">__Minute__</span> you manipulate your sound by, by ensemble selection. And, and so that kind of helps drive the orchestration in the writing to a certain extent when you're, when you're writing, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leanna: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1660.425" data-end_ts="1660.645" title="1660.425" id=c_"1660.425">__Of__</span> course, because you have to limit yourself, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. When you're writing with electronics, you don't have those limits. I mean, any one of your software or hardware synthesizers can do all the sound. Right. <laugh>, you can do completely swamp the frequency world. Right. So how do you combine sort of like the classical writing and composition process, which you sound sounds like is very much your, your personal, practice. Right? How do you combine that with, with this sort of like wide open Tamil world that electronics offers? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leanna: </b>Well, here's the thing that I've found. It's like, you know, if you've ever sat down to write, to compose anything or write a song or whatever it is you, and the more you do it, the more you have a sound and you have a voice. What does that mean? Just what you, what you gravitate towards where your hands fall on the guitar. Right? Like, just because everyone's voicing is a little different and that's what makes them unique. Right. Where do your hands fall on the piano? Just naturally, you know? 'cause some people fall on the black keys and voice difference <span style="color:red" data-ts="1737.555" data-end_ts="1737.775" title="1737.555" id=c_"1737.555">__and__</span> people fall on the white keys and voice differently. Some people never use their left hand or just use a OneNote, other people use an octave or, you know, however that works for everybody. Just that is a selection. And then you go from there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leanna: </b>So, when I compose, especially when I'm using, you know, like if you're, oh, you've got a modular, you know, you've got your modular rack there going and just what you choose, how you choose to filter, where you go every time. How you move those knobs every single time and where you land is your voice. Because some people really like that grit and they like that dirt and they like that aggression. And other people like me, I never use that. Like that would, I would never, that never shows up for me. Right. It's something completely droney and different and, you know, my, you know, my harmonic palette is just different than that. And so my a that in and of itself because where you gravitate towards for sure, but then I also purposefully limit myself. I purposefully limit my palette. You know, even the selection of, you know, am I going to use massive with in aorta? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leanna: </b>Maybe I don't use <span style="color:red" data-ts="1818.065" data-end_ts="1818.555" title="1818.065" id=c_"1818.065">__incorta__</span> this time. Maybe that's too, you know, I maybe that's not right for this piece. Maybe zebra, what am I gonna do with that zebra? And am I going to use it with Veeva or am I going to use it with Hive? And what filter am I going to use? I'm really huge. Oh, you know, just using, I have a, oh, not that, oh, that, those UAD those UAD plugins, right? And then I use those cush cush and, and I'm big, sound toys. I live in sound toys. Oh my God. You know, like, how do you like just using those, but why use all of those? Just limit yourself to one, but really use it. And how is that going to shape and how does it change the sound and how does it shape the sound? And then what are you using for your mastering plugin? And just, just use the one, you know what I mean? You don't have to go crazy, but if you can limit that palette, that seems to really help. Because if you don't, then A, you're never gonna get anything done. And b, it's gonna sound like a mishmosh because you're gonna have everything in the kitchen sink in there. And it's not gonna make any sense musically, my opinion. This is my opinion. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I, I was wondering though how you'd approach that, because it does seem like when, when everything's available, you can spend all your time just with choices and never actually making any mu any music. Right, exactly. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1904.375" data-end_ts="1904.595" title="1904.375" id=c_"1904.375">__And__</span>, and also there, so, so you actually do a lot of your voice selection and, and instrument selection prior to doing the composition? Is that what you're kind of saying? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leanna: </b>Yes. Yes. I have, you know, I say I would, especially if I'm under the gun Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But like, maybe I would, you know, kind of go through and listen to things and certainly that's the fun part and kind of develop my sound palette. But once my sound palette in my head is set, whatever that means for that particular piece, I try not to deviate it. And that's my orchestral training. Right. It's like, okay, you have to write for a string quartet and a piano. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1945.185" data-end_ts="1945.475" title="1945.185" id=c_"1945.185">__Well__</span>, I can't throw in a flute for like three measures <laugh>, you know, wrong. So, so my, my head is already in that space. That might not be good. That might not be, you know, the right thing for everybody. But that's, you know, I'm, I'm happy to make that choice because that's kind of, that was how I was trained. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. You mentioned earlier this idea of sometimes going to concerts or to performances and the, the start is like super engaging, but then it kind of bores you after a while until it finally wakes up at the end. Right? Right. And you kind of compare that with, you know, even with classical <span style="color:red" data-ts="1986.065" data-end_ts="1986.285" title="1986.065" id=c_"1986.065">__com__</span> composers work, who, you know, were able to kind of maintain your interest throughout the piece, you know, through different, different narrative curves and all that kind of stuff. Stuff. I think a lot of people in the world of electronics spend so much time getting that first sound that they fall in love with it. Yeah. And then never really think about the development of the piece. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leanna: </b>Exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What, from your, what are some like tricks or some ideas that you use for yourself to spur yourself into getting out of the sound and into the composition? You know what, I'm, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2021.765" data-end_ts="2021.805" title="2021.765" id=c_"2021.765">__what__</span> I'm trying to get at is, is like 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leanna: </b>I know exactly what you mean. Okay. Alright. I know, exactly. And that is like, the number one question I think is as electronic composers or creators of electronic music that we have to ask ourselves. And I think the first thing you have to do is give yourself a time limit. That is why, you know, artists have that, have that canvas, and it's a certain size, and we need to give ourselves a canvas because as we don't give ourselves a canvas, it's not gonna help us. And then you have to go into your timeline or whatever it is and say, okay, how do I, what is the shape of this work? What compels me? Now it could be one straight line, right? With a few iterations up and down. Right. It can be, you know, big, you know, high peaks and low peaks or however you wanna make that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leanna: </b>I'm waving my hands around like, you can see me <laugh>. I'm <laugh> sorry about that. It's, you know, like when you physically say, okay, I'm gonna make a piece that's 10 minutes. You write a timeline and then write a line on a sheet of paper and try to divvy up where things happen. You know, 45 seconds, I'm gonna do this a minute and 10. But it has to, you know, you have to give yourself some kind of architectural shape and what you want it to do. Get loud, get soft. You know, my low <span style="color:red" data-ts="2111.175" data-end_ts="2111.375" title="2111.175" id=c_"2111.175">__pass__</span> filter's gonna be here for the first time. Like, why you have to throw everything in the kitchen sink in the first minute. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leanna: </b>You know? Right. Like, spread it out. I can't tell you how many pieces I hear of composers and the reason why everything sounds so great in the beginning. It's 'cause they throw everything in it. Right. Right. And so, but don't throw it in. So like, you hear it and the first two minutes are awesome and then it's just boring. Well, maybe you've got too many things going on too quickly. Spread it out. Like there's nothing that you know, and everyone's guilty of this. I know I'm certainly guilty of it. You know, just give things more time to develop, but then change it at the right time. And that's when you know your architecture and having a form, it's so critical. So for me, I can't function without a form. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>At all. Now for the form, for the development of a form though, do you do anything like sort of make preliminary graphic scores or like sketches in a sketchbook or something like that? Or do you immediately start putting notes on paper? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leanna: </b>Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I, that's the first thing I do is, I have a, I have a kind of a graphic score, but I've developed a kind of a, I've developed, my own, which I think adds to my voice. The way I create form, I do it both in my classical writing and I do it in my, my electronic writing. I did it on this album, five Mice. The reason why there are five songs, so it's really a through composed piece. It's about 35 minutes. And each piece is a diff obviously, you know, different lengths. But those lengths correspond to the overall form. And then those smaller pieces have that same form within them. I see. And then, you know, sectional, so I used something called, you know, the Golden Ratio. I used fee, Barock did it, but he did it with measure numbers and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2233.855" data-end_ts="2234.145" title="2233.855" id=c_"2233.855">__soci__</span> numbers. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leanna: </b>Okay. Which I find incredibly compelling. But I, instead of measure numbers, for me, I use time. So I have a time calculator, because my daughter's, the math one, not me, but I use a time calculator and they're all online. You can get it online. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I say, you know, it's a 10 minute piece and where is the golden mean? Where is that Fibonacci number? Interesting. Right. Yeah. So, and I find it, and it's seven minutes and 42 seconds. So I know that's a big one. Right, right. That's the, from this is the way I organize my music. This is not interesting steadfast, but I do that because measure numbers don't make any sense if somebody is playing it too slow or too fast. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leanna: </b>For me, it's all about time and how we perceive it. And the problem with music that we have as composers, it's not like art. You go into a museum and you take it all in immediately. And no matter what it is, if it's a Pollock or if it's a Picasso or whatever it is, everybody can point to the left corner and say, that's red. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leanna: </b>And it's five feet wide and three feet high, and it's sitting here and this is what it, and everyone can basically describe it. You might not like it, but everyone has a perception of what that is. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>We do not have, yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2323.405" data-end_ts="2323.525" title="2323.405" id=c_"2323.405">__There's__</span>, there's some real, there's some reality to it. You know, there's some physical reality. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leanna: </b>There's a physical reality. And the problem, not that it's a problem. Well, it's our <span style="color:red" data-ts="2332.925" data-end_ts="2333.125" title="2332.925" id=c_"2332.925">__pro__</span>, it's our problem as complain <laugh>. Our problem is, you know, people have to sit there and listen. It <span style="color:red" data-ts="2340.405" data-end_ts="2340.645" title="2340.405" id=c_"2340.405">__take__</span>, it takes time. And you have to do something that compels the listener to keep listening. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, right? Mm-Hmm <affirmative>. So when you keep changing sounds all the time that your ear is gonna get tired if you don't bring something back or have some kind of arch, you know, the listener's going to get bored and either, you know, turn it off or get up and walk out or fall asleep or whatever. You know, people do. So I think that that architecture and that form is so important. It's the most important thing. And even when I write my, even when I write, you know, a film score that's still in my mind because there is an architecture to what's happening in the story. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leanna: </b>You know, they have a form, how that goes. What is that form? Because you kind of have to follow that. It's not just blindly writing music. And when I sit down and I hear, and there are some great scores out there, especially in tv, I mean killer, man, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2407.415" data-end_ts="2407.835" title="2407.415" id=c_"2407.415">__killer__</span>. I love it. Like, you know, stranger Things. I think everyone loves that score, right? I mean, my God, fabulous. But you know, it's like episode six, man, really? You can't, like, you can't pitch that up. We've heard this now 25 times. Can you pitch it up please? <laugh>, can it be maybe just a little faster? Could you put it upside down? Could you put it in, you know, like get it out <span style="color:red" data-ts="2434.515" data-end_ts="2434.595" title="2434.515" id=c_"2434.515">__of__</span> that profit. Like I get it, we recognize it. Put it in the June 1 0 6, please. Like just something different, <laugh>. So there's something to be No, and I, you know, look, I love that. I think those guys are geniuses, don't get me wrong. But you know, if you're gonna pay something over 12 hours and you're gonna write all that music, you've gotta think of, you know, your architecture and your sound of what's going to be tired because the listener 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Just listener fatigue. 'cause <span style="color:red" data-ts="2462.555" data-end_ts="2462.675" title="2462.555" id=c_"2462.555">__That's__</span> right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leanna: </b>Listener. And as the story gets going and the story develops and the characters change, you've gotta do that too. So what does that look like? Why does it always, why does the tune always have to be the same? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, if you have one or the motive or that little, or that lick that you do, or the pace of that pulse, why does that always have to be the same? Maybe pitch that up a little bit, maybe backwards, maybe. You know what I mean? It's like, that's when the compositional, even if you're not a trained composer, just learning those compositional tricks. That's where I think that's where the juice and the interest come from. It's one thing to make these sounds. I make some great sounds. I know you make fabulous sounds. I know so many people make incredible sounds with their gear and it's great. But next step then what do 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You do? Yeah. Next stop. Right. You know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leanna: </b>And that to me is the most, you know, important thing is to just develop and keep the interest going. And that's really hard. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, you know, I, I really appreciate you talking about this because one of the things that a lot of times people aren't able to do is like, articulate that process and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2534.325" data-end_ts="2534.445" title="2534.325" id=c_"2534.325">__I__</span>, but it was clear to me that, you know, you're really thoughtful about how you do your composition and, and your orchestration and stuff. And so I really did want to dive into it. And I, I appreciate you going down that path because there's some really inspiring stuff there. I I do appreciate it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leanna: </b>Oh, thank 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You. Unfortunately our time is coming to coming up, but before we go, what I want to do is hear about what's next for you. What's, what's next on your plate. You just came out with this release. You've, you've maintained a busy schedule doing composition stuff. I'm wondering what's, what's next up for you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leanna: </b>Well what's next up is I have, I've got a piano album coming out, piano and Synthesis coming out in the next couple of months. And then I'm writing, an orchestral and electronics piece, which is gonna be my first foray in the combining my voices for the orchestral world. So I'm really excited about that. And that's not gonna be until September, but of next year. But, in the meantime, I've got this piano album out and then I've got a follow up to five mice after that. Cool. So that's kind of what's on my plate. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And if people wanna follow your work or check out what you've done, what's the best place for them to do that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leanna: </b>I think the best place is probably my website and it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2616.905" data-end_ts="2617.195" title="2616.905" id=c_"2616.905">__anea__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2617.745" data-end_ts="2618.875" title="2617.745" id=c_"2617.745">__anea.com__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2619.405" data-end_ts="2619.755" title="2619.405" id=c_"2619.405">__named__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2619.775" data-end_ts="2619.995" title="2619.775" id=c_"2619.775">__on__</span> Nice. I named it twice <laugh>. That's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>A-A-N-A-S-I-A, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leanna: </b>Yes. And then I'm on, you know, Facebook and Twitter, which I find odd <laugh>, but Okay. <laugh>, and I'm on iTunes as well and Spotify, so anybody can add me to their Spotify playlist. I would really appreciate that. That's such a big deal now. So that's where I am. But the website I think is the best place. And there, there are some free downloads there as well. And I'm also on Bandcamp. There's a free download there, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Leanna, thank you so much for your time. This is super inspiring and it's kind of got my head full of compositional ideas now. So many, so many great nuggets there to, to use for, I know, for my work. And I hope my listeners get that as well. So I want to thank you for that and thank you for taking the time outta your schedule to talk. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Leanna: </b>Thank you. It was my pleasure. And I love the show and I'm just so grateful for your interest in my music, really. Thank you. Alright,
