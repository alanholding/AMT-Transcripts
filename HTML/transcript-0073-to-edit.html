<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today we, continue in pulling old podcasts from the bold days. I mean, I'm like 70 deep. So how far into history is it? Right? But we're going back to some of the earlier, podcasts and touching base with some of those people. And this week we, are going to get to talk to one of the most popular podcasts, that we had. I think because she's a, <span style="color:red" data-ts="33.3" data-end_ts="33.42" title="33.3" id=c_"33.3">__a__</span> tireless promoter for these things. It's Meg or Margaret <span style="color:red" data-ts="38.17" data-end_ts="38.66" title="38.17" id=c_"38.17">__Schelle__</span>, who teaches at Stony Brook, New York, Stony Brook, and also is right in the middle of a whole ton of things I've been following her on, on Facebook. And it's amazing the number of things that she's got juggling at any given time. And so we're gonna get a chance to kind of ping <span style="color:red" data-ts="58.82" data-end_ts="58.9" title="58.82" id=c_"58.82">__her__</span> about a bunch of that stuff today. So with that, I wanna say hi to Meg. Hi Meg, how are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret Schedel: </b>Hi, Darwin I am, you know, busy <laugh>. Yeah. As you said, that's, but I'm glad that we found a time that this would work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, I am too. So why don't we start off by having you give us kind of an overview of what all is in the hopper for you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>Somebody, I just was out visiting San Francisco and somebody asked me that same question and I was just like, I have so much going on that I can't even, I'll forget stuff if you ask me what's going on. But, what am I working on? Like this week <laugh> is a, a book chapter on the visual control of audio synthesis, sort of an overview of that throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. I just got back from San Francisco where I attended David Wessel's Memorial and also did some work with Meyer Sound. I'm working on a sonification of gait for Parkinson's patients and, starting to research another chapter on, gestural control of audio. And I'm writing a violin and alto flute piece with electronics 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Okay, that's great. <laugh>, you don't sit in a bathtub with like candles in the background and stuff very often. Do you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>You know, when I'm composing <laugh> I <span style="color:red" data-ts="146.36" data-end_ts="146.58" title="146.36" id=c_"146.36">__try__</span> take a little bit of time, but other than that, it's, it's kind of crazy. I, I also browbeat Miller Puck into letting me write a chapter in his new book when I was walking around Berkeley with him and wrote him an abstract on the plane on the way home. So <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>No time? No, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>I'm not doing enough. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>No, no rocks left unturned in your life. Yeah. That's great. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>Note to self, Darwin do not take walks with Meg if you <span style="color:red" data-ts="170.74" data-end_ts="170.9" title="170.74" id=c_"170.74">__haven__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, I'm, yeah. Well it's funny because I ran into you, on the sidewalk outside of the NAMM show. That's right. And I ended up with like three projects just because I bumped into you. I didn't know how that happened. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>I'm like, this is my friend and he's doing this stuff. And it would be really cool if you incorporated that into jitter 'cause it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="188.36" data-end_ts="188.52" title="188.36" id=c_"188.36">__really__</span>, it's good stuff. And <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. So what, first of all, let's talk a little bit about David. David, <span style="color:red" data-ts="195.42" data-end_ts="195.64" title="195.42" id=c_"195.42">__we__</span>, you said you went to his memorial. What, what interactions had you had with him and what did he kind of mean to you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>He is kind of everything to me, and I, I didn't quite realize it until he was gone. He's really one of those people that was both a consummate musician, a really like top-notch researcher who understood the science and the psychology and like a genuinely amazing leader in person. So I don't think I met anybody ever who didn't like him, didn't respect him, and didn't enjoy spending time with him. I mean, he was just, I, I just got tenure at Stony Brook and I've been sort of trying to figure out what I <span style="color:red" data-ts="250.1" data-end_ts="250.3" title="250.1" id=c_"250.1">__want__</span> to do with my life. It sounds so corny. But I was just in the Garden of Sin <span style="color:red" data-ts="257.08" data-end_ts="257.3" title="257.08" id=c_"257.08">__mat__</span> one morning and I was just like, I wanna, I wanna be David Wes. I wanna be that person that is just so happy to be doing what they're doing, that it's infectious. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, I, I hear that and I actually think that you're, you're on a good track there because, you know, if I think of him, one of the things that he was, I, as you suggest he was, he was a consummate artist as well as a, as a, a very influential person. But one of the things that I thought was pretty fantastic about him is the way that he would, he would draw people together and he would be just like, he, he seemed to have no fear of just saying, Hey, you and you <laugh> and me, let's talk. Right? Yeah. Yeah. And it was amazing the groups of people that he was able to bring together and how that ended up influencing the kind of new media arts. And so now you were out in San Francisco, you said you were, you were meeting with Meyer Meyer Sound. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>Yeah. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What were you doing with them? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>Yeah, so at the, I met the guys from Meyer at the Bone Flute to Autotune conference and they were showing off some of their new, spatializing software with Zach. He's down in San Diego and I just met them through him and we started talking and they're doing some awesome stuff and we got along. And so I don't know how this happened, but now we're, we're working on some projects together. Very specifically Meyer Sound is investing in A V B, which is this audio video bridging, which is going to have audio, video and control data, sent over ethernet. So they're building that into some of their speakers. And MOTU has started, making some interfaces with this standard. So I'm really super excited about this new sort of protocol. It's going to make installations and multi-channel audio so much easier 'cause it's just gonna reduce the number of cables that you need and it's gonna be fast. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well this is <span style="color:red" data-ts="397.4" data-end_ts="397.56" title="397.4" id=c_"397.4">__kind__</span> of interesting because, you know, over the years, and especially because I worked for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_%2774">Cycling '74</a> which means that everybody with a kooky idea shows up at the doorstep <laugh>, there have been number large numbers of groups that have proposed putting media data over ethernet wire. What makes the A V B stuff different, and why do you think it is that it's taking off where some of these other standards had not? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>So it is, driven sort of by the I <span style="color:red" data-ts="432.52" data-end_ts="432.64" title="432.52" id=c_"432.52">__e__</span> e, so the same people that made the 8 0 2 base 11 stuff. So it's actually an industry standard and it's being promoted by the auto industry, which is kind of weird. But when you think about the cars as becoming these like infotainment centers, <laugh> where they're trying to, bring in a lot of data from the sensors in the car, give you, distributed video to your passengers so that your kids don't have to watch the same video, God forbid, <laugh> and sort of integrate them and shut things down all at the same time. This time-based synchronization element that was missing from a lot of this packet switching protocol has now been implemented because they're actually able to build the switches that can re reorder the packets more quickly than the audio rate. So it's crazy town 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Yeah, it kind of is, but at the same time it's, it's interesting. Now, first of all, I'll say on, on one hand it's kind of surprising yeah. To hear that the auto industry is driving this. But if you think about it, for most people now, the best, the best speaker and amplification system they have <laugh> is the one in their cars. Yeah. It's really crazy. But beyond that, there, that's an industry that just from pure dollar standpoint, completely dwarfs anything the music industry's going to do. So it seems like that's a way, you know, when someone like that gets involved, that's a way to get these standards organizations involved as well, because now there's, you know, sort of God's money behind the whole thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>Exactly. And what's nice is that they're actually talking to the media people, so there's gonna be native O S C in a V B because they were like, oh, that's important to you guys, so okay, <laugh>, it's not a big deal for us to put that in there. So it's nice that it's not just the auto industry. They're saying, you know, these crazy multimedia artists, people have been doing this stuff for a long time, so maybe there's something we could learn from them, <laugh>. So. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>It's, it's kind of cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well it's gonna be interesting when like your brake sensors all of a sudden have an O S C message getting sent to your, your iPod or something. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>Exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>When I saw you in, in Anaheim, you also said you were doing something with wave <span style="color:red" data-ts="589.25" data-end_ts="589.6" title="589.25" id=c_"589.25">__guide__</span> something or other <laugh>. Yeah. I didn't catch the whole thing and I dunno what the hell you're talking about. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>Yeah. So the other thing that <span style="color:red" data-ts="596.56" data-end_ts="596.76" title="596.56" id=c_"596.56">__my__</span> sound is working on is wave field synthesis. And this is sort of like f f t four sound waves. So if you can think of how multiple sign waves can combine and make different Tims, this is a way that multiple sound waves can combine and make spatialized audio. So you have a bunch of really small speakers and then you're doing these incredible calculations and then you can actually place sound in space using a row of speakers and it won't have a sweet spot. It will just always sound like it's coming from that place no matter where you are in the room. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Yikes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>Yeah, <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That sounds, well first of all, that sounds incredible. And secondly, that sounds like a situation where, yet again, someone's gonna try and compel us into having 45 speakers in our living room. How does that, I mean, how does it work in the real, in the real world, how many speakers do you have to have to make this even make sense? And how, how much researchy is it versus sellable? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>Yeah, so I think the, the sound bars, if you know, that sort of paradigm soundbar stuff, right? That's starting. So that is a, a sort of real world, very simple model of, of some wayfield synthesis going on. So these, these rows of speakers, the speakers themselves are kind of small and then they're in maybe a four to five foot array for the smallest one that Meyer's making right now. Okay. But it works. And I don't know, I don't know how small you're gonna be. It's gonna be able to be made, but the fact that it has such resolution, I think as you have a really big tv, you could just have a really big wavefield synthesis thing sitting on the top of it. Why not? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure, sure. Good point. Well, and given that most people have now a living room wall dedicated to their TVs, it doesn't seem that out of line. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>Yeah. And what's nice about it is you're not then having to put the 5.1 speakers all around and the wires and everything. It's just one row and then your sub <span style="color:red" data-ts="735.52" data-end_ts="735.72" title="735.52" id=c_"735.52">__over__</span>. But it's able, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So the single row actually places things throughout a room. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Ah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>Ah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's crazy. Mind 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>Melting. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. It's mind melting. And also it seems like, well I'm glad you're involved because it seems to me like audio artists, would eat this stuff up because it's a completely new experience in terms of how you can work in an installation. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>Yeah, exactly. And so, I'm really excited to be doing this. I'm going to, I don't know how many I'm getting, and, and when, but whenever the first real prototype rolls off the line, I get to do, an installation at the lab in San Francisco. And, I'm, I could not be more excited. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Just make sure you call me when you get your prototype, because then it's gonna be party at Meg's house. <laugh>. That sounds like, that sounds like a lot of fun. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>I think it's gonna be Party at Meyer Sound. I don't think I get it at my house. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. <span style="color:red" data-ts="801.87" data-end_ts="802.36" title="801.87" id=c_"801.87">__Alright__</span>. Well then we're all going to San Francisco, I guess. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>Exactly. Yeah. So I'm, I'm desperately trying to wrap my head around the math of it all, just so that I'm not sitting there say just sort of moving buttons around without understanding it. That's kind of important to me, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and it's probably important in general because especially when you're working with the researchers and the developers of this stuff, the last thing you want to be is like, oh, okay, well let's dumb it down for the artist. Yeah. 'cause that doesn't that as soon as you start dumbing things down, you also start closing doors for exploration. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>Yeah. And I think that's what they're excited to work with me because I sort of have that, that math right. Background and I'm a chick and they're like, what <laugh>? I mean, it was, it was fun going around NAMM and sort of talking to the, the people that are doing a, b, b stuff and they're just like, wait, you're a girl and you're going to this session on A, B, b and you're asking me like, intelligent questions about it. That's just weird. And I'm like, don't be sexist. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Exactly. <span style="color:red" data-ts="869.32" data-end_ts="869.36" title="869.32" id=c_"869.32">__<laugh>__</span>, that's, that's, I mean, it is an important thing to note because again, in terms of you kind of having impact on both academia and the industry, a lot of it comes from the fact that you are, in addition to be being a good promoter of yourself and others, you also stand out in the crowd because you're a woman doing it. And because you are tenured faculty who hasn't already, you know, gone into the hot tub for the rest of their career. Yeah. <laugh> or whatever. I'm 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>Tempted, I'm tempted <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So that's, that's pretty interesting. Now you're also in the middle of doing all this book writing. To what extent is some of the, some of the tech weenie stuff that you're finding out in San Francisco gonna make its way into these books? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b><laugh>, not that stuff, that stuff right now more focused on articles, getting that out, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>How tied into IP and, sort of like closed information is all of that. I mean, obviously the A V B stuff, since it's coming through the i e e is gonna be publicly understood, but, seems to me like this, oh, what did you call it? Wave what? Synthesis 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>Wave. So wavefield synthesis. Wavefield. So a lot of, a lot of people are trying to crack this nut. So I'm, I'm, I'm sure that Meyer has their own patents on it. And, right now they're, they like had to lease some computers from like DARPA to do the FFTs quickly enough in order to make this happen. So. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So a cray a cray in every living room is in our future. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>Well, you know, in 10 years it'll be on our iPads. It's, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's crazy. Yeah, that's a good point. Good point. So what, what kind of other stuff, are you working on? So you mentioned the visual control of sound and gestural control of sound. Can you fill us in a little bit about what exactly you're talking about there? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>Yeah, so, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="992.7" data-end_ts="992.92" title="992.7" id=c_"992.7">__And__</span> especially with visual control, there's been all kinds of people with ideas about that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>There have been. And so it's, it's been hard to sort of narrow down the focus into just one chapter. I'm like, this is a whole book, but I got asked to write on the visual control of audio synthesis in the Oxford Handbook for algorithmic music. So when we think of algorithms, we more tend to think of programs, but it's really just a set of instructions. So I start with the Rhythmicon. So it was a device that Henry Cowell asked Leon Thurman to build him so that he could hear sort of very complex polyrhythms and it's controlled by a piano looking keyboard that then turns on lights which shine in these rotating discs and create polyrhythms. And I had written about that, for organized sound, oh my god, 10 years ago. Jesus. And, going through the sort of visual music people like Fishinger and John Whitney, there's also this Russian guy whose name I'm forgetting that did similar things, drawing sound waves on the film strips. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, Daphne Orum. So the ceramics machine drawing directly onto film strips, the, enokis you pick system. And then, you know, all hell breaks loose in the eighties basically. And I was like, how am I gonna, not how I'm gonna bound this? And so I thought that I would maybe not do systems that have video, but instead focus on picture still image. I see. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Instead see, okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>So, Sean Greeley does this really cool thing where he paints and then moves the picture under a microscope basically to control audio. And that's a cool project. That's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Awesome. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>Yeah. And, ya, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1119.95" data-end_ts="1120.24" title="1119.95" id=c_"1119.95">__Tony__</span> took, Chinese characters and sonified them in this like, multimedia. And I was just talking about this Macromedia, what was that program way back in the day? The multimedia Macromedia 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Director. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>Director. Yes. Good job. Darwin So trying to find 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's that's old, that's old guy. I know right there actually, I mean, it's funny you mentioned director. I, I am actually looking for a machine to run it too simply because I have a copy of, Laurie Anderson's puppet hotel. Oh wow. I would get a computer just specifically to run that. Huh. It was so beautiful. But, you know, director ancient of these finding machine, that'll run it really hard. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>Yeah. So I'm, I'm keeping an eye out at Stony Brook 'cause they never throw anything away because it's illegal. Oh, okay. So I'm quite convinced that I'll be able to find some, some old machine that some scientists decided was too slow that is in perfectly good condition, unlike the ones that we've run into the grounds in our labs. So. Right, right. If I find one, I will let you know. 'cause I also need to find one so I can try to wrap my head around what he was doing. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And then the, the final thing that I sort of broke my rule on is, Andrea Polis, I think is the name who did this cussons, where using a, computer vision on an eyeball to control audio. And I just sort of, I was like, I'm gonna break my rule for this because it's sort of the organism of vision now controlling. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>Right. And then the, I end with, Daniel Tempkin, who is using photos as a way to program the computer. So his, his language is not keyboard. It's literally taking the, the photos with the correct color balance in order to program a computer to say hello world. And so I saw that at Harvest <span style="color:red" data-ts="1239.31" data-end_ts="1239.6" title="1239.31" id=c_"1239.31">__work__</span> and I was like, Hey, you also do audio stuff, so can you make a version of this that does audio? Because I really wanna write about this in my book. Right. So I don't know how kosher that is to sort of ask someone to write something new in your overview of what's going on. But I I was just like, that is stunning to me that you're actually using photos as your, as your programming language, not just as input. Like literally you are programming with image. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. That's, that's amazing. And, and it's kind of interesting, first of all that, I mean, it makes sense to talk to him about that as a direction as you're writing about it, because if nothing else, you're the, because you're writing about it, you're extremely tuned into the history of what's going on. Yeah. And so as a result, you know, talking to an artist about how that, how that history is and how they might be able to fit into that seems totally, totally in play. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>All right. Good. <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. There you go. All right. There's your Darwin said <span style="color:red" data-ts="1302.31" data-end_ts="1302.6" title="1302.31" id=c_"1302.31">__it's__</span>, Darwin said it's fine. <laugh>. So, it's interesting that you kind of laid this out though as one where you had to kind of bound yourselves. Because when you first started talking about, and first of all, I didn't catch initially that it was about synthesis. Do you really focus on on sound generation or do you get involved in like, visuals as a controlling mechanism for mixing and stuff? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>I really focused on synthesis. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1335.87" data-end_ts="1336.16" title="1335.87" id=c_"1335.87">__Yeah__</span>. That's, that's interesting because when you first mentioned it, I, I immediately jumped to like the visual mixing. Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1343.32" data-end_ts="1343.44" title="1343.32" id=c_"1343.32">__And__</span>, all that kind of stuff and, and yeah. How there was like 40 people who all were pretty sure they knew exactly what that meant. Yeah. And, it makes me want to ask questions about the writing process, because let's face it, first of all, doing, doing one of the Oxford books means that you're actually kind of writing history. Right. You're one of those people that's getting to decide history.

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1373.26" data-end_ts="1373.48" title="1373.26" id=c_"1373.26">__Oh__</span>, okay. Not, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Not to put too big of a weight on your shoulders, but there you go. The, the question I have is how do you do that with something like media art where things are shifting so, so quickly and how something can go from the, the next great thing or the new new thing to being like over <span style="color:red" data-ts="1396.38" data-end_ts="1396.6" title="1396.38" id=c_"1396.38">__in__</span> an eye blink. How do you deal with that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>Yeah, so I, I try not to say that this is the newest and greatest and awesomest thing, you know, that's why sort of a V B right now for me is an article. 'cause I'm like, this is the newest and greatest and most optimist thing, <laugh>. But I wouldn't wanna put that in a book <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>And so, with the books and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1423.48" data-end_ts="1423.72" title="1423.48" id=c_"1423.48">__like__</span>, it's, it's been interesting, throughout the tenure process, people were really confused by me because they're like, so you perform and you write music and you program computers and you do new research on methods for human computer interaction, and you also write about history of technology <span style="color:red" data-ts="1449.62" data-end_ts="1449.84" title="1449.62" id=c_"1449.62">__and__</span> the arts and you curate art shows. So what, who are you and why do you do so many things? And I think they all relate to each other. And so I actually really think it's important to know the history of the field. And so I, I can feel comfortable talking about that and then say, here are three fairly new things that I think we can draw a parallel to the past and I'll just write about them. And they're interesting, but I'm not gonna say that this is the definitive canon. It's just trying to make connections between these things that I find interesting, trying to represent a diversity of ages, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_(software)">Jitter</a>s, sexualities, races, et cetera. So, I mean, I'll get so excited. I was like, yay, Andrea's a girl. And just trying to show what can be done and what has been done. And I guess focusing on the pieces that were more about the art and a little bit less about the technology and, and why, why they work, on a, on an aesthetic level, in addition to explaining the technology. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That makes a lot of sense. Now how, what do you do personally to sort of avoid your own biases? Or do you not worry about it <span style="color:red" data-ts="1545.04" data-end_ts="1545.24" title="1545.04" id=c_"1545.04">__and__</span> do you just embrace the thing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>I tend to use Facebook a lot. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, I noticed. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>So I'll just be like, who knows about this stuff? And then, you know, I'll try to do at least a, a five degree of difference sort of from anything that I can find, which is, is insane. And at some point I have to cut myself off. I'm like, I have to start writing now. And so, I mean, for the electronic music book with Cambridge and, and Nick and Scott, I wrote a chapter on sound art and I literally had a stack of books that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1585.2" data-end_ts="1585.32" title="1585.2" id=c_"1585.2">__w__</span> and articles like that was taller than I was. And I'm trying to condense that down into a chapter. And so at some point I just have to say, it's me. I'm writing it, I'm making these decisions, and I could have made other decisions and maybe in a parallel universe I made a different decision. So I'm fine with it. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Yeah, that makes sense. Now, you talk about sort of having your fingers in a lot of pies. You're at Stony Brook, are you in the music department? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>Okay. Are you ready for this? Yeah. Shoot. Okay. I am, my tenure is in the music department. Okay. I was hired to be in the Consortium for Digital Arts Culture and Technology. Okay. So this is a sort of umbrella organization with people from many different departments. Right. Then I am affiliated, which means that like I'm on the list of people that know about this sort of thing and could be helpful for people with the art department. So because of the sound art and the curating that I do and, and devotion gallery, I'm affiliated with the computer science department because of the sort of multimedia gaming aspect of what I do. I'm affiliated with the biomedical informatics department, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1661.18" data-end_ts="1661.47" title="1661.18" id=c_"1661.18">__then__</span> Sonifying Data and they're very interested in that. And hilariously the director, Joel Saltz, his brother, whose first name I can't remember, but his last name is Saltz, was one of the original people from theater who conceived of c <span style="color:red" data-ts="1677.39" data-end_ts="1677.47" title="1677.39" id=c_"1677.39">__d__</span> Act and he is now down in Georgia. And I, yesterday got invited to be affiliated with theater because I do a lot of collaborations with a woman there, Jeanette Yu. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. So a little of everything. So how do you Yeah, I, I wanna talk about this more pointedly because I think that there's actually a lot of people in the sort of like sonic sound, art, music, you know, triangle or, I dunno, hexagon or <laugh>, whatever the heck it is. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>Dodecahedron. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Therin. Right. There are a lot of people that get opportunities like that and some people are able to manage it and some people have trouble managing it. And the way that you see the trouble occur is that they end up not getting in depth on anything. And I would say that is not your problem. You have a tendency to really dive in depth on the things that you do. How do you maintain that focus and how do you bat away things that are going to distract you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>So yeah, I mean, I'm sure it would've been much easier for me to get tenure if I only wrote music. So I don't quite have enough pieces if you just consider me a composer and I don't have quite enough articles if you're considering me a new researcher and I don't have quite enough books if you're considering me a historian. And so I think that's the way I, I keep from the problem of, of no depth. So I have a few things that I do in depth. And for me, they all fundamentally relate. So I learn things that influence my own practice when I'm doing this kind of research, I actually really enjoy producing concerts because I'll learn more about how to do my stuff better. And I, I guess I, I kind of worry sometimes 'cause I, the one thing I do terribly is promotion. And so <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You lie, you lie like a rug because oh my 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>God, no, I'm terrible. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You don't upset. Well, I mean, it depends on, it depends on what you mean by promotion. I mean yeah, you don't go out on Times Square and hand out flyers, but what you are really good about is saying, saying, Hey, this is happening, or, Hey, I'm involved in this, or Hey, turn your gaze this direction, <laugh>, you know? Yeah. Which is really useful because I, I think a lot of, a lot of times academics are scared to say, Hey, look at this. Because somehow it seems too common to do that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>Yeah. I guess what I'm saying is I'm, I'm quite happy to say, Hey, look at this. I am less happy to say, Hey, look at me. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1861.67" data-end_ts="1861.89" title="1861.67" id=c_"1861.67">__Oh__</span>, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>And I've, I've decided we, we just moved and we have, we have to sell the old house. But once I do that, I'm gonna start like emailing my old student, Leanne. And because she's like, Meg, you need a newsletter and you need to publicize because like, I don't know, when you have events and you like had this really cool thing that happened at school and I didn't even know that it was happening and you are a dumb ass. I'm like, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see what you're saying. Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>I'm like, well, I was so busy getting it ready and like it's, and so, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You know, I see what you're, you're saying, I see what you're saying. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1893.77" data-end_ts="1893.89" title="1893.77" id=c_"1893.77">__He__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1893.89" data-end_ts="1894.01" title="1893.89" id=c_"1893.89">__helped__</span> her. Right. I see what you're, you're saying because, for example, one of the things, I was kind of sniffing around the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1900.85" data-end_ts="1900.97" title="1900.85" id=c_"1900.85">__c__</span> a a this year. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And I see, oh, they have a meaning thing about sonic art. Well that's cool. Oh, look who's running the show, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b><laugh>. Yeah. And I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1914.37" data-end_ts="1914.45" title="1914.37" id=c_"1914.37">__did__</span> post about it on Facebook. I invited people to submit, but then went the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1918.21" data-end_ts="1918.37" title="1918.21" id=c_"1918.21">__pa__</span> like I didn't say, you know, this is happening. Once it was happening, I, I'm just terrible. Yeah. I, I very much, I live very future tense, I guess, <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's better that than others, I guess. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>I guess. So I've decided that I'm gonna like very casually write Lee <span style="color:red" data-ts="1937.27" data-end_ts="1937.49" title="1937.27" id=c_"1937.27">__Ann__</span> emails about what's going on, and then she can like package it up. I just, I don't know. I I have a block. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, I hear you. It's, it's, it could be a thing, and especially when you're having to weigh that work with doing research or doing a composition or preparing a piece, it's really hard to, hard to say, yeah, I'm gonna do a Facebook blitz 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b><laugh>. But I, I realize as well though, that the people that are good at that are going to get opportunities that I'm not, like I was lucky to be in the right place at the right time to meet the Meyer Sound people. But how nice would it have been if like my website had been up to date and like people had written about stuff that I had done. And they would, instead of having to just trust me <laugh>, I could actually look around. And so I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1992.4" data-end_ts="1992.56" title="1992.4" id=c_"1992.4">__just__</span>, I wrote a grant for the, for school to go out to to San Francisco for this thing. And so <span style="color:red" data-ts="1999.15" data-end_ts="1999.44" title="1999.15" id=c_"1999.15">__Maya__</span> wrote and said, whoa, we're gonna donate all this equipment. And the lab wrote and said, whenever that equipment is ready, we will do something. 'cause this is hella cool. And I actually made sure to put in a budget for promotion and documentation. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>'cause I'm like, this is gonna be big. Yeah. And I need to actually take advantage of it fully in a way that maybe I haven't to this point because it's been, that's, that is the hard thing for me. And it's so funny 'cause like I have all my like, composition students and I'll be like, well, this is the hard thing for you, so you really need to do it. And I'm like, ah, damnit. Like, this is the hard thing for me. Like, it sounds so stupid. I'm like, yes, I'm gonna learn all the math behind Wakefield synthesis, and yes, I'm gonna do all this in-depth research to five nodes on every first like person thing that I can find on this. But like writing and saying, Hey, come to my stuff <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. That's, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>That's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What's interesting is that that's like the least technical and that requires the least amount of so-called practice. But I think in the end, that ends up, that does end up being the hard thing for people. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>I it just depends on your personality, I guess. So that's, that's the hard thing for me and I need to, suck it up 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Yeah, indeed. So, thinking about this c a a thing makes me want to ask now, as a person coming from a very heavy duty music background, what does sound art mean to you? And how do you kind of relate the one side to the other? Because personally I teach sound and musical concepts in an art department. Mm-hmm. I'm really glad I get to do that because teaching in an art department is vastly different from the kind of students and the kind of track you see in a music program. Yes. How do you play those two and how do you go to <span style="color:red" data-ts="2119.72" data-end_ts="2119.84" title="2119.72" id=c_"2119.72">__c__</span> a a and say, Hey, I'm a musician, but we do sound and here's how it looks like and we're embracing of what you do. How, how, how do you pull that off? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>Well, I think it helps that sound art is sort of hot and trendy right now, and they're just desperate. So <laugh>, they're like, yay, somebody that sort of knows something. <laugh>. I started sort of using the term sound artist when I was getting my doctorate, I guess, because people would come to my stuff and be like, that wasn't music. And then I was working with, Charlie Woodman who was in the art department, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2159.42" data-end_ts="2159.64" title="2159.42" id=c_"2159.42">__Dar__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2159.9" data-end_ts="2160.12" title="2159.9" id=c_"2159.9">__dar__</span> Dap, DAP Dap, I think. Anyway, I can look that up and correct it later. And so the artists actually <span style="color:red" data-ts="2169.98" data-end_ts="2170.2" title="2169.98" id=c_"2169.98">__set__</span>, tended to be more forgiving and less critical. And so I found out about this term, like some people say sort of sound sculpture, or I'm a sound artist. I, I learned about Max Newhouse at the time, and he hated the term, but I was like, it actually sort of makes sense to me as a term. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>So I started calling myself a sound artist, and I sort of distanced myself from the term composer for a while. And now I've sort of returned to Composer mm-hmm. <affirmative>, because I did a lot of work researching sound art. And for me, the, the distinction I guess would be that the, the composer writes works that should be heard in a concert hall from start to finish in general. Right. And then the sound artist creates pieces that people can wander in and out of that might be in a gallery, but then there are pieces that people want you to sit in a gallery from start to finish. And there are pieces for like, Feldman has these six hour pieces and didn't expect people to stay totally attentive in the audience for the whole time. So it's always that. Great. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I, yeah, I always tend to think of, think of the difference as being one where generally, or at least one of the defining factors for me is that a composition is something that, or a composer ly composition is something that could be played by someone else. Hmm. Where often sound art has to be produced by the artist because the decision making process is too close to the surface to pass it off. I don't know. You know, I'm sure there would be some people like, Pauline I'm sure would tell me I was full of crap. And in fact, <laugh>, she's, I, I can hear her in my head already telling me I'm full of crap. But, that's Pauline and that's where she lives in my head, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b><laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>If that tells you anything about my head. But anyway. That's interesting. Now let's talk about this composition that you're working on. How, how traditional is it gonna be? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>Yeah, I don't know yet. <laugh> <laugh>. So I wrote this, very traditional violin piece, called Partita <span style="color:red" data-ts="2320.54" data-end_ts="2320.96" title="2320.54" id=c_"2320.54">__Perian__</span>, because there was, we have, so we have a doctoral of musical arts program at Stony Brook. So we have amazing players. And I had a violinist who took my computer music class and she was like, I really like this stuff, but I don't play new music. And I don't have that sort of intuitive understanding of it, but I have to program something fairly modern on my, recital because it's a, it's a requirement, right? And I like the sounds of stuff that you do, and I know you're a cellist, and so could you write me something? And I was like, yeah, interesting. And I had heard her play Bach and it was unreal. Like, the way that she was actually able to articulate the polyphony that was implied in the single line was amazing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>And so I was like, what if I could actually help her articulate that polyphony with some sort of max patch? And so I had the idea of doing this like sort of recursive stretching algorithm, and then Tom Herb wrote me a Max Patch that does it. And so each of the movements has a, has a different point at which below that threshold on, on, note level frequency, it'll start stretching out the notes. And so you Oh, sure. Okay. Shouldn't, the first movement only makes a, a single ground, and then the second movement creates chords and the third movement creates this whole crazy cloud. And that's been one of my most successful pieces. It's, it's been played everywhere. There's like two, or like two or three violinists that program it regularly. One of them is <span style="color:red" data-ts="2427.5" data-end_ts="2427.99" title="2427.5" id=c_"2427.5">__McKayla__</span> and she's down at West Virginia, and they just recorded it in a recording session that I got snowed out of, <laugh>, but it'll be, it'll be fine. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>And she has a duo with a flutist and they were like, we love this piece and we're going on tour and you should write us a violin flute piece. And I was like, I'm so busy, but I love the way that you play. And I heard her play with the flutists and you know, it's typical May, I'm like, no, I can't do it. And then two hours later I'm like, well, if I were to do it, do you guys ever do this? Because that, and like what could be kind of cool is like, I've been obsessed with this barrio piece for a while now. That's this viola, like really thorny viola thing over the top of these like recorded folk songs. And then these occasional like percussion things. And like if you could play alto flute, then you could switch lines really easily. And then I could have like one thorny line and one folks online, and then both of you can do sort of percussive effects. And so we could like add that percussive element and it would be kind of cool. And then if you each had a pedal, you would have to like cue and know that you were switching over between like, but it could be cool. And they're like, yeah, that sounds good. I'm like, oh, damnit, what did I just 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Get myself into? Because 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>I was like, no, I can't do it. And then of course I'm just sitting there and the wheels are turning and I'm like, oh, it would be good though. <laugh>. Right. And then, so at NAMM I saw the new air turn pedals and they're like, tiny and it's gonna be good. I usually hate pedals, but I'm like, I can't think of any way to do this without pedals. Right. So each of them, it's gonna have a pedal that will switch the processing. So the thorny, new music line is going to have some sort of harmonizer thing. And I'm thinking that like the noisiness of the signal will make the crunchier chord sort of thing. 'cause I wanted the flute to be able to play double stops basically 'cause they can't. Right. And then, the flute, the folk sort of line, I'm trying to figure out how to have like a knob to turn up the Bulgarian women's choir effect. <laugh>, I talking to Miller about this, I'm like, how would you, how'd you make a Bulgarian women's choir? Hetero knob. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh man. Alright. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>So, so they'll, there'll probably be some Facebook posts about that soon. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Yeah. Really. Well, just when you yeah. When you, when you start figuring out the math of that, you have to make sure that you let everyone know. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b><laugh>. So, but I think it'd be amazing. And I also have to figure out sort of what character that I can get from the violin or flute that would be a, a, a control for that. So I really like leaving room for the performers to know exactly how they're controlling it and be, have it be just an extension of their instrument instead of this is gonna happen. I want it to be under their control. And so they'll each have a one half of the two button pedal for each of them will be the thing that flips them over Right. To the other one. And I'm trying to figure out if there also could be a way that it cross fade and whether there could be something that I'm measuring that then would <span style="color:red" data-ts="2633.55" data-end_ts="2633.75" title="2633.55" id=c_"2633.55">__term__</span> determine how quickly the, the, the sounds cross fade. But it might just be immediate. I have to figure that out. And then the other pedal would be like, stomp on the pedal, play something percussive, and you get like a big boom like chaka thing. <laugh>. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Boom. Chaka. The important part of every composition 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>Is the boom. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2654.04" data-end_ts="2654.39" title="2654.04" id=c_"2654.04">__Chaka__</span> is 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The boom <span style="color:red" data-ts="2655" data-end_ts="2655.35" title="2655" id=c_"2655">__chaka__</span>. All right. Well we're, we're getting to the end of the road here, but, so normally when I interview people for the first time, the big question is tell me about your background and how you got to be the artist you are. Since we are in the February revisiting mode mm-hmm. <affirmative>, I don't have to do that because we've already done that with you, but I want to try, I want to do something different, which is, I wanna say it's 15 years from now <laugh>. When it's February and I'm doing my Meg <span style="color:red" data-ts="2690.11" data-end_ts="2690.4" title="2690.11" id=c_"2690.11">__Shel__</span> <laugh> revisited it again podcast. Where are you gonna be? Where do, where do you see yourself going over that over a longer period of time? Because it's really easy to say, well, I have just kind of set the plate for all the things I'm gonna do in the next six months or even 18 months. Yeah. But where, where do you see the, the big vector? Where, where is all of this gonna take you in the long run future? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>Yeah. So that's exactly the, the thing that I was sitting at <span style="color:red" data-ts="2723.93" data-end_ts="2724.28" title="2723.93" id=c_"2723.93">__Simat__</span> trying to figure out because, I've discovered that I'm a, an appallingly good administrator, and I was like, oh, maybe I'll be dean or provost and I'll be able to, you know, chart the direction of Stony Brook. And even, SUNY as a whole has been sort of knocking at my door a little bit because I did this massive open online course and they're like, oh, you're so fantastic at that. And not to be like, I'm amazing at everything, but I, I have a student who's similar to me where we're actually incredibly incompetent and we've just figured out systems <laugh>. And so I'm like, Taylor, I swear like when you're 36 you are gonna come into your own, my friend. Because all these other people that were able to tie their shoe laces without an 18 point plan of how to tie their shoe laces are gonna be stymied when it comes to a 50 point plan. Right. But because you and I have always needed to like write out the 18 points to do our laundry or like leave the house or pay a bill, we're actually ahead of the game. <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Margaret: </b>And the fact that we have to write everything down, we'll actually come in handy because we won't be counting on our memory, we'll be counting on our notes. And we've figured out how to do that really well. And so I was like, do I want, I, I don't think I wanna be president of a university because that seems like a lot of fundraising goes into it. But wow, you know, it could be cool to be dean. And then I was sitting at cinema and I was like, f that f helping everybody with <span style="color:red" data-ts="2827.59" data-end_ts="2827.83" title="2827.59" id=c_"2827.59">__what__</span> I do. <laugh>, I wanna help the weirdos. I wanna help the people that are in between art and science and in between music and art and in between, you know, human computer interaction and not being able to interact with humans. <laugh>. Right. And I really wanna run a place like <span style="color:red" data-ts="2846.33" data-end_ts="2846.55" title="2846.33" id=c_"2846.33">__Sin__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2846.55" data-end_ts="2846.75" title="2846.55" id=c_"2846.55">__Mat__</span>. I don't know whether it would be bounded as closely to music. I do know that bounds are helpful. But I wanna have a, a place that has a kitchen and a backyard and a, a space that can have lectures and concerts and hangouts and has awesome people there from multiple disciplines conversing on a really respectful and deep level and making cool stuff.

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Okay, well I'm gonna have to just put right down here that that actually works, <laugh>, because there's enough, a lot of other things I've said that haven't worked at all so much.

<b>Darwin: </b>Many thanks to Meg for spending the time talking to us again. Always interesting to talk to her, find out what she's doing, and also find out what's happening in her neck of the woods. There's, she's just <span style="color:red" data-ts="2972.12" data-end_ts="2972.32" title="2972.12" id=c_"2972.12">__is__</span> kind of tapped into everything, so it's really cool to check it out. So, with that, I want to thank you again for listening, and make sure you tell your friends, family, coworkers, whatever, to, tune in on our little podcast. It's really exciting to see it continue to grow. Next week is number 74. Those of you know me know that that means something a little bit special. So, until then, I want to thank you for your listenership and we'll catch you next week.
