<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. This week I have the, the pleasure of introducing you, to somebody that, came onto the, onto my radar, a while ago when he put together a really interesting little max patch that kind of provided a way to have the computer interact with my modular system. It was really interesting and pretty exciting. Since then, he's done a bunch of other work. I'll let him explain it. He's in Brazil. I'm going to butcher his name right now, and then we'll go from there. So I, I'm gonna say that it's, <span style="color:red" data-ts="44.435" data-end_ts="44.555" title="44.435" id=c_"44.435">__I__</span>, is that anywhere close? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro Ferre: </b><laugh>? Well, it's kind of close <laugh>. It's <span style="color:red" data-ts="50.855" data-end_ts="51.075" title="50.855" id=c_"50.855">__efe__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, <span style="color:red" data-ts="52.105" data-end_ts="52.395" title="52.105" id=c_"52.105">__Faye__</span>. All right. Why don't you start off by, talking a little bit about your work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="60.215" data-end_ts="60.435" title="60.215" id=c_"60.215">__All__</span> right. Nowadays I have a, I have a web company called Spectral Audio, and I make a couple of Macs for live devices and one standalone app, which is CB two Kit, which is the one you were talking about. Right. And I do a lot of music stuff here in Brazil, but most of my day I spend working on the spectral audio stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Now you're also doing a Max for <span style="color:red" data-ts="83.115" data-end_ts="83.355" title="83.115" id=c_"83.115">__Life__</span> thing, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Yeah, that's actually how I got started in Max. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see. Oh, interesting. Why don't we right away give people the, the URL for that, so <span style="color:red" data-ts="94.635" data-end_ts="94.755" title="94.635" id=c_"94.635">__you__</span> can go check it out. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Cool. It's, it's Spectral audio, so S-B-E-K-T-R-O audio.com. Okay, great. And you can find all of the stuff there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Fantastic. First of all, what kind of, what kind of setup do you have that got you interested in doing an, an interaction between MAX and modular? Do you have a big modular system or a tiny one, or, <span style="color:red" data-ts="117.455" data-end_ts="117.675" title="117.455" id=c_"117.455">__and__</span>, what kind of stuff do you have in it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>All right. Nowadays I have a 12 U Eurorack system. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>But I got started with actually four modules, <laugh>, which were the ES three, the expert sleepers, ES three. Right. The Z 3000, the Tiptop audio oscillator. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yep. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Mark two, and two, I can't remember. It was like a dual VCA and a filter. I think they were dark <span style="color:red" data-ts="144.435" data-end_ts="144.635" title="144.435" id=c_"144.435">__for__</span> something. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. <span style="color:red" data-ts="146.375" data-end_ts="146.595" title="146.375" id=c_"146.375">__All__</span> right. Cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>And that was like about three years ago, but nowadays I have this 12 u and I, I have basically two six U cases. Okay. One of them is the one that I take to play live, and the other one that I have, it consists only of Brazilian modules. So I have the EMW modules. Right. And I have another brand called <span style="color:red" data-ts="169.365" data-end_ts="169.585" title="169.365" id=c_"169.365">__the__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="169.705" data-end_ts="169.825" title="169.705" id=c_"169.705">__v__</span> Brazil Systems. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="171.285" data-end_ts="171.505" title="171.285" id=c_"171.285">__Oh__</span>, I've not heard of that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Yeah. It's basically just one guy who's from Rio Janero. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And he has been making these modules for quite a long time, actually around like, I think he started like back in 2008 or something. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Wow. That's interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Yeah, he makes a couple of like red panels. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see. Oh, very nice. So you actually, you actually use your modular for performing then? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Yeah, I do a lot actually. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, do you also take, do you also take a computer out with you or are you doing just modular stuff? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Nowadays I have basically two music projects. Okay. I have one that I play live, which I just improvise. And then I, I take my computer and the <span style="color:red" data-ts="218.705" data-end_ts="218.925" title="218.705" id=c_"218.705">__Aon__</span> push a couple of media controllers in the modular Uhhuh 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>And then I have another one that I play with two other friends of mine, and we play more like dense music, more like dance floor related music. Right, right. So Future House and EDM, all that <span style="color:red" data-ts="231.965" data-end_ts="232.085" title="231.965" id=c_"231.965">__kinda__</span> stuff. Sure. And then, yeah, I use the computer together with the modular in both cases. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, where in Brazil are you located? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>I'm about like an hour and away, an hour and a half away from Sao Paulo City. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, okay. Alright. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>But in the states of Sao Paulo. I got 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It. Cool. So what's the scene like there? What is, what's the music scene and what's the music technology scene like? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>It's basically none existing 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Oh, really? <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Yeah, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So you own the place, right? <laugh>? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Well, that, that's the thing. Like we have a really special group here in Brazil. We have a, a group on Facebook, which is called the Modular <span style="color:red" data-ts="271.505" data-end_ts="271.725" title="271.505" id=c_"271.505">__vr__</span>. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And that's where we talk about this kind of stuff because we don't have a lot of people here that own modulars or that have access to that kind of stuff. Right. Or even know about them. So the ones who do we always get to, and we have these meetings like twice a year, that's when we get together and talk about this kind of stuff and show each other what we have and let other people play with our stuff, you know, so we can spread the word about it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="299.805" data-end_ts="299.925" title="299.805" id=c_"299.805">__kinda__</span> interesting to me that you say there aren't a lot of people with modulars because, EMW is is actually a pretty incredible company with a really wide range of modules. Yep. And, I'm surprised that that wasn't built off of a, like a bigger modular community in Brazil. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>No, not really. The thing is, I know <span style="color:red" data-ts="322.295" data-end_ts="322.645" title="322.295" id=c_"322.295">__Paolo__</span>, which is the owner of EMW, and I've <span style="color:red" data-ts="325.125" data-end_ts="325.285" title="325.125" id=c_"325.125">__taught__</span>, I went to their factory a couple of months ago, actually. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And the thing is, he was a <span style="color:red" data-ts="330.805" data-end_ts="331.005" title="330.805" id=c_"330.805">__safe__</span> addict. So <laugh>, that's why he got started with the modular stuff. He had like a, I think he even had like an ARP 2,500. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh my goodness. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Yeah. He had like a lot of stuff. So that's why he got started with the EMW. But there, there aren't a lot of people here who actually own modular systems. That's starting to change, like very slowly Uhhuh. But because of our important taxes, we can't really get a lot of the modules that you guys have in the States or in Europe. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="361.765" data-end_ts="361.965" title="361.765" id=c_"361.765">__Because__</span> they would, like, if you try to like order something and get them delivered here, you end up paying something around like a hundred to 110% in Texas, which is crazy. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh my goodness. Well, it probably makes it so that when you do get a module imported, it feels pretty special. So <laugh> Oh, yeah. I'm curious with, with sort of a small and tight-knit group. What, what got you into, what got you into electronic music production in the first place and then, eventually led you into programming and doing the CV toolkit and some of this other work? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Right. So I, I got started with the electronic music, when I was 14, and I started as a dj. So I would play like in small parties. That was around like 2004 or something. And then like a couple of years later, like three or four years later, I got interested in actually making music. So that's when I discovered like Ableton and Logic, Uhhuh, <affirmative> and Foodie Loops even back then. Oh, sure. So I started like playing around with them and trying to see if I could come up with something. I had no music background or anything. It was just a matter of having access to that kind of stuff to the software itself. And then just playing with it, see if I could come up with something. Sure, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>And then around 2011, I think it was like July, 2011, I went to LA and I, I went to SAE. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, okay. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>So I took their audio technology program, that was like for about 10 months or so. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I came back to Brazil. I worked at a post-production facility for about a year, which were located in Sao Paulo City. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And that was a big of a, that was kind of a problem for me because like about a year later, I had to quit because I had to basically drive three hours a day. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>So that was wasn't working, working out for me. Right. So that's when I, I had to, that was around 2013 or so. And then instead of trying to get a job somewhere else, I decided to try to come <span style="color:red" data-ts="499.285" data-end_ts="499.485" title="499.285" id=c_"499.285">__up__</span> with my own company. Right. And that's when I started Spectral Audio. And my initial goal was to actually make music for like advertisement and stuff and something like that, Uhhuh <affirmative>. But for some reason, and I can't remember why, I think it was around the time that Ableton Live Nine came out. Right. It included Max for live Uhhuh <affirmative> <span style="color:red" data-ts="521.525" data-end_ts="521.725" title="521.525" id=c_"521.525">__in__</span> the, in the <span style="color:red" data-ts="523.285" data-end_ts="523.485" title="523.285" id=c_"523.285">__suit__</span> version, which <span style="color:red" data-ts="524.125" data-end_ts="524.325" title="524.125" id=c_"524.125">__is__</span> the one I have. So I went to max four live.com, and I downloaded a couple of batches and I remember I downloaded one of the, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="534.165" data-end_ts="534.365" title="534.165" id=c_"534.165">__firm__</span> as rotating Clock Divider clone. Right. I think I tried it for a couple of minutes and it wasn't really working out the way I wanted. So I've opened up the Max Batch. I was like, I think I can fix this and make it work exactly the way I want. So I give it a try. And I managed to do the mods that I wanted to do, and that's how I got started with MaxMSP. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. Wow. So that <span style="color:red" data-ts="560.205" data-end_ts="560.445" title="560.205" id=c_"560.205">__kind__</span> of, that kind of hooked you just in order to try and, get something that worked the way you wanted. It's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Interesting. Yeah. Basically that was basically it. Yeah. Then did you have 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Any background in programming at all before that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Not at all. So I made that one the clone, and then I had the ES three. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>And I wanted to make something that could work with my modular synth, because back then I had, I didn't even have like a MIDI two CV converter or anything. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So I wanted to see if I could make something that would work the way I wanted and communicate with the modular synth. So yeah. So I made a couple of Max four <span style="color:red" data-ts="595.525" data-end_ts="595.725" title="595.525" id=c_"595.525">__Life__</span> devices that were, that generated cv, Uhhuh <affirmative>. The next thing was I wanted to, because of the, the way Max four <span style="color:red" data-ts="603.965" data-end_ts="604.125" title="603.965" id=c_"603.965">__Life__</span> Works, you can only output two channels at a time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Which was really quite limiting for me. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>So I decided to make a standalone application that could access all the eight outputs of the ES three. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>That's the story behind CV two Kid. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Got it. So you have some CV devices <span style="color:red" data-ts="624.185" data-end_ts="624.405" title="624.185" id=c_"624.185">__for__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="624.425" data-end_ts="624.645" title="624.425" id=c_"624.425">__Max__</span> for Life. Are those, do you just have it so that those are limited to the two outputs and you just live with that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Yeah, that's basically it because mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I tried to like come up with workarounds, but the problem was all of them included a little bit of latency. Yeah. A little bit more than I wanted. So Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Your CV toolkit and some of the devices you actually do things, you implement things like LFOs and sort of like continuous stuff. So it'd be one thing if it was, if it was purely just events or something that wasn't quite so time critical. But because you do both, rhythmic generators as well as like time synchronized, LFOs and stuff, you're, you're probably wanting to be really tight on the timing of that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Once I decided to make a standalone version of CCB two Kid, I noticed that I could actually use it with any other doll, not only Ableton Live. So I could basically have it open side by side with any other doll 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Of course. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>And then <span style="color:red" data-ts="686.235" data-end_ts="686.525" title="686.235" id=c_"686.235">__sync__</span> it via <span style="color:red" data-ts="686.915" data-end_ts="687.205" title="686.915" id=c_"686.915">__MIDI__</span> and have it worked that way. Right. So that was <span style="color:red" data-ts="690.805" data-end_ts="691.005" title="690.805" id=c_"690.805">__one__</span> another benefit of having it as a standalone app. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That's that's a great point. When you started doing this stuff, is this when you had like the four modules system and then you just kept on getting bigger from there? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>By the time I made the first standalone version, I had like a couple of, I had like eight or nine modules. I had the WMD Geiger Counter and Maths obviously. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. The one module that everybody owns <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Oh yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. But it's, oh. Yeah. The reason I ask that is because one of the things I love about the CV toolkit is it's a way to sort of like test drive a lot of different kind of modulators without having to either have the Rackspace or the money necessary to get all those modules. It's a great way, if you've got an ES three, it's a great way to experiment with a lot of different kinds of modules. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Oh yeah. That, and that was my intention because I didn't have access to a lot of modules. So I had to basically come up with a way to generate this all kinds of CV modulations that I wanted without actually having to buy more modules. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. And did you, like, for yourself, did you use it then to do things like, say, well, you know what, I I do use an LFO on every project, so I'm gonna, I'm gonna now, move into owning hardware. Or do you, or do you still pretty much, stay focused on using the CV toolkit type program for a lot of that kind of functionality? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="785.985" data-end_ts="786.205" title="785.985" id=c_"785.985">__Mm__</span>. It depends. If I want like time synced LFOs, you know, like quarter notes or half notes, then I use CV two kids. Sure. But if not, I just use this stuff that I have here. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I, the reason I ask that is because I know for my, for my own self, sometimes it can be, sometimes I, I want to work away from the computer. 'cause when I work with the computer, I do certain kinds of work. And then if I'm not looking at a computer, I do a completely different kind of kinda work. And sometimes Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I prefer that away from the computer thing. And I was wondering, how you personally find it integrating the computer and the, I mean, certainly working with the CB toolkit standalone is different than working with a daw. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Oh, yeah. And that, that's, that was one of my goals. I wanted to make something that was easy to use and easy to set up. And nowadays I use CB two <span style="color:red" data-ts="844.685" data-end_ts="844.845" title="844.685" id=c_"844.685">__kit__</span> a lot when I want to make, polyon and Parafon patches. Sure. 'cause that was one thing that I always wanted to do with my modular system. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And so then one of the things you need to have is your modular has to be kind of heavy on oscillators and stuff so 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>You can Oh, yeah. And envelopes and VCAs. Yeah. Yeah. It's not a perfect polyphonic synth. Right. 'cause I have like different, different envelopes and different VCAs. So each voice end up sounding a little bit different. Right. But that's cool. I think it's cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's part of the fun, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Oh yeah, definitely. So that's one of the things that CB two allows you to do is calibrate different oscillators and play them polyphonically and all that kind of stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I've just started playing with it a little bit and I'm, I'm pretty fascinated because in fact it is a different way of interacting with the computer. 'cause certainly unlike doing automations or something in, in, Ableton Live, it is sort of more like working with the modular and that you set things up and then you kind of build up this generative kind of system, or at least that's how I find I use it. Is it, it it sort of like extends the range of doing that kind of work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Yeah. I think that's cool. I, I'm glad you're using it that way. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So for yourself, when you, when you use it, or when you do a gig where you're doing sort of like solo work, what are the kinds of things that you do that represent your core performance techniques? What are the things that are kind of like your s your secret sauce? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>When I'm playing my, my live set that I basically improvise everything. I have the able <span style="color:red" data-ts="949.995" data-end_ts="950.285" title="949.995" id=c_"949.995">__push__</span> doing the drums, taking care of all that kind of stuff. Sure. And then I usually have two or three voices going around the modular. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>So I usually have like a bass voice and then something like in their badge or something. And then I, I usually have a high <span style="color:red" data-ts="970.715" data-end_ts="970.935" title="970.715" id=c_"970.715">__hat__</span> voice that I make. Okay. So I play around with the decay and all that kind of stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So that's what you do to kinda like add variation to the drum sounds then? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Yeah. Right. And I try to experiment. I've tried like running stuff through the modular, I dunno, it didn't work out for me. I would much rather use the modular as a by itself, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. As a voice. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Yeah. And nowadays I only use digital oscillators. Oh really? When I'm playing live. Really? Yeah. It's just because of the tuning. Oh, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1001.535" data-end_ts="1001.775" title="1001.535" id=c_"1001.535">__sure__</span>. I find them that they, they keep the tuning while I'm playing, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. That's actually a really good point, because that, that is one of the things that can be frustrating sometimes. Oh, yeah. Playing live is, is tuning. And especially when, a lot of times for me, I like, like grabbing the frequency now, but an oscillator and moving it around and Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, and using that as kind of a performance technique, but then all of a sudden you'll, you'll do the next thing and it's like, you expect it to be in tune and it's like, oh, crap. You know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b><laugh>. Yeah. It's hard. Like, it's gone. It's easy just to take it outta tune, but it's really hard to, really hard to put it back in tune. Yeah, exactly. While you, you're playing live. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Right. And I, I try, like, I tried Cyrus <span style="color:red" data-ts="1046.625" data-end_ts="1046.975" title="1046.625" id=c_"1046.625">__Trick__</span>, Cyrus Rex Uhhuh tricks that he basically records the raw sound of the oscillators into able <span style="color:red" data-ts="1053.815" data-end_ts="1054.055" title="1053.815" id=c_"1053.815">__tune__</span> and then plays them through the ees <span style="color:red" data-ts="1055.415" data-end_ts="1055.575" title="1055.415" id=c_"1055.415">__tree__</span>. So you're not actually using the oscillators live. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>But then you're sending through the filters and all that. And that's okay. But, I don't know. It's, it's not the same. You know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>I, because I really, I use the braids live and I like, like using different modes and Oh, right. I also have, an E two 50, the morphine terrarium. And I use that live as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, you said you have a geer counter? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>I don't anymore terra. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, you don't? And I really 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Regret selling you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Yeah. That's, that is a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1090.145" data-end_ts="1090.365" title="1090.145" id=c_"1090.145">__ma__</span> That's a magical, I actually have the guitar pedal version of it. Oh, cool. 'cause I like using it with other instrumentation or with like a recorder as well. But I just find that that thing just does kind of magic sometimes. It's pretty interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Yeah, it's really fun. I just got a new module and I'm having a lot of fun with it. Uhhuh <affirmative>, and it's a Brazilian one, actually. It's the Vil. It's called the Lizard two, and people can find it at vil. It's vil systems.com. And it's a really crazy module. It's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1122.485" data-end_ts="1122.605" title="1122.485" id=c_"1122.485">__a__</span> hybrid of a sequencer <span style="color:red" data-ts="1124.525" data-end_ts="1124.685" title="1124.525" id=c_"1124.525">__and__</span> an oscillator. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, that sounds crazy. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>And, yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So basically, so you can kinda like dial in the waveform. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Yeah, exactly. So it's, it's a, it's a sequencer, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1134.665" data-end_ts="1134.885" title="1134.665" id=c_"1134.665">__an__</span> eight step sequencer. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But the thing is, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1136.905" data-end_ts="1137.125" title="1136.905" id=c_"1136.905">__is__</span> it tracks one volt per ve. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>So if you set it to sequencer, the, the internal oscillator goes from like zero to, I don't know, like 10 hertz or whatever. But if you set it to VCO mode, then it goes up to 10,000 hertz or something. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Wow. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Oh wow. And it tracks <span style="color:red" data-ts="1154.845" data-end_ts="1154.965" title="1154.845" id=c_"1154.845">__one__</span> proactive, so you can actually play it, and then the steps become the, the parts of the waveform. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The waveform. Sure. That's, that's awesome. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>And it has eight inputs that it also includes a part that it's basically a sequential switcher. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So you can also switch between the, all the eight inputs. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, interesting. That's really 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Cool. Yeah, it's really cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's neat. I have to check that out. I, I have to admit, I, I thought I'd heard of everything, but the Brazil systems is a new one for me. I'm gonna have to check that out. Yeah. Do they, do they export stuff? I would assume so, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Yeah. It's, well, it's just one guy. <laugh>. Yeah. Right. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So if he, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>But you can order <span style="color:red" data-ts="1193.765" data-end_ts="1193.925" title="1193.765" id=c_"1193.765">__them__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>If he feels like going to the post office, we're good. <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b><laugh>. Well, if you talk to him, he can make something for you. It's just that he doesn't make a lot of modules and, you know, he doesn't have a way to make too many units to mass 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>At once. Mass. Yeah. Manufacture 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>'em to mass produce them. So he makes them by order. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Got it. Got it. Well, it's funny because like, EMW, it's, I mean, their range of stuff that they have, it almost competes with something like Defer. But until very recently, it was almost impossible to get here in the US just recently. Perfect Circuit out in, California, started carrying their stuff, which is really great because all of a sudden now people are like, oh wow, check it out. They've got like six different LFOs. Let's, you know, see what they're like. And that's kind of a neat new, modular maker. Is there anyone else in Brazil right now that's doing anything? Other than these two, these two groups? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>We have one guy here, which everybody knows him around here. His name is Artur. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1256.525" data-end_ts="1256.725" title="1256.525" id=c_"1256.525">__<inaudible>__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Uhhuh. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>And he doesn't create stuff from scratch, but he usually builds systems using the music from outer space, PCBs. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>And he makes like those huge five U systems. But that's basically it. We don't have a lot of people here creating stuff from scratch. Uhhuh, <affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's, it's curious. 'cause one of the things that, like I, my friend Chris <span style="color:red" data-ts="1285.335" data-end_ts="1285.685" title="1285.335" id=c_"1285.335">__Larky__</span> who, runs an instruments company, one of the things that he does a lot is taking just a variety of, I mean, he's kinda like a hardware hacker guy, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And he takes a lot of different hardware and like squeezes them into Euro format. And I was just wondering if there, if you have anyone there that does that kind of stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Yeah, we do have like a, a DIY scene here. It's not huge, but you don't see like many people going out from those DIY groups and actually making a product. Right. I see that they can sell to other people. You know, it's usually like people just go online and they find a, design that they wanna make uhhuh, and then they print <span style="color:red" data-ts="1328.165" data-end_ts="1328.325" title="1328.165" id=c_"1328.165">__the__</span> board and they do, but they do the, they do it for themselves, basically. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see. Okay. Yeah. 'cause that was the other thing I was gonna ask. In, in a place where it's that expensive to get stuff. What is the DIY world? Like? Can you say it's active, but individual? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Yeah, basically Uhhuh. <affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. I wanna talk a little bit more about your background, because it sounds like before you got into modulars, and certainly before you got into programming, you were really a, a music. And if you went to SAE you were a recording head. Yeah. What, how did you get started with that? I mean, if you go all the way back, I mean, what was, what was your background? Did you, you know, were, did you come from a musical family? Did you, did you do a lot of things musically as a kid? What, what got you on that path? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>I think it was technology. Actually. My family has nothing to do with music and I don't have any relatives that, that do anything related to music. But, I was always really into computer stuff. And by the time I was 14, as I said, I, I started DJing and one thing <span style="color:red" data-ts="1402.285" data-end_ts="1402.485" title="1402.285" id=c_"1402.285">__led__</span> to another, you know, and next thing I know, I was trying to make music on the computer and trying to record stuff. But I would say I'm more of a technology person than a music person, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I see. Okay. Other than DJing, what were some of your earlier, what were some of your earlier recording experiences? I mean, did you, was it just one of those things that was natural that you were, you were doing DJing and you were like, well, this is cool and I'm gonna, I can get some software and start doing some of this myself. Or were you working with other people, or did you, you know, I like for myself, I got started in a really weird way. I was, you know, I would go to church and I got bored and they had a recording system there. And so I started helping out, you know, and it kind of out of left field, I got into this interest. I would've never thought I was gonna make a living at it, but it was really kind of cool that I could. Right. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, what were the things that were sort of like the first, your first sort of recording gigs or your first recording opportunities? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Well, the thing is, the place, the city I lived here in Brazil, there weren't a lot of people that were doing that kind of stuff back in 2008, 2007. Okay. Even earlier 2005 and six. So I didn't, I didn't have anyone that had the equipment that I needed, nor did I knew anyone that was interested in that kind of stuff. Uhhuh. But I had the internet so I could go to YouTube and I could search for anything that I wanted. So that's what I did. Sure. Okay. And then the, I think the, at some point I bought a, a fast track <span style="color:red" data-ts="1509.085" data-end_ts="1509.285" title="1509.085" id=c_"1509.085">__and__</span> audio fast track interface. Ah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>There you go. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Yeah. And then I bought like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1514.485" data-end_ts="1514.725" title="1514.485" id=c_"1514.485">__media__</span> controller. And that's how I got started, because 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I was gonna say, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1517.745" data-end_ts="1517.965" title="1517.745" id=c_"1517.745">__And__</span> then I started, like, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It was, it, it had to be something like that because you don't pick up and go to LA Blind saying, well, I think I'm like 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Recording. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1525.845" data-end_ts="1526.045" title="1525.845" id=c_"1525.845">__Oh__</span>, no, no, no. <laugh>. Well, I bought the interface then I, I would do like the, what everybody would do, which is call like a, a couple of friends to come over and record some stuff. Right. And we would never actually end up mixing and mastering anything. We'd just do it for fun, you know? Sure. And yeah, it went from there basically. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So now that you have both, like the experience of the recording school and, and also the experience of performing now and developing the software and stuff, what are the things that interest you most? What are you into now? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Well I'm really into modular, the modular system, as I said, I have quite a large system nowadays. Right, right. And I try to use it and I try to play it as an instrument. It's something that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1572.765" data-end_ts="1572.885" title="1572.765" id=c_"1572.765">__I__</span>, I'm always trying to improve upon and trying to come up with different ways to play it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Do you, do you practice? I'm always curious with people. 'cause like for me, with the modular system, I try and sit down for some period of time every day and just practice. And sometimes practice looks like I'm gonna try all the different ways of modulating an envelope. And sometimes it's like, I'm just gonna try a way to make, find a way to make a beautiful melody <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Yeah. Try to do that. Like, if possible every day. Because the thing is, I don't have any like, performing module. I don't have like a pressure points or anything like that. Right. I have a se I have the metropolis, which is the sequencer. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>But I don't have a way to actually, it's not an expressive system, you know, but I always try to see if I can come up with different ways that I can make different sounds or try to use modules in different ways. So for example, another day I was trying to use two oscillators in the make noise function as a track and hold circuit. Right. So I could like use one oscillator to hold the other waveform, you know? Sure. And try to create different sounds that way. Yeah. So the modular is one thing that I'm really into nowadays. Also, I also bought a couple of Arduinos a couple of months ago. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I've been working on some custom media controllers for my live performance. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>So yeah, that's, I'm trying to learn a little bit more <span style="color:red" data-ts="1660.405" data-end_ts="1660.565" title="1660.405" id=c_"1660.405">__about__</span> electronics. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. I'm gonna have to trick you into trying out the art <span style="color:red" data-ts="1664.805" data-end_ts="1665.085" title="1664.805" id=c_"1664.805">__core__</span> stuff because, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Oh yeah, I've always wanted that one. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's, snazzy Effects actually does the module. And so I don't anything to do with that. But, you know, I kind of support the DIY community behind it. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And it's actually really interesting because it, in a way, it's a similar thing to what you did with the CV toolkit. Similar, but different in that it allows you to experiment with a lot of different kinds of modulation systems to see what you like. You know, so you can try a clock divider, and if that doesn't work for you, you can try a clock multiplier. And if that doesn't work for you, you can try a something else. You know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Yeah. I really like that kind of modules. Yeah. There's another one, the, the REBO Technologies one, hold on. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The Owl. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Yeah. Which don't, it's the one that you can program. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, yeah, yeah. That uses a little lower, that's a little heavier duty thing, but I think you can, with that, you can actually do like, you can actually do oscillators and stuff where the ARD core, because of the, kind of the limitations of the, of the Arduino, Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> are sort of like limited the control voltage manipulation and, and creating modulators. Right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> modulators. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> or Pulse. Pulse train. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Yeah. One of the reasons why I got the ar doing <span style="color:red" data-ts="1743.165" data-end_ts="1743.325" title="1743.165" id=c_"1743.165">__it__</span> in the first place was because I have a TR 6 0 6 that I wanted to sync with Ableton. That thing only has a din <span style="color:red" data-ts="1750.085" data-end_ts="1750.365" title="1750.085" id=c_"1750.085">__sync__</span> port. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>So I bought an Arduino so I could make a, a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1754.845" data-end_ts="1755.045" title="1754.845" id=c_"1754.845">__mini__</span> clock to <span style="color:red" data-ts="1755.885" data-end_ts="1756.165" title="1755.885" id=c_"1755.885">__<inaudible>__</span> converter. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> just working fine now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. It is rebel technology that, does the owl. Interesting. I didn't realize that that was who did it? I just, I had heard of it. I just didn't know who ran that project. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Yeah. Pretty neat stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It <span style="color:red" data-ts="1773.605" data-end_ts="1773.685" title="1773.605" id=c_"1773.605">__looked__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>It looks really cool. And I really like this idea of like having a, a module that you can program and use like the knobs and the inputs and output of the module, but you can come up with your own code for the module to use. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, I know for myself using the, the art <span style="color:red" data-ts="1792.085" data-end_ts="1792.325" title="1792.085" id=c_"1792.085">__core__</span> thing, I am, you know, it took me, I experimented for like a year and a half before I finally ended up coming up with the sketch in the module that I use all the time. But it's like this weird thing where it's like it can record control voltages, but then I have two knobs that are like the start and the end of the loop. Oh, cool. And then I can like, do moving loops throughout this CV kind of, stuff. This recorded CV loop. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And it's a really neat way because in performance, one of the things that I certainly have trouble with in performance is doing things on the modular that don't become so repetitive that they become boring. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Oh yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So I'm always looking for ways not only modulating the voice, but actually modulating the sequence and stuff like that. And so I play around with that a lot and, and that's what that sketch in the hardcore ends up being really useful for. I can set up this like 64 <span style="color:red" data-ts="1850.765" data-end_ts="1851.085" title="1850.765" id=c_"1850.765">__steps__</span> sequence, but just pick little eight or 12 note or even four <span style="color:red" data-ts="1855.965" data-end_ts="1856.245" title="1855.965" id=c_"1855.965">__note__</span> segments of it and just repeat those and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1858.965" data-end_ts="1859.085" title="1858.965" id=c_"1858.965">__then__</span> kind of move it around. It gives me a lot of variation in performance that I don't get when I'm normally, you know, when I'm working with a standard sequencer. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Yeah, sure. I have one thing that I use for that kind of stuff Yeah. Is the LSS one lights strip. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, yeah. But how do you use that to vary up a sequence? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>That's the thing. I have it going to an A 1 51 Quad <span style="color:red" data-ts="1886.345" data-end_ts="1886.565" title="1886.345" id=c_"1886.345">__se__</span>, the switcher. Yeah. Yeah. And then I have four different destinations, and then I made a max batch that basically alternates between these different outputs. It basically controls the AFI 1 51. Right. <laugh>. So like if I want to like, choose the third output, it sends a reset signal, reset trigger, then three three, then pumps 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It three. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Yeah. It's a really hacky way to do it, but it works for me. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's great. That's actually a good point. I, those, those switching modules always, they, I get 'em and I'm like, oh man, there's like 50 things I could do with them and then I get 'em and I don't ever plug 'em in. But that's actually a really great use for a switcher module. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Yeah. It basically becomes like a controllable switcher instead of just a sequential switcher. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. That's, that's really smart. What other tricks do you use to keep things spicy during a, during a performance? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Because I'll tell you, I, I sometimes go to performances by people with modular systems and they can be incredibly boring because the person who's doing it is having a lot of fun patching in real time. But I'm like, you know, kinda looking at my watch saying, well, it's been like 14 minutes since the last change. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b><laugh>. Yeah. I know. Well, the thing is, when I perform live, I usually play house music uhhuh, and I usually play like acid house and that kind of stuff. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>And I try to have the modular, like right in front of the stage and like, as it as a main piece of the, of my setup. Right. And I usually make baselines and all that kind of stuff in it. So by having modules such as the braids and the E <span style="color:red" data-ts="1990.085" data-end_ts="1990.245" title="1990.085" id=c_"1990.085">__three__</span> 50 and even the tides, the mutal instrument tides. Right. I use it a lot as a oscillator. Oh, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Do you? Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>They have, they have so many different modes that by just using these different modes, you can get a lot of variation. The other thing that I do is I use a lot of switches, as I said. Mm-Hmm. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2007.725" data-end_ts="2007.765" title="2007.725" id=c_"2007.725">__<affirmative>__</span>, I have a, I also have a molecular switch, which is different from the A 1 51. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. 'cause it doesn't latch, right. It's either, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Yeah, it's momentary, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But it's cool 'cause you can use it to like, for example, I have an o <span style="color:red" data-ts="2022.535" data-end_ts="2022.885" title="2022.535" id=c_"2022.535">__later__</span> here in my other case, which has two sub outputs. So I usually take like the sign and the saw tooth and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2030.645" data-end_ts="2030.805" title="2030.645" id=c_"2030.645">__then__</span> plug them into the A and b inputs of the switch. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And then I use a s output to switch between those two. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, nice. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>So you can create different waveforms <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's pretty cool. And 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>I don't know, oh yeah. So I have a max <span style="color:red" data-ts="2044.525" data-end_ts="2044.685" title="2044.525" id=c_"2044.525">__for__</span> live device that I use, which helps me quite a lot with, with adding variation to the, to the performance, which is the DRG, the dual rhythm generator. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I'm actually looking at your site right now, and I see it's listed, it's shown as one of the, one of the max for <span style="color:red" data-ts="2061.725" data-end_ts="2061.925" title="2061.725" id=c_"2061.725">__life__</span> products you have. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Yeah. So it, it basically, it generates two clocks. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But the thing is, you can have different settings for the clocks and it has a logic operator in the middle. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>So you can apply, like you can use bullion logic to add or subtract them, you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Know? Nice, nice. Yeah, sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>And the thing is, you can save these pre, you can save presets on <span style="color:red" data-ts="2088.115" data-end_ts="2088.405" title="2088.115" id=c_"2088.115">__MIDI__</span> notes. Right. So you can use like a controller to switch the thing between the different presets and effectively, effectively have like different clocks and different rhythm <span style="color:red" data-ts="2099.665" data-end_ts="2099.885" title="2099.665" id=c_"2099.665">__gen__</span> rhythm variations, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I'm looking at this and it actually looks like you map an octave of the keyboard to be able to switch within presets. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>So <span style="color:red" data-ts="2109.765" data-end_ts="2109.885" title="2109.765" id=c_"2109.765">__I__</span> can have, like, if I press like C3, it gives me like a 16th and an eighth 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2115.945" data-end_ts="2116.165" title="2115.945" id=c_"2115.945">__To__</span> two clocks. And then if I press like D three, I can get like a quarter node and a half node. Got it. You know, so you can, you can have different clocks for each of the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2125.485" data-end_ts="2125.645" title="2125.485" id=c_"2125.485">__mini__</span> nodes, basically. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. That's pretty smart that, that also makes a lot of sense for live performance because changing presets within live can be a little bit painful. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Oh yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But having that kind of, that kind of mapping makes it really easy to switch back and forth. That's cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>And the thing is, because you have like the logic operator in the middle Right. You can create different rhythms and then change the rhythms using <span style="color:red" data-ts="2150.325" data-end_ts="2150.445" title="2150.325" id=c_"2150.325">__a__</span> media controller. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. That's really smart. So, we're getting, we're already kinda used up a lot of the time <laugh>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2160.315" data-end_ts="2160.605" title="2160.315" id=c_"2160.315">__burn__</span> through that quick enough. Why don't I have you, first of all, suggest to people who want to take a taste. You have a couple of free products that you have. Yeah. If you wanted people to get a taste of what the Spectra audio kind of gestalt is, what what would you recommend that they try out first? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>I'll be honest with you, the free projects, there are a couple of them. They're not all CV related. Right. I have one which is called CV two kit as well, which was actually the first CV device that I made. Sure. And it generates like two, it can generate LFOs and simple and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2204.845" data-end_ts="2205.085" title="2204.845" id=c_"2204.845">__whole__</span> signals and envelopes. Basic envelopes. Okay. Right. So you can try that one if you wanna try like CV, generating CV with your computer. Okay. One of my most popular free projects is the PSS eight, which is a, is a sequencer for the ableson push Uhhuh 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>So it lets you use the ableson push like, like a basically con like an analog sequencer. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So how do you, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2233.185" data-end_ts="2233.405" title="2233.185" id=c_"2233.185">__how__</span>, what does, how does the push interact with it? Do you have to go into user mode or like custom mode or does it interact through the, through the control knobs? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Yeah. It's actually quite hacky <laugh> because, you, when you open up the device, it has like a active button that you have to press. Okay. In order to gain x gain control of the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2259.405" data-end_ts="2259.525" title="2259.405" id=c_"2259.405">__a__</span> push uhhuh <affirmative>. So once you press that, the Max five device basically takes over a couple of the <laugh> push. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I'm sure the able <span style="color:red" data-ts="2269.445" data-end_ts="2269.645" title="2269.445" id=c_"2269.445">__to__</span> people love you <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Well, the, the story behind it's is <span style="color:red" data-ts="2275.605" data-end_ts="2275.725" title="2275.605" id=c_"2275.605">__a__</span>, I found this, it's like an SDK for the push Right. And slash max four <span style="color:red" data-ts="2281.485" data-end_ts="2281.645" title="2281.485" id=c_"2281.485">__life__</span> uhhuh, and then I manage. So it allows you to use the knobs and the pads and the different buttons of the push to control your max four live devices. Right. And then once you click the push control button on the device, you can use the knobs to change like the pitch of each of the steps. You can <span style="color:red" data-ts="2299.245" data-end_ts="2299.405" title="2299.245" id=c_"2299.245">__change__</span>, you can use the pads to activate and deactivate the pads and all that kind of stuff. That's cool. The steps, I mean. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Looking at this, you have, the one that really actually has me kind of intrigued is you have this thing called the Twist Wrangler <laugh>, although it's kind of like written in Hacker Lang lingo. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>That was, that was just a silly project. <laugh>. Okay. It's like a, it's like a circuit <span style="color:red" data-ts="2324.035" data-end_ts="2324.325" title="2324.035" id=c_"2324.035">__band__</span> synth. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Got it. Because the reason I ask is it's, it does something that I really like on kind of like idiosyncratic little stuff, which is that it has knobs and buttons in a slider. None of 'em have labels on 'em. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Yeah. <laugh>, which 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I love that because it means that when I use it and I turn a knob and something happens, I in my head say, oh, this is the thing that like messes up the frequency. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> when really it might be an FM controller, it might be a, a ring modulator who, who the heck knows what it is. Right. But I get to sort 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Of, I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Don't know, <laugh>, I, I get to like define in my own head what that thing does. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Yeah. Yeah. That was, that was the idea behind it. I just wanted to like, to make a little synth that you can just play with the knobs and come up with different and weird sounds. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And now, in terms of the premium devices you have, what's the one that represents kinda like your coolest and most recent work? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>The most recent one is the Nucleation mark two, which is a wave shaper and digital distortion device. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, cool. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>And that one's, you can, it's a wave shaper that you can create your own waveforms. It has like a waveform mixer <span style="color:red" data-ts="2400.425" data-end_ts="2400.845" title="2400.425" id=c_"2400.425">__pretty__</span>, but I, I think my favorites, it's gotta be grain fluxx, which is one of my synths. And it's a granular synthesizer, but the thing is, instead of only taking one grain, it takes two grains and then you can cross fade and morph between them. And it has, I, I try to come up with different synthesis techniques. So like the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2423.965" data-end_ts="2424.125" title="2423.965" id=c_"2423.965">__way__</span> it takes two different grains Yeah. Of the weight of the sample. Right. But it has, like, for example, it has a tilt parameter, which increases the size of one grain while decreasing the size of the other one. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Yeah. So it, you can get different sounds and it's really interesting. I really like it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's awesome. That's really cool. And you know, I think I, I actually think for all of the discussion about granular synthesis, there are still relatively few ways to play around with it and they all kind of tend to do the same thing. So it's nice to see you taking a different approach to it. That's cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Nucleation <span style="color:red" data-ts="2462.845" data-end_ts="2463.045" title="2462.845" id=c_"2462.845">__brain__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2463.045" data-end_ts="2463.325" title="2463.045" id=c_"2463.045">__flux__</span>. I think those are my two favorites. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, thanks a lot for that kind of overview of some of the recent stuff. It's pretty interesting and I can't wait to spend a little more time with it. Lately I've been, I've really been immersing myself in a lot of, live based stuff. So this is, this is really gonna be interesting. One final question, which is, what, what in the whole world of music and technology, what's the thing that has you most excited right now other than, other than modular? 'cause you already said that you love modulars, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>But Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I mean, you're doing a lot of work with computers and you're doing a lot of work with devices and you kinda let slip that, oh, I've got a 6 0 6 and stuff like that. So clearly it's not just a modular and a computer. You have other stuff. Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b><affirmative> what are, what 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Are the things that you see out there that really get you excited? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Can it, could it be like a trend? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>That great <span style="color:red" data-ts="2516.205" data-end_ts="2516.325" title="2516.205" id=c_"2516.205">__idea__</span>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2516.325" data-end_ts="2516.445" title="2516.325" id=c_"2516.325">__Because__</span> I really like, the thing that really inspires me is the, is integrating the old and the new stuff and the analog and the digital stuff. And I think that's the way the future is bringing everything together. And like, another thing that really excites me nowadays is Ableton Link Uhhuh. So that's another way that you can integrate something else to your setup. So if I could pick a trend, I would pick this trend of integrating everything and getting everything to work together. Getting the latest iOS app to sync with your <span style="color:red" data-ts="2546.395" data-end_ts="2546.685" title="2546.395" id=c_"2546.395">__drum__</span> machine from 40 years ago, you know? Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, that's that. That's great. That's a great point. And the fact that we can do it at all is pretty amazing. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>I think that that's what excites me. Yeah. I'll, I'll pick 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That. That's a good one. Well, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2560.225" data-end_ts="2560.445" title="2560.225" id=c_"2560.225">__iru__</span>, I, I really appreciate you, spending the time talking with me. It was really interesting to hear kind of about your journey, but also about the kind of things you're in. And, you've actually given me a couple of things to try and patch up this afternoon to try and improve my performance stuff. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2576.325" data-end_ts="2576.445" title="2576.325" id=c_"2576.325">__Cool__</span>. Because I, I like talking to people who have, who have wrestled with that with some of these same ideas because I think it's a sticky one. It's hard to Oh yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2583.925" data-end_ts="2584.125" title="2583.925" id=c_"2583.925">__Drive__</span> performance work. And especially with the modular 'cause you're worried about so many things. So it's interesting to catch some tips on that. I appreciate it. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>Thanks for having me. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>
</p>

<p>
<b>Ícaro: </b>It was a lot of fun. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2594.755" data-end_ts="2595.245" title="2594.755" id=c_"2594.755">__Alright__</span>, I'll catch you later. 
</p>

<p>
