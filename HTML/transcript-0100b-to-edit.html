<b>Darwin: </b>This is part two of a podcast interview with me, Darwin Gross. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It was, it was a cool thing, but really it was Grant. And then by extension Grant, you know, once the internet started coming into play, we got to know some people in the area, particular people down in Chicago, like Michael Furman, John pki, these people who eventually formed this group meme, the Midwest Electronic Music Ensemble. <span style="color:red" data-ts="41.505" data-end_ts="41.725" title="41.505" id=c_"41.505">__And__</span> we would play together, but we'd also hang out together and talk smart about stuff. Right? And then we got to know Andre Schroeder, which is a, a composer that happened to be living in Milwaukee at the time. He, he would work with us and, and record with us a little bit, phenomenally talented and absolute bastard of a man, <laugh>. But he was, he was an incredible person. And, and all these people just kept on, like, on a weekly basis, like whole universe would get unlocked. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>For me, it was fantastic. And that was, that was really, that combined with that opening of my mind, combined with the fact that I was, you know, I had started when I was in, in Northern Wisconsin, but really, once I moved to Milwaukee is when I really honed my programming, my technical skills, programming skills, and really, really got to be quite a good programmer. And then I had a job, I had, I had this one job that was just horrible. So I started trying to find other things to do things related to music or electronic music particular that I could do to at least make a little money. And, one of the first ones, well, even before trying to make money, what I wanted to do is I wanted to just get my name out there. And luckily this new thing called the internet was starting to get a popular. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And, I was really into both analog and digital gear. And so one of the things I got was my first, one of my first really high, high <span style="color:red" data-ts="138.305" data-end_ts="138.525" title="138.305" id=c_"138.305">__end__</span> ish keyboards that I purchased after the SQ one was this PV keyboard called the DPM, the DPM one, or M three. The DPM was a really peculiar thing because it, it had both wave table samples, but you could also load in your own samples. And it had a very sophisticated and good sounding audio engine. And I liked it. I liked it 'cause I could do a lot of composition on this thing because it was multi tabil, and it did a pretty good job of it. And I, I actually was doing, like, I did a couple of, I did a film score for a, a commercial or for like a training video and stuff like that, just using the DPM and <span style="color:red" data-ts="183.125" data-end_ts="183.285" title="183.125" id=c_"183.125">__the__</span>, and and cakewalk. But, eventually I, I was like, I wanted something more. And then I <span style="color:red" data-ts="192.205" data-end_ts="192.445" title="192.205" id=c_"192.205">__start__</span>, started seeing the ads for this new Kurzwell K 2000. So I worked with the local music store. I was like, the second one comes in, I'll buy it. And so one came in and I found a credit card with enough room on it, and I threw the credit card at the guys. And I took home my <span style="color:red" data-ts="209.045" data-end_ts="209.165" title="209.045" id=c_"209.045">__K__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="209.395" data-end_ts="209.685" title="209.395" id=c_"209.395">__ksal__</span> K 2000, and I just ran into the most incredible sonic environment I'd ever worked with. Right. Oh, oh, yeah. You're still, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory Taylor: </b>No, I, no, sorry. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm No, that's great. Sorry. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>I, the thing you can't hear since I have headphones on, is you can't hear all these shoes dropping <laugh>. I know. <span style="color:red" data-ts="227.265" data-end_ts="227.485" title="227.265" id=c_"227.265">__No__</span>. Look, I know you don't like to talk about yourself, but what's been really interesting about this is if you stitch all this together, there's a whole bunch of stuff about you that suddenly makes ah, interesting. A whole lot more sense. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Of, well, with the dpm, with the DPM three, one of the things I had done was I knew programming well enough that I made a win, or a Doss Doss editor for the DPM three, and I got to know the people at pv and they let me put an ad in their little user's newsletter. And so I got to know people all over America, all over the world, really, who would send me $35 and I'd send 'em a <span style="color:red" data-ts="263.085" data-end_ts="263.245" title="263.085" id=c_"263.085">__disc__</span>, and then we'd talk about the DPM, right? But I get this <span style="color:red" data-ts="267.145" data-end_ts="267.365" title="267.145" id=c_"267.145">__KZ__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="267.365" data-end_ts="267.565" title="267.365" id=c_"267.365">__while__</span>, and simultaneous to that, this internet thing is cropping up. And, you know, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="274.525" data-end_ts="274.685" title="274.525" id=c_"274.525">__had__</span>, I started to get to know people on the internet through lists, like the E <span style="color:red" data-ts="278.885" data-end_ts="279.125" title="278.885" id=c_"278.885">__Music__</span> L list and the synth L list. And that's how I got to know Mike Matley and Nick Rothwell and all these people. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But, also, there was a list for, a list got started for the Kurzwell K 2000. So I'm like, let's rock on. So I get on there and unfortunately it's like, you know, I'm, I'm watching this. And the list is like, well, I really like preset 221 a lot better in 223, because the reverbs down a little bit. And so it's a better sound, right? And I'm like, oh, come on, man. You can do better than this. 'cause I was like, I was like on this list about analog, you know, analog gear that, that, grant and those people <span style="color:red" data-ts="322.285" data-end_ts="322.445" title="322.285" id=c_"322.285">__had__</span> turned me on <span style="color:red" data-ts="322.885" data-end_ts="323.045" title="322.885" id=c_"322.885">__to__</span>. And there, you know, people are like, you know, yeah, the, the residents at, at 72% is just perfect on the OB <span style="color:red" data-ts="331.285" data-end_ts="331.765" title="331.285" id=c_"331.285">__IOB__</span> eight. But if you do that same thing on <span style="color:red" data-ts="333.805" data-end_ts="334.525" title="333.805" id=c_"333.805">__AOBX__</span>, it sounds terrible <laugh>, right. You know, so they would get into these incredible levels of detail that I just ate up, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I get on this Criss <span style="color:red" data-ts="342.565" data-end_ts="342.765" title="342.565" id=c_"342.565">__Oil__</span> thing, and it's like, eh, I'm really having trouble fitting this into my church band, or whatever. So I was like, this thing has got the most incredible synth engine since ever, so I'm gonna start doing something about it. So I started off by writing a, an article that said that was basically, I, I wrote a article for the list that was like, you know what? You need to be able to program your own sounds. So let's start off with, two oscillator, one filter, VCA voice with an envelope. Okay? Now, what happens if we modulate the envelope? Now, what happens if we modulate the VCA? Now, what happens if we put a different oscillator in, or we try a different waveform? And I did this series of like 20 posts that were outrageous. They were phenomenal, phenomenally successful. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I mean, people would just ask questions. And all of a sudden, you know, people, people from all over the world are contacting me and be like, oh, that's really great. I have so much appreciate it. Let me send you an album that I did based off of the stuff you did. I mean, still to this day, especially if, especially if I'm in Europe, I notice this when I, whenever I go to the Music Mesa, there are people there that when they see my badge as Darwin Gross, they're like, oh, everything, everything I do today is because I, I learned your programming tutorials, right? So I wrote these tutorials were, well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>That's how I, that's how I first, that's how I first encountered you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, really? The <span style="color:red" data-ts="438.885" data-end_ts="439.125" title="438.885" id=c_"438.885">__<inaudible>__</span> tutorials? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Absolutely. Oh, unreal. Absolutely not. Not just that, the thing that was really interesting about them was they were, they were really well written, and they assumed you didn't know. They didn't assume that you didn't know anything. Right. And they basically, like, walked you through something. And frankly, tutorials in those days were really associated, were often associated with very, very different things than that. They weren't oriented necessarily toward discovery as they were a very narrow set of goals. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, it's, it's funny you say that because when I think of what, you know, it, like Keyboard Magazine would have, like, you know, we'll teach you to play, like, you know, to do this lick from a Toto album, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And that was the goal. The goal was to emulate something like that. And my thing was like, you have this incredible engine. You need to understand what you have under your fingers so that you don't spend your time choosing between presets 2 21 and 2 23. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Right. There's no reason in the world you couldn't be making the presets. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Exactly. And that really kind of blew up. I, again, I got to know a lot of people. I got to know, certainly a lot of people that were artists that were using, and, and I got, I would get emails from just <span style="color:red" data-ts="513.145" data-end_ts="513.365" title="513.145" id=c_"513.145">__pe__</span> people that I couldn't believe they were emailing me. I mean, and some of 'em are funny. I mean, I remember when Constance Darby sent me a note and offered to send me, send me an album and stuff. And I was like, I can't believe Constance Darby New Age Star is sending me, is offering to send me a cd. That was fantastic. You know, it blew me away. But also I got to know Chuck <span style="color:red" data-ts="537.005" data-end_ts="537.485" title="537.005" id=c_"537.005">__Schrock__</span> at, at, at Sweetwater, who was just a fabulous supporter of the community at the time. I mean, he helped, he put together some contests in the Kurzwell community that got a lot of people excited about doing interesting and new work, and built a lot of presets for people to be able to share. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And that was really great. But also at the time, I was going through some, my, my wife, my, so I was married a second time by then to my current, the woman who was my current wife, and who was always super supportive of all of this stuff. It was really amazing. But she was at the time working in Japan for a year. So I was living in the States by myself. So taking on a project, like I'm gonna Teach the World to Program a Kurzwell K 2000 seemed perfectly in order. Right? <laugh>. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Yeah, some task to fill your time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, of course. But also, I kind <span style="color:red" data-ts="588.245" data-end_ts="588.365" title="588.245" id=c_"588.245">__of__</span> ran into a buzz <span style="color:red" data-ts="589.345" data-end_ts="589.565" title="589.345" id=c_"589.345">__saw__</span> with my ex-wife. That was a huge financial hit, and it caused me to have to sell all of my gear, all of the gear I had accumulated to that point I had to sell, which I did. And then I had to write this kind of sad note to the Kurzwell list saying, you know, due to these financial difficulties, I'm afraid I'm going to have to, step aside now. And, and I was like, it's gonna be just too painful to follow the list, so I'm gonna sign out. Right. And I did, and I mean, I got tons of condolence letters and people were so sweet about it, but also I started getting $50 checks. So people had decided that, that, you know, this is really unfortunate, and that I had helped them. So they decided to, as a group, whoever was able to, should just send me, send me a check. So they had gotten my address. I just started getting these checks, some of 'em for 50, some of 'em for a lot more. And, it allowed me to buy a Kurzwell, what at the time was the top of the line machine, a Kurzwell K two vx, which I still have. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Wow. That's a <span style="color:red" data-ts="660.565" data-end_ts="660.765" title="660.565" id=c_"660.565">__step__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="660.765" data-end_ts="660.965" title="660.765" id=c_"660.765">__that__</span>, that's, kind of a, well, when we talk about the internet, that's, there's this thing that we keep talking about, and that is, it lets us extend our interest beyond our little narrow circle of light. And the other part of it is you can never tell where what you do is going to land 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well. Right. I had never really understood, I mean, it was kind of interesting for me to think about, well, you know, I can talk to people on analog heaven, and now I don't have to move to London or Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> or to San Francisco in order to be surrounded by synth <span style="color:red" data-ts="693.645" data-end_ts="693.885" title="693.645" id=c_"693.645">__heads__</span>. Right. Or like in the K 2000 thing, I can talk to people about this incredible sound engine, and I don't have to be employed by someone in order to do it. I have the mechanism, you know, I don't have to be a keyboard writer or a manual writer for Kurzweil in order to be able to talk and share this kind of stuff. And I just didn't recognize how wide of a throw that had. That's, that threw me for a real loop. I didn't understand or get that that was how big this was. Right. So, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Well, part of it, I mean, but part of it is you got there one little step at a time, so it must have been really overwhelming to suddenly, do you know what I mean? It's suddenly like, well, we think of it in terms of electricity. The spark leaps across the gap. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>And the last thing you were expecting was this spark to, you know, it should to have something show up in your mailbox like that, or Constant Debi sends you tapes. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, right. Exactly. So, and so, you know, that was a, that was real wonderful. And then, Chuck again offered to, to help, he gave me an opportunity to do some programming work, for him and stuff like that. And all this stuff really kind of helped me get back on my feet. And, I kind of got back into recording again. And, this is when things were really starting to move with my interaction with Grant and stuff like that. That was really great. But because of those Kurzwell tutorial things, this guy Mike Matley writes me a note and he's like, I see you around the, the emus <span style="color:red" data-ts="794.685" data-end_ts="794.805" title="794.685" id=c_"794.685">__l__</span> and <span style="color:red" data-ts="795.365" data-end_ts="795.605" title="795.365" id=c_"795.365">__<inaudible>__</span> things, but someone just laid these kurzwell things on, and they're really incredible. And do you wanna write, I just got this new job with Recording Magazine. Do you wanna write for Recording Magazine? I was like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="806.875" data-end_ts="807.165" title="806.875" id=c_"806.875">__well__</span>, yeah, that sounds like fun. And so he starts sending me gear and I start doing reviews. To this date, I've done almost, I think, I think it's getting close to 150 articles for a recording magazine. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Oh my goodness. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. And, you know, that's, that was, that was a really neat door that swung open. And then because of the Kurzwell tutorials and the fact that I just started writing for Recording Magazine, one of the first things I reviewed was Native Instruments Generator, which was a precursor to Reactor. Yes, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>That's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. And, I wrote about it and, and gave a very detailed, and well, you know, because my experience now included all this stuff with ULAs and Aries and Moogs and Surges. So I knew my modular stuff cold, right. So I could talk about what they were providing with <span style="color:red" data-ts="860.025" data-end_ts="860.245" title="860.025" id=c_"860.025">__the__</span> real sense of understanding. So they got in touch with me, and they're like, we're having trouble with this manual thing. Can you help us out? And so I actually worked on some, worked on a rewrite that never got issued of the Reactor manual, but then, they were, they decided they wanted to put out a profit five emulator called the Pro Pro Five, and they asked if I would write the manual for it. So I did. And it was phenomenally successful. So then they came out with this thing called the B the B four, which was an organ plugin, also did Phenomenal. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I wrote the manual for that. And, then Battery came out and I wrote the manual for that. And, you know, I was kind of doing their manuals and stuff, and then, but I liked all that software, but I was really kind of into Max. And that was when I was a max beta tester for early version of Plug <span style="color:red" data-ts="919.045" data-end_ts="919.165" title="919.045" id=c_"919.045">__O__</span>. And I would talk to David <span style="color:red" data-ts="921.685" data-end_ts="921.925" title="921.685" id=c_"921.685">__Elli__</span> a lot because, you know, I was, by this time I was running a business, that did, business database software, you know, so we could talk about business being business, and, but I could also talk about, you know, what I thought, you know, could help Max and what I thought could help plug <span style="color:red" data-ts="942.565" data-end_ts="942.685" title="942.565" id=c_"942.565">__o__</span> and stuff like that. And, I had this, no, this was before I actually, had, well, this is after I, so I sold this company. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I didn't get very much for it, but then I got this job. It was a horrible, horrible job working at a place that I won't name in Milwaukee. But, there was a person who, who, who was there, who had a very bad, it was, it was just a bad environment. He, he was, he, he provided a bad environment to work in. I couldn't stand it. And David has always maintained this part of his website where it's in some way says, if you're incredibly good at what you do, and you want to be incredibly underpaid, <laugh>, let me know. Right. <laugh>. And so I was like, well, at this point in time, being underpaid for something that didn't make me sick every day had <span style="color:red" data-ts="1000.005" data-end_ts="1000.085" title="1000.005" id=c_"1000.005">__to__</span> be a good thing. So I called him up and I said, Hey, you know, you're, you're working on this plug <span style="color:red" data-ts="1005.605" data-end_ts="1005.805" title="1005.605" id=c_"1005.605">__out__</span> thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You've got other things. I've been doing this documentation stuff. I've been doing these reviews. How about you let me work for you. So he said, sure. And I started, my first job was doing a rework of a bunch of the SDK manual. And, from there then, it just kind of exploded. I did the cell block object, I did some debugging work, I did some fix, its here and there. Eventually got to be the head of engineering and then, then spun off and have been working on educational and documentational information since. So that's how I got to where I am today. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Crazy <span style="color:red" data-ts="1054.725" data-end_ts="1054.845" title="1054.725" id=c_"1054.725">__Ride__</span>. And the phrase I was gonna say, what were the, the phrase what a long, strange trip it's been, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm telling you. Well, and it's funny because I actually, once I started working at 74, I'd always, one of the, one of the things that happens when you're, in these heavily religious backgrounds growing up is you tend to not have great educational backgrounds. I had crap for education. So I actually, once I started at cycling, I went back to school and I got both my bachelor's and master's. And subsequently, now I am, teaching at the University of Denver. I teach a class, one class every quarter. But one of the things a lot of students will ask me is like, how do we get to be, how do I get a job like yours? And I was like, man, all I can tell you is I have no idea. Yeah. I got, I got my job because I happened to be willing to write a tutorial at the beginning of the worldwide web. That's how I got my job. <laugh>. I don't know how you're gonna get yours. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Well, I mean, that's, that's a real problem. We have this notion that I don't really, you know, for most of us, we, when we think about finding our artistic voice or things like that, we tend to think of it as being, we describe it to people as being really individual. Right. Because that's, we're artists, that's how we're supposed to think of ourselves. But somehow or other, when it comes to doing things like work, we suddenly fall back on this idea of, credential and expertise and stuff like that. And it ceases being, an entirely personal thing and turns into this, set of boxes that we have to, that we have to check off. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Absolutely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>One of the things that strikes me about this is it is true that some of that's about being in the right place at the right time. And having talked to you for about this, now you can link that little line of shadowy tracks in the snow back to the cabin you left. Right. You know what I mean? Right. You can sort of do that, but it's not, it's not something that's going to, to translate into a narrative for somebody else. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. It doesn't, it doesn't turn into a path to a career that's Right. Now, one of the things I would say is that I think the current generation is really lucky in comparison to my generation in terms of the barrier to entry. So one of the things I would say is that when I got started, I mean, I actually had <span style="color:red" data-ts="1195.485" data-end_ts="1195.685" title="1195.485" id=c_"1195.485">__an__</span> entrepreneurial flare. I started companies, you know, so, and certainly when I started this database company, one of the things I thought about is how to start a company doing music software. Right? But first of all, it was very hard to make a computer do this kind of stuff. I mean, when you look at the Annals, I mean, now we look at the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1217.725" data-end_ts="1218.045" title="1217.725" id=c_"1217.725">__animals__</span> of these people struggling to make computer music, and we're like, what could possibly have been so hard? All you had to have on is idea, right? But back then, I mean, literally you were hand wiring cards so that when you flip certain registers, they would make a click, and then you would string enough clicks together to make a sound, and then you would hope that you could get a computer that would run fast enough to make a sound for a second. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>It's so easy to hear that story and to think, and to think of it as being quaint rather than the way that things are. The music that came outta that was integrally related to something having to do with what you think of as the quaint part of the story. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>One of the things I would say is that to a certain extent, this just shows how powerful music is, because it was an epic struggle to get a damn computer to make it, to make sound. Right. And, absolutely. The fact that people stuck with it through the hellacious trail trials that they had to do in order to pull it off is amazing to me, because it just shows the, it just shows the level of will that, that people had behind finding a way to make music using these new devices. You know, I think there was a certain sense to which, if we can do it, it's gonna be amazing. And so that's what, you know, that's why we should do it. But the, the efforts that it took to, to do that, I mean, I had an experience when I was at North Texas. They were trying to make an ear training course to run on a computer so that, you know, they could have people practice ear training without having to have an instructor in the room. And, you know, it, we were hand wiring boards for AP two P 11 7 80, which was the size of several refrigerators, and 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>That's a great big box. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1335.905" data-end_ts="1336.125" title="1335.905" id=c_"1335.905">__And__</span> yeah. And that was, that was the mechanism by which having something go beep that represented a middle C was done. You know, it was, it was outlandish. But again, people, people with much more vision than me, were looking at that and saying, man, if we get this to work, it's gonna be amazing. So 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>There's also the sense, though, in which constraint focuses your activity in ways that's not the case now. I mean, we, we don't really wanna get into one of those, you kids today. I have no idea how good you've got at things, but I want to turn that around and to say, one of the interesting things about that activity is that there's a real sense in which being able to do anything gives you a much more frightening future than one, which is more constrained by certain kinds of technological challenges. It's not as, it, it's not as scary because you can't do everything. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. But now I would, I would also balance that I, and I've heard that from other people talking about the, the availability of constraints. And, and I do it for myself lately. I've been using an electron octa <span style="color:red" data-ts="1409.525" data-end_ts="1409.765" title="1409.525" id=c_"1409.525">__track__</span>, which in comparison to able <span style="color:red" data-ts="1411.765" data-end_ts="1411.965" title="1411.765" id=c_"1411.765">__to__</span> live is incredibly, has incredibly tight constraints. But I do it because it puts me in a good artistic place. Now, the one thing I would say though is that a lot of the constraints were sort of like, they did not seem like an unvarnished win at the time, because unless you were of a certain mindset, it was very difficult to be satisfied with your work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1441.945" data-end_ts="1442.165" title="1441.945" id=c_"1441.945">__Oh__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. We're talking about a time when <span style="color:red" data-ts="1444.775" data-end_ts="1445.645" title="1444.775" id=c_"1444.775">__Glenn Johns__</span> is spending millions of dollars to make the ultimate album, or Becker and Fagan will spend, you know, a decade crafting the perfect album. And I am in my basement with an ESQ one, you know, making four squeaky notes and then bouncing it down to a two <span style="color:red" data-ts="1465.645" data-end_ts="1465.885" title="1465.645" id=c_"1465.645">__track__</span> cassette. And trying to align those in some way was really difficult. And it was also difficult to say, you know, to to say, other than for pure kitch factor, you know, making a four track squeaky tone, was it, it didn't seem satisfying in some way. It didn't seem like I was doing the work that I was hearing in my head. And so, you know, I'm sure there were, there were people for whom chip tune music was what they heard in their head. For me, chip <span style="color:red" data-ts="1499.605" data-end_ts="1499.885" title="1499.605" id=c_"1499.605">__tune__</span>, chip <span style="color:red" data-ts="1500.405" data-end_ts="1500.645" title="1500.405" id=c_"1500.405">__tune__</span> music was a failure in comparison to what I, what I had in my head. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>See. And so I couldn't be satisfied with Chiptune music, even though I was making it 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Interesting. So maybe part of that question has to do, and you've, you've alluded to this along the way, this notion about how it is since you started out doing stuff by yourself, I guess I have a sort of a question for you about how do you think you came to learning to trust yourself? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I, I would say I don't, I mean, one of the reasons I have very little released material is because I never, I never trust myself to come up with an end product. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1545.175" data-end_ts="1545.395" title="1545.175" id=c_"1545.175">__Oh__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I have hours and hours and hours of recorded material, which you'll never hear the light of day because I, I've moved on and I don't even want to go through the editing process of that. Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b><affirmative>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Or my recollection of it was, and this is what, this is the funny one, my recollection of it was that it sounded like shit. And then I, if I do back and listen <span style="color:red" data-ts="1571.185" data-end_ts="1571.345" title="1571.185" id=c_"1571.185">__to__</span> it, I'm like, oh man, that was surprisingly awesome. Right, <laugh>. Yeah. But, you know, at the time it didn't feel like whatever epic I had in my head at the time. And so, you know, there you go. And so what I find is actually, I really work best in two modes. One is live performance, because I'm just like shooting it out there and I never have to think about it again. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Ah, of course. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Or the other thing is working in collaboration or working on other people's material. It's why I'm always much more, you know, I've been doing mastering engineering for quite some time. I got a number of, I worked with a number of labels over the years as their mastering engineer, and one of the things I loved about it is it wasn't my stuff. So all I had to do was make it as good as it was gonna sound. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And it wasn't my responsibility for either the content or the quality. I just had to make it as good as it could be. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Well, I can't really say I've had any complaints with your work so far, just personally <laugh> Well, there you go. Sorry. A disclaimer <span style="color:red" data-ts="1641.125" data-end_ts="1641.205" title="1641.125" id=c_"1641.125">__is__</span> an order here. Darwin has, mastered pretty much everything I think I've commercially released just about and produced quite a lot of it as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. I do that though, because I like the music that you do. I mean, now I'm in a lucky position. I have, I have a great job, but I also have a family that's pretty demanding and stuff, so it's not like I'm gonna sit around and do an extra 30 hours a week of mastering work. Right. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> I only do mastering or production work of things that I enjoy doing, but there still is sort of like that built in limit, which is like, it's a whole lot more efficient if I'm working with somebody else's stuff because I, I can make decisions about your work. It's my work that I hate making decisions about. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Got it. Yeah. I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1689.405" data-end_ts="1689.525" title="1689.405" id=c_"1689.405">__actually__</span>, I guess I've been doing a little bit of remixing recently and I, I think I have a sense of what you mean about that. It's less scary. You don't have the sense, you don't always have the sense that everything you do is derivative the moment you do it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Yeah. That's a big one. The other one is that, that hits me all the time because I, I do have a tendency to sort of like chase interests around is I'll do something and then two weeks later I'm on, I discovered something else that in my mind is so much better than that previous thing I was doing. And so that builds in this kind of like cautionary story in your head, which is like, what if I do a thing that I'm embarrassed of? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You know, and there again, you know, sort of like the shaming systems of my youth come into full bloom as an adult <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Yeah. Well, absolutely. <laugh>, we did. That is one of those things that does come back to <span style="color:red" data-ts="1747.965" data-end_ts="1748.165" title="1747.965" id=c_"1747.965">__Bo__</span> or who do you, don't think you're anyone special. Right, right. One of my favorites 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Person who do you think you are to.dot. Right, exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Yeah. But you know, what's really interesting about a lot of your discussion is that there are so many people who kind of came out of that background who I would think would somehow get this idea that great stuff or compelling stuff is always made by somebody with more stuff someplace you can't be. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I mean, there was, there was a certain amount of that, there was a certain amount of saying, I can't make a good release because I don't have an excellent reverb. Right. Or I, you know, especially if you think of in, in terms of making a career out of it, I can't do this because I'm unwilling to live in la. Which for me is very much the case. I mean, I have had, in one way or another, most of my adult life, I have been responsible for at least one child. Right? Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And so there are a lot of places you don't live where if you have kids, LA's not a great kid live <span style="color:red" data-ts="1815.085" data-end_ts="1815.285" title="1815.085" id=c_"1815.085">__in__</span> place. Not ki part of LA where you're gonna be involved in music and recording. Right. San Francisco not a great place to be roam around with kid, especially if you're doing that without a lot of money. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Yeah, I was gonna say, unless you're independently wealthy, it's difficult place 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>To live. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1832.485" data-end_ts="1832.645" title="1832.485" id=c_"1832.485">__Yeah__</span>. And see that's the thing, the independently wealthy thing is, I think in a lot of cases when people look at someone who's working in music or working in, music software, whatever, there's almost an implication that, well, you come from a really privileged background and I talk about my parents and this company that they run stuff. And it could be easily construed to think that that's what it was. Right. But also I was, I think, a great disappointment to him. And so there was no, there was no flow of money into my pocket. I've been a working guy for most of my adult life, just because I've always had responsibilities. And so with those responsibilities come limits, and some of the limits are, I can't live in Manhattan. I can't live in San Francisco and I can't live in la you know, in the cool part of LA because that's not conducive to this other part of my life. I have to serve. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Mm-Hmm. But you're lucky enough now to live in a world in which you have at least access to hear what's going on in those places. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, not only that, but I also have the ability to work for a company that's based outta San Francisco. And I live on the top of a mountain in Colorado. It's fabulous. But there again, I moved up here 12 years ago, 14 years ago, I wouldn't have believed such a thing was possible <laugh>. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So I, I kind of push, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1916.365" data-end_ts="1916.525" title="1916.365" id=c_"1916.365">__kind__</span> of ride at the front end of stuff. Now also, you ask some about like how it is, I feel confident enough to do this in a lot of cases. It wasn't a sense of confidence. It was just having kind of the balls to do it. This is particularly true when it came to the mastering thing, <laugh>, the reason that I got into mastering was because I had this job working for a company. And part of the job was that every year I could take between a thousand and $1,500 and purchased some technological thing for my own use. You know, so a lot of people would use it to continuously upgrade their computers or get a one of the fancy pants, new flat screen monitors or whatever. Well, one year I used it to get a one speed CD rom burner. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Oh. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Which nobody else in the world really had at the time. Right. It was so rare. Cost, I think $1,295. And I got that and I got a copy of the software that digit design made that allowed you to make an indexed cd. And then I called up my friend Mike Bentley, and I'm like, Hey, I hear you're doing a CD and I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1992.585" data-end_ts="1992.745" title="1992.585" id=c_"1992.585">__got__</span> a CD burner, and why don't we do something? And I talked to a bunch of people in analog heaven and, and we were putting together this idea for <span style="color:red" data-ts="2001.705" data-end_ts="2001.825" title="2001.705" id=c_"2001.705">__a__</span>, an album. And I was like, well, I got the CD burner now, so send me all your stuff and we'll make the first, it was called the Electronic Music Project. And it was, we sold a ton of those CDs 'cause it was just a bunch of people from the analog heaven list that did AC did a cd. And you know, back at the time when nobody was able to put out personal CDs, I was able to do it. And so all of a sudden all these CDs start floating around with my name on it as mastering and production engineer. And so then labels were sort of like, Hey, I hear you. You do this stuff, can you do it for us too? And by then I, I had five or six of 'em under my belt. And I was like, and at the time too, man, an awful lot of CD pressings sounded horrible. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>True 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Enough. And so there was a very low bar for me, <laugh> to, to beat. I could, I could, I could beat that easily enough. 'cause I at least had ears. Right. I had been doing audio work since I was 12. So I had 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Since youre looking right, since you're looking at the masking tape on the old Exactly. Four dials. Exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. So I felt like I had ears were a lot of other people just had software they were looking at. And so that's how I got into, into the mastering game. And, you know, likewise, you know, with the recording thing, I happened to have that task <span style="color:red" data-ts="2082.525" data-end_ts="2082.745" title="2082.525" id=c_"2082.525">__in__</span> 80 dash eight back when not everybody had 'em. And there was another guy with a big console and another guy with a room. And we were like, Hey, let's pool our stuff and make a recording studio. And now all of a sudden I've put the crown of being a recording engineer on my head, not through any purposeful route, but because I happen to have enough gear to get the job done, and I had the balls to say I'm willing to do it 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>And to, and to actually do the hard work 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>As well. And to do it. Yeah. Right. It's not, yeah, it took a lot of study, right. When I was, when I was working on being a recording engineer, I would spend 10 hours a day in a studio and another eight hours a day at the university library pulling old copies of DB Magazine and, old, old recording thing. I mean, you'd get these books and they would basically show you, you know, how how you would set up the wire recorder for a proper recording <laugh>. Right. It was ridiculous. But all that stuff was elemental knowledge that I needed and I would absorb it like a sponge. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>So what are you sponging up now? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I mean, I was really excited with the new version of, of, analog gear. You know, I helped, I helped Grant, when he got Grant Richter get his wired business started. And that was really exciting time. That was cool. And I was just like really into the modular thing from then on. And so I had, I, you know, and I got into it now, if I would go over my history of gear I've owned, I have this tendency to like really get into a thing and then own all of it, and then just get frustrated with having so much stuff and then purging. So I'm really a binge and purge kind of a guy with gear. Well, I kind of like really binge on getting a whole ton of, of analog electronic gear. And then just realized that I felt like I was just surrounded by too much stuff. So I paired down to a tiny little, tiptop Station 2 52 case with the modules I really want in Euro rack format. You know, I'm still playing around with like the last ultimate filter and the perfect LFO for me. But, mostly it's a settled down system. But what I've kind of gotten into lately is the idea of interesting performance concepts and technologies. So, like I said, I'm a lot more comfortable with performance than like studio recording. Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b><affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But what that means is to be, I feel like to be a good performer with whatever tool you're using, you have to practice. So I have this kind of, I have this structure where I do daily practice on my modular synth. Right. I kind of wanted to have a corollary to that for the sequencing and the rest of the performance rig. And so prior to that, I'd been using an Ableton live system. I'm obviously very comfortable with Ableton Live and with Max for live and all that stuff. But it was almost as if that, that was too comfortable and too closely related to what I do as work. When something is too close to work, then to me it ceases being art. And so I needed to sort of extract myself from my work environment in order to, to do my performing environment. So I started working with external hardware for doing this stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So I, I tried a bunch. I, I really got into loopers and looping technology. But the problem with looping is that all looping performances seem to have this same sort of like device, which is, okay, I'm starting now, here's my first loop. Now I'm gonna layer my second loop. Now I'm gonna layer my third loop, which is great. The first time, you know, the first thing you do, it's really tiresome the fourth time you do it <laugh>. And I always try and be really honoring the people that are listening to my stuff. I'm sure they wouldn't think so <laugh>, but I at least like to think that I'm trying to honor the fact that there's an audience in the room. And I felt like that was not, that was not really being, I wasn't bringing sufficient material to the table when I was just using a looper. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So then I started working with different types of sequencers. I kind of went back, first of all, to some of my roots with the MPC series, thinking of that as sort of like a real <span style="color:red" data-ts="2355.045" data-end_ts="2355.325" title="2355.045" id=c_"2355.045">__time__</span> system. But the problem with that is it has a relatively inefficient sampling workflow. So it wasn't really conducive to doing sampling live. It was great for doing prepared stuff or for sort of like setting the table with sounds and doing live performance of percussive material or recording sample material of whatever sort. To me, I, I was like, well, if I'm really gonna make this part of the thing, I also want this live sampling kind of thing that a looper brings. You know, so how can I sort of mix and match what I'm comfortable with on the MPC, but with what I'm also comfortable with, with the looper, and also how do I reduce the amount of crap that I have? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So even as recently as in this August, I went for a, a little mini tour with my friend Mark Moser. We played a couple of towns in the Midwest. And, my rig at that point was my little modular, but then I had, the boss RC 5 0 5 Looper, which was as good of a looper as I could have hoped for, but it was just a looper. And then I had a, a Corg SX, drum machine sampler, which great for that percussive live thing, but also it didn't do real <span style="color:red" data-ts="2435.165" data-end_ts="2435.365" title="2435.165" id=c_"2435.165">__time__</span> sampling in any way. And then I had to have a mixer and a reverb and all this kind of stuff. So I <span style="color:red" data-ts="2439.965" data-end_ts="2440.045" title="2439.965" id=c_"2439.965">__end__</span> up with, it's like table full of stuff and Mark Moser goes out on tour and he's got, he's got an Octa <span style="color:red" data-ts="2447.325" data-end_ts="2447.525" title="2447.325" id=c_"2447.325">__track__</span> and a damn blow <span style="color:red" data-ts="2448.875" data-end_ts="2449.165" title="2448.875" id=c_"2448.875">__felt__</span> desktop unit, nothing else. He's set up in two minutes. It takes me an hour and a half to get it all running. And I'm just like, eh. So I bought myself an Octa <span style="color:red" data-ts="2460.125" data-end_ts="2460.285" title="2460.125" id=c_"2460.125">__track__</span> and I'm in the process of learning how to, how to integrate it into what I think of as performance. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>So maybe it's a little bit early to expect a definitive answer to that, but how, how do you think of, performance in that way? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I would say this, one of the things that I've, I've really come to understand with all of these systems, whether it's the MPC or the ESX or the loopers or whatever it is, is that the worst thing you can do is come to the table and say, I wanna work like X and this system has to follow me while I do that. Right. I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>See. So you're thinking <span style="color:red" data-ts="2499.205" data-end_ts="2499.285" title="2499.205" id=c_"2499.205">__of__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2499.285" data-end_ts="2499.445" title="2499.285" id=c_"2499.285">__as__</span> more, it's more an emergent property as it were. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2502.625" data-end_ts="2502.845" title="2502.625" id=c_"2502.625">__it__</span>, and it's an opportunity for me to learn. The people who electron, when they put together the Octa <span style="color:red" data-ts="2508.565" data-end_ts="2508.725" title="2508.565" id=c_"2508.565">__track__</span>, they weren't just stupidly making decisions. They would come to some fork in the road and say, well, in order to pursue what we wanna pursue, we have to take this leg of the fork. Right? Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Oh yeah. Of course. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's the same with the same with the MPC. It was the same with the ESX or with the loopers. Every one of them has some decisions were made in the development of the device. And it's an opportunity for me to learn about the decision making process that these people have done. Now, I would say that Electron is one of these peculiar companies where people seem to either just like totally get their stuff or be totally bollocked by it. And I would say for the longest time I was totally bollocked by it. But the nice thing for me is that, two things. I, first of all, I put myself in a position of having to use it. Secondly, I put myself in that position, but I didn't have to perform a Darwin Gross set. So I was invited by my friend, Wally, mother of sound system. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>They did a show way up in the mountains here in Colorado. It was a fabulous thing. You know, you drive for like an hour away from any humans and there's like, all of a sudden there's this camping spot with a PA and DJs spinning and all that kind of stuff. Right. And so what I did was, I took the Octa <span style="color:red" data-ts="2597.245" data-end_ts="2597.445" title="2597.245" id=c_"2597.245">__track__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2597.465" data-end_ts="2597.685" title="2597.465" id=c_"2597.465">__but__</span> I said, instead of doing my typical set, what I'm gonna do is kind of do what I call an enhanced DJ set. So it's some of my compositions in raw form and then some, some recorded material by other artists. So I focused on, people who are on the raster <span style="color:red" data-ts="2616.885" data-end_ts="2617.085" title="2616.885" id=c_"2616.885">__note__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2617.105" data-end_ts="2617.325" title="2617.105" id=c_"2617.105">__on__</span> label. Mm-Hmm. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b><affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And so it was a bunch of my work as a bunch of stems and little sequence bits and stuff that I would perform live, and then I would cross <span style="color:red" data-ts="2630.595" data-end_ts="2630.885" title="2630.595" id=c_"2630.595">__feed__</span> into this restaurant <span style="color:red" data-ts="2632.395" data-end_ts="2632.685" title="2632.395" id=c_"2632.395">__Oton__</span> stuff. And it was a fabulous experience because first of all, I didn't have to bring in my normal shtick. So I didn't even take the modular along. It was really a completely different thing. And so, because it, I didn't have to bring along all my normal baggage, I was able to approach the device on its own. And it was phenomenal. And I learned a ton. I learned how to negotiate their manual, which I had printed. And I still, every day when I'm doing my practice now, I pick some other thing, like, okay, today I'm gonna work on the LFO designer and how to make that a part of what I do. Right. And it just got to be part of my everyday practice routine. It's working out, it's becoming an instrument to me, which is really cool. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>There's a lot to think about there. And so maybe when we get to Podcast 200, we can kind of, go back over this again. 'cause this is, this is an extended and astounding story, but I would be really amiss if I didn't stop for a second and say as an example of an idea in practice or something like that, because there's a real practical aspect to what you're doing. Let's talk about the podcast itself, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? Sure. What do you <span style="color:red" data-ts="2708.085" data-end_ts="2708.245" title="2708.085" id=c_"2708.085">__wanna__</span> know, <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Why'd you do it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Again, I was, first of all, I didn't think anybody other than my coworkers were listened to it. So I, I didn't have any grand ideas. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Thanks for playing. Thanks for playing. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But, also, I had read this book called Trust Agents, and it was sort of like, one of the things they kind of point to is the fact that if you put, if you put yourself out there, people start viewing you as some sort of like, trusted person. And I was like, well, you know, that sounds interesting, but I have no desire to get out there and become a trusted guy. But I do like some of the ideas that say, Hey, talk to people and interview them and find out what they know and find out what they learned and all this kind of stuff. And so I was just like, you know, and I hate my voice. I've always hated my voice. It's this northern Wisconsin thing where when I hear myself, it sounds like I just fell off the potato truck. And so, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>I've <span style="color:red" data-ts="2771.125" data-end_ts="2771.205" title="2771.125" id=c_"2771.125">__always__</span>, you're thinking of up, you're thinking of up north boy 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Up north boy. Yeah. One of my, one of my alter egos. I'm, I've always been uncomfortable with my voice. And so I thought, you know, if I do this thing, if I just talk to people and if I interview 'em and record it, and then just share it with like the people at work and stuff, I'll get used to, I'll get used to working with my own voice and maybe I'll get rid of some of the vocal ticks I have now. I still have some of 'em. Every time I interview or every time I edit an interview, the number of times I say, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2801.065" data-end_ts="2801.285" title="2801.065" id=c_"2801.065">__oh__</span>, that's interesting is overwhelming. But 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Well, the people that you talk to say interesting things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's what I was just gonna say. What, what happened is something I couldn't have imagined. First of all, the first one I did, which was with Sam, Caucasian, I was really nervous. And I don't think he knew about it. And I don't think he cared whether I was nervous or not. He just thought it was a funny lark. And so I prepared this whole list of questions and, you know, I would basically interrupt him mid <span style="color:red" data-ts="2831.095" data-end_ts="2831.445" title="2831.095" id=c_"2831.095">__ideas__</span> so that I could throw the next question at him. And I listened to it and I was like, wow, that sounds very stilted. But I edited it down a lot and I, I made it so it flowed a little better. And then the next one I did, which was with Dan Nigra, and I also had a big list of questions, but he kind of of threw me for a loop because he started talking about some of his background stuff, and it was in all this analog heaven type stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And I kinda like jumped off the script because all of a sudden we're talking about stuff I was interested in and I couldn't stop talking enough. And then next thing I know, our time was done and I hadn't talked about my questions. When I'm editing it, it's like, wow, that was a lot better of an interview <laugh>. Right. And it was cool because Dan shared it with some of his friends, and now all of a sudden people outside of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_%2774">Cycling '74</a> were listening to this and they're like, oh, that sounds good. You ought to talk to this person or that person. And so I started following some trails around, and it was really cool. And it was going along. I would get like a hundred or 200 people listening to each podcast. And that was really neat. And then two things happened. First of all, I was supposed to do an interview with this guy who will never be interviewed because he, at the, at the very last minute, he kept on delaying. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And so, you know, it was like Thursday. And I'm like, man, I gotta get this in so I can get it edited and put out. And he's like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2913.525" data-end_ts="2913.725" title="2913.525" id=c_"2913.525">__oh__</span>, I, you know, I, I'm really working on this thing. I have to do it. Can we do it on Friday? So I'm like, okay. And then Friday comes, oh, I can't do it. Can we do it on Saturday? Can we do it Saturday night? Can we do it Sunday morning? Finally, Sunday morning comes and I always post Sunday by noon, right. Sunday morning comes and he's like, yeah, I'm not gonna do it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b><laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. I'm like, well, thanks man. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Thanks a lot. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Really. So just on a whim, somebody who I knew would be online and I knew would react to me. I, I shoot a male out to Julian Bale and I'm like, I am under the gun. Can I interview you? He's like, I feel weird about my English. I'm like, I feel weird about my English. Let's go <laugh>. Right. And so we just did it and I didn't have any time to do any kind of quality edit on it or anything. And he just, we just kind of talked about where he was coming from because I didn't have a chance to prepare any questions. So he just talked about where he came from and what he was doing and how he, you know, how hard he worked to get the expertise and the things that he was into. I went back and I listened to it and I'm like, I'm not gonna edit a thing. I'm not gonna edit out the s and haws 'cause I don't have much time, but it doesn't matter because all of a sudden this came across as really human, right. And instead of being an interview, it was a discussion. I was really caught by that. And that was something that at that point I stopped preparing questions and instead I, I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Think that's, I think that's the thing that, that your podcast to me anyway, fairly consistently delivers first. If there are people that I know, I always discover something I'm surprised about. But moreover, it's really difficult to leave almost any podcast you've ever done and not have a sense that you know something about the person. You've, you know what I mean? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, absolutely. And the other thing that I realize is by not having prepared questions, I was put into position of having to listen very closely to what people were saying. Where if I've got a list, I mean, and you see this when you see people interviewed on TV or whatever, right? The interviewer will ask a question and the person starts asking it, and you see the interviewer looking down at his notes and checking off, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3048.485" data-end_ts="3048.725" title="3048.485" id=c_"3048.485">__yeah__</span>, I asked this question and stuff like that. And you realize, oh, someone prepared a list of questions. They could care less what this person says in the interview. Right. Well, I realized I'm talking to all these people, many of which I would claim to be sort of my heroes. Yeah. I gotta do more than just look at my piece of paper with my questions. Right. I have to engage with them because they're gonna talk about stuff that I'm into anyway. So it's not like it's gonna be hard to talk about it. That was a revelation to do. That was a big, big deal that changed the, the tone of the podcast and meet it. What I think is a much, it turned it to me from being a podcast into kind of an oral history thing. And so that's kind of, when I really think about it, I think that the legacy of the podcast is actually that it captures the oral history of a time in a, in a certain kind of artwork. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>I think that's, I think that's entirely fair. The other thing that you're being really, you're, you're being really self-effacing about and sitting here in front of the microphone on this end of things, it's really complicated to actually only have one question and then try to figure out how to listen and to follow a story. Because my discussion with you has twisted in ways I would never have imagined in a billion years. It's a little scary. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Right. Well, I, but there again that, I mean, isn't that just the case with humans in general? Isn't that case with everybody that you know, that the more you know about them, the more fascinating they are? The more you know about 'em, the more you want to know about 'em. Yeah. I think in a way that's true. It's why I, I try to never call these interviews because the last thing I want is for these to be interviews. I want them to be a discussion about a person's life. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>And here's the other thing that I think, not to spend all of my time praising the program now that we're on this line <span style="color:red" data-ts="3168.665" data-end_ts="3168.885" title="3168.665" id=c_"3168.665">__of__</span> listening <laugh>, but here's one of the other things that I think is really interesting about the work that you've done. And that is you get people to talk about things that they loved. Yeah. And you've also been really generous about allowing them to proceed in some off direction in the name of talking about the thing they love. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I like interview very few politicians, <laugh>. 'cause I'm not interested in what they do. Right. I'm not interested in, like, I probably wouldn't do a promoter, right. Because even though a promoter works in the area of media arts and stuff like that, I'm not really interested in what they do because to a large extent, it seems like a glorified par party planner. Now I know promoters would beat me up for saying that, but I have trouble imagining myself being interested. Now, the, the fact is, you know, some people like this mother sound system. I would love to hear the process they put together to make this very personal and unique experience. Right. I don't really want to know about the guy who puts together Coachella 'cause I don't care. I have the luxury of picking my, of picking the people I'm gonna talk to. So that helps a lot. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? I pick people that are interesting to me. I'm interested in what academics do because teaching this stuff to people and teaching the next generation of people that are gonna make the music I love, that's pretty interesting. Or teaching the people who are going to be setting off on the brave new world of, video artwork in the 21st century. That's amazing to me. And I love hearing about it. I love knowing about it. I love knowing what artists do and how they do the things they do. I love hearing about inventors that build a thing. All that stuff is really interesting to me. So, you know, I I luxuriate in my ability to choose who I'm gonna talk to. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>There's a real sense in which to me, you're, I'm thinking about your idea of the podcast as a snapshot of a time. The thing that's interesting about that comment to me is that I think that's an emergent property. Oh, sure. You didn't start out thinking of yourself as a curator. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>No. In fact, I I would've been, I would've never done it if I would've thought that that was part of the job. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>And actually, you might find curators sort of boring to talk to. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, yes and no. I mean, I recently interviewed Ben Griswold and he does, he does like design for museum pieces, right. And I am, I'm not a designer. It kinda makes me a little scared to even think, you know, I don't want him to say, well, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3325.725" data-end_ts="3325.845" title="3325.725" id=c_"3325.725">__I__</span>, as I'm sure you learned in first year art, the blois flir is, ever present in our work. And I would be like, yes, sir. What you saying? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b><laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. But, you know, I mean, it's, it is interesting. I mean, some of this stuff is kind of interesting. A big part of it though too, is you notice I very seldom ask people to tell me about like, you know, what are the best examples of the thing you do? Because that, that ends up being really too tightly aligned to me being, you know, I would have to be interested in the subject to know that. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>Hmm. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Where in some 
</p>

<p>
<b>Gregory: </b>You, I've, you're right, you've, I don't think I can think, I don't think I can remember you ever asking somebody, right? That <span style="color:red" data-ts="3373.685" data-end_ts="3373.965" title="3373.685" id=c_"3373.685">__kind__</span> of question. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, because if for no other reason, I mean, I wouldn't, my taste changed too. So for example, I may not like a certain artist's current output, but that doesn't mean that their work isn't important or timely or part of our milieu. It's just, I personally don't happen to like, some of their content right now. That doesn't mean I don't want to know about how they became an artist or how they did work that I liked before. Or maybe I would find out that six months from now I'd grow enough so that I really like their work that they're doing right now. <laugh>, you know? And so I don't wanna be pejorative about anything because my tastes changed rapidly. I want to be able to kind of go with that flow, but also not always assume that where my head is at today is truth. Right? I just like thinking that I'm part of a continuous flow, that everything around me is emergent, so I need to be as well. And there you go. That's at least part of my story. I hope that you found it interesting. Thanks a lot to Gregory Taylor for both pushing me into doing this as well as serving as the mc for the project. I want to thank everyone again for their support in the Kickstarter campaign and also for their support in listening to this podcast number 100. I can't believe it's here, but, there you go. Number 101 starts next week. I hope that you'll tune in again, and thank you so much for listening. Bye.
