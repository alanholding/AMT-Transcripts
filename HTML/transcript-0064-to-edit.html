<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, this week it is my great pleasure to introduce someone that was on kind of my, if you would call it bucket list for people to talk to. It's Keith Fullerton Whitman an artist whose work I respect so much, and who's, I've been, whose work I've been following, it seems like forever. I'm really excited to have him on the podcast. And so with that, we'll say hello to Keith. Hi, Keith. How are you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith Fullerton Whitman: </b>I'm good, Darwin Thanks for calling. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thanks for, for being willing to do this. It's, it's really awesome. For those of the listeners who might not be, super familiar with what you're doing, why don't you kind of give us a little self-identification? Tell us, who you think you are. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Ooh, who I think I am. Okay. Well, let's keep it short. I, yeah. I always just self-identify as a musician. I mean, I, I love that, the simplicity of that and the fact that I can really encompass anything involving with music or sound. But, yeah, for the last say like 20 years, it's almost exclusively been electronic music. And I kind of tend to diversify a little bit and approach between, <span style="color:red" data-ts="82.67" data-end_ts="82.96" title="82.67" id=c_"82.67">__yeah__</span>, doing things in software, doing things in computers, and then doing more tactile, live realtime circuit based things, but not really, you know, I, I, I sort of feel like a slave two masters sometimes. I like that it's, it's didactic. I like that there's like sort of two ways that I can approach music, but ultimately get similar results, but by going about completely different means. And I think that's really maybe a core idea of, of what I would've been doing for the last, so last few decades. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I mean, the, the music that, that I listen to of yours, the current stuff I would say is experimental, but it seems like it's not really peculiarly, experimental. A lot of it is quite approachable. I hate to, I hate to, like corner people into sort of like labels, but I think it's always helpful to just kind of, you know, suggest what kind of genres you consider yourself to live in. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Sure. Yeah. That's, I mean, when I, when you say the word experimental music, in my mind, I dunno if this is universal, it's just the way that <span style="color:red" data-ts="146.24" data-end_ts="146.32" title="146.24" id=c_"146.24">__I__</span> framed it. But for me, that refers to like a tradition from the sixties. <span style="color:red" data-ts="150.46" data-end_ts="150.68" title="150.46" id=c_"150.46">__It__</span> may be, you know, the mid seventies at the latest. Absolutely. Right. Nothing later than that. That's like a style of music that started in the early sixties and ended in the mid seventies. Now, a lot of my own listening habits, the things that I'm inspired by, the things that I think about tend to come from that generation shore. You know, I, I'm not like blinders on focused on this era, you know, but I, it really is, I mean, I think it's a large part of my musical upbringing and I can't help but reference it. So, as far as contemporary, what we'd call so-called experimental music, I think it actually refers largely to things that hinge on these traditions that are actually backwards looking. That's sort of, you know, they aren't experimental in practice as much as emulative, you know, and Right. Or, you know, maybe they, they combined elements of things from the past. But, you know, contemporary music, like as in, you know, the 21st century or the late 20th century that is purely experimental is I think, few and far between. There's very little of it, you know, everything is always so evocative and, you know, it, directly correlates to something else, you know. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That's an interesting thought. Well, and it's funny to think in terms of experimental as actually being, having kind of a time, time domain, but it's as, as soon as you said that, that certainly did register with me in that there was almost an immediate visual of like certain albums, and particularly album covers or certain performances that I've seen that, are completely, that they're not only, they're not only that kind of music, but they, they're, it's that kind of look and really that kind of lock into that specific era. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Sure. Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, it's just, it's a, a byproduct of my upbringing that I just, when I grew up, that the focus of the things, you know, I, ideas that I was first sort of, shown were, it happened to be, you know, like versions of these ideas that I'm interested in now all came from that era and time. So that's, obviously, there are precedents to everything, and there's people that tend to reinvent certain ideas and in amazing ways. But just as far as the way my brain works, I'm, I'm almost, you know, always thinking of this point in time, you know, for these points in time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. Well, let's talk about, your background. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, it's one of the things I like to do on the podcast. I like to talk to people about how they got to be the, the artists or musicians that they are. And in your case, it'll be really <span style="color:red" data-ts="290.44" data-end_ts="290.6" title="290.44" id=c_"290.44">__kind__</span> of interesting because you do your, your practice because you work with both, hardware and software, is a really interesting mix and dynamic mix of stuff. I'm curious where you came from, what, what is the background that got you to be the musician that you are? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Okay. Well, let's see. The, the earliest point that's interesting would be, you know, I grew up outside of New York City in a, you know, a New Jersey suburb. Both my parents worked in the city and a very sheltered, you know, really great place to grow up. But, I, you know, my first experience exposure to music was actually almost exclusively, you know, listening to records and, and going to garage sales and finding LPs and, you know, going in the real classic, you know, this is <span style="color:red" data-ts="333.28" data-end_ts="333.36" title="333.28" id=c_"333.28">__what__</span>, this would've been the late seventies, early eighties, that going that route of discovering music that way. You know, I think I found a, a trouser press or a, you know, a Rolling stone, you know, guide to music from the seventies book at a garage sale. And I went through richly trying to listen to all the music that I could. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>And then, when I first started getting the idea in my head to make music, I mean, I had absolutely no instrumental ability whatsoever. I'd taken a few guitar lessons, you know, I'd played flute or, or clarinet in the school orchestras, but poorly, you know, and, I had, you know, both of my parents were programmers and I started like, I don't know, like fooling around with making sound on computers. And at the time, this would've been like a, you know, Commodore 64 Atari, 800 tar s t, that kind of stuff. And just really rudimentary chip sound stuff that you could do with computers at the time. So really, like the first things that I did that I was happy with, that were music, were actually already computer music, this, you know, and this is the early eighties, and I think I just, like, I stuck with the idea of, of, you know, just making sound that way and, you know, organizing sound that way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>And way before I really had the idea of, being in a band or, you know, being social with music or, you know, playing in groups with different people, which I did later on, you know, when I was in high school and college. But, yeah, I always, like, I, I think back to that idea of just sort of being alone and, and, you know, in the suburb in my own room with my computer, and spending eight hours to make, you know, 30 seconds of some <span style="color:red" data-ts="411.42" data-end_ts="411.84" title="411.42" id=c_"411.42">__combin__</span> combined sound and how gratifying that was, and that, that level of detail, this non-real <span style="color:red" data-ts="416.4" data-end_ts="416.52" title="416.4" id=c_"416.4">__time__</span> way of working afforded you. And I think, you know, in a way, what I'm doing now is so different from that. It's almost exclusively real time, right? Like, decision <span style="color:red" data-ts="424.4" data-end_ts="424.72" title="424.4" id=c_"424.4">__based__</span>. But, I just, something about the idea of that is like, I think one of the most powerful ideas and, and electronic music is the way that you can actually work in a completely atemporal way. You can just, you can expand and contract time as much as you want, and to make, you know, obviously whatever you're listening to is gonna be a real time experience, but the amount of time that went into it can be more or less than it takes for you to make it in the first place. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>So yeah. That's a, that's a long rant, but <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, no, it's, it's not, it's actually, it's actually pretty interesting. But, I think, I think it is interesting that the thing that kind of drew you into doing this kinda work was the solitary and sort of like, well, the solitary nature of it. And now you are doing so much, you are so much known now for doing live performance. Mm-hmm. <span style="color:red" data-ts="473.98" data-end_ts="474.2" title="473.98" id=c_"473.98">__Yep__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What, first of all, what, what was it about the solitary work that, that you liked? I mean, I, I know for myself, there were two things that are, that were kind of equally powerful. One of 'em was the ability to say, I control everything in my domain. So it was a little, sure, <span style="color:red" data-ts="496.96" data-end_ts="497.08" title="496.96" id=c_"496.96">__yeah__</span>. It was a little power mad, right? <span style="color:red" data-ts="498.83" data-end_ts="499.12" title="498.83" id=c_"498.83">__Yeah__</span>. But there was also this sense of I didn't have to be embarrassed about making a mistake in what I was doing. And so I, I really, it provided a lot of freedom to experiment with things where if I was writing for a band or a group or something like that, I would've, I would've felt like I had to be, it was my responsibility to be more careful. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Yeah, absolutely. I mean, all of your formative music making experience is all about confidence building. It's all about, you know, you know, defining not just like defining yourself, but like coming up with something you feel comfortable with. And, you know, developing a language, language, a lexicon of techniques and ideas that you wanna explore. You know, and obviously you can, you can go in a million different directions when you're younger, you're not really sharing things with people. I mean, this, this <span style="color:red" data-ts="543.88" data-end_ts="544.04" title="543.88" id=c_"543.88">__is__</span>, I mean, I, I, I can't say across the board, there's a certain personality type that I've discovered, you know, working with electronic music. But I definitely see a commonality o of a of people that, you know, started out and really just spent ages trying to find themselves and, you know, making a lot of mistakes, but not really having to share them with anyone. You know, not having to <span style="color:red" data-ts="562.11" data-end_ts="562.4" title="562.11" id=c_"562.11">__area__</span> your mistakes publicly, not having to, you know, work with lots of other people that will sort of like casually judge you or whatever you want. You know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="568.64" data-end_ts="568.8" title="568.64" id=c_"568.64">__we__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="568.8" data-end_ts="568.92" title="568.8" id=c_"568.8">__we__</span> wanna call it, it's sort of this way of working where you can kind of, yeah, you can really fool around a lot and, and really mess up a lot. And then eventually you land on something that you feel good about, and then you hone that and you go forward from there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I'm curious about, what it is that drew you to the electronic part of music originally. So, you know, you kind of talk about having, having like run across a trouser press or something, and then gone and dug into it. But what was it that you found alluring initially? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="599.1" data-end_ts="599.32" title="599.1" id=c_"599.1">__Oh__</span>, it was just this other world lead tams, you know, it was really, there's no way to understand electronic music until you get into the instruments that are making this stuff, or, you know, the techniques that are being used. And I think I just, I heard tape music when I was really young. I don't know how I got lucky. I got some, what did I get? Probably one of those limelight compilations or, you know, Pierre Schaeffer <span style="color:red" data-ts="619.13" data-end_ts="619.48" title="619.13" id=c_"619.13">__peony__</span>, something like that when I was young. And it just, like, you know, it took me for ages to wrap my head around it. I just had absolutely no idea what was going on. I didn't, didn't really understand tape. I didn't really understand, you know, how that was even possible. And then it just, it took me ages of reading and doing research, going to the library. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>I mean, luckily, the, the suburb that I grew up in had this totally fantastic library, and I could read about this stuff. And then it just, the more that I got interested in it, the more it became, I mean, it was a bit of an obsession then, and very much still now, like early electronic music and all this kind of stuff. But, I don't know. It's just, it's hard to say why you fall in love with the things that you fall in love with. You know, there's these little <span style="color:red" data-ts="656.62" data-end_ts="656.84" title="656.62" id=c_"656.62">__in__</span> quantifiable differences between all the different kinds of music. And you just, you, you know, your, your blood starts pumping a little bit faster. It's something, you know, versus something else. It's just one of those things, you know, it's one of those majesties of life, you know, you can kind of just react to things as, as you experience them, and not really have to think too much about it. You just revel in the, your own reactions to them. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. I, I think it's actually interesting too, to, to think about it in terms of, of learning about the instruments as being a part of embracing the music. I, you know, I often wonder, like back, I happened to be a really young, young boy when my uncle brought home an eight track tape of switch on Bach, right? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And I remember that almost more intriguing than the music itself was the picture of this huge device on the front of the eight track tape <laugh>, you know, not as cool as the 12 inch desk, but still, it was cool to see, and it was, I, I think that the picture of the big pile of gear was almost as exciting as listening to these, to these pieces of <span style="color:red" data-ts="727.18" data-end_ts="727.4" title="727.18" id=c_"727.18">__bog__</span>. And I wonder to what extent that doesn't, that isn't something in, in a world where we're pretty fascinated with, with all things technology. I wonder if there isn't a certain amount of electronic music remains vital because people, like to embrace the idea of, of gear as being involved in the, in the definition or in the creation of this music almost a, a required component. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Yeah. I mean, that's definitely a large part of it. It definitely was a large part of my fascination when I was young. I mean, I was that kid, you know, I was 10 years old writing and getting, you know, a Synclavier catalog sent back to me in the mail, and I <span style="color:red" data-ts="766.68" data-end_ts="766.76" title="766.68" id=c_"766.68">__would__</span> just pour over the photos of them, you know? Right. I mean, obviously I couldn't, these things were completely inquirer, you <span style="color:red" data-ts="772" data-end_ts="772.08" title="772" id=c_"772">__know__</span>, they were just complete vapor 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>For, they cost more than two houses. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Yeah. There were like $40,000, and the worm drive was another whatever of $10,000, you know? Right. But they, you know, they, it was just this idea that these people were doing these building these, you know, institutional instruments that were, you know, superhuman. Like, well beyond my capacity, you know, this was like NASA level stuff when I was a kid. I just couldn't comprehend any of it. And of course, they came in these beautiful cabinets and, you know, they're, there were furniture. It was like this, you know, equivalent of collecting, you know, Danish modern furniture now was like you seeing these beautiful instruments that were, you know, that were kind of these fetish objects, you know, that you really couldn't avoid that. You know, there were these magical mythical things that sure, they made sound at some point down the line, but, you know, as objects, there were just totally covetable things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>And even having access to them was completely alien. You know, I didn't have a college near me that had an electronic music program. I mean, I didn't even have a synthesizer until I was probably 16 or 17. You know, I, I didn't have access to that stuff. I maybe got a cassio and like a, you know, like a CZ one and a, a <span style="color:red" data-ts="831.2" data-end_ts="831.4" title="831.2" id=c_"831.2">__rolling__</span> drum machine when I was 16 and a cassette forward track, you know? Right, right. And that was, you know, and that was like what I could barely scrape by to, you know, to get with my paper out money or whatever. But, yeah, that even that, like, the sort of like the consumer version of it was still totally fascinating and, and hard to come to terms with, and, you know, just spend ages, I mean, ages every day I would come home from school and just either, you know, play guitar for three hours or make a single drum beat, or try to make a rudimentary song. I was just absolutely obsessed with it, you know? And then, you know, of course this was a great time. You know, this was the, the mid eighties and all of that sort of like underground tape trader kind of culture was happening simultaneously. And, you know, it was, it wasn't until I got to college, you know, when I was 18, that I kind of discovered all of that, and I got really into that whole world of, you know, kind of underground cassette music, male art kind of thing. You know? Did 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You really, I, I am fascinated by how widespread that was. So I would say that of the people that I, that I've talked to already, for the podcast, I would say half of them in some way were influenced by the ca cassette trading culture. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Oh, yeah. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Were you a person that, that was active in making, or did you just mostly, kind of get into the trading part? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>It was half and half. I mean, I definitely, I definitely made, you know, one-off cassettes of just awful music just to, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="914.24" data-end_ts="914.4" title="914.24" id=c_"914.24">__no__</span>, I mean, obviously I thought it was great at the time. In retrospect, it was, you know, whatever <span style="color:red" data-ts="917.64" data-end_ts="917.76" title="917.64" id=c_"917.64">__I__</span> would <span style="color:red" data-ts="917.84" data-end_ts="918.08" title="917.84" id=c_"917.84">__advise__</span>. But, yeah, I definitely, I, I liked the idea that there were people working in isolation that would never, I mean, I would never hear about them otherwise, you know, I would, they would just, they were purely in it for this sort of meager returns in their investment. Sure. But they would just find kindred spirits across the board. It was all about finding other people like them <span style="color:red" data-ts="935.26" data-end_ts="935.48" title="935.26" id=c_"935.26">__in__</span> other small towns with similar gear and similar ideas, similar influences. And, you know, it was like they had no delusions of grandeur. That was really the best thing about it. It was just totally this self-sustaining, very small thing that was just, you know, you got the energy out of it, you put into it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Right. And even now, like, what a beautiful idea that is. You know, that's just, it's nothing that has anything to do with marketing or, you know, selling anything. It's just, you know, purely music for music's sake, you know? So very romanticized idea. Sure. But at, you know, at the time, it was very powerful. I was being, you know, groomed to go to music school, and there was already this, this whiff in the air of like, you know, commerciality and learning how to do something and, you know, joining Prince's band if you were really good or whatever, something stupid like that. But, you know, an alternative to that was there was this very much this palpable community of people that just were happy making things and, and having, you know, a couple of people like them hear them, and that was it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, I think that also it, I mean, first of all, there was this like weird communities developing on that. And so, one of the things I got into at one point, recently, I, I had done my master's, degree. And one of the things that I had, I actually did some kind of deep research in before I abandoned it, was not only the cassette trading culture, but also then the magazines related to the culture and little subcultures and what became almost nano cultures, you know? Sure. Yeah. It's like the space music that's not new age, you know, and is, you know, like from, if they make this little box for themselves so that the, the 20 or 30, newsletters that you'd print up was pretty much the whole world of people interested in that genre. Right. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Yeah. It's, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1042.72" data-end_ts="1042.84" title="1042.72" id=c_"1042.72">__I__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1042.84" data-end_ts="1042.96" title="1042.84" id=c_"1042.84">__mean__</span>, yeah. So not to cut you off No, go ahead. Getting into this. Yeah. That idea of that sort of cosmic, whatever <span style="color:red" data-ts="1049" data-end_ts="1049.08" title="1049" id=c_"1049">__you__</span> wanna call that at eighties, kind of not quite progressive rock, not quite Berlin school, not quite minimal synth, you know. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1055.54" data-end_ts="1055.76" title="1055.54" id=c_"1055.54">__It__</span>, they were calling it eMusic at the time, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>E <span style="color:red" data-ts="1058.4" data-end_ts="1058.52" title="1058.4" id=c_"1058.4">__music__</span>. Right? Of course. Yeah. Yeah. This was, we used to read what, like synapse and what was Archie Patterson had a magazine or <span style="color:red" data-ts="1064.29" data-end_ts="1064.64" title="1064.29" id=c_"1064.29">__Yurok__</span> or something like that. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1065.44" data-end_ts="1065.76" title="1065.44" id=c_"1065.44">__Yurok__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1065.94" data-end_ts="1066.16" title="1065.94" id=c_"1065.94">__is__</span> one of 'em that I ended up reading a whole bunch of back issues on it. It was just fascinating to go through that stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Yeah. And this is, I mean, it's amazing that we have a, a really rampant problem with like micro, genre, you know, classification right now with electronic music. But back then, I mean, even like, people basically using exactly the same equipment with exactly the same influences, making pretty much identical music, could still kind of, you know, compartmentalize it. You know? And, you know, this isn't coming out of this European tradition. This is a uniquely home spun American version of this thing, and then we'll call it something else. You know? It's, I found that, I mean, at the time I was aware of it now, I find it totally fascinating. 'cause <span style="color:red" data-ts="1102.68" data-end_ts="1102.76" title="1102.68" id=c_"1102.68">__it__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Yeah. Well, the other thing is, I think at the time, everyone involved really wished that there was something like the internet where there was sort of like an anonymous way to very rapidly disperse your music to as many people as wanted it. And I think now that we kind of have that, everybody looks back and thinks, man, what a cute thing to be able to like, package up a cassette in a box and personally send it to another person. It's, it's almost like at that time, everything had to be so personal that it was kind of a drag. But now with the age of almost like frictionless distribution, the, the desire for a little gift to show up in the mailbox is actually kind of, I, I wonder if there isn't gonna be a re resurgence of something like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Yeah. I mean, that is still a great feeling. I mean, I'm, I'm an avid, you know, well into my forties, I'm an avid, record collector, and I get, you know, a, a mailbox, you know, a moment every day, you know, where I get, you know, what can I clearly see from two blocks away as an LP mailer, as I approach my office, and I get that little surge of adrenaline, you know, it's like, what is it gonna be today? You know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>I, it's, this is, you know, it's always gonna sound like a outmoded, way of thinking about music, but I'm still so invested in like, tangibility and things and, you know, all the idea of laying something out and having it look good and, you know, and all of that. That has such a, a huge importance to me. And back, yeah. Even back then in the eighties. Yeah. The idea that you'd make music, you know, but Sure. You still had to make something physical to send people in the mail. You still had to be an entity. You still had to be in address. You still had to be 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and, and, and you actually had to be able to find some way to get someone else's address too. Exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Right. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1204.06" data-end_ts="1204.28" title="1204.06" id=c_"1204.06">__And__</span> going back to some of these old newsletters, one of the most fascinating parts of it was the people who would send their cassettes in to be reviewed solely so that their names would get printed and people would include them in their trading circle. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Right? Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And it was fa it's fascinating to look back at that and to see, how people just had such a desire for, for developing community and developing those, that social network, even if the infrastructure wasn't necessarily easily put in place. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now talking about sort of like the physical entities and the excitement that comes with it. Fact of the matter is you are, you are personally involved in the distribution of shiny objects mm-hmm. <affirmative>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1256.96" data-end_ts="1257.08" title="1256.96" id=c_"1256.96">__yeah__</span>. Through, mineral glue music, sales, first of all, excellent name. I was introduced to Memoral Glue sometime ago. And, just, just even the name for me represents, you know, gives me a, a great mental picture of what, what kind of work you're working on <laugh>. Sure. So, great choice. But, beyond that one, first of all, is it a label? Is it a distribution company? Is it a little of both? What exactly are you doing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>You know, it started out as just like a shop, you know, a web, a web shop, just to see if I could do it. You know, it was, I, I actually had been working for a distributor called <span style="color:red" data-ts="1294.72" data-end_ts="1294.96" title="1294.72" id=c_"1294.72">__Force__</span> Exposure here in Massachusetts for about five years. I was their, I guess, their sales manager. And, you know, I kind of like, I liked, I really liked working there, and I, and I loved all the people there, and, and I learned so much about that world. I mean, it was really like this five year crash course in sort of the independent arm of the music world, you know, the music industry. Right. But, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1313.44" data-end_ts="1313.56" title="1313.44" id=c_"1313.44">__I__</span>, I kind of like, you know, I had finished college and I was sort of not like stranded in Boston, you know, but, you know, I was here, worked doing the day job, and I really just wanted to do more with music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>And I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1322.48" data-end_ts="1322.6" title="1322.48" id=c_"1322.48">__was__</span>, you know, I was starting to take off every weekend and go to New York and play gigs and travel more. And it was like, not the kind of job where you could really travel for long periods of time. And it was basically running the whole, like, the store sales operation of it. So I quit in, you know, 2000, 2001, maybe I quit. And then, you know, I started touring and doing all that stuff for a few years. And then, you know, that kinda was good. I had a really good run <span style="color:red" data-ts="1342.68" data-end_ts="1342.84" title="1342.68" id=c_"1342.68">__of__</span> like, a couple years of doing that full time. And then, you know, I came back home. I wanted to spend more time with my friends and family and, just started <span style="color:red" data-ts="1348.62" data-end_ts="1349.04" title="1348.62" id=c_"1348.62">__minero__</span> to kind of keep a, a foot in that world of, of just keeping up with artists and friends that I've made. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>And, you know, the time I was living in this really great co-op house with, you know, four other people, we had this huge gigantic, you know, three floor complex right on the border of Cambridge and Somerville. Okay. And, you know, it was like a hotel. Like anytime there was like a, you know, a band come to town, they would stay at the house. 'cause we had spare rooms, you know? Sure. So this thing, magical thing happened where a band would come and they'd stay, and we <span style="color:red" data-ts="1373.36" data-end_ts="1373.52" title="1373.36" id=c_"1373.36">__cooked__</span> the breakfast, and they'd leave and they'd leave me three or four copies of their record, you know, and then the little box with three or four copies of the record turned <span style="color:red" data-ts="1379.64" data-end_ts="1379.8" title="1379.64" id=c_"1379.64">__into__</span> this whole shelf full of records that it turned into a room full of records. And then, you know, after a while, I had to get rid of this stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>So, you know, I, I, I taught myself p h p and my sequel and built a little kind of clergy website that barely worked. And then just sort of started doing it for fun. You know, you know, it's like, it's an easy thing to justify if you love music, you to sit and kind of write about things and, you know, try to communicate <span style="color:red" data-ts="1401.44" data-end_ts="1401.6" title="1401.44" id=c_"1401.44">__why__</span> you're so interested in things. It's really, it happens really naturally. So I just did it then. And, you know, I sort of did it, it was, you know, on and off the back burner for a few years there. And then finally in, I don't know, 2007 or 2008, it was like, the room of the house was completely to the point where it was like Tetris, you had to walk sideways, you know? Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1418.86" data-end_ts="1419.08" title="1418.86" id=c_"1418.86">__The__</span> boxes. And I moved into a, like a 650 square foot office in this loft, you know, loft, building, mill building. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>And, you know, I kind of moved my studio there and had the, the business there, you know, and had this really big room with really high ceilings. And I put up a, you know, multichannel sound system in there and continued to work there. But it was really more about, you know, having, you know, this dedicated space where I could go and just look at my temple, so to speak. I could go there and listen to music and work on things and, and do a little bit of writing and whatever I wanted. And, you know, the way to justify it was I had to have some sort of commercial entity. So, you know, I, I kept the shop going and really bumped it up and hired a guy to run it with me mm-hmm. <affirmative>, and it sort of, it sort of exploded around. Then around 2007, it got really, suddenly it was very successful for a few years, you know, five, six years. I, I was barely traveling and barely playing music, just really doing the, the business full time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What, what do you think caused the ex the explosion in activity? I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Don't know, it was just, it was a, a period in time where there was a lot of things happening. A lot of sort of scenes had collided in a really kind of neat way. I mean, I, I'd long been, obviously the fo my focus from my perspective was kind of like turning people <span style="color:red" data-ts="1485.74" data-end_ts="1485.96" title="1485.74" id=c_"1485.74">__on__</span> all this formative stuff. I really just wanted to know about obscure early electronic music and just being like, oh, you like this contemporary act and you'd really love this thing. This one record from 1973, that, guess what, someone just reissued it and, you know, let's carry that and let's talk about why this is such a powerful idea. You know, not necessarily like blowing up, you know, you know, showing like <span style="color:red" data-ts="1505.4" data-end_ts="1505.52" title="1505.4" id=c_"1505.4">__a__</span> precursors to things that were popular. I mean, that's not really the, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1508.2" data-end_ts="1508.52" title="1508.2" id=c_"1508.2">__that's__</span> something that I ever liked doing, but it happened a few times where, you know, I'd see some artist that was very popular and be like, this sounds exactly like this one thing, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Right. And, you know, and it's like, you, you should, I mean, you should always <span style="color:red" data-ts="1518.2" data-end_ts="1518.44" title="1518.2" id=c_"1518.2">__kinda__</span> be aware of, of things when there that happens, when there's like a, a precursor or whatever. But regardless, yeah, just, I just, you know, this is kind of cent noise scene happening, that kind of turned into kind of more of a broader electronic thing that was really, you know, very aware of that sort of music, Rett and those kind of styles, live electronic music, kind of people doing like very David Tud kind of things, but under the, the, umbrella of noise music. Right. And it got really interesting, and it's just, there was a huge community of people, of course. So, you know, where there's an audience, there's, it's, you know, you can kind of bring the audience for this contemporary thing into this interest and an older thing. And it was like a really beautiful time. So everything just lined up perfectly. And yeah, it was, it was really good for a while there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, that's, that's interesting. And it's still ongoing, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Oh, yeah, sure. I still do it. It's still, it's now it's right around the corner from my, my house here. And, you know, it's, it's very small now. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="1570.74" data-end_ts="1570.82" title="1570.74" id=c_"1570.74">__I__</span> moved into like a two room office above sort of like a jazz club. And, yeah, I do it. I mean, I really, it's like all my own records are there, and, and you know, the, the stock, obviously the shop is there and it's all crammed in this room, you know, and I go in there like, you know, two, three days a week and ship out orders and do updates every month and stuff like that. You know, I've been, for the last year or two, it's been my, my job job has been, you know, traveling and playing music and Right. Doing all that stuff. Not so much putting out records, but, you know, actually just like performing, which I, I've been really, really enjoying. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. We'll, we'll get to that in a second, because Yeah, yeah. You, you've got a hell of a history in performance. But before we get to that, I wanna talk a little bit more about, again, about your work with product. 'cause in addition to Miro <span style="color:red" data-ts="1612.08" data-end_ts="1612.28" title="1612.08" id=c_"1612.08">__Blue__</span>. Okay. Doing a little digging. I, and basically getting tweaked from a friend of mine who made the suggestion, there's this thing out there called Creole <span style="color:red" data-ts="1623.39" data-end_ts="1623.68" title="1623.39" id=c_"1623.39">__poem__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Oh, yeah. Okay. Crazy, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Crazy name. Which was sort of a C D R kind of label kind of distribution and kind of just, I mean, if, if anything, it sounds like music, music hacking, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b><laugh>. That's a good way of looking at it. I like that. Cultural, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Cultural, can you, yeah. Yeah. Cultural music, cultural hacking. What, can you explain a little bit about what, what it was and what your, what your efforts were focused on there? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Sure. Yeah. I mean, I suppose, I think we're coming up upon the, the 10 year anniversary of that starting. Yeah. It was May of 2005. So yeah, it's been 10 years February, so it's probably time for it to come clean on all of it. I mean, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1666.44" data-end_ts="1666.64" title="1666.44" id=c_"1666.44">__sort__</span> of have over the years, but, so basically we, you know, like I'm, I'm, you know, rabidly collecting this stuff, you know, this especially like regional obscure, electronic music without any sort of academic affiliation. That's kind of like the, the nexus of it. You know, I'm really interested in things that are, you know, inspired by, you know, the sort of academic electroacoustic music, but are sort of more maybe unique and personalized and, you know, right. Kind of coming from a different sensibility. So I started just finding like a, you know, treasure troves of this stuff just everywhere I looked. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>I'd, you know, everywhere I traveled, I'd ask if there were any interesting records from that place that were like this. And they'd be like, oh, there's this one record. You know, there's 10 sealed copies sitting over there for a dollar. 'cause nobody will buy it, you know? Right. And I would listen to 'em, and then it'd all be totally fascinating, you know? So I started just really hoarding these things and, you know, and then after a while it was like, you know, the people that I was living with at the time in the co-op house when we started, you know, they were all also very interested in this music. And we just like, started the idea of not so much like bootlegging them as like, making these, you know, print on demand kind of additions of them, you know, because it was like, the records, once people learned about them, they would just immediately skyrocket in value or whatever, you know, it was silly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Like literally records. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1731.56" data-end_ts="1731.68" title="1731.56" id=c_"1731.56">__I__</span> was buying 10 copies for a dollar, what, a year later be signed for a hundred dollars, whatever. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> after people would started talking about it. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="1737.16" data-end_ts="1737.32" title="1737.16" id=c_"1737.16">__it__</span> was something about that really irritated me. So I kind of wanted to have this Robinhood type gesture where you could, you know, not, not spend the a hundred dollars in the record. You could, you know, if you really wanted to hear it and you wanted to really look at the packaging and hold it in your hands, we would make this replica really like the, the model was like a replica, you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Know? Oh, okay. All 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Right. You know, I can't, I can't make you, an lp, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1754.76" data-end_ts="1754.96" title="1754.76" id=c_"1754.76">__right__</span>? I can't sit here and make you five, you know, like a one copy of an lp. It's impossible. But what I can do is make you a five 12 scale CD replica of this thing, you know, with all the original aesthetics intact, nothing revisionist about it, you know, just, here it is, here's the, here are the, you know, the front and the back of the lp. This is what the labels look like, and here's just a thing, you know, maybe I'll put it in the computer and I'll, I'll just remove the pops and clicks a little bit and clean it up. Right. But really nothing surgical, nothing, you know, to make it sound contemporary and just like, have it reenter the consciousness, you know, maybe have it just be something people will talk about again in a way that it, you know, with a couple decades of time between the, when the record came out <span style="color:red" data-ts="1790.37" data-end_ts="1790.72" title="1790.37" id=c_"1790.37">__while__</span> we're listening to it now, maybe now it makes sense in a way that it didn't in 1975, but now it makes sense. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>So to kind of, you know, just show all of these things that were happening, you know, the ideas that were just, you know, executed and forgotten about that were totally relevant now, and just wanted to show a variety of these. And then really, you know, it obviously got totally outta control for a while. I think <laugh>, there's like a, there's like maybe like 150 titles now, and it just keeps going. You know, people keep, basically, it's like a committee thing where this, it's like 25 of us now where people like, suggest things, you know, and then maybe somebody will find a record, something elusive somewhere in the world, and we'll like, do all the scanning and transcribing and stuff, and just send me the files and I'll, you know, make up whatever. I think the additions now are 27 copies or something like that, uhhuh. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>It's totally, totally minuscule. So, you know, and then like, half of those I give away anyway, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1836.12" data-end_ts="1836.28" title="1836.12" id=c_"1836.12">__so__</span> it's kind of like, you know, everybody involved in the, in the, the committee gets a copy of everything for free automatically. Right. So it's like, you know, it's basically, that's the gist of it. It's like this kind of fan club for this stuff. And then, you know, obviously to offset the cost of, in my time of making these things, which takes ages, I, I, you will sell <span style="color:red" data-ts="1852.28" data-end_ts="1852.4" title="1852.28" id=c_"1852.28">__to__</span> my memo loop. But it's like really, I mean, it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1854.2" data-end_ts="1854.32" title="1854.2" id=c_"1854.2">__a__</span>, I have to stress over and over again, and it's in no way a commercial adventure right <span style="color:red" data-ts="1857.88" data-end_ts="1858" title="1857.88" id=c_"1857.88">__now__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. Yeah. Well, I think that's fantastic because I, yeah, there have been a couple of times when I've been burned on both sides of that, either, you know, suggesting, oh, I remember this, this album only to see then, you know, a discussion start and three days later, the E eBay, a version of that is, has gone from 25 cents to, you know, a hundred dollars. Yeah. And then conversely, you know, catching wind of something only to find that because, because it's somehow, like you mentioned before, it, it, it, it was the precursor to something that's very current. All of a sudden it's just unobtainable. And, I think, I think one of the things for anyone that's, that, that is a musician of any sort, and particularly in electronics, there's, there's something to be learned by every ti, every opportunity you have to cast to the past and, and understand what people are doing. And like you said, a lot of times it makes more sense in, given, current or contemporary, sensibilities than it did at the time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Yeah, totally. I mean, there's a lot of amazing, you know, I, the, the card carrying example of this way of thinking I always like to use is Todd <span style="color:red" data-ts="1937.82" data-end_ts="1938.04" title="1937.82" id=c_"1937.82">__Doc__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1938.04" data-end_ts="1938.36" title="1938.04" id=c_"1938.04">__Studer__</span>, and I know most people know who Todd <span style="color:red" data-ts="1939.54" data-end_ts="1939.76" title="1939.54" id=c_"1939.54">__do__</span>. Studer is, he was working at a recording studio in New York, and he did, you know, some music for films and did some cartoon soundtracks and stuff <span style="color:red" data-ts="1946.2" data-end_ts="1946.32" title="1946.2" id=c_"1946.2">__for__</span> Gene Dy and stuff, but he was mostly like a, you know, a film industry guy. Yeah. But he, like, I mean, he just basically, you know, he had the studio, he would stay awake all night smoking cigarettes and making tape music. And, you know, he, he's, he's still alive. He lives like a mile away from here in, in a, in a, in a rest home. And I try to visit him every now and then, which, you know, it's hard to get in there, but I, I do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>And, he, but it's like, he's someone who I think is, like, his approach is so vastly different from any of the, the traditional European or Asian studio models. Like, he just, he had this way of making that music. It's, you know, obviously he's heard the G R M stuff and the N H K stuff and whatever, you know, the Italian r i I stuff, and he's kind of made his own version of it in such a unique way that it, for me, it almost even surpasses all of that stuff. You know, he's not part of a committee of composers all talking about ways to optimize production. He's just one man, like a one man army in the studio rewiring all the tape machines, so they run backwards and stuff like that to make a particular sound and doing it all himself. So it's like the most individualized version of that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>You know, I feel like when you listen to, I mean like, say early, V D R, you know, pieces, you know, Herbert Iert and Robert Byron <span style="color:red" data-ts="2013.62" data-end_ts="2013.84" title="2013.62" id=c_"2013.62">__and__</span> Vern Meyer and all that stuff, there's so much commonality in the, the tams across all these different composers work. And yet, you know, DocStar had, was collaborating with absolutely nobody. Yeah. And he just had this really beautiful, unique way of working. It just makes it so interesting, you know, and no one else before or after him did anything remotely like that, you know, that fleshed out. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Wow. Interesting. Yeah. I'm, I'm gonna have to do a little diving on that. That sounds fascinating. Yeah. Okay. So let's, let's talk a little bit about you as a performer, because mm-hmm. <affirmative>, I actually first ran across your work, under a different name. It was back in your, and I'm gonna probably say it wrong, but I'll just go with Herky. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Yeah. Herky iss fine. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Okay. <laugh>. I, I was introduced to that as, as sort of like the, the of its time, kind of aggressive dance or Yeah, I guess aggressive dance music. I, I would say aggressive in terms of pushing envelopes. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Sure. Yeah. No, it's definitely aggressive. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2080.52" data-end_ts="2080.76" title="2080.52" id=c_"2080.52">__Yeah__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Okay. That's aggressive. Yeah. And, you, you made quite a, quite <span style="color:red" data-ts="2089.12" data-end_ts="2089.32" title="2089.12" id=c_"2089.12">__an__</span> impact from there. How did you get from where, so how did, how did you get from like your, your bedroom and, you know, Commodore C 60 fours to being herky? What was the interim section there? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Okay, let's see. So I had, you know, when I was 18, I applied to all these colleges and, and, and I got into a few places, but I ended up gonna Berkeley because I had gone up there for like a summer, you know, like a preview visit. And I'd met Dr. B, who's Richard <span style="color:red" data-ts="2122.52" data-end_ts="2122.81" title="2122.52" id=c_"2122.52">__Boje__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. So we're talking Berkeley School of Music. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2124.85" data-end_ts="2125.09" title="2124.85" id=c_"2124.85">__Yeah__</span>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2125.09" data-end_ts="2125.25" title="2125.09" id=c_"2125.09">__Be__</span> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Berkeley College of Music Book. College of Music. Yeah. So, yeah. And he, you know, Dr. B wrote like the C Sound book mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And he's, you know, he's like there in the early days of C Sound with Barry Ko and stuff, you know, and I went there, I just really liked him, you know, he was like, he, he was, you know, part of that whole scene of like, you know, he was like friends with Alvin Luer and all those kind of like lovely music people and all that. Like, he knew that whole world really well. And I was really into that stuff, still am really into that stuff. And he was just like, he was making music and he was friends with Max Matthews, and he was friends with Bob Mogue and all these trusted people, you know, and he kind of just like, told good stories and I was like, this is where I should go, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>And I had a little bit of, they gimme a little bit of money to go there for the first year. So, so I went and I went there to learn, you know, to study computer music with him and to, to learn this stuff. And, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2167.6" data-end_ts="2167.72" title="2167.6" id=c_"2167.6">__I__</span>, you know, the first year I got to Berkeley was absolutely amazing. There was this guy, Tom Ray, I dunno if you've ever heard of this guy, R H E A, who taught the, you know, electronic music 1 0 1 class. Oh, yes. Right. Yeah. Used to work with like Raymond Scott and used to, you know, also used to work for Mogue and stuff. And, you know, he was also really fascinating early electronic music guy. And, yeah, just, you know, I went in there and I, and I started learning obviously Max, and, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2191.33" data-end_ts="2191.68" title="2191.33" id=c_"2191.33">__let's__</span> see, I would've learned a lot of C sound and maybe a little bit of Super Collider would've been starting around then. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>This is like, when I started, there was 91 or 92. All that stuff was kind of in its infancy. And, yeah, just, you know, you had the studio time where you'd <span style="color:red" data-ts="2205.88" data-end_ts="2205.96" title="2205.88" id=c_"2205.88">__sit__</span> these computers that were loaded with software and hardware around it and just do whatever you wanted. So I would make these kind of, you know, what I thought were academic leaning pieces. But then I started learning, you know, sequencers and learning how to use, jeez. It would've been Vision Studio, vision math tracks, or something like that, you know? Right. And, you know, this is right around, so 91, 92, you know, I was still very much like, I, I really didn't like dance music and really was <span style="color:red" data-ts="2230.64" data-end_ts="2230.76" title="2230.64" id=c_"2230.64">__not__</span> interested in it. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> 9, 4 95 maybe around then, like interesting things started to happen both in England and in the US There was more of like a, you know, jungle hardcore kind of thing was happening. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>And I just, like, from a production standpoint, that stuff started to get really interesting. The programming got really interesting. Sound design got really interesting. Right. And then around like 95, 96, it really got really, you know, super, like people were making dance music that had absolutely nothing to do with any sort of social connotations. It was purely this like anti-social boffin bedroom studio, <laugh>, like, you know, let's see who can, who can program the most complex thing or the most, you know, unusable thing, you know? And yeah, just really, that made so much more sense. There was a great dance music store right next to the campus called Satellite. And I would go in there and the guy would see me and he would just pull out the four records that didn't make any sense to him, <laugh> every week <laugh>, and give them to me, you know, and that would be whatever, it would be early Luke Viber or you know, early square pusher before he was square pusher, stuff like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>You know, it was like, you know, and then, you know, I knew nothing about that world at all. I maybe heard an Apex twin record and that was it. But I just like, I liked it and it was fascinating. And I, listening to that stuff, you know, and like dance music store with really loud sound system and just, it's impressive. So I was like, I'm gonna try to do this. I'm gonna try to program these cut up drums and stuff and, you know, but obviously knew nothing about that culture, knew nothing about the idea of drum breaks and, you know, barely know how to program <span style="color:red" data-ts="2307.86" data-end_ts="2308.08" title="2307.86" id=c_"2307.86">__to__</span> synthesize it or anything. So I just was making these really kind of cruddy sounding tracks, you know, live to da tape in the studio, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2316.27" data-end_ts="2316.56" title="2316.27" id=c_"2316.27">__head__</span> of studio vision, you know, using a Kurtz file sampler and just sort of, yeah, like sampling, you know, Tristan Zara and sampling Kurt Schwitters and stuff like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>'cause I didn't know, I was just like, I'm gonna make a, you know, I'll make this dance music track that samples all this, whatever, early 20th century sound push. It'll be funny. We'll see what happens. Yeah, right. It <span style="color:red" data-ts="2331.2" data-end_ts="2331.24" title="2331.2" id=c_"2331.2">__was__</span> like, it was like, it was a lark, it was like a thing, you know, try to do it and, and then yeah, just sort of like, I don't know, I, I, I did enough of it and I, and I got lucky in that I sort of, you know, I would go to see any kind of show that made sense of that world. I think I saw like that guy Third Eye Foundation. Yes. Matt Elliot. And I gave him, I gave, literally gave him a dat. I gave him 120 minute dat, <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>And then, like, you know, six months later, or three months later, whatever, I get an email from him that he's copied the DA and he's given it to a few people, you know? And then it went on from there. And I made all these connections in England, you know, like the guy that ran low records or Lee for one of those labels, like got in touch and I did like track <span style="color:red" data-ts="2366.72" data-end_ts="2366.92" title="2366.72" id=c_"2366.72">__four__</span> his compilations. And then like, I think somehow I met the mouse on Mars guys. Yeah. I went, I played my first show in Germany in like 98, and the Mouse on Mar Mars guys were there in Cologne. And I met them, and then we became really quick friends. And then slowly, that whole thing kind of, it was all very social. It was, you know, it was very unusual for someone in the US to be interested in that stuff. There was almost nobody in the US doing that stuff then. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Yeah. That's, that's a fascinating story, but also one that points out a fact that, that I think a lot of people miss and missed back then and, and still miss, which is the idea of not being shy about your work. I mean, nothing. Yeah. Nothing would've came of it if you hadn't kind of drummed up the, the, I don't know, the, the sense that you should give your tape your <span style="color:red" data-ts="2420.18" data-end_ts="2420.4" title="2420.18" id=c_"2420.18">__dad__</span> tape to people, let 'em hear what you're doing. I think that's, that's pretty fantastic. And especially since you weren't necessarily, you didn't necessarily have a career plan behind it, right. It was just the thing that you were, you were into now. So you went to Berkeley. Which of the programs were you at? Were you a performance or a recording or? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>I was, synthesis or music? Yeah, synthesis. Music synthesis. I still have a degree. I got a, I got a Bachelor of the arts <span style="color:red" data-ts="2449.44" data-end_ts="2449.64" title="2449.44" id=c_"2449.44">__and__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2449.64" data-end_ts="2449.8" title="2449.64" id=c_"2449.64">__and__</span> music synthesis. Oh, you good. Awesome. Which still involved, it still involved two years of, you know, doing proficiencies in instruments. So I had to play guitar. I had to do two years of, you know, showing them that I could play an instrument. I don't know if it's still like that at Berkeley, and this is, you know, over 20 years ago, but the time you had to actually go there and you had to actually be able to play an instrument, read music and all that stuff, to do anything, to get any kinda degree there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, 20, yeah. 20 years ago, they were unique because in an awful lot of places there wasn't even anything such as as music technology, period. I mean, they Sure. They were really blazing trails with a lot of that stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Yeah, it's good. It's, it's really good now. I mean, I don't have too many ties over there. I run into Mike Barilla every now and then. I run into Dr. B every now and then. Yeah. You know, Dr. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>B, he is, he is such a force of nature. It's unreal. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>He's amazing. He's still amazing. We did a q and a at, like an electronic music festival here in town over the summer. Uhhuh, that was the pan. The panel was Joe Paradiso. Do you know him? Yeah. He, he had the, the massive modular guy. Right. You know, he's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2508" data-end_ts="2508.12" title="2508" id=c_"2508">__the__</span> m <span style="color:red" data-ts="2508.28" data-end_ts="2508.36" title="2508.28" id=c_"2508.28">__I__</span> t and now I'm a totally amazing guy. It was him and Dr. B and I. And it was a great, like, just to hear Dr. B talk about now, he's super interested in all this <span style="color:red" data-ts="2517.2" data-end_ts="2517.68" title="2517.2" id=c_"2517.2">__eurorack__</span> small 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Format 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Stuff, and like how infectious he is with all that, you know, it's just so incredible. He's like, speaks like an excited child about it. It's really like, it's great to see somebody at an educational level that still has that passion for that stuff, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. And I think it's, I think it's almost unique. So often you run into academics that are 20, 30, 40 years into their thing, and all they can think about is, you know, thank God I have 10 years so I can kind of close to retirement. You're right. He is like, he's like a child on the day that the new Lego kits come out or something. Totally. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2553.46" data-end_ts="2553.68" title="2553.46" id=c_"2553.46">__You__</span> know, he just dances around. And every time I've met him, he just like, lights up the room. It's just amazing. Now, when you were there, you were, you were there with like, all of these people that have this significant history or had spent time with, with the history of electronic music. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, it must have been, given your background, given your sort of like desire to, to learn more about all of the, all these historical figures, did you, were you able to spend a lot of time kind of quizzing them? Or did you find that they were irritated talking about the history in that way? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>No, definitely not. They were, they were definitely, I mean, I definitely was experienced, exposed to it. I mean, Dr. B I think the first class I had with him, he, he turned off the lights and he played all of, I'm sitting in a room like straight through 45 minutes <laugh>. You know, and that was, I mean, possibly weeding out the, you know, a certain element. Right. But, you know, I mean, this was really, I mean, you know, there were kids in the class who maybe like nine inch nails would've been a thing that they would've been interested in trying to, to do. So there's a couple of like nine inch nails looking kids in there. But, but, yeah, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2620.14" data-end_ts="2620.36" title="2620.14" id=c_"2620.14">__the__</span> then <span style="color:red" data-ts="2620.84" data-end_ts="2621.04" title="2620.84" id=c_"2620.84">__lucier__</span> trick, as I like to call it, was a really great thing. So I'm sitting there, my eyes are getting bigger and bigger. I'm like, this is totally fascinating. I have no idea what this is. You know, I mean, I, I, you know, I knew a little bit of that, that music, but I'd never heard that piece before. Sure. Just to have it, like, to have it lights off, sensory deprivation, hearing that for the first time, like with other people and everybody looking outta the room and getting more and more afraid. And <laugh>, I'm kind <span style="color:red" data-ts="2639.24" data-end_ts="2639.36" title="2639.24" id=c_"2639.24">__of__</span> like, where's this going? You know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>You know, and then, it was, it was great. And then, you know, of course he's sitting up there with this huge grin, you know, when the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2646.96" data-end_ts="2647.08" title="2646.96" id=c_"2646.96">__piece__</span> ends and, you know, nobody has anything really constructive to say about it, but I'm just like, what was that and how did that happen? Right. And we, and it sort of opened up all these great dialogues about acoustics and the idea of, you know, how rooms can color sound and all this great stuff. And yeah, it definitely justified my decision to go there, you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Know? No doubt. No doubt. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Yeah. That's, that's, and it was like, you know, that first year I was there, it was like Max Matthews had like a, was there for a couple weeks doing giving talks. Bob Mogue came for a little bit to give talks. I think Braxton was there at one point. He came and played a concert. It was like really fascinating. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2673.94" data-end_ts="2674.16" title="2673.94" id=c_"2673.94">__It__</span> was all this interesting experimental music kind of just coming and going there. And I mean, plus the library there. The Berkeley Library is absolutely incredible. This the time was just <span style="color:red" data-ts="2682.84" data-end_ts="2682.96" title="2682.84" id=c_"2682.84">__kind__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2682.96" data-end_ts="2683.12" title="2682.96" id=c_"2682.96">__even__</span> John Voight was running it. I think he's still around, he's still like an improvising bass player guy. But you know, the, the, the, like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2689.12" data-end_ts="2689.24" title="2689.12" id=c_"2689.12">__they__</span> had all the Source magazine, Aspen, like all that kind of stuff was all, you know, you could just go and check them outta the library Wow. And sit there and read, you know. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. What, what a, what a secondary path through the education too. Not only, not only classes, but all of that to be able to, to dive into. That's amazing. So how did you make the move from Herky to the Keith Fullerton Whitman performance guy? Because, when I look at your discography, it looks like there's kind of an overlap. You started, you started doing releases under your own name while you were still putting things out as herky. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Was it just that you decided to do a different kind of thing and so, or maybe one that felt more personal? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Yeah. I mean, it's, it's weird to say now, but I, you know, like I've never really been all that invested in, in dance music. And, you know, it was like, when you do something that's really obviously a commentary or anything, it's not that thing. It's like, you know, herky was hinging so heavily on the, the lexicon of dance music and, you know, the need of need of those kind of sound systems, you know, and that kind of performance dynamic. But like, in no way was it functional dance music, right? It was really this thing subverting that energy, you know? And I, it really, it was very gratifying to me for do that, to do that for as long as I did. But it really, like, it really, when it died, it died in a really majestic way. I think the last 10 shows that I did, I just recorded the set from the back of the room. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>This is also hearkening, this luer story. You know, I, I would record the set from the back of like, whatever place I was playing, and then the next night I would just play the recording of the, set the room <laugh> and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2781.52" data-end_ts="2781.8" title="2781.52" id=c_"2781.52">__record__</span> the back of the room. So by the time I got to the end of this trip in like 2005 or something, it was like, you know, the last show was like in this cave in Austria, you know, <laugh>. And it was just this like, you know, massed room tone that had absolutely no semblance of the music, you know? And people were like, what are you doing <laugh>? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>What? This is not what we wanted, you know? And it was like, there's no contract <span style="color:red" data-ts="2801.36" data-end_ts="2801.56" title="2801.36" id=c_"2801.36">__saying__</span> that, you know, that you what you expect me to do, and blah, blah, blah. It was right. It was funny. It was a really funny time. And, you know, obviously it sent a very clear message that I was in no way interested in doing that anymore. But, but, yeah. And it, you know, I, the, the music I made under my own name that I make under my own name obviously, is, you know, I, I like the idea of using monikers for things that are, you know, I like a secondary idea, or you're, you're working outside of your comfort zones. That's kind of what that stuff is for sure. Sure. And it's not like <span style="color:red" data-ts="2824.24" data-end_ts="2824.36" title="2824.24" id=c_"2824.24">__I__</span>, you know, I don't condemn anybody that has like a, you know, a single, a solo artist that has a, you know, a moniker for their music. That's totally valid. I'm not against that, but it felt more kind of like transparent to, to do what was, you know, release records under my own name to have it be this, you know, this is what I'm interested in. And, you know. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right, right. Well, it's kind of interesting that, that the KY stuff started off being kind of a commentary on that kind of music. Yeah. And, ends up being, I, I mean, I remember seeing, you discussed in like Mixed Mag and, and some of these other, I mean yeah. Particularly the British magazines really seems to be like, totally, Hey, this guy's doing some crazy stuff. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Yeah. It's funny how that happened. It was really, yeah, it happened very naturally. Yeah. I think it was because, you know, I, I, I self released like a 12 inch when, when I started working at Forced Exposure. You know, I had, I had access to all this knowledge about how to make records and stuff. So right away I made a 12 inch, and then like a year later I made a CD and Okay. You know, just like working for a distributor that does a lot of import export, you know, that CD and the LP got out there, they really got out there. And I think it just like, you know, they landed in the right hands. And, you know, that was the time was like, pretty much the only way to get anybody to recognize your music was to physically put it on something and then get it out into the world. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>So yeah, I started getting a lot of shows in England. I don't know why. There was a very strong tie between Forced Exposure and some distributors in England, and that just copies were going back and forth for a while. And then, yeah, I started getting gigs in England. I just, I met, I'm trying to remember. I did, I did a bunch of like, remixes for people and they got a bit of attention. I did a remix for this guy, what was his name, kid? 6 0 6. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2920.52" data-end_ts="2920.64" title="2920.52" id=c_"2920.52">__I__</span> remember. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2920.8" data-end_ts="2920.96" title="2920.8" id=c_"2920.8">__It__</span> was <span style="color:red" data-ts="2921.04" data-end_ts="2921.12" title="2921.04" id=c_"2921.04">__like__</span> San Francisco guy. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2923.21" data-end_ts="2923.56" title="2923.21" id=c_"2923.21">__Right__</span>? I think he's still putting out records. He was really, really good back then. He was really great irreverent, kind of like <span style="color:red" data-ts="2928.98" data-end_ts="2929.4" title="2928.98" id=c_"2928.98">__really__</span> coming out of like harsh noise kind of thing, you know? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, but making that same kind of, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2933.54" data-end_ts="2933.76" title="2933.54" id=c_"2933.54">__you__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2933.76" data-end_ts="2933.84" title="2933.76" id=c_"2933.76">__know__</span>, irreverent dance music. And I did a remix for him, and it really got out there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>And then I got like, you know, within a couple of weeks of each other, I got emails from like, the guy that runs Planet <span style="color:red" data-ts="2943.22" data-end_ts="2943.44" title="2943.22" id=c_"2943.22">__Mu__</span>, you know, Mike <span style="color:red" data-ts="2944.05" data-end_ts="2944.4" title="2944.05" id=c_"2944.05">__Perus__</span>, the music. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="2945.78" data-end_ts="2946" title="2945.78" id=c_"2945.78">__Aix__</span> Twin sent me an email, and he was like, you know, they were both like, do you wanna do something for Reflex? Do you <span style="color:red" data-ts="2949.56" data-end_ts="2949.6" title="2949.56" id=c_"2949.56">__wanna__</span> do something for Planet <span style="color:red" data-ts="2950.26" data-end_ts="2950.48" title="2950.26" id=c_"2950.26">__Mu__</span>? Sure. I think at the time, that kind of music was really, you know, it was like, there was, like I said, there's, there weren't a lot of people doing it at a certain level of, you know, complexity. And I think they, you know, they kind of, those guys saw that at least I was trying to do something, you know, pushing it forward a little bit more. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I also think, yeah, I think that there was a sense too that, people had had access to the technology long enough to get over the idea of being just fascinated with using the technology. And actually were, were starting to push, push on the edges of genres in an in interesting way. And so anybody that looked, anybody that was kind of inscrutable, was also viewed as, well, maybe they're doing something that I need to understand. And so there was a lot of openness for that stuff at the time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Yeah. I mean, this is like, I mean, reflex put out a, a Robert Norman <span style="color:red" data-ts="3001.44" data-end_ts="3001.6" title="3001.44" id=c_"3001.44">__de__</span> cd and like, probably not that long after that, you know, it was like <span style="color:red" data-ts="3004.46" data-end_ts="3004.68" title="3004.46" id=c_"3004.46">__qua__</span>, you know, electroacoustic composer, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="3006.16" data-end_ts="3006.28" title="3006.16" id=c_"3006.16">__then__</span> they were putting out Hecker records and stuff like that. Right, right. So obviously they were interested in, you know, I wouldn't call that necessarily academic, but they were interested in that kinda more formal Sure. Electronic, you know. Sure. But yeah, you know, it was interesting how, I mean, I'm trying to think that, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3019.48" data-end_ts="3019.72" title="3019.48" id=c_"3019.48">__that__</span> on the same day in 2002, I put out the second and last Herky record and the first cranky record under my own name, literally the same day they came out on exactly the same day. And, you know, the, the Herky record completely tanked in 2002. It was like already way too late to do that stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Uhhuh <affirmative>. And then the, the cranky thing was just at the beginning of this curve of people kind of working with that, you know, this computer kind of standalone synthesis kind of systems that people used for a long time in the, in the two thousands, that kind of like textural guitar music, but having it be more of like an orchestra, you know? Right. Real time capturing and processing and looping, you know, that was right around the time. Like <span style="color:red" data-ts="3057.08" data-end_ts="3057.2" title="3057.08" id=c_"3057.08">__Fine__</span> was starting to do that stuff as well. Right. You know, he was, you know, probably like 2001, 2002. And it kind of became a thing for a little while. Like rock, you know, guitar players and rock people that like rock music were getting into this sort of, you know, live electronic music, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3070.54" data-end_ts="3070.76" title="3070.54" id=c_"3070.54">__you__</span> know, guitar based stuff, but, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, yeah. And so much, so much of guitar <span style="color:red" data-ts="3075.04" data-end_ts="3075.24" title="3075.04" id=c_"3075.04">__and__</span> a laptop as the performing combo, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Yeah. Yeah. You saw a lot, really, a lot of that from like 2001 to 2005. It was definitely, you know, and it creeped into this sort of rock consciousness in a way that was really fascinating. You know, and then like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3088.96" data-end_ts="3089.2" title="3088.96" id=c_"3088.96">__into__</span> the metal world as well, later on, it was kind of this metal, kind of loud guitar, heavy metal kind of thing as well, that was all computer based. And yeah, it was neat. It was kinda a really interesting time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, at that time, were you, what was your, you know, at, at that point, your quote job was already, touring and performing mm-hmm. <affirmative>. What did your performance rig look like at the time? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Were 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You strictly laptop, or were you, or were you carrying instruments? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>I think at first, just because to make, you know, the, the, the travel back and forth to Europe, really easy. I had a, like a Brenthaven backpack, and it just had maybe, you know, a MacBook and like, well, you know, the Power book they call 'em back then mm-hmm. <affirmative>, and then like a, a moto interface, one of those like traveler guitars and like a foot pedal, like, like a volume pedal. Okay. And a mini, and a mini controller. I used one of those evolution mini controllers for that back then to control Max, you know? Right. And, and that was it. It all fit in a backpack. And I would, I would wedge, you know, a a change of socks and underwear in there. Right. And that would be my weekend, you know, pretty much, you know, that would be, I would go over and, you know, go to England, play one show, maybe play a pickup gig, and then come back. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> and I did that, you know, probably once or twice a month for, geez, for five years. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Wow. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>So, and that was, yeah, that was my job. And I did a little bit of traveling domestically, you know, Greg Davis and I did a few tours in the US that were pretty long, that were very similar. Also, just computer, maybe some microphones, small instruments, but nothing that couldn't fit in the trunk of a car, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I've actually met a couple of people who have talked, have talked about seeing you and Greg, working together as having been really influential. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, what, what kind of places were you playing here in the States? When you were doing gigs or, or for that matter in Europe when you, were you doing club gigs or were you doing I'm, I'm trying to cast back that, that was kind of a dead time for me in terms of being out in the world. And so I don't even know what the environment was like in, in, say, 2005 or 2006. What was, what was the performance like? Did, were you doing club shows or were you like, invited to a university, you know, corner room to play? What was it like? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Yeah, it was, it was a bit of everything. I think, you know, Greg and I did like a two month tour and we didn't rule anything out. It was, we just tried to play somewhere every day. <laugh>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3230.04" data-end_ts="3230.08" title="3230.04" id=c_"3230.04">__Okay__</span>. This was like, we, we, we, he was living in Boston at the time. We went south, you know, to Florida. We went west all across the southwest. We got the west coast. We went up all the way to Canada, and we went back through the Midwest <span style="color:red" data-ts="3239.83" data-end_ts="3240.12" title="3239.83" id=c_"3239.83">__back__</span> back up through Canada and came back again, you know, two months, literally, like trying to play every day for two months. And, it was, you know, a lot of that was coffee houses. A lot of it was just college. Yeah, sure. It was a lot of college gigs. Some music departments, some student body, you know, and, you know, some talks, things like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Nothing too heavy. It was just very casual at the time. And yeah, Europe almost exclusively dance clubs. But then, and now there's a dynamic where, you know, every dance club with a great sound system will have at least one day a week of some kind of programming that's not dance music. They'll do, you know, a talk, or they'll do some sound art or something, you know, like Burke <span style="color:red" data-ts="3274.6" data-end_ts="3274.8" title="3274.6" id=c_"3274.6">__Hein__</span> is great for this. Even still, they, you know, one day a week they'll do something completely not dance music, you know, Uhhuh <affirmative> using their amazing sound system. They'll let you in there and they'll let you play something more interesting. And, you know, the festivals obviously in Europe, they, you know, they had to be, I had to be flown back and forth, so it had to be, obviously, it was usually part of a, a greater thing, you know? So it was a, you know, there were a lot of film festivals that had music components or <span style="color:red" data-ts="3294.92" data-end_ts="3295.04" title="3294.92" id=c_"3294.92">__a__</span> dance festivals that music components. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh. Hadn't thought about the film, film, music thing, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3299.88" data-end_ts="3300.08" title="3299.88" id=c_"3299.88">__but__</span> that makes sense. Certainly the dance music things. So I would say that now the people that, the people that know your work will know you mostly for doing live performance, featuring a modular synth. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Right. Yeah. In the last say, eight years, that's, I haven't done too much computer performance. I did a, I did a play throughs thing at the, the 20th anniversary of Cranky mm-hmm. <affirmative>, and that, that felt good to do it. That was probably the last time that I've played with <span style="color:red" data-ts="3326.56" data-end_ts="3326.68" title="3326.56" id=c_"3326.56">__the__</span> computer. That was already a year ago. But everything, yeah. For almost the greater part of the last decade has been using a Eurorack system, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So <span style="color:red" data-ts="3335.04" data-end_ts="3335.24" title="3335.04" id=c_"3335.04">__to__</span> play. So, yeah. So in your mind, is the computer thing and the Eurorack thing two different things? Or is it an, or is it kind of one as an extension of the other for you? Or how are they either separated or combined in your mind? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>I mean, the, the workflow and then the ideologies are almost identical. They overlap heavily, really heavily. That's really a lot of, a lot of commonality, a lot of similar ways of working. Especially, I mean, all the computer stuff I'm doing is all max anyway, so there's still this object based thing. There's still connecting a thing to a thing to a thing, you know? Sure. Now, what changes in, in doing it in hardware is maybe a a bit more, it's, it's more limited, of course. I mean, there's no, I mean, I, I'll be the first to say that using a hardware modular system, no matter what the size is, it's still gonna be more, more limited than using a computer. Computer is kind of relatively limitless as far as how you can transform and synthesize sound. The hardware, you're kind of limited to what you have on hand. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>I, I like it. I like the, the collaboration aspect of it. I like the fact that I, I talk to a lot of the people that make the modules individually, and we have a bit long back and forths about what each one is gonna do. You know, I sometimes I feel like I maybe even influenced the manufacturers to put certain features in that I think would be useful. And then they end up coming into the production models. And that's like really fascinating and great. But it's really like, I, I, I like the idea that I have a thing and I can really, I can show up and I can, I can step on stage with it almost completely unpatched, and I can just start going and it can go in a completely different direction every night. Right. And, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3426.02" data-end_ts="3426.18" title="3426.02" id=c_"3426.02">__you__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="3426.18" data-end_ts="3426.26" title="3426.18" id=c_"3426.18">__know__</span>, obviously there's ways to do that in software, but the, the tactility of it is something that I, I don't know. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>I, I, I can't really understate it too much. It's really, it kind of works in a beautiful way. Even when I was doing computer stuff, the, the lack of the sort of visual aspects of performance didn't really bother that me too much. I'm not really too concerned in the way that things look. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, I like the way that they sound. I mean, I would to, if I had my druthers, I would always play in a dark room with no visual stimulus whatsoever. Sure. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3453.76" data-end_ts="3453.98" title="3453.76" id=c_"3453.76">__So__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3453.98" data-end_ts="3454.14" title="3453.98" id=c_"3453.98">__be__</span> about sound, but I don't know the synthesizer, it becomes something else. It becomes just sort of like a way to do sounds quickly, and then in order that you dictate the second you step on stage without having to repair anything. You know, and everything with computer music is, is all preparation. It's all building, it's all fine tuning, you know, regulating. And then, you know, and plus even when I was doing pure improv with the computer, I was still falling into patterns. Sure. You know, fail safe, fail safe solutions, safety nets. And I never do that with a synthesizer. I've never done it once. I've never fallen back on an idea that was, wasn't embellished in some way, you know, different from the last time that I did it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that's, that's interesting. And, and maybe in a way, the, the modular synthesis the perfect tool for that, because practically every time you turn a damn thing on, it's gonna be different, even if you keep everything patched as is. Totally. Now, one of the things that I find interesting is that an awful lot of people that are using, modular synthesizers live, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3511.6" data-end_ts="3511.82" title="3511.6" id=c_"3511.6">__are__</span> have kind of a pre-packed system mm-hmm. <affirmative>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3516.02" data-end_ts="3516.18" title="3516.02" id=c_"3516.02">__Yep__</span>. It sounds to me like you do not do that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>I have a fixed configuration. I mean, it's like, I, I do, I, I do swap it out almost all the time. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3526.3" data-end_ts="3526.46" title="3526.3" id=c_"3526.3">__And__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3526.52" data-end_ts="3526.74" title="3526.52" id=c_"3526.52">__but__</span>, but <span style="color:red" data-ts="3526.86" data-end_ts="3526.94" title="3526.86" id=c_"3526.86">__I__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3526.94" data-end_ts="3527.06" title="3526.94" id=c_"3526.94">__when__</span> I go on a trips, see if I go to Europe and I, and I travel around for five days and play five shifts, and obviously I'm not like, you know, buying and selling modules while I'm over there. <laugh>. Yeah. Actually, the last time I did do that, I went to Schneider's and I got one or two things and took, took a few things out. But it's, you know, even if the configuration is fixed, it's still how you interact with each digital component. It's, it can be totally different from night to night, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. But, well, when I was talking to Richard Devine, he said that he one time showed up at a show and had unpatched his thing, and everyone was kind of freaking out watching him because they traveled with their rigs all pre patched. I can't even imagine that. Yeah. I, I perform with the modular as well. And to me, one of the real benefits of the thing is that when you start with a clear slate, it forces you to make it up on, on the fly. And even if you do have sort of like safety net patches, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3580.66" data-end_ts="3580.88" title="3580.66" id=c_"3580.66">__you__</span>, you have no idea when you plug it in. It's, there's still so much chaotic, behavior in the setting of the knobs and the interaction of the knobs and stuff. It's not gonna be the same. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Yeah, absolutely. I'm constantly baffled by it. I mean, I'll start with something, you know, it'll be humming along and I'll like, okay, great. I, I get what's going on here. This is good. This is very close to what I intended, you know? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And then, you know, you'll, you'll brush against something, you'll unplug something by accident, you'll wipe your hand across a few knobs and everything will change. You know, I had this great moment. I was playing a show last month Yeah. Early December. And, I had traveled, it was in like, it was in Brazil, and, and I got, I got down there, I was fine, but I got really sick like a few days into the trip. Okay. And I had to play two gigs, like back to back with the flu or whatever, you know, some kind of bad, you know, virus, whatever. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>And, I just got into this real, like, fugue state on stage. It was really amazing. I, I kind of just started going and it was doing something. I calculable, you know, like I've understood it. And then it started putting out these kind of like really loud, heavy metal riffs, <laugh>. And I, I still, to this, this day, I have no idea what was going on. I absolutely no idea. It just started doing something and it sounded fantastic, you know, and I was like, are they pumping out? Like, you know, is this music from the board or something like that? Right. You know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="3653.18" data-end_ts="3653.4" title="3653.18" id=c_"3653.18">__is__</span> he trying to tell me to turn down? Or what is this <laugh>? So I didn't, I wasn't confident enough to completely mute what I was doing on the synthesizer, and I could see the levels on the, you <span style="color:red" data-ts="3661" data-end_ts="3661.08" title="3661" id=c_"3661">__know__</span>, the mixer <span style="color:red" data-ts="3661.4" data-end_ts="3661.52" title="3661.4" id=c_"3661.4">__on__</span> the synthesizer <span style="color:red" data-ts="3661.92" data-end_ts="3662.16" title="3661.92" id=c_"3661.92">__that__</span> clearly showed that the sound was coming from inside the instrument. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Right. And, I just stood there completely baffled, <laugh> completely <span style="color:red" data-ts="3667.46" data-end_ts="3667.68" title="3667.46" id=c_"3667.46">__on__</span> it, staring at it being like, you know, I'm looking at the patches and I'm like, I don't know what's doing this, and I know that it's not this, so I'll turn that down and I know it's not this, I'll turn <span style="color:red" data-ts="3675.41" data-end_ts="3675.45" title="3675.41" id=c_"3675.41">__it__</span> and now turn down everything except for one module. That was some kind of like, like a digital oscillator wave table oscillator thing. But all it was is the oscillator with like a sample and hold. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3684.93" data-end_ts="3685.21" title="3684.93" id=c_"3684.93">__Right__</span>. Like a slow sample hold, like pitch <span style="color:red" data-ts="3687.21" data-end_ts="3687.37" title="3687.21" id=c_"3687.21">__in__</span> put, coming into it, uhhuh some animation on the wave shapes. And it was just going to a reverb pedal. And that's all it was. It was just somehow it was getting a signal from like, maybe from the, the, the powered bus <span style="color:red" data-ts="3697.25" data-end_ts="3697.53" title="3697.25" id=c_"3697.25">__board__</span> Yeah. Was sending a signal to some aspect of the, the, the module in the back. And it was doing this beautiful, almost like pentatonic guitar riff, like gated guitar riff, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's unreal. Well, that's, it's awesome. Yeah. Do you, do you record your gigs 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Always? Yeah, I try to. Always, the last two records I put out were, were in quote live records, but that's a distinction. It's like, you know, with this stuff, whether I'm recording it at home and it's the same instrument as I'm playing on stage, it's kind of academic, whether it's a live record or a studio record, whatever you wanna call it. I mean, I'm recording with a little, you know, a Sony handheld recorder at home. Right. I do the same thing when I, when I'm traveling. So it's kind of like, it can be a studio record if I'm not in a studio, you 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Know? Yeah. It's all of a piece. Right, <laugh>. Sure. Yeah. So are you, are you gonna do a Grateful Dead Style? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Yeah. Great Ultra 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Archive, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Do a Dix Pics, you know, series <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Of, of all the, you know. No, I did a few, like, you know, obviously I, I still do things. I still make tapes and CDs and stuff. I did a, I played in Italy in, jeez, when was that? In, in October. And it was a really good show. I felt really good about it. And I made some field recordings and kind of wove this, this kind of tapestry of all the different elements <span style="color:red" data-ts="3766.64" data-end_ts="3766.76" title="3766.64" id=c_"3766.64">__I__</span> recorded when I was in this really small, town in Italy called Vitoria. And, I just, something about that trip, I really liked <span style="color:red" data-ts="3773.4" data-end_ts="3773.6" title="3773.4" id=c_"3773.4">__it__</span>, kind of like, I, I had a lot of psychic resonance with the place, and I came back and I was really inspired by the, the experience of being there. So I like made a thing, I sat down for a weekend and I, I just made a collage of all these things, like elements from the set, elements from the soundcheck, talking to people, you know, ambiance is, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>And so I still make things of these kind of like, live shows, and I kind of feel like that's the majority of my experience with music these days with making music is just when I get to travel and play for people. Right. I'm not so disciplined to sit here at home and like, make a studio record, even though I probably should be doing that. I should have been doing that for the last two or three years. But <laugh>, it's, you know, I mean, I really, I spent a lot of energy last year just playing concerts between the solo things and the gigs with <span style="color:red" data-ts="3812.28" data-end_ts="3812.48" title="3812.28" id=c_"3812.28">__Mark__</span> fell. I think I played 50 or 60 concerts last year, which is a lot, you know? Wow. Yeah. It's a lot when you're carrying a 30 pound synthesizer, you know? Right, right. With all, all the gear and all the cables, you know, halfway around the world to do the shows. So, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So just from a, a practicality standpoint, how do you travel with a modular synth? I mean, what is, what do you, do you have like special casing for it and stuff, or, do you try and jam it in the overhead? Or how does that 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>I <span style="color:red" data-ts="3844.08" data-end_ts="3844.24" title="3844.08" id=c_"3844.08">__jam__</span>, I jam it in the overhead. I have one of those enclave 12 U cases, and it's, it fits beautifully. I've never had a problem with it. I've flown with it now maybe 30 times, and I've never had a problem with it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>It fits beautifully. <span style="color:red" data-ts="3856.36" data-end_ts="3856.52" title="3856.36" id=c_"3856.36">__It__</span>, it can only be on the jumbo liners. They can't do like a, a puddle jumper. Oh, okay. You know? Right, right. Yeah. Puddle puddle jumper. It'll fit in the seat, you know, in front of me, underneath the seat in front of me. Okay. I've had, I've had to strap it into a spare seat a few times, but the seatbelt on it, you know, around the, the handle, but it fits. Yeah. It fits just the, the like an inch on either dimension below the, like maximum, you know, size that you can for a carry on, so. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Wow. Interesting. Yeah. So I'm the enclave 12. 'cause I use a, I use, I have one of the tip top, fold <span style="color:red" data-ts="3886.74" data-end_ts="3886.96" title="3886.74" id=c_"3886.74">__up__</span> things. Oh yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Sure. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Which I like. But, it barely fits in. The problem with it is it doesn't really get covered. So if, you know, if somehow I did run into a situation where it would have to be checked in, I'd be, I'd be totally freaked out because, you know, literally the, all the modules are kind of open to the wind, so 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Oh, yeah. You can't check that thing. There's no way. No, and I can't check, I, I wouldn't check this thing either. You, you can always, you always 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Have, you always buy a Right if worst case 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>You can buy a seat, which the worst case scenario you can buy a seat. But actually easier than that is, you know, they have allowances for bringing musical instruments in the plane anyway. Every airline has one. Back when I was just playing guitar and I had to fly, you can always just bring a guitar in an airplane. Now a guitar won't fit in an overhead compartment. Right. But they have, these luggage lockers in the front of the airplane that the, the stewards and stewards has used Oh, okay. To put their coats and things, and they'll always let you put a guitar in there. So it's hasn't come to that since I've been doing the synthesizer stuff, Uhhuh <affirmative>. But, that's, there's always another option of getting it on the plane without having to gate check it, which is my nightmare, you know? Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's right. That's what I'm talking about. That to me is a nightmare scenario. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="3954.31" data-end_ts="3954.6" title="3954.31" id=c_"3954.31">__Yeah__</span>. They do like, excuse me, sir. Yeah, yeah, totally. Yeah. Like a stroller or something like that big that you don't, they'll put it under the plane and they'll give <span style="color:red" data-ts="3961.68" data-end_ts="3961.76" title="3961.68" id=c_"3961.68">__it__</span> back to you when you land, but it's still like, it's outta your control. So I don't trust it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I don't, I don't either. I have a couple of questions related now to some of the practicalities of, of doing what you do. First of all, you are a performer and an artist, but also a person who runs a label and a distribution thing, which means that you listen to an awful lot of other people's music. Do you ever find that the things you listen to, like for the label, alter the way you approach your own music? Are there things that, that come across your desk that change the way that you do what you do? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Absolutely. Yeah. All the time. I mean, I, I don't want to feel like I'm, you know, working in a bubble or something like that. And then all my influences and, and, you know, working methods are completely set in stone. You know, I'm constantly being influenced by things. You know, I had a huge, I went through this really big, Walter Marchetti phase this year. You know, this composer, Walter Marchetti Italian, no, kind of <span style="color:red" data-ts="4025.8" data-end_ts="4025.92" title="4025.8" id=c_"4025.8">__a__</span>, yeah, it was totally fascinating, kind of bordering on fluxes sort of thing, but Oh, okay. <span style="color:red" data-ts="4030" data-end_ts="4030.28" title="4030" id=c_"4030">__This__</span> really, really deep musical thinker. It's absolutely incredible. He has this very peculiar, unique way of, of, working with, with, you know, with sound, but with ideas, really. It's, <span style="color:red" data-ts="4040" data-end_ts="4040.12" title="4040" id=c_"4040">__he__</span> is really fascinating. So I just, <span style="color:red" data-ts="4041.52" data-end_ts="4041.64" title="4041.52" id=c_"4041.52">__like__</span>, I got so immersed with him and I couldn't, you know, like a few things that I did, I found myself sort of subconsciously being, making Marchetti <span style="color:red" data-ts="4047.84" data-end_ts="4048.04" title="4047.84" id=c_"4047.84">__like__</span> decisions, you know, almost like self-sabotage in a way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>It's something about him I really like. So yeah, it happens to me all the time. I mean, you know, most of what I'm listening to for the shop is archival stuff. That's always one of my focuses, you know? Okay. I like contemporary things that are, that are kind of hinging on classic, you know, ideas. Like we talked about this earlier, but, contemporary music, a lot of times the other contemporary music will only affect me when I, I hear like a really bad idea. Mm-hmm. <laugh> <laugh>, and then I'm like, I should avoid, you know, like I, I think about what it is that really bothers me, and then I'm like, maybe I should consciously avoid doing this, you know, thing. And a lot of the, the things with certain kind of contemporary music that bother me that are like people I don't know, doing, like, like coming back, like something will go out of fashion for a couple of years and then we'll come back and there'll be this really rudimentary version of it that everybody suddenly gloms onto. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Like right now it's dance music, you know, all these people that were making noise music, now they make dance music, but it's like this really rudimentary version of it, you know, it's like <span style="color:red" data-ts="4106.59" data-end_ts="4107.08" title="4106.59" id=c_"4106.59">__roofbox__</span> level stuff, you know? Yeah. And for some, it's really popular. It's this, people love this like, introductory, like revisionist version of dance music, you know? It's really strange to me that doesn't make a lick of sense. So I, I think about, no, it's doesn I think about how, things kind of, I don't know, things cycle around a lot. And I think about how people kind of glom onto ideas because <span style="color:red" data-ts="4128.2" data-end_ts="4128.36" title="4128.2" id=c_"4128.2">__they__</span>, you know, they get dollar signs in their eyes <span style="color:red" data-ts="4129.72" data-end_ts="4129.92" title="4129.72" id=c_"4129.72">__and__</span> they think that things the next thing, and they, you know, they want <span style="color:red" data-ts="4133.04" data-end_ts="4133.08" title="4133.04" id=c_"4133.04">__to__</span>, they want to cash in on it. And, you know, I'm like hyper aware of that stuff when people send me things that are like, trend, you know, it kind of really bothers me sometimes. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's interesting though. I, I really find it refreshing that you're so willing to talk about, your influences and the people that you really sort of obsess about. Because recently I read an interview with, someone who I actually know very well, or I knew him, when he was going through his formative years, and he just immersed himself in all these things and, you know, spent a lot of time really learning the techniques of these people. And then now he treats it as if, he made all this stuff out of full cloth. Right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Yeah, totally. I've seen that a lot too. Yeah. People <span style="color:red" data-ts="4175.16" data-end_ts="4175.44" title="4175.16" id=c_"4175.16">__just__</span> having clear precedence with their work. Oh, yeah. They feel like they're inventing the wheel again, you know, and they talk about it, you know, I had this idea of doing this thing. You're like, well, that's just that thing, you know, <laugh> you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Exactly. It's, it's already got a name, man. Yeah. Well, so I, yeah, I appreciate <span style="color:red" data-ts="4191.46" data-end_ts="4191.68" title="4191.46" id=c_"4191.46">__the__</span>, you being open to that because I think it's really important for people to understand, not only to have influences, but kind of to do what you are constantly doing, which is constantly pushing yourself into finding new influences and diving deeply into them, to really understand where they're coming from. Because I think one of the things I noticed when you talk about some of these influential people is you not only talk about the music that they made, but also the processes that they used to do what they did, which means that you're going beyond just a casual listen, and you're actually really diving into the history of their work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I find that really interesting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>I, the thing that I love to read is, composer bios, like any sort of biography of any composer mm-hmm. <affirmative> 20th century or any, any point in time. I'm really fascinated with people's lives, especially people that make interesting sort of left <span style="color:red" data-ts="4241" data-end_ts="4241.16" title="4241" id=c_"4241">__of__</span> center decisions and how they kind of, whatever parts of their personality led to that, you know? Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>It's really, yeah. So, I mean, it's, it's not just the, the musical ideas and the, the compositions themselves, but everything that kind of filters into why you make a musical decision and, you know, your sort of, your background, you know? Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, at this point now that you we're gonna talk a little bit practicality for the people listening, since you run a, distribution and a label thing for people that are looking to be distributed and or labeled, what are your suggestions? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Well label. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I mean, you must get this all the 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Time. Of course. Yeah. No, and it's, it's good to talk about it, you know? Let's see what, let's talk about what's, what's positive before we talk about what's problematic, what's positive is anytime that you, you have confidence in something that you've done, you know, and then you listen to music and you're aware of what's out there, and you have confidence in something that you, you've done. And, you know, if, if you wanna make something, I mean, this is like, I can speculate about digital things and, and, you know, band camp and that kind of stuff, but that's not really my, my wheelhouse. Right. But what I'm, I'm concerned with is people that, that, that coming from more of a, of a visual arts background, and they wanna make something and they wanna make a, you know, a multiple or they wanna make an addition or something like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, that stuff I really like from <span style="color:red" data-ts="4317.38" data-end_ts="4317.6" title="4317.38" id=c_"4317.38">__Ulu__</span>. We had a guy recently, someone, maybe Andrew Eckler sent me a link to this guy, and he was like a young, Danish musician. And, you know, he was making really interesting modular synthesizer music. All of it was notated. He actually had written graphic scores for everything, right. And then performed the stuff multi-track on, on <span style="color:red" data-ts="4335.28" data-end_ts="4335.36" title="4335.28" id=c_"4335.28">__the__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="4335.5" data-end_ts="4335.72" title="4335.5" id=c_"4335.5">__UAC__</span> system. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. So that alone was like a really interesting approach. It's not just a jam, it's not like a weekend beer drinking, you know, <laugh> a four hour jam on the <span style="color:red" data-ts="4342.96" data-end_ts="4343.12" title="4342.96" id=c_"4342.96">__syn__</span>. They converted into a tape or whatever. This was like really tightly focused, you know, the scores were like these beautiful <span style="color:red" data-ts="4349.18" data-end_ts="4349.4" title="4349.18" id=c_"4349.18">__ous__</span> cardew type graphic scores, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="4351.7" data-end_ts="4352.12" title="4351.7" id=c_"4351.7">__really__</span> text <span style="color:red" data-ts="4352.4" data-end_ts="4352.64" title="4352.4" id=c_"4352.4">__base__</span>, you know, and then little dots and squiggles. And I was like, okay, already. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>That's cool. But then he made like a, a spiral bound 40 page, beautiful little book, you know, like a little folio. And the folio was all the scores for all the pieces, you know? Right. And then of course, tuck in the back, <span style="color:red" data-ts="4367.72" data-end_ts="4367.92" title="4367.72" id=c_"4367.72">__this__</span> CD of the page of explanations. And I was like, what a cool idea. 'cause it's not just like, go to this webpage and read about my work. It's actually like all of the ideas in a, in a package, you know? But this guy, I mean, a special example, this guy, he's a great, you know, obviously a great designer and he thinks visually about music. Obviously he's a great musician as well. But Sure. I like the idea that he could kind of show all of these things without necessarily being too kind of showy about it. You know? It was like a really, it's like a very minimal thing, but just beautiful. You look at it, you listen to the disc, you're flipping through the book. It's like a fully sensory experience. And that was like, I feel like I don't get a enough stuff like that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Well, it's actually interesting you said you, you used the word experience, because as you were talking about it, I was like, wow, this guy found a way to turn a musical release into an experience. Right. I think that that isn't done nearly often enough, just in general. I I, and maybe that's one of the, that goes back to what we were talking about with the, with the cassette trading stuff. How there was sort of like, you know, there was, like you mentioned, there's, there was this excitement that would happen when something would show up in the mailbox. You'd unwrap it, you would have this thing to look at while you, you're listening. There was a real experience. It doesn't happen, especially well when you just click on a SoundCloud thing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Yeah. And it's plus, I mean, the SoundCloud is, when you're looking at SoundCloud, you're on your computer, you're doing, doing email, right. You're reading Facebook, you're doing five things at once every time. Yeah. I mean, I can't sit at a computer and just close my eyes and listen to music. Can't do it. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I hear you. I hear you. Yeah. If nothing else, you can see the, the flash of the screen through your eyelids, and that just doesn't work. But I think, I think also what's interesting is the, is with the resurgence of vinyl, I mean, I, I'm starting now to talk to people, not, not people who have always been into vinyl, but people that are returning to vinyl mm-hmm. <affirmative>. And so much, so often the way they talk about it is that when they listen to vinyl, it's an experience. So it's the experience of taking the thing outta the sleeve of putting it on, dropping the needle, hearing the clicks, and the clicks are sort of new every time. You know, all of this kinda stuff represents an escape from the online and looking at the screen and all of this other stuff. It, it forces them into the position of accepting the experience. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Absolutely. You have to, you have to meet it on its own terms, you know? Yeah, yeah. You can't go too far in 20 minutes, you know what I mean? You put a record. That's right. You gotta come and lift the needle after 20 minutes, so you gotta be in the room with the thing, you know, that's like, that's asking more from the listening experience than any internet thing ever will, you know, it's like you hit play on SoundCloud. You, you can be in the next state by the time the thing ends, <laugh>, it's not like it's gonna stop and click and click and click and Right. Destroy the file at the end. If you leave it playing, it's like you're gonna go onto something else automatically, <laugh>. So what a different, like, sort of way of looking at music listening. It's like you start an actual physical reaction, right? You push the button on a motor starts up, you know? Yes. Yeah. <laugh>. And then you put a thing, a physical amplifier on a, on a physical piece of thing, you know, and it makes sound. What, how cool is that? You know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Indeed. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>There's <span style="color:red" data-ts="4554.16" data-end_ts="4554.24" title="4554.16" id=c_"4554.16">__no__</span>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Keith, I want to thank you so much, for the time. Boy, we blew through that hour and then some, I, it was, fascinating talking to you, and I really appreciate the openness to which you, came at everything. It was really fantastic. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Yeah, no problem. Great chatting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. So, have a great day and I'll talk to you again soon. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Keith: </b>Okay, sounds good. Bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>All right. I'm in Los Angeles, just got beat up by the NAMM Show. I think I have a bad case of Mthr. I'm not sure that I'm going to be able to be all that excited to talk to people for the next couple of days, but in the meantime, I'm excited to talk to you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I hope that you enjoyed hearing from, Keith Ton Whitman. Think he's a phenomenon. I think his work is incredible. If you haven't heard it, you can dip a toe in through all the digital memes. I get some of it through Spotify, but checkout memoral blue music, it's got a lot of cool stuff. And it's worth checking out. You'll find key stuff as well as a ton of other interesting music. Other than that, I want to thank all the people I got to meet at namm. I got to see Paul <span style="color:red" data-ts="4635.73" data-end_ts="4636.08" title="4635.73" id=c_"4635.73">__Shier__</span> and Mark Veil, hung out a little bit with, Keith McMillan. That was cool. Got a chance to hang out with a bunch of my coworkers as well. I know there's somebody I'm missing. Oh yeah. The people at, Zootopia, actually went out to breakfast with them. Had a great time. I want <span style="color:red" data-ts="4655.44" data-end_ts="4655.52" title="4655.44" id=c_"4655.44">__to__</span> thank all those people for spending the time. I wanna thank you for listening and have a great week. I'll talk to you next time.
