<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, today I get to speak with someone, kind of new to me. His name's Steven Ental. And, he reached out to me, to just describe a new work that he was doing, which is a CD project. I got a copy and I really loved it, but beyond that, it made me realize that it kind of hit a really neat point between, a lot of the stuff that we generally think of as elect electronic music and the kind of stuff I run into in my work life, which is the electroacoustic world, the world that is occupied by Seamus and a lot of academics that I also love. And so this was an opportunity to me to, for me to interview somebody to talk about, the differences, the influences that that one has had on the other, and just to talk about like a, a different part of the electronic music world. So, with that, I'm gonna say, hello to Steven. Hey, Steven. How's it going? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen Ruppenthal: </b>It's going well, Darwin, thanks for, thanks for initiating this. This is great. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thank you for reaching out and thanks for sharing your cd. Like I said, I found it really enjoyable. Really fantastic. Why don't we have you tell us a little bit about, what you have here with the cd, but also what kind of work you're doing in general. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Right. Well, the work that I'm doing kind of comes in three areas. One, of course, as you mentioned, is the electroacoustic work that I do with my trumpet frugal <span style="color:red" data-ts="92.405" data-end_ts="92.645" title="92.405" id=c_"92.405">__horn__</span>, and working with composers that use, analog and digital electronic music systems for electroacoustic works. And that's been a theme for a very, very long time. But before I go into that, the second area is an area called sound poetry, or text sound composition. And that has been, a focus of mine since, you know, since the early seventies, early to mid seventies. Then the third area that I'm interested in is just as a trumpet player playing the entire literature, both old, new and not yet composed <laugh>, music for, for the trumpet. Whereas I, I do play symphonic work. My, my love is in extended techniques and using the trumpet to produce sounds both electro acoustically and just acoustically that, is, unexpected at times. And, and certainly it's a path that's not trodden by a lot, but there are some luminaries that do <span style="color:red" data-ts="151.605" data-end_ts="151.805" title="151.605" id=c_"151.605">__try__</span> that pass. So there's the, the kind of three areas that I, that I'm, that I'm working in the electroacoustic area, live electronics, and the tech sound area. And then, and then just, the acoustic trumpet extended to as far as it can go, on my own and with others. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, this is really a, an interesting three legs to your artistic stool, <laugh>. I think it's pretty wild now. I have had opportunities to talk, with people in the past about working with, you know, combining typical, acoustic instruments with electronic work. I did talk to Jeff Kaiser, who also is doing, a lot of le live, electroacoustic work, but there seems to be relatively few brass players really, that get into, get into electronics. What is it that drew you into the combination of that as an acoustic instrument, but also, adding electronics to the mix? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Well, you know, I started performing with, Alan Strange and Don Buchla and David Rosenbaum, JB Floyd, many of these names you, you know, I'm sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? Absolutely. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Dan Lentz, back, back in the early days where we would do live electronic, electroacoustic performances with, with, in those days was Analog Systems. It was booklet, it was Sge, it was Moog, it was, you know, right. It was whatever, what I brought to the table at the time. 'cause I was just learning the Cynthia, the Cynthia a KS system. What I brought to the table was I was trumpet player, so I was welcome into the fold, as a trumpet player with my sound being processed in real time. And that's what really got me into the electroacoustic world, was being able to get into a setting with these, this caliber of, of players playing on instruments that were really quite new in their day. I mean, I, I guess I could say that, you know, we're talking about 19 69, 19 70, 71, 72 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. You were watching them being invented, in fact. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Well, and, you know, Don made my, my analog systems for me, I have a, I have a booklet easel that he made for me as I joined the, electric Weasel Ensemble with Don and Alan and Pat. And then later on down the road, I have a large 200 system. So these were actually constructed and I would say, okay, I want one of those and one of those <laugh> put that in there for me and make sure that I can process my horn real time. So that's how I got going. And we performed, back in those days around the Bay Bay area, maybe one or two concerts a month, sometimes more. And, took it on the road, went across the us, took it to Europe, the Weasels, did a big tour in Europe where we hit most of the major, major cities and, and played for people all the way from, you know, from, from Paris all the way up to Stockholm at Filkin, <span style="color:red" data-ts="328.845" data-end_ts="329.005" title="328.845" id=c_"328.845">__and__</span> Right. So that's what got me into it. And I have to credit Alan, my mentor and colleague who passed away in 2008 with, with keeping me, you know, keeping me hot for that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, you've already dropped some really interesting nuggets about, things you've done in places you've been. But before we get into that, I would like to hear a little bit about your, your complete background. Like, how did you get to be the musician you are, I mean, it's, I see where these people would've taken, taken you and, and, really kind of move you forward. But like, how did you, in, in, how did you get into trumpet? Where did you, where did you study and what kind of propelled you into working with these guys? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Well, where I come from is as a young trumpet player. I had a couple of teachers and, when I got to where I was to <span style="color:red" data-ts="379.005" data-end_ts="379.165" title="379.005" id=c_"379.005">__get__</span> my two degrees san as a state where I did both the performance and a musicology degree, I was introduced pretty quickly to new music. And at that time, we're talking about Earl Brown, John Cage, of course, right. Bob Moran. And then later on, very, very early John Adams. But, you know, the New York School was very important then. And I began performing new music. We did one of the first performances in the Bay area of NC Terry Riley's. Right. This was right after the recording was made. So we're talking 69 70. And that propelled me forward in new music. And then as I be began my degree programs, I realized that I was more interested in an interdisciplinary degree rather than a straight music degree. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>So I went into sound poetry and was able to bring in a lot of different energies with that. There was performance energy, that was a literature energy. There was the text energy, whether that was literature or not. And, and there was the, the movements at the time that kind of wrapped around that, besides the <span style="color:red" data-ts="442.375" data-end_ts="442.725" title="442.375" id=c_"442.375">__datas__</span> and the fluxus groups going up to the 20th century, <span style="color:red" data-ts="446.405" data-end_ts="446.525" title="446.405" id=c_"446.405">__I__</span>, I was introduced to, the, the sound poets that were actually working at the time, like Bernard <span style="color:red" data-ts="453.485" data-end_ts="453.685" title="453.485" id=c_"453.485">__Sik__</span> in Paris. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, Han in, in, <span style="color:red" data-ts="456.715" data-end_ts="457.005" title="456.715" id=c_"456.715">__Inge__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="457.005" data-end_ts="457.245" title="457.005" id=c_"457.005">__Stone__</span> in, in England, Stan Hanson and, Lars Gunner Bodin in, in, in Sweden. So I was introduced to these people through the American Tech sound composer, Charles Erian. And I realized that this was an area that I wanted to explore, that I could use my horn, I could use my voice, and I could use my electronics. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>And so that really pushed me through college and finished up with a degree. I wrote the first, book in English on, on sound poetry, text, sound composition. That was back in the mid, mid to late seventies. And that's, that's kind of kept me going. So, you know, from trumpet, trumpet teachers playing in symphonies, playing in chamber groups, and then playing in new music ensembles where I was able to actually explore new kinds of composition, new kinds of sounds and new ways of approaching instruments, both from the physical aspect, approaching the instrument itself, but also from the electroacoustic aspect where I'm taking my horn and I'm processing it through a number of, of different electronic instruments at that time, analog. But then, you know, it's gone into the digital realms now. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So that's kind of where I came from. And there was a huge push in the new music area very early on. My other teacher was Lou Harrison. He was actually on my thesis committee, and really was very encouraging in the direction that I was going along with Alan and Charles and a few others. So it's been kind of a, <span style="color:red" data-ts="543.445" data-end_ts="543.565" title="543.445" id=c_"543.445">__a__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="543.585" data-end_ts="543.805" title="543.585" id=c_"543.585">__in__</span> enrapturing and in all encasing, encompassing, life in new music. And at that time, the ending of the seventies, I actually taught in the interdisciplinary and experimental arts department at San Francisco State. So I was actually able to carry that into, some university teaching for a while. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, that's awesome. Now I have to wonder what it must have felt like at that time. I mean, you, you kinda came through the musical zone at a, at a time of like, fantastic change. I mean, in a way, the late sixties and the early seventies, if we look back at it now, it just, it looks bizarre, the rapidity of change, but also sort of like the whole social upheaval, that surrounded, it, it, it just sort of like, seemed like all ground was shaky ground at the time, and everything was up for a great big change. Is that what it felt like to you? Or did it just feel like I'm exploring and I'm taking this route and, and whatever, you know, I, I'm trying to get a sense of what that felt like. When you're in the middle of, you have this new music ramming head on into these <span style="color:red" data-ts="615.675" data-end_ts="616.285" title="615.675" id=c_"615.675">__orchestra__</span> things, and also the electronics and things like, like text-based scoring and stuff, all hitting the musical landscape at the same time. Did it seem like an upheaval or did it just seem like a natural evolution? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Well, because I'm a student of, of music, historical student of music, it seemed to me like an evolution. But at the time, it was like a malmstrom, it was like a <laugh>. It was like this swirling mass of sound and influences and people, it, the small group that I was involved with, you know, we were all basically very happy doing this weird stuff. We were very happy being outsiders, which we were very much the outsiders at the time. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, and we were very happy being explorers. But being a Gemini, I kind of, always worked in many different worlds all at once. And one hour I would go in and play, you know, orchestra or large ensemble, and I'd be playing the traditional composers of the 19th and 20th century. And then the next hour I would be playing a, a piece by Mauricio Kaggle. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>You know, you, you can imagine the, you had to kind of split your brain because you <span style="color:red" data-ts="687.005" data-end_ts="687.205" title="687.005" id=c_"687.005">__play__</span> your horn, you play your horn with certain techniques here, and then you kind of, almost, you, you can just throw those out because you have to explore in a different direction there. So, to answer your question, yes, I, I felt somewhat torn, but I loved it. You know, I loved it. I felt like it made, it really made the time. And of course, this was the time of, of civil rights, and this was the time of the Vietnam War. This was the time of, marching and campuses getting closed down. So we actually used that energy in some of the pieces that we created and wrote in the various new music ensembles. I remember one where everybody was dressed in diapers and on the back of the diapers would be the name of a, of a country. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>And we got in this, we got in this ring, this, wrestling ring. And, it was kind of a wrestle off. And the person that was left was this 300 pound friend of mine, tuba player. And, and I, we were wrestling together. And on the back of his diaper it said, USA, and on the back of my diaper, I didn't forget what it was, but he creamed me. And so it was perfect for the <span style="color:red" data-ts="750.725" data-end_ts="750.925" title="750.725" id=c_"750.725">__time__</span>, <laugh>. And that's, you know, that's the kind of energies that was going on. So it's enough to slap you upside the head. Of course. Right, of course. But you can imagine the, the positive energy that went with this for exploring, you know, John said, John Cage said, you know, basically everything is music. Just open your ears. And I think when you learned that back in the late sixties and the early seventies, you had, you know, that was a leg up. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>That was, that was kind of a carte blanche to go in and explore, which is what we did. And it's what I did going into electroacoustic music at the time. First with the, with the <span style="color:red" data-ts="787.205" data-end_ts="787.405" title="787.205" id=c_"787.205">__Sym__</span>, which is an English instrument from London. And then, and then full bore on with, with <span style="color:red" data-ts="794.225" data-end_ts="794.645" title="794.225" id=c_"794.225">__Bookla__</span>, I kind of bypassed Moog. Right. I'm not, not a Moog guy. I love Moog's instruments, but knowing <span style="color:red" data-ts="800.505" data-end_ts="800.725" title="800.505" id=c_"800.505">__Don__</span> and hanging out with Don and being performing with Don so much, Don Bookla, I was around all of the instruments as they were being made, and that was just, that was mind blowing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. I imagine. He's an incredible guy, but also, did get a chance of seeing, seeing occasionally some real brilliance just roll right out of him. That's cool. So let's talk a little bit about, the, each of the, these legs. And first of all, you said the first leg was your work with electro acoustics, and you specifically stayed with and live electronics. What is exactly does that mean to you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Well, it really means, it means putting yourself on the line, because you're, you're out there, it's, you're <span style="color:red" data-ts="843.875" data-end_ts="843.955" title="843.875" id=c_"843.875">__not__</span>, I do tape work also, and I have many, many different tape <span style="color:red" data-ts="847.315" data-end_ts="847.555" title="847.315" id=c_"847.315">__works__</span> that I've done in the studio. Okay. But, and, and I enjoy that work a lot. But when you're performing live with electronics, you're doing an, you're doing more listening sometimes than playing Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, especially if it's a very complicated electronic setup where you're bringing in many, many voices and you're mixing them in real time. And then when you are playing over the top of that and processing your sound and mixing that with what's going on, and you're in surround sound, eight channels, for example, which is what I'm performing in usually these days, it's a very complicated setup. And you're really, you're really focused on the sound product and where it's going and the balances and the, the timur of that sound, and is it the right <span style="color:red" data-ts="891.005" data-end_ts="891.205" title="891.005" id=c_"891.005">__temper__</span> that you want? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>And we're talking about electroacoustic sound. We're not just talking about the sound of the trumpet or a hor. So in live performance, many, many different things can happen in this particular genre of electroacoustic music. Many things can happen that sometimes they're out of your control. Right. For example, for example, my, my performing colleague and I, Brian Belay in a group called Soundproof, we have <span style="color:red" data-ts="917.445" data-end_ts="917.565" title="917.445" id=c_"917.445">__a__</span>, a work that we call a strange diversion that's, kind of an homage to, to Alan. And I will feed Brian from my Bookless system. I will feed Brian, segments of sound and pieces and phrases of things that are coming out. And then he will take those into a, a system called a <span style="color:red" data-ts="937.265" data-end_ts="937.485" title="937.265" id=c_"937.265">__kea__</span>, and he will process 'em in real time. And sometimes he has random processing going on simultaneously. So there's four or five, six voices going out, or up to eight voices if we're doing eight channel sound. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>And, and we are never quite sure <laugh>, what's, you know, what's going to happen now, we, we're, we're, since the pieces are pretty well mapped out, and they are directed improvisations to use one of Alan's terms. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, we kind of, we have a, we have a grasp on the form and the grasp on the sections and what goes on in the sections, but underneath that and inside that, there'll be little things that happen that we could not have predicted. So that's where the kind of the risk factor comes in, because you gotta make something with that. Right. Right. You gotta make, you have to, like, in the old days when a patch cord would break, or a line stretched across the stage would break an audio cable, something drastic would happen, and you had to make music out of that. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Well, it's not quite as bad <laugh> as it was back in the old days when you were stretching 50 lines across the stage, and you had, you had <span style="color:red" data-ts="1002.765" data-end_ts="1002.965" title="1002.765" id=c_"1002.765">__real__</span> tore tape recorders with loops going on. It's not, not that kind of crazy. But, many times, in fact, we, we did Seamus, you mentioned Seamus, we just got back from Seamus up in Oregon. Yeah. About a month ago. And we did a piece and, it was a very different experience because some things happened that neither one of us expected. And so that's where the, the improvisation, where the skill in improvisation comes in. What are you gonna do with it? Right. How are you make it in, how are you gonna make it interesting and within context, or totally without context and surprise yourself in the audience too. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Right. Because sometimes that kind of stuff can propel you in a direction you didn't exactly expect to go. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Exactly. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I know I've got, I've had a chance to do some of these, what, what you call, directed, directed improvisations. And one of the things I <span style="color:red" data-ts="1055.045" data-end_ts="1055.325" title="1055.045" id=c_"1055.045">__note__</span> is that the interesting nature of it is almost, proportional to the amount of risk that there is at play. Right? Yes. It's like, if things are really well, well-defined and well-directed in a way, it almost kind of loses a little bit of, it's the edginess and the excitement where if you feel like you're on the edge, I think that that's transmitted the people. And that adds to sort of like the excitement of the performance too, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>It does. I mean, if you, if you have something that's really perfect and everything flows exactly in some kind of predestined fashion, and everyone's sitting there going, shaking their heads up and down. Yep. Yep. I, I see that. I expected that. That's a good, that phrase is kind of tied off there, the next starts. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1101.465" data-end_ts="1101.685" title="1101.465" id=c_"1101.465">__And__</span> that, you know, then, then it sounds like it, it might come out of a studio. Right? Right. It's not, you, you lose that highwire act in performance, and you get that in, you know, in all performance. I'm, I'm a symphony trumpet player, and we just did Mahler one a week ago. I'm principal in the symphony. So if you know about Mahler one, you know that basically the last page of the score in Mahler, one for the trumpet section, especially the principal trumpet player, is, is just, it's, you're flat out. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Just flat out Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, many things can, <laugh> can happen when you're, when you're screaming over the top of the orchestra <laugh> and everyone else is kind of there with you. So it, it can happen in all settings, but it's predictive that it's gonna happen. This kind of risk factor, high risk factor when you're doing real-time, electro electronic music, or real-time electroacoustic music. And I'm not talking about melodic keyboard style, you know, where everything is generated within a encapsulated, within a, a scale or a chordal pattern, which, you know, there's some really fine electronic music, that's, that's developed. But I'm talking about when you're creating sonic events, right. And you're matching those sonic events, and you are kind of contrasting and complimenting each other, and you're letting them crash against each other, and you're moving them around the room in four different directions. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I think that, that, that actually is really super apparent in your album. I mean, one of the things that, one of the things that I got out of your album was, was that you, you do do extended technique stuff on the trumpet, which is interesting, but you don't do it in a way that sort of is like, Hey, look at me. I'm doing a wacky thing with the trumpet. But instead, it's like, I mean, it really, even your trumpet playing a lot of times really sounds very synthesis like. Right. Hmm. <affirmative>, it seems like <span style="color:red" data-ts="1215.935" data-end_ts="1216.285" title="1215.935" id=c_"1215.935">__there__</span> like that, like even the, to tonality of a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1219.205" data-end_ts="1219.565" title="1219.205" id=c_"1219.205">__booklet__</span> system pro has influenced, your trumpet styling. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Well, it has, and of course, as you know, the Moog has a really kind of trademarked sound. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, the Boulet does too. And when you hear a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1232.385" data-end_ts="1232.805" title="1232.385" id=c_"1232.385">__Bookla__</span> play, you can tell a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1233.565" data-end_ts="1233.885" title="1233.565" id=c_"1233.565">__booklet__</span>, well, after you <span style="color:red" data-ts="1234.405" data-end_ts="1234.645" title="1234.405" id=c_"1234.405">__play__</span> performing on a buka 30 years, you, you do, you do have a sense or more <laugh>, you do have a sense of that sound. And it comes back to you all the time. I'm trying to extend that sound. For instance, you mentioned my cd, it's called Flamethrower, and it's on Revelo records. There's, there's two pieces by Alan Strange on there. Right? The first one is called Velocity Studies five <span style="color:red" data-ts="1257.895" data-end_ts="1258.245" title="1257.895" id=c_"1257.895">__Enate__</span> is from a series of his that he started in 1987, and he's got five of these, velocity studies. He waited 14 years between number four and number five, and, which is the end <span style="color:red" data-ts="1271.845" data-end_ts="1272.045" title="1271.845" id=c_"1271.845">__gate__</span> one. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>And what he did was he stacked, and these <span style="color:red" data-ts="1274.605" data-end_ts="1274.765" title="1274.605" id=c_"1274.605">__are__</span>, by the way, this is all notated in traditional notation very precisely. He stacked seven trumpets plus two oblig trumpet trumpets on top. And I had to go through in the studio, and for this piece, which is, roughly what, seven minutes long, I had to record each one of those tracks. There's three, there's three movements at Taaka. I had to, and, and plus the two oblig trumpets, and then mix 'em in with the electronics that he created, basically with Max M MaxMSP. Okay. So what you get is you get what Alan wanted, right? You get the sound that Alan wrote and all the notes that you wrote in. And I hope you get a chance to, to play that, because it's such a rich, rich piece. People listen to it, and they're just astonished that the conglomerate sound, the aggregate sound can, can be the way it is. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>So that was one, the other one totally different. It's called, NTY Magic <span style="color:red" data-ts="1327.435" data-end_ts="1327.725" title="1327.435" id=c_"1327.435">__Land__</span>, the earlier piece that Alan composed in 2004. For me, that's kinda an ambient piece, right? Mm-Hmm. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1333.605" data-end_ts="1333.645" title="1333.605" id=c_"1333.605">__<affirmative>__</span>. And, and the score, the score, rather than being notated out in <span style="color:red" data-ts="1336.365" data-end_ts="1336.445" title="1336.365" id=c_"1336.365">__the__</span> traditional notation, he's written it out in kind of visual notation, linear notation that allows me to, to make up what I, what I wanna play. I mean, he has some guidelines, you know, he said, don't do this, don't do that. Kind of do this, do that, and then go, and so then you get this pad, this very ambient kind of new, new age pad, which a Alan didn't do. This is a very different piece for him. And it allowed me just to, kind of float in that pad with my, with my horn, flugel horn in this case, and be able to not only create some melodic material, but listening to the sounds that he created with his Max MSP system. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>And, and he used, he used quite a few toys with this, and try to, IM imitate some of that so that I'm blending into the orchestration. Sure. Misty Magic Gland was a very different piece for Alan. I'm surprised that he would write it for me. 'cause I don't think he ever heard me play a new age work, or maybe he did. Some of my early pieces were quite that way. But, it was, it's such an enjoyable piece to play, and it's the one that gets played the most because you can play it late at night and people dream off to sleep with it. And it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1410.965" data-end_ts="1411.045" title="1410.965" id=c_"1410.965">__a__</span> <laugh>. It's, you know, it's, it's just, it's a lovely piece. Whereas the, the first piece end <span style="color:red" data-ts="1416.725" data-end_ts="1416.965" title="1416.725" id=c_"1416.725">__gate__</span> is just total balls to the wall screamer. It just starts. Right. There's a middle section that's very lovely, as you know, it's all done. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>All the trumpets are done in Harman Mute with the stem out. Stem is off. Okay. And so you get, you get seven layers plus, plus two, including the, the solo trumpet all in Harman Mute. And it's just <span style="color:red" data-ts="1440.845" data-end_ts="1441.065" title="1440.845" id=c_"1440.845">__the__</span>, the textures that he's created there just are just so lovely, very long. And then it, and then it goes back into this very, fast allegro, finale, that just winds up with an explosion at the end. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1455.995" data-end_ts="1456.345" title="1455.995" id=c_"1455.995">__Right__</span>. So that, that was a very important piece. You know, he started that back in about 2007. He finished it, he finished it in December, January, 2008. And I came up to Bainbridge where he was living, and we had a big concert up there where I performed his work. And also Brian Belays piece, which is called System of Shadows, which is also on the cd. I performed it for him. And, and he passed away six weeks later. Oh. It was really tragic. He just kind of kept it together. 'cause he <span style="color:red" data-ts="1486.105" data-end_ts="1486.145" title="1486.105" id=c_"1486.105">__is__</span>, he is very ill with cancer. He kept it together for that concert. And, I was able to perform that piece for him. And, and then when I was leaving, I, I didn't think I was gonna see him again. And sure enough, February, 20th of, 2008, he, he passed on. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Interesting. You talk about the, the different scoring techniques. Unfortunately these, the scores for these aren't on the site, but you do have a couple of scores. You have November twilight and system of shadows. You have scores for those available on the, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>It's on the extended catalog site, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Which is, actually really neat because I know when I'm teaching, sometimes I like to, I would like to show people like modern scoring techniques, and sometimes these scores aren't easily available. And so it's really neat to do those. I'll put a link on the show notes for people who want to, both check out your album and dig further in, into something, into the scores and stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But what I noticed is, the thing I really liked is, the, the one that, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1546.825" data-end_ts="1547.145" title="1546.825" id=c_"1546.825">__Eleni__</span> LIOs, is that how you say her name? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1549.825" data-end_ts="1550.025" title="1549.825" id=c_"1549.825">__Eleni__</span>. LIOs, yes. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>The one she did is actually an interesting thing because first of all, they're kind of extensive notes on what she wanted, in terms of a technical setup. Yes. Which is pretty interesting because it's done in kind of generic fashion. So as technology changes, you can still kind of follow along. But I also really like the idea that, that she had sort of like this simultaneous mixture of both standard traditional notation and a more graphic notation. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, which looked like it was really interesting. And it was a cool way to document it, to document, Hey, let's do electronics, but here's sort of the arc I want you to follow. It looks like it was, I mean, it was really masterfully done. I thought 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Elany and I worked on that for almost two years, back and forth. You know, she's a full professor of music at Bowling Green State University in, in Ohio. And also the director of the electronic music studio there. Right. She heard me play Alan's piece, I think it was, I, it was one year at ICMC, back in New York. And that she came up and she said, okay, I wanna write a piece for you. So we spent two years and we designed a vocabulary. So getting back to your point on the notation, if you, when you look at the score, you find that she's asking for certain things for me to do. Well, the way that she came up with those is we would be on the phone and she would say, now what about if you do this? Can you give me that <laugh>? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Is, is it possible to do a gla sandi, a step gla Sandi up? And at the same time a vocal movement down? What happens if you move your vows like this and play that? So what we did over a very long period of time is we developed a vocabulary with each one of these kinds of sounds. I would, I would give her what she wants, and then she would, we would give it a name together. And we had some pretty, pretty wild names for, for some of this stuff. <laugh> really wild names. Some of 'em were not too wild. But there was one thing that we called a balloon tone, ricochet gliss, of course, a flap tongue, a mouthpiece pop. And then we, we would bring out articulations that I hadn't even heard of from God knows where. And so we developed a, an Excel spreadsheet, if you will, of about 50 different pieces, different vocabulary items. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>And, and then she would take those items and then decide how she wanted to use them in the arch of the piece. And then of course, then, then on top of that, she would use her max MSP patch and process those sounds while I was doing them in, in live. All of this piece is live, the processing is done live with an algorithm, using Max MSP. I'm sure many of your listeners will know what that is. And so she started sending me fragments, and then I started, putting the fragments together, and then I would record them and send them back to her. And we <span style="color:red" data-ts="1731.045" data-end_ts="1731.285" title="1731.045" id=c_"1731.045">__worked__</span> this way. And then we'd do Skype, like we're doing, like you and I are doing now. Yeah. And I would record things in my studio and send them to her, and then she would process them and send them back. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>And thus November Twilight got put together like this with a text by, with a Haiku text by Wally <span style="color:red" data-ts="1746.845" data-end_ts="1747.125" title="1746.845" id=c_"1746.845">__Swiss__</span>. And it was just delightful working with Elany. She is absolutely my favorite Electroacoustic composer, or as they call, as that's, called in the business, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1758.005" data-end_ts="1758.125" title="1758.005" id=c_"1758.005">__a__</span> charismatic composer. She's master just a master at this. Her works are some of the finest charismatic works that I've ever heard. And to have a piece that she wrote for me is all, all live with interactive electronics was superb. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1771.845" data-end_ts="1771.965" title="1771.845" id=c_"1771.845">__And__</span>, and I consider this to be kind of the centerpiece of the cd. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. It's beautiful. It's a, it's a beautiful thing. But I'm always interested whenever I get a chance to ask people about collaboration, I do. Because there are so many different styles of collaboration. And this sounds really unique because you are, you are kind of sharing multi-dimensionally, right? You talk things through, but you'd also, this idea of building up a shared vocabulary. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, that seems like a really, that's kind of like a cool elemental way to start the process. But then also sharing through those meetings in, in the mechanism that you described, what was actually the hardest part of that collaboration, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>As I'm looking here at the score, I think the hardest part of the collaboration was when she had finally put it all together. And she said, okay, here's the score. Now I want you to do all these gestures, all these vocabulary elements, and we're gonna be doing them. It's gonna happen pretty quick. <laugh>, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. And so as you look at the score, you realize, I'm, I'm having to do extended techniques every time I pick up the horn. Right. And I don't drop 'em. Of course, the, the piece as your listeners will, will hear is for, for, for these little finger symbols called Es, and it's for voice. There's a lot of sound poetry in this text. Sound composition where my voice, I'm actually performing, extended techniques with my voice and I'm being processed at the same time. And then, trumpet. And I use a, I use a C trumpet on this, with and without a bunch of mutes that she wanted me to go through. 'cause that was a whole other thing, developing <span style="color:red" data-ts="1872.785" data-end_ts="1873.005" title="1872.785" id=c_"1872.785">__vab__</span>, a mute vocabulary. Oh. So the hardest thing, the hardest thing was, okay, now you gotta play it <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>You know, we've done all of this research and all this fun stuff. Now you gotta play it 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well and play it linearly. I mean, even when you look at it, you can kind of see the step-by-step approach to building this up, but then to do a linear performance that had to be a little, a little intimidating. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Well, at first it was, and I, you know, she had a, a foot pedal for me so that I could actually move the, max MSP queues forward myself. I see. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>I was so busy. I'm, I'm, I'm so busy doing other things, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1913.105" data-end_ts="1913.325" title="1913.105" id=c_"1913.105">__but__</span> I say, you know, I don't wanna think about one more limb pressing on something <laugh>. I want you to do it. And so it's either Elany that runs electronics for me, or Brian <span style="color:red" data-ts="1922.895" data-end_ts="1923.245" title="1922.895" id=c_"1922.895">__Belay__</span>, my performance partner that runs electronics for me. And I just concentrate on the notes that you see and trying to get that right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Yeah. Now, you mentioned that this piece has, like bridges into the world of sound poetry for people that aren't familiar with that as a, as a specific phrase, as a concrete concept. Why don't you talk a little bit about what it, what it represents to you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Well, very briefly, sound poetry is the, the, the combination of text and music where they both inform each other. And, we're not talking about art songs. We're talking about, getting inside a word, getting inside the sound of a word, getting inside of how that word is made in your mouth or wherever you decide to make the word. And then being able to, make a, a sonic gesture with that, and then stringing those together as you would in a composition. So there's many realtime sound poets that are working <span style="color:red" data-ts="1979.285" data-end_ts="1979.605" title="1979.285" id=c_"1979.285">__right__</span>, right now. Like, yap Blanc is a very famous one. Enzio Minelli is another one that just do all of this with a microphone. And they go through the, just the, the weirdest kind of vocal gymnastics, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1993.225" data-end_ts="1993.445" title="1993.225" id=c_"1993.225">__ala__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1993.645" data-end_ts="1993.805" title="1993.645" id=c_"1993.645">__Ami__</span> Chopan and, Bernard <span style="color:red" data-ts="1995.645" data-end_ts="1995.845" title="1995.645" id=c_"1995.645">__Sik__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1995.845" data-end_ts="1996.045" title="1995.845" id=c_"1995.845">__two__</span> of the sound quotes of the, of the last century. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>It sound poetry goes all the way into, electroacoustic processing with the Swedes. They had a school, there's a, there was a school in, not a school, but a collection of artists in Stockholm that created this, group called <span style="color:red" data-ts="2014.465" data-end_ts="2014.685" title="2014.465" id=c_"2014.465">__In__</span> and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2015.685" data-end_ts="2015.725" title="2015.685" id=c_"2015.685">__Fil__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2015.905" data-end_ts="2016.125" title="2015.905" id=c_"2015.905">__In__</span>. Started, started as a, an arts, a performing arts group, and then gradually expanded itself into some experimental arts groups. Thus you have electronic music studios, poets, vocalists, music, mu musicians working together to extend the voice. So, any of these names that I've mentioned, you know, you can go on to Roy or many other places on the web and listen to sound files from them. For me, sound poetry hit very, very early. I wrote my thesis on it, but even before I wrote my thesis on it, I was writing to the sound points of the day and, and asking them the same questions you did that you just asked me, what is this? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Where does it come, where does it come from? Well, you know, it goes all the way back to the Dos and Hugo Ball. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and Emmy. Hennings and Zara. And you know, that, that coie of people around Zurich and the mid 19, like 1916. And then it goes back further to the, the Italian, futurist like Martti, for example. And then it goes back even further to the Russian futurist Knik coffin and his group of, of, poets that extended poetry beyond just Mary had a little lamb, and the lamb fainted, you know, just, it, it, it extends it much, much beyond that. So, so that you get the visceral sound of the voice and you're telling stories with that. And of course, musicians picked up on that like crazy in the 1950s. Think of Barrio with Agio, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2104.145" data-end_ts="2104.435" title="2104.145" id=c_"2104.145">__Tema__</span> Maggio <span style="color:red" data-ts="2104.835" data-end_ts="2104.995" title="2104.835" id=c_"2104.835">__at__</span> Joys, or Stockhouse and Thenum or Iert. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>The Epitaph, Orama, any of those, those pieces were done by musicians in electronic music studios. So it's really a crossover art. And for me, all of 'em, the composers knew that I was, that I do sound poetry. So Elany chose to put that in. So did Bruno Liberta, which is his piece is called Sphere of Air, is Bound. That's the second piece on the, on the cd. And, we use that to huge effect. That's the, the most abstract piece that's on there. And Bruno loved what I was doing with my voice. And so there's whole sections where, where, I'm, I'm using my voice, much like the way I would use my trumpet extended techniques <span style="color:red" data-ts="2149.685" data-end_ts="2149.845" title="2149.685" id=c_"2149.685">__on__</span> the trumpet. And he's processing me again this time with a system called Akina, KYMA. And we could spend a lot of time talking about that, but we're gonna run out of time. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>But, for his score, his score is total, total graphic visual score. And I couldn't put this on there, unfortunately, just 'cause of the size. He created little gestures on, on, transparent overlays. And then he created a, another sheet with lines on it, and I would place the overlays on top of the lines and turn them. And that was my score. And there was three pages. One had little black, little black images on there, another had little green images on there. One had little yellow, red orange. And so when I was recording this for him, that's what I would just say, okay, so this is the black page, this is the orange page, this is the green page. And I would record all just an improvisation and send it to him, and then he would process it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's, yet you had another cool, documentational experience as well. Now, in looking at this, the CD project, and again, I keep on coming it back to that because it's got so many, like, fascinating angles to discuss. One of the things is, it looks like it took you a long, long time to put this together, <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Right? It it took eight years. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>What was, what was it that, that like caused it to take that long, but also what is it that allowed you to kind of like keep your momentum? Because I think a lot of people having an <span style="color:red" data-ts="2237.725" data-end_ts="2237.925" title="2237.725" id=c_"2237.725">__eat__</span> eat year long project is just almost unimaginable. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Yeah. Very, very simply. These pieces were written for me over that period of time, the earlier period of time, and I didn't feel comfortable going into the studio and recording them until after I took them around the world, you know what I'm saying? Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2256.865" data-end_ts="2257.085" title="2256.865" id=c_"2256.865">__By__</span> taking, taking them around and performing them in public. And then I, I would be able to modify my approach to a piece if I didn't see something that wasn't working. So each one of these pieces were played minimum of, I dunno, you know, half a dozen times each except for LABA's piece, you know, we did that in vi, we did that in Vienna at the, at the Kiss <span style="color:red" data-ts="2279.655" data-end_ts="2279.875" title="2279.655" id=c_"2279.655">__Kim__</span> International Symbolic Sound Event. That <span style="color:red" data-ts="2282.335" data-end_ts="2282.555" title="2282.335" id=c_"2282.335">__was__</span> every year. We did it there in, in Vienna. But everything else, Brian's piece, the last piece, system of Shadows, we worked on that for over two years, and we've performed that all over the world. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>And so that's what kept me going. Yes. What kept me going, well, the fact is I was performing these pieces over that period of time, and then I finally quit my day job. I worked in corporate America for hardware, for software companies for quite a few years. And I finally was able to leave that behind and have enough little shekels put away in a pot. So that's when I went into the studio, did all the recordings, did all the, the, the mixing, did all the mastering. Fortunately I had the record company approach me. They, they heard what I was doing with Elany, and they went to Elany and they said, well, Elany, we want another charismatic. And she goes, I just, just put one out. I I don't have time. Talk to Steven. And, and, he, this is what he's doing. So Chris Robinson called me up from, from Parma recordings and said, Elany says you got this in the, in the bag. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>And I go, well, I ain't got it in the bag yet, but it's getting there. So I had a record company in the background pulling for me to get it finished. And that was a huge impetus on the backside. So the impetus on the front side, I'm working with all these great composers, we're doing all this collaboratively. I take the pieces around the world and play them, get them to the point where I liked them. And then I got a record company supporting, well, they didn't support me. I supported them, on the backside saying, okay, we're, this is what we're gonna do. My wife, Belinda Carr, is a photographer and a visual artist. So she developed, all of the, the art for it and helped them with the, with the packaging and what it was going to look like. And so it's just, it, you know, and the backend, when people are flagging, I was just getting real excited because I was working with engineers, I was working with mastering engineers, I was working with the art, art people at, at Parma. And, and that, that kept the eight years going <laugh>. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. So given that, you have all these things, you're kind of, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2408.065" data-end_ts="2408.285" title="2408.065" id=c_"2408.065">__you__</span>, you do have kind of all three of these things, not only holding up the stool, but really interacting with each other in a very extensive way. What do you see is a future for you? What's, what's the next thing that you either add or you extend to your repertoire in your, in your, bucket of tools? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Stephen: </b>Well, Brian Belay and I are performing quite a bit together in this group called Soundproof, which also includes Pat Strange, the Widow of Alan Strange. He's a fine new music fiddle player. Brian and I've got two series that we're performing. One I mentioned earlier, A Strange Diversion, which is ULA and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2446.665" data-end_ts="2446.885" title="2446.665" id=c_"2446.665">__Kea__</span>, that continues to be developed. And I can see that there'll, I would like there to be a whole series of works based on that that'll come out, on recording. 'cause there's a lot, there's a lot to be said about those pieces and how we use ULA and the shaping of the Buka sound with the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2463.905" data-end_ts="2464.125" title="2463.905" id=c_"2463.905">__Kea__</span>. And then the, the, the sound of the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2466.865" data-end_ts="2467.085" title="2466.865" id=c_"2466.865">__Kea__</span> system itself, the digital system. So that's one. And then the next thing, we have a, a series called, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2473.825" data-end_ts="2474.045" title="2473.825" id=c_"2473.825">__the__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2474.065" data-end_ts="2474.285" title="2474.065" id=c_"2474.065">__the__</span> one piece that we're performing now is called Tessellation Rag, and that's a, a live text, sound work.

<b>Stephen: </b>And all this is on my SoundCloud, so you can go listen to it. And it, it, it uses the voice in the ways that I've talked about in live Performance being processed live, that, that's a series called Disconcerted Speech with the, with the current work on that series called Tessellation Rag that I see as having legs to go forward and coming out with an entire <span style="color:red" data-ts="2502.405" data-end_ts="2502.685" title="2502.405" id=c_"2502.405">__seat__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2502.885" data-end_ts="2503.005" title="2502.885" id=c_"2502.885">__a__</span> tire collection of text, sound <span style="color:red" data-ts="2504.885" data-end_ts="2505.125" title="2504.885" id=c_"2504.885">__works__</span>. So, so that's one area. And then the other area is simply to keep going with my horns and interactive electronics. So I'm encouraging composers out there to con to, consider after they've listened to Flamethrower to get ahold of me. And, I'm, I'm looking for pieces for flamethrower too.
