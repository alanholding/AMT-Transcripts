<b>Darwin: </b>Hey, welcome from Berlin, Darwin here. I am currently holed up in Berlin, attending the Loop conference, having a blast. It's an amazing opportunity. But beyond that, I am also really excited about this week's podcast because it represents number 200. It's quite an achievement, even if I have to say so myself. But in any case, I want to thank <span style="color:red" data-ts="27.085" data-end_ts="27.365" title="27.085" id=c_"27.085">__y'all__</span> for listening, for being part of this thing, and I want you to enjoy listening to this podcast with Morton Nik, one of the people that really inspired me to get into electronic media and electronic music. So, with that, here's Morton, and stay tuned at the end for a few things. Okay. Today I have the great opportunity to talk to somebody whose work has changed my life. His name's Morton Nik. He is a composer, performer, educator, software developer. He's done so many different things, and, so many of them were influential, on me and many people from my generation and generation since. So, with that, we're gonna say hello to Morton. <span style="color:red" data-ts="76.125" data-end_ts="76.245" title="76.125" id=c_"76.125">__Hey__</span>, Mort, how are you Doing? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Morton Subotnick: </b>Great, thanks. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Thank you so much for taking the time to have a chat with us. I really appreciate it. This is really great. Why don't we start off by having you talk a little bit about what you are currently working on? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Morton: </b>I, I'm currently, let's see, what am I currently <span style="color:red" data-ts="92.885" data-end_ts="93.085" title="92.885" id=c_"92.885">__work__</span>? I'm, I just finished a new piece that got, premiered at the Lincoln Center Festival, and I'm still working on it. So it, it is called Crowds and Power, and it's for, I've been actually working on it quite a while now. I've been developing it. It's had several incarnations, but it's a live electronics, live video and, an actor. And, it's around 50 minutes long. It's a big piece. And, I'm hoping we're supposed to do it in Japan and in Los Angeles in the, in the, the winter, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="129.205" data-end_ts="129.405" title="129.205" id=c_"129.205">__next__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="129.405" data-end_ts="129.645" title="129.405" id=c_"129.405">__next__</span> season, starting in 2018. And so I'm, if they do come through, I'm gonna redevelop that. I'm working on that. I'm finished my book, but that's <span style="color:red" data-ts="139.765" data-end_ts="139.965" title="139.765" id=c_"139.765">__still__</span> being edited now, so I'm waiting for that to come back. That's my memoir for the MIT press. And, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I heard that mentioned in, a previous interview. When is, do you know when that's scheduled to be released? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Morton: </b>Well, I was just gonna say, I, they have to first go through it. It's not finished. I mean, I, I, I have a first complete draft all the way through, but I, my guess is that there's another year's work by the time they get back and all, all the, things like, footnotes and pictures and diagrams, all of that stuff has to be added <span style="color:red" data-ts="174.025" data-end_ts="174.245" title="174.025" id=c_"174.025">__too__</span>. So at the rate we're going, it was probably another year. Okay. But at least I got the big part done. I'm finishing, a Coral piece, which is only three years overdue. And I promised it by December. So I'm trying to finish that and, develop the Silver Apples of the Moon Revisited as a tour with a DJ in Berlin. We're, we're traveling, seven or eight cities this starting, in November, actually. Oh. <span style="color:red" data-ts="203.925" data-end_ts="204.085" title="203.925" id=c_"203.925">__We__</span>, we have the documentary that's going, that, that, it, it's not a lot of work from my standpoint, but, but it's, you know, there's a lot of things, a lot of filming that's going on at this point. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure, sure. That, that's a really interesting project. I think it's, it's gotta be a little, odd though to have people documenting your life while you're still so actively living it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Morton: </b>Well, I, I prefer that than when I'm dead. <laugh> <laugh>. Good 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Point. Good point. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Morton: </b>But, yeah, it is a little, but no, it's weird. That isn't so weird for me. But, but what's weird for me is to imagine that I'm gonna be up on a screen for nine 90, <span style="color:red" data-ts="243.985" data-end_ts="244.205" title="243.985" id=c_"243.985">__but__</span> it's a full length. I don't know if it's 90, but it's, it's a full length, film. And, that's an odd sensation when I real, it sort of gives me a funny feeling <span style="color:red" data-ts="254.025" data-end_ts="254.245" title="254.025" id=c_"254.025">__of__</span> my stomach to realize that, that that's me. That's gonna be up there. I don't think all that many people are gonna look at it, so I don't have to worry about that part of it. But, but <laugh> 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So when you were telling me a little bit about this Lincoln Center thing, the crowds of power piece that you're working on, that premiered already, but you're continued to work on, you said that that's Live electronics, live video, and then an actor. First of all, the live video stuff, is it stuff you're generating or are you working? No, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Morton: </b>No, it's little. I've been working with, little man, he's a video artist from Berlin. And, we met, they commissioned the finishing of an opera that I, Jacob's room, which I have various versions of. But this is the full opera version. I mean, it's still a small but opera, but it's, it's got, I guess, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4 singers in it. And, it's a full length opera. And I had, at the time, that was, 2009, I think I had <span style="color:red" data-ts="326.665" data-end_ts="326.885" title="326.665" id=c_"326.665">__my__</span> cataracts and I couldn't hear, <span style="color:red" data-ts="330.245" data-end_ts="330.365" title="330.245" id=c_"330.245">__I__</span>, I didn't have my hearing aids yet, <laugh> and I really thought I was at the end of my life, and I made all these, these, requirements. And I, one of them was I wanted live video because that's, that's the way I've always worked. And I, it's a piece I had been working on since, 1983. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Morton: </b>There are various versions of that. And, but this was the final version, which I, I won't go into the history of it, but, but anyway, it was important to me. They've interviewed, I interviewed a bunch of people. I had just come from Paris where I was working on getting the Ann, I did a collaboration with Ann Halperin back premiered in New York in 1965, and became in, in France, became known as, the work that, that the beginnings of postmodern dance was the night we premiered that piece. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And so we started to get people wanting it, and they, we, so I was in, <span style="color:red" data-ts="391.505" data-end_ts="391.725" title="391.505" id=c_"391.505">__Ann__</span> is 10 years older than I, and her husband's 10 years older than she, and he was dying. And, and she couldn't <span style="color:red" data-ts="398.565" data-end_ts="398.685" title="398.565" id=c_"398.565">__give__</span>, come to Paris. So I ended up working with a company to develop so that they could develop it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Morton: </b>And so I was at the <span style="color:red" data-ts="405.925" data-end_ts="406.245" title="405.925" id=c_"405.925">__<inaudible>__</span> Center, and then I went to Berlin and I couldn't see, and I couldn't hear, but I was interviewing all these people, including the video guy. And then I got my, so, but I chose him, my, little man. And then I got my eyes fixed and I got my hearing aids and, looked at his work and I realized it was really fantastic. And we began to work together. And just before the, the premier, which was <span style="color:red" data-ts="433.085" data-end_ts="433.205" title="433.085" id=c_"433.085">__a__</span>, a year or so later in Austria, they wanted me to perform live with video like I used to do in the old days to promote the opera. And I said, well, I just don't do that anymore. And, I was doing laptop stuff, but, you know, I just didn't feel comfortable about doing that. And Don, <inaudible> had had made his 200 e and, and he wanted me to have it have a bunch of modules. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Morton: </b>And I said, well, I don't wanna lug things around anymore. And so I thought, oh, well, maybe I should just call Don and pick up some stuff and just take it with me and I'll just do it. So I did. And I brought a, it was a pretty big bunch of stuff I brought, but I didn't do anything with it. I just sort of made sure I could do it. And, and I had lights going and everything. And I, and I, it was patched and ready to go, but I was doing stuff with Labtop when we first concert we did was, <span style="color:red" data-ts="492.125" data-end_ts="492.365" title="492.125" id=c_"492.125">__<inaudible>__</span>. And I was at a, an art, modern art museum in, Lichtenstein, a little tiny weird country. And, the audience was, 200 people <span style="color:red" data-ts="503.115" data-end_ts="503.335" title="503.115" id=c_"503.115">__in__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="503.415" data-end_ts="503.535" title="503.415" id=c_"503.415">__a__</span>, you know, art and, galleries space sitting down. And, and, they all started cheering at the end of our performance. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Morton: </b>And they wanted an encore. I said, well, why are they, why don't they <span style="color:red" data-ts="515.125" data-end_ts="515.415" title="515.125" id=c_"515.125">__stop__</span> <laugh> <span style="color:red" data-ts="516.455" data-end_ts="516.655" title="516.455" id=c_"516.455">__<inaudible>__</span>? <span style="color:red" data-ts="516.675" data-end_ts="516.895" title="516.675" id=c_"516.675">__And__</span> they wanted an encore. I said, <span style="color:red" data-ts="517.975" data-end_ts="518.175" title="517.975" id=c_"517.975">__well__</span>, I don't know what an encore is. <span style="color:red" data-ts="519.655" data-end_ts="519.815" title="519.655" id=c_"519.655">__And__</span> I, you know, what are you, I don't know. I'm perform, I'm improvising. I don't know what an encore is. So, so, I looked over at the <span style="color:red" data-ts="527.655" data-end_ts="527.855" title="527.655" id=c_"527.655">__ULA__</span> and I thought, what the hell? I said, <span style="color:red" data-ts="530.615" data-end_ts="530.895" title="530.615" id=c_"530.615">__well__</span> go over to the thing. I'll, I'll just, I don't know what I'm gonna do. I'll just do something on the <span style="color:red" data-ts="534.735" data-end_ts="534.935" title="534.735" id=c_"534.735">__ULA__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="534.96" data-end_ts="535.16" title="534.96" id=c_"534.96">__Club__</span>. And I started going and it was like, it was like riding a bicycle. I was like, I mean, I hadn't touched <span style="color:red" data-ts="542.065" data-end_ts="542.285" title="542.065" id=c_"542.065">__for__</span> like 15 years. And, and so it was like I was back in my studio in 1966, you know, it was, it was amazing. And because we didn't have a, a plan, he was improvising and we were just playing off each other. It was a really fantastic, event. And we, we did three OnCourse, at that thing. And, and then from that point on, I've been working with him. And so it's, it's about six, seven years now. We performed all over the world. It's, it's been great. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's a, that's a great story. And it's also interesting to just, kind of imagine you choosing someone without actually being able to see their work. I mean, what did you use to sort of like, qualify 'em as the person that you wanted, spend this much time with? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Morton: </b>Right. I, I, well, I mean, I would've, it was the opera I was doing. I wasn't thinking of further, time. But I, I could see well enough, he, he had a DVD of his work that I, I got close enough to, I could see that it was good. I liked him and I liked his attitude about, about the whole thing. And, you know, 'cause we, when I was in Berlin <span style="color:red" data-ts="610.985" data-end_ts="611.205" title="610.985" id=c_"610.985">__by__</span> choosing people, we were like the director. She was the set designer and director. And, and she belongs to the art world. And, if you, if you want, you can go on YouTube at some point, and it's Jacob's Room, Nik YouTube. And you'll, you'll see the, the a seven minute clip from the premier that, that put together as a, it's not in order, someone put it together, but it is the, it is from the premier itself. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Morton: </b>And you'll see the set and the video and the, the set was turned out to be fantastic. But it was only because I, when I talked with them, they seemed to understand what I was talking about and had suggestions, which made sense. And, and they weren't bullshit, you know, they were, they were real. And I, and I did the same thing with the singers. I came in and, they flew me in a couple of times. I went through lump <span style="color:red" data-ts="663.765" data-end_ts="663.805" title="663.765" id=c_"663.765">__swimming__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="663.805" data-end_ts="664.085" title="663.805" id=c_"663.805">__like__</span> 18 to 20 singers in three or four days. I mean, it was two days here and one day there. And I picked four finally. And then I had another trip back just to listen to the four to make sure they were the right people. And they turned out to be fantastic. So, you know, it, it was a labor of love, and I really paid a lot of attention to the details. So it wasn't that I could see his work so well, I could see it well enough, but it was that combination of talking. But what I didn't know is that he was like, <span style="color:red" data-ts="697.475" data-end_ts="697.765" title="697.475" id=c_"697.475">__what__</span>? I used to do this with Tony Martin. We were, we were like, you know, a team. <span style="color:red" data-ts="702.005" data-end_ts="702.125" title="702.005" id=c_"702.005">__I__</span>, we knew each other so well. We, we really knew what we were doing. And this guy in a very short period of time became in sync with me in all kinds of ways. So that's when I decided to, to actually do more after 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I understand what you mean, this idea of finding a, a person who can not only assist you in a performance, but can actually be a real-time collaborator. That's, that's difficult. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Morton: </b>Yeah. And, that's really important because especially the way I I perform is, you know, I had, I'd made a, a commitment back in the late fifties, early sixties that I was gonna make a move to this new medium that, or media because it was more than one, that was about to be developed. 'cause it wasn't there yet. And, tried to imagine what it meant. And to me, the electronics eventually meant a record. It meant the music should be for a record. And if you went on the stage, I call it the anti-matter twin, the making a record means that it's finished and it's perfect and, and you've gotten rid of things you don't want. But what it's losing is the spontaneity, the anti-matter twin is, it's imperfect. And, you can't get rid of anything. But what you do get is the spontaneity. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Morton: </b>So you do a similar, <span style="color:red" data-ts="785.425" data-end_ts="785.645" title="785.425" id=c_"785.425">__if__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="785.765" data-end_ts="785.885" title="785.765" id=c_"785.765">__I__</span>, if I could get my studio onto the stage, I would do it. I would be working spontaneously, not developing something that was gonna be perfect. Because what I did in my studio was to do that. And then, and then in post-production technique, put the record together and, you know, edit. And I probably was one, one of the earliest people, 'cause the long playing records were just coming out. So I was probably one of the early people because later, you know, a few years later, you never had a, a spontaneous performance on a record anymore. Whether it's a OV with Symphony or whatever it was, they were gone. That wonderful Fats Waller, I guess it was a 45. I don't know what it, what it maybe is. It was a, a performance. And you have a dog barking in the, in the alleyway <laugh>. That would never last <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>No, not anymore. But it's kind of interesting to think about it because I mean, in a way, you had to define a lot of things because there just wasn't a lot of precedent for you. I mean, the work that you did as with electronics as a serious instrument <span style="color:red" data-ts="853.025" data-end_ts="853.245" title="853.025" id=c_"853.025">__and__</span> didn't really have a lot of predecessors to do, at least the way that you did it. And then you went on to do, you know, frankly, <span style="color:red" data-ts="860.145" data-end_ts="860.365" title="860.145" id=c_"860.145">__the__</span>, one of the things that always fascinated me about your work was, your use of the ghost machines, for sort of like storing and recalling, cv, which is kind of like an early sequencing kind of system. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Morton: </b>Actually when I started, there wasn't anything before it. This, this, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="880.845" data-end_ts="881.045" title="880.845" id=c_"880.845">__ULA__</span> was actually by all counts, including MOGs, the first complete concept of a, a finished thing that was analog, that could, could perform the, the MOG was almost a year later, by the time he made it, he had modules, but there was no, no integrated, concept for it <span style="color:red" data-ts="903.785" data-end_ts="904.005" title="903.785" id=c_"903.785">__and__</span> for that kind of thing. And switched on. Bach was one year later than Silver Apples, which is the first recording made. With it, there were people working with tape and a few modules there, there was a Maxwell Coffee ad that went <laugh>, little, little beef, little drops of water and things that <span style="color:red" data-ts="928.245" data-end_ts="928.365" title="928.245" id=c_"928.245">__was__</span> very popular at, at, during those days. But that was about it. It, there really wasn't anything. And, it's hard to imagine. But, you know, what we had was the people like Stockhausen and Babbitt, and, Babbitt was working with a big, mark <span style="color:red" data-ts="946.385" data-end_ts="946.605" title="946.385" id=c_"946.385">__two__</span>, the, the big and writing and doing music that was 12 tone music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Morton: </b>It was the same music he would written out that he would write for instruments, except he did it with a computer. And if you listen to ensembles, for instance, which is a piece for, I don't know how many instruments, probably 12 <laugh>. But, you know, it's sort of a square wave and which is sort of a clarinet and a sawtooth, which is sort of a bassoon. And they play faster and more, more leaps than a human being could do. So what it ends up sounding like to kids now, when I play it, it sounds like a cartoon, because because it <span style="color:red" data-ts="983.165" data-end_ts="983.285" title="983.165" id=c_"983.165">__does__</span>, it sounds like normal music, sort of like the, the cat whose arm goes out farther than an arm can go or gets squeezed, you know, it's, it, it's still a cat, you know, it's, it is really music. And the early pieces of, stock chasm were sort of, very complex, very, detailed pitch things that were studies the Etudes, the studies he did, of course, when he did the Gaon, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1009.155" data-end_ts="1009.445" title="1009.155" id=c_"1009.155">__what__</span> that, that then became something special. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Morton: </b>And, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1012.345" data-end_ts="1012.565" title="1012.345" id=c_"1012.345">__and__</span> it's right. But there was very little at that point, the commercial world had a few things, and that was it. I mean, I was, that was the reason I got involved. I, I thought, my God, everything's gonna change. It's gonna be so common that it will be, it won't even be understood because it's going to overtake everything that's happening. It won't be understood that there was a time, there wasn't like, we don't understand the time. There wasn't writing, for instance, or there wasn't language, or there wasn't a book, you know, this I was for, for music. This was the moment of the printing press. You know, we were, we were about to experience, a hundred percent auditory literacy, audio liter literacy in the world, which at that point, the only literacy you had if, if listening is literacy was up until that point, until the recording, which the, the first tape recording was in the late thirties.

<b>Morton: </b>It was so bad that, <laugh>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1076.465" data-end_ts="1076.685" title="1076.465" id=c_"1076.465">__the__</span>, the story is that this guy invented the, you know, the magnetic tape. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1081.235" data-end_ts="1081.525" title="1081.235" id=c_"1081.235">__They__</span>, sir Thomas Beam was coming to Berlin. He went to Berlin to conduct, and they introduced him to the magnetic tape and recorded his concert. And after he said, that's terrible <laugh>, he said, I don't wanna ever hear anything like that. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1094.345" data-end_ts="1094.565" title="1094.345" id=c_"1094.345">__It__</span> didn't record again until 1955 <laugh>. Oh my God. Oh, that's hilarious. That's how bad it was at that point. But what people don't really understand is that when I was starting in 19, you know, 57, 58, there was really nothing that resembles what was going to happen. It was that 1959 moment, which I recalled in a number of interviews and in the book, but it was a moment, I think it was either 59 or 60, it was before 61, where Bank of America came out with the first credit card. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Morton: </b>The transistor was used in a radio for the first time commercially, and the tape recorder had gotten cheap enough for people to buy 1955 or 56, so you could have them in your home. And, with, with those things added up to me was the vacuum tube was over. And so the technology in those days, you, 1950, late fifties, if you bought a single oscillator, if you look back <span style="color:red" data-ts="1156.445" data-end_ts="1156.645" title="1156.445" id=c_"1156.445">__there__</span>, oscillator, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1157.875" data-end_ts="1158.165" title="1157.875" id=c_"1157.875">__that__</span>, that had a, you know, the big knob on it, they still do. They go, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1161.585" data-end_ts="1161.805" title="1161.585" id=c_"1161.585">__Ooh__</span>, that was $400. And if you, if you compute that, that's close to, I'm probably $4,000 today, right? In our money today for one oscillator, that was not controllable in any, in any shape or form, except that one little thing. So if you made a studio in those days, an electronic music studio of, with that equipment, amplifiers were hundreds of dollars. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Morton: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1187.905" data-end_ts="1188.125" title="1187.905" id=c_"1187.905">__The__</span>, the vacuum tube, technology would mean a couple of oscillators, one tape recorder and, and speakers and amplifiers with $10,000. That's, you know, a hundred thousand dollars minimum today. So it just wasn't feasible. That's why there was a cologne studio, because you couldn't afford to have that in your, in your home, you know? So it was, that was the, the moment, the moment that I realized that I was playing with the San Francisco Symphony, I was a really good clarinettist, and I was, you know, doing this other stuff, and I realized that I was alive at a moment. This was about to change, right? And I could actually, I could offer my musicality if I could learn the technology and I had an aptitude for it, and develop, help develop stuff that would be challenging, that would not be the tail wagging the dog that some commercial person gives the, gives people what it is they want, because they don't know. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Morton: </b>McLuhan was a big hero for us in those days. And McLuhan has a quote that I use in my book. We walk into the future backwards, looking through a rear view mirror. And, you know, but that's all we can do, right? So, you know, if you really do get a, just an inkling of the future in a different way, a crack of the window of the, of the air, of an image of what it might be is all you can barely do at that point. So I thought, well, if I have that, I mean, I'm talking to my friends. Most, most of my people that I knew were fine art composers and musicians, and they could see only technology destroying <laugh>, everything that they ever believed in. So, you know, I thought, what if I really could do something, I would really impact it. And the, the promise I made was that I would make things that were challenging me to make them for the medium that they were. And so that, that separated making a record from being on the stage. And I really <span style="color:red" data-ts="1314.315" data-end_ts="1314.605" title="1314.315" id=c_"1314.315">__kept__</span>, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1314.845" data-end_ts="1314.965" title="1314.845" id=c_"1314.845">__I__</span> still, to this day, I, I make a real point of, the differentiation between those things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>My friends, the SKAs often talk too about this idea of almost like being honest to the medium that you're working in. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Morton: </b>Oh, yeah. Woody and I spent a lot of time together. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. I, and I'm just wondering at that time, so you were <span style="color:red" data-ts="1337.205" data-end_ts="1337.325" title="1337.205" id=c_"1337.205">__a__</span> clarinettist in a very traditional kind of musical environment. Who were the people and what were the kinds of things that were, that propelled you into, into looking at these changes in society and saying that this is gonna change art? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Morton: </b>Well, I don't know for sure because I'm just, me, you know, my favorite, my philosophic hero is Popeye the sailor who said, I am what I am. And that's all what I'm <laugh>. So I can't really tell you, but I did, I did have to deal with this just recently. 'cause <span style="color:red" data-ts="1373.225" data-end_ts="1373.445" title="1373.225" id=c_"1373.225">__the__</span> documentary people wanted me to write something about silver Apples of the Moon, and they're gonna use the liner notes, but they wanted me to write something for, for a little essay or a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1386.205" data-end_ts="1386.285" title="1386.205" id=c_"1386.205">__'cause__</span> of something. And so I did, and, and, I ended up with <span style="color:red" data-ts="1390.965" data-end_ts="1391.125" title="1390.965" id=c_"1390.965">__the__</span>, with the question that I'm asking myself in this, it's not in the book, it's just something I just did the other day. And it's a question I was asking myself. You know, I had this image <span style="color:red" data-ts="1402.035" data-end_ts="1402.325" title="1402.035" id=c_"1402.035">__that__</span>, that crack that was an image, like there would be record companies would commission <span style="color:red" data-ts="1408.125" data-end_ts="1408.405" title="1408.125" id=c_"1408.125">__work__</span> for the record. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Morton: </b>It would become the way in which electronics records were going to be. You know, I sort of knew that wasn't gonna happen, but that, that was my image. And I have it on my liner notes for Silver, apples of the Moon. And then I realized as I'm, as I'm writing this, I realized I was wrong. It was right, but the record disappeared. We don't have record players anymore, <laugh>. That's the future. And I said, and I say in this thing, I said, you know, I had a very imperfect, it was a great vision. Everybody looks at it like, oh boy, you saw the future, but it was wrong. It was imperfect. And I said, where we are now is, you know, it's all gonna be in the cloud. The, the, the record player, the object is no longer in existence. It's a, it's a cloud, and the, the speakers and the amplifier you carry with you without wires, you know, and, subways anywhere you go, I didn't see that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Morton: </b>And then all of a sudden I remembered something else, which, and I said, I don't know where the idea came from. And, and then I remembered something else suddenly, and I wrote it. And it was that in the fifties, I had an imperfect vision of the future, but I had a more perfect vision at the end of the forties because I suddenly remembered this box. My mother died around 19 84, 85. Someone sent a box from that was in storage with my name on it more. And it had things that she kept. And on the close to the top, Jonah and I were going through it, and close to the top is this handwritten course, short story I did for an English class in high school. And I was always on the edge of flunking. And then, and then when I realized I never didn't wanna flunk, so I would do something, and this is one of those things that I did. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Morton: </b>It was not even extra credit. It was supposed to be get handed in, but I got it. So it's, I would get a D and not fail. And I read it, and it's a, it's a short story that takes place in the future in first person. And I am walking down the, the streets of, I don't know if it <span style="color:red" data-ts="1533.485" data-end_ts="1533.525" title="1533.485" id=c_"1533.485">__was__</span> a town or a city in, in the future. And, I see a billboard that says one of the late Beethoven string quartets <span style="color:red" data-ts="1543.165" data-end_ts="1543.245" title="1543.165" id=c_"1543.165">__is__</span> being performed. So I walk in and I see the string quartet on the stage, but they don't have any instruments. There are four of them. There are armchair, and their, their hands to their shoulder is strapped against the, the armchair. They have music stands, and they're playing their music virtually with the muscles that their instrument that they would use for their instruments. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Morton: </b>And the audience is in armchair, also strapped around their chest. And, and, and they're, what they're getting is a mix of the neurological nerve endings of performing, because that goes to the brain and gives you what you're hearing. And that's the way it really works. And I don't remember writing this thing, and it's there. And I thought, where did I get an idea like that? I mean, <laugh>, so I don't know. This was just part of, when I was a kid, really a kid. I was in fourth or <span style="color:red" data-ts="1599.225" data-end_ts="1599.445" title="1599.225" id=c_"1599.225">__was__</span> in third grade, fourth grade. I know, I know all these things because we moved, I was in, four grade schools, two junior highs and two high schools. My parents <inaudible>. That's why my stuff was in a box somewhere, <laugh>. So I, I remember this was the beginning of my time at this particular house that we lived actually for three years. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Morton: </b>And it was around fourth grade. We had to take these tests, which turned out to be the first, the the first, I don't know if, I don't think they were IQ tests, but they might have been some, but, but they were, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1631.685" data-end_ts="1631.885" title="1631.685" id=c_"1631.685">__what__</span>, aptitude tests. We were Guinea pigs at that point. Not just us, but my generation at that of that age <span style="color:red" data-ts="1639.155" data-end_ts="1639.445" title="1639.155" id=c_"1639.155">__were__</span> the Guinea pigs of the, of this thing. I took the test and then the, and shortly after, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1644.745" data-end_ts="1644.965" title="1644.745" id=c_"1644.745">__it__</span> was a week or so later, the teacher kept me after school. Those days you had a teacher all day long after school. He said, you know, I, I, I'd like to offer you, a job. And I said, what's that? He said, I'd like to you to write short stories about any creature you want, and there'll be cliffhangers and you just keep doing it and whatever you want to do. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Morton: </b>And so make it <span style="color:red" data-ts="1669.605" data-end_ts="1669.805" title="1669.605" id=c_"1669.605">__so__</span> it's like a cliffhanger every week. We'll put a post-it on the school bulletin board. And so I chose the trap <span style="color:red" data-ts="1675.755" data-end_ts="1676.045" title="1675.755" id=c_"1675.755">__door__</span> spider, and I gave him a name. And there was always some thing at the end of each story where he was about to be killed. And then the next week, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1684.265" data-end_ts="1684.485" title="1684.265" id=c_"1684.265">__the__</span> next week, and at the end of this, and he did this with other one, other kid. And then <span style="color:red" data-ts="1688.985" data-end_ts="1689.205" title="1688.985" id=c_"1688.985">__we__</span> became a friend of mine. And then at the end of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1691.165" data-end_ts="1691.285" title="1691.165" id=c_"1691.165">__this__</span>, the year he gave the two of us an award. He gave me a book on biology that was this old book. It, it had markings in it. It had some pages that were, I thought. And he gave my friend a book on sports, brand new book on sports. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1707.105" data-end_ts="1707.325" title="1707.105" id=c_"1707.105">__But__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1707.325" data-end_ts="1707.445" title="1707.325" id=c_"1707.325">__I__</span>, I really felt, what, what did he do this for? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Morton: </b>What am I gonna do with this damn book? And <span style="color:red" data-ts="1713.905" data-end_ts="1714.125" title="1713.905" id=c_"1713.905">__it__</span> turned out it was, later in life, I realized what had happened. 'cause my mother years later, told me, I mean, I, I already had kids. She told me she was so proud this, I was telling her about this story, about this. And she said, oh, I can tell you about that. I said, you can. She said, yeah. He called me on the telephone and he said, your son has taken these aptitude tests, and he reached the 98 percentile of any age group in natural history. I didn't even know what natural history was. So that's why he gave me the, you know, to do the droid spider. And, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1750.945" data-end_ts="1751.165" title="1750.945" id=c_"1750.945">__she__</span>, he said, he needs, you should get him extra work. Somebody who can tutor him to do things. We don't have any apt, we can't do that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Morton: </b>He's just gonna get bored at school. And she said, don't tell him he has to be normal like everybody else. And she was so proud of this. And so all, all I could, an answer to your question, now, all I could think when I was in high school, if I was doing it, there must be something going that I had an aptitude for and an understanding of. I mean, evolution, all of these things have always been just, just something I've always been really interested in. And, and so it wasn't so much neuro neurological I, 'cause I don't know that I was thinking neurological, but it turns out now I know that this is actually true. It really is. The way we experience it, I must have intuited it in some way, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1803.395" data-end_ts="1803.885" title="1803.395" id=c_"1803.395">__because__</span> where you would normally see that in a science fiction thing is a band around the head, right? Right. But that doesn't give you the neurons <span style="color:red" data-ts="1810.685" data-end_ts="1810.885" title="1810.685" id=c_"1810.685">__that__</span>, that are actually causing the thing I knew from playing the clarinet actually, that it was my fingers were doing the work. You know, I, I could look at a piece of music and if you took it away from sight reading, you took it away. We actually detested this later. You take it away, you can continue playing for at least commenting on the music for 10, 15, 20 seconds even more, and be very close to what was actually going to be there, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Because the physical patterns and stuff, you could emulate 'em pretty well. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Morton: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="1840.945" data-end_ts="1841.165" title="1840.945" id=c_"1840.945">__You__</span>, you can't, you can almost not not do that. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So, but thinking about that, story really makes me think about, another part of your sort of like, the way you do your work, which is what's really important to me and is kind of important to a generation now that's kinda rediscovering electronic music, particularly through modular systems. And that is moving away or, or finding different ways than the keyboard to utilize electronic instruments. Right. And, this has always been something that's been at the core of your work is trying to express yourself. You, I think you still use like a breath controller, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Morton: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And while you have some keyboards that I think you treat as triggers, I think generally speaking, you still work, outside or beyond the, the stretch of what a keyboard provides. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Morton: </b>Yeah. That was very important to me still is it has to do with the notion that the, you know, I think it's 40,000 years ago, we found is the first fragment of a flute that we found. And so we, we've been with instruments and including the voice, of course, but, but with instruments for minimum of 40,000 years, you get from one version of an instrument to another, just gradually. And, and each culture, I I, I won't go into the details because we won't have time for that, but, but the, the thing is, after all of that time, you're passing it on and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1940.205" data-end_ts="1940.405" title="1940.205" id=c_"1940.205">__the__</span>, and so the music that you're making is, it's a feedback loop. At first. You make the instrument, and again, I'm a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1948.045" data-end_ts="1948.205" title="1948.045" id=c_"1948.045">__glue__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1948.205" data-end_ts="1948.325" title="1948.205" id=c_"1948.205">__in__</span> thing, then the instrument makes you right? And so the culture develops. And, and, and the truth of the matter is in that the kinds of instruments we have are pretty much the same from culture to culture, but the music is different because the tunings were different and so forth. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Morton: </b>So you find this combination of stuff that's universal, but you also find the fact that it isn't, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1974.265" data-end_ts="1974.485" title="1974.265" id=c_"1974.265">__it__</span> isn't absolutely natural. It, it is really formed by that interaction between the instrument you make and the, and the way you play it. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1983.865" data-end_ts="1984.085" title="1983.865" id=c_"1983.865">__The__</span> dig <span style="color:red" data-ts="1984.425" data-end_ts="1984.645" title="1984.425" id=c_"1984.425">__do__</span> is a good example of that, you know, limited. So here we are, we're reaching 1960 where we're gonna have a new technology, which, so to me, that was day zero for music, day zero plus a huge bank of of knowledge. So it, it, it's day zero. You're almost like a god at that point because you know something already, that, that you but ga day zero. And so what you <span style="color:red" data-ts="2011.725" data-end_ts="2011.965" title="2011.725" id=c_"2011.725">__wanna__</span> find, and that was what the bargain I made with myself, is this gives you the option to make any music you want, but you, because of that inability to do something brand new, that's impossible. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Morton: </b>If you're, it's hard work. And so what's gonna happen is if you have a clarinet or if you have a piano, a keyboard, and you're gonna fall back to it, and every time you fall back to it, you're taking at least two steps back. If, if you managed to get three steps, but probably two steps forward and two steps back. And so it, it will take forever to get anywhere In the meantime, if you take the typewriter, the typewriter had this, you know, the story of the typewriter. We had this wonderful keyboard, and then we typed so fast that the little mechanisms got stuck. So then they made a typewriter, which is destined to make <span style="color:red" data-ts="2064.285" data-end_ts="2064.405" title="2064.285" id=c_"2064.285">__you__</span> go slow. And we're, and we tried to, and when we got electronics, we tried to get the faster one. Nobody would take it because the, the societal inertia was too great at that point. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Morton: </b>It was just moving and it, and grasping and wanted to die, with its, with what it was, it didn't want to go anywhere else. So we've gone to the moon with it, we're gonna go to Mars with it. We're gonna go everywhere with this typewriter, with, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2089.675" data-end_ts="2089.965" title="2089.675" id=c_"2089.675">__with__</span> <laugh>. And we would do that with a keyboard, you know, it, it would just, it would go forever. And I love, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2095.445" data-end_ts="2095.605" title="2095.445" id=c_"2095.445">__in__</span> lectures that I give, I give this example and then I say, you know, so I wanted to make a new, new music, not a new old music. And then so Silver Apples comes out and I play the opening, which is all squishy, with Pitch. And then I play the First MO with the keyboard, and it's <laugh>. It wasn't even a new old, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right? It was a different old, old. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Morton: </b>It's not anything wrong with that. I mean, I, making new old instruments and playing <span style="color:red" data-ts="2126.925" data-end_ts="2127.045" title="2126.925" id=c_"2126.925">__B__</span> on electronics, I think it's fun. I think there's nothing wrong with that, but it wasn't what I wanted to do. So eventually what has happened now, when I come back to the stage now, over the last 10, 15 years, it is, I, and where the ghosting stuff came was I started, I had <span style="color:red" data-ts="2146.105" data-end_ts="2146.525" title="2146.105" id=c_"2146.105">__Bookla__</span> make me a, what was maybe one of the, certainly one of the earliest, if not the first envelope follower, so that I could use my voice as well as those, the fingertip pressure and all that to make musical gestures. I called them, I called them, energy melodies where go, that's music, the energy for some music. And then I would re record it and, and then splice <span style="color:red" data-ts="2178.435" data-end_ts="2178.635" title="2178.435" id=c_"2178.435">__out__</span>. So I would do maybe a minute or so of an improvisation that was a guided improvisation with, you know, fast, slow, whatever, and then take Paper Leader and mark off, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2190.705" data-end_ts="2190.995" title="2190.705" id=c_"2190.705">__whoa__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Morton: </b>And then put Leader there. And I had, I would go, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2194.555" data-end_ts="2194.835" title="2194.555" id=c_"2194.555">__whoa__</span>. So I think whoa. And put Leader before and after it and mark it, and then patch the entire ULA to do all the things that, that you could do with that. That was the control voltage, right? The envelope for Pitch for Everything until I got a bunch of recordings that were, you know, wonderful from the electronic standpoint, do this with, with huge patching changes. And then if you take the leader out, you have until Spring <laugh>, right? That's how until Spring was done <span style="color:red" data-ts="2230.295" data-end_ts="2230.515" title="2230.295" id=c_"2230.295">__for__</span> beginning <span style="color:red" data-ts="2230.935" data-end_ts="2231.155" title="2230.935" id=c_"2230.935">__end__</span>. And, and so what you get is a completely natural, un keyboard oriented piece of music. But now, in, in Public, I sometimes have, I've been fascinated with using Pitch in a new, new kind of way, but really pitch real beautiful, like, like a pure, and then making gestures of simply detuning it a little bit from itself until it's ready for a new pitch. And a new pitch comes silence. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2273.385" data-end_ts="2273.675" title="2273.385" id=c_"2273.385">__Whoa__</span>. You can go on a long time that way. That requires a keyboard and a breath controller. Right, exactly. So I can really detune it properly. I can get perfect intervals. And so there's, I have this whole passage I often start a concert with is, is 10 to 15 minutes, which only probably has about seven minutes of actual sound <span style="color:red" data-ts="2297.095" data-end_ts="2297.315" title="2297.095" id=c_"2297.095">__in__</span> it, these isolated pitches, which eventually at the end of the evening become melodic passage. You, you get the point there. Yeah,

<b>Darwin: </b>I do. So Sadie has come in to help us, wrap this up. This has been a fascinating talk. I wish I had another seven hours to talk to you because I have so many more questions. But it was wonderful, first of all to have a chat with you and secondly, to get some of these insights. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Morton: </b>Yeah. Maybe we can do it again in a few months or something like 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That. That's, that sounds like that'd be great. And maybe I'll get a chance to see you sometime when we're in Germany or something, so. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Morton: </b>Oh, good. Well, I have performances <span style="color:red" data-ts="2333.605" data-end_ts="2333.725" title="2333.605" id=c_"2333.605">__a__</span> third week of November in Berlin, and then March we'll be touring Europe, so, we'll be in Germany and a couple of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2340.925" data-end_ts="2341.045" title="2340.925" id=c_"2340.925">__others__</span> later. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Well, well <span style="color:red" data-ts="2342.045" data-end_ts="2342.245" title="2342.045" id=c_"2342.045">__more__</span>, thank you so much. And with that, I'm going to let you go, hang out with Sadie a little bit. Thank you so much. Yeah. And have a good day. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Morton: </b>You too. Thanks. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>All right. Bye 
</p>

<p>
<b>Morton: </b>Bye-Bye.

<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2359.315" data-end_ts="2359.805" title="2359.315" id=c_"2359.315">__Alright__</span>, and thanks to Sadie, the dog for kind of helping us put an end <span style="color:red" data-ts="2363.645" data-end_ts="2363.765" title="2363.645" id=c_"2363.645">__to__</span> that one <laugh>. It's pretty fun. So again, I want to thank you all for continuing to listen 200 podcasts. That's amazing. Given that I started this off on a kind of a <span style="color:red" data-ts="2375.325" data-end_ts="2375.565" title="2375.325" id=c_"2375.325">__lark__</span>. It's really become, quite a historical record. So it's, you're listening and, your support that's kept me going through all this. With that, I am going to sign off for the week. We have a lot of interesting stuff coming up. If you can kind of stay in tune with what we're doing here, I'd really appreciate it. Besides that, I'm gonna let you go and we'll catch you.
