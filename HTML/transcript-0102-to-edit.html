<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. Today I have the pleasure of introducing someone that I've just gotten to know recently. He was actually, flagged for me by Brian Crabtree, who was just really excited with the work that he's been doing. His name's Rodrigo Constanza <span style="color:red" data-ts="19.765" data-end_ts="19.845" title="19.765" id=c_"19.765">__Zo__</span>, and he is a maker, a maker in a very cool way. He does a lot of work in Max. That's, a lot of what I've seen of his work. But, he's been making all kinds of stuff and he has a really interesting blog on his website. And once I started getting into his work, I really wanted to interview him for the podcast. So with that, we say hello to Rodrigo. Rodrigo, how are you? How 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo Constanzo: </b>Awesome. I'm doing Great. How's it going? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="46.505" data-end_ts="46.725" title="46.505" id=c_"46.505">__Ah__</span>, it's going fine. Thanks a lot for taking the time to do this. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b>Yeah, yeah. Thank you for asking me. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now where you're located in England, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b>Yeah. I live in Manchester where I've lived with my partner for the last sort of nine years or so. Interesting. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>How do you like it over there? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b>It's pretty good. Like before this, we lived, well, basically grew up in Miami, <span style="color:red" data-ts="71.185" data-end_ts="71.405" title="71.185" id=c_"71.185">__in__</span>, in Florida, and it was all right. But for, I guess <span style="color:red" data-ts="74.045" data-end_ts="74.165" title="74.045" id=c_"74.045">__a__</span> kind of work <span style="color:red" data-ts="75.065" data-end_ts="75.285" title="75.065" id=c_"75.065">__in__</span> art that we do, <span style="color:red" data-ts="76.085" data-end_ts="76.245" title="76.085" id=c_"76.085">__that__</span> wasn't really the best place for that. Sure. So, moving to, well, England has been good for that. It's, it's a much geographically smaller country, so the communities, it's much easier to get around. Like you can get down to London in a couple hours and a lot of big nearby cities where I can get to within an hour. Sure. And then just in general, like a, a more vibrant, artistic sort of community and culture in general here. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's really cool. I think it's, I think it's often underestimated how important kind of a compressed community or a compressed population is for sort of having that kind of community growth. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b>Yeah. Especially so living somewhere <span style="color:red" data-ts="114.165" data-end_ts="114.325" title="114.165" id=c_"114.165">__in__</span> Miami where it's kind of almost geographically isolated from the rest of the country. Like, you'd have very few music acts would go all the way down to South Florida, unless it was like Madonna or something, you know, massive like that. So like, it, it was very isolated in that way. And, and then of course you like, you know, you drive 10 hours and you're still nowhere, you know? Sure. Whereas here, like 30 minutes on a train and, and that's, it's a different city with different people in it and doing different things, and that, that really sort of changed, how I view things. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, absolutely. That makes a lot of sense. This also answered another question, which is that you are UK based, but, you don't speak like you're from England. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b><laugh> <laugh>. No. No. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So I appreciate you kind of clearing that up a little bit. Thanks. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b>Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Well first before I go into your background and stuff, why don't you kind of fill, the listeners in on the kind of work that you've been doing? What some of your, what some of your work looks like? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b>I mean, I, I guess nowadays it's been a lot of sort of inter like mixed media, <span style="color:red" data-ts="177.925" data-end_ts="178.045" title="177.925" id=c_"177.925">__a__</span> lot of videos and music, combined. So a lot of music and art, a lot of software and programming and instrument making. It's, it's kind of like a big mishmash of, of stuff where I'm kind of involved in a lot of the different aspects of it from making instruments to composing, to performing, to yeah. Doing kind of the whole sausage worth of stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><laugh>. Right. <span style="color:red" data-ts="202.785" data-end_ts="203.005" title="202.785" id=c_"202.785">__It__</span>, well, it's interesting though because more and more it seems like all particularly performers are being drawn into all sorts of strangely mixed media, but we've also all kind of become software developers at the same time. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b><laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's kind of bizarre. So, I'm always curious with people who have really kind of a diverse, a diverse world of artwork under their fingers. I like to hear about where they've come from, what it is that made them, the artists that they've become, as well as how they came to be comfortable with technology. So can you fill me in a little bit on that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b>Yeah, I mean, I, I guess for me, like my, my background in a, in a general way was sort of a, a per like, performer, kind of like a regular performer. Grew up doing classical piano and, and, and university guitar and piano and, and this kind of stuff, in, in a sort of pretty solidly classical world. And then alongside of that, from like being a teenager on really got into playing in bands and, and kind of doing music that, I guess my parents didn't like, you know, that that sort of gave me an into that. And then from that, it was kind of, if I had to pick probably a point of entry, I'd, I'd probably, oddly enough be like maybe guitar pedals, I don't know. Like <span style="color:red" data-ts="280.485" data-end_ts="280.605" title="280.485" id=c_"280.485">__at__</span>, at some point I got really interested in DIY stuff and I, I popped into like a bookstore at the time, and I got this fantastic book, grab chords, power <span style="color:red" data-ts="289.045" data-end_ts="289.285" title="289.045" id=c_"289.045">__Phones__</span> and Worley. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b>Yes. I think those order the words, from the Wind World, Bart <span style="color:red" data-ts="293.765" data-end_ts="293.965" title="293.765" id=c_"293.765">__Hopkins__</span>. And that book like really blew my mind. Like it, from there I got into like circuit bending and all of these kinds of electronic instrument type approaches. So at the time I wasn't messing with software yet, so it was, it was mainly building instruments or building pedals or modifying toys and this kind of stuff. And then, this was around early max four era. I kind of, a friend of mine got Max and <span style="color:red" data-ts="320.365" data-end_ts="320.485" title="320.365" id=c_"320.365">__I__</span>, I kind of saw it and it was, it was really mystifying, you know, but it, it seemed much more approachable than say, you know, regular programming, which was, you know, seemed far beyond what I could get into at the time. And I had kind of like a, I wouldn't say love <span style="color:red" data-ts="337.155" data-end_ts="337.395" title="337.155" id=c_"337.155">__hate__</span>, but like an on off relationship with Max for a long time where like, what I really wanted to do with Max was, sort of live sampling and, <span style="color:red" data-ts="345.075" data-end_ts="345.195" title="345.075" id=c_"345.075">__and__</span> audio manipulation, which is not the easiest stuff to do right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b>When you start off. Right. Or at least back then for, for me, I found that to be the case. Sure. So I'd kind of go, I'd, I'd, I'd like go through a period of six months hardcore, like doing the tutorials and all this, and then get frustrated and like not touch it for two years or a year. And I did this like maybe three or four times. And then the last time stuck and then that sort of took me to where I am with, with software, but I, I guess all of these strands were going independently of each other. And it wasn't <span style="color:red" data-ts="374.365" data-end_ts="374.565" title="374.365" id=c_"374.365">__till__</span> moving till to England that, I kind of started putting these pieces together where I started, okay, well if I'm, 'cause I also composed and, and did that kind of formally through study <span style="color:red" data-ts="387.345" data-end_ts="387.565" title="387.345" id=c_"387.345">__as__</span>, okay, so if I'm composing for myself as a performer using these instruments that I've made and or software, what's the, what's my relationship to all of these parts of the process? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b>And it kind of collapsed the whole thing <span style="color:red" data-ts="401.045" data-end_ts="401.245" title="401.045" id=c_"401.045">__where__</span>, as opposed to, I guess at, at the time, I very much felt that I had separate hats. So I had like an instrument maker, software maker hat, and then that role finished, and then I, then I would take it to like performer hat and I would do that, or, or composer hat. And I would kind of hand the creative process off to each of the individual versions of me. Sure. And they would all contribute their own thing. And it, you know, I enjoyed the stuff I did, but it wasn't until I really thought about it and collapsed that stuff and realized that there wasn't, <span style="color:red" data-ts="429.215" data-end_ts="429.565" title="429.215" id=c_"429.215">__there__</span>, there weren't these clear divisions that it was just one continuum that you're just passing the, the creative act around between different, like juggling it. I don't know. It's probably not a good way to put that, but, that kind of really changed my relationship to all of this stuff. <span style="color:red" data-ts="448.425" data-end_ts="448.645" title="448.425" id=c_"448.425">__And__</span> technology included just made kind of a, a more integrated way to come at things creatively. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That makes a lot of sense. Now, other people have kind of talked about collapsing the different sort of personalities they have or different hats that they have to wear. It, it tends to collapse to a different level. Right. So sometimes people, kind of collapse the instrument building and coding into something that looks like a modified Arduino and other people collapse it all the way down to the point that they're doing live coding as their performance. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, what does your collapse look like? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b>I mean, I guess my collapse is more, I mean, I guess if it, I, I guess when you were phrasing that I thought like, you know, I was falling up. But I, I guess it's a different thing in that I, I guess you, you, you choose your level of how far down you're willing to go. Right. So for example, I, I, I write software, but I, I, like, my floor is generally max, or now it's like going <span style="color:red" data-ts="514.385" data-end_ts="514.545" title="514.385" id=c_"514.385">__to__</span> externals a little bit, but I don't go all the way down to like, I'm not writing anything in c Sure. You know, and, and I'm not like, going down and cutting a tree for a bit of wood either there. So there's like a, there, there's a, there's a floor which you, you kind of, I don't wanna say pragmatically choose, but there's a floor at which you're like, okay, this is, this is where I'm okay to, to function. 'cause obviously I could, you know, you could break that down quite a bit lower. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But there's also sort of like an efficiency thing because you only have so much time and sometimes going down to these really low floors ends up being really time consuming and kind of a time suck, don't you think? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b>Oh, absolutely. Like, I, I, I feel kind of lucky in a way that independent of, of like writing software and then using it to make music, I kind of enjoy the, the, the hobby ness of it or the craft of it. Like, I, like, same thing with making instruments. I kind of enjoy like just putting like weeks or months into kind of like, making this thing which I then later <span style="color:red" data-ts="571.545" data-end_ts="571.765" title="571.545" id=c_"571.545">__use__</span> to make music with as well, which is satisfying. But I kind of like the, that that slow hum of that process as well. So the, I don't know if that's maybe unusual or atypical. So maybe someone who, who juggles these things finds like, oh, I've gotta do a bit of code for this thing that I need and I'd rather not do it. It's kind of a pain in the butt to, to go through that time. But I kind of like that, the craft of it too. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So. Well that's, that's a really cool way of putting it, the craft of, of the creation. Because I think that one of the things that maybe I consider a little bit unfortunate is that, and this is especially related to code, but oftentimes is related to instrument building or circuit building or circuit bending or whatever, is that people are really quick to want to professionalize their work, right? Mm-Hmm. And, where I think that sometimes having it having more of a craft or artisan <span style="color:red" data-ts="632.885" data-end_ts="633.125" title="632.885" id=c_"632.885">__like__</span> view of the thing that you're doing ends up allowing you to make sort of a more personal and idiosyncratic thing in the end. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b>Yeah. <span style="color:red" data-ts="641.485" data-end_ts="641.605" title="641.485" id=c_"641.485">__I__</span>, I, I definitely agree with that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So speaking of personal things, let's talk about the party Van <laugh>. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b><laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>First of all, great name, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b>Thank you, <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>But secondly, that was the, when, when I was looking up your work, all of a sudden I saw you were responsible for the party van. I'm like, oh, well I've run across this guy before then. Right? Yeah. Because I remember when that was, when you first kind of like, put that out in the world. It was pretty, it was pretty exciting stuff. Can you explain a little bit about what it is and then talk a little bit about its development? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b>Yeah, so I guess essentially it's an all-in-one sort of performance or maybe creative technology environment or kind of instrument. I think of it more as an instrument. But that's typically 'cause I perform with it. But it's a kind of an all-in-one software grab bag of all the things I find interesting. I guess maybe that's a, a crude summary, but it has a lot of live sampling and processing a lot of DSP, some synthesis. Not a lot of that, but, mainly oriented towards the capture and playback of audio in a performance setting. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. How did that, how did it come about is, 'cause it, it seems to me like there's, you know, when I read through your blog, you were kind of influenced by some, a little bit of wacky hardware, but just also by trying to do this looping functionality in, a convenient way for you. How did, what were all the things that came together to end up making the party band software? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b>Yeah, I, I, I guess one of the things that when I started this was the last batch that finally stuck of like my cycles of on and off max, that I kind of had a clear idea of what I wanted to do. And at the time I was using, a hardware sampler. So it was this sampler called the Where's the party at Sampler. So it was an eight bit, lo-fi kind of, you had, I believe 12 seconds of sampling time, one of those kind of kit things. Sure. And I was using that, in this special little hardware box that I had built to perform with. And I, I was doing a lot of gigging with it, and I wanted to update that. I wanted to add some new features to it and, and expand what I was, how I was using it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b>So I thought, well, rather than get into like a pretty complicated Arduino based project where I'd have to work out LLCD screens and this kind of thing, I thought, well, it's probably easier to do it in Max. And I kind of know Max a little bit at the time. So I, I, I essentially had a, a feature set of what I wanted to do and started trying to build that, the software or the, the PIs, the bit of hardware, the, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="809.195" data-end_ts="809.355" title="809.195" id=c_"809.195">__where__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="809.355" data-end_ts="809.515" title="809.355" id=c_"809.355">__the__</span> party <span style="color:red" data-ts="809.635" data-end_ts="809.835" title="809.635" id=c_"809.635">__had__</span> sampler had some kind of idiosyncratic features of how it worked. There was like a, a global clock that affected everything, like system wide. It would shuffle the buffer for you in a, in a weird way and let you move around things and in some not typical sampler manners. So I just started trying to build that stuff in <span style="color:red" data-ts="827.455" data-end_ts="827.675" title="827.455" id=c_"827.455">__Max__</span>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b>And then from there, well, once I decided that I wanted to figure out what I wanted to do for a controller, and already at the time I kind of had some, you know, relatively strong ideas of, of, of what I thought about controllers and what I thought about using an interface in a performance setting. And I didn't want, like a fader box. I didn't want a box of knobs and a box of faders. Sure. I didn't wanna have like one of those little microcog things, <laugh> that, that just like required me to micromanage things. I didn't want to know what the, the reverb decay time was. I didn't want that to be like, you know, in 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Your face Yeah. In your face, yeah. While you're performing, right. Yeah. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b>So I thought about different interfaces and I was looking at some of the fader fox stuff and, and then <span style="color:red" data-ts="872.875" data-end_ts="872.995" title="872.875" id=c_"872.875">__a__</span>, a friend of mine had a mono, so I, I went over to his place and I hadn't really ever played on one and I had to go on it, and I, I <span style="color:red" data-ts="878.795" data-end_ts="878.955" title="878.795" id=c_"878.795">__kinda__</span> liked it and I kind of came up as a pianist, so I, I figured I had some kind of dexterity there. Sure. And it's kind of a, a box of buttons, and I liked how open it was. And then I also found <span style="color:red" data-ts="891.105" data-end_ts="891.325" title="891.105" id=c_"891.105">__the__</span>, their general, approach to business, like <span style="color:red" data-ts="894.765" data-end_ts="894.885" title="894.765" id=c_"894.765">__the__</span> ethics, all that stuff was quite agreeable. So I was like, okay, this is something I can get into. Right. So I settled on an interface, which was a <span style="color:red" data-ts="901.485" data-end_ts="901.685" title="901.485" id=c_"901.485">__mono__</span>, and then planned out from there. And then over the years it's, I, it's maybe even four years now. I, I keep adding things to it and expanding the kinds of things that it does into some pretty complex stuff. Some like not stubborn stuff you can't really do off the shelf easily anywhere else. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So you seem to be quite fascinated by looping and real-time recording and stuff. What do you feed into this system, when you're doing performance? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b>It, it varies. So I, I guess one of the reasons why I'm, I'm quite drawn into live sampling is that I'm, I'm still quite like an instrumentalist at heart. Uhhuh often <span style="color:red" data-ts="939.635" data-end_ts="939.925" title="939.635" id=c_"939.635">__that__</span> this means playing with an instrument. So these days it's often percussion or drums. But for a long time it was also guitar and piano and software in the mix. So I'll often use a software alongside, an instrument or an instrument I've made, but some kind of a non-software, typically non-software based instrument. And then the party band or whatever software I'm using is just augments that. So a big interest for me was the, that capture and process type approach to using a computer. So yeah, normally I'll have, let's say these days, as I said, it's, <span style="color:red" data-ts="973.285" data-end_ts="973.405" title="973.285" id=c_"973.285">__I__</span>, I'll have like a snare drum in a lot of objects. Okay. And then next to me, I'll have the <span style="color:red" data-ts="976.685" data-end_ts="976.805" title="976.685" id=c_"976.685">__modern__</span> controllers. Laptop is usually like at my feet with the screen dimmed. And then I just play using that, just capturing the sounds from whatever acoustic or, or DIY instrument I'm using at the, at the time. I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>See, you know, going all the way, kind of going back, you, you really came from a music focus and, with the entry of this one book, you became sort of a hardware hacker kind of Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But did you find, did you have any difficulty like translating your experiences as a musician into working with whether it was DIY hardware boxes or, or guitar pedals? I mean, did you see it, did you feel any particular struggle in taking on technology? Or did it seem really natural to you? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b>I, I, I think like, it was kind of natural other than the, the, the general things of syntax and, and the difficulty in learning, say like a programming language or, you know, resistor values and formulas. Other than that kind of stuff, which is usually have to kind of push through anyways. There's, I think perhaps something in being a musician where there's maybe a, a semantic fetishism, like where you're already, you're very careful about certain things. And that I think, at least it was in my experience, that that translated pretty well to software. You know, so you have to consider cases and, and what if this happens this way and this happens this way? Is a kind of thinking that, for me felt kind of natural because as an, as a composer, a performer, these are considerations you have anyways. So I'm gonna do this, or I'm gonna do this and this will have ramifications this way. Right. So it it's a kind of a semantic, attunement that, well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, I've never really thought about it that way, but, but that's actually pretty brilliant to, to consider that if you think about it as a musician, especially one that's used to reading music, you're used to this concept of like almost a symbolic abstraction. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And also the concept of thinking through the performance of something that is notated in some other way. So if you think about, musical scores being sort of like a circuit diagram for a performance that actually is, that does seem to be a lot of parallels there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b>Yeah. Yeah. And I, I hadn't really thought about it till just sort of putting it that way, but I, I think it didn't feel especially foreign. Yeah. Other than like, as I said, having to actually do the, you know, okay, this type of loop does this and learning like the actual rules or the grammar of it, that took a, some adjustment as as going from, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1137.755" data-end_ts="1137.975" title="1137.755" id=c_"1137.755">__you__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1137.975" data-end_ts="1138.135" title="1137.975" id=c_"1137.975">__know__</span>, learning one instrument <span style="color:red" data-ts="1138.735" data-end_ts="1138.935" title="1138.735" id=c_"1138.735">__or__</span> learning another instrument. There's physical things, physical adjustments you have to make, make up the, the actual translation process. Right. But the, the, the type of thinking I think wasn't, wasn't especially different. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Did you find it easier to work with hardware or easier to work with software? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b>I don't know. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1156.775" data-end_ts="1156.895" title="1156.775" id=c_"1156.775">__I__</span>, I guess with hardware I was more hacky as in like, it was more circuit bend, non theoretically oriented. So it was more just poking around and, and messing with things to get things going. Whereas with software, I've kind of, it, it's a little bit more theoretical as in like, my, my knowledge base in, in software programming is, is much higher than it is with hardware. Sure. So like, I'd have a harder time designing a circuit from scratch than I would programming something from scratch. But I think that has to mainly do with my point of entry and the time that I spent with it. So I kind of got into circuit bending and making pedals and that was a very tinkering type thing that I was doing Right. And that, that did what I wanted. But then when I got into software, I guess with Max, it's, when I started off anyways, it was, it was quite tinkering as well, just getting bits of other people's patches and why does this work this way? And, you know, okay, what if I add this here? I've broken the whole thing. Okay, hold on, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1214.015" data-end_ts="1214.175" title="1214.015" id=c_"1214.015">__lemme__</span> do this. And it was kind of tinkering, but then, then I guess I tinkered at it long enough to, you know, have a look underneath the hood as well. Sure. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. So one of the things that caught a lot of attention in the, in the Max community, was the development of an object called the Karma Tilda Object, which I think you worked with Raja on, is that correct? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. What was, what's the story behind that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b>So, at the time I was, I had started working on Cut <span style="color:red" data-ts="1245.535" data-end_ts="1245.775" title="1245.535" id=c_"1245.535">__Love__</span>, which is a software that came out earlier this year. And my idea for that was having, you know, a gamepad based live sampling thing. So that was what I, I wanted to build. And I had a lot of, I put a lot of time and energy to that. But I had gotten to a point in the development of that where the, the core sampling aspect of that patch needed something more complex than what I had with, vanilla Max objects. It was essentially, I wanted to be able to have very speed recording and have position <span style="color:red" data-ts="1275.765" data-end_ts="1275.925" title="1275.765" id=c_"1275.765">__and__</span> window control while recording. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And that was, you know, once you get at that point, you're, you're really dealing with at sample accurate kind of thing. So it needed to be, you know, well, I, I wanted to go to an external with it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b>Sure. And I had spoken to some, I'm good friends with Alex Harper, and he, he's <span style="color:red" data-ts="1293.285" data-end_ts="1293.525" title="1293.285" id=c_"1293.285">__made__</span> a lot of externals. And I had talked to him about this and, through those conversations with him and my supervisor, PA Trembley at University of Hunters <span style="color:red" data-ts="1300.925" data-end_ts="1301.045" title="1300.925" id=c_"1300.925">__Field__</span>, it was, it was clear that it was pretty heavy stuff. Yeah. So doing like, any kind of sampling and, and the cross fades and, and having things be click free is not, not a walk in the park. Right. So I, I knew what I wanted and I knew what I needed and I had a, a fairly solid sort of feature spec written out. But I knew some of that was over my head actually. A lot of that was over my head to, to do it in an external. And Alex couldn't do it at the time. He was too busy with other projects. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b>And I had seen Raja, like he uses <span style="color:red" data-ts="1334.645" data-end_ts="1334.805" title="1334.645" id=c_"1334.645">__modern__</span> stuff as well. So we've, we've spoken to each other on, on various forums and we've kind of known each known of each other's work. So I messaged him and I asked him if he'd be interested in taking it on, like, as a, as like a commission, like a paid project where I'd, this is what I need built and could you build this? 'cause I knew he did that kind of stuff for people. Right. And we kind of started hacking away at it, and we worked on it maybe, I mean, we, he, he did a lot of coding, and then just sending prototypes back and then massaging things and, okay, this should work this way, this should work that way. And it was quite protracted development process. So maybe like six months or so. I don't know. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b>It, it took a while. And then yeah, we had finished it and then Yeah. That eventually went back into cut glove and putting together actually, well, it's kind of a funny thing. We had finished Karma, or we got it to like a, a version like the final beta and, you know, there was always like small little things you catch. So we're at this point where it's released ready, the, the, the help file was thorough and kind of ready, but still ironing out some last details. And I wanted to make a really good tutorial video. I wanted to make something that kind of was interesting independently of being a tutorial video. Right. So, started working on that, which took, that took like three months on its own as well, <laugh>. Sure. Okay. But yeah. And then, and then finally put it out earlier this year. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. And so then that was developed for your most recent software cut glove. Yeah. How is that? Well, first of all, what is it, sec, because I haven't played with it, unfortunately not yet. But, mainly because it uses an Xbox 360 controller. Right. Yeah. Why'd you choose the 360? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b>Well I have, I had an Xbox 360, and I, I liked the ergonomics of, I've always, I mean, I grew up playing video games, so like Nintendo and all that kind of stuff. And, then as an adult, a bunch of my friends got into playing Halo and stuff like this on the original Xbox. So I got really comfortable with playing an Xbox type controller. Right. And then, yeah, I got my own system and it, it's well built. It, it's ergonomic and I, I, at least in my hands, feels significantly more comfortable than something like a PlayStation controller. Sure. Okay. And I had used, like Alex Harker had done some stuff with Gamepad stuff, and he had used some generic, I dunno, like the, I don't even remember the <span style="color:red" data-ts="1485.165" data-end_ts="1485.325" title="1485.165" id=c_"1485.165">__brands__</span>. Like if <span style="color:red" data-ts="1485.845" data-end_ts="1485.885" title="1485.845" id=c_"1485.845">__you__</span> would just walk into like a, a, a regular shop and buy and not Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Logitech or 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b>Yeah, like a log Right. Kind of thing. And I had used it and it just didn't feel good. So, I guess the, the development of, of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1498.165" data-end_ts="1498.365" title="1498.165" id=c_"1498.165">__ve__</span> I was just sat home one day just playing, I don't re UFC video game, I think was the one. And just, I looked down at my hands and my hands were doing like all this ninja stuff. Like, it was these really complex moves where you have to hold this button while spinning this button and then you release this. It was pretty complex. And I had just become second nature, just, I've been playing <span style="color:red" data-ts="1518.365" data-end_ts="1518.565" title="1518.365" id=c_"1518.365">__the__</span> game and I thought like, well, for one, you know, as a musician, I have all this latent dexterity. Right. Like my hands are kind of these tools that can do this complex stuff. Sure. And video games, this, this controller is designed to be ergonomic and efficient and to work this way. So I can just take that and, and take video game paradigm and approaches and, and mechanics and, and apply this to a performance instrument. Right. And then that's what came of that. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And so now is this another, kind of loop oriented device or <span style="color:red" data-ts="1550.755" data-end_ts="1551.045" title="1550.755" id=c_"1550.755">__Yeah__</span>. Does it have more generation? I 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b>Mean, it, it doesn't have, yeah, like most of the stuff I do is generally typically like capture and process. Right. So there's no synthesis on its own. And when you load up the patch, it has, there's nothing, not even preset loaded. It's meant to use, it is like an instrument. You take your guitar to the case and it's not doing anything yet. So it's that kind of mentality. So it's, it's live sampling oriented and, and DSP processing of, of signal Sure. Oriented. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Now, I'm curious about something, because the, the much of what you talk about is related to using some sort of physical interface into software, but you also very much talk about yourself as being a kind of classic performer in terms of using an instrument. How do you keep one from getting in the way of the other? I mean, I, I started off as a guitar player, and you know what, it's actually kind of tiresome to be a guitar player and also be trying to use a mono or a fader box or a mouse or any of this stuff. It ends up being a, a juggling act in a not very artistic way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b>No, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1626.565" data-end_ts="1626.685" title="1626.565" id=c_"1626.565">__I__</span>, I, I definitely agree there. And I think for a lot of me, like a lot of what I do anyways, the interest is that that little gray area, so that between human and technology, that aspect of it, or between performance and composition or between improvisation and performance, like these little areas where they're, the roles are generally more segregated. So I, for me, I kind of find those areas really interesting. And then, and then that's where I tend to jump in. So in this case, the using, software and an instrument. So instrument in this case, meaning either an acoustic instrument or ADIY, whatever. Okay. There's a couple different solutions I've done for that. The <span style="color:red" data-ts="1663.845" data-end_ts="1664.005" title="1663.845" id=c_"1663.845">__couple__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1664.005" data-end_ts="1664.205" title="1664.005" id=c_"1664.005">__of__</span> is <span style="color:red" data-ts="1664.425" data-end_ts="1664.645" title="1664.425" id=c_"1664.425">__an__</span>, a unique one in that it, by the design of, of what a gamepad works is, is almost like exclusive. So like if I try to use it with another instrument, I, it's nearly impossible. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b>Like it takes up both of your hands. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1676.385" data-end_ts="1676.605" title="1676.385" id=c_"1676.385">__You__</span> like, I, I can't do that. Well, and that's, that's how it's sort of designed. I guess my feet are still free, but, you know, I haven't learned to play anything that well with my feet yet, you know? Sure. So with that one, that's kind of, if I'm playing <span style="color:red" data-ts="1689.385" data-end_ts="1689.605" title="1689.385" id=c_"1689.385">__cut__</span> glove, I'm usually, that's what I'm doing. I'm using a controller and then I'm performing with someone else. But typically, if I'm using, let's say the mono controller, the way that I designed my general sort of design approach in Party Van was to have analysis based preset and, and parameter modification happening that's behind the scenes. So as a performer, I, I, I have two big knobs that are kind of these macro things. So I, at the same time with that, I didn't want it to be real vanilla. So essentially constantly running audio analysis is, is happening on audio input and also on all the buffers that you record. And then that determines parameters for any, so if you turn an effect on the parameters are, are tuned to whatever was in the buffer or whatever, the audio's coming in. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Okay. That makes a lot of sense. That's a really interesting way to do it. And I, I frankly, I haven't seen a lot of people using analysis as a control function to keep their hands free. That's pretty smart. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b>Yeah. Yeah. And <span style="color:red" data-ts="1746.925" data-end_ts="1747.045" title="1746.925" id=c_"1746.925">__it__</span>, it's, it's worked well in that a lot of it is, it is automated and it, it isn't too, like I'm, I'm starting to think about like the party van two now. Like I've, I've just gotten one of the new <span style="color:red" data-ts="1755.765" data-end_ts="1755.965" title="1755.765" id=c_"1755.765">__modern__</span> controllers, and I'm brainstorming at the back of my head for that. But I tend to do a lot of things with automated things. So I'll, I'll put it in a mode and then based like on audio attack detection, it'll start recording or stomp recording placed with other analysis based parameters. So I, I'm essentially micro, like not micromanaging, I'm micromanaging the software system. Right. So exactly. Like I didn't want to have control over like reverb, you know, decay. It's, so I went the complete opposite way. I have like one macro knob that like, just turns things up. It's just kind of like an upness or a downness or that, that kind of much, much more abstracted control. Okay. Which then leaves me mentally and physically free to do things as a performer. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Oh, that's, that's awesome. That's a really smart, smart approach to working with that kind of stuff. So you kind of mentioned it here, and I was going to ask, if you had worked much with, with other people on these performances. I have a friend Mark, and he uses an Okta <span style="color:red" data-ts="1815.445" data-end_ts="1815.645" title="1815.445" id=c_"1815.445">__track__</span> for sort of like real time sample capture and playback, but it's so involved that he often, he focuses on working that while he works with other musicians who are sort of like playing and then he'll capture and swing off of that. Sounds like you do that a little bit as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b>Yeah. Yeah. So often, so with Party <span style="color:red" data-ts="1835.125" data-end_ts="1835.365" title="1835.125" id=c_"1835.125">__band__</span>, I, I tend to do a lot of solo performance, although it's my Go-to for other things. Okay. But I'd say maybe 70% of when I perform is solo. So it'll be just me and the, the party band. But for the rest of the time, I, I, I have a, a bunch of people I play with in typically a lot of, a lot of groups. So I have like a, a smallish, set of people that I play with regularly. So, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1858.905" data-end_ts="1859.125" title="1858.905" id=c_"1858.905">__PA__</span> Trembley, Sam Andre, Alex Harkers, a bunch of the guys that I've mentioned kind of in software stuff. And then there's a quite vibrant improv community here in, in Manchester. Anyway, so there's a lot of people here that I, that I play with. And I, I co-run a, a night with someone called Anton Hunter that we put on an improv oriented night. And a lot of that stuff is, is very improv oriented. So I'll be working with, let's say Sam Andre, and he's playing sax, he's a sax player. And I'll have couple <span style="color:red" data-ts="1887.005" data-end_ts="1887.205" title="1887.005" id=c_"1887.005">__of__</span>, and I'll just be sampling what he's doing and, and manipulating and playing back and in a, and as I would if I was playing drums or any other instrument along with them. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. One, one of the problems with people who do that kinda stuff, and even if it's controller based, but I would think, especially with a, with a joystick as your primary controller, how do you make it look like you're engaged with the performer that you're working with rather than kind of doing the drooling? I'm playing Madden kind of a look. You know, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b>That, that's an interesting one. And particularly with a game pad. So let's, normally, let's say if I'm playing an instrument, I'm not, I'm not the most, I'm emotive performer in the world, nor nor am I just, you know, I'm not dry either. I kind of fall somewhere in the middle in terms of, spectacle, I guess. Right, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1932.605" data-end_ts="1932.725" title="1932.605" id=c_"1932.605">__right__</span>. To, to use that term. The game <span style="color:red" data-ts="1934.645" data-end_ts="1934.845" title="1934.645" id=c_"1934.645">__pad__</span> is a funny one. And, you know, I've done several videos with it and 'cause it, it, it is designed to be, non performative, right? Like you're meant to kind of sit there in front of your screen and just kind of have as a little movement as possible. Like, that's the, the design ethos of, of that is to just sort of be still. Right. And I guess through years of having it, like I tend to kind of sit and then <span style="color:red" data-ts="1958.725" data-end_ts="1958.885" title="1958.725" id=c_"1958.725">__it__</span>, it leaves me in, in a, in a funky place. I still haven't figured out how I'm, I'm negotiating that. 'cause it, normally if I'm playing another instrument, my eyes are doing things related to that. Right. I'm looking around as I normally would, or I have my eyes closed, but I'm not thinking about something else. But if I'm just using a game pad, I'm, I'm not gonna just stare at them. 'cause that's kind of weird. I'm <laugh> not gonna, I'm not gonna, you look like 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>A stalker, right? <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b>Yeah. Like I see what you're doing. I don't, I don't need to see the screen. 'cause I've designed it in a way that that's not a, an issue and I don't need to see the controller either. So that only really leaves me one, like the sort of closed eyes daydreamy kind of thing. Right. Which I kind of do a bit, but thankfully I don't generally care so much what I look like when I play. Well, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's, that's probably important because to me, if I did that, I would be so self-conscious about either like, doing so much finger ninja stuff that I start drooling on myself. Yeah. <laugh> or else just, you know, looking like a zoner. And I would be so self-conscious. It would be really hard to use that as an instrument <span style="color:red" data-ts="2017.885" data-end_ts="2018.165" title="2017.885" id=c_"2017.885">__there__</span>, you know? Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b>Yeah. I mean this is, this is a new one for me just 'cause it's, it is like essentially disembodied, you know? Right. Like, it's just its own thing. So I'm, I'm still thinking about that and, and how I deal with it, but it's, up to this point, it's been, yeah, I, I kind of look like I'm just sat there and I'm, I'm still kind of on the stage, but like, I'm just kind of sat there. I don't know, maybe the, maybe the answer is I won't be on stage. I don't know. <laugh>, it, it's, there's a thing there, which I haven't, I haven't put that much energy into, but it's, it's definitely, a little awkward, I guess <span style="color:red" data-ts="2046.645" data-end_ts="2046.765" title="2046.645" id=c_"2046.645">__I__</span>, I, I can summarize it. Is that Sure. That 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Makes sense. So, one of the things that a lot of people do in that kinda situation is kind of having, having a heavy duty visual system. Have you ever done, have you ever done any work on visuals at all? Sort of in conjunction with your performance? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b>Yeah. Yeah. I've got, quite a few pieces that I use. DMX lights that are just computer controlled. So I'll, I'll typically use these to make videos. So it's typically, so my partner Angela <span style="color:red" data-ts="2078.775" data-end_ts="2079.125" title="2078.775" id=c_"2078.775">__Guyon__</span> is she makes art in videos. So we make these collaborative videos together. So it'll be me improvising with some software, some instrument I've made. And then there's typically some kind of visual component, either as part of the video making process or let's say like DMX lights that are computer controlled, that are involved in the process. I haven't done anything with projected stuff as such. We did stuff, stuff like that some years ago. But it was essentially, we didn't have DMX lights yet, so it was, the projector was just one big color field. I see. So it wasn't, it wasn't doing anything like that actually required a projector. That was just what we had. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. You know, a lot of times though, I really liked that kind of stuff. I remember way back when Jeremy Bernstein was doing things where at first it wouldn't even look like anything was happening, but it would do slow transitions and stuff. And in a way that allows you to kind of build your own narrative where if you have an active video thing, it provides you a narrative and it kind of takes some of the creativity away from the audience. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b>It's a tricky one. 'cause it's probably not narrative, so not in that kind of quadrant, but it's, it's tied in with the, the musical language, which is often improvised. Right. And that's intrinsically, since it's time-based, there's some kind of process happening. Sure. And you hear moments in time change and there is a, some type of narrative, but <span style="color:red" data-ts="2160.325" data-end_ts="2160.565" title="2160.325" id=c_"2160.325">__then__</span> not a, a narrative way. Like things don't happen or change in a, in narrative context, but there's a narrative in the sense that things happen over time. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b>And I, I wouldn't say that the, the visuals, so often these visuals are just light Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> so there's no objects or, or there's no physical thing other than just color that's being changed that is kind of more devoid of, of content. Although that wasn't necessarily the reason why we started doing that. Right. But 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It's kind <span style="color:red" data-ts="2190.045" data-end_ts="2190.125" title="2190.045" id=c_"2190.045">__of__</span> abstract by definition almost. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b>Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Like, it, it isn't, and that actually kind of evolved. So I, I had a long standing project, so when I was using the hardware sampler, it was with my partners. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2200.285" data-end_ts="2200.485" title="2200.285" id=c_"2200.285">__Well__</span>, we had, for many years we did these performances where she would have a, like a really huge stretched canvas that had contact mics on it. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And then she would, she would make a, a large painting, and I would process the sounds of this happening. I see. So you'd get a lot of like, like these kind of, I mean, I have one next to me. That's right. Okay. A lot of these sounds, and it, it <span style="color:red" data-ts="2221.125" data-end_ts="2221.405" title="2221.125" id=c_"2221.125">__kinda__</span> was born out of that in that <span style="color:red" data-ts="2222.945" data-end_ts="2223.165" title="2222.945" id=c_"2222.945">__it__</span>, there was an unfortunate thing that when we'd finished these performances, there was a painting left Yeah. <laugh>, which 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b>It was divorced of what happened. Like, it was the equivalent of having the whole audio shrunk down to like one second. Right. But like in a physical thing. So it's, it's a, a painting and it's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2238.285" data-end_ts="2238.525" title="2238.285" id=c_"2238.285">__something__</span> quite often it's aesthetically pleasing, but it's not representative of what happened. Right. So in that sense it was, it was problematic in that like, okay, now we have this thing to deal with. Yeah. So it was, it was, it was some of a reaction against that. Okay. So if we have, if it's just light, there's no object. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2253.415" data-end_ts="2253.765" title="2253.415" id=c_"2253.415">__Right__</span>. There's nothing, there's, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>There's nothing left at the end of the show. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b>Exactly. It, it's just as ephemeral as the audio, it's, it's just process that happened. Yeah. Yeah. So that it was kind of born from that interest and then, okay, so we have lights and then we, we set up a projector, and then eventually we got actual stage lights and then, and then built from there. But, so I guess in that sense, it, it's, it's a trajectory of, of Denar. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b>Yeah. <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>New word invented here. Yay. <laugh>, you kind mentioned, kind of offhandedly about some interaction with, Feld, which is gaining quite a reputation now. Yeah. And you know, some of it is because the people involved Tremlin and, Alex Harker and some of these folks and yourself as well. First of all, what is your interaction with with the school? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b>Yeah. I'm, I'm in the, the final stages of a PhD in Composition Okay. At the University of Hunters <span style="color:red" data-ts="2311.045" data-end_ts="2311.165" title="2311.045" id=c_"2311.045">__Field__</span>. So I've been there, like a few months into my fourth year. So I did it over three years, and now I'm just in a, like a writing up period. Got 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>It. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b>And before that, I've, I've known PA for, for many years before that, where we had shared a stage like maybe seven, eight years ago, something like that. He performed and I performed at the time I was doing my hardware stuff and we got to emailing and just kind of got along, and then we just sort of met up for a recording session and did that. And then we just, we gigged that kind of happened for, for a bunch of years. And meanwhile, I did a, an ma in electric acoustic composition in the University of Man, university of Manchester, which is where I live. Okay. And when I was getting to the end of that, I was, I was maybe thinking of leaving, like moving to Germany or something. I, I was kind of, I wasn't sure what I was gonna do. And I got the opportunity to do, a PhD in Hunters <span style="color:red" data-ts="2359.085" data-end_ts="2359.205" title="2359.085" id=c_"2359.085">__Field__</span> for free. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b>Like, I got like a fee waiver and I was like, all right, I plan on doing this at some point, but might as well do it now. Sure. And it's been really great. Like it's, it's, the community there is fantastic. Like, I've grown as a, as sort of an artist in, in every capacity there, independent of like, so there's quite tech heavy people, so like Trembley and Harker and stuff. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But there's a really strong, so I have dual supervision, and my other supervisor <span style="color:red" data-ts="2385.525" data-end_ts="2385.685" title="2385.525" id=c_"2385.525">__is__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2385.685" data-end_ts="2385.925" title="2385.685" id=c_"2385.685">__Brynn__</span> Harrison, who's a, a sort of paper composer, does a lot of instrumental music. Aaron Cassidy does a lot of instrumental music. So there's a strong department for that as well. Right. But it's very integrated. So the, the community is it, it is people who are making, you know, weird dance music in the same room of someone doing like this really hyper complex notated music at the same room with someone who does conceptual art, you know, involving toothbrushes and stuff. <laugh>. Right, right. And it, any, anything that I'd be interested in doing, there's somebody who there, who's a badass at it. Right. So with, with programming there is badass programmers, if there's performers, there's Badass <span style="color:red" data-ts="2419.645" data-end_ts="2419.765" title="2419.645" id=c_"2419.645">__Pro__</span>, there's, and it, it's such a community where the, the level of discourse is so high that it, it's just, you just get better at everything. It's just been fantastic. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I I'm always curious when, when you see places crop up as sort of becoming important. And I would certainly say Hunters <span style="color:red" data-ts="2438.045" data-end_ts="2438.165" title="2438.045" id=c_"2438.045">__Field__</span> is, is there, right. And a lot of it is due to sort of the, the fact that Alex's work has started to become pretty widely known, but also that, some of the other people there are doing work that's catching a lot of people's attention. I'm always curious about what it is that causes that to happen. And I think you might have hit on something there, which is when you find yourself in that environment, it puts you in a position where you have to step up your game to even be part of it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b>Yeah. Yeah. I mean, for sure. I felt that, like, I, I remember my first lecture coming in and just being like, holy, like, what, what's going on <laugh>? What's happening? <laugh>. Right. And then, and then you get your bearing, you go from there. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But I think with Hunters <span style="color:red" data-ts="2482.845" data-end_ts="2482.965" title="2482.845" id=c_"2482.845">__Field__</span> in particular, there's, there's really a nice thing where it was, there was no house style. Right. Like, I was kind of not really encouraged. Everybody's free to do their own thing. And it's, it's all, I've never had to really defend any weird tangent that I wanted to go on. 'cause it was like they, they're such an eccentric place that they welcome that. Even like, so at the moment I'm finishing my thesis, which is I'm doing as like a web thesis with all these really quirky, interactive things. And like chapters are infinite loops and, and, and self-destructive and this kind of stuff. And, and they're into it. Like <span style="color:red" data-ts="2515.805" data-end_ts="2515.965" title="2515.805" id=c_"2515.805">__they__</span>, they're, they're kinda welcoming that approach where it isn't, it isn't the typical thing. And that's, I guess kind of what they're getting known for. And it, it's been really great for me to be a part of that. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, that's actually great to hear because so often, so often, especially when you get to the master's and PhD level, you end up working with advisors that really want you to be a different version of them. Yeah. And it sounds like this is, it's really encouraged for you to go the other way at Huntersville and that's great. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b>Yeah. Yeah. Even to the point that it's, it's discouraged to kind of do that. So <laugh> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2547.805" data-end_ts="2548.045" title="2547.805" id=c_"2547.805">__capacity__</span>, he's, he, he does a lot of this complex instrumental music and then he kind of, people will come to him to study for that. You know, that's, that's <span style="color:red" data-ts="2555.085" data-end_ts="2555.205" title="2555.085" id=c_"2555.085">__a__</span> thing that generally happens. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2556.065" data-end_ts="2556.285" title="2556.065" id=c_"2556.065">__And__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2556.285" data-end_ts="2556.365" title="2556.285" id=c_"2556.285">__then__</span> he'll often not kinda 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Wave him off, huh. Yeah. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b>Yeah. <laugh>, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>That's great. So, our time is running, running out here. Thank you, so much for taking the time outta your schedule to talk with me. One last thing. What do you see in the near and far future for yourself? You know, you've done some really interesting developments up to this point. What do you kind of have in Hopper and what do you hope to do in kind of the long <span style="color:red" data-ts="2586.885" data-end_ts="2587.045" title="2586.885" id=c_"2586.885">__term__</span>? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b>So, I guess some things I've got on deck I've been doing, particularly towards the end of my thesis. I've got this stuff I'm doing with improv analysis. So I've, I've got like a whole system where you can visualize this kind of information and kind of tying this into kind of a meta creative practice where I can have this analyzed improv like data. So kind of a skeletal framework for how I generally behave. And then use this to generate, versions, or kind of <span style="color:red" data-ts="2616.725" data-end_ts="2616.845" title="2616.725" id=c_"2616.725">__a__</span> challenging improv scores based on that data to have a kind of a psychologically augmented creative thing where like the, the human agency is there, but the computer agency is there, like this kind of another one of these gray areas that I was talking about. Sure. So somewhere between improv and then augmented improv and, and psycho-analysis. I don't know, it's, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2638.645" data-end_ts="2638.845" title="2638.645" id=c_"2638.645">__it's__</span> kind of wad of, of stuff pushing forward. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b>That's not very good description. But, that's, quite one of the, the kind of things that's on the horizon as soon as I finish this stuff. And then in the long <span style="color:red" data-ts="2653.045" data-end_ts="2653.205" title="2653.045" id=c_"2653.045">__term__</span>, I don't know. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2653.805" data-end_ts="2654.005" title="2653.805" id=c_"2653.805">__It__</span>, it's, I kinda like the trajectory that I've been doing this, this collapsing where all of it's creative practice. So even at, at the moment for a long time, like if I talk about what I do, like I'm an artist, I make art, like the, the term music has kind of fallen off a bit, right. And as, and composition and performance fell off long before that. So kind of integrating all this stuff. So making software is, is, is something that I like for me, is just another part of a creative process. Right. Or, or, or teaching or sharing or talking to people or making, like, like I put like three months, me and my partner put three months into this tutorial video and it's like, for me it's, it's just another piece of art, like anything else. Sure. So that kind of, just pushing that further and extending into other aspects of my life. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it sounds like both a short and a long term kind of process. Yeah. <laugh>. So that's, that's pretty cool. Well, rod, go, I, I want to again, thank you for your time and thank you for kind of skating around a lot of different things, but I think that we actually uncovered some pretty interesting stuff. So thanks, thanks for that. And thanks for all the cool work that you're doing and you're putting out there and letting people try out. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b>Yeah. I mean, it's my pleasure. I love doing it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Alright, well, I'll talk to you again soon. Catch you later. Bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Rodrigo: </b><span style="color:red" data-ts="2729.285" data-end_ts="2729.525" title="2729.285" id=c_"2729.285">__Alright__</span>, bye. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well there you go. So many thanks to Rodrigo Costanza for spending the time with us to tell us not only about all the different work that he's done, but all the work that he put into thinking about it. This week I want to thank four people for their help with the Kickstarter program. It was very successful. We raised, enough not only to get me an H <span style="color:red" data-ts="2759.945" data-end_ts="2760.165" title="2759.945" id=c_"2759.945">__two__</span> N, but the accessory kit was actually sent to me by another donor. And so I used the remaining money for two things. One, a high capacity memory card so that I'd be able to store more information on the card. And secondly, it paid for one entire year's worth of hosting for the podcast on libsyn.com. So this is a huge help to me and it was great support for the podcast. So for that, I want to thank the following four people, Darren Cowley, Michael Hale, Tony Capal, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="2794.805" data-end_ts="2795.205" title="2794.805" id=c_"2794.805">__Mattis__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="2795.205" data-end_ts="2795.765" title="2795.205" id=c_"2795.205">__Snappers__</span>. These four people were great supporters of the podcast. But I just want to thank everyone that was involved in the Kickstarter campaign. And I want to also thank everyone that listens every week and people that <span style="color:red" data-ts="2810.155" data-end_ts="2810.445" title="2810.155" id=c_"2810.155">__pass__</span> this along to others I really would like to have as wide of a listenership as possible. So I thank you very much for that. With that, I sign out. Bye.
