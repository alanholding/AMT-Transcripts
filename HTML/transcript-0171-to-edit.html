<b>Darwin: </b>Okay, today I have the great pleasure of getting to know somebody. His name is Christophe Cox, and I first ran into him watching this fascinating video that someone on Facebook sent me. It's called The History of Sound Art. And it was done, I believe, for the Barnes Foundation. Is that correct? Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christoph Cox: </b>That's right. Mm-Hmm, <affirmative>. Yeah. Okay. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>And, it was an awesome overview of sort of the history, the, top level view of the history of, of sound art. And it was done in a way that I found really intriguing. It had a neat organization too. It, and I was like, I gotta talk to this guy. So hence we have him on the line. So with that, I'm gonna welcome Christophe Ko. Hey, how's it going? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christoph: </b>Really good. Thanks for, thanks for, talking. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. Thank you so much for taking the time to have the chat. I really appreciate it. Why don't we start off by having you talk a little bit about what you do? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christoph: </b>So, I am, I'm a philosopher, both in my teaching and my writing. I write as a philosopher, but for a long time I've also had an interest in, experimental music and sound art. Initially, those two things were separate. I worked as a critic and, sometime curator in, working on, projects involving art projects involving sound. But, those things in the past decade or so have come together so that I, I'm now writing philosophically a lot about sound and, particularly sound art and also experimental music as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Very cool. What is it, I mean, how much do you find it interacts between, philosophy and sound work? Do you find, do you find there being much crossover, at least in your sort of, like, in your head experience? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christoph: </b>There's a long history of philosophers, thinking particularly about music, but also, more broadly about sound. You know, this goes back to the, to the pythagoreans who were philosophers for whom sound was, was paramount, Plato, Aristotle and, and onward to figures that are probably more important to me, figures in the 19th century, like Arthur Schopenhauer and Friedrich Nietzsche. So there's sound is always, sound and music have always captivated philosophers, in part because they've tried to try to figure out what is this, this peculiar art form music or sound, well later sound art that attracts us. How are we attracted by tones and that need not have any particular reference to the world in the way that a painting might have a reference to the world or a sculpture might, but yet it's, we're really deeply concerned with it. Almost all cultures, all people are deeply concerned with music. And so some, there's a connection to some philosophers have thought music is uniquely abstract, it's uniquely, of among the arts, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, it's uniquely abstract. And so philosophers interested in that level of abstraction have, you know, sort of thought to themselves that maybe philosophy has a kind of unique, unique relationship to, to music and to sound. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, one of the things I was gonna say is that something that really caught me in that video that, that you did was your discussion of this idea that music and sound has kind of a unique place in that we can carry it around like a thought inside of our head, but it's, you know, it's obviously much more complex than a textual thing, right? And so the idea of carrying around this abstraction that's sort of like some representation of a concrete sound, it was really captured my attention. <span style="color:red" data-ts="240.385" data-end_ts="240.605" title="240.385" id=c_"240.385">__It__</span> really got me thinking a lot, right? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christoph: </b>In a way, we do that with all art forms, right? I can say to you, you know, you know, remember Picasso's de <span style="color:red" data-ts="249.205" data-end_ts="249.445" title="249.205" id=c_"249.205">__Mazel__</span> dignon or whatever, and you can say, ah, yeah. And you can conjure a picture in your head, or, you know, remember the, you know, that Wallace Stevens poem and, you know, you can kind of remember it, but sound is, we, we carry, I think in a way, our, <span style="color:red" data-ts="261.705" data-end_ts="261.925" title="261.705" id=c_"261.705">__our__</span> memory of a song or something like that seems kind of richer and fuller and certain, and to unload and to sort of unfold over time in a way that I'm not sure is true with other art forms, or in any case, we certainly do carry these things around with us as a, as a sort of idea 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>For my listeners that not, might not be as clued into the concept of sound art versus music. Could you kind of explain how you, how you think of the difference between the two, what makes something sound art versus an attempt at music? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christoph: </b>Yeah, that's good. So I'll give a couple short stabs at an answer, because it's slightly different depending on who you talk to. So, I mean, the sort of official story, or the kind of more art historical story is that sound art emerged in the late 1960s, and it emerged with figures like, max Newhouse, who was a, an avant-garde percussionist. He was kind of the a a figure who, who was, you know, kind of a go-to guy for a lot of avant-garde composers in, in the sixties. People like <span style="color:red" data-ts="325.165" data-end_ts="325.445" title="325.165" id=c_"325.165">__Carl__</span> hunch, Carl Hench Stockhouse, and Pierre Boles, John Cage as someone who could just kind of perform anything. And at some point in the late sixties, Newhouse said, that he was no longer interested in presenting work on stage at a specified time and place, right place, that you'd go for a particular concert that he was more interested in presenting sound, almost like a sculpture. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christoph: </b>And just as with a sculpture, you could go in at three o'clock in the afternoon or at 11 in the morning, and the, the sculpture would be there and you would deal with it in your own time. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, it wouldn't be the prescribed time of a performance that happens from seven to seven 30 or something. Newhouse wasn't the only one by, by any means. So one thought definition of of sound art is sound that appears predominantly in visual arts contexts and has as much in common with, say, sculpture or with installation installation practices in the visual arts as it has to do with music. So I don't think there's a clean divide between them, and I certainly wouldn't wanna make that a great number of sound artists, come out of music, come from a musical tradition. I'm thinking of people like Alvin Lucier or Marianne Amache, or Lamont Young, but sometimes also sound artists come from a visual arts background. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christoph: </b>Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> to other variants, I would say of that is, I think over the course of the 20th century, there was, there came to be an interest in something, in, in Sound that was not merely or not simply musical. Right? We can think back to Thomas Edison, Edison invents this machine intended to record speech primarily and perhaps music. But what it really does is it just records all sound indiscriminate. It just records anything that happens to fall on its surface. And so composers and, you know, people interested in technology started to think, well, maybe there's an art of sound that goes beyond music. Maybe we can think of anything that can be recorded musical or not as having a kind of aesthetic interest. So you get people, like in the early 20th century, Luigi Slo thinking about noise. Now Rus <span style="color:red" data-ts="469.365" data-end_ts="469.525" title="469.365" id=c_"469.365">__Low__</span> was initially a painter thinking about maybe, maybe there'd be an aesthetic interest in listening to all the sounds of the city, the noises of trams, the flapping of awnings. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christoph: </b>We don't need to call it music, maybe, we'll, we'll call it something else. Maybe we'll call it as he put it in Art of noises or figures like Edgar Ez who said, you know, maybe music is, a term that people are wedded to. Let's call what we do, the organization of Sounds. Right. So a number, a number of artists are thinking across the 20th century in terms of how might we come up? How might we devise or how might, how might does recording technology enable us to articulate an art of sounds that's maybe not musical? And so that's another variant of what sound art might mean. And the third thing I'll give is that I use the term quite broadly to describe any art form in which sound plays a very sort of central role. So for me, I include figures like, like the filmmaker Luke Fowler, or the filmmaker Manal Debo as sound artist, because I think their work is very focused on sound. I'm not sure they would describe themselves that way, but I think for me, it has that, sense. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Well, and it's interesting you say that because first of all, I tend to embrace that kind of view of it as well. But secondly, maybe that's another thing that really drew me to your presentation to that video that I saw, was that oftentimes you did things, especially as you got to more contemporary works, you were really drawn to these things that were very much an intersection between sound and cinema. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And it seems like, adventurous cinema kind of brought adventurous sound development along with it. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And so who are, like, who are some of the pieces you just mentioned Fowler? I didn't catch who the second one was. I'm sorry. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christoph: </b>Luke Fowler, an artist, Belgian artist named Manal de <span style="color:red" data-ts="586.635" data-end_ts="586.925" title="586.635" id=c_"586.635">__Bore__</span>, D-E-B-O-E-R-I think of figures like, the, the Austrian artist, Mattias Edna is another artist I can think of who I think of as a kind of sound artist, or at least a lot of his work is Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, a group that I focused on in that talk and who is really important to me. A group called the Sensory Ethnography Lab at Harvard University. They are, I wouldn't say they're exclusively sound artists, but they, they work very carefully with sound and the, the sound designer for the sensory ethnographer ethnography lab. Ernst Carroll is someone who is, who's a great sound artist in his own right. And the sound designs he produces for those films really put sound on equal par with image, which is rare, I think, in cinema generally, sound tends to play the supporting role and tends not to be the focus. It tends to be something that glues and stitches things together, but that doesn't sort of drive the, the cinematic spectacle. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Sure. That seems, that seems a fair assessment. Wow. I'm sorry, I just kind of like went, went skating along there. That's, that's fascinating stuff. Now, one of the things I like to do in my podcast is I like to talk to people about how they got to be the artists or thinkers or designers or whatever that they are. And I am especially curious for someone to, to hear about how you grow up to become a philosopher slash sound art and experimental music person. <laugh>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christoph: </b>Yeah. Yeah. Right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I, I'm curious to know, what your, what your trek was, what your journey was to get there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christoph: </b>So for me, probably like most of the people you interview, music has always been a, a, a, a really important aspect of my life and something that I just always felt compelled to explore in the sense that not, you know, I, I'm always, I was always happy listening to the radio and whatever, but I was happy with, I was always curious about artists who make sounds that puzzle me or make music that puzzle me. Sometimes that puzzlement is, you know, I'm puzzled, but I'm not interested. But other times it, it was, you know, like trying to follow a certain train, like, huh, why would someone do that with sounds? Why would, and so, you know, you, you sort of listen and follow this stuff, and it leads you in a variety of directions. And, you know, probably like a lot of people, I grew up, you know, listening to pop and listening to, you know, <span style="color:red" data-ts="736.435" data-end_ts="736.725" title="736.435" id=c_"736.435">__prog__</span> rock and, you know, eventually the sort of more experimental variance of, you know, experimental rock or progressive rock. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christoph: </b>I was always, I, I played classical music for forever. I was a pianist. I was never as good as I should have been, given how long I'd played. But, but I was, you know, but at the same time, I was very attracted to philosophy, particularly when I, when I was an undergraduate. So I pretty much followed that, that the philosophical train through graduate school and music was always something there in the, on the side for me, but not an academic interest. And so I, I ended up writing a dissertation and then a book on Nietzsche who's a philosopher, who's been really important for me. As I mentioned earlier, Nietzsche is unique, well, not unique, but he's, he's among a small group of philosophers who were really, really driven by, by music I mean, Nietzsche remarks at some point, you know, without music, life would be a mistake. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christoph: </b>You know, I think he, and <span style="color:red" data-ts="796.585" data-end_ts="796.805" title="796.585" id=c_"796.585">__hi__</span>, his first book, the Birth of Tragedy, really tries to give a, a metaphysical account of music, right. To think of music metaphysically. He's, he's proceeded by an earlier philosopher whom I also mentioned, Arthur Schopenhauer, for whom music is really important. So anyway, these things, so they, they came together sort of, and I was working, as I said, as a, as a critic and, and then later as a curator. But the <span style="color:red" data-ts="820.245" data-end_ts="820.365" title="820.245" id=c_"820.245">__p__</span> but the tracks were sort of parallel until I, I came to Hampshire College and, and there are no departments at the college in which I, teach. No. I mean, I have an appointment in philosophy, but there's no philosophy department. So professors are very encouraged to kind of co-teach with one another, to collaborate with one another. And a composer said to me, we should co-teach a course together. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christoph: </b>I mean, I know you're interested in this stuff. I'm interested in it. Let's, let's do a course. And so we started to teach a course, that came to be called Audio Culture out of which, and, and we edited a book out of that, course. And so anyway, the interest started, the interest that started out being parallel, kind of, converged. And I guess I think of music in a way, the way I think of philosophy. I'm always interested in some philosophers are interested in kind of justifying what already exists, right? In other words, here, here's what I think is true. Here's what I think is right. And now I'm going to come up with, a set of arguments to justify them. Other argument, other philosophers, I think, think of philosophy as a more kind of experimental enterprise. Like, what could the world be? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christoph: </b>What could, how could the world be other than it is, or how could I think it other than it is? And I'm always attracted to those philosophers, and I see them as a akin to the musicians that I am, that I'm attracted to. How could I do something differently with sound? How could you do something other with sound? And so, in that way, I think both philosophy and sound have a similar impulse. And I, I tend to be attracted to, to philosophers who say things that, that strike me as that, that I wouldn't have otherwise thought. And I'm attracted to musicians that way too. And so it's nice to sort of bring those two things together <span style="color:red" data-ts="925.745" data-end_ts="925.965" title="925.745" id=c_"925.745">__and__</span> to philosophical writing about sound and music. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>So now, how did you, how did you end up finding yourself being a critic of experimental music and, you know, how did that part of your parallel tracks, how did that develop? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christoph: </b>Well, it's a little bit older than this. I was doing it in, in college. I was probably like a lot of people. I not only listened to a lot of music, but I read a lot of music journalism and read a lot of, read a lot of writing about music. Some people are not interested in that. They'd prefer just to listen to things and not read about it. But I I, I've always been someone who's been really interested in, in reading kind of about music and thinking about music critically. I always, I sort of tried my hand at that in college, but really, it wasn't until the mid 1990s when two compilations of music that I quite loved came out dedicated to one of my favorite philosophers. There were two, two CDs, dedicated to the French philosophers <span style="color:red" data-ts="985.865" data-end_ts="986.085" title="985.865" id=c_"985.865">__GI__</span> Delos, who had died the previous year. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christoph: </b>Right. One was a compilation called, IM Memoriam, <span style="color:red" data-ts="991.945" data-end_ts="992.165" title="991.945" id=c_"991.945">__Gil__</span> Delo, that came out with the, the German Electronic Music Label <span style="color:red" data-ts="996.485" data-end_ts="996.765" title="996.485" id=c_"996.485">__Meal__</span> Plateau, also named after one of Dee's books, right? And the other one was a compilation called, folds and Rhizomes for <span style="color:red" data-ts="1004.745" data-end_ts="1004.965" title="1004.745" id=c_"1004.745">__Gil__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1005.015" data-end_ts="1005.365" title="1005.015" id=c_"1005.015">__Delos__</span> that came out of the Belgian Experimental Music label, sub Rosa. And so it, it struck me that, you know, okay, here's music I love dedicated to a philosopher I love. And yet this music doesn't seem to have any direct relationship to <span style="color:red" data-ts="1019.615" data-end_ts="1019.965" title="1019.615" id=c_"1019.615">__Delos__</span>. So it, it proposed for me a kind of puzzle, a kind of problem, how can this music, which doesn't, you know, which doesn't seem to relate directly to this philosopher, how can it connect? So I took that as a, as the project for a piece that I wrote for Art Forum wasn't, it wasn't a particularly a philosophical piece. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christoph: </b>It was really just a, a kind of, I don't know, kind of critical exploration. And then from then I thought, wow, that was a lot of fun. So then I started writing, I was living in Chicago at the time, and, there was a great music scene as there always is in Chicago, great experimental music scene. And so that English music magazine, the Wire said, you know, Hey, you've been writing about this interesting musical stuff. There's alsos of stuff going on in Chicago. Why don't you do that writing? And so then I ended up writing that stuff, not so much as a philosopher, but just as a critic and someone who is out there in the world, you know, interested in this stuff. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, it's interesting that, that that was your approach. I'm curious about why it is there that there are certain philosophers that artists and that artists really particularly latch onto. And, and to <span style="color:red" data-ts="1082.765" data-end_ts="1082.885" title="1082.765" id=c_"1082.765">__lose__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="1082.885" data-end_ts="1083.085" title="1082.885" id=c_"1082.885">__is__</span> certainly is a good example of that, right? I mean, that's taught more in art school at this point than most art historians work has done, right? Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christoph: </b>That's 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>True. It is. It's a thing that has really taken, really gotten legs in the artistic community. What do you think, what do you think is, why do you think that is? Why is it that these few people become sort of like almost the philosophical center for artists and musicians? What, what in particular do you think it is about them that draw in people also interested in the arts? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christoph: </b>Yeah. It's hard for me to say, and I'm always really interested in which artists, which, which philosophers artists are particularly drawn to. I mean, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1125.095" data-end_ts="1125.445" title="1125.095" id=c_"1125.095">__Delos__</span> is definitely really foremost among them. Right. In an earlier generation, Ludwig Wienstein was someone whom a lot of artists were drawn to, and, and composers and musicians as well. And then there's some really important philosophers that aren't, that artists are mysteriously sort of either uninterested in or allergic to <laugh>. Yeah, I don't, I don't, I, I can't say what that is. I mean, with, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1150.095" data-end_ts="1150.445" title="1150.095" id=c_"1150.095">__dolus__</span> writes about art and music a bit, but he writes about everything, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1154.205" data-end_ts="1154.405" title="1154.205" id=c_"1154.205">__right__</span>? And so that it's not particularly prominent in his writing, that maybe that's not quite true. Something like cinema's quite prominent in his writing. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But I, I think it may just be a kind of, that these are philosophers who sort of loosen thought or they, they sort of make thought more flexible and supple, and that enables artists to maybe sort of loosens the bounds of their thinking and, and making, in ways they find sympathetic. Yeah. I'm trying to think of other philosophers who are, who, who have played that role. I mean, I think Nietzsche has for a lot of, a lot of artists, maybe in a slightly older generation. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Hmm. Well, now you talk about this loosening of the, of bounds. It sounds to me like for you, you know, if we get a little more personal, that your selection of where you teach is also provided that for you personally, in that, this kind of opportunity that comes up at Hampshire College, because they don't have departments. You get to kind of, you get to kind of define yourself and define your direction in, in a pretty flexible or supple way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christoph: </b>Yeah, that's true. I mean, I, I guess my education has been mostly like that. I was an undergraduate at Brown University where that kind of sense of interdisciplinarity. And there my major was modern culture and media, so it was very broad. And then I was a graduate student in University of California Santa Cruz, where I was in a <span style="color:red" data-ts="1248.205" data-end_ts="1248.525" title="1248.205" id=c_"1248.205">__inter__</span> interdisciplinary PhD program called the History of Consciousness Program. So I guess throughout all of this, that kind of, interdisciplinarity or, I don't <span style="color:red" data-ts="1257.445" data-end_ts="1257.485" title="1257.445" id=c_"1257.445">__know__</span> if interdisciplinary is the best word, but kind of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1259.745" data-end_ts="1259.965" title="1259.745" id=c_"1259.745">__the__</span> sort of flexibility and, and translatability across disciplines has always been important to me. I love philosophy. I love it as a discipline. I love its history, and it, I, it's something that certainly I find it to be my home discipline, and yet I always want to draw other things into it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christoph: </b>Jus taught at, at the, an experimental university in the University of Paris system, Sen <span style="color:red" data-ts="1284.155" data-end_ts="1284.445" title="1284.155" id=c_"1284.155">__Sand__</span>. And he too said that his seminars would always be, be full of philosophers, of course, but of architects and filmmakers and artists. And he thought he found it tremendously sort of enlivening to have to speak, not only to philosophers, but also to speak to a range of particularly artists, architects, et cetera. And I find the same thing. I, I want to, I find it engaging for me to have to address myself or to have to address what I'm talking about philosophically to an audience that is, making things out in the world, not simply philosophical. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, I think, you know, frankly, I think that interdisciplinary is actually the right word. Unfortunately, it's gotten such a reputation, or it's gotten so overloaded with academic meaning that it kind of becomes, unfortunately, the tag that nobody wants. Right, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christoph: </b>Right, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Which is unfortunate, because conceptually it seems like education, the best of education could be. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christoph: </b>I mean, I think everybody acknowledges that. I think everybody acknowledges that, you know, the world doesn't come in these packets, <laugh>, you know, the world doesn't come in these packets. That is, this is physics, this is philosophy, this is mathematics. It's, you know, the, the world comes to us. And as a sort of totality, we divide it up this way. I mean, for good reason, it's a kind of division of labor. But I think when you see students at an institution like Hampshire, they're, they're very unconcerned that this is a philosophy course, or that this is an art history course. They're just, they sort of swim through this much more fluidly and aren't worried about those disciplinary boundaries, which I think is right. Yeah.

<b>Darwin: </b>So one of the things when, when we talk about particularly the concept of sound art, sound is art. One of the things that I think makes it difficult to speak in, in pure art terms is that there isn't much in the way of actual artifacts unless it ends up interacting with some of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1413.205" data-end_ts="1413.285" title="1413.205" id=c_"1413.205">__the__</span> other medium. So I think maybe that's one of the reasons why cinema, why like experimental cinema and sound art ends up tagged together, because then it makes sense as sort of an artifact, right? But a lot of times, much like performance art for, for example, there's almost the need for an experience. There's no way to have an artifact that isn't part of the experience of its origin. Does that make sense? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, am I making sense with that? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christoph: </b>Yeah. I mean, the way the, the hist, I think of the history of sound art, at least one of the histories of sound art, is that when it arose with people like Lamont Young and Alvin, Lucia and Max Newhouse in the late, late 1960s, it arose within the context of what the art curator and theorist Lucy Lapard called the dematerialization of the art object. So in, in the late 1960s, a lot of artists, particularly in America, the US and well, I guess also in Europe and Japan, were interested in making art that wasn't about making art objects. They were interested in either in making experiences or in making events. And I, I think sound art grew up in that context. So in the context, for example, of conceptual art in which artists thought, what if a work of art could be not, not an object, not a thing, but it could be an idea, it could be a concept. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christoph: </b>I think of people like, like Lawrence Wiener, who, who said, I, I make these works. You can carry around, you can carry them around with you in your head. You know, I propose it, but you, you can own it, and you can have it simply by, you know, in a sense reading it and carrying it around with you. So sound art emerged in that context, and it emerged in the context where all sorts of very ephemeral art forms, like performance art, like light art, like expanded cinema, also more experimental forms of dance, all of these were, were kind of ephemeral phenomena that that didn't have an, a lasting object. They weren't like paintings or sculptures that, that remained. They also, I think, were difficult to photograph and to document. And a lot of artists, some, some of the artists that that interest me in that domain, the late sixties, early seventies domain, were specifically interested in making artworks that weren't objects because they were trying to, in a sense, offer a kind of anti commodified art, or a sort of, even a kind of anti-capitalist art. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christoph: </b>I'm gonna make art that can't be bought and sold. Why? Because it's not an object. It's not a, it's not a commodity. And so sound art is, sound emerged in that context really powerfully, because sound, as we know, is something that's powerfully physical that affects us deeply. And yet it vanishes. And while you can capture a musical performance on a tape or a record or a cd, it's less, or an MP three, it's less, capturing a sound installation in which the architecture of the room, for example, is as important a part of the piece as simply the sound that becomes, you can see how sound becomes really part of that project, part of that historical project. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>You know, and it's, it's funny that you mention particularly the architecture of the room, because for me, so much of sound art falls apart if I'd listen to a recording of it, because it isn't part of the room. But the one that sort of like breaks that is Alvin Lucier as I'm sitting in a room, because in fact, the whole point of it was to document the ongoing effect of the room <laugh>, you know? So in a way, the recording includes the sound of the room, but other than that, it's a, it's a great point. And also this, this concept of sort of like anti commercial art is important, but it's almost as if the concept of, or like the overriding concept was important, but it's very hard to, after a relatively short period of time, to kind of put your thumb on the important works and have an imagination of them in a way that you do with other kinds of artwork that has, that has these material artifacts. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah. What is the way that these things live into the future in a way that's vital? So we have dance, but dance doesn't really have a useful notation system, right? Expanded cinema and live cinema generally, it's a very performative kind of thing, rather than a, than a strictly edited and presented thing. You know, we have sound art, which oftentimes either has a very, in the moment processing or it has some sort of interface with, with the artist in a way that doesn't necessarily last beyond the artist's attention. And I, I'm wondering how do these art forms, or how do, how do they maintain not their relevance probably is useful as, as a conceptual thing, but the works themselves. How, how can they be, how can they remain vital? What do you, what do you think is the mechanism by which that could happen? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christoph: </b>That's a really good question. And, and this, the, it's the whole question of collecting and documenting. I mean, the same things arise with performance, as you mentioned, with dance. But in those cases, the documentation is slightly easier 'cause one can videotape a performance and then say about the performance, well, the videotape is not the thing. One can take a photograph of it, but sound isn't easily photographed and it's not easily documented in recording as well. I think this is an issue. I mean, it's an issue. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1764.985" data-end_ts="1765.205" title="1764.985" id=c_"1764.985">__The__</span>, the person that springs to mind for me is Marianne Amache, whom I think is a tremendously important sound artist that very few people know, because she did almost exclusively site specific work. And in, you know, in very particular places, she recorded quite little, given her stature quite little. And her performances, as she says, she says, these are like, I forget the exact analogy she uses, but she says, you know, these, my recordings are just poor documentations of, of, of work. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christoph: </b>Because she tended to work in spaces where she was very interested in structure borne sound that is in the way the sound doesn't just move in through air, but through the walls and floors and infrastructure of buildings, just something you can't really easily reproduce on, on a recording. Yeah. So it's a real issue. I mean, one solution to this, which I've, is an interesting one, but a problematic one is, you mentioned Alvin Lucia as I'm sitting in a room, which is just an absolutely, that's a work that I think is absolutely important, hugely important for me. Sometimes it's considered apropos <span style="color:red" data-ts="1827.965" data-end_ts="1828.085" title="1827.965" id=c_"1827.965">__our__</span> earlier comments about <span style="color:red" data-ts="1829.585" data-end_ts="1829.805" title="1829.585" id=c_"1829.585">__our__</span> earlier discussion about experimental music and sound art for a lot of people, that's just a piece of experimental music for me. I, I think it, it's, it's a seminal work of sound art. But in any case, Luc, as I'm sitting in a room, has been purchased by the Museum of Modern Art in New York. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christoph: </b>And I, I was having a discussion with a colleague who is actually one of, Lucier's students, and he was absolutely puzzled about what that meant, because I'm sitting in a room as a very simple project. It's a text that you can read and you could read it into any space, and anyone could produce that, that work of art. So the question was, what does it mean to own that work of art? And it turns out with MoMA, that MoMA has the, the exclusive rights for the performance of that piece. Now, of course, MoMA's probably not gonna come after some undergraduate who does it in, you know, her dorm room. But, still when, when a colleague of, and a friend of mine wanted to present it in a museum exhibition, she was quickly met with, with the idea that MoMA would not allow it, which is very, very interesting. But that, in that case, that work of art becomes very much like any other work that, you know, that someone owns. They have the rights to, in the same way that a solt wall drawing or something like that, in order for it to be an official solt wall drawing, it has to come with their certificate, with the sign certificate. So anyway, this is, it's, it's a really good question about documentation and, preservation. And that I think is not quite, that that problem is not quite solved. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, and that seems to be almost the case with so much of new media art in general. I had the good fortune to be in Denver and to be involved with the project that was, it was, the exhibit was called Blink, and it was sort of like a collection Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> of lots of different new media presentations. And, they got some really great collections to be presented there. It was, it was phenomenal. But you also look at that and the idea that these things were collectible, but also like in some way, they were documented. I talked to the guy who was the designer of the exhibit, and he was talking about, you know, when, when he went into the archives to, like look at some of the available pieces, he would look at the documentation of their maintenance, and it was like, you know, every year they would come and take out the videotape and measure it to make sure it hadn't shrunk or something. Right? They didn't even know how to deal with things like maintenance and preservation of these things that they were getting. And so it's, so it's really clear that the whole concept of, of ownership, maintenance viability of these artworks over the long term is, is gonna be kind of rough. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christoph: </b>Yeah. I mean, there are some curators who are kind of working on these sorts of things. I think of someone like, Lauren Cornell, who's at the New Museum, who's actually, you know, she has commissioned some kind of new media art projects for the New Museum's website. MoMA has a, a new, you know, all these, so many museums have these kind of curators, but it's tricky. They're, they're very unusual objects, you know, what does it mean to, to own a new media work, to own a even a video game? You know, there's fantastic kind of very artisanal video games. All of this happened when art is no longer a thing and a unique thing that can be exchanged. It becomes an, an issue. I suppose <span style="color:red" data-ts="2041.485" data-end_ts="2041.765" title="2041.485" id=c_"2041.485">__what__</span> an earlier version of this, although much less problematic, is photography. What does it mean to own? I mean, you own a photograph. Do you own a negative? Do you own, right. Yeah, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Yeah, good point. So given all of the difficulties in like determining, you know, what is a piece of sound art and determining, you know, how viable it is to, you know, listen to a recording of it or read about the concept behind it or whatever. One of the things that I've noticed is that the actual study of sound art is also kind of in its infancy, and probably because it hadn't been been self-defined until relatively recently, but let's say that somebody, you know, listening to this for whatever reason has decided, oh my God, this idea of sound art, that's what I really wanna focus on. They are obviously going to have to come up with some mechanism of self-study, because you're not gonna go to really any school and join their sound art department and get a four year curriculum on it. What do you think represents the things you do to at least start off the process of self-study, of sound art, of really getting to know, getting to know kind of the, the core works and the core concepts, the core philosophies behind sound art? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christoph: </b>Yeah, good question. I think there's increasing art. Historians are increasingly interested in sound and, there's, you know, there's been some good art, historical work on sound. People like Liz Coates and, and, Brandon Joseph. There's a young scholar, Charles Epley, who's writing primarily about Max Newhouse. So there are people out here doing that, but it's true. So, so I think, I think, you know, as just as when you study art history, to be able to study, to be able to, to learn about something, maybe even before experiencing it, just to like, like art history, you know, if you're looking the, the <span style="color:red" data-ts="2162.965" data-end_ts="2163.165" title="2162.965" id=c_"2162.965">__famous__</span>, the, the famous paintings or the famous sculptures or drawings or photographs, those are often located somewhere in the world where you will, you maybe will be at some point in your life, but not now. But of course, with those things, you can have decent documentation. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christoph: </b>You know, I can show you a, a photograph of a Gerhard Richter painting, but with sound art, I think, I think there are some things that are, are translatable. So for example, I think something like, Luc <span style="color:red" data-ts="2188.465" data-end_ts="2188.685" title="2188.465" id=c_"2188.465">__as__</span> I'm sitting in a room is a good example where you can, that's something that you can listen to on audio. I mean, you can go to, to <span style="color:red" data-ts="2197.565" data-end_ts="2197.725" title="2197.565" id=c_"2197.565">__bu__</span> web, it's what <span style="color:red" data-ts="2198.885" data-end_ts="2199.445" title="2198.885" id=c_"2198.885">__bu.com__</span>, I think, right? And you can find all these recorded sources. You can come across the films of someone like, like Luke Fowler or, or, Manal Debo, these other folks. So these are not installation works, but they are. But they're also Sound Works. But then there are also people who live anywhere near New York. I always say, well, you know, here, there's, there's some, a good introduction to sound artists to go to Times Square and experience Max Newhouse's piece that's there for free 24 hours a day, seven days a week, <laugh>, or go down to Lamont Young's dream house, on Church Street in lower Manhattan, generally Thursday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday night, there's an installation. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christoph: </b>It's, it's free, or you have to, you know, they, they encourage a donation. So there are, there are things that you can do that is, of course, you have to live near those places. But I think, I think what I've found with my students is that they, they're so interested in music and they have such access to music that they're, they're willing to kind of stretch themselves and imagine something beyond, beyond, you know, the, the sort of musical stuff that they know. And so, they're willing to, to, to try to find stuff that can, that could be called sound art. I think. I think it's hard given, given that it tends to be very site specific, but there are also ways in, right. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>I, I, you mentioned Dreamhouse. I, I can't believe for all the times I've been to New York, I still haven't done that. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, that's the one that I gotta do it so that I don't just end up kicking myself for not having had the opportunity, you know? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christoph: </b>Well, it's another piece actually that was, that was actually recently acquired by Dia, that is that Df, the DIA Foundation, which initially funded the Dreamhouse has purchased that piece from Lamont Young and Marian Zela, who are now, you know, fairly old. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, and they occasionally show that piece in a dedicated space in their space in Chelsea, in, in, in New York. But yeah, so that's another weird case where again, a sound artwork is purchased and every once in a while will be shown, you know, like a film is shown or something. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Right. Interesting. Well, Christophe, this has been a fascinating, thing I've burned through all my time already, but very fascinating. And it just, I mean, I'm just about jumping outta my skin here to go and do some reading and do some more, digging around because, I get really excited by this stuff. I find it very interesting and it has such a great connection to, you know, the, the various kinds of experimentalism I just love. Anyway, so I appreciate you spending the time, kind of opening some doors for us and chatting about this, this kind of intersection between philosophy and, and sound and music. I, I just find it amazing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christoph: </b>It's my pleasure. Really, really pleasure to talk to you. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Well, great. And with that, I'm gonna let you go. Have a great day. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Christoph: </b>Thank you. You too 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b>Many thanks to Christophe for hanging out and having a chat about basically everything about sound art. It was really interesting to hear about his, view of things. If you get a chance, you're gonna want to check out his audio cultures book. It looks like there might be a new revised version coming out shortly, but it was a really influential book for me when I was in school. And, I think it's pretty amazing, piece of work. Also, check out that video that I referred to several times. It's called History of Sound Art. It's, it was sponsored by the Barnes Foundation and it's really worth watching, especially if you're kind of new to the idea of sound art. So in any case, I hope that you enjoyed this chat. Feel free to drop me a line if you have any questions. I've been getting some really nice email from folks recently. I appreciate that a lot. And otherwise, I will catch you next week. Thanks a lot. Bye.
